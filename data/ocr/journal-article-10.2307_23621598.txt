Indeed, in a year when the domestic and international press has lingered on cuts, redundancies and closures, on the shocking armed raid on the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games and thefts such as that of Pablo Picasso's 'Head of a Woman' (a gift to the Greek people in recognition of their resistance to the Nazi occupation) from the National Gallery of Art, more reflective discussion is vital. In Athens, powerful images of protest in the city centre rightly drew attention to human stories as well as to the significant damage done to the city's historical architecture (a particularly poignant casualty being Schiller's Neo-classical building which housed the Attikon cinema on Stadiou Street). But it is also the case that the archaeology of Athens has never been better understood or better presented to the visiting public at many locations around the city. As Robert Pitt's chapter in this year's AG brings home, there is much to draw visitors to Athens and Attica. A major achievement of the former Ministry of Culture and Tourism (now the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports) has been the online publication of Altó to avamcatpiKO 'Epyo zcov Eçopeicov Apxawzrjuov, a richly-illustrated review, region by region, of major discoveries made between 2000 and 2010 (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes). The wealth of information thus made freely accessible pervades both the print and online editions of AG. Regional fascicules of the print Archaiologikon Deltion continue to appear (the latest covering Thessaly and central Greece) but the costs, and time-lag, involved in their production make it likely that here too, e-publication may soon be the most practical option. Online access is also helping to make many museum collections widely accessible, both via the Ministry's Digital Collections portal (http://collections. culture.gr/) and the extension of the Google Art Project to the Acropolis Museum (http://www.googleartproject.com/ collection/acropolis-museum/). These developments are of course good news for researchers. And without wishing to understate the impact of the financial crisis in terms of redundancies, site closures and limits to opening hours, the battle to sustain and develop cultural tourism is also being fought in many, creative ways. Certain long-awaited developments can be reported, notably the reopening of the site of Akrotiri on Thera, under its impressive new roof. Museums, which (with striking exceptions such as the Acropolis Museum) have tended to attract fewer visitors than archaeological sites, are experimenting with free Sunday openings, a wider range of cultural events and unified ticketing linking sites, museums and monuments in many parts of the country, developing the highly successful seven-day ticket for central Athenian monuments. Greek culture has been brought to wider audiences worldwide with a series of major loan exhibitions: Alexander the Great in the Ashmolean Museum and the Musée du Louvre, Transition from Byzantium to Christianity - Art in Late Antiquity, Third to Seventh Century AD in the Onassis Foundation, New York, and The Tale of Cupid and Psyche in the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. And in Greece, the current exhibition at the National Museum in Athens, The Antikythera Shipwreck. The Ship, the Hoards - the Mechanism, which brings together all parts of the Antikythera mechanism (plus several reconstructions) with sections of the ship and its entire cargo, is one of the most memorable (and lauded) for many years. Readers of AG may be interested to know that the annual London lecture of the British School, to be held in the British Academy in February 2013, will be delivered on the subject of this exhibition by one of its senior curators, Dr Anastasia Gadolou. This is not an isolated example - notable exhibitions in other institutions have celebrated Islands off the Beaten Track. An Archaeological Journey to the Greek Islands ofKastellorizo, Symi, Halki, Tilos and Nisyros (Museum of Cycladic Art); Abdera - New York - London - Athens (Numismatic Museum); Icons from the Thracian Shore of the Black Sea (Thessaloniki, Museum of Byzantine Culture); Greeks and Phoenicians, the Crossroads of the Mediterranean (Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki); and Classical Athens, Music and Democracy (Athens, Foundation of Parliament). Plans for new museums also advance. The architec tural contest for the development of the former SILO building in Piraeus to house Greece's first Museum of Maritime Archaeology is now in progress, and the Byzantine Museum of the Argolid is due to open in the Capodistrian barracks in Argos early next year (this will be the first museum in the Peloponnese also to cover Venetian, Frankish and Ottoman cultures). The Argos barracks, originally a Venetian hospital built in 1690, became an agora under Ottoman rule, and were intended to house a university after the liberation of Greece, when the new government bought the large area of land later transformed into cavalry barracks by Capodistrias. After a less fortunate recent history, the transformation of this historic building into a museum is a most welcome devel opment, and forms part of a trend also reflected in the plan to transfer the Archaeological Museum of Pylos to the newly restored Ottoman Niokastro (built in 1573). Preservation of the early modem industrial heritage of Greece - buildings, equipment, and physical and oral</page><page sequence="2">CATHERINE MORGAN records - has for many years been the particular focus of the Piraeus Bank Cultural Foundation (PIOP, http://www.piop.gr/). PIOP maintains an expanding network of museums celebrating the local industries of Greece (from brick-manufacture in Volos to mastic production on Chios), educational and publishing programmes, and an exceptional archive documenting rapidly disappearing crafts. The Europa Nostra award made to the Foundation in 2012 is fitting recognition of its outstanding work in an area of early modern archaeology which has received less coverage in AG than it deserves. Restoration and conservation of other monuments also continue. As ever, theatres attract particular attention, with work continuing at Dodona, Kassope, Epidauros (notably the Little Theatre) and Karthaia on Kea, and new studies being prepared for Nikopolis, Delphi, Delos, Eretria and Orchomenos in Arkadia. Other major projects include the Lycaeum in Athens, with work on the Late Classical tower at Agia Marina and the stadium tunnel at Nemea both now complete. The European Union's national support framework (ESPA) has been a lifeline, supporting the conservation and public presentation of sites in many regions. But a key role has also been played by charitable bodies, including the Elliniki Etaireia Perivallontos kai Politismou, the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and the John S. Latsis Public Benefit Foundation (which, in collaboration with Eurobank EFG publishes freely online a series of lavishly-illustrated publications of Greek museum collections, the most recent of which, on the Pella Museum - http://www.latsis foundation.org/default.asp?pid=92&amp;la=2&amp;bID=69&amp;libID =1 - was published in 2011). Work on theatres has been greatly advanced by the energy of the Diazoma organi zation (http://www.diazoma.gr/) which is now engaged with almost 50 theatres in close collaboration with the Archaeological Service. Its work encompasses archae ology but also wider scholarship and outreach, notably in the development of apps for mobile phones and ¡Pads, in collaboration with Apple, which will provide virtual tours of 125 theatres, odeia, amphitheatres, bouleuteria and stadia (the theatres of Messene and Epidauros being the first to appear later this year). In previous years I have highlighted the problem of illegal excavation and antiquities' trafficking, which is inevitably growing as economic circumstances deteriorate, and frequently forms part of wider criminal activity. The many seizures that have been reported over the past year, while the tip of the iceberg, are a tribute to assiduous policing and growing public awareness. In 2011-2012 the largest ring yet found in Greece was broken with a series of arrests. The ring was active right across central and northern Greece, people from all walks of life were impli cated, and some 10,000 objects (from Cycladic marble figurines to Byzantine icons) recovered. In short, there is growing evidence for a major international commercial operation with connections across Europe and beyond. Indeed, evidence uncovered has led to the reopening of a number of past cases. The precise extent of damage done to archaeological sites, and the loss of crucial contextual evidence, can readily be imagined. An indication is given by the discovery in 2011 of a cache of Archaic metalwork and other finds linked to the activities of the ring, which must come from a minimum of five burials in an as yet unidentified Macedonian cemetery. The collection includes a so far unique pair of solid gold soles and a silver phiale with a gold omphalos identical to one from Sindos (perhaps even from the same mould). Despite similarities with finds from Sindos and Archontiko Giannitson near Pella, no illegal excavation has been reported at these well-documented sites, and the material seized seems therefore to come from a previously undocumented site. Investigation of the ring is ongoing, but the progress made so far is a tribute to patient policing, public engagement and international collaboration. A continuing campaign to educate the wider public about the real cost and conse quences of illicit antiquities dealing and illegal excavation included an exhibition - ApyaioKanf/.ia réÀoç/An End to Antiquities Theft - in the Archaeological Museum in Thessaloniki, which displayed (mostly for the first time) objects recovered over several decades, and the exhibition in the Byzantine Museum, Ioannina, of a rich collection of icons stolen from churches, mostly in Epirus and western Macedonia, and returned by dealers in London and Amsterdam. Plainly, complex questions surround the practice of archaeology during an exceptionally difficult period in Greek history. Public policy in the area of culture will continue to be prominently debated. But while change is more likely to be felt in the medium term, it is worth drawing attention to infrastructure programmes which have the potential to affect the way we work. One such is the registry of archaeological sites, monuments and properties being developed alongside the regular land and woodland registries - a huge undertaking, especially when one considers that many small Aegean islands are effec tively big sites in their own right (Symi, for example, with only 2,500 inhabitants has 159 declared sites). This is not something that can be achieved quickly, but it will be a major resource, enabling GIS-based fore-searches, building project evaluations and much more - a significant change in approach to a record which has built up gradually over many decades. In closing, however, I return to the archaeological achievements which are the essence of AG, and where yet again there is much to celebrate. A personal highlight was the online publication and (live-streamed) conference presenting the work of the international team researching the outstandingly rich Geometric and Archaic deposit found in a basement at Methoni in Pieria back in 2003. This dump of amphorae and pottery, deposited around 700 BC, included the richest collection of transport amphorae in the early Greek world (many local products plus vessels from Phoenicia, East Greece and Euboia) and 191 sherds bearing graffiti, trademarks and fuller texts. The first publication transforms our understanding of this region (http://ancdi alects.greeklanguage.gr/ sites/default/files/studies/methoni _pierias_l.pdf). The year was also marked by the passing at the age of 92 ofNikolaos Yalouris, a distinguished figure in the Archaeological Service and excavator of many sites in the Peloponnese (Elis in particular). It is fitting that his achievements are marked by Daniel Stewart in his chapter on the Peloponnese below.</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 THE WORK OF THE BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS, 2011-2012' Catherine Morgan British School at Athens Greece is going through hard times, and the financing of teaching and research in the UK is tighter than in recent years. But despite the difficult economic climate in which we now operate, the range and scope of School activity is wider than ever. I begin this survey of the 2011-2012 session with our educational activity. We continue to teach undergraduate and postgraduate training courses — the annual undergraduate summer school (which has just celebrated its 40th anniversary) and, in 2011, postgraduate courses on Greek epigraphy (in collaboration with the Epigraphical Museum and the Athenian Agora Excavations; Fig. 1) led by the Assistant Director and Dr Graham Oliver (Liverpool) and on ceramic petrology led by the Fitch Laboratory Director and Dr Ruth Siddall (UCL). The latter offered laboratory training, plus field tuition on Aegina which gave practical experience of prospection for, and sampling of, raw materials and the opportunity to observe potting practices in a traditional workshop (Fig. 2). Our seminar activity is also 1.

The School is grateful for the generous hospitality extended by the Secretary General of the Archaeological Society, Dr Vasileios Petrakos, by the Department of Archaeology of the Aristotle University and by the President of the British Academy, Professor Sir Adam Roberts. The British School expresses its warmest thanks to the Secretary General of the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports, Dr Lina Mendoni, the Director General of Antiquities, Dr Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki, the Director of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, Dr Nikoletta Divari-Valachou, and the Director of Byzantine Antiquities, Dr Evgenia Gerousi, and to the numerous colleagues in the Archaeological Service who make our work possible. We particularly thank the Directors in the regions in which our major fieldwork seasons took place: Dr Athanasia Kanta (23rd EPCA, Herakleion), Dr Maria-Photeini Papakonstantinou (14th EPCA, Lamia), Mrs Amalia Karapaschalidou and Mrs Vassiliki Giannouli (ll,h EPCA, Chalkis) and Dr Angeliki Simosi (EMA). . 2.

In addition to well-established Upper House research seminars and collaborations such as the Fitch Wiener seminar in science-based archaeology, the School now runs seminar series in modern history and anthropology with the École française d'Athènes and in ancient philosophy with the Research Centre for Greek Philosophy of the Academy of Athens. In the latter area, Dr Katerina Ierodiakonou's generous pledge of the unique library in ancient and medieval philosophy created by the late Professor Michael Frede (Oxford) will make the School library a world-class resource for the study of Greek philosophy. It has long been our aim to make widely accessible the rich output of our research programme, not only in print but via electronic media. Thanks to generous sponsorship, a library of recordings of conferences, lectures and workshops can now be found at www.bsa.ac.uk. The focus of the School's 2011 publications was Crete, with new volumes on Karphi (L. Preston Day, The Pottery from Karphi. A Reappraisal) and Knossos (S. Hood and G. Cadogan, Knossos Excavations 1957-1961. Early Minoari). A major Fitch Laboratory research programme on Aegina was published by the Austrian Academy of Sciences: W. Gauss and E. Kiriatzi, Pottery Production and Supply at Bronze Age Kolonna, Aegina exemplifies the interdisciplinary approach to the study of technological landscapes adopted by the Laboratory team over the past decade. The School's Annual is now published by Cambridge University Press both in print and as a rolling e-publication, allowing subscribers to consult articles online before print publication and authors to publish a larger volume of illustrations also in colour. An important strand in the School's research in modem history and politics concerns the impact of the European Union in southeast Europe (Greece and the Balkans). In January 2011, we collaborated with the Hellenic Observatory of the London School of Economics in a conference organized by Kevin Featherstone on Changing Conceptions of 'Europe' in Modern Greece: Identities, Meanings, and Legitimation. Digging beneath the current crisis, and taking a long view of the definition and role of Europe in Greece, speakers examined shifting patterns of engagement with the European 'other' in the fields of foreign relations, cultural identity, politics,</page><page sequence="4">CATHERINE MORGAN economics and social institutions. The keynote lecture, on 'European challenges in a time of crisis', was given by former Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who reviewed options for reform of the euro-zone and new instruments to mitigate austerity. Professor Simitis's text can be viewed at: http://www2.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/ research/hellenicObservatory/Events/Conferences/BSA_c onference_2011/BSA_Conference_2011.aspx: the con ference proceedings will shortly be published as K. Featherstone (ed.), Europe in Modern Greek History (London). One of the contributors to these proceedings, Professor Thalia Dragonas (Athens), was the School's guest of honour for the London Open Meeting, delivering a lecture entitled 'Negotiating identities: reform of the education of Muslim minority children in Thrace'. The lecture provoked a particularly stimulating question session chaired by Dame Helen Wallace, Foreign Secretary of the British Academy. In April 2012, the School joined the École française d'Athènes in a workshop on The Balkans: From Academic Field to International Politics (recordings of which are available at http://www.bsa.ac.uk/pages/event_drill.php7events_itH65 7&amp;cat_id=106). This was the first act in a new collabo rative Balkan Futures programme, a co-venture between the BSA, the British Institute at Ankara and the École française d'Athènes, the progress of which can be followed on the BSA website. Research in literature has focused on Anglo-Hellenic relations and the link between writers and institutions. The 2011 Visiting Fellow, Roderick Beaton (KCL), pursued research on Lord Byron and the Politics of the Greek Revolution (1823-1824), examining Byron's actions in, and for, Greece during the last ten months of his life. Byron chose to come to Greece at a crucial point in the Revolution, when the country was torn by internal conflict and war against the Turks had paused. Given the crucial importance of these civil wars in determining the political complexion of the Greek Revolution, Professor Beaton's research focuses on Byron's contribution in helping to shape the future political system of the country as the first nation-state in modern Europe. Secondly, a conference in January 2012, entitled Between Two Worlds, organized by Peter Mackridge (Oxford) and David Ricks (KCL) in collaboration with the British Council and King's College London, focused on the role of the British Council in sustaining and promoting a mutual under standing, in Greece and in Britain, of the literary cultures of the two countries in the decade following the Second World War, examining also the cultural, political and ideological background to the Council's activities. Much of the School's work in the fine and applied arts relies upon the resources of the Archive, where attention continues to focus on the Byzantine Research Fund in preparation for two major exhibitions and a conference in 2012-2014. The first of these events, due to open on 5th December 2012, is an exhibition of the Thessaloniki photographic collection, organized in collaboration with the Centre for Byzantine Research of the Aristotle University and the Vaphopoulou Foundation to mark the centenary of the annexation of Thessaloniki to the Greek State. Ongoing work to make the Byzantine Research Fund accessible included preparation for digitization of the glass negative collection of Robert Weir Schultz and Sidney Barnsley (previously held in the Warburg Institute) and archival description of Schultz' notebooks and the Corporate Records of the Fund from 1907-1950. The papers of Peter Megaw were a particular focus, along with his slide library which contains rare colour images of (now lost) mosaics in Cyprus (Fig. 3) and from churches in Athens and Thessaloniki. Alongside this work, we continued to catalogue the glass negative collection of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies (Fig. 4). 3.

The first artist to use the studio was the 2010-2011 holder of the Prince of Wales Bursary for the Arts, sculptor Brigitte Jurack (Manchester Metropolitan). Exploring the relationship between the permanent object (sculpture) and non permanent performance (ritual) observed in her visits to ancient Greek sanctuaries, she created small-scale sculp tures of young people to be developed in porcelain. She also presented the School with two vessels now installed on the 'empty plinth' behind the Finlay Library. Her successor, sculptor Garan Davis, who makes large works primarily in bronze, used the Prince of Wales Bursary to create models for a new sculptural sequence. The School's research in archaeology is equally varied. In November 2011, we joined colleagues at the British Museum for a very popular study day on Knossos: From Labyrinth To Laboratory (recordings of which are available at http://www.bsa.ac.uk/pages/event_drill.php? events_id=593&amp;cat_id=106) and, in December, held a conference in Athens on Interpreting the Seventh Century BC: Tradition, Innovation and Meaning organized by former Fitch Laboratory Research Officer Xenia Charalambidou and the Director. The School now supports a number of artefact studies, notably a project led by Robin Barber (Edinburgh) to reappraise and publish fully finds in the National Museum from the excavation of Dawkins and Droop at Phylakopi. Large collaborative projects include the Fitch Laboratory's ongoing work to characterize pottery from the large deposit excavated at Methoni in 2003, which includes one of the richest collections of transport amphorae and inscriptions in Geometric and Archaic Greece (see now M. Bessios, Y. Tzifopoulos and A. Kotsonas, MEQQNH I: Emypatpéç, japáypaxa xai epnopiKá ovppoXa otr¡ rscopsTpiKr/ Kai ApyaÏKtj KepapiKij o.nó to 'Yttóysio ' [Thessaloniki 2012] http://ancdialects.greeklanguage. gr/ sites/default/files/studies/methoni_pierias_ 1 .pdf). The Fitch Laboratory is central to the School's collab orative activity, especially following its renovation and re equipment with new WD-XRF facilities. Four Fellows' projects illustrate the scope of Fitch research in areas other than its most familiar expertise, ceramic studies. The third Senior Visiting Fellow, Eva Panagiotakopoulou (Edinburgh), analysed insect remains from a section taken at the Neolithic lake settlement of Dispilio, in order to reconstruct environmental change and human impact (ID2760).2 Significant results came from the lower part of the section (where insect chitin is preserved) and in particular from the basal sample, which provides infor mation for the earliest, Middle Neolithic, occupation phase (a fragment of the preserved pine wood has been sent for AMS dating). Finds include fragments of reed beetles which frequent wetlands and reedbeds, typically around the edges of lakes or slow-flowing rivers, and four elytra of Sitophilus granarius, the grain or granary weevil, an important find not least for its early date. Sitophilus granarius is a flightless insect which relies on humans for its transport. Its origins probably lie in the Fertile Crescent, perhaps as an inquiline living in the grain stores of rodent nests, whence it moved to become primarily a pest of the stores and granaries of humans. Sitophilus granarius does not provide direct evidence for cultivation, since it does not infest plants in the field, but it does indicate the storage of cereals. It may have been intro duced to Dispilio by the first settlers. The earliest evidence of the beetle from the Mediterranean comes from a well at the submerged settlement of Atlit-Yam, dating around 5500 BC. From the Aegean, there is evidence from Early Cycladic deposits at Akrotiri and an imprint on a Neolithic pot from Servia (4700 BC): the early date of the Dispilio remains is thus significant. Dr Panagiotakopoulou continued research at Akrotiri into the use of insect remains to infer the date and season of the volcanic eruption (ID2761). Pithoi from room 5 in the West House contained fava beans infested by the pea and bean weevil Bruchus rufipes. A new AMS date from the chitin of the West House bruchids, obtained by Tom Higham (Oxford), suggests a midpoint of 1607 BC (within a range of 1744-1538 BC). The ecology of these beetles supports identification of the season of the volcanic eruption. Bruchus rufipes lay their eggs into bean pods in the field, whilst the pods are still green. This may occur in March, with adult beetles starting to emerge in late spring and early summer. In contrast with other genera of bruchids, Bruchus do not reproduce when beans are stored, but emergence may take place after harvest and storage. Since finds from Akrotiri include adults which have emerged, and several ready to emerge, the eruption must have occurred later in the year, and probably during the summer after the crop entered storage. Fitch Bursary holder Angelos Hadjikoumis' study of the large and well-defined faunal assemblage from the rescue excavation of an Early Helladic site at Koropi (ID2475), conducted in the 1980s by Olga Kakavogianni, is the first undertaken in Bronze Age Attica. Analysis of the 3,500 identified remains revealed a well-developed agropastoral economy, with a sophisticated knowledge of husbandry, and some signs of social and economic complexity. Sheep and goat were most abundant, exploited mainly for their meat, although cattle were at least as important due to their much larger body mass. Cattle were exploited until old age, perhaps for traction or milking. Pigs were also relatively abundant, contributing large quantities of meat: intensive (perhaps household and/or season-based) fattening was probably practised, with high mortality around 12 months. Breeding sows were kept beyond three years of age, while breeding boars were probably slaughtered before full adulthood when their behaviour may become erratic. Beyond typical uses of dogs for guarding and shepherding, frequent cutmarks on all parts of the skeleton (Fig. 5) indicate that they were systematically bred and consumed. Cynophagy was also practised in Neolithic Greece and it is interesting to trace its evolution in later periods. The single equid tooth discovered is insufficient to solve the problem of the date of the introduction of the horse or donkey into Attica, but it allows the possibility that this occurred during the Early Helladic. Less emphasis was placed on hunting - perhaps predictably, given the demanding nature of the agropas toral activities identified. Red and roe deer, hare and wild boar were present, although not fallow deer which may : ID references throughout AG refer to entries in AGOnline.</page><page sequence="6">CATHERINE MORGAN 5. Koropi: dog bones (humeri) bearing cutmarks, mainly to dismember the carcass. © A. Hadjikoumis. have been absent from Attica. Wolves and foxes were probably hunted to protect domestic species and for their fur, as well as meat. The manufacture of objects from bone, horn and antlers is well documented. Contextual study of the faunal assemblage also provides insights into social practices such as periodic communal meals and unusual occasions of meat consumption, with possible chronological differences within the Early Bronze Age. The study continues with examination of more Final Neolithic and Early Helladic contexts to distinguish functional and diachronic variation across the site. The School's Leventis Fellow, Evi Margaritis (Cambridge), pursued the study of well-stratified remains of olive and vine from excavations in the Cyclades, the northern Aegean, mainland Greece, Crete and Cyprus. Data obtained provide hitherto missing information for the early exploitation and cultivation of the vine and the olive in the Aegean Early Bronze Age, and support such related studies as residue analysis for olive oil and wine. Cultivation of fruit trees is evident from the gathering of fruit and from pruning. Olive and vine trees were initially managed for their branches and leaves - for fodder, fuel and building material. Pruning produced stronger and more numerous branches, which led to improved fruit production. In turn, this likely prompted exploitation of the growing quantity of fruit and the development of management strategies involving more intensive and careful pruning which transformed wild olives and vines into productive, cultivated trees. Microscopic study of the archaeobotanical data is enhanced by molecular analysis conducted in collaboration with the Department of Molecular Biology and the National Institute of Agricultural Botany at Cambridge University. Olive leaves and stones from very old and wild olives from Vouves, Margarites, Kavousi and Gortyn on Crete are currently undergoing DNA analysis to determine whether domesti cation was an indigenous development on Crete. These modem samples will be compared with archaeobotanical samples from Papadiokambos, Chryssi and Mochlos in east Crete. At Mochlos, analysis of Early and Late Bronze Age data also sheds light on differences and similarities in the varieties and origins of olives of these periods. Research into metal production in the Early Bronze Age Cyclades conducted by the Scientific Research Officer of the Fitch Laboratory, Myrto Georgakopoulou, focused on finds from recent excavations on Keros (ID2759). Although Keros appears devoid of ore resources, a small smelting site for both pure and arsenical copper was identified north of the Special Deposits on the Kavos promontory. Significant evidence for metal working and metal consumption was also recovered from all three settlement phases at Dhaskalio, mostly from the best-documented final phase. Frequent copper spills, tuyères and some metallurgical ceramics, probably from crucibles and moulds, indicate copper-working, and a litharge fragment suggests that cupellation was also practised. Excavated contexts date to the later Early Bronze Age, when tin-bronze was already known in the Cyclades, yet most copper-based artefacts at Keros were of arsenical copper, with very few tin-bronzes among the analysed finds. As at other contemporary sites in the southern Aegean, most copper artefacts are consistent with Cycladic sources, but the tin-bronze is incompatible with an Aegean provenance. The almost total absence of metal from the Special Deposits South and North suggests that despite the metal-rich character of the settlement, metal was not among the prestige artefacts deposited on Kavos. I conclude this account of the work of the School with a review of the most significant findings of the School's archaeological fieldwork, beginning at the Neolithic settlement of Koutroulou Magoula, a tell now under stood to be terraced on the north, east and south sides (ID2762). Excavation directed by Nina Kyparissi Apostolika (then Ephoreia of Paleoanthropology and Speleology for Southern Greece) and Yannis Hamilakis (Southampton) revealed the well-preserved walls of at least two new Middle Neolithic structures, with several open-air activity areas in between (Fig. 6). A corridor-like feature, belonging to a structure probably of the Bronze Age, indicates more extensive later activity than previ ously understood. One inhumation was revealed, raising the possibility of further burials nearby (Fig. 7). The large quantity of finds includes small objects such as clay balls and some 60 figurine fragments, plus two new fragments of terracotta house models, confirming that the site is unique in the Neolithic of Greece for its wealth of figurines. Other finds include chipped and polished stone, plus some 24 quern stones mostly found broken and clustered in an outdoor activity area. Preliminary indica tions are that most pottery dates to the second half of the Middle Neolithic period. Alongside the excavation, study of the 5,200 animal bones recorded in 2011, including worked fragments, enabled recognition of various patterns of differential treatment and deposition. Soil flotation samples were taken, soil micromorphology sampling continued and a pilot programme of organic residue analysis was conducted in preparation for the 2012 excavation season. At Lefkandi, excavation at Xeropolis under the direction of Irene Lemos (Oxford) clarified the history of the so-called megara and associated structures (ID2763). The successive Megara A and B were the main élite residences on site: research in 2011 focused on their origins and the earlier construction history of the area, and on their relationship to certain structures identified in previous years (see Fig. 32). Earlier walls under Megaron A formed part of an LHIIIC early house plan standard for the known multi-roomed houses on Xeropolis, which differ from the megara in orientation and plan. The walls had two construction phases equivalent to Lefkandi 1 a and lb, each associated with more than one phase of occupation. It is now clear that the construction of</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 Koutroulou Project K»y I 1 ChmWAih | 1 NMKIhte pMM 3 ( ] N»OWile er«H 4 n 8"*»*#• 6.

Megaron A began during Lefkandi phase 2a: a number of pictorial vases were found within it and in its newly discovered northeast room, at or below floor level. The complexity of the area around the hearth at the northern end of the megara underlines the significance of these buildings during the last stages of LHIIIC. The hearth had three main phases (Fig. 8). First, a low rectan gular platform was raised just above floor level. The floors of Megaron A then accumulated around it and began to cover it. In the second phase, soil heaped up along the earlier borders raised the hearth's sides and left a depression which was given a new base. The third phase saw the construction of a freestanding mud-brick hearth. Megaron A was shown to have a supplementary northeast room which contained a number of Lefkandi 7.

It was evidently used for food storage and processing, since several vases associated with these activities were found together with querns and hand-stones. The presence of a pictorial krater (Fig. 9) suggests the storage of vessels used for drinking and food consumption. Evidence of burning is also found in the north of the room. The room continued in use throughout the life of Megaron A, and the two structures were probably abandoned at the same time. The room's contents lay under the collapse of its mud-brick walls, but there is no certain evidence that the internal surfaces of the later Megaron B extended over the debris. Instead the area probably remained an open space while Megaron B was occupied.</page><page sequence="8">CATHERINE MORGAN 9. Lefkandi: pictorial krater from the northeast room. © BSA, I. Lemos. Full exposure of the so-called Annexe (an adjunct structure whose function and relation to the megara were previously unclear) also revealed a complex use history. The initial phase was connected to a substantial pebble surface. This first structure was replaced by a short, II shaped building open to the north: the ends of its west and east walls were probably marked by posts supporting the roof. A large pithos set into a pit indicates that the space was used for storage at least during this second phase. At some point in the life of Megaron A, the Annexe was enlarged by extending the side walls. An east-west corridor probably gave access to it and to the northeast room, as well as to Megaron A through its east wall. Another north-south access route, the passageway between the Annexe and the Megaron, gave direct access to these adjunct rooms from the south side of the megaron. The construction of Megaron B began in Lefkandi phase 2b/3. During the initial phase of use, the mud-brick hearth of Megaron A survived, repaired and slightly sunken into the floor: it is unclear whether it went out of use during the life of Megaron B. The north, east and south walls of the megaron were rebuilt on previous foundations, with the east wall considerably strengthened. The west wall, however, was moved further west and built in large, flat and squared limestone blocks, thus creating an imposing façade when approached along the east-west roadway from the west and central area of the settlement. Later use of the building into the Sub-Mycenaean and Early Protogeometric periods requires further study. One further episode may belong with the end of Megaron A or of Megaron B: two pits were filled with pottery and animal bones, probably after a single feasting event, and then closed off with piles of stones and pebbles. Identification of a substantial later structure confirms that the Annexe area was occupied after the period of the megara. While the existence of an internal space had previously been confirmed, no walls or associated surfaces had hitherto been recognized. A set of thin floors observed in the south baulk section was traced westwards, half-way along the south face of the megaron, and related to features including terracotta bins and a pit. Further study is required to determine whether this 'room' was initially associated with a late phase of the Megaron. Preliminary conclusions from ongoing zoo-archaeo logical analysis indicate that the inhabitants of prehistoric Lefkandi broadly favoured husbandry of domesticated species including caprines (which were the best repre sented, over cattle and pigs), with clear evidence also for some dogs and equids. This was almost to the exclusion of all other wild species, with the significant exception of red deer (and, to a much lesser degree, fallow deer), which were selectively hunted. The Pavlopetri Underwater Archaeological Project, directed by Elias Spondylis (Ephoreia of Maritime Antiquities) and Jon Henderson (Nottingham) completed a survey of the entire settlement area (ca. 8ha) using a stereo-photogrammetric Autonomous Underwater Vehicle deployed by a team from the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ID2548). A full photo-realistic record of the site was made, and the data are now being stitched together to build a complete 3D model of the submerged town. These very precise data, combined with finds lifted from the seabed, support site reconstructions made by the BBC for a BBC/Discovery Channel documentary entitled City Beneath the Waves (first screened in October 2011) (Figs 10, 11). In collaboration with the Hellenic Centre for Maritime Research (Dimitris Sakellariou), further océanographie and geomorphological work was carried out along the coast to explain when and how Pavlopetri was submerged. Three bands of beachrock, indicating the positions of old shorelines, were identified underwater and sampled (Fig. 12). Radiocarbon dates obtained show that Pavlopetri sank in at least three earthquake events, the first soon after 1000 BC and the others striking over the next 2,000 years, until the city was completely submerged by AD 1060. More samples have been submitted for radiocarbon dating to elucidate further the sequence of submergence. Limited excavation focused in an area between narrow walls immediately northwest of Building X, one of the best preserved structures on site, centrally located at the intersection of three streets. Building X differs from the Bronze Age domestic plans seen elsewhere at Pavlopetri and appears to be a strongly-built structure of specialized function. The narrow walls may indicate a corridor, or more likely a storage magazine adjacent to it, a hypothesis 10.

An in situ early Neopalatial pithos was excavated: similar in profile to examples from MMIIIB Kastri on Kythera, it was decorated with horizontal rows of stamped seals and finger-impressions, and sealed with a large schist slab. It was completely surrounded by grey marine sand and its base rested on firmer sand alongside fibrous organic material which was sampled for radiocarbon dating. 13.

A second smaller pithos lay close by to the southeast, and to the northwest a dark circular organic deposit may be the remains of a container, perhaps a basket or barrel, set alongside the other pithoi in this area. Such discoveries within one small trench support the hypothesis that the area was used for storage. The narrow long walls likely represent foundations: they are at the same level as the pithos mouths, making it likely that the pithoi were set into the ground. In the north comer of a room in Area L, lay the in situ remains of three separate pithoi with associated deposits (Fig. 14). The first bears decoration below the rim reminiscent of Neopalatial material from Kastri, while the second and third have rope impressed bands: all are likely similar in date to those near Building X. All of these pithoi therefore relate to buildings occupied in the Neopalatial period, and since both areas lie on the fringes of the settlement, it is possible that Pavlopetri was particularly extensive at that time, with lesser occupation continuing into the Mycenaean period as at Kastri. The discovery of complete miniature vessels at the close of the excavation in Area L implies that intact occupation deposits are preserved. The frequency of Minoanizing pottery among both excavation and surface finds confirms the close links between Pavlopetri and Kastri in Neopalatial times. Finds include Lustrous Decorated sherds and (to a significantly lesser extent) coarse red-silver micaceous wares. Lustrous Decorated is mainly represented by limited examples of polychrome painted jars or jugs. Most of the painted wares recovered in 2011 belong to vessels bearing monochrome decoration in black and in a few cases red. Plastic decoration is attested on storage and basin-like vessels of orange, red or grey micaceous fabrics. Minoan traits are also evident in the shapes of the excavated storage vessels, tripod cooking pots, a jug and the limited numbers of conical cups. Later finds include an Arabic gold dinar of the 10th—12th century AD. The last full study season of the Kythera Island Project took place in 2011 under the direction of Evangelia Kiriatzi (BSA: Director, Fitch Laboratory) and Cyprian Broodbank (UCL) (ID2673). A total of some 36,000 feature sherds of all periods have now been individually recorded from site collections and tract walking, permitting a near final overview of site numbers per period. In prehistory, scattered evidence for Late Neolithic (mainly lithics) is followed by sporadic light concentrations of Final Neolithic to Early Bronze Age I pottery. A much clearer settlement pattern is discerned in Early Bronze Age II, contemporary with, and followed by, a number of First Minoanizing scatters with an obvious coastal emphasis, although precise resolution for the late third to early second millennium BC (the First Minoanizing and First Palace periods) requires further study. The boom in the Second Palace period is one of the most remarkable phenomena in Aegean prehistory to have been detected through survey. Thereafter, tiny totals for the Postpalatial to Protogeometric and Geometric periods have been established, as also for the Archaic (although these figures may grow as diagnostics are refined). The Classical peak, the second highest in the island's pre 14. Pavlopetri: pithos removal looking west (scale lm).

Hellenistic and Early Roman site totals are again reduced, although those in the coastal zone will grow marginally once the problem of amphora chronology is resolved. Thereafter there is a significant climb through Middle to Late Roman (perhaps as the urban centre on Paliokastro dissolved). In the Early Byzantine period (mainly the late seventh to eighth century, with no proof of continuity to the Middle Byzantine) settlement levels are comparable with those at the end of the Bronze Age. Middle Byzantine figures are depressed by the difficulty of dating amphora types which extend into the Early Venetian period: once resolved, site numbers should reach the levels expected for an important period in the island's history, according to both written sources and church construction and painting. Venetian sites remain to be sub divided, and it will be important to see how the resulting patterns mesh with demography as known from censuses and with the emergence of the 'traditional' settlement pattern still evident today. As an indication of the huge amounts of pottery dispersed in the landscape over the past two centuries, substantial numbers of recent sherds are present at 121 sites, a minority of which have architectural investment in the form of field-houses or other such struc tures. Alongside this study, pétrographie and chemical analyses of pottery fabrics in the Fitch Laboratory have focused on the Roman pottery, and especially the cooking vessels used on Kythera. The Rnossos research centre houses a number of post excavation studies and the Curatorial Project, which continues to improve the storage and cataloguing of the Stratigraphical Museum collections and to provide training for museum studies interns. Work continues to integrate the museum records into the School's archival databases. Three field projects are currently active at Knossos: the Knossos Urban Landscape Project, the Gypsades Project (which this year conducted further geophysical survey) and the Kephala Project, which aims to recon struct the early stratigraphy of the Kephala Hill. In the</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 11 final part of this year's report, I focus on Kephala in tribute to John Evans, who died in July 2011. John Evans' extensive field projects included excavation for the BSA at the early farming site of Saliagos (with Colin Renfrew) and of Neolithic levels at Knossos in 1957-1960 and 1969-1970, work which forms the heart of the Kephala Project of which he was constantly supportive. In 2011, a season of survey and recording was directed by Peter Tomkins (Leuven), with two main objectives (ID2776). First, a representative sample of the visible walls across the Kephala Hill was surveyed using a total station and a differential GPS, in order to address inaccu racies in the present global architectural plan (S. Hood and W. Taylour, The Bronze Age Palace at Knossos [London 1981]) which had come to light during the construction of the Knossos Kephala GIS. Reducing these errors was essential to the main objectives of the project, to allow both accurate correlation of data from the 2009 geophysical survey (GPS located) and accurate positioning of the many tests and excavations conducted on the hill since 1900, the locations of which are typically recorded in relation to adjacent architecture. The second objective was to clarify the nature, extent and phasing of a specific group of masonry styles, characterized by the use of small-sized stones (both rubble and cut), within the Palace complex. Recent integration of excavated deposits and visible architecture by the project had seemed to indicate that such walls consistently pre-date MMI, with some possibly as early as EMU or even EMIB. Since these walls follow the same alignment as, and even in some cases comprise standing elements of, the present Palace, this seems to indicate that the history of the Palace complex stretches back well before the traditional MMI date for the emergence of the First Palace. In order to explore this hypothesis, a survey was made of the visible wall remains in the West Wing and along the South Front. Walls were characterized by architectural style and details of architectural phasing were observed. In addition, in the area south of the Central Court (Area of the Priest-King Fresco) an outcrop of bedrock was identified into which a series of early rubble walls was terraced (seemingly forming an early entrance north from the South Front to the Central Court) (Fig. 15). The identification of this outcrop further clarifies the topography of a natural knoll in this area, the existence of which had already been suggested by a recent GIS-based reconstruction of the natural topography of the Kephala Hill using existing test data assembled by the project. Celebration of the 125th anniversary of the British School in 2011 brought reflection upon our past and future. Promoting the wider understanding of Greek history and culture has been central to the School's work since its foundation. I therefore close this report by recalling how, in October 2011, we joined colleagues in the British Academy in marking the anniversary with a triptych of lectures, entitled Living Hellenism, delivered by Alexander Nehamas, Averil Cameron and Peter Mackridge, which reaffirmed the vital importance worldwide of Greek culture, thought and politics from antiquity to the present day. The enthusiastic reception of these lectures by large and varied audiences indicated - if indication were needed - their continuing appeal. That by Peter Mackridge was subsequenlty published in the January 2012 edition of the British Academy Review (http://www.britac.ac.uk/review/19/index.cfm). His reflections on 'The heritages of the modern Greeks' provide an important perspective on present troubles. \ mm I ***"■- ■ * t " ." ^ H km^Ki •g V IIS - * 15.

We may feel, or expect, as readers, that new reports supersede older ones. More often than not, these older reports retain their value, not as snapshots of early impressions, but as the first steps in a long line of progressive movements towards understanding. Some of the information that they contain is not repeated in subse quent updates. The Ministry book could not, and was not intended to be, a survey of even the most significant new sites, or new projects, within particular regions. Individual archaeologists and teams of archaeologists have made selections of data from within their own areas. This gives the book great variety. Some contributors have focused on very new material. Elsewhere the availability of annual regional publications has meant that specialists have not needed to showcase so much of their recent work. My report below is intended to give a flavour of what is becoming available in the online archive, and is based on the Ministry book, as well as project reports from the last 12 months. I will focus particularly on new information from the islands of the Aegean and from the Ionian Islands, as well as highlighting some of the significant developments in Athens (Fig. 16) and Attica. Contributors to other sections of AG give prominence to key develop ments in other regions. The increased importance of Roman, Late Roman and Medieval/Byzantine antiquities constitutes one the most prominent aspects of work in Greece during the last decade. Zosia Archibald School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool Notwithstanding the reduction in state archaeological funding, in the numbers of researchers operating in the region and in the scale of activity, the publication, by what is now the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports, of an online review of the fruits of Greek archaeology over the decade 2000-2010 provides a wealth of evidence testifying to the scope and scale of archaeological activity both before and after the 2004 Olympic Games, which, as other contributors to this volume emphasize, will continue to be a valuable resource for some years to come. Over the last decade, AG has provided readers with up-to-date information about recent archaeological activity, whether in the form of press notices, regular field reports, notices of online information or data gleaned from journals, such as Archaiologikon Deltion. New and estab lished scholars will find in these earlier reports a wide range of essential data about the sites and projects that are showcased in the Ministry's e-book (www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes). It repays to study these earlier texts, as well as the accumulating information in AGOnline, as of 2009 the principal source of data for archaeological activity in Greece.

A good section of the roadway east of the Stoa of Zeus has been exposed along with the krepis belonging to the stone fence around the Altar of the Twelve Gods (Fig. 17), contrasting with the rutted and worn surface of the Panathenaic Way. At Makriyanni, excavations by the 3rd EPCA uncovered a further section of the ancient Palladion court, first investigated by John Travlos in the 1960s in the area between Makri and Athanasiou Diakou Streets. The discovery of the southern part of the court gives a more complete picture of the building, which seems to have taken the form of a stoa. Finds included clay ballot boxes and a bronze voting ballot, as well as coins of the fourth century BC (ID2470). Along the Panathenaic Way (ID2471), recent rescue excavations by the 1st EPCA in the bed of the Athens-Piraeus railway have prompted re-examination of the interpretation of a row of square stone sockets designed to hold upright wooden posts which lies across the line of the roadway. The five post-holes were origi nally interpreted as part of the simple starting-line (hysplex) of an early racetrack, of the sort known from Priene and Didyma. New excavation here now shows that they form part of a temporary roped-off enclosure (perischoinisma) and cannot be part of a starting line. Three sides of this enclosure are defined: the fourth, to the east, has not been found. An area of fill at the extreme east end of the section was therefore excavated to determine the full east-west dimension. A sequence of seven hard packed gravel road surfaces was excavated, dating from the Early Hellenistic (third century) to the Early Roman period (first century BC to first century AD). The post holes, originally dated to the late fifth century BC, lie somewhat lower down and should be exposed next season. The road surfaces to the west were also examined. A series of several hard-packed level surfaces had suggested in the past that the road may have been used as a race track. Four surfaces above the fifth-century BC levels date from the first to the fourth century BC (unpublished field report, ASCSA). J. Stroszeck (DAI) reports on the 2011 season (ID2472) at Kerameikos. As part of a project to examine water management in ancient Athens, an underground J 17.

Other cisterns have been found in the Kerameikos in private houses, workshops and in a sanctuary in the area of the bath-house in front of the Dipylon. This 28.3m-long tank (Fig. 18), consists of three bell-shaped cisterns connected by two corridors. The walls are made of a ring of stacked blocks of coarse grained, porous yellow limestone. The bottoms of the cisterns are cut into the soft marl bedrock. The cistern floors each had a round, basin-shaped depression in the centre, where silt could settle. The entire system is lined with a hydraulic mortar. Communicating passages, which considerably increase the cisterns' capacity, improve the flow of air and water between the chambers, give access for cleaning and occur in other tanks in Athens and Piraeus.

At the transition to cistern 16 is a plastered separation wall. The construction of the cistern is connected to the reconstruction of the baths after 403 BC. The storage capacity of the system was drastically reduced in the second century BC, when cistern 15 and passage 2 were filled in (cisterns 16 and 17 remained in use): at the transition from passage 2 to cistern 16, a separation wall prevented the water from draining in this direction (Fig. 20). The cisterns were later converted into ground-water wells by digging through the silt basins. Finally, cisterns 16 and 17 went out of use due to the Sullan destruction of the whole area (unpublished field report, DAI). In the Plaka area, the lstEPCA has continued to inves tigate areas in and around the Library of Hadrian (ID2478). This includes a Roman to Late Roman bath complex, thought to be associated with Hadrian's Gymnasium, part of which was discovered in 1949 by the ASCSA east of the Stoa of Attalos. At a property at the junction of 80 Adrianou Street and 3 Diogenous Street, a Justinianic gate of the Late Roman walls was revealed, plus part of a rectangular tower and of the walls, as well as the remains of the post-Byzantine church of Panagia Krystalliotissa. Under the Venizelon mansion at 96 Adrianou Street, part of the Late Roman fortifications was revealed (Fig. 21), while in the courtyard of 5 Dioskouron Street lay part of the retaining wall of the ancient Street of the Tripods to a height of five courses (Fig. 22). In the basement of the Aiolos (the first hotel in Athens, built in 1837) at the junction of Aiolou and Dexippou, the southeast corner of the Library of Hadrian came to light, as well as part of a large square tower or gate of the Late Roman walls of the city. Many architec tural members and inscribed bases of various periods were recovered. At 4 Shelly Street, successive layers of the Street of the Tripods were excavated along with its fourth-century BC retaining wall and the foundations of two choregic monuments. At 16 Thrasyllou Street, part of the foundation of the Odeon of Pericles was revealed: the foundation was set on a terrace and the pottery from the foundation trench dates to the first half of the fifth century BC. Excavation at 2 Vyronos Street, to the south of the ancient Street of the Tripods, revealed the whole width of the street (5.9m) and its western retaining wall of conglom erate blocks (ID2478). Various water and drainage systems, mainly clay pipes, were sunk into the road, the date of which extends to the Byzantine period. Excavations continue, focused on the area beyond the eastern boundary of the ancient road where the road probably turned west towards the Theatre of Dionysos, with another route continuing to Dionysiou Areopagitou Street. In a trial trench at 6 Bakchou Street, part of a Classical choregic monument was uncovered, along with further layers of the ancient Street of the Tripods leading towards the Theatre of Dionysos. The range of investigative activities in Piraeus has developed apace and only a brief indication will have to suffice here. M. Petritaki (26th EPCA) reports that part of a tower (4.35m long and 2.4—2.45m wide) of the north arm of the Long Walls was uncovered in the garden of a property on Periaios Street (ID2448). Six courses of the tower corre spond with the initial construction, while a seventh was a later Roman alteration. North of the tower were the remains of the outer road of the north arm of the Long Walls which linked the city of Athens with Piraeus (Fig. 23).</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 15 &amp;&gt;• %:i * -r r t ^ ■ --v.

At 22 Akti Koumoundourou Street (Moutsatsou property), M. Petritaki (26th EPCA) reports the excavation of parts of four shipsheds at the harbour of Mounichia (ID2440). The complete widths of three were preserved, while the fourth was almost destroyed to the west of the property. The structure consists of a continuous wall oriented east-west, parallel with the sea, and four parallel series of cubic bases (or their substructures) for the colon nades which supported pitched wooden roofs. Between these colonnades was a sloping krepidoma build of stone slabs, which should extend a few metres into the sea to launch ships' keels into the water. Within the boundaries of the plot, the shipsheds are 21.8m long at most; the column bases are around 5.3m apart. From a section of a column found nearby, the inter columnar space is estimated at ca. 5.45m. Since the average width of a trireme was around 5.56m, these shipsheds are a little narrow, raising questions about the type of ships housed. The shipsheds were built in the fourth century BC and remained in use until the Roman period, probably being destroyed by Sulla. At Moutsopoulou Street (OSK property), M. Petritaki (26th EPCA) reports the discovery at Zea harbour of a pair of shipsherds (one complete and a small part of a second) which formed the continuation of the shipsheds discovered by M. Dragatsi in 1885-1886 (ID2441). From two preserved column bases, their width is estimated at 5.1m (Fig. 24). ■* h» :' r 22.

Phokis At Kirrha, Phokis, systematic excavation continued in 2011 in the area opened up since 2009, under the direction of D. Skorda (10th EPCA) and J. Zurbach (EfA). In Sector 1, new trenches were opened in 2011 to connect up with those investigated in 2009, in the area west of the ceramic kiln discovered by the Ephoreia in 1989 (ID2646). The new areas revealed a number of walls, belonging to several houses, some with multiple rooms, as well as a pit containing animal bones. The contents of a LHI pithos were preserved in a collapsed state in situ. Four child burials were also found in this sector. In Sectors 2 and 3 the trenches opened in 2009 were resumed in 2011. Two cist tombs and eight pit graves were found belonging to the latest phase, phase A. Four phases were identified in all, of which phase D contained particularly well preserved residential features, comprising two rectangular structures, orientated east-west. Boeotia The Eastern Boeotia Archaeological Project continued investigation of Eleon, directed by B. Burke, B. Burns and S. Lupack (Canadian Institute at Athens) (ID2628). Geophysical prospecting by G. Tsokas allowed three locations to be selected for preliminary excavation. In the northwest, two Late Bronze Age phases have been identified, belonging to LHI and LHIIIA. In the southwest, numerous figurines, animal bones, metal finds and pottery have been found, belonging to LHIIIC, including jugs, bowls and pithoi. The earliest evidence belongs to LHIIIB2. The third trench encompasses a polygonal stone wall. Aegean islands At Palaiopolis on Andros, the University of Athens continues excavations (ID2622). The southern area of the agora continues to be the main focus of investigation, particularly the southwestern end of the southern wall belonging to a structure fronted with a propylaion and containing a peristyle court (dating to the end of the third and beginning of the second century BC). Part of the architrave belonging to the propylaion of this Hellenistic structure was re-used in the Proto-Byzantine period: this successor building was also investigated in 2011. The agora also had a lower terrace, where the same team has investigated the southern wall of a sixth-century AD chapel, which was built immediately over a krepis of the Hellenistic phase of this public space, preserved to a height of 1,07m. Remains of the Proto-Byzantine basilica contain re-used architectural fragments of the Hellenistic portico. The excavation of this area is focusing on the church that succeeded the sixth-century chapel, principally the nave and the area of the north wall, where numerous architectural fragments, as well as a drain associated with a fountain, together with further re-used fragments of Hellenistic date, and one inscription, have been identified. Excavation at Strophilas (ID2690) continued in 2011 under the direction of Ch. Televantou, north of the prehis toric settlement and along the external rampart, as far as the eastern gateway. Numerous graffiti were revealed in this sector, representing ships, as isolated images or in groups. East of the gateway, a figure, human or a xoanon, with rectangular features, can be distinguished. Pottery sherds belong to the Final Neolithic; a bronze fibula, stone tools, including quem stones, obsidian flakes and marble implements of exceptional quality were recovered. Northeast of the settlement, and close to the sanctuary, Building B was explored. The external dimensions are 12.5 x 13.5m, and it was divided into three rooms. One of these, at the western end, was large, with two smaller chambers on the east. The red, compacted-clay floor was finely smoothed and well preserved in the southeastern comer. The structure was supported on wooden posts and a stone pillar. At Hephaistia, on Lemnos, the Italian School continued in 2011 its investigation of the 'Lazaridis' building, in the central part of the isthmus (ID2623). The construction, which dates from the early sixth century BC, contains four rectangular rooms, the whole construction being oriented northeast-southwest. This was destroyed in the early years of the fifth century and the remains sealed below subsequent structures. The north wall of Room 3 has produced well-dated deposits, sealed by a wall dating to the fifth century, which was succeeded by another wall of the second century BC. Among the finds belonging to the Archaic, destroyed structure, were sherds of imported Attic cups, locally made, one-handled cups, local and Attic oinochoae, as well as transport amphorae, especially from Chios, and Attic amphorae 'à la brosse'. The Italian team also worked in the Mavrolambadou plot, where the 'house of the columns' dating to the seventh century AD was found to have origins in the fifth. These levels overlie Late Archaic activity. A sondage also revealed Bronze Age strata (ID2626). In the Samian Heraion, investigations, by W.D. Niemeier on behalf of the DAI, of the oldest levels yet discovered at this site continued. In 2009 a new trench was opened in the northeast area of the sanctuary, north of the Sacred Way (ID1296). Below the four EBAII levels, a Late Chalcolithic deposit was discovered, immediately overlying the pebbled surface of the beach. This site, along with the other Chalcolithic activity on the island, identified at Tigani, in the estuary of the Imbrasos river, is contemporary with Emporio VII-VI, Liman Tepe VII, Bakla Tepe and Miletos I. Although the structures identified from this early stage are relatively ephemeral (traces of posts and branches from roofs, overlying a slab floor), there is evidence of orthogonal two-roomed domestic structures from EBAI (ca. 3200-2750 BC) and the beginning of EBAII (ca. 2750-2500 BC). This settlement grew on the southwestern</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 17 side during EBAII (ca. 2550 BC), towards the location of the later Temple of Hera. New sondages conducted in the area of old trenches here brought to light evidence of phases I to V belonging to the prehistoric phase of the Heraion, which is contemporary with the final stages of EBAII and the beginnings of EBAIII of the island's Bronze Age (ca. 2550-2000 BC). Two phases of the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1800 BC) have been identified. In the earlier phase, a house wall was destroyed by the Imbrasos river, while in the later phase a bank was built to keep the waters of the river at bay. Locally-made ceramics resemble Anatolian wares, including Liman Tepe III, Milet III and Beycesultan V-IV. Pottery was imported from Miletos, Crete and the Cyclades, reflecting the commercial networks to which this community located northeast of the later Heraion belonged. East of the Rhoikos altar, a new trench has revealed votive offerings in the fill underlying the altar. Below this fill there were two bucrania on a pavement of river pebbles. The votives include limestone statuettes (among the Cypriot pieces), bone, Egyptian faience, pomegranates, peacock heads in ivory and clay, an astra galos of amber and a miniature column with an animal frieze sculpted below the channelling of the capital. A miniature cauldron, signed by the artist Poses, discovered in 2010, was originally placed on top of the column. N. Kourou (Athens) continued to investigate terraces AA and D (grid squares K9,19,110) at Xobourgo, Tenos, east of the 'Pre-Cyclopean sanctuary' (ID2633). An Archaic construction was revealed, made of carefully made masonry blocks. In the sector above the 'Pre Cyclopean sanctuary', on terrace E (where a public building has been identified: ID2068), a masonry staircase, leading up the Archaic rampart, has been exposed. A road paved with schist slabs, which is flanked by two retaining walls (t.XLVI and t.XLVII), leads to this stairway. The stairway in turn provided access to Building D on terrace D. Investigation of the retaining wall of terrace E2 produced Geometric and Classical pottery, including relief-decorated pithoi, all nevertheless contam inated by Medieval sherds, indicating disturbance of the earlier levels in the later period. Cyclades Excavations on Syros at the acropolis of Chalandriani (Kastri hill) continued under the direction of M. Marthari (Director Emérita 21st EPCA) (ID2689), in the northern sector of the fortified reserve. Sherds of LBAII pottery and obsidian blades were recovered. Re-examination of ceramics from the excavations of Ch. Tsountas (AE [1899] 78-134), which remain unpublished, indicate that the type of jug with narrow neck and the ovoid pithos with relief decoration were the commonest forms on the acropolis (Ergon 58 [2011] 32). On Delos, the aim of the 2011 season conducted by the EfA (following initial work in 2010) was to study the northern section of the Roman fortification built by the legate Caius Valerius Triarius in 69BC, known hitherto as the Mur de Triarius (ID2641). The construction has double faces, the central cavity filled with blocks of gneiss, 2.5m thick, resting on the ground, without a foundation course. Earlier structures were destroyed before this construction commenced. A large destruction area between the lake and the 'Maison du lac' was revealed. Four inscribed blocks that refer to the rampart, two of which constituted dedica tions built into the wall, were also studied. A. Vlachopoulos (ASA) has commenced study of prehistoric remains on Astypalaia, following in the footsteps of Ch. Doumas (ID2691). Traces of Bronze Age structures were identified below Hellenistic ones on a small promontory above Vathy bay. Surface survey has revealed Bronze Age and Hellenistic ceramics, as well as stone tools, flint and obsidian flakes. Ionian islands The decennial report of the Ephoreias responsible for the Ionian islands has produced a wealth of new information about sites of all periods. Roman and Byzantine sites are reported in the 'Roman Greece' and 'Byzantine Greece' sections below. Among the prehistoric sites that deserve to be singled out, there is Marathia, Ithaca (ID2596), where Palaeolithic and Mesolithic stone tools have been recovered. Final Neolithic and Early Helladic traces have been found at Arginia (ID2589) and EHII-III remains at Yayana (ID1608), and there is Neolithic evidence at Mousata, all on Kephallonia (ID2588). There are Early Helladic and Bronze Age remains at Skala Mounda (ID2590), and at the multi-period settlement at Tzannata a Late Bronze Age site is now being investigated, comple menting the well-known Mycenaean tholos tomb (Fig. 25; ID2710). A períbolos wall was among the latest features identified on this site, built ca. 1200 BC. 25.

A cobbled road leading to the harbour has been revealed (Fig. 26; ID2602) and another from the city to its cemetery.

In front of the adyton was found a monolithic limestone base supporting a wooden column which has now been lost. The adyton was interpreted by the excavators as the location of the oracle. Further to the east an eschara was found, surrounded by a substantial deposit of ashes together with bone and obeloi. The character of this deposit suggests that the area was used for ritual dining. Before the final destruction of Temple 7 ca. 580 BC, the structure suffered an earlier destruction, possibly by earthquake, dateable to the second half of the seventh century BC. The northern mud-brick wall, which fell into the temple, was plastered and decorated with wall paintings. Thanks to meticulous excavation, this discovery provides rare evidence of wall-painting from an early period and can be compared to the finds at Isthmia. Equally exciting is the reconstruction of what was found from the surviving fragments: a representation of two opposing groups of hoplites such as those depicted on the renowned Chigi vase dated to ca. 640 BC (ID167: fig. 2). Underneath Temple 7, lies Temple 6, dating from the Middle to Late Geometric period. It was also built of mud-bricks on a stone foundation, ca. 800 BC. Since its western end is covered by the foundation of the Archaic Temple 8, it is not clear whether it was apsidal or rectan gular. At the western end, the limestone base of the cult image and a burnt wooden plank which had fallen in front of it were found. This amazing discovery has been inter preted by Niemeier as the xoanon. When it was decided to replace the small Temple 6 by the much larger Temple 7, Temple 6 was ritually buried, accompanied by the deposition of rich metal offerings, similar to the way in which the provisional sanctuary built after Temple 7 was abandoned. The deposit included iron Naue Il-type swords (13), spearheads (five), obeloi, personal ornaments, such as necklaces, pins, fibulae and rings, and figurines. Notable among them is the discovery of a bronze bowl of north Syrian origin, depicting a circle of men holding hands, possibly dancing (ID798: fig. 2). These finds were burnt, perhaps in a deliberate fire. The earlier Temple 5 (ninth century BC) and Temple 4 (tenth century BC) were built in the same technique but oriented in the opposite direction, with their apsidal ends to the east and their entrances to the west. Protogeometric pottery similar to that from the Toumba builing at Lefkandi dates the use of Temple 4 to the middle of the tenth century BC. Irene S. Lemos Merton College, University of Oxford Euboea and central Greece have been the focus of a number of excavations and surveys carried out in the last decade and these have contributed to a much better under standing of the archaeological material of the period. It is thus useful to summarize some of the main projects under taken in the region. In central Greece important excavations allow us to consolidate evidence from the major sanctuary at Kalapodi. This is indeed one of the most important sites excavated in Greece within the last decade. It is located in a fertile and strategic location between Lokris and Elis, not far from the coastal sites along the Euboean gulf. Recent research at the site by W.-D. Niemeier and his team suggests that the sanctuary was in fact that of the renowned oracle of Apollo at Abai, and not that of Apollo and Artemis of Hyampolis, as had previously been argued (Felsch [1987]; AR 53 [2006-2007] 41; ID435). Since 2003 Niemeier and his team have focused on the South Temple where an exceptional sequence of eight temples from the Mycenaean to the Archaic period has been excavated (Fig. 28). In addition, a small Classical building, probably the successor of the adyton of Temple 7, was also revealed, along with a provisional sanctuary in the same area. The Archaic South Temple 8 was destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC. It has now been established that this temple was built around 570-560 BC. The temple had both wooden and stone columns; the latter were in the east side colonnade and perhaps in the north. The temple had ramps on both its west and east sides. The limestone west pediment was found lying as it had fallen. It has not yet been turned over, so we do not know whether it was decorated or not. However, terracotta fragments from the seima and the central acroterion (a horse protome) were also found where they fell (for the reconstruction of the west façade, see ID798). The Persian destruction was evinced in a spectacular way, especially in the area of the north peristasis, where among the debris the iron parts of eight cross-bar wheels belonging to carts have been found. These, together with horse trappings and Corinthian helmets, were votives which were most probably suspended from the columns of the temple (AR 51 [2004-2005] 55-56; ID167, ID168, ID435, ID798, ID1031, ID2072). The predecessor of the Archaic South Temple was that of the Late Geometric to Early Archaic period (Temple 7). After its final destruction around 580 BC, a provisional sanctuary was constructed on its ruins. This was an open temenos in which the adyton of Temple 7 (see below), was transformed into a freestanding building. A Doric capital found inside it had been re-used as the altar. It is one of the earliest known Doric capitals, well-stratified with a terminus ante quem of ca. 580 BC. Before the construction of Temple 8, the provisional sanctuary was ritually buried: numerous votives (rings, fibulae and a shield of bronze, as well as iron spearheads, obeloi and knifes) were deposited on the floor and burnt in a sacrificial fire. Judging from pottery found under its earliest floor, the apsidal Temple 7, which was built with mud-bricks on a stone foundation, was constructed towards the end of the eighth century BC. At the western end stood a small n 28. Kalapodi: temple phases. © W.-D. Niemeier.</page><page sequence="20">20 IRENE S. LEMOS Recent discoveries in 2011 and 2012 established without doubt the existence of a further three earlier temples. Temple 3 is characterized by the rich LHIIIC finds, which include examples of pictorial pottery but also a wide range of open vessels (such as cups, kylikes and kraters), indicating participation in ritual consumption of food and drink (Fig. 29) (ID167: fig. 3; ID798: fig. 3). The cult character of the deposit is further supported by the discovery of a bovine figurine with wheelmade body, while the presence at the sanctuary of élite members is suggested by the discovery of some exceptional seals; among them a lentoid seal of the Island Sanctuaries Group in veined limestone with the depiction of two bulls. In Temple 2, dated to LHIIIB, important discoveries made in 2012 revealed a horseshoe-shaped altar (similar to that found in building Gamma of the Cult Centre at Mycenae). On it were found the fragments of a large figurine, and next to it was a platform where the jaw of a sheep or goat was found in situ. In Temple 1, dated to LHIIIA1—2, were discovered the predecessors of both the altar and the platform for animal offerings of Temple 2. Interestingly, after the destruction of Temple 1, some 24 lentoid seals of steatite, fluorite and glass were deposited on the ruins, probably as a foundation offering for the erection of Temple 2. The discovery of Middle Helladic pottery together with an exceptional Midde Minoan seal found in the lowest levels further suggest that Kalapodi was a sanctuary even during this period (ID167: fig. 4). The recent excavations at Kalapodi provide new evidence suggesting continuity of cult at the sanctuary from at least the Mycenaean period if not earlier. Indeed, cult there might even have been initiated in the Middle Helladic period and, if this was the case, further discov eries will provide much needed evidence for cult practices for this particular period. In any case, any earlier doubts about the existence of cult in the palatial period have now faded with these discoveries, clearly indicating the cult character of the site by the LHIIIA period. W.-D. Niemeier suggests that, because the sanctuary is only 20km from Orchomenos, it might have been under the control of this particular palace (Niemeier [2008] 303-04). At the same time, however, rich chamber tombs dated to this period - such as those at Kalapodi Kokkalia and Zeli (Dakoronia and Dimaki [1998]; [2004]; Livieratou [2009]) - could indicate that the sanctuary had associa tions with even closer communities. This might indeed be the reason why the sanctuary was not abandoned after the collapse of the palatial system. On the contrary, the LHIIIC period was a busy phase when the sanctuary might have served as a middle ground, not only for the local neighbouring communities but also for others along the Euboean gulf. It is crucial to find out what kind of changes took place in cult practices and in the running of the sanctuary after the end of the palatial period now that we know that the sanctuary was already active in the Mycenaean period, if not earlier. Such clarification will contribute not only to the understanding of this unique diachronic site but also of the agents responsible for its enduring history. Some progress has already been made in earlier and recent studies, and from current discoveries which assess the character of the sanctuary from LHIIIC to the Geometric period. It has been argued that during LHIIIC the focus of the rituals was consumption of both food and HBlllB 29. Kalapodi: Krater found in situ. © W.-D. Niemeier. drink. This picture emerges from the finds studied so far - mostly ceramics - and suggests that storage, preparation and consumption of food and drink form the main archae ological evidence in this post-palatial period. On the other hand, it has been argued that from the Early to the Late Geometric period the decrease or even disappearance of cooking wares and the increase in metal finds suggest a change in the behaviour of worshippers and thus the artic ulation of cult. This is further supported by another change traced from LHIIIC to Geometric, when the quantity of unincinerated bone fell, while the amount of calcined bone increased (Felsch [1987] 5; [2007] 552; Kaiser et al. [2011]). These changes also coincided with an increase in metal finds, notably the appearance of obeloi, which were used for roasting meat. So though the appetites of the worshippers may have changed, what remains interestingly consistent - as noted by Niemeier - is the continuous presence of military display and achievement (ID167). Such display is visible at Kalapodi from at least the LHIIIC period, when scenes with warriors are popular themes for the decoration of kraters. Later in the Early Iron Age, when metal votives increased, weapons are numerous, indicating that their display was important for those visiting the sanctuary. The amazing wall-paintings of the Late Geometric to Early Archaic temple clearly celebrated another important development in military history, which was promoted not only on contemporary pottery and in poetry, but also in a cult context, judging by the finds at Kalapodi. Finally, the discovery of parts of carts, horse trappings and helmets, which were most probably suspended from the columns of the Archaic South Temple, further underlines the impor tance of celebrating military achievement at the sanctuary. Another important aspect of Kalapodi is the impli cation by Niemeier that the sanctuary was that of the renowned oracle of Apollo at Abai. If this is indeed the case, then the question is: when was the oracle estab lished? Surely such a function of the sanctuary did not go back to its Mycenaean past - or did it? During LHIIIC Kalapodi was in close contact with the coastal sites of Pyrgos/Kynos and Mitrou, and through them with the rest of the Aegean. A recent study of ceramic assemblages from Kalapodi, Kynos and Mitrou has also successfully shown the links and the differences between these sites from the LHIIIC to the end of the Early Iron Age (Rutter [2007]). Establishing contacts through ceramic studies is important as they can reveal common cultural</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 21 ties and shared traditions. For example, one study has shown that, during the LHIIIC period, Kalapodi might have been the site of the workshop producing large sized pithoi decorated with impressed patterns (Lis and Rückl [2011]). Another study has suggested that when, during the Middle and Late Geometric periods, at other sanctuaries (for example at Isthmia) proto-kotyles and kotyles replaced cups and skyphoi for communal drinking and eating, at Kalapodi the worshippers once again favoured cups (Kaiser et al. [2011]). The site of Pyrgos/Kynos, located near the modern town of Livanates, has been excavated from 1985 to 1995 by F. Dakoronia. The ongoing study of the excavations has resulted in the publication of a number of reports on the long period of occupation of the site, which was inhabited from the Early Helladic to the Byzantine period (Dakoronia [2003]; [2006]; [2007]). The LHIIIC occupation of Kynos is still visible today. The study of the stratigraphy of the site together with ceramic analyses have shown that the LHIIIC period had Early, Middle and Late phases, which, according to the excavator, have been marked by two destructions caused by earthquakes. First, the site was destroyed by fire at the time when LHIIIC Middle pottery was in use. Soon after that event, it was levelled and rebuilt. The second destruction was at the end of LHIIIC Late, after which Kynos was reoccupied but with modest structures. Interestingly, in the same period there was a revival of the rite of burying children in cist tombs in the floors of the houses (Dakoronia [2006]; Dakoronia and Kounouklas [2009]). At present it seems that LHIIIC was a flourishing period at Kynos. The excavated structures had storerooms and workshops including kilns for pottery and metals. One pottery workshop specialized in the production of pictorial pottery of the LHIIIC Middle period: a number of the finds are kraters depicting warriors on ships, a combi nation which was not common in the iconography of the Mycenaean period. These kraters are one of the most renowned finds at this site and have been discussed exten sively by the excavator and others (Dakoronia [2007]; Crouwel [2006]). The ongoing study of the material and the publication of the stratigraphy and architecture of the site will provide significant information from another important site in the Euboean gulf which was clearly very successful in the LHIIIC period. Yet another important site, a few kilometres to the north of Kynos, is Mitrou. It lies on the north Euboean gulf near the modern town of Tragana. The site, now on an islet, was in antiquity most probably on the mainland. A survey that took place before the launch of the excava tions recorded pottery from the Neolithic to the Late Roman periods (Kramer-Hajos and O'Neill [2008]). The excavations, conducted from 2004 to 2008 under the direction of A. Van de Moortel and E. Zahou, have shown Mitrou to be a key site in the Euboean gulf. The complex stratigraphy of the site, which the excavators have tackled with great efficiency, revealed that Mitrou offers signif icant evidence for the rise of complex society in the early Late Bronze Age as well as for the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age (Fig. 30). The early history of the site is also informative, showing that Mitrou was important during the Early Helladic and the Middle Helladic periods. Indeed, the Early Helladic settlement at Mitrou covered at least the entire northern half of the islet, as did the Middle Helladic settlement. Within the Middle Helladic period, seven stratigraphically-based ceramic sub-phases have been identified and linked to the ceramic chronology of Pefkakia in Thessaly. The discovery of the remains of a wooden boat dated to the Early MHII phase is exceptional. The wood had disintegrated, but the boat survived as a black stain in the ground in the shape of the hull. In the preliminary report (ID45), it has been estimated that the full length of the vessel was 5.5-6m, meaning it was a small fishing and/or transport boat. Excavations were for the most part focused in the northeastern sector of the islet and revealed a sequence of buildings. Among the earliest structures discovered was an architectural complex dated to LHI (Building D). During the second phase of its use, from LHI to LHIIB, a large rectangular funerary structure (13.5 x 8.35m) was built over its northwestern comer, partly on the top of earlier walls. Within this enclosure was a rectangular built chamber tomb (5 x2 m) with a dromos to the west, which had a porch fronting onto a pebbled street (Road 1). Although the tomb was looted, ceramics found left in it are dated to LHI. Also belonging to this phase of the tomb are four pieces of a boar's tusk helmet, two arrowheads, an amber bead and small gold and silver nails. East of the tomb and within the funerary enclosure, a rectangular platform made of stones was found, but its use has not yet been determined. It is possible that the enclosure was dedicated to funerary rites. The rooms of Building D excavated east of the funerary enclosure were rebuilt and used during the same period, but it is not yet clear whether for funerary or other purposes. In the LHIIB phase, the chamber tomb was enlarged to 7 x 2m and the dromos relaid. The walls of the funerary enclosure were enlarged to a thickness of up to 1.2m. Some of the grave goods Pl! m ■ 11 30. Mitrou: excavations. © ASCSA.</page><page sequence="22">22 IRENE S. LEMOS retrieved include Mycenaean vases, as well as six more pieces of a boar's tusk helmet together with an arrowhead and gold and bronze jewellery. Adjacent to Building D and elsewhere, parts of four orthogonal roads have been uncovered. Roads 1 and 2, bordering Building D to the west and north respectively, were 3m wide and carefully paved with pebbles. Road 3, likewise pebbled, bordered a second architectural complex discovered in the northwest excavation sector. This complex, Building H, had less impressive architecture but contained a significant amount of imported pottery, as well as a piece of horse bridle which would have been imported from the Balkans. After widespread destruction in LHIIIA2 Early, very little architectural activity took place in the excavated areas, although the presence of LHIIIA2 Middle to LHIIIB2 Late pottery indicates that the settlement was not abandoned. In the LHIIIC Middle phase, a new rectan gular structure, Building B, was erected on top of the funerary enclosure of Building D. It was built with quite sturdy walls (0.7-0.8m thick), but its use is unknown because it was much disturbed by later activity. By LHIIIC Late, Building B had gone out of use and flimsy structures arose on top of and to the south of it (Buildings J and G). Around the end of the Early Protogeometric phase, apsidal Building A was erected inside the southern room of Building B. In the Late Protogeometric phase, this apsidal building was replaced by rectangular Building E which was erected at the southwestern end. Building E's use ended in the Late Protogeometric period. This continuous occupation of superimposed and prominent buildings has suggested to the excavators that there was a conscious effort to live in the same space as during the Late Bronze Age (Van de Moortel [2009]). The discovery of the early Late Bronze Age chamber tomb, and the fact that its dromos remained open until early in the LHIIIC phase, supports the idea that there was some sort of communal memory associated with the ancestors who were buried at this location. Another interesting aspect at Mitrou is the discovery of many intramural burials. Some of them are dated to the EHIII, Middle Helladic and LHI periods, but most belong to the LHIIIC and Protogeometric periods. So far some 75 individuals, buried mostly in cist and pits tombs, are under study. A large number of these individuals are children, but adults were also buried here. The excavators report (Van de Moortel and Zachou [2011] 335-36) that the LHIIIC and Protogeometric graves are clustered in groups and are often found within the ruins of earlier buildings. They also note, however, that with the exception of a child's grave (which might have been disturbed), no burials were found inside Building B. Most graves were located at least 3m away from Building B, with the exception of four Protogeometric cist graves which were placed near the south side of Buildings B and A. Two of the graves are long and built of conglomerate; they belonged to adults, while two smaller graves contained children. Their size, construction, and proximity to Buildings B and A suggest that they are the graves of a prominent group, most probably members of the local élite. Most of the other graves are, in general, not rich in offerings, but there are exceptions. For example, the Early Protogeometric grave of a child found north of Building B contained bronze fibulae and vases, including a tripod of clay, while another infant buried in the Late Protogeometric phase was given a faience necklace. Of particular interest, and related perhaps to funerary rites, was a small rectangular structure, Building C, which was constructed on top of the northwestern corner of Building B after that building went out of use. It is dated to the LHIIIC Late period and its character was not domestic - some 26 handmade miniature vases, as well as a cooking pot with piglet bones, found there were used for special occasions. So Building C was perhaps somehow associated with the burials found in the surrounding area. This diachronic use of the site has allowed the excavators to observe and comment on the changes that Mitrou underwent during its long occupation. It is also notable that while early reports concluded that the impor tance of the LHIIIA2 Middle to LHIIIB period was not significant, the combination of new finds, such as the dating of many of the pebbled surfaces of Road 1, the identification of dozens of LHIIIA-B figurine fragments and the discovery of a dump of high-quality LHIIIB2 Late pottery with ceramic roof tiles, now suggests that the importance of the palatial period has been underestimated. The excavators also emphasize (Van de Moortel and Zachou [2011] 333) an important change in the character of the settlement from LHIIIC Middle to LHIIIC Late. They believe that from LHI to LHIIIC Middle the settlement had an urban character, evinced in the occupation of well-built rectangular structures lining well maintained orthogonal roads. On the other hand, by LHIIIC Late the settlement had reverted to a more rural appearance with flimsy structures, external courtyards and poorly-maintained public spaces. The ongoing research and study of the finds at Mitrou will further enhance our knowledge of a key site in the Euboean gulf; the careful excavations, conducted with up to-date methods, offer much which will increase our understanding of the region from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age. Evidence from the sites discussed above suggests that their prosperity during the post-palatial and Early Iron Age was dependant on their strategic location along the Euboean gulf and on their connection with similar sites which also flourished after the palatial collapse (Lemos [1998]; [1999]; [2002] 212-217; Crielaard [2006]). One of the most important sites in the region is Lefkandi on Euboea. The site was founded at least in the Early Bronze Age - if not earlier - and was important in the Middle Helladic period. At present, the LHIIIB period is not well repre sented, but this might change with future research (Sherratt [2006] 304). In any case, Lefkandi was a prosperous LHIIIC site and it became especially prosperous in the LHIIIC Middle period after destruction at the end of LHIIIC Early. The old excavations and trial trenches together with my excavations, suggest that the entire hill was probably occupied in this period (Evely [2006]). The current size of Xeropolis at Lefkandi and its surrounding area is around 8-9ha. If we take into consid eration the dramatic erosion of the tell - especially in the south - we can deduce that there was a large settlement occupying the tell during this period. Indeed, Xeropolis might have been one of the larger settlements in the central Aegean. Recent research suggests that Xeropolis was between two harbours. One of the interdisciplinary projects undertaken during the recent excavations investi gated the depositional history of the tell on its northeastern side. In a series of trenches dug there, a uniform grey silt deposit was found, suggesting that the sea once formed a</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 23 more extensive lagoon in this area. It is also possible that there was a similar lagoon to the northwest of Xeropolis - and if this was the case, then the palaeo-geography suggests an isthmus. So the tell was between two harbours with an isthmus which provided access to the mainland (Davidson et al. [2010]) (Fig. 31). During the LHIIIC, Xeropolis was a well-organized settlement with large houses - some with a second storey - divided by alleys. These houses were well equipped with storage facilities, and their inhabitants used a variety of well-made ceramics. The recent excavations on Xeropolis have uncovered a large building in the eastern part of the site and in close proximity to its eastern harbour. This building, because of its size and architec tural plan, has been named the 'Megaron' (Fig. 32). The date of its construction is in the middle of the LHIIIC and it had several phases of use. But what is of most signifi cance is that the building was occupied during both the LHIIIC Late and the Sub-Mycenean period, while its last phase of use was at the beginning of the Early Iron Age. The building had, during its first phase of use, one additional room used mostly for storage and the prepa ration of food, while in another room - the 'Annexe' - where we have evidence of some cult practice linked perhaps with the foundation of the second phase of the 'Megaron'. Later this room was also used for storage. REGION I REGION I ^_EX.GOUN*R|S 2008 31. Xeropolis: plan of the site. © BSA, I. Lemos. vlife r* r,.; m * • - , 4®BJf •«* . ' :StK» Ji • .

LEMOS In the middle of Xeropolis further information has been revealed with the discovery of a wall - perhaps even a double wall. The wall extends from east to west some 35m or more and continues further to the east into an area which has not been investigated yet. The date of the primary use of the wall is within the LHIIIC period and its construction involved complex design and deliberate landscaping which marked the approach to the settlement. This is close to a 'ritual' area located to the west, where a number of structures have been excavated whose character can be considered neither domestic nor funerary. The earliest is once again dated to the LHIIIC Early and the latest to the transitional stage from the Sub Mycenean to the Protogeometric period, at the end of the 11th century (ID446, ID803, ID525, ID1696, ID2763; Lemos 2010). So Xeropolis provides some interesting observations. First, although it is impossible to estimate the precise size of the settlement during this period, it would not be wrong to suggest that the layout of the houses, divided from each other with alleys and yards, and the extensive character of the settlement implies some sort of proto-urban organi zation. Such a statement might be supported by the discoveries in the middle of the tell and close to its main approach, which indicate that rituals were taking place and strengthening the bonds of the community. Moreover, during LHIIIC Middle a large building was constructed at the eastern end of the tell with a long architectural plan set on a different orientation from both earlier and contem porary structures. Both orientation and plan marked, in my view, a clear change in the architectural traditions of the tell. Moreover, I would like to suggest that such a change might have signified a transformation of social order on the hill. Whether the so-called 'Megaron' was the seat of the local leader is not yet clear, since we have not excavated the whole of the tell; thus we do not know whether other similar buildings were constructed on the tell. But whether they were or not, someone must have been in charge to keep in order a large site, to organize the completion of buildings, to keep in good repair the wall or walls and, finally, to oversee the organization of the communal rites and feasts. Success at Lefkandi depended on good organization of local resources and the advantageous location of the site on the Euboean gulf. Xeropolis, with its double harbours, controlled the approach to the most difficult part of any journey up the gulf: the passage through the narrow Euripus strait. Local knowledge is essential to cross safely the strong tidal currents with their reverse flow. In addition, the site's long history of occupation relied on its proximity to the most fertile plain on the island, the Lelantine plain. The preliminary study of the bio-archaeological remains, which have been systematically retrieved by A. Livarda and G. Kotzamani, has shown the presence of a wide variety of plant species. These include different types of wheat, both glume and free-threshing varieties, hulled barley, millet, lentil, vetch, fig, grape, olive and numerous wild species. According to the specialists, the picture which emerges is that of a socio-economic organi zation which supported a broad agricultural strategy engaging in the cultivation of different species of cereal and legume crops, as well as Suits, herbs and various wild floral plants. The ongoing study of the recent excavations has revealed structures and floors dated from the LHIIIC to the abandonment of the site around 700 BC. These include structures dated not only in the transitional stages from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, but also some Sub-Protogeometric and Late Geometric buildings. Finally another welcome discovery at Lefkandi is that of two Late Geometric burials found in the area of the eastern harbour. Such evidence was lacking in the past, since the rich cemeteries in the area of the Toumba hill ended around 825 BC. Both these burials are of children. Ceramics associated with them are datable in the LGI and LGII phases, showing interesting and close links with the ceramics produced in Eretria. It is indeed in Eretria that an important discovery was made by A. Psalti near the agora and within the area of the eastern cemetery of the site. The remains of pyres dated to the MGII period were found together with a rich deposit of ceramics broken in its ash layer. It has been suggested that these ceramics were among the offerings given to a cremation burial, though no bones were found. The excavator, however, convincingly argues (Psalti [2011]) that the bones might have been retrieved after cremation and placed in an urn which has not yet been discovered. Among the pots was an exceptional krater decorated with horses mating in the handle zone, while in another, smaller panel two figures are depicted probably engaged in a sexual act. Psalti suggests that they are a man and a youth, and places the scenes on this unique vase in the context of the symposium which, together with horses, was enjoyed by the élite residents of Euboea. The discoveries at Eretria together with a plethora of major publications by the dynamic Swiss team have further advanced the study of Iron Age Euboea. Meticulous studies on burial rites, ceramics and other important discoveries, such as the detailed publication of the open-air sanctuary, have advanced the study of both the site and the region (Huber [2003]; Blandin [2007]; Verdan et al. [2008]). Two major exhibitions organized by the Swiss School of Archaeology have advertized the plethora of excavations and finds by Greek and Swiss archaeologists working in Eretria. The first was held in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens in 2010, the second in the Antikenmuseum Basel and Sammlung Ludwig in 2010-2011. The two catalogues - respectively Epézpia, panéç as pía ap/aía Tzó/.r¡ and Cité sous terre: Des archéologues suisses explorent la cité grecque d'Erétrie (in both French and German editions) - are laudable publications for all interested in this site. Yet both rescue and systematic excavations at the site have not been able to show that Eretria was a significant settlement in the LHIIIC and the Protogeometric periods. For this reason, the excavations at Amarynthos by the Swiss School are very welcome, with the discovery of levels with LHIIIC sherds and also some Protogeometric/Sub-Protogeometric tombs (Blandin [2008]; [2011]). Also welcome is the launch of excavations at Karystos by the Dutch Institute at Athens and the Greek Archaeological Service. Initial reports from the excava tions at Plakari, now underway and conducted by A. Karapaschalidou (Director Emérita, 11th EPCA) and J.-P. Crielaard, indicate that a sanctuary of regional - and perhaps even supra-regional - importance was located on the site. Ceramics found there include vases from central</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011 -2012 25 Euboea, Attica and the Cyclades. The earliest pottery so far recorded is Early Iron Age. In another sector of the excavation a Classical Hestiatorion was discovered (Crielaard [2011]). More important finds are expected to turn up at Karystos, a site whose imposing position must have been an advantage from an early period (Figs 33-35). Finally, returning to the mainland, a survey has been conducted by the Eastern Boeotia Archaeological Project directed by B. Burke, B. Bums and S. Lupack of the Canadian Institute and V. Aravantinos (Director Emeritus, 9th EPCA). The survey concentrated around the area of Tanagra. One of the aims was to locate and record the Mycenaean tombs where the renowned lamakes were found. The largest concentration of Mycenaean chamber tombs was around Eleon. Here, trial trenches excavated in 2011 unearthed buildings with finds dated to the LHIIIC period (among them were figurines, ceramics and metal objects). The excavators note that the pottery is similar to that found on Xeropolis. Here again the continuation of the excavations will provide interesting results regarding the post-palatial period of a region which had such an important Mycenaean past (http://web.uvic.ca/~bburke/EBAP/). To conclude, this region offers important material for the period examined in this report. The excavations at key sites and the publication of their results will enable us to follow the accomplishments that the region enjoyed after the palatial collapse and the processes which endorsed the formation of city-states by the Archaic period. 33.

Principal among these projects in the city itself were the works ahead of the construction of the New Acropolis Museum and for the extension of the metro system. Both have now appeared in preliminary publications in the Archaiologikon Deltion (now up-to-date for the excava tions of 2004), while the metro was the subject of an exhibition and catalogue by the Goulandris Foundation. No excavations in the city have ever been conducted on such a scale: the museum plot at Makriyanni investigated an area of around 10,000m2 and the metro works nearly 80,000m2. As a result, our understanding of the city's urban fabric, its road and water systems, cemeteries, sanctuaries and fortifications has rapidly expanded from the Neolithic through to the early modern period; full publication of these sites is eagerly awaited. This year, the Athens section of AR takes a tour of what can now been seen of the results of such excavations around Athens: archaeological areas which have been left open and prepared for public display, and the small collec tions of finds included in the halls of a number of metro stations. Construction of the New Acropolis Museum within a plot in Makriyanni, to the south of the Sanctuary of Dionysos, necessitated major excavations in part of the city known to be densely occupied in many periods up to the Late Byzantine. The principal works took place between 1997 and 2005 (see AR 52 [2005-2006] 8; ID1705, ID2116), although several sections of the plot had previously been investigated, particularly on the north side, beneath the Weiler Building and in the 2,500m2 area to the east, excavated for the Acropolis metro station. There was scarcely a year since 1980 when trowel did not break ground here (see ADelt 54 [1999] 45 for a history of investigations in the area). Following the excavations, the design of the museum was altered so as to disturb the antiquities beneath as little as possible, partly by raising the structure on high concrete pillars, while much of the remaining archaeology was prepared for public display through open areas outside of the building and within through glass panels in the floor. An exhibition about the excavations is planned for the future. Occupation on this site has been traced back to the Early Helladic, while many burials were discovered from the Middle Helladic through to the Protogeometric period. From the eighth century BC, the area became predomi nantly residential, with several Classical houses, Hellenistic workshops and much relaying of roads and building extensions in Roman times. During the fourth to sixth century AD the plot housed imposing villas, bath complexes and workshops. Following its abandonment in the seventh century, the road network which crosses the site was not rebuilt, and during the Middle Byzantine era the area included a cemetery of vaulted tombs. The excavated area is divided by a series of roads into building blocks. Entering the plot from the pedestrianized Dionysiou Areopagitou, the first section of excavations visible shows the Roman West Baths, bounded to the west by Road II and to the south by the smaller Road IV, in use from the third century BC to the fourth century AD and now only partially preserved beneath the circular hall of the later Building E. The bath complex comprises frigi darium, caldarium, tepidarium and praefurnium, and has an open courtyard with a well. Following a period of abandonment, the complex was repaired in the fourth to fifth century, probably becoming a house with frescoed walls and imitation marble revetments. A large room to the east paved with marble mosaic appears to have been destroyed at the end of the fifth century. Road II, dating from the end of the fifth century BC, runs along the whole length of the west side of the visible remains, and is best seen from the gardens at the side of the museum. The block to its east provides the principal display through the open floor of the museum's covered entrance, with the remains of two large Roman houses in the southern half. Houses T and Ex, partly covered by the more prominent Building E at the north. House T, occupying the southeast comer of the block, is a Late Roman/Early Byzantine dwelling with a central peristyle court, the floor paved in opus sectile of diamond shaped marble plaques, best seen from the garden at the west. As preserved today, the form of the house dates to the fifth century AD, being then abandoned towards the end of the sixth century. Further east, House Ex is less well preserved. It is on a higher level than House T and built around a colonnaded courtyard with clay tiled floor. The north part of the house comprises a series of small rooms, clustered around a large central triclinium. The house is also Late Roman/Early Byzantine, but may have been laid out by the Roman Imperial if not the Late Hellenistic period. Access to the house was via a narrow corridor leading out to Road I. The principal structure visible through the viewing platform over the northern section of this block is the Early Byzantine Building E, most readily identifiable by the large circular hall at the far north of the block. The complex consists of a large central apsidal hall (25 x 9.5m), with series of rooms to the south and east, while access from the north was by six preserved steps which lead into a small chamber with entrances to the apsidal hall and the circular hall (7m diameter). Between the apsidal and the circular halls is a small triconch hall, perhaps a dining area. Coins of Heraclius (AD 610-641) and Constans II (AD 641-668) in the foundation trenches of the apsidal hall give a terminus post quern of the seventh century. During the eighth and ninth centuries, sections of the structure were used as a ceramic workshop, and by the tenth century further hydraulic installations and a kiln indicate industrial activity. Road I, dating back to the late fifth century BC and abandoned at the end of the third century AD, serves as the southern boundary of this building block, and continues to run east-west across the Makryianni plot into the metro excavations. It is best viewed from the gardens to the west of the museum, where its intersection with Road II is clearly visible. From this point, as well as through glass panels in the floor of the southwest corner of the museum's ground floor, can be seen the Classical House 0, founded at the end of the fifth century BC and containing a well preserved andron with a mosaic floor of marble and pebbles in separated panels. The house remained in use</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 29 over a long period and underwent many repairs and alter ations. In the Hellenistic period, a workshop was estab lished in the courtyard with a system of three connecting rectangular tanks, arranged on different levels. A pipe drained water into an underground cistern, while the unclean or surplus water was removed to Road II through a built drainage channel. The workshop was probably a fullery or washery of some form. In the second century AD the house was extended towards the east. Its rooms were arranged around an interior courtyard with a floor of marble gravel. Final destruction came at the end of the third century. To the south of the Weiler Building - a military hospital and barracks built in 1836 - is the small Central Baths with frigidarium, tepidarium, unctorium and caldarium. It operated from the end of the fifth century AD and reached its final form in the seventh century with the addition of rooms to the south, including a sudatorium. The eastern part of the Makriyanni plot was excavated in 1993-1996 for the construction of the Acropolis metro station. A reconstructed cross-section of Road I is on display in the station's lower hall, dating back to the fifth century BC, as evidenced by a carefully constructed terra cotta water conduit set within a rock channel. A total of 16 road surfaces date from the second half of the fourth century - associated probably with the rebuilding of the Theatre of Dionysos around 330 BC - down to its abandonment in the seventh century AD. A number of cases display pottery from the Middle Helladic, Mycenaean and Protogeometric cemeteries in the area. The exhibition continues with various household objects: lamps, toys, cooking equipment, loomweights and amphorae. North of the Arch of Hadrian, along Amalias Avenue, a sheltered section of the excavations for a metro shaft has been preserved adjacent to the Zappeion Gardens. A large bath complex dates from the late third to early fourth century, after the Herulian invasion, including caldarium, tepidarium and frigidarium. The structure was enlarged in the fifth to sixth centuries with four paved pools, one of them subterranean with a vaulted roof and on its walls graffiti of birds, crosses, fish and human figures from a later date, when the place was a refuge or martyrium. In Byzantine times nine built clay storage pithoi were sunk into the bath and 29 silos for grain. One oblong interior has a floor supported by 17 re-used marble grave columns as hypocausts, some of them inscribed. In a tunnel near the shaft at a depth of 20m, wells were uncovered with abundant pottery; a number of late second to early first-century BC wine amphorae are now in the exhibition space of the Syntagma metro, along with finds from the metro excavations beneath the square. Several exhibition cases display inscribed funerary kioniskoi and stelae, mosaics and a Late Hellenistic/Early Roman beehive. A long cross-section of the excavation is recon structed here, including a section of the Peisistratid aqueduct dating from the first half of the fifth century BC, 70m of which was found during the excavations. A branch is also on display in an open area at the eastern side of Syntagma Square, the pipes in a deep channel carved into the schist bedrock, painted with black bands, sealed together with lead and with openings for cleaning (ID2177). The system here seems to date to the first half of the fifth century BC, a later branch of the original later sixth-century network found in the Irodou Attikou shaft within the National Gardens and in the Evangelismos metro excavations. In the park outside Evangelismos, a section of the aqueduct has been preserved, with some pipes on display in the metro foyer, with painted letters of the late sixth century. The aqueduct here runs east-west from the Ilissos springs on Mount Hymettos along a main road, which leads from the Diochares Gate in the Themistoklean wall to the Mesogeia, outside the eastern limits of the Lyceum complex on Rigillis Street. The display in the park includes a large fourth-century grave enclosure and a number of Roman marble sarcophagi. Other exhibits in the foyer include Classical marble funerary vessels, and a reconstruction of a first-century BC to first-century AD pottery kiln which was founded after the enclosure went out of use, when the area housed several pottery workshops. A small exhibition in the Panepistimio metro displays finds from the excavations for the station and a shaft on Amerikis, principally from graves of the fifth century BC to the fourth century AD. Works to pedestrianize Aiolos Street and Kotzia Square have included a programme of display of the probable Acharnai Gate and the Acharnai road (ID 2198, ID2208). Beneath the National Bank building and on Aiolou Street a stretch of the city fortification included the wall, its inner circuit road, the proteichisma, the ditch with its retaining walls and the outer circuit road. An ancient road with preserved wheel-ruts crosses the peripheral road of the circuit wall, and is identified as the road leading to Acharnai, a long stretch of which can be seen in nearby Kotzia Square. The Acharnai road was laid out around 480 BC and remained in use until the third century AD, when pottery workshops were built in the area after the Herulian invasion. Six hundred and eighty graves were excavated here, dating from the ninth century BC to the third century AD. This area also went out of use after the sack. During the fourth century AD over 30 pottery kilns were in use across the area. An impressive vaulted section of the Eridanos river has been left in situ within the Monastiraki metro station. In the Late Classical period the river was bounded on both sides by conglomerate blocks and paths, and in Hadrianic times was roofed with a brick vault, covered with earth and transformed into a sewer. The building complex in Kerameikos housing the Islamic art collections of the Benaki Museum displays in its basement an impressive section of the ancient city wall of the fourth century BC, with additions during the reign of Valerian. Along the corridors of the Aegaleo metro station is a series of displays from the excavations of the Profitis Daniel and the Spyrou Patsi shafts, which uncovered a section of the Sacred Way and its associated cemeteries.

Examples might include Roman investment in a Greek city (which can be seen in the provision of a gymnasium by Hadrian to the Athenians with which a recently excavated bath complex in Plaka may be associated [ID2478] or the dedication of the Temple of Hermes at Sybrita, Crete, by Titus Flavius, on which see ID2855) to local investment to attract Roman attention (such as investment in Imperial Cult). The fact that this can change over time is well illus trated by the find of an honorific imperial statue at Cleonai whose accompanying inscription seems to have been erased in an act of possible damnatio memoriae, according to the excavators K. Kissas (Director 37th EPCA) and T. Mattern (Trier/DAI) (ID2409) (Fig. 36). Rebecca Sweetman School of Classics, University of St Andrews To date, much of the debate concerning the relationship between Rome and the provinces of the Empire has focused on ideas of cultural exchange. Recent trends have concen trated more on the mechanisms and practicalities of such, particularly in terms of networks (see, for example, the Tracing Networks Project: http://www.tracingnetworks.ac. uk/content/web/introduction.jsp; the Roman Port Networks Project: http://www.romanportnetworks.org/; and the Entrepôt and Storage Project http://www. entrepots anr.fr/). In contemporary scholarship, the network society is based around sharing of information and communication (Castells [1996]; Van Dijk [2005]). Cities or areas may be the nodes or hubs through which various lines of communi cation may run, but it is, of course, individuals who mediate these. The success of an area is often directly related to the number of communication links it has. In terms of individuals, those who can mediate between different groups of people (local élites, traders or even craftspeople) often appear to be most successful. The network society is not static and the roles that places and people play within it can change over time, in part due to fluctuations in elements like demand for and availability of goods and services. The application of network theory to the analysis of Rome and the provinces enables a more holistic perception of the past without diluting the manifold roles of different provinces, areas and people. It allows for diversity within individual parts of the network depending on their function within the whole. In terms of the Roman Empire, development of places and areas may in part depend on their importance to the Roman network, as well as to the aspirations of a community or certain parts of a community. Networks are not simply the trajectories along which people travel, communicate, exchange ideas and undertake trade. The concept can also be applied to represent elements of decision making and choice on the part of individuals, communities and government. The operation of a social network may also be reflected in choices relating to cultural elements, such as the design of houses and interior décor, burial practices and religion. While some areas or groups may strive to be part of a network and others may be coerced into it, studies of networks enable a contextualized understanding of why there was investment in a particular location, by whom, whether it was a success or a failure. The sorts of networks that have been identified throughout the Roman Empire include trade and economic routes; religious commitments and innovations; social webs and patronage of people and places. An understanding of networks can play a significant part in identifying the roles of areas or provinces within the Empire over time (for a range of examples, see Malkin et al. [2009]; for Crete, see Sweetman [forthcoming]). This brief synopsis of the provinces of Roman Greece focuses on the kind of evidence that may reveal the roles that different areas played within Roman networks. I will explore the role of networks by examining evidence for investment and evidence of various long-term practices (domestic and mortuary data). With this in mind, different provinces will be contrasted and others will be presented in more detail, as the 2011 material has filled in some significant gaps in terms of understanding the provinces of Greece.

Application of network society theory enables analysis of the evidence as much in terms of the local contribution to being part of the Roman Empire as Rome's desires to maintain areas and provinces. Criticisms of the study of the Roman Empire have emphasized issues of focus (a very Rome-centred view of the provinces). However, is it not always easy to identify who undertook the devel opment of certain areas (local or Imperial), particularly after the foundation of the Greek provinces. In saying that, the striking number of Roman harbours that have been investigated and reported in 2011 is indicative of the important roles that Greece played in the Roman network society. This was not always the case, as the evidence of the recent study of the shipsheds at Pireaus shows that they were still in use during the Roman period but they may have possibly been destroyed during the Sullan sack of Athens (ID2440). At Anemomylos on Corfu, a mole from the Alkinoos harbour was investigated and it became clear that the harbour was re-used and remodelled in the Roman period after a temporary abandonment of the area (ID2609) (Fig. 37). At Mavra Litharia in the Gulf of Corinth, excavations revealed harbour moles dating to the late second or the first half of the third century (ID2498) (Fig. 38). This may be connected with the third-century reconstruction of the theatre at Aigeria, and, if all of this happened in the third century, this is interesting in terms of investment at a time when life begins to be a little unsettled in the Empire under Maximinus Thrax. The natural geographical uplift meant that the team excavated the harbour on dry land. It is interesting that the harbour</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 31 37.

As the evidence of the Achaean, Cretan and Epiriot harbours indicate, rather than seeing Rome imposing change, it is possible to see that diverse areas within provinces underwent development at different rates and times which were in part dependent on their roles or aspirations within the Roman network. It is clear even from the 2011 material that the Greek provinces had a range of different roles in the Empire, as trade facilitators (for example Crete and Delos), suppliers of products and skills (for example Chania and Vathy) and as destinations for cultural experi ences and development (Sparta and Athens). While some of the evidence for manufacturing indicates local or even home industries, some, such as the murex-production workshops, indicate use for export. Nikopolis has three known harbours, and work at one of them, Vathy, has revealed a Roman and Late Antique murex-production workshop (ID2530). A second murex processing area has been excavated at Metaxaki Street, Chania (Kydonia 196-201). In Achaea and Epirus, a new installation with finds of glass and sandstone was revealed at Agios Konstantinos (John Kennedy Street), Agrinion (Aitolia) and dated to the Late Roman or Late Antique period (ID2379). A similarly dated workshop was found at Kainourio with a wine vat and press and storage pithoi (ID2382) (Fig. 39). At Petrina, Arcadia, a second- to fourth-century Roman workshop with water and drainage has been investigated (ID2431). It is not always easy to define overall functions on the basis of rescue data, but when these sites are plotted in their topographic and archaeological context, it is possible to apply network theory to help understand the role of the area concerned in the Roman period. The evidence of another industrial space at Agrinion, Agiovasiliotika, has revealed extensive remains of two workshops, one with a Hellenistic to Roman and possibly Late Antique potter's kiln, another kiln of uncertain date and a Late Roman or Byzantine agricultural installation (ID2358) (Fig. 40). The presence of the agricultural processing areas is to be expected, given the rich agricultural land that surrounds the area, and the focus of the workshops in the north of modem Agrinion helps to locate the Roman city in this area. 39.

This also applies to areas within the province too. It seems that Crete played a key role as an entrepôt for Roman trade networks from the late first century onwards, and it is likely that this was reflected in the development of the northern ports and the diversity between areas of the island. It is clear that the southern part of Crete, which was used already by Roman traders, changed much more rapidly when the island was included in the Empire than most areas of the northern part of the island (Sweetman [2010]). It is suggested that the northern part of the island saw much more focused development from the late first century, nearly 100 years after the foundation of the province (Sweetman [2007]), and the rescue excavations along the coast, particularly around Rethymnon, support this assessment. For example, at Chamalevri the extensive remains were very well preserved and, although the first phase of occupation appears to have been in the second to third century with a second one in the fourth/fifth century, there are earlier finds on site (ID2828) (Fig. 41). An oil press and potter's kiln of this industrial quarter were identified, and it is notable that, although amphorae were produced in the kiln, there was still evidence for imported amphorae as well as lamps on site. The long-term use of this area is comple mented by recent evidence at the coast at sites such as Stavromenos (bath-house) and Sphakaki (ID2803) (a well-embellished seaside residence). Further evidence for industrial activity in the northern half of the island comes from Argyroupolis, (ID2772) where a two-roomed glass workshop was brought to light, and at Kyani Akti (Aptera) (ID1870) an industrial installation was also investigated. At Chania a potter's workshop with kilns and kiln furniture was found at Skalidi and Manoussoyannakidou Streets (ID2852). Such finds help to illustrate the levels of self-sufficiency on the island, while its export of wine and murex (from Kouphonisi and now Chania) indicate the ability to generate a reasonable income. The role as a trade facilitator surely would have allowed access to luxury items which were not regularly available. The research agenda at the provincial capital, Gortyn, has primarily been on the public centre of the city which was swiftly developed as a Roman civic centre. Recent holistic overviews (ID2829, with individual area reports as ID2820) have noted a great deal of continuation in the public core from the early Imperial investment until after the AD 365 earthquake. The civic focus has more recently been diversified with work reported in 2011. For example, rescue excavations in the nearby village of Kastelli (ID2814) have provided evidence of a Roman rural villa which will in due course provide some invaluable evidence concerning the occupation of the hinterland of Gortyn. Rural Crete It is becoming clear that Crete was a significant province in the Roman network society, which is not surprising given its crucial location in the Mediterranean. While its roles in Mediterranean trade networks of the first and second centuries can be well assessed, it has been less easy to see what was happening to the island in the third and fourth centuries. As Sanders postulated in 1982, it is likely that there was a much greater emphasis on agriculture, and this makes sense in the broader context of the somewhat unsettled times of the third century. While extensive and important work has been undertaken on the farmstead on Gavdos (AR 47 [2000-2001] 141), elsewhere on Crete such facilities are primarily identified through survey data, as at, for example Galatas (ID266) and Vrokastro (Elleniko) (Hayden [2004] 274). Now, as the 2011 material shows, increasing evidence for extensive agricul tural complexes, particularly from the third century, is filling the gap, with the examples of the third- to sixth century agricultural villa at Maroulas (Rethymnon) (ID2791) and the multi-phase farmstead at Phounardos (ID2796). The Late Antique occupation of the island has also been enhanced with the excavation of the agricultural establishment at Vryses, where five rooms containing storage areas and a workshop have been investigated (ID2808) (Fig. 42). 41.

Provincial comparisons Comparisons between areas within Crete can be under stood in terms of the chronological developments of different parts of the island according to their changing roles within the networks of the Roman period. The islands too can be compared. Even with all the recent work on Roman Greece, the Cyclades are still an under studied resource. By contrast, in the Ionian islands, evidence of significant development is already apparent.</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 33 The Cycladic and Ionian islands Study of the Cycladic islands in the Roman period is at a preliminary stage, even though islands such as Amorgos and Milos have extensive Roman remains. Material from 2011 includes the workshop and villa excavated at Minoa on Amorgos and two dwellings in Klima on Milos. On going studies of shipwrecks (for example that in the Livadia Bay of Tilos) will enhance this work (ID2693). Much more is known about those like Delos where less extensive Bronze Age remains have not distracted scholars from study of later periods. Fundamental to the study of networks is the study of storage, and the ANR (l'Agence Nationale de la Recherche) sponsored project Entrepôts et lieux de stockage du monde gréco-romain antique (http://www.entrepots-anr.fr/) is already changing the way we understand the role of islands like Delos in the Roman economic network. At Delos, a major spatial analysis of key areas (such as the theatre district and stadium area) on the island has been undertaken (ID2636). The survey has identified areas of storage in domestic and commercial space and has also shown the extensive use of rooms as storage within a range of buildings along the coast of the agora area. A study of the shops also revealed cavities in the walls which would have helped make the most of the space available and increase storage capacities. The roles of the Cycladic islands in the Roman period were diverse: even those that had little Imperial investment would have played a role in the network, albeit a passive one. According to the sources, many of the islands were used as places of exile with punishment increasing in accordance with their remoteness. In contrast to the Cycladic islands, the Ionian islands were early acquisitions in the Imperial expansion. Because of their strategic location they were of more immediate interest to the Romans, and evidence from on going work there reflects this. While work at the Alkinoos (ID2609) harbour in Corfu is showing diversity of use over time, other finds on the island, such as bath-houses (Aharavi) and villas (Kassiopi) and Late Antique churches, are indicative of continuous occupation. At Vathy in Ithaca, a Roman to Late Roman complex with domestic shrine (Fig. 43) and associated bath was revealed (ID2597) and at Lefkada a Roman agricultural instal lation for olive-oil production and a wine press were found (ID2617) (Fig. 44). Other Ionian islands show more evidence for civic occupation. For example, a number of inscribed bases was found in a Fl-shape around a rectan gular paved area in Fiskardo (ancient Panormos, Kephallonia) which may well belong to a Roman agora (ID2593, ID431). One of the bases mentions the special relationship that the citizens of Panormos had with Hadrian. Other buildings, such as the odeion or theatre and bath, confirm the public character of this area. At Same and Krane public and private areas were investi gated: public baths and a potter's workshop respectively (ID2592, ID2602) (Fig. 26). The variety of material found at Kephallonia, also including material from older excavations by archaeologists such as Kallipolitis (the Roman villa at Skala and the baths and graves at Same), indicates strong potential for understanding the island in terms of its changing roles in the Roman network. Here, its early connections with Italy, and then with mainland Greece as it became part of the Empire, are in evidence. In comparison with the other Ionian islands, it is likely to have been a hub in the Roman network. This makes sense given its location at the mouth of the Gulf of Corinth. The work of the Kephallonia Survey Pottery Project (under taken by C. Souyoudzoglou-Haywood and the 6th/23rd EPCA) may provide more detailed diachronic evidence (www.iihsa.ie/kephalonia.html). Colonies over time and space: Patras and Thessaloniki As the networks and nodes within changed over time, so too might the roles that other towns or areas played in them. Applying the concept of networks enables us to break down periodization without the flattening effects of decontextualization. Other generalizations regarding similarities between cities of a certain status, such as Roman colonies, can be challenged. An examination of the recently discovered material in terms of networks helps to highlight diversities between colonies of different provinces and periods within Achaea and Macedonia. The nature of the Roman to Late Antique city of Patras (ID2341) continues to be elucidated with excava tions at Psila Alonia Square (a key focus within the Roman city). The extent of knowledge of this Roman city and hinterland is now impressive, with several key conferences (for example Rizakis and Lepenioti [2010]) and publica tions (Petropolous and Rizakis [1994]; Rizakis [1998]; [forthcoming]). The museum is an impressive showcase for an understanding of the topography of the Roman city as well as highlighting different types of spaces within the urban fabric. The private spaces of the houses and shops are well documented through the mosaics, which, wherever practical, are displayed on the floor. There is a marked contrast between private and industrial spaces which can be seen in the reconstruction of one of the 43.

Of note is the associated container for separating olive oil from water, a thoroughly Roman form. Other than the domestic space, the most recently opened rooms depict elements of public life with various zones of the city which are described and supplemented with evidence from Pausanias. With the area defined by the locations of the cemetery areas of the public city, religious space (particularly along the coast) and harbours, nymphaea (Germanou Street and also Vlachou Street) and bathing establishments (Aiolou St), entertainment areas (Stadium and Odeion) and the civic buildings of the agora are all attractively displayed so as to encourage the visitor to engage and associate the material with the overall topography of the Roman city. The evidence of mortuary practices as displayed in the museum is particularly striking, with a range of different types of tombs and burials reconstructed, and there is an unusual but striking display of a burial wreath resting on a skull rather than by itself (see also the excavations of the northeast cemetery: ID2343). The extent of knowledge of Roman and Late Antique Patras is impressive, particularly considering the successive layers of occupation that cover the city (ID2344,1D2345). It is in many respects a model for what can be achieved, despite the limitations set by the modern city. In a similar vein, the on-going work to present Roman, Late Antique and Byzantine Thessaloniki is notable, and the forum in particular is attractively presented. Much of what has been known about Thessaloniki is dated to the third century (when it became a colony and then a capital), but more recent excavations are helping to reveal its earlier Roman periods. Given its location on the Via Egnatia and with a profitable harbour, Thessaloniki must have been a hub in the Roman trade network and contex tualizing the evidence of the city in its wider provincial landscape is expanding this view. In the city centre, metro excavations are now focusing on the stations, for example Agia Sophia, where a section of the Roman road was revealed which had marble pavements lined by a portico (ID1970, ID2704). Its original construction dates to the third century and was finally replaced in the sixth century by a dirt track. While much of the Palace of Galerius can be seen from the surrounding streets, it is tantalizingly laid out and labelled, and it is a great pity that current circum stances prevent it from being opened to the public. Excavations around this area (in the South Portico and Germanou Street) (ID2711) revealed further evidence of Hellenistic buildings and Roman houses with evidence for mosaic floors, wall-painting, polychrome plaster and imported ceramics (from Italy and Asia Minor), as well as evidence for home industries (loomweights and stone and bone objects). The periods of occupation seem to be the first and third centuries AD. In other areas of the Roman province of Macedonia, at Panagia Diporou in Haliakmon, a Hellenistic house which continued to be occupied in the Roman period was excavated (ID2162). A range of network connections is likely at Haliakmon with its location at the mouth of the river Aliakmon and at the southern end of the Bay of Thessaloniki (ID2722). Lines of communication would</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 35 likely have ran along the coast north and south of here, and across the bay at the Angelochori harbour and inland along the river, which also enables rich agriculture. In advance of the Haliakmon dam construction, a large third- to fourth-century AD complex was uncovered with at least two rooms, one of which contained an impluvium and the other a tomb (ID2722). At the Poutakidis plot, Akrini, Kozanis, a public building or a sanctuary in a complex, which also included terracotta pipes, cisterns, architectural fragments and parts of a tessellated floor, was revealed (ID2725). The find of a possible sanctuary is one of the few Roman religious finds reported for 2011. This one is interesting in that it has potential to provide some architec tural evidence for Roman cult practice in the area, which is already known from inscriptions such as the dedication to Zeus Despotes (SEG 34.643). Nearby, at Kleitos, a multi-period site was investigated, providing evidence for Roman domestic occupation as well as a cemetery containing an array of grave goods such as glass and jewellery (ID2726). At Dimitrias (Thessaly) a third century bath-house was excavated, located beside a glass workshop (ID2715). Greece over time: chronological networks While issues of diversity between and within provinces have been emphasized, it is worth noting that elements of similarity and continuity are essential to understanding the nature of the provinces within the Empire. One of the directions that the development of theories such as creolization (Webster [2001]) or globalization (Hingley [2005]; Sweetman [2007]; Hitchner [2008]) has facilitated is the study of the diversity of people and places within the Empire. And while diversity certainly existed, it is also useful to be reminded that some areas may have been less different than they might have considered themselves, and, in fact, the Greek provinces are one such case. An image of the Greek provinces as remaining Greek under the Romans has been sustained throughout schol arship. In their early stages, the provinces of Roman Greece were often seen as being different or less 'Romanized' than other provinces, in part as a result of a level of respect from the Romans (from Augustus onwards) and in part due to the strength of Greek culture. The extent to which this is a true reflection of the situation or a reproduction by scholars of an image of Greek self representation has been called into question. Whether the Greeks really saw themselves as being different or special throughout the Imperial period is debatable. Such a view has often been adopted by scholars studying Roman Greece. Achaea: not so special? One of the themes that emerges from the most recent data is that, over a period of some four centuries, Achaea was often broadly similar to other provinces despite its special relationship with Rome and the level of cultural independence that may have followed. As with other cities and provinces, it is clear that certain periods saw particular investment. A diachronic view highlights targeted investment and the reasons for it may relate to varying roles in the Roman network society. At least one of its roles might have been to attract visitors, particularly to places like Athens, Sparta and indeed Epidauros on the basis of a historic past and cultural credibility. At certain periods some targeted investment in the cities may reflect these roles, for example under Hadrian and in the time of Herodes Atticus. Evidence for their investments continues to be found. For instance, on Ragavis and Tatoiou Streets, Kifissia (Attica) a second-century building was investigated which may belong to Herodes Atticus' villa there (ID2484). At the Little Theatre at Epidauros, the find of the torso of a slightly over-life sized marble male statue is likely to have been a second century example of a fourth-century Polykleitan-style Hermes (ID2407) (Fig. 45). It is suggested that its date coincides with the date of Hadrian's visit to Epidauros. Sparta was another popular destination in the Roman period, and excavations at Sparta continue to produce impressive quantities of Roman material - from villae urbanae (such as that from the Katsari property; ID2552) (Fig. 46) to cemeteries defining the extent of the city. More of the north cemetery was revealed during the widening of the Sparta-Karava road (ID2552) (Fig. 47). Part of the southwest boundary was defined by cemeteries found in the rescue excavations in the Mavridi-Katsari and Dimitrakopoulou-Zachariadi plots and in Byzantinou Street (ID2552). On the northeast side of the city, in the area of Limnai, excavations of the cemetery revealed a burial in the Sotiriou plot which was accompanied by a set of medical equipment (ID2552). In other parts of Achaia, at Mousga, Kyparissia in Messenia, three construction phases of a house were identified, dating from the first century BC, the third century AD and the fourth/fifth century AD. Two other houses in the area by the shore were also occupied from 45.

Work also continued at Petalidi (ancient Koroni) (ID2572) (Fig. 49), where the on-going rescue excava tions are bringing to light an extensive city with baths, workshops (glass and metal-working), domestic spaces and cemeteries. At Skafidia in Elis a significant large Roman building with mosaics, marble wall revetment and prominent views was excavated over two building plots. Sixteen rooms and a peristyle courtyard associated with the first- to fourth-century bath complex have been identified (ID2503). Finally, at the First Public School at Nafpaktos a large Roman complex of two buildings and at least nine rooms, many with geometric mosaics, was excavated (ID2394) (Fig. 50). 47. Sparta-Karava road: view of the north cemetery. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 5th EPCA. Continuity and no change? Scholars have a natural urge to compartmentalize cultural horizons within chronological boundaries (often estab lished by evidence from literary sources). However, there does not always have to be transformation of occupation or material culture in accordance with large-scale political, administrative or social change (for example when provinces became part of the Empire). While periodization enables the archaeologist to understand the material, at the same time evidence of continuity may be sidelined. This in turn emphasizes perceptions of cultural isolation - and a point of note from the 2011 material is the fact there is so much evidence for continuity from the Hellenistic to the Roman period to Late Antiquity.

This holds true for both urban and rural space. Urban space Theories of abandonment were commonly used to explain alterations in many cities at key periods of known historical change, for example in the first century at Corinth and Arta and in the fourth century at Knossos. It is increasingly clear that during the Late Antique period, the Greek city, far from diminishing, was actually flour ishing, and that some cities, rather than being abandoned, simply experienced a change of focus. The material from 2011 certainly shows this to be the case for Corinth where the identification of more of the city wall at the edge of the theatre indicates that the Late Antique city is likely to have been located somewhat east of the Roman one (ID2488). This is also the case for cities like Knossos, where the Late Antique city seems to have moved northwards somewhat and graves marking the edge of the city occupy what was previously domestic space (Sweetman [2010]). A similar situation may also be identified at Magoula (Sparta), where work at the Arapissa baths continued and an inter esting fourth-century mosaic with scenes from the palaestra in eight panels was exposed in an associated building (ID2549). The baths were originally constructed in the second to third century but were destroyed in the late fourth. Following this, they were remodelled to form a house, and then graves were inserted into the space in the Late Antique period, indicating a changing focus. The change in type of occupation is not limited just to the Roman to Late Antique transition. For example, at Chersonisos (Crete) there is some evidence for Roman and Late Antique domestic occupation over what was previously a Classical and Hellenistic cemetery (ID2775). In the Zabetakis plot in Agia Photini, Sybrita excavations exposed a Roman tomb in an earlier Hellenistic house (ID2855). Naturally, the situation of changing focus is not true of all Roman cities in all Greek provinces. In contrast, for example, the evidence for Chania on Crete seems to indicate that the Late Antique walls were set on top of the Hellenistic town walls (Fig. 51). Also, at Cleonai in Achaea the location of the Late Antique church in the agora indicates long-term continuity in the use of religious space, even from the Classical period in this case (ID2409). In some cases, rather than an overall transfor mation, pockets of changing use within a city may be visible. At Pallantion several test trenches were sunk in order to study the occupation of an area which seems to have been at its greatest extent during the Hellenistic to Roman period (ID2418). Here, a Late Antique potter's workshop was constructed over part of the city wall. Elsewhere, re-use of buildings for different purposes is demonstrated in the Athenian Agora excavations which focused on a well in the area of the Stoa Poikile. This building, it is suggested, may have been appropriated by a private individual and the colonnades filled in to create rooms within the building (ID2471). Also, in Achaea, at Makyneia, the bath complex of a (likely) Roman villa was refashioned with the construction of a potter's kiln, then a tomb was cut into the eschara of the kiln and then it was remodelled in the Late Antique period (ID2369). Regarding other provinces, the Daskaloyianni excava tions in Chania, Crete have shown that the substantial building saw long-term and continuous occupation, but that there were changes and alterations of the space within to suit the changing needs of the occupants (ID2838). In wttamu 51.

At Kastelli Chania (Syngekali Street) rescue excavations brought to light a circular building with a sixth-century mosaic floor, thus increasing the evidence for the Late Antique city which until recently was relatively paltry (ID2784). Already, the indications are that the Late Antique city seems to have flourished as the Roman one did. At Rethymnon, the only evidence thus far revealed for the Early Byzantine occupation of the town is a coin found during the excavations of Agioi Apostoloi (ID2793). Rural space The 2011 material shows a significant increase in the availability of more refined data regarding non-urban space. Until recently, the Greek evidence was generally limited to excavations from the urban sphere or survey evidence from the rural. Extensive archaeological surveys have provided scholars with invaluable evidence for understanding landscapes and sites within them, and one of the trends to note here is that material in rural areas is now being excavated as well as surveyed. Such work is making a steady contribution to the long-term view of occupation of a region and not just of isolated urban spaces. In addition to those areas in Crete mentioned above, and Epirus mentioned below, in Achaea agricul tural complexes have been excavated at Salamis (ID2638), Nafpaktos Gipedo (ID2388), Manari (Arcadia) (Late Roman; ID2425) (Fig. 52) and Monastiriako rema Ambelakiou Petrinas (third to fourth century; ID2431). The latter two are multi functional sites with workshops or processing areas. 52. Manari, Arcadia: wine press. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 39th EPCA. Epirus: a diachronic view These issues regarding «interpretation of archaeological lacunae in cities and rural spaces and for specific periods are encapsulated in recent and striking work in the province of Epirus. At Arta (ancient Ambracia), the evidence for Roman material continues to grow, to supplement the survey of known material undertaken by V. Karatzeni in 2001. For example, the fourth- to third century BC northwest cemetery space was re-used for an olive-oil workshop until its destruction in the late first to early second century (ID2512). Although studies of Ambracia still largely focus on the extensive Hellenistic and Byzantine remains (examples of which are noted in the Ephoreia reports), the steady discoveries of Roman material here and in other parts of Epirus indicate that devastation wreaked by Romans and then Thracians on the area was not as debilitating as once thought. As with other cities which are presumed to be abandoned, in part based on an assessment of historical data, the archaeological evidence for Arta indicates that it did continue after the population moved to Nikopolis in the late first century (Karatzeni [2001] 168). Evidence for Roman and Early Byzantine building remains were also identified in the plain of Arta (ID2540). At Astakos a Late Roman and Late Antique settlement with a fourth-century mosaic floor was revealed, where the apse of the church may also be identified (ID2389) (Fig. 53). 53. Astakos: mosaic from Late Roman and Late Antique settlement. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 8th EBA. While excavations in Epirus continue to show evidence for a strong occupation of urban spaces in the Roman period, even in areas previously thought to be abandoned, work undertaken to elucidate rural occupation has produced dramatic results. Farmsteads and rural villas have been located all around the province, in valleys and on mountains, providing excellent potential for an up-to date study of the countryside in the Roman period. This is further enhanced by the publication of the second volume of the Thesprotia Expedition (Forsén and Tikkala [2011]). In the Arta area, data is increasing with the study of the agricultural residence at Seliades (ID2513) (just south of Arta) which was in use from the second half of the fourth century BC to the fourth century AD (Fig. 54) and the impressive Roman rural villa on the Louros river</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011 -2012 39 n 54. Sellades: agricultural residence. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 33rd EPCA. (ID2535), near Agios Georgios in the Preveza prefecture. The five rooms here had mosaic floors and an associated bath-house, and located nearby are sections of the already known aqueduct (Karatzeni [2001] 169). In the Ioannina prefecture, an agricultural complex and Hellenistic house were revealed to the south of Ioannina city. At Ioannina itself, a new study of the diachronic occupation of the Kastro has been undertaken (ID2520). In the north, close to the modem Albanian border, a first-century agricultural residence was excavated at Ktismata Delvinaki (ID2517). The volumes produced by the 32nd EPCA in 2008 on Gitana, Dymokastro, Dolianis and Elea are welcome additions to publications of the area (Kanta Kitsou [2008]; Kanta-Kitsou and Lambrou [2008]; Lazari et al. [2008]; Riginos and Lazari [2008]). In the area of Thesprotia (ID1929), the Paramythia valley has proved to be particularly well occupied in the Roman period. Here, a number of rural residences was discovered in an area which had in the previous periods (Classical and Hellenistic) only been used for burial purposes. In the southern plains of Louros and Zaiongou remains of the aqueduct and a large agricultural complex were investi gated, revealing pebble and mosaic floors as well as cisterns and workshops (ID2535). At Pnevmatikos Pharos Tarana, two agricultural residences and graves were dated to the late third or fourth century (ID2530). Extensive work on the cemeteries has also been under taken at Neochori (ID2523), Gitana (ID2524) and Elatos (ID2539). Mortuary evidence: need for contextualization To date, much of the work on mortuary practices in the Greek provinces has been focused on discrete areas. There is significant potential to undertake a wider-scale provincial study of the different types of practices, grave goods and epigraphic data in relation to the domestic and civic evidence of communities. The burial evidence in some cases may indicate lack of impact in terms of Roman involvement in Greece. It is clear that many of the cemeteries continue to be used, often without inter ruption, from the Hellenistic through to the Roman period. The cemetery at 90 E. Venizelos Ave in Salamis (ID2638) has Middle Geometric to Late Roman remains, and at Langadoula, Nafpaktos (ID2387), the Hellenistic cemetery continued to be used into the Roman period. In context, this may be indicative of the extent (if any) of the impact that the changing political and administrative status of the area had on certain sections of the population. The interruptions in use of a cemetery can only really be understood when seen in relation to the wider context, including other mortuary and domestic evidence. In Megalopolis (Lyktora Street and Kephala Sreet) (ID2427) a late Hellenistic cemetery also has mid Roman burials, and at Pharmaki Square, Nafpaktos (ID2372) the Hellenistic cemetery also contains a Late Roman building with five graves. In Chania, at Hatzidaki Street, the Hellenistic cemetery was re-used in the late first to early second century, but more work is needed to understand what was happening in the inter vening period (ID2846). Burial practices may evolve or be used by various members of the community, as seen at Apokoronou Street where an unusual Roman funerary monument was restudied. This evolved from the Hellenistic loculus type (ID2851), and it is suggested that this type fills in a gap in the evidence of the development of mortuary practices in Chania. Multiple forms of burials in a single cemetery may also be indicative of different populations, or at least tastes and aspirations, and many of the Greek cemeteries have evidence for a variety of different burials in the Roman period, from cist graves, to monumental tombs (for example one with a dromos at Tsingouna on the north of Kephala hill in Crete: ID2855) to rock-cut tombs (for example there were rock-cut tombs and cist graves nearby the Apokoronou Street cemetery in Chania with the large tomb). Some idiosyncrasies continue to be found, for example at Andritsa Cave (ID2404) groups of burials (some 40 individuals) and pottery dating to the Late Roman period were excavated from the cave. At Mantineia in Arcadia excavated burials were notable for the richness of the associated grave goods, considered unusual for Arcadia (ID2417). Change and continuity are understandable in terms of individuals (local, Roman and other provincials) and their varying social roles. Similar processes may be seen in terms of religion, where in many examples the same cemetery and mortuary practices continued to be used even when Christianity became the state religion. The cemetery at 105 Eleftherias Street in Moschato, Athens (ID2451) is an example where a Late Roman cemetery continued in use until Late Antiquity. Associated epigraphic evidence from the 2011 material covers a rich variety of types: for example stelae (from Sybrita [ID2855] and Chania) and the two seals found in the Thessaloniki east necropolis (excavated in the 1970s), one of which had a magical inscription and the other showing the Egyptian deity Bes Pantheos (Eleutheros Typos 23.02.12; http://www.makthes.gr/news/arts/84328). Overall, the vast quantity of mortuary material and related epigraphy in the Greek provinces could usefully be synthesized to analyse evidence for different groups within various communities. Cemeteries from different provinces and areas within them could be compared. Continuity and change in multi-period sites (such as Langadoula in Nafpaktos [ID2387] or Sphakaki on Crete, both Hellenistic and Roman cemeteries) could be contrasted with sites of a single period but with extensive numbers of burials and variation in mortuary practices (for example Loutres at Ierapetra in Crete or Elatos Korphovouni in Epirus [ID2539]).</page><page sequence="40">40 REBECCA SWEETMAN Conclusion: contacts and networks While much of the material that has been reported for 2011 can be used to help in broader discussions of contacts and networks, it is refreshing that there are also new finds that could alter the way we traditionally think about certain buildings, sites or even areas. At Kenchreai an area of the harbour which had been identified as the Atrium Veneris (part of a cult building) is now possibly a library of a large seaside villa or public facility (ID2490). In the founda tions of the first hotel in Athens, the Aiolos, the southeast corner of Hadrian's library and part of a gate or a tower of the post-Herulian wall was excavated (ID2478) (Fig. 55). There are plans to renovate the building and to maintain the archaeology and make it visible. During work at the theatre in Gortyn (ID2818), finds of horse bits may be associated with earlier finds of a manger with skeletons of horses which had been caught in the collapse caused by the AD 365 earthquake. Altogether the finds indicate the use of the area as the stables which are commonly found at the end of the circus. In Opagia Dollana, the walled settlement which contained two Early Christian churches was investigated (ID2543). The mosaics of the north and south aisles of one of the churches depicted hunt scenes, wild animal combats and marine personifications, which are unusual images for mosaics of this period in Greece. The use of figurai decoration like this is much more akin to mosaics of the East, in areas such as Palestine or Syria. Mosaics such as that found in the Alkman Street excava tions in Sparta, of a fifth- to sixth-century basilica with geometric designs in panels, are much more like the standard for Greece (ID2559). Finally, studies of the Odeion at Dion in 2011 have contributed greatly to the understanding of the architectural form and interior décor, and their roles in the acoustics of the buildings (ID2697). For example, here it seems that curtains were used primarily to enhance the sound quality, as were the wood lined floor, seats, ceiling and even the decorated plaster on the walls. Roman Greece may never escape from the shadows of its great Classical past or Byzantine future, but it is a period that has been receiving attention for its own sake rather than as an inconvenient means to reach earlier levels. Although innovative approaches (Horden and Purcell [2000]) and large-scale studies such as that of the Roman economy undertaken by the Oxford Roman Economy Project (http://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/; see also Bowman and Wilson [2009]; [2011]) are making a signif icant contribution to macro-scale understanding of the Mediterranean, there is a great deal of work to be done on networks. Current work on the pottery and broader studies of areas such as the Cyclades in the Roman period should make a solid contribution to this. Evidence of networks and contexts plays a much greater role in the interpretation of Roman provincial archaeology. Much of the archaeo logical material in AR 2011 pertaining to Roman Greece has implications for the approach to its study. By examining evidence for chronological continuity and geographical contact it is possible to gain insights into the various roles which the Greek provinces may have played in the larger Roman network, while allowing for diversity of areas and social groups. Although evidence of religious roles is clearly absent from the 2011 material, on-going contextualization and more detailed study will allow a developed understanding of the various roles played by the different provinces in Greece at various times. % 55.

Human figurines, mostly female, occur outside the main temenos. Twenty four boat models dating from the later seventh through to the late sixth/early fifth century were identified. Horse-and-riders (ca. 250) remain the most ubiquitous group, though four small shields were recovered from the temenos floor from the late sixth and fifth centuries BC. Other animals remain rare, and figurines decline sharply in number over the Classical period before disappearing in the course of the fourth and third centuries. Assessing these artefacts as part of a broader contextualized archaeological landscape, in association with other classes of material culture, shows how even long-studied religious landscapes can provide new knowledge. The changing face of ritual deposition over time, the plurality of potential religious observation within particular landscapes, all speak to practices that were flexible and responsive to the social requirements of the local communities. Within and around ancient Corinth (www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes 111—13), a wealth of information has been recovered from rescue excavations, many conducted in advance of construction of the high-speed railway and the widening of the national road from Corinth to Patras (ID2492, ID2493). The 37th EPCA (previously the 4th EPCA) reports the discovery of 12 Archaic larnax burials, mostly unadorned, two of which were children, 73 graves from an Archaic cemetery (34 contained offerings) and a further 160 graves of different types and indeterminate periods (but including Bronze Age chamber tombs). Within ancient Corinth at Loutsa (Lazarou-Angelou property) 38 Archaic to Hellenistic tombs were uncovered (ID2495). The tombs had no consistent orientation and were varied in terms of grave goods. Simple pit graves, pits with tile covers and sarcophagi were all represented and typical offerings consisted of lekythoi, aryballoi, oinochoae, skyphoi, miniature vases, gold leaf and bronze earrings. During the widening of the national road, a quarry was discovered to the north of ancient Corinth (ID2493). The few portable finds indicate that the quarry was used during the Archaic period, perhaps for the manufacture of sarcophagi for the neighbouring Archaic and Classical cemetery, and for the Archaic city wall (Fig. 56). West of the quarry, excavation for a bridge revealed an Archaic Daniel Stewart School of Archaeology and Ancient History, University of Leicester Introduction There have been several developments in the archaeology of the Peloponnese over the past year, which add to (or amend) the trends identified in last year's report (AR 57 [2010-2011] 49). Those trends were increasing interdisci plinarity, an appreciation for scale and place as key concepts impacting archaeological interpretation and a more critical approach to topographic sources (both material and textual). These continue in the projects discussed below. To this list we may also add several other emerging trends. Of particular utility to researchers is the improvement in the dissemination of material via online resources. AGOnline has, I think, shown itself to be an increasingly valuable resource, especially as existing entries are reviewed and modified as new information emerges. The development of a dynamic and evolving database of archaeological materials relating to Greece, rather than a series of static entries, highlights the increas ingly transient nature of archaeological knowledge. Added to this is the publication of the regional summaries of the various Ephoreias by the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports (www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes) covering 2000-2010, a resource that has yet to be fully exploited but has immeasurable potential. We might also identify an entrenchment or trend for consolidation amongst existing projects, both in a material and metaphorical sense. Budgets are squeezed everywhere, and in several cases we might read the impact of this in the growing focus on artefact studies and more restricted campaign objectives. A focus on the consolidation of knowledge, rather than the accumulation of new data from the field, is an almost inevitable outcome of reduced funding, but it has its benefits; the reassessment of artefact typologies, the refinement of ceramic chronologies, the synthesis of acquired data are all welcome. Archaic period Significant archaeological research relating to the Archaic period concentrated on religious sites and sanctuaries, with the mentioned renewed emphasis on artefact studies and consolidation evident. Carefully contextualized studies of various artefact types highlight the importance of viewing artefacts as components of broader assemblages, rather than simply viewing them as representative of standard 'types'. At the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia (as reported by E. Gebhard [ASCSA/Chicago]) (ID2489), analyses of burned pottery and Corinthian comparanda from dated contexts suggest that the Archaic temple was destroyed in a fire in 460-450 BC. Continued artefact studies of the mortaria from the Great Circular Reservoir show that all of them belong to the first half of the fifth century or the mid fifth century, supporting the hypothesis that the area of the reservoir was used for food preparation and feasting from ca. 550^150 BC. Perhaps the most significant development at Isthmia comes from continued study of recovered votive figurines. A group from the Sacred Glen west of the temenos of Poseidon is more typical of dedications for female deities, and, when judged alongside two fourth-century inscribed dedications to Demeter, suggests a shrine to the goddess existed here. 56.

Thirty tombs were excavated, four of which were child burials: nine larnax burials, seven cist graves, 12 pits with limestone cover slabs and two pits without covers. The information is admittedly patchy, but it speaks to a commemorative landscape of some duration surrounding the polis of Corinth. The implications for our understanding of burial practices are quite tantalizing: not only does it represent a corpus of over 300 graves from over 500 years of the region's history, but it is highly suggestive of the consistent memorial character of some elements of the landscape. Further south in the Corinthia, consolidation can be seen in the continuation of work to restore the entablature at the northeast comer of the Temple of Zeus at Nemea, and in the careful excavation and study of material from beneath the Hellenistic Heroôn. K. Shelton (ASCSA/Berkeley) reports that seven of ten architrave blocks were restored fully with the final three nearing completion (ID2406). Carefully targeted excavation (Figs 57, 58) shows a greater investment in site formation during the Archaic period than previously suspected. Trenches 2, 5 (F19) and 4 (El9) focused on defining the western boundary wall of the Heroôn, its phasing and relationship to its immediate surroundings. Alternating 57.

Early Archaic material within the accumulated fill strongly suggests an Archaic date for the artificial earthen mound. Immediately outside the Hellenistic western Hereon enclosure wall, the Archaic enclosure wall rested directly upon an artificial sloping layer of tightly-packed large stones (ID1880; the 'rock garden' of AR 57 [2010-2011] 49; Hesperia 50 [1981] 60-65). There is evidence of several construction phases, but for the moment the purpose is elusive - though likely related to the stone packing east of the enclosure. Archaic finds include a crushed, but mostly preserved and deliberately deposited, bronze omphalos phiale (Fig. 59) which was recovered from amongst the large stones along with fragments of an Attic black-figure vessel. Two main phases of Archaic activity were revealed in G19. A foundation trench for a partially robbed wall (G19 wall i) provided an Archaic date for its construction. A number of other fills were uncovered, containing a number of whole pots (a kantharos, kotyle and cup/mug) deposited along with the mound layers. Overall, these phases date to the end of the sixth to the early fifth century and represent the final phase in the construction of the Hereon mound. The full extent of wall ii (El 9) was revealed, including the foundation course. Two construction techniques are in evidence: the eastern face consists of two or three courses of medium to very large cut limestone blocks, all likely re used, set in a quasi-polygonal fashion, while the western side is composed of much smaller irregularly-joined stones. On the north end of this wall, tightly-packed large leveling stones directly abut the western face and seem to be contemporary with, or later than, its construction. The wall foundations themselves rest on a level of large stones revealed at both the northern and southern ends (Fig. 60). The southernmost stones abut (and perhaps partially fill) a cutting into virgin clay soil similar to that in G19. The cutting and the stone feature both date to the Late Archaic/Early Classical period judging by recovered pottery, around the time of the construction of the Hereon mound or slightly later. The careful, even nuanced, recording of these features speaks to an extensive phase of landscape intervention in the Archaic period that set the stage for Classical and Hellenistic developments.</page><page sequence="44">44 DANIEL STEWART 60.

In nearby Sikyon, E. 0stby (ASA) (ID2487; Krystalli Votsi and 0stby [2010]) reports on a study of architectural members from the temple and altar excavated between 1928-1988 (first by A. Philadelpheus and A. Orlandos in the 1920s and 1930s, subsequently by K. Krystalli-Votsi in the 1980s). The temple had three construction phases, two Archaic (seventh and sixth centuries) and one Early Elellenistic. The Archaic altar was renovated in the Hellenistic period. A round base in the temple sekos probably supported a large tripod and perhaps sustains the identification of the temple as that of Apollo noted by Pausanias (2.7.8-9). To the north of the Sikyonian plateau, the 37th EPCA reports the discovery, in the course of motorway construction, of a Middle Geometric to Hellenistic cemetery (ID2500) (Fig. 61). Fifty five tombs were excavated, most of which were fifth-century pit tombs with cover slabs. Larnakes also contained single and multiple burials. South of the Corinthia in Argos, rescue excavations by the 4th EPCA have produced evidence for Archaic (and earlier) burials in various locations. On Herakleous Street (properties of A. Koutroubi and K. Theodoropoulou) (ID2411) a built cist tomb used for more than one burial and two enchytrismoi (without accompanying goods) in a krater with upswung handles and a pithos were recovered. At the junction of Korinthou and Heras Streets (property of P. and I. Bozionelou, reported originally in 2007) a Late Geometric to Early Archaic cemetery has been investí gated (ID293). A bronze cinerary urn was found, containing the remains of sheets of cloth and pomegranate seeds (Fig. 62), perhaps an instance of aristocratic behaviour echoing poetic paradigms laid down in the Homeric epics. In Tegea, Episkopi (property of G. Oikonomopoulou) the 39th EPCA reports the discovery of an Early Archaic to Early Hellenistic potter's workshop, perhaps close to a shrine to judge from the nature of the finds: lion-head spouts, basins, marble roof tiles and Late Archaic to Early Classical fine pottery (ID2424). This is the first confirmed establishment for the local production of pottery. In south Kynouria, Arkadia at Leonidio, Plaka, the 39th EPCA reports that cleaning of the ancient city wall at Agios Athanasios revealed the full length of its northern branch (ID2436). Inside the fortification, the area was terraced with strong retaining walls with occasional tower-like projections. Trial excavation at Eurias, north of the wall, recovered much sixth-century Lakonian pottery (mostly black glaze but with distinctive kraters, lekanes and Lakonian kylikes) as well as some Late Corinthian sherds. As mentioned above, the recent publication of the Ephoreias' work has expanded our picture of the memorial character of many ancient sites. Sparta is no exception. Within the online resource, the 9th EPCA presents an overview of the results of rescue excavation from 2000-2010, which recovered Protogeometric, Geometric, Archaic and Classical pottery, architectural remains and a significant number of tombs, especially in the area of ancient Limnai and in the area south of the acropolis (ID2552). Votive deposits also confirm the location of a number of Archaic and Classical sanctuaries, though these remain unidentified in the particulars. To the west, in Messenia at n.O.T.A. (flcpio-/i) OXoK/vripfopévriç ToDpicmKijç Avàîiruçriç, Tourism Development Area) Romanou, Pylias, the 38th EPCA reports the excavation, in the area of the golf course, of a long Archaic building (probably a temple), oriented east-west (ID2571). It had an internal colonnade and an undisturbed destruction deposit. The building remained in use into the Early Hellenistic period (Fig. 63). Just to the west of the temple was an open-air shrine with a large quantity of seventh-century BC terracotta figurines of Potnia Theron type. 61.

Romanou, Pylias: (probably) Archaic temple. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 38th EPCA. At Ano Melpeia, Petroula (Messenia, west of Megalopolis), X. Arapogianni (former Director, 38th EPCA) reports on excavation following the discovery of a large quantity of architectural spolia during the demolition of the modem church of Prophitis Elias (ID2582). The foundations of a late sixth- or early fifth-century BC temple were revealed (Fig. 64), with maximum preserved dimensions of 20.65 x 10.75m. A small foundation within the building probably belongs to the first, Archaic, temple of the late sixth century. In addition to pottery (plus miniature vessels), finds include a bronze bracelet with snake-head finíais, a bronze figurine of a naked warrior carrying a spear, a bronze rod terminating in a lion's head, a small bronze vessel, bronze sheet with a relief depiction of a procession of women carrying branches, iron nails, a large quantity of iron spearheads and a sherd with a dedicatory graffito: ANE0EKEN. Further to the west, at Prasidaki (Elliniko), in 2002 the 7th EPCA discovered a peripteral (6 x 13) Archaic temple of Athena Agonos at the site of an Early Classical Doric temple (ID2506). The temple appears to have been destroyed by an earthquake and subsequent fire in the first to second century AD. The base of the cult statue is preserved, and the roof had rich painted and plastic decoration. A recovered votive inscription on the lip of a bronze bowl provides the identification: A0ANAI AFOPIOIL APIOYNTIAI ANE0EKEN. Settlement remains and tombs surrounded the temple (Fig. 65). Far to the north, on Mygdalia Hill, Patras, L. Papazoglou-Manioudaki (National Archaeological Museum) directed the 2011 excavation season in the Mycenaean settlement. Of interest in the context of this chapter are the remains of the peristasis of an early Archaic temple that partially covered the ruins of the Mycenaean buildings and extended to the south (ID2340) (Figs 66, 67). Early Archaic pottery was recovered on top of the ruins of the Mycenaean wall. An iron dagger and a bronze strigil were found in situ by the base of the eastern peristasis, deposited at the time of the foundation. This is one of the first early Greek temples excavated in western Achaea (in the Patras area), and the existence of a cult building using the same local stone as the Mycenaean settlement and situated in a direct relationship with it is of some importance. %i B» &amp;6 64.

Prasidaki: Doric Temple of Athena. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 7th EPCA. Classical period Material from the Classical period was notable for its absence in the collated reports. The majority of the infor mation reported here comes from rescue excavations, and presents no clear narrative but a rather patchy under standing. Such material does, however, have interesting implications for our understanding of assemblage formation and surface/subsurface relationships. Where Classical material is present on research projects, it is usually as one component amongst many - suggestive of a Classical 'shore' between waves of population nucle ation and dispersal, perhaps. At Corinth, various graves of the period were recovered during rescue excavations in advance of construction work, including a group of 12 graves (11 limestone sarcophagi and one pit). A 12m-long stretch of the western branch of the long walls between Corinth and Lechaion was traced, and several groups of graves (Classical through to Byzantine) were recorded in the vicinity (ID2492) (Fig. 68). A section of a 3.5m-wide paved road with wheel ruts was also recorded, mnning southeast-northwest. Conservation activity on the Diolkos was undertaken in 2009-2010, under the auspices of the Ephoreia of Maritime Antiquities (ID2501) (Fig. 69). Recent publica tions on the diolkos (Lohmann [forthcoming]; Pettegrew [2011]) are leading to a radical revision of both its period of construction and its function (though consensus remains elusive). At Perdikaria (ancient Kromna), the 37th EPCA discovered, in 2004-2005, an extensive 66.

Geometric and Classical cemetery (ID2496). Four Geometric pit graves, 18 Classical sarcophagi and a pit grave with a child burial were recorded.

Perdikaria: Geometric and Classical cemetery. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 37th EPCA. To the south, in the Argolid at Delpriza (Kranidi), A. Kossyva (4th EPCA) reports part of a Classical (fifth- and fourth-century) cemetery of 43 graves on the eastern slope of a low hill, 700m south of Koilada bay (ID2408). The graves were situated in at least three rows on two artificial terraces, generally north-south in orientation. Twenty five of the graves are elliptical pits, and there were 11 tile graves (covered with Classical Lakonian tile). There were four cist graves. At least 38 adults and four infants are currently identified. The deceased were deposited directly on the earthen grave floor, mostly laid supine and extended, and there is currently no evidence for grave markers. The cemetery likely belongs to a rural community in a fertile area near the coastal town of Mases. A rural workshop with a stone oil press further north on the same hill is provisionally dated to the fourth to third century BC. To the west in Arkadia, during rescue excavations in 2008 at Dimitsana (property of G. Petropoulou), the 39th EPCA discovered part of the foundation of the fortification wall of ancient Teuthis (ID2432) (Fig. 71). The wall had two construction phases: the first, in the fifth century, was in pseudo-polygonal style and the second, in the polygonal style, is dated to the Late Classical or Early Hellenistic period. South of this, and northeast of the village of Perivolia, the 39th EPCA discovered, during the construction of the Megalopolis junction on the Tripolis to Kalamata motorway from 2008 2010, a planned settlement of the fifth and fourth centuries (though with evidence of occupation stretching back to the Geometric period) (ID2429). Residential insulae were organized around a regular grid of streets and stone-paved roads. The site, which lies outside modem Megalopolis, was identified before excavation with ancient Aimonion, mentioned by Pausanias (8.44.1). In Messenia, at ancient Thouria, X. Arapogianni (ASA) continued excavation, clarifying the layout of the large public buildings on the terrace (ID2565) (the northernmost, Building A, was excavated in 2009 and the</page><page sequence="48">48 DANIEL STEWART w: 71.

The stylobate of Building B, south of Building A, was uncovered for a length of 1 lm. An Ionic colonnade runs parallel to Building A, 4.2m away, and the two buildings, A and B, seem to form an Ionic stoa, from which many architectural members are preserved (Fig. 72). Dedicatory inscriptions recovered from the south front of Building F record that two parents, Aristophanes and Philotis, dedicated a statue of their son Philoxenos to Asklepios and Hygeia. In the area between the temple and the stoa was a 0.2m thick layer indicative of cult activity: a large quantity of animal bones (pigs, wild boar, bovines and poultry), shells, sherds and ash was recovered. The inscriptions, together with the marble offering table discovered in 2009 and the inscribed 'treasure receptacle' of 2010, make the identification of the structure as a temple to Asklepios and Hygeia secure. The survey of the poleis of ancient Triphylia continued into its sixth and final field season (ID2079). Situated southwest of Olympia, Triphylia was long a contested region of the Peloponnese. This season, as reported by G. Chatzi (Director, 7th EPCA), J. Heiden (DAI) and C. Rohn (Rhein-Main), focused on consoli dating and verifying information gathered in previous seasons, including topographic plans of Skilloundia, Samikon, Platiana, Lepreon, Vrestos, Tripiti and the Kastro above Anilio. Extra-urban survey aimed to assess the extent of the poleis' choras and trace the road system. At Vrina, near a large funerary complex, a lOOm-long stretch of ancient road ran along the northern slope of the Lapithos mountains and linked Samikon with the cities of eastern Triphylia. In Samikon itself, extensive building founda tions below the city (Fig. 73) may belong to the federal sanctuary of the Triphylians (Strabo 8.3.13-20). It is interesting to note that the surveyors discuss their work in terms of 'prospection', with an eye for topographic description reminiscent of the work of Y. Pikoulas (2007) and W. Pritchett (1999). The confluence of 'tried and true' techniques and computer-aided archae ology (as seen in their database containing photographs and architectural drawings at 1:50 for selected areas, with some 2D and 3D reconstructions, Fig. 74) is potentially at odds with more post-modern approaches to broader landscapes. It will be interesting to watch the devel opment and publication of the results in light of this. To the north, Olympia suffered a double shock in 2011-2012: the death of the prolific Nikolaos Yalouris at age of 92 and the armed robbery of the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games. These incidents are emblematic of two seismic changes facing Greek archae ology: the looming generational demographic shift and the increasing risk to heritage sites. Both of these challenges represent the potential loss of reams of archaeological data. mi % 72. Thouria: columns of the Ionic stoa. © ASA. 1 73.

Olympia, south of the stadium: in the southwest comer of Q 11.1 (rear) Dôrpfeld's trench lies over Classical to Roman debris. © DAI. At the archaeological site itself, work continued under R. Senff (DAI) in a bid to clarify the complex stratigraphy to the east of the Southeast Complex (ID2505). We might read in these works evidence of consolidation. The new sondage (Q 11.1) revealed a backfilled trench from Dôrpfeld's excavations (Fig. 75), under which were many Classical coins and kiln spacers. The latter suggest a potter's workshop in the vicinity. At the western end of the stadium starting line, excavation was conducted to explore remains previously identified in 1879. Part of the Roman starting mechanism was recovered in the form of a heavy lead weight (Fig. 76), and the original starting system seems to be evident in remains recovered at the northern end of the starting line. Hellenistic and Roman periods As with last year's report, I will discuss the Hellenistic and Roman periods together, partially due to the continuing issues of periodization and partially due to the nature of the reports themselves. Evident within many of the reports, however, is that same sense of retranchement, of bedding in and consolidating, that is discussed above. For example, this can be seen in the re-examination of previously excavated structures at Corinth. Under the direction of G. Sanders (ASCSA), a 3D study of the Peirene court and water basins was completed, and C.K. Williams II (ASCSA) undertook a restudy of the western part of the west hall of the theatre (ID2488). Some of the west analemma of the Greek theatre was exposed immedi ately beneath the earliest Roman levels. Evidence for two different types of buttresses used to reinforce the theatre within the first and second centuries AD was recovered in the west parodos adjacent to the west hall. A deep fill of Late Roman amphorae against the north wall of the west hall was partially excavated. The most numerous ceramic type was the two-handled Late Roman water jar from Asia Minor, suggestive of a nearby market or warehouse. Deposits of Late Roman and later material (sherds, and sheep and cattle bone primarily) testify to the length of use, even if its function as a theatre was long over. Traces of Hellenistic occupation within Corinth were recovered in various rescue excavations. At Anapnoa (property of A. Papathanasopoulou) a cemetery was discovered alongside the road leading to the Phlious Gate (ID2494) and at Loutsa (Lazarou-Angelou property) a further 38 Archaic to Hellenistic tombs were recovered, along with a Roman kiln (ID2495). The relationship between the kiln and the graves is worth marking for further study, as it has the potential to cast some light on the so-called Interim period. At the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia (ID2489), T. Gregory (Ohio) continued to explore the large Early Roman building reported in AR 57 (2010-2011) 57 (ID1883). In its northwestern corner were the remains of a furnace designed to heat an indeterminate space within the building: large quantities of soot and fragments of a heating system were found. The building was evidently not part of the second-century AD bath, but may have been a heated room added to the earlier, Classical, bath prior to construction of the Roman baths. There are interesting implications for the evolving use of water in post-Classical contexts, if the relationship between this structure, the Classical baths and the later Roman baths can be clarified. To the south of Corinth at Kenchreai, work under the direction of J.L. Rife (ASCSA/Vanderbilt) was focused on the (re)study of finds and records from the Kenchreai excavations of 1962-1969 and the Kenchreai Cemetery Project (2002-2006) (ID2490). Re-examination of various standing remains (the base of the north mole of the harbour and the 'brick building' to the northeast) led to some interesting observations regarding building techniques. The construction of the 'brick building' is not m 76. Olympia, stadium: lead weight. © DAI.</page><page sequence="50">50 DANIEL STEWART atypical of the region in the Early to Middle Roman period, and, most interestingly, there is no architectural evidence to support the published identification of the large north hall as a meeting room or cult space for Aphrodite (Aphrodision or Atrium Veneris: Scranton [1978] 79-90; perhaps suggested by Pausanius 2.2.3). On the nearby Koutsongila Ridge, E. Korka (Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports), J.L. Rife (ASCSA/Vanderbilt) and K. Kissas (Director, 37th EPCA) undertook a study season. A series of detailed studies on glass, metal items, architecture and ceramics was begun, but most troubling was the evidence of the five new illicit excavations in the northern and central areas of the ridge, disturbing several graves. Disturbed graves of a different sort were recorded in the area of Sikyon by the 37th EPCA. Thirty Mycenaean rock cut chamber and double cist graves were found, along with 42 fifth- to fourth-century pit graves. It appears as if the graves, of the earlier periods especially, formed an integral part of a memorial landscape steeped in the perception and reception of a mythic past. Evidence of ancestor worship was found at most of the chamber tombs from Late Protogeometric to Early Hellenistic times (Fig. 77). 77. Sikyonia: re-used Bronze Age tombs. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 37th EPCA. At Mavra Litharia, the harbour of ancient Aigeira (Nachmia Iakovou property), the 37th EPCA discovered part of the harbour mole oriented east-west (ID2498) (Figs 38, 78). The 17.4m-long stretch revealed three levels: the superstructure was built of cobble stones of varying sizes set horizontally and vertically in cement; the middle level was of courses of dressed masonry of local stone (mostly sandstone), most of which were in secondary use; the bottom layer consists of sand, shell and cobbestones in a natural conformation. The recovered ceramics show that the harbour was built in the second or the first half of the third century AD, coincident with the construction of the theatre at Aigeira in the reign of Maximinus Thrax (AD 235-238) . The abandonment of the harbour should be related to the general abandonment of the city after an earthquake in the mid-third century AD. Turning to the south, skipping over the recovered marble torso at Epidauros (discussed in the 'Roman Greece' section), the combination of research-driven and rescue archaeologies at Argos has expanded our under standing of that polis. At Herakleous Street (properties of 78. Mavra Litharia, ancient Aigeira: harbour mole. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 37th EPCA. A. Koutroubi and K. Theodoropoulou), rescue work carried out by the 4th EPCA uncovered building remains of many periods on two plots close to the southeast slope of the Prophitis Elias hill (ID2411). Hellenistic (fourth- to third century) remains include stone house walls, three dumps of domestic pottery and three cremation burials in close proximity. It is tantalizing to ponder the exact relationship between the domestic dwellings and the cremation burials, which will hopefully become more clear in future. Other glimpses into the funereal character of the broader landscape come from the junction of Diomedous and Megalou Alexandrou Streets (property of I. Alexopoulou) (ID2410). Ch. Piteraos (4th EPCA) recovered a third- or second-century BC cremation burial in an amphora placed inside a rectangular receptacle (Figs 79, 80). Accompanying finds included a gold coin of Sikyon as the danake, a Rhodian silver coin, a gold wreath of olive or myrtle leaves and an iron ring. This rare ash urn perhaps contained the remains of an Argive athlete, according to the excavator. The French School (G. Touchais, A. Philippa-Touchais and S. Fachard, in collaboration with E. Margaritis) began a new research programme on Prophitis Elias hill, primarily concerned with the diachronic study of fortifica tions on the Aspis (ID2635). Research has focused on three areas: the northeast (Fig. 81: VI), the semicircular tower and the southeast (Fig. 81: IV). In the northeast, cleaning and excavation of the fortifications confirm an early Hellenistic foundation. The semicircular tower was subject to a stone-by-stone survey (Fig. 82), with particular attention to surface treatment and joints between stones. Excavation in the southeast aimed to clarify the relationship of the 'outer wall' with the rest of the fortifi cations. Alongside this work dedicated ceramic and palaeoethnobotanical studies took place. For Sparta in Lakonia, the online publication by the the then Ministry of Culture and Tourism has provided a wealth of new data relating to the Hellenistic and Roman phases of the polis (ID2552). In the area of ancient Limnal, part of the Hellenistic city wall, with two orthogonal towers, was recovered north of the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. A multi-roomed Hellenistic building was excavated on the Georganta Petrakou property, south of the acropolis.</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 51 For the Roman period, the large number of rescue excavations undertaken over the past decade has revealed much regarding the domestic character of Roman Sparta; sumptuous villae urbani with mosaic floors, baths, workshops and sections of the city's hydraulic and sewage systems. The broader impact of these discoveries is discussed in the 'Roman Greece' section, but it is worth noting some of the particulars. Excavation of the Panagaki property and the adjacent Markou and Kourkouli plots revealed part of a large, luxurious villa urbana and a sanctuary deposit (Fig. 83). Seven rooms are preserved, plus part of the internal colon naded garden; several rooms had wall-paintings and all 79.

A deposit beneath the house contained miniature vessels, terracotta female protomes (rare in Sparta and probably from acrolithic figures) and terracotta figurines of kourotrophoi, symposiasts, standing male and female figures (naked and clothed) and Artemis as huntress, several of which bear the coroplast's signature. These finds suggest the existence in the area of a cult of Artemis from Archaic to Early Roman times. Part of another villa urbana discovered on the Katsari property (Fig. 84), has rooms arranged around a large courtyard. Both the rooms and the courtyard have floor mosaics with geometric motifs and figure scenes (Medusa and erotes riding dolphins). At Magoula (Nikolaros property), A. Themos, E. Zavvou (formerly 5th EPCA, now Epigraphical Museum), C. Pickersgill (Nottingham) and M. Tsouli (5th EPCA) conducted rescue excavations and published the recovered material (Themos et al. [2010]), which revealed architec tural remains connected with the second- to third-century AD Arapissa Baths immediately to the north of the plot (ID2549). These date initially to the second century, with some rearrangement made during the course of the third. In the fourth century a hall (10 x 8m) with an exedra on the southwest side and a mosaic floor was built over them. The central part of the mosaic was divided into eight panels with scenes from the palaestra. The structure is characterized as a teaching room in a gymnasium. Knowledge of Sparta's topography was further refined by the discovery of portions of two cemeteries on the boundaries of the Roman city, in the north and southwest. This latter cemetery was used from the Late Hellenistic period until the fifth century AD, but the majority of graves date to the second and third centuries AD. Rescue excavations, far from being the 'poor cousin' to research driven archaeology, are driving a refined understanding of the city's topography and history. More of the impact of Roman rule in southern Lakonia has been illuminated at Gytheion and Epidauros Limera. At Gytheion, the remains of the Hellenistic city wall (Fig. 85), a Roman bath and a public building of unclear function were recovered on the Kapasouri, Agrappidi and Vasilouni-Stathakou properties (ID2554). It is interesting to note the changing function of this area of the settlement - from defence to leisure. Shifting cultural norms can also be seen in the Roman period burials on the acropolis at Epidauros Limera (ID2556) and further south at Plytra (ancient Asopos), on the Venetsanaki-Vraimaki property. Here, E. Zavvou (formerly 5th EPCA, now Epigraphical Museum) and A. Maltezou (5th EPCA) uncovered a Roman columbarium containing multiple burials in successive levels. Most burials date to the first half of the second century AD, though there is some evidence of third- to fourth-century use (Zavvou and Maltezou [2010] 770-71; ID317). To the west in Arkadia, the funereal character of Hellenistic to Early Roman Mantineia was illuminated by the recovery by A. Karapanagiotou (Director, 39th EPCA) of 11 inhumations at Milia (Karali property) (ID2417). These burials are unusual in their wealth of offerings, with jewellery of gold and semi-precious stones, gold danakes and vases of special function with relief scenes. This picture of opulence, until now unusual in Arkadian</page><page sequence="52">52 DANIEL STEWART 81.

S. Fritzilas (39th EPCA) opened a series of test trenches at Pallantion (just south of Tripolis) in connection with the management of Lake Takka, which extend for ca. 500m along the north-south axis of the ancient city on the lower plain (ID2418). While Archaic to Byzantine occupation was evident, most pottery dated to the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Part of the city wall was traced close to the acropolis, complete with a destroyed tower - perhaps the result of Polyperchon's campaign of 318. A 24m-long stretch of the central arterial cobbled road (3.6^1.2m wide, with wheel ruts) ran east-west, parallel to the city wall. Beside it was a Hellenistic public stoa - a re shaped building with north and east wings forming an angle of the agora (the closed north wall faced onto the street). On the north side were foundations for a staircase to an upper storey. Remains of the roof included stamped tiles (some marked AAMOSIOS with a similar stamp to that used in the reroofing of Temple C on the acropolis) and an acroterion (ID2418; Fritzilas [2011] 125-34). Evidence suggests that the city wall fell out of use in the 84. Sparta, Katsari property: villa urbana. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 5th EPCA. ; * 85. Gytheion: Hellenistic city wall. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 5th EPCA. Roman period, though the public buildings of the city flourished. A relatively short distance away to the southeast, at Dollana, Kouphogi, a Roman period limestone quarry was discovered (ID2433). So while large-scale civic infrastructure projects like fortifications fell into abeyance in the Roman period, new sources of stone were still being sought, providing (in this area at least) an amendment to the decreasingly prevalent narrative of economic disinvestment.</page><page sequence="54">54 DANIEL STEWART To the west of Pallantion at Arachamitai, Agia Paraskevi, B. Forsén (Finnish Institute at Athens) undertook the second excavation season of a new five-year programme (ID2422). Between 2006 and 2008, a magne tometer survey and trial trenches at Agia Paraskevi located a Late Flellenistic rectangular building (RB I), connected to a Late Archaic to Late Flellenistic sanctuary, and a Middle Roman courtyard building (CYB) of unclear function. In 2010, portions of the rectangular building were excavated and 2011 's campaign continued and expanded this work. Rooms 1 and 4 were used for bathing (Fig. 86) and recovered pottery suggests RB I was built during the first half of the second century and destroyed during the last decades of the first century BC. The pottery also suggests the building had a connection to food preparation and consumption. Traces of an earlier building (with similar orientation and layout) were found beneath portions of rooms 1 and 4. No clear sign of cult activity was noted inside the building, although stamps on the roof tiles and a large quantity of broken figurines and miniature vessels indicate a connection to a sanctuary. Two different types of tile stamps were recovered (Fig. 87). The first suggests Âpxéptxoç AuKocmôoç ('belonging to Artemis Lykoatis'), the second Aéo7totvaçAK... ('belonging to Despoina AK...') (ID2422). Artemis appears with the topographical epithet Lykoatis only once, in Pausanias (8.36.5-8), in reference to the small Mainalian polis of Lykoa/Lykaia. The stamps seem to suggest that Lykoa/Lykaia was located at Agia Paraskevi of Arachamitai. If so, then the Arachamitai valley is to be identified with the valley of Mainalos and the Agios Elias mountain with Mount Mainalos. Southwest, at Megalopolis, traces of the Hellenistic city were uncovered by the 39th EPCA (ID2427). A public building ca. 200m south of the upper diazoma of the theatre koilon was uncovered, and appears to have been destroyed in the late third century BC. A Hellenistic house was uncovered on Sophokleous Street and Late Hellenistic graves were recorded on Lyktora and Kephala Streets (O.T. 237, Charalambopoulou property). It is worth pausing briefly to remark on the contrast between Sparta, Messene and Megalopolis. Messene is the site of a long-running research-driven archaeological project. The information on Megalopolis and Sparta comes largely from rescue excavations, with Sparta receiving much more detailed publication. Arguably, the breadth of infor mation coming from Sparta is equal to the depth of infor mation from Messene: two different techniques, focusing on different types of archaeology, providing comparably valuable information. At Megalopolis, however, despite the quality of excavation, the paucity of information allows us to say little more than what phases are represented. At Messene, P. Themelis (ASA) continues to excavate the Hellenistic n-shaped north stoa of the agora (ID2563; reports dating back to 2006 are available on AGOnline). It was revealed to be a two-storey building 186m long (Fig. 88). Instead of a series of regular internal divisions for shops were statue niches and two internal Corinthian colonnades, with a Doric façade. The upper storey had an internal Ionic colonnade and Doric half-columns on the exterior; many architectural fragments were recorded (Fig. 89). The lack of internal divisions and the presence of the colonnades are interesting, suggesting a more mixed-use structure than a purely commercial building. This adds nuance to our existing picture of the use of public space at Messene. 86.

Arachamitai: some examples of the roof tile stamps of RB I. © Finnish Institute at Athens. Southwest of Messene, on the Messenian Gulf at Petalidi (ancient Koroni), the 38th EPCA recovered evidence of extensive Roman habitation (ID2572). On the acropolis of Petalidi a large Late Roman building with floor mosaics was recovered, as were the foundations of houses or workshops and a Roman cemetery (Fig. 90), while at Loutro, 3.5km west of Petalidi, a complex of Roman buildings was found close to the known Late Roman bath. This complex includes further baths, furnaces for glass and metal-working, and a períbolos (Fig. 91). Perhaps most interesting was the discovery amongst the Roman buildings of a Classical structure, evidently curated and preserved as a monument in later times. More Roman period habitation in Messenia was uncovered on the Ionian coast at Mousga, Kyparissia (ID2568). A Roman villa with three construction phases (dating to the first century AD, third century AD and late fourth to early fifth century AD) was excavated. The extensive complex seems to be a villa urbana, with associated bath complex, located quite close to the agora (Fig. 92). Further rescue excavations along the shore revealed a sprawling maritime residential complex, occupied from the second century BC to the fourth century</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 55 AYTIKH JHEEYP o 7 8.

Finds such as anchors and hooks, and needles for sewing nets suggest that fishing was the main occupation of the inhabitants. Far to the north, in Elis, excavations of the Roman settlement at Skaiidia under O. Vikatou (Director, 7th EPCA) continued (ID2503). Remains of Roman buildings which formed part of an extensive planned settlement were found on two building plots, while on the western edge of the Skafidia wood, beside the lárdanos river delta, a large bath complex was explored. The bath complex forms part of a large public or private building in a prominent position and with a commanding view to the sea. The rich architec tural finds and material culture attest to the opulence of a complex which remained in use from the first to the fourth century AD. While the information is more extensive in character than systematic, it does appear that the character of Roman period settlement in the western Peloponnese is significantly different from that to be found in the east.</page><page sequence="56">56 DANIEL STEWART 92. Mousga, Kyparissia: possible villa urbana. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 38th EPCA. Key trends There is little need to repeat the caveats from last year's AR, but it is worth remembering that these overviews are necessarily selective and cursory. Much more detail can be found on the relevant entries at AGOnline, but, even so, it is difficult to tease out coherent regional narratives from data composed primarily of necessarily superficial rescue excavation reports. However, those broad trends identified last year still seem apparent to me in 2011-2012. There is a general paucity of information relating to the Archaic and Classical periods, and what does exist tends to relate to the recovery and study of religious structures, either at estab lished archaeological sites of long-standing interest (Isthmia, Nemea, Sikyon, Thouria and Olympia) or elsewhere (n.O.T.A. Romanou [Pylias], Ano Melpeia [Petroula], Prasidaki, the Mygdalia Hill [Patras]). Some of this is no doubt due to the nature of the archaeology: sanctuaries are recognizable and tend to have a long use life in antiquity, making them, perhaps, more durable. Similar reasons may account for the recovery of various stretches of fortification (Leonidio, Dimitsana, Triphyiia survey). Technique also drives the nature of the recovered archaeology: the depth of excavation, especially in rescue contexts, means that deep deposits - i.e. those most likely to have survived archaeologically - tend to be of a particular type. Many of the graves relating to this period (at Sparta, Argos, Corinth and Delpriza) were uncovered in advance of large-scale infrastructure projects that have radically reshaped significant stretches of the coastal Peloponnese. That being said, more direct traces of the economic life of Archaic and Classical inhabitants of the Peloponnese can be seen in the settlement at Perivolia, the potter's workshop at Tegea and the continued (re)study of the diolkos at Corinth. In contrast, the material from the Hellenistic and Roman periods represents a much more even balance between the rural and the urban, the secular and the sacred. My survey, of course, is not evenly divided in terms of chronology: the Hellenistic and Roman periods represent a longer slice of time. However, these periods also seem to form a larger component of diachronic research projects. This leads to a deeper understanding of the development of various poleis' urban topography (as at Corinth, Sparta, Argos, Gytheion, Pallantion, Megalopolis and Messene). You can even read, albeit coarsely, the different metaphysical landscapes of some of these settlements, the juxtaposition (and not infrequent close spatial relationship) of the living and the dead. The reports on Sikyon, Argos, Epidauros Limera, Plytra, Mantineia, Megalopolis and Petalidi perhaps support this, though one has to be careful not to read too much into short reports. What is clear is the broader and more specific recovery of the rural economy in these periods. At n.O.T.A. Romanou, Pylias a large Hellenistic rural settlement was excavated and at Triantaphyllia a large fourth- to third-century BC agricultural residence was recorded by the 7th EPCA (in association with a Mycenaean tholos tomb). Alongside the harbour at Aigeira, the quarry at Doliana and the settlements at Petalidi and Kyparissia, a much more nuanced under standing of regional economies is beginning to emerge, one that moves beyond the simplistic agricultural narrative of settlements reliant on the Mediterranean triad. These are nodes in broader networks, engaging in the full range of economic and industrial activities. Also in evidence are social networks, of a sort, based on wealth. The villae urbanae of Sparta and Kyparissia, and the extensive villa complexes at Petalidi and Skafidia speak to networks of wealthy citizens far removed from the fishing village of Kyparissia. So while that village was a node in a broader network of local and regional exchange (most likely, though perhaps I overreach), that network operated on a different plane to that which supported the villae. It will be interesting to watch the development of these excavations over time and see if points of interaction between these networks can be pin pointed. As I write this, I am sitting in the British Library in London, on the day after the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Olympics. One of the prevailing narratives of the run-up to these games has been that of legacy, and it strikes me that the issue of 'legacy' within Classical archaeology is seldom dealt with explicitly. An exception, of course, can be found in the activities of the Mount Lykaion Excavation and Survey Project (http://lykaionexcavation.org/; http://parrhasianher itagepark.org/en/) (ID2419). D.G.

Petropoulos (Director and Director Emeritus, 39th EPCA), in collaboration with A. Panagiotopoulou (Director Emérita, Archaeological Institute for Peloponnesian Studies), opened the first Parrhasian Heritage Park Field School in 2011. This field school explored a series of themes: how to agree the values or principles guiding a regional vision for the park; potential catalyst projects to serve park management groups; how to define, manage and accentuate landscape character, urban character, trails and sign design; and also gathering information on the history, geology and archae ology of the region. Here the legacy seems clear. Legacy of a different kind can be seen in the events at Olympia in the last year. The death of Nicholas Yalouris in November 2011 was an inestimable loss. Not only did he help set up the New Archaeological Museum of Olympia, he wrote extensively on the history and archae ology of the Olympics: The Olympic Games (Athens 1976); The Eternal Olympics: The Art and History of Sport (New Rochelle 1979); The Olympic Games in Ancient Greece: Ancient Olympia and the Olympic Games (Athens 1982); Ancient Elis: Cradle of the Olympic Games (Athens 1996); as well as numerous articles. He also had responsibility for many of the museums and archaeological projects in the western Peloponnese. Beyond that, he had interests in Hellenistic history, the reception of Greek myths in the art of the Renaissance and international outreach: indeed, he taught Greek sculpture in the American College Year Abroad Program from 1964-1973 and 1984-1995. His death represents a real loss to Greek archaeology, and the Peloponnese in particular, and while he published prolifically, the field is the lesser for his passing. His legacy is assured, but his passing also represents the passing of a different type of archaeology - the archae ology of the great synthesis. The explosion of archaeo logical data now available makes any sort of regional or inter-regional synthesis all the harder, while the spread of online resources democratizes access to what had been a previously privileged set of information. This information is not only useful for archaeologists and students of the Greek past, but also to those who seek to profit from the exploitation of that past. Last year I identified significant trends as being an increase in interdisciplinarity, an engagement with issues of scale, and a more critically aware approach to topog raphy. It was also observed that there was a softening of the distinctions between the various archaeological cultures of researchers in the region (AR 57 [2010-2011] 62). In a sense, this still holds true for research projects in 2011-2012, insomuch as the drive towards interdiscipli narity produces methodologies (and dataseis) that approach comparability, irrespective of the national origin of those projects. The differences between research-driven archaeology and rescue archaeology are well documented, and the contrast between the two approaches in respect to method ologies and outcomes is to be expected, if not welcomed. Rescue archaeology, by its nature, demands speed, an emphasis on description over interpretation and the skilful deployment of limited resources. The publication of the activities of the Archaeological Service is very much to be welcomed, and it highlights the impressive range of activ ities and skills of Ephoreia staff. It also highlights the incredible demands placed on those staff, demands that necessitate difficult choices with an important knock-on effect to our understanding of the past and the protection of Greece's cultural heritage. Without a doubt, this is a significant moment within Greek archaeology. The economic situation within Greece and the wider European Union region, and the dire forecasts for the future, have severe ramifications for the cultural heritage of Greece. The staff of the Archaeological Service face dwindling resources at a time when the risk to sites of historic interest is rising. This is an issue that is not confined to Greece, of course, but it is one which should provoke wider discussion of what the ethical and responsible approaches of researchers should be in the current economically and politically challenging climate prevailing across Europe. How those of us who work in Greek archaeology face up to these challenges will determine how knowledge is produced, disseminated and interrogated for at least a generation. That is a conver sation worth having. That is a legacy worth considering. In closing, however, I return to the opening of the Parrhasian Heritage Park. This long-term intervention to preserve an area of outstanding natural and cultural signif icance represents a model collaboration between the local communities, Greek planning professionals, the Mount Lykaion Excavation and Survey Project (ASCSA) and the 39th EPCA in Tripolis. A good omen for the future. Bibliography Fritzilas, S. (2011) Ή Αγορά του αρχαίου Παλλαντίου', in Α.

The next volume of ADelt for Crete is still not available, while publication of the second meeting on 'Archaeological Work on Crete' (AWiC), whose first volume made a major contribution to AR 56 (2009-2010), is still awaited (see AR 57 [2010-2011] 63). Just beginning to appear are e-offprints from the Tenth International Cretological Congress held in Chania in 2006 (see AR 53 [2006-2007] 96), some of which are summarized below. In the meantime, publication of the 11th International Cretological Congress held in Rethymnon in October 2011 is promised on-line; a substantial book of abstracts (11th International Cretological Congress, Rethymno, 21-27 October 2011, Abstracts [Rethymnon 2011]) was distributed to partici pants and is likely to be available in some specialist libraries, such as the BSA's. Next year's 'Archaeology in Greece' should draw on full publication of both the Tenth and 11th International Cretological Congresses, together with AWiC 2 and ADelt 56. Publications are not completely lacking, however, and as indicated in the Introduction the former Ministry of Culture and Tourism has produced a substantial volume, under the general editorship of Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki (Director General of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage), summarizing the work of all the Prehistoric and Classical and Byzantine Ephoreias over the decade 2000-2010 that goes some way to filling the gap in publication of ADelt (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes). Inevitably, the information is brief and selective, but key discoveries are noted, some of which have already been noted in previous issues of AR. Several volumes of conference publications have also appeared. Back to the Beginning (Schoep et al. [2011]) is an important collection of 15 papers examining the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods (EM-MMII) on Crete; they present both new data and new approaches, which, in general, tend to push 'complexity' back into the third millennium BC. Spanning the Prepalatial to the Early Iron Age is Prehistoric Crete: Regional and Diachronic Studies on Mortuary Systems (Murphy 2011), a collection of six papers on funerary practice most origi nally delivered at a colloquium at the 2007 Annual Meetings of the Archaeological Institute of America. A third conference publication, a collaboration between the Danish Institute in Athens and the Institute of Aegean Prehistory Study Center for East Crete, has a narrower chronological focus, but goes into much greater depth, devoting two volumes to LMIB pottery (Brogan and Hallager [2011]); each of the 16 substantive papers is followed by a short response. Finally, spanning both prehistoric and historical periods is ETEFA : The Archaeology of Houses and Households in Ancient Crete, a substantial Hesperia supplementary volume containing 38 papers ranging in date from Final Neolithic to the early Roman Empire (Glowacki and Vogeikoff-Brogan [2011]). The historical period is represented by a general book on the Roman province of Creta (Bechert 2011). Publications of two recent theses, one doctoral (Lowe Fri [2011]), one masters (McGowan [2011]), have also appeared: the first an experimental archaeology of Minoan double-axe production and use, the second an attempt to understand Minoan seal imagery, particularly at Agia Triada. Urban and rescue archaeology One of the points highlighted in www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes is the enormous contribution made by the Archaeological Service to the preservation and evaluation of archaeological remains threatened by urban or other development. This is particularly true in Crete's major cities. Publication in 2009 of a bilingual, extensively illustrated selection of the most significant urban archaeological discoveries in Chania (Kydonia; seeAR 56 [2009-2010] 195) makes this particu larly clear and also serves as a guide to the archaeology, much of which remains visible thanks to creative architec tural solutions to the problem of preserving heritage in an urban environment (see also ID2004, ID2832-39, ID2841^12, ID2844,11)2846^19. ID2851-53). In general, the publication further emphasizes the fact that habitation and other activities in antiquity concentrated in the same regions as the Venetian to Ottoman city, on the Kastelli Hill and immediately east in the lower-lying Splantzia area, south and east of the harbour (Fig. 93).

The heart of the prehistoric settlement has been excavated in the Plateia Aikaterinis plot, originally as a rescue excavation from 1964, then as a systematic excavation by a Greek-Swedish team since 1970 (Kydonia 32^13; cf. AR 15 [1968-1969] 37-38 and regularly since). Habitation there began in EMU and all prehistoric periods are represented; most recently further discoveries were made when a protective roof was installed over the excavation area, with funding from the Third Community Support Programme (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 321; Kydonia 32—43). Urban excavations have uncovered Prepalatial (EMII-MMIA) remains at five other locations south of the Kastelli and extending to the southeast for almost 500m: at Karaoli and Demetriou and Katre Streets (Kydonia 56-61; cf. AR 53 [2006-2007] 118-19; ID273); at three locations on Daskalogianni Street (no. 63: Kydonia 70-77; cf. AR 42 [1995-1996] 47; AR 44 [1997-1998] 123; within the church of Agios Rokkos: Kydonia 78-85; and at no. 2: Kydonia 86-95); and at the</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 59 R9 „ v- ^ \ 94.

Venizelou and Michelidaki Streets (Kydonia 96-107; ID1851). These suggest that the Minoan town was already of some size in the mid- to late third millennium BC. There is less specifically Protopalatial (MMIB-II) material, even in Plateia Aikaterinis, where later constmction has removed it: finds, but no architecture in the church of Agios Rokkos (Kydonia 78-85), and clearer evidence of structures at 15-17 Kanevaro Street (Kydonia 44-49) and 10 Katre Street (Kydonia 50-55). Neopalatial (MMIII-LMIB) structures, some quite substantial, have been revealed above Protopalatial remains at the previous three sites and at Karaoli and Demetriou and Katre Streets (.Kydonia 56-61; cf. AR 53 [2006-2007] 118-19; ID273), 43 Kanevaro Street (Kydonia 62-69) and 63 Daskalogianni Street (Kydonia 70-77), where an important Late Minoan complex, including high-status architectural features such as a lustral basin (with painted pillar) and Minoan halls, was uncovered. This complex was in use throughout the Neopalatial period, undergoing the refurbishments necessi tated by earthquake damage. More recent excavations to the north of 10 Katre Street, in the 'Sevach' plot, have uncovered more Neopalatial structures with two construction phases, MMIII and LMIB (AR 53 [2006—2007] 118-19). At 1 Katre Street, almost adjacent to the Karaoli and Demetriou plot, excavations (ID 1855) (Fig. 94) revealed two Linear A-inscribed objects (see below) in debris redeposited in a 13th-century BC destruction here that also included a fragment of Linear B tablet (see below). All of the preceding Neopalatial sites also produced LMIII material, suggesting a general destruction in the mid-13th century BC (LMIIIB1). Material of LMIIIC to Geometric date is less plentiful, but there are LMIIIC levels in Plateia Aikaterinis, at 15-17 Kanevaro Street and 10 Katre Street, and a preserved hearth in the church of Agios Rokkos (Kydonia 82), while Geometric material was deposited in pits in the 'Chania Bank' plot (Kydonia 104) about 300m further to the south southeast. This plot, together with the nearby excavation at 2 Daskalogianni Street (Kydonia 84), where Archaic to Classical habitation gave way to a Hellenistic ceramic workshop area, and a fourth-century BC pit in Agios Rokkos (Kydonia 84), document urban habitation in ancient Kydonia from the Archaic to the Roman periods. The centre probably remained, like its Minoan prede cessor, on and around the Kastelli hill, where remains of the historical fortifications lie beneath the Venetian walls along the south edge of the hill (Kydonia 22). It is probable that the 'Chania Bank' site was close to the southeastern edge of the city, since remains of a Hellenistic city wall including spolia were found a short distance to the southeast of the site (Kydonia 104); to the south it is likely that the edge of habitation lay near Plateia Kolokotronis (cf. AR 53 [2006-2007] 119). Further excavation to the south and west of the ancient centre revealed habitation spanning the eighth century BC to Roman periods in the 'Agricultural Bank' plot at the junction of Skalidi and Manoussogiannakidou Streets, ca. 600m southwest of the Kastelli, and Hellenistic to Roman workshops (including murex-processing facilities) (Fig. 95) at a similar distance west-southwest at 32-34 95.

The first of these is particularly interesting, since it was used for burial in the Archaic period, before becoming a Classical to Hellenistic suburb, bisected by an east-west running beaten-earth road, and finally continuing as an industrial quarter in the Roman period with two transport amphora kilns (Kydonia 186-95; cf.AR 53 [2006-2007] 117-18). The prehistoric and historical period cemeteries of Kydonia extended for up to a kilometre beyond the edge of the ancient city, especially to the southeast, following the modern streets of A. Papandreou and Apokoronas with a concentration in the Dikasteria-Mazali area. Chamber tombs are predominant in the LMII-IIIB periods, attested at 83 and 86—88 A. Papandreou Street (Kydonia 114-27), at 11 Malinou Street {Kydonia 172-79), with a particular concentration immediately south and east of the church of Agioi Petros kai Pavlos, and at 69-71 and 73-77 Igoumenou Gavriel Street (Kydonia 152-71). The latter comprised a group of 60 tombs, 54 prehistoric (the rest Hellenistic) spanning LMII to LMIIIB and showing similarities to contemporary examples at Rnossos (AR 57 [2010-2011] 68). Classical and Hellenistic tombs are widespread, extending from Peace and Friendship Park, where a few Subminoan, Late Geometric and mid-second century AD tombs were also found {Kydonia 103-13), to the region immediately west of the Law Courts (Dikasteria) at 31 and 31a G. Hatzidaki Street and at 9 Renieri Street {Kydonia 128-51) (Fig. 96), where a group of fourth- to third-century BC loculus tombs was found. Finally, an elaborate Roman funerary structure {ca. 110m2 in area) with niches and arcosolia, originally located by N. Platon in 1958, was fully excavated at 161 Apokoronou Street. It may date late in the Roman period, and four rock-cut and two tile graves of the second to third century AD were also found a short distance away to the north {Kydonia 180-85). To the west of Chania, the urban layout of the small city of Kissamos has been extensively revealed in the course of remodelling, again with assistance from the Third Community Support Programme: sections of the Roman street system, rich houses with mosaic floors, bath complexes, industrial establishments, large storehouses, central aqueducts and tombs, rich and poor. Also, a new museum now houses finds from the city and region (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 323; cf. ID1862, ID1863; AWiC 1.19). Only 3-4km further west, along the small coastal plain, tourist development at Viglia Kalyviani and Phournado have produced valuable results. At Viglia, a Middle Minoan establishment was investigated, the finds from which included clay rhyta in the form of feline heads (ID2807). At Phoumado an agricultural establishment with multiple phases commencing in the Roman period was located; facilities for the production and storage of wine and oil were features of the complex (ID2796). Near the east edge of the Kissamos coastal plain is the important Minoan and later site of Nopigela, possibly ancient Methymna (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 323; cf. AR 43 [1996-1997] 121-23). East of Chania, rescue excavations on the edge of the modern settlement on the west edge of the site of ancient Aptera have revealed around 150 tombs of various periods, some with rich offerings of clay vessels, figurines, coins and jewellery (ID216; www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes 323). The Third Community Support Programme also contributed to regeneration of the site: the entire fortification (ca. 4km in length) has been cleaned, revealing élite tombs at the western wall, together with the main western entrance. The ancient theatre (Fig. 97), much damaged in post-Roman times, has been cleared and studied, and a section of road running southeast, perhaps towards the city's eastern gate, uncovered ((ID1870); www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 323-24). Immediately below Aptera, to the east, in the vicinity of the village of Kalami, rescue excavations resulting from road improvement revealed a LMII tomb at the site of Koiliari (ID1869), only ca. 150m northwest of a similar tomb, containing a memorable clay pyxis depicting a lyre-player, excavated by Y. Tzedakis in the late 1960s (cf. AR 20 [1973-1974] 41). About 600m to the northeast excavations occasioned by the development of a beach complex at Kyani Akti revealed a Late Roman wine production and distribution facility (ID2771), while rescue excavations also uncovered a Hellenistic farmhouse (overlying Late Classical remains) about 1km west along the coast (ID1871). Rescue excavations south of modern Rethymnon, at the sites of Agia Eirini and Alpha Mnemata, have revealed important new information. At Agia Eirini, just over 3km south of the modern city, a Hellenistic settlement of early third- to late second-century BC date was revealed in a series of four excavation areas (ID1839). Road widening at Mnemata, south of the village of Alpha, uncovered 128 cist tombs, predominantly of Hellenistic date that belong to the north cemetery of Eleutherna, whose city centre lies l-2km further south (ID2771, ID269) (Fig. 98). These form part of a larger cemetery that extends south, on the west side of a steep gorge, 96.

In addition to abundant ceramic finds and coins, the earliest dating to the late fourth to early third centuries BC, were two inscribed gold mouth-covers (tombs 56 and 84), similar to those recovered from tombs at Sphakaki, near Pangalochori and the coast ca. 8km northwest (ID2803). Work also continued in the systematic excavations of the earlier cemetery at Orthi Petra Eleutherna (ID2857, cf. ID2005). An oversized pithos containing four inhuma tions (a 60-70-year-old male, accompanied by an iron dirk and an iron brooch with textile traces, followed by three females aged 35-42, about 30 and 19) was investigated under Late Hellenistic to Early Roman settlement remains. The pithos had two bronze basins placed on top of it, with a third nearby, while pots (kraters, amphorae, hydriae, lekythoi and skyphoi in Cretan, Creto-Cypriot and Cypro Phoenician style) were packed tightly outside it. More iron weapons with these finds probably accompanied an eighth-century BC inurned male cremation (aged 28-35). Nearby a chamber tomb contained remains of armed males deposited between 900 BC and the beginning of the seventh century BC. The area on and near the coast to the east of modern Rethymnon has been described as the greatest centre for tourism in the region, while also being the most significant area of prehistoric settlement (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 325). The city of Rethymnon itself, while enormously significant in the Venetian and Ottoman periods (ID2793 for how recent work has enhanced our knowledge of these periods in the city), seems not to have been a focus of ancient settlement, despite the recent discovery for the first time of a Hellenistic structure within the Fortetza (ID J 840) and remains of Hellenistic shipsheds on its slope, partly destroyed by the modern road encircling the Fortetza (AWiC 1.21). Urgent rescue excavations to the east of the city have contributed to our knowledge of both prehistoric and historical activity in this region. In the area of Chamalevri, concentrated on the hills of Kakavella and Tsikouriana, are remains spanning all Minoan periods from MMIA to LMIIIC, the latter including deposits of ritual character and a ceramic kiln (ID1826; cf. AR 51 [2004-2005] 116). Excavation also revealed an extensive and well-preserved Roman olive-oil workshop at the Manouses location (Figs 99,100). There were remains of two crushing mills (mola olearia) of a type introduced late in the first century BC, plus a domed millstone from a crusher (tropeion) typical of the Late Classical to Early Hellenistic period, as well as three pulp presses, storage facilities and a nearby amphora kiln (not excavated). About 80% of the ceramic finds within the structure were amphorae, mostly Cretan, but with some imported (possibly from Tunisia) in its earlier phase. The establishment, perhaps forming part of an industrial quarter, either belonged to a community or to a nearby shrine and had two phases of use: second to third century AD (construction and main use) and third to late fourth or early fifth century AD (south room). The destruction was by earthquake (probably one of those documented for the early fifth century AD), which also destroyed a bath complex to the north. Roman cist cemeteries were also documented northwest of the complex. A second-century BC public inscription was found in secondary context in the remains of the complex (ID2828; Zeitschrift jur Papyrologie und Epigraphik 157 [2006] 87-94 for the inscription). Close to this group of finds is the cemetery stretching between the villages of Sphakaki and Stavromenos comprising 38 Hellenistic and Roman tombs of various types: 15 tile graves, 25 simple cists, seven built cists and one pit (ID2803; AR 57 [2010-2011] 69; ID211). 99.

Near Pigi, an isolated LMIIIA2-B chamber tomb was excavated at the Sounatsos location (ID1828), while a unique group of 16 MMI pithos burials was excavated at Choiroi (ID212). These are perhaps associated with the settlement at Chamalevri, which lies only l-2km to the east. Slightly further west, a cemetery of 14 chamber tombs has been excavated over the past decade near Maroulas at the Mezaria location (ID2825; AR 53 [2006-2007] 114); ten of the tombs lie in a row, with others to their west and pithos burials to the east. Finds include ceramics (spanning the LMIIIA1-2 to LMIIIB period), 17 clay larnakes, beads and 11 sealstones, mostly carnelian and steatite. Further similar tombs have also been located near Adele (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 325). Unfortunately many of these LMIII tombs had been looted in the recent past. Tombs also continue to be discovered further east towards Perama in the area of Angeliana (cf. AR 31 [1990-1991] 76; AR 41 [1994-1995] 71), including the recent discovery by E. Kapranos (25th EPCA) of a LMIII 'cave tomb' containing larnakes (ID2770). Further east still, in the inland areas behind the Kouloukonas mountains, at Kryoneri, rescue excavation by M. Pateraki (25th EPCA) continued on a Middle Minoan building with seven rooms, two of which have been excavated to bedrock, revealing four pithoi (ID2778). Urban archaeology in modern Herakleion, Greece's fourth largest city, has elucidated the Byzantine to Ottoman layout of the city, successor in Late Antiquity to Knossos (ID1810). For some time now, the modem city has been expanding in all directions, coming up against the archaeo logical zone protecting its ancient predecessor to the south. One of the goals of the Knossos Urban Landscape Project (KULP) was to document remains in the northern part of the larger city site where they were most threatened by development (ID2815). Study of material, reported by T. Whitelaw (BSA/UCL) and A. Vasilakis (for the 23rd EPCA), from the three seasons of archaeological survey (http://www.bsa.ac.uk/pages/media_drill. php?cat_id=93&amp;media_id=IT2012_18.mp4) continued in 2011, focusing on a review of units collected in 2007-2008, outside the urban core area (Figs 101, 102). Among significant patterns emerging are: probable Middle Minoan (in addition to documented Late Minoan) occupation in the suburb on the Ailias ridge, plus a previ ously undocumented concentration on the northwestern point of Ailias; further evidence for Middle to Late Minoan cemeteries on the west slope of Ailias, as well as possible evidence for Late Minoan use of cemeteries on the Kephala ridge, modem Agios Ioannis, to the east and north of the North Cemetery, immediately south of the Zapher Papoura cemetery and on the west slope of Lower Gypsades, all awaiting confirmation on the basis of vessel forms repre sented. Although LMII-III material is less diagnostic, it does appear that habitation on Ailias does not continue in this period. Restudy offers further confirmation of a nucleated Early Iron Age settlement, rather than a series of dispersed hamlets. Resistivity survey in January 2011 on Lower Gypsades, reported by J. Bennet (Sheffield/BSA), E. Hatzaki (Cincinnati) and A. Bogaard (Oxford), focused on selected areas within the overall geophysical study area (ID2813, ID1921) (Fig. 103). In Area 1 (Fig. 104), indica tions appeared of a possible unpaved north-south roadway running for about 90m, before disappearing under a modern structure, perhaps leading to the gypsum quarries at the southern boundary of the study area; the quarries themselves may have been more extensive than they now appear, according to the resistivity survey. In Area 3, it is likely that a series of structures on terraces existed, continuing those already documented as Hogarth's Houses since 1900. I also note the welcome publication of Early Minoan material from the Royal Road excavations at Knossos (Hood and Cadogan [2011]). Rescue excavations revealed tombs in several locations. South of Herakleion proper, in the Ambelokipi-Tekke area, part of the larger Knossos North Cemetery (Fig. 105), a series of Protogeometric to Orientalizing tombs was revealed in 2010 by M. Rousaki (23rd EPCA): two chamber tombs, 17 pits and 12 irregular cists, mostly containing jar cremations, with only one inhumation. Finds included abundant ceramics spanning the Late Geometric to the end of the Orientalizing period, as well as bronze vessels and brooches, iron blades and fire dogs, a silver pin, glass, faience and rock-crystal beads; finds were less abundant in the pits and cists (ID2804) (Fig. 106). In the well-known Neopalatial chamber tomb cemetery at Poros near the coast, a tenth tomb was found in 2002 by N. Dimopoulou-Rethemiotaki (Herakleion Museum), the smallest yet (at 55m2). It had been disturbed, the bones pushed to the chamber walls, but produced fineware ceramics, plus an ivory plaque, two gold signet rings with epiphany scenes and a gold amulet in the form of a basket (ID2797) (Fig. 107). On the south western outskirts of Herakleion, road works on the Gazi Krousonas road, led to excavation by the 23rd EPCA of a LMIIIA/B chamber tomb containing multiple burials, a large clay lamax, many fineware vessels, gold jewellery and bronze objects, including weapons (ID2858). To the east of Herakleion, the next major coastal city is Limen Chersonessos, where rescue excavations in the polis area conducted between 1991 and 2010 by K. Galanaki (23rd EPCA) have uncovered 150 tombs (including two horse burials) in the Late Classical and Early Hellenistic cemetery that lies below Roman and Early Christian occupation (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 312-13; cf. ID191, ID1805). Most tombs are pit graves, occasionally covered with terracotta or stone slabs, but there are a few terracotta-lined cists. A broad range of black- and red-figure ceramics has been recovered (Fig. 108), plus jewellery, strigils, mirrors and possible bronze shoe buckles. Perhaps to be associated with Chersonessos and lying to the west, on a hilltop known as Kephala ca. 3km northeast of the village of Skopela between the Patsidianos and Ai Giannis (Chourmalis) streams, N. Panagiotakis reports the remains of a substantial structure (the foundations of the west wall are 52m long), probably the central building of a sanctuary complex dated by associated surface finds to the Archaic to Hellenistic period (ID2854) (Fig. 109). It is suggested that this might be the Sanctuary of Artemis Skopelitis, at the borders of the city-states of Knossos, Lyktos and Chersonessos, referred to in an inscription found by N. Platon at Fortetsa near Knossos (Platon [1948]). A few kilometres south of Chersonessos, in the Aposelemis river valley, construction of a dam led to investigation by M. Mavraki-Balanou (23rd EPCA) of an important Minoan site at the Kephali location near the</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 63 WWmt1 i.\ }i\ rjr^J \yj \} \\ \ } jy ®afiy jCo// ■ "y &gt; / rr I mmmr^jwwwm (lv&gt;\» I 1/ J 'K \ W ^ \V S jf /7~&gt; &gt;*7 I/O n\\ K\) K' r 7( 4fiyiiWL o )• AVwxy r YV\ •• 7 imMMLW / N \ v \ () °\ e 0 \\, \ Ui\v\Yi 'TP*™1 BP: x5\- twm '-T ' "1 .1. r*~^\ / J*.

The site's main phase of occupation is MMIII-LMI and 52 rooms have been revealed, some substantial, including living and ritual spaces as well as three large storerooms. Construction was mostly in local limestone, with evidence for mud-brick upper walls in some rooms. Earlier use is demonstrated by the discovery under the structure of 24 (to date) Final Neolithic to Early Minoan burials, while there is also evidence of reoccupation in LMIII and some Archaic ceramics, mostly pithoi (ID2786). Tourist development in the vicinity of Agios Nikolaos, particularly to the northwest at modern Elounda, has obscured much of the ancient remains associated with the city-states of ancient Olous and Lato Pros Kamara. Material still comes to light, however, and V. Zographaki (24th EPCA) notes the excavation of a Minoan settlement at Alevriko, very close to modern Agios Nikolaos. The site produced architectural remains, Late Minoan ceramics, stone tools, loomweights, shell, bone and obsidian (ID2765). Test excavations, also by V. Zographaki, on the hill of Sarakinou Kephala, a known Minoan site, produced architectural remains of the Hellenistic and Roman periods, as well as ceramics of the MMI-II and LMIIIC periods (ID2800). Cist and pit burials have been excavated in various plots in Agios Nikolaos itself and nearby Elounda, but for the first time vaulted tombs of Roman date have been discovered by V. Zographaki in the Schisma cemetery associated with ancient Olous; the largest tomb incorporates funerary inscriptions from earlier tombs (ID2777). These tombs resemble similar examples found in rescue excavations in the Loutres area west of the modern city of Ierapetra, which, like Chania, overlays the remains of its ancient predecessor, Hierapytna (ID2790) (Fig. 111). According to V. Apostolakou (24th EPCA), 56 tombs have been inves tigated to date, 12 belonging to the single-chamber, vaulted type. Finds included ceramic and glass vessels dating to the second to third century AD and lamps spanning the mid-first to the late third century; in addition, 110.

On the north side of the Ierapetra isthmus, rescue excavations in the region of Pacheia Aminos by M. Tsipopoulou (Director, National Archive of Monuments) have revealed a series of at least two EMI houses at the site of Chalepa on the coast (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 318); this adds to the picture emerging from a number of excavations in the immediate area (cf. AR 55 [2008-2009] 81-82; noting especially ID767, ID768), well contextualized by archaeological surveys of the Kavousi, Gournia and Vrokastro areas. Ancient cities and post-prehistoric archaeology Crete is, of course, famously the island of 90 or 100 cities, according to the Classical tradition. Archaeological activity over the past decade continues to shed light on a considerable number of these. As we have seen, our appreciation of the urban layouts of ancient Kydonia, modern Chania, Kissamos and Aptera has been enriched through extensive salvage excavations necessitated by development, while at Knossos survey has contributed to similar goals. At Phalasarna, on the far west coast, after excavations in the 1990s (cf. AR 45 [1998-1999] 124), small-scale investigations of the ancient harbour installa tions continued in the last decade (www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes 323). At Elyros, on the southwest coast, test excavations continue and have revealed a theatre building of the Roman period (ID2801). In addition, study of the region's fortifications resulted in the location to the west of Elyros itself of four fourth-century BC towers, constructed in polygonal masonry, at the locations Vlithias, Azogyres, Spaniakos and Anydroi, between the inland village of Vlithias and Palaiochora on the coast. These had already been noted by ^""-century travellers (for example, Pashley [1837] 2.120-22). In the Rethymna nomos, various cities have been further investigated, including Eleutherna, already noted above. About 15km southwest of modern Rethymnon, habitation levels and tombs of the Roman period were revealed at Lappa (modern Argyroupolis) (www.yppo. gr/0/anaskafes 325; cf. ID1836, ID2772), while extensive investigations, including geophysics, at Axos, 35km to the southeast, significantly improved knowledge of this important city's overall layout (ID1834). In the Amari region to the south, a small settlement on a high plateau looking both north and south at the north end of the valley, variously identified with ancient Bene or Phalanna, was investigated at Veni (ID1845). Archaeological investiga tions over three decades at the city of ancient Sybrita, about 4km east of Veni as the crow flies, on the Kephala hill above the modern village of Thronos, are summarized by N. Karamaliki (25th EPCA) (ID2855). The city origi nated in the LMIIIC period, continuing through the Early Iron Age (periods under investigation by a joint Greek Italian team: cf. ID1847), but the report emphasizes the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Part of the isodomic Hellenistic fortification wall has been identified at the east foot of the Kephala hill, while in the same period habitation extended as far as the nearby village of Agia Photeini, ca. 800m to the southwest; further east a third- to second-century BC Hellenistic structure appears to have been associated with agricultural and textile production. The city reached its greatest extent in the Roman period, with a sanctuary on the summit of the hill, which produced a dedicatory inscription to Hermes, and was probably destroyed and abandoned in the third or fourth century AD. Ceramics and building debris are widely attested on the south slope of the hill and Roman structures, with building phases from the first to third century AD, were excavated on two plots in the village of Agia Photeini. The city boundaries were defined by tombs, such as those in the village of Genna, ca. 1km to the south, while an elaborate monumental tomb, approached by a 4-m long dromos with a domed chamber in opus testaceum, in use from the first to the third century AD, was found at Tsingouna on the north of the Kephala hill. Neither Gortyn, nor Phaistos, its smaller neighbour only 12km to the west, were built over after antiquity, leaving them open for modem study for over a century now. A five-year collaborative programme of research (ID1917) between the SAIA and the 23rd EPCA to inventory, map and restudy monuments of all periods in the vicinity of Phaistos completed its final season in 2011. F. Longo (Salerno/SAIA) reports that work focused on the area outside the Hellenistic walls on the highest point of the main ridge of Christos Efendi and on georeferencing nearby monuments, such as the Kalyvia, Liliana and Kamilari tombs (ID2821). Geomorphological studies were also undertaken. At Gortyn, excavation continued for a seventh season at the Pythion Theatre, reported by J. Bonetto (Padua/SAIA) (ID2818), confirming its construction in the first half of the second century AD, while it seems to have been destroyed in the AD 365 earth quake, by which time it appears to have been used as a stable. E. Lippolis (Rome/SAIA) offers a summary based on investigations to 2005 of development in the Pythion area from the Hellenistic (the emphasis of the paper) to the Byzantine period (ID2829). Gortyn emerged as a major power in Crete, with links to Ptolemaic Egypt, in the third to first century BC and this is reflected in extensive urban remodelling, especially in the second century BC. Work near the Nymphaeum, also reported by E. Lippolis, was directed at understanding the architectural history of a quarter created in the last decades of the third century BC (ID2819). Excavations by the SAIA in the agora at Gortyn have been published (di Vita and Rizzo [2011]). The 23rd EPCA excavated at the Grand Theatre, eluci dating its architectural layout (18 rows of seats in the lower cavea, 11 in the upper with five passageways giving access to the cavea) and recovering a life-sized stone male statue and 50 intact first- to second-century AD lamps (ID2859). Some 2-3km west of Gortyn itself, near the village of Kastelli, work on the new Herakleion-Moires road uncovered a Roman rural villa with mosaic floors, marble inlays and a pair of marble column bases, as well as evidence for oil or wine production; it was in use for a long time into the Early Christian period (ID2814). The city of Prinias, whose ancient name is not certain, although Rhizenia is a possibility, continues to provide more information (ID2843). The site is particularly important for its early origins in LMIIIC, rather like Sybrita on the other side of the Ida massif. Investigation in 2002 and 2005, reported by A. Pautasso (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Catania/SAIA), has shed consid erable light on the relationship of both Temple A and B to their urban surroundings, while soundings within the north part of the pronaos of Temple A revealed a stratigraphy with Late Geometric to Early Orientalizing ceramics in the upper part, over Protogeometric B to Geometric, in mm over LMIIIC at the base. The Protogeometric B to</page><page sequence="68">68 JOHN BENNET Geometric material may have been a ritual deposit, while the LMIIIC contained cooking ware. A similar sequence was documented in a sounding between the hearth and the south wall of the temple, where again the Protogeometric B material had a ritual character and the LMIIIC yielded drinking and cooking vessels as well as bones and seeds. Also in 2002 Early Iron Age cremation and inhumation burials in a funerary enclosure were excavated at Agioi Dodeka Apostoloi (Fig. 112), ca. 250m north of the known cemetery at Siderospilia, according to G. Biondi (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Catania/SAIA) (ID2826). The enclosure (2.6 x 2.4m) is similar to other examples at Prinias and elsewhere on Crete in this period. At present it is unclear whether these burials go with Prinias, or perhaps with another closer settlement, such as that currently dated only to the Hellenistic to Roman period at Kali Vrysi, another 300m north of the cemetery at Agioi Dodeka Apostoloi. A collaborative programme between the EfA and the 24th EPCA for the restudy of old material together with targeted fieldwork at the city-state sites of Dreros and Lato, plus the early site of Anavlochos, commenced in 2008 (ID771, ID772, ID908). This promises to shed new light on all three sites. In addition to this initiative, recent excavation, funded by the community of Vrachasi and carried out by V. Zographaki (24th EPCA), at Anavlochos, which lies across three summits and the saddles in between, revealed structures in two areas: Area A, below hills 1 and 2; and B, on hill 2 (ID2769). Two groups of tombs investigated at Mermingas at the northern foot of the hills produced ceramic and metal finds (www.yppo.gr/ O/anaskafes 319). In the Siteia region, recent work has taken place at the city-state of Praisos, on the First Acropolis, both by the BSA (ID255, ID1794) and by the 24th EPCA (ID1795). About 8km to the northeast, the site of Roussa Ekklesia Kastri {cf. AR 39 [1992-1993] 79) that lay within the territory of Praisos was investigated by C. Sophianou (24th EPCA): the previously discovered fortification wall was shown to have 11 watch-towers and structures within it occupied from the Archaic to Roman period, confirmed by ceramics and two inscriptions recovered in the past (ID2799). About 2km further east is the sanctuary site of Anoixi, perhaps forming a boundary shrine for the city state of Praisos {cf. AR 37 [1990-1991] 76; Erickson [2009] 378-85). At ancient Itanos a new five-year programme of research was initiated by A. Tsingarida (ULB) and D. Viviers (Belgian School/ULB) to complete work on the North Cemetery, carry out conservation work on the site and document the plan and function of the 'Archaic Building' (ID2822) (Fig. 113). Excavation in the North Cemetery revealed a very different picture from earlier work: it was arranged around a north-south path, with densely-packed Late Classical to Late Hellenistic tombs on the east and a series of structures, including the 'Archaic Building', to the west. An Early Roman retaining wall covered the north-south path at a point in time when the cemetery area was abandoned and used for cultivation. The wall was also picked up at the southern edge of excavations around the 'Archaic Building', which was shown to have three phases: an earlier Archaic phase (earlier than previously thought), a main seventh- to fifth century BC phase (in which a main room with hearth and pastas were identified) and a Classical phase. S. 112. Agioi Dodeka Apostoloi: view of funerary enclosure after excavation. © SAIA. Kirkpatrick Smith (Kennesaw/ASCSA) and C. Sophianou (24th EPCA) studied remains from three disturbed Hellenistic graves (T. 3, 6 and 7) excavated in the North Cemetery in 2003 within an area also containing four Geometric to Archaic cremations (ID2779). T. 3 contained the remains of a woman and was dated no later than the late second century BC on the basis of an inscription; T. 6 held at least four individuals, three adults (including a 50-year-old male and a woman over 35 years of age) and a five to seven-year-old child; T. 7 contained at least three adults and produced a late second- to early first-century BC amphora sherd. The general area of these tombs seems to have been in use from the Geometric to Hellenistic period with no restrictions on the basis of age or sex for those buried. Finally, it is worth noting two sites that might have become independent city-states had it not been for the presence of more powerful neighbours: Anavlochos and Azoria. That they are known by their modern names is significant. Both were important in the Geometric to Archaic period. Excavation concluded at Azoria in 2006 (ID184), but study continues under the direction of D. Haggis (Chapel Hill/ASCSA) and M. Mook (Iowa State/ASCSA), most recently focusing on structures origi nally investigated by H. Boyd in 1900 on the South 113.

The earlier tower may be associated with Praisos' territorial interests in response to the expansion of Hierapytna, while the later tower might have been established by Hierapytna to mark control over the north isthmus. Study of ceramics concentrated on understanding the chronology of the site's Archaic rebuilding and fifth-century BC occupation. News round-up Recent significant finds and publications It is worth collecting other recent significant finds and publications. These are organized from west to east. Excavations at the Minoan peak sanctuary of Vrysinas south of Rethymnon continue under the direction of E. Papadopoulou (25th EPCA) and 1. Tzachili (Crete) (ID2817). Material spans the Protopalatial to the first part of the Neopalatial period, and was found on a series of terraces in the vicinity of the church of Agio Pnevma. Clay vessels and figurines were plentiful (ca. 800 figurines to date), many pushed into crevices or hollows in the rock. The largest terrace, the site of earlier excavations by C. Davaras in 1972-1973, produced male and female figurines, both whole and partial, animal figurines and plaques depicting birds and double axes, as well as clay spheres; bronze objects were also found, including a single bronze figurine. From the same terrace came a four-sided prism seal in red jasper with Cretan Hieroglyphic signs on all four faces (VRYS 4/4 01: see Hallager et al. [2011]). Only a few kilometres due west of Vrysinas lies the major LMIII cemetery at Armenoi, whose associated settlement site is now being explored at the Kastello location to its west (ID210). In the middle of the Amari valley, the important Protopalatial site of Monastiraki has been excavated in recent years by A. Kanta (23rd EPCA), who has just produced a second volume of the site publication, focusing on the important 'administrative' building (Kanta [2012]). High up on the opposite side of the Ida massif, excavations at the site of Zominthos continue under E. Sapouna-Sakellaraki (ASA) (ID2810). In 2011, attention focused on the central building, rooms 19, 28-30 and 49. Among the finds from room 49 was a clay sealing. Clearance of a Roman addition over rooms 29 and 30, claimed to be a central court in LMI, revealed Geometric and Archaic interventions, as well as ceramics of the Classical, Hellenistic, Byzantine and Venetian periods. After removal of this later material and of the LMIA destruction level, a Protopalatial building was revealed, probably with two storeys. In the coastal area between Rethymnon and Herakleion, Hellenistic settlement remains with more than one phase and a small road were revealed at Perama (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 325-26). In the vicinity of the coastal village of Bali, two new sites were revealed, as E. Papadopoulou and E. Kopranos (25th EPCA) report (ID2774). At Sidero, a LMII1B structure may represent an early 'flight to the hills', typical of the end of the period in Crete, while a Middle Minoan building complex was excavated on the low hill of Katevatis near the sea (Fig. 114). The latter shows similarities with the known site of Pera Galinoi (ID1832) and may be one of a series of such establishments between Bali and Sises about 8km to the east, possibly connected with exploitation of mineral resources in the area. S. Mantilaki (23rd EPCA) reports the excavation in 2004 of an unrobbed LMIIIA2/B chamber tomb at Karteros Agia Photeini (Fig. 115), ancient Amnisos, not far from the Palaiochora hill and the cave of Eleithyia, and also near the Mapheze tomb of the same date excavated by S. Marinatos in the 1920s (ID2831). The tomb, approached by a 3m-long dromos, contained five clay larnakes, each containing a single inhumation, except for one with three, including a child. Finds were typical of the period, including ceramics, bronze vessels and glass beads. Lying some way inland on the Karteros river is the important site of Galatas, of whose excavation between 1992 and 2008 G. Rethemiotakis offers a valuable summary (ID2778; cf. ID1815). The palace, 0.6ha in area, was constructed in MMIIIA, undergoing a period of destruction and rebuilding by MMIIIB and gradually falling into disrepair before its final destruction in LMIA. The palace walls were built of orthostates and ashlar, and the overall structure had four wings, a central and a west court, with a Minoan hall in the north wing. A unique rectangular hall in the east wing had four pillars surrounding a rectangular hearth. Surrounding the palace were six structures constructed between MMIB and LMIIIA2-B, all sampled or completely excavated. The overall settlement reached its peak in LMIB, marked by high-quality Floral and Marine Style ceramics. t 114.

Galanaki (23rd EPCA) with a focus on the MMII structure (ID2830; cf. AR 53 [2006-2007] 107) (Fig. 116). The rectangular, single storey building (10.3 x 6.15 m) is close to the shore and lies over three Early Minoan tombs, while two more are nearby to the north and east. The exterior walls, made of local stone, are preserved to 0.5m in height; the main entrance is at the south end of the west wall. Finds other than ceramics were absent and the ceramics were dated mostly by fabrics: the majority (67%) is Protopalatial and some (6%) Neopalatial. Among the forms, cups are predominant, followed by closed vessels and cooking pots, and the occur rence of some outside the structure itself suggests activity there too. Three fabric groups were identified: a local fabric, used for cooking wares (non-calcareous, with added calcite, grog and vegetable matter); a second with phyllite/quartzite inclusions in two different proportions, also used for cooking pots and other vessels, perhaps originating at Malia or in the Pediada region; and a third, with ophiolite inclu sions, may originate in the Mesara. The important sanctuary site dedicated to the goddess Eileithyia at Inatos-Tsoutsouros on the south coast has been published (Kanta and Davaras [2011]). About 8km due north, more information has been presented by S. Mandalaki (23rd EPCA) on an important Neopalatial building (ca. 250m2), characterized as a 'typical Minoan rural villa', at the site of Kolokithi between the villages of Lagoutas and Skinias, overlooking the local plain (ID2850; cf AR 51 [2004-2005] 110-11). The main entrance at the south had a porch with two columns, while a secondary entrance at the southeast led to a staircase; the ground floor was mostly devoted to storage. Walls were constructed of local stone and mud-brick and were 0.95m thick externally, 0.5-0.6m internally. Fineware ceramics show parallels with LMIB material from Knossos and east Crete, with one possible Mycenaean (LHILA or B) import (Fig. 117). Room 1 was a later addition against the original west wall, entered from the west, with no direct communication to the rest of the complex. Finds here included a globular stirrup jar, a functional bronze double axe, three querns and 20 loomweights. Room 7, north of room 1, may have functioned as a lightwell, while storage areas were ranged along the east side, including an area used for stone vessels (room 8); four pithoi were also found. Destruction was by fire, perhaps in association with an earthquake, in LMIB, although no Marine Style ceramics were found. J g§: . % , y m h ■ 116. Gournes: aerial view of Middle Minoan structure and most of EMI cemetery from the southeast. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 23rd EPCA. On the Lasithi plateau, the site of Karphi continues to provide new data, in addition to the re-excavation in 2008 of the settlement site itself (ID777). A restudy of the ceramics from the Early Iron Age site has been published (Preston Day [2011]), while 12 new Minoan tombs have been excavated by V. Apostolakou (24th EPCA) at the known cemetery sites of Astividero and Vitsilovrysi (ID2782). Study by P. McGeorge of the human skeletal remains of 400 individuals from the extraordinary cave ossuary at Agios Charalambos has revealed information about the pre-MMIIB population transferred there: 16 cases of cranial trauma (11 in males) were identified, some from blades (Fig. 118), others from blunt instruments (ID2827). Three cases of trephination were also noted, one a child, two of which survived (Fig. 119); knife guide lines for trephination were noted on two other skulls, but the operation was not carried out. Excavations at the Minoan coastal site of Sisi reached their final season in 2011, as reported by J. Driessen (Belgian School/UC Louvain) (ID2824). Work continued on the Early Minoan to MMII tombs in the northern zone 1, especially the structure 9.1-2 initially explored in 2010. Excavations on the summit (zones 3-5) clarified the history of the Postpalatial complex CDE (Fig. 120). Probably constructed in LMIIIA2, its south wing was destroyed and abandoned early in LMIIIB, while the rest of the complex was destroyed later in LMIIIB, leaving substantial destruction deposits. Tests outside Building CD yielded a possible Linear B 117.

The southern part of zone 5 all predates the Postpalatial structures on the summit, predominantly belonging to the Protopalatial period, while the construction of Building CD cut through EMIII/MMIA architecture. Southeast of the summit (zone 6), Building F was shown to have been in use continuously from Protopalatial to Postpalatial times; its over 20m-long monumental façade was traced and found to combine with other walls to define an open court paved with blue pebbles. Six terracotta figurine fragments found in this area offer the first clear evidence of Post-Minoan use of the site. With exemplary speed, the Sisi team has also produced a second preliminary report, covering the 2009-2010 seasons, that is available as both a paper and on-line publication (Driessen [2011]). Excavation at Gournia in 2011, as reported by V. Watrous (SUNY Buffalo/ASCSA), focused on four areas: north of the excavated town; in the region of the 'palace'; north of House Ea in the town; and in Mycenaean House He (ID2860). North of the excavated town a Protopalatial street, lined with houses and a possible shrine was uncovered (Fig. 121). The history of the 'palace' was further refined by excavation of the palace wall in the north of room 13, which suggests a MMIIIA date for its construction, earlier than the LMIB date suggested by H. Boyd Hawes. Elsewhere in the 'palace', in room 18, Prepalatial and Protopalatial deposits were uncovered associated with a wall on a different orien tation to the later 'palace' walls. North of House Ea, the remains of four structures were traced through four major occupation phases: EMIII, MMIA into Protopalatial and two phases of MMII. Phase III comprised a large, single storeyed house in which weaving was carried out. The construction date of Mycenaean House He was shown to be LMIIIA1/2, while its second phase of use was LMIIIB. Finally, excavation beneath a section of Neopalatial street produced MMIIB material, suggesting that the street layout began in the Neopalatial (MMIIIA) period, after reorganization and rebuilding of the settlement. Three Minoan tombs were found at the sites of Porthias and Psathi near Kalamavka (ID2780). 121. Gournia: view of Protopalatial house and yard. OASCSA. J. Soles (North Carolina/ASCSA) and C. Davaras (Athens) report that study was completed for the publi cation of nine Neopalatial structures at Mochlos: Mochlos IV.III.' The House of the Metal Merchant and Other Houses in the Neopalatial Settlement. Of the nine houses to be published, only C.3, the 'House of the Metal Merchant' is mostly intact, the others are partially excavated, damaged by erosion or overlain by later material (ID2816). Between them the structures document the full Neopalatial stratigraphical sequence: MMIIIA, IIIB, LMIA (beneath Theran tephra in C.l) and several LMIB layers. In addition, excavation of a 31st tomb in the well-known LMIII cemetery is also noted. In the Siteia region, the important site of Petras has transformed our knowledge of both Prepalatial and Protopalatial archaeology in eastern Crete. A conference volume focused on the site has just appeared: Petras, Siteia - 25 Years of Excavations and Studies (Tsipopoulou [2012]), produced in collaboration with the Danish Institute in Athens. Prepalatial tholos tombs of Mesara type have been discovered in the Siteia region at Skopi Mesorachi (ID2802), west of Siteia, not too far from Chamaizi, poorly preserved, and at Livari Skiadi (ID1785), near the southeast coast, just east of Goudouras, with a nearby rock shelter used for burials within the same period and in Roman times (cf. ID763). South of Siteia, a LMIIIC tomb was excavated at Tourloti (ID2805). In the far east of the island at Palaikastro two new tombs were excavated by C. Sophianou (24th EPCA) at Vigla and Kastri (ID2794). One of the first publications to draw on the recent BSA excavations at the Roussolakkos site presents Block M of the Protopalatial and Neopalatial town (Knappett and Cunningham [2012]). Aegean scripts 2005-2010 The proceedings of the 13 th International Colloquium on Mycenaean Studies, held in Sèvres, Nanterre and Paris in September 2010, have just appeared (Carlier et al. [2012]) and the customary quinquennial update of new inscrip tions in the Aegean scripts by M. del Freo (2012) offers an opportunity to summarize the new material that continues to appear on Crete, even if slowly. In 2008 the excavations in Building n at Malia produced a pot fragment bearing three incised signs (MA/V Yb 04: 023 025-003) with Protopalatial material in Court 25 (cf. AR 55 [2008-2009] 84) and, in 2010, a three-sided ivory seal (MA/V S [1/3] 02: 044-049) in a MMIIB destruction deposit in room 17. A green jasper Petschaft, MMII by style and bearing four signs, discovered in House Tomb 4 of the Kephala cemetery at Petras, noted by M. del Freo, has just been published by O. Krzyszkowska (2012). A number of new Linear A inscriptions (three tablets [KH 97-99], one roundel [Wc 2123] and an incised vessel [KH Zb 1]) from Chania have been published by M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki and E. Hallager (2007) (see also del Freo [2012] 8-9, 16-17), although M. del Freo notes that the numbering has been adjusted to make it consistent with the overall Linear A corpus (for which a sixth, supple mentary volume is in preparation): KH 97, 99-100, KH Zb 98 and Wc 2123 (del Freo [2012] 8). KH 97 comes from the excavations in the Papadopoulou plot on Daskalogianni Street, in the Splantzia area (cf. AR 42 [1995-1996] 47), while the others were discovered in or close to the well-known excavations at Plateia Aikaterinis. Two further tablets and another roundel appeared in 2010</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 73 (KH 102, from the same context as KH 100) and 2007 (Wc 2124) and 2009 (KH 101), in excavations at Katre Street 1 (cf. AR 54 [2007-2008] 112. The roundel bears the Linear A and B 'cloth' logogram (AB 54; cf. del Freo et al. [2010] 351-53) on its face and has 15 seal impres sions around its edge, all from the same seal with two couchant lions. E. Hallager has published three new Linear A inscrip tions from Petras: a unique clay rod (PE Zg 6), with a two-line inscription separated by a ruling from a MMIII refuse pit, and two pithos inscriptions (PE Zg 7, 8) from the North Magazines destroyed in LMIB (Hallager [2012]). Linear A inscriptions, including the 'oil' logogram, on two fragmentary pots from LMI houses in Block C at Mochlos (cf. Kentro 10 [2007-2008] 3), will appear in the publication of Block C noted above. The inscribed objects (11 'libation tables' [SY Za 1-6, 8-12], plus one inscribed rhyton [SY Zb 7]) from the sanctuary at Kato Symi have been published as a corpus by P. Muhly and J.-P. Olivier (2008; cf. AR 56 [2009-2010] 188). Re-examination in 2009 of the flat-based nodule from Phaistos (PH Wb 53) by M. del Freo and J. Zurbach (del Freo [2012] 14) suggests it was not inscribed, while restudy by M. Perna of a spool-shaped seal (Garnrolle) in the Seager Collection of the Metropolitan Museum (Corpus der minoischen und mykenischen Siegel XII 96), probably of MMIII date, confirms that it is an extremely rare instance of a seal with Linear A incised on its two faces (del Freo [2012] 15). Finally, restudy by B. Davis on the basis of photo graphs suggests that the pithos inscription PK Zb 21 from Palaikastro should be reread as AB67-59-30-04, not AB13+10-59-30-04, as in the original publication (Davis [2008]). Linear B discoveries on Crete are less frequent. Chania has produced another inscribed stirrup jar (KH Z 43), an almost complete example, revealed in the course of work to roof over the Plateia Aikaterinis site in 2005 in the same complex in which three Linear B tablets were discovered in 1990 (Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Hallager [2007] 17-20). Its inscription (ze-ta-ro , wa), painted on the body of the vessel, may provide a further example of the use of wa as an abbreviation for wa-na-ka-te-ro/-ra 'royal' (cf. Shelmerdine and Bennet [1995] 130-31). Full publication of all the earlier painted pottery inscriptions will appear in the forthcoming fourth volume of the Greek-Swedish Excavations. A fragmentary Linear B tablet with a personal name (KH X 7) was discovered in the same LMIIIB context in Katre Street 1 as the Linear A inscriptions already mentioned. The first possible Linear B from the site of Prinias will be published shortly in the journal Pasiphae by M. Cultraro and A. Sacconi: two signs painted on a pot from the LMIIIB-C1 material from the cemetery (PïH Z 1). Bibliography Abbreviation AWiC = Andrianakis, M. and Tzachili, I.

The first, by E. Skafida (13th EPCA), J-P. Olivier and A. Karvava, was delivered at the Archaeological Society of Athens on 25 April 2012, and presented the first results of the multidisciplinary publi cation project of D. Theocharis' excavations at Kastro/Palaia Volou ('Two new Linear B tablets from the Late Bronze Age settlement at "Kastro-Palaia" in Volos: from the excavations of Dimitrios R. Theocharis to the results of the recent interdisciplinary investigations'); the second, by A. Batziou Efstathiou (15th EPCA) was delivered at the University of Athens on 14 June 2012 as part of the Mycenaean Seminar ('The Mycenaean settlement at Pefkakia in Volos - the Iolkos harbour?') and focused on the recent excavations at Pefkakia which revealed beneath the Hellenistic layers undisturbed layers datable to the Mycenaean period, namely parts of a building complex of LHIIB2-IIIB date with interesting portable finds. Both papers - also given in abbreviated form in the fourth AEThSE - will prompt serious discussion on the nature/hierarchies of Mycenaean presence/occupation around the gulf of Pagasai, modem Volos. On present evidence, settlements seem to adhere to a model not dissimilar to that which we know from the Argolid. New finds for next year's report Given the unusual wealth of news about archaeological activity in the region this year, the space constraints of this cursory report, and the imminent publication of the proceedings of the third AEThSE (at the end of 2012), which cover the years 2006-2008, we will postpone for next year the discussion of some important new finds on sites which will appear in that publication. A good example of these tantalizing finds is the area of Halos, near modem Almyros, where very rich evidence survives for the Early Iron Age necropoleis in the vicinity of Plátanos, Voulokalyva (Fig. 122) and Agrielia, which were used from the Sub-Mycenaean to the end of the Geometric period, and again in Hellenistic and Roman times (ID1044^16; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 487-89; www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 153-54). Two pottery kilns of the Geometric period and architectural remains belonging to apsidal buildings have been investigated Maria Stamatopoulou Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford Introduction As mentioned in last year's report, our knowledge of Thessaly has increased significantly in the last decade due, firstly, to major public works, such as the new national roads that traverse Thessaly north-south and east-west and which necessitated salvage archaeology on a very large scale during the 2000s, and, secondly, to the creation of the 34th EPCA in 2004, which has allowed a better organization, control and exploration of western Thessaly, a region that was considered (unjustly it seems) as a backwater. The local communities, departments of antiquities and the University of Volos are very proactive in communicating the results of this activity to the public, via the organization of many conferences whose proceedings are rapidly published. These regionally-focused publications, such as Hypereia for Velestino-Pherae, Achaiophthiotika and Othrys for the region of Almyros, Trikalina for western Thessaly, Thessaliko Hemerologio, and the much larger AEThSE, contain extremely useful infor mation that allows us to grasp the richness and complexity of the material culture of the region. Recent publications, conferences and public lectures For this year's report there is an unusually rich corpus of available information, as numerous publications that concern the region have appeared in press: ADelt 56-59 (2001-2004) [2011] Chr B2, containing preliminary reports of excavations conducted by the Archaeological Service between 2001-2004; the long article on the cemeteries of Demetrias and Pagasai by A. Batziou Efstathiou and P. Triantaphyllopoulou (2012); the volume of the then Ministry of Culture and Tourism on the excava tions of 2000-2010 (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes); and the proceedings of the fifth Hypereia conference {Hypereia). In addition, detailed reports on various excavations, most notably on the valley of Tempe (by the 15th EPCA and 7th EBA) were released for publication in the press (in the e journal Archaiologia: http://www.archaiologia.gr) following their presentation at conferences. In 2011 and 2012 several conferences that concern the region were organized: the fourth AEThSE on 15-18 March 2012, where the research/excavation activities of the years 2009-2011 were presented; the one-day conference entitled AZnAAIZ I, on ancient Melitaia in honour of F. Cantarelli on 5 August 2011 (http://www. archaiologia.gr/blog/2011/08/12/p.eLtxaía-7iapeX0óv 7tapóv-Kai-pékkov/); the one-day conference on the salvage excavations in the valley of Tempe (H Koûàôa xœv Tepiccbv: pía âiatpopexiKr/ npoaéyyior¡ péaa anó xa avaoKcupiKá svpr/paza Kai xiç papxvpieç xcov Kepitjyrjxcóv. npof¡Á.r¡paxwpoí yia zo pÉZkov xrjç) held at the Diachronic Museum of Larisa on 23 January 2012 (http://www. archaiologia.gr/blog/agenta/r| p.8píóa-yta-xr|V-K0ikáSa x(ov-Te|iJtcov/); a day conference on the marble quarries of the region {Ta ap/cáa dsaaaXiKá laxopeía Kai ta itpoïôvxa xovç), held on 18 May 2012, also at the Larisa Diachronic Museum (http://www.archaiologia.gr/blog/agenta/np-/aia Laxopeia/'), where I.

In addition, a long stretch of the impressive Early Hellenistic fortification enceinte has been revealed together with the southeast gate of the city walls (Fig. 123) (ID224, 1047) where there is evidence of habitation that post-dates the abandonment of the site following an earth quake in the mid-third century BC (ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 489-90, 524-29); various farmhouses have been identified in the Sourpi plain (for example at the locality Touvla: ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 475-76) that offer useful information for the exploitation of the chora of Halos and the settlement patterns in the region over time. Further north, at Phthiotic Thebes, modern Mikrothives, architectural remains of a building of rectan gular plan, whose finds suggest a use during the sixth century, were excavated below a stone cairn and groups of Hellenistic graves (Alexandrou in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 508-09, P. Koumarianou plot). Large sectors of the organized cemeteries of the ancient city have been investigated (ID1083), offering plentiful new evidence for the burial practices and trade links of the city (ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 475, 508-10; Alexandrou and Almatzi [2009]; www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes 153). Also of interest, given the great number of such installations recently investigated in Thessaly, is the bath complex of Imperial date (second century AD) that was revealed east of Aidiniotiki Magoula (Alexandrou and Almatzi [2009] 508-10, G. Dionysiou plot). Even more extensive and varied in nature is the evidence for the Late Roman/Early Christian city at Nea Anchialos, identified with Byzantine Phthiotic Thebes. In the last decade, rescue excavations have revealed, besides the well-known basilicas, significant sections of the urban plan, harbour installations, a public building that was possibly related to the harbour, luxurious private houses with mosaic floors, bath complexes and the extensive cemeteries of the city (ID1081-82, 1084-89, 2029; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 627-28, 631-39; Dina [2008] 415-23; www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 171). At Kallithea (ancient Peuma), the collaborative research project led by M. Haagsma and the 15th EPCA (S. Karapanou) continues, after the completion of the survey (ID458, 248, 2061; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 559-64), which has allowed recognition of much of the city plan and public buildings. Excavations have now begun of key monuments in the settlement. Two disserta tions have recently appeared about the domestic archi tecture and the defence systems of the region (Chykerda [2010]; Haagsma [2010]). Also in Phthiotis, at Pharsala, part of the Early Iron Age burial ground was identified at the edge of the western cemetery of the city and investigated in 2007-2008 by S. Katakouta (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 159). Evidence for habitation in this period was identified further afield from the Agia Paraskevi hill, on the plain (ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 542-43, 13 Kanari Street, O.T. 235, E. Tsinopoulos-Zygouri plot). The urban and salvage archaeology in the modern town of Pharsala is gradually revealing the layout and the successive phases of the city of Pharsalos, with more impressive Hellenistic phases (ID1076; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 543^14, 545^17, 551-56). We should note the remains of a possible public building at 12 Apollonos Steet, Kyriazi Tsoga plot (Katakouta in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 553), of a paved street of Hellenistic date at 54 123.

Kyritsi plot (Katakouta in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 546—47). In her communication at the fourth AEThSE, S.

Although the study of the Late Bronze Age finds in Thessaly is beyond the scope of this report, we should mention the important LHII-III remains that have been unearthed during public works at numerous sites around Lake Karla (ancient Boebe) and during the excavations that were necessitated by the widening of the national road E75, for example at Makrychori (Fig. 125) (remains of a settlement/houses and built tombs: Toufexis in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 540-42; www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes 158-59), at Amphithea (building remains of a Mycenaean period building: www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 157), at Koryphoula (part of Late Helladic buildings belonging to an organized settlement and small tholos tombs of LHIIIB date/use: ID1039; Adrymi-Sismani in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 499-502, 531) and at the locality Tsingenina in the periphery of the village of Kanalia (a tholos tomb used during the LHIIIA2-IIIB, that was erected at the site of a Middle Helladic building, and a pottery kiln of Mycenaean date: ID1990; Adrymi</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 77 Sismani inADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 502-05 [Fig. 126]). At Dimini, in addition to the monumental megara and settlement remains discovered by V. Adrymi-Sismani (ID1066, 1989, 1043), a building with two phases (LHIIIA2 and LHIIIB2-IIIC) was partially investigated at considerable distance from the core of the Mycenaean settlement, hinting at the extent of habitation (Alexandrou in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 473], At Pefkakia, on the northern promontory of later Demetrias, south of Volos, the aforementioned excavations by A. Batziou Efstathiou have revealed architectural remains and extremely plentiful pottery belonging to a building complex that must have been used for storage but also feasting purposes, that dates to the peak of the settlement in LHIIIA2-IIIB and fits a harbour site (press releases in Tachydromos 18.03.2012: http://www.taxydromos.gr/ article.php?id=42476&amp;cat=l; Thessalia 23.04.2012: http: //e-thessalia.gr/?p=19245; Ethnos 4.09.2012: http://www. ethnos.gr/article. asp?catid=22784&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=6363 4477). These finds have to be discussed alongside the discoveries from Dimini, the tholos tomb at Kazanaki (ID 1102) and the newly discovered evidence (Linear B tablets) from the diachronic settlement at Kastro Palaia/Iolkos (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 151), where small-scale excavations took place in the summer of 2012 to clarify issues of stratigraphy. Pelion peninsula The Pelion peninsula region received scholarly attention in the early 20th century with A.S. Arvanitopoulos' extensive reports and A. Wace's articles in the Journal of Hellenic Studies (Wace [1906]). Both identified and excavated antiq uities on numerous sites (for example at Theotokou on the Aegean coast) and attempted to sort out the historical topog raphy of the area, linking sites with names reported in ancient sources. With the exception of small-scale brief salvage operations (for example A. Liagouras' excavations of Classical tombs at Chorto in the 1960s and 1970s), the region has remained largely unexplored despite its obvious strategic and archaeological importance (Koulouras [1997] 11-28).

The Aegean shores, although on the whole harbourless, face one of the major sea routes connecting the southern Aegean with the north. According to Polybius and Livy, Philip V estab lished a signal station on this mountain in 207 BC to signal fleet movement to Demetrias (see, for example, Polybius 18.11; Livy 27.32, 27.33, 28.5-6, 28.8). With the exception of Demetrias, and most probably Iolkos (at modern Kastro/Palaia Volou?), no other site has been securely identified with an ancient settlement/polis, despite Scylax's and other authors' descriptions. One of the major sanctu aries of the region, the Oracle of Apollo at Korope, was in use from the Archaic to at least the Late Hellenistic period, and, although briefly investigated by Arvanitopoulos, it remains unpublished. The same is true for the Sanctuary of Zeus Akraios on the peak of Mount Pelion. The Pelion peninsula contained a number of settlements/poleis that were synoecized when Demetrias was founded in the early third century on the western mouth of the Pagasitic gulf. It is a scholarly desideratum to establish the status of these communities in the third century BC. Were they absorbed by the city of Demetrias? Did they continue for short periods after the city's foundation, as at Goritsa? Or, was it possible, especially for settlements far from the centre, to exist and function as (semi-) independent communities? In the last decade there has been renewed interest in the region, especially the southern Pelion peninsula, where rescue excavations and surveys have been conducted by K. Vouzaxakis. The first results of his work were presented at the recent AEThSE and a brief report released in the local press (Tachydromos 27.05.2012: http://www. taxydromos.gr/article.php?id=47593&amp;cat=l ; http://www. archaiologia.gr/blog/201 l/05/09/oTO-(pcoç-r|-apxaia okiÇmv-3/). His work has highlighted the difficulty of exploring this remote region, which lies far from the administrative centre of Volos (seat of the 13th EPCA) in a very beautiful but also steep, quite mountainous and often wooded terrain, broken by deep ravines and susceptible to very difficult weather conditions in the winter. Vouzaxakis' explorations have confirmed many of Wace's and Arvanitopoulos' observations, especially for major sites such as Chorto (possibly Spalauthra) and Paliokastro (possibly Olizon) on the narrow isthmus at the southern tip of the peninsula. Habitation in the region is attested already in the Bronze Age at the Agia Sophia peninsula on Trikkeri island (ancient Kikynethos?), as well as in the region of Argalasti, on a newly identified major site that is situated along the road leading from Argalasti to Xynovrysi, near the village Kallithea on the hill of Prophitis Elias. Based on surface finds, it seems that this site was inhabited throughout the Hellenistic period. Another new settlement site was recently identified in the area between Chorto and Argalasti and seems to have been inhabited in the Classical period. At Chorto, the ancient settlement remains on the hill of Pyrgos or Chomatokastro, situated south of the modern village by the sea, have been known since the early 20th century and are traditionally but tentatively identified with ancient Spalauthra (Wace [1906] 149-150; Arvanit opoulos [1910] 219-20; BCH 44 [1920] Chroniques 398; IACP s.v. Spalauthra, no. 358). The scattered evidence from the site suggests that it was inhabited from the Archaic through to the Roman period. From the site are known: votive and grave stelae of Hellenistic and Roman dates; a group of Classical and Hellenistic graves excavated on the eastern slopes of the hill by A. Liangouras in the 1960s-1970s, containing local and Athenian red-figure vases (ADelt 19 [1964] B2, 263); and a recently identified monumental tomb monument of Roman date. In 2008-2009 rescue excavations on the western slopes of the hill revealed parts of houses dating to the Hellenistic and Roman periods that seem to imply the existence of a large organized settlement, which occupied various terraces on the Pyrgos hill. The evidence for extensive Hellenistic habitation at Chorto, if confirmed by further excavation, would be very important in answering the question of the fate of the various Magnesian communities following the foundation of Demetrias in the early third century BC. It would seem that, contrary to settlements situated near Demetrias, such as Goritsa and Soros (ID1103-04, 227), which seem to have been abandoned soon after the foundation of the city, life may have continued in those settlements that lay further afield (one should consider Omolio in this respect). (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 155). The Roman presence in Thessaly needs further systematic investigation, especially after recent discov eries in the region. In the Pelion peninsula, apart from Chorto, finds of Roman date have been identified at Kottes (tombs) and northwest of the bay of Agia Kyriaki, at the locality Mylos where a Roman period fort (chôma tokastro), built to control sea traffic in the area, was located. Later finds are known from Theotokou and Lefokastro, where an Early Christian and later Byzantine settlement is being investigated by the 7th EBA (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 172). At the presumed site of ancient Olizon, on the hill of Paliokastro, Wace's observations regarding the large fortified ancient city were confirmed by Vouzaxakis' surveys. The area occupies a strategic location that commands the isthmus on the narrowest part of the southern Pelion peninsula and has use of two harbours, Valtoudi on the west (Pagasitic gulf side), by the locality Agios Andreas, and Chondri Ammos on the Aegean. Graves and scattered finds reveal the dense habitation of the site, which contained ample land for agricultural activity on the flat saddle between the two bays, as well as land for pasture on the adjacent hills. The proximity to the Tisaion mountain with its white marble quarries is surely not to be ignored. At the locality Diakopi, at the narrowest point between the Pagasitic gulf and the Aegean, a wall with rectangular towers at intervals of 120-50m blocks the pass to the Trikkeri peninsula. The 7th EBA's investiga tions suggest that it was a relatively modem constmction (Gialouri in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 646), but Vouzaxakis proposes that further investigation might be needed to confirm whether these are later additions/remodellings of ancient work on the site. Finally, at Theotokou, on the Aegean side, Wace investigated Iron Age tombs, a Doric temple of the fourth century BC and a Late Roman/Early Christian basilica in 1907 (Wace and Droop [1906-1907]; Liapis [2004]). In the late 1990s (Adrymi-Sismani in ADelt 51 [1996] B1 333) and in 2001 (Alexandrou in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 466) work conducted by the 13th EPCA on the northern slope of the Paliokastro hill revealed part of the acropolis wall and of a building of the Classical period, with plentiful pottery of the Classical and Hellenistic periods. More Iron Age tombs were investi gated near those discovered by Wace, as well as a cist</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 79 grave of the Hellenistic period that contained the inhumation burial of a child. Similarly to Chorto, habitation seems to have continued at the site after the foundation of Demetrias. Unfortunately, much of the settlement has been eroded by the sea. In conclusion, the recent and ongoing salvage archae ology and surveys conducted by K. Vouzaxakis have confirmed the very sound observations of early scholars interested in the region. Although at the early stages of his work, his decision to plot the finds on a new map that makes full use of current landscape archaeology resources will surely allow further understanding of this underesti mated region. Volos area On the Kastro/Palaia Volou hill, rescue and trial excava tions north of the Byzantine and post-Byzantine fortifi cation walls in the Kylindromylos Louli plot (Skafida et al. in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 510-15; www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 151) have demonstrated the diachronic and continuous use of the area from the Late Bronze Age to the ninth century AD. Despite the very large number of graves related to the settlement at Kastro/Palaia, which have been discovered north and west of the hill in the districts Nea Ionia, Agioi Anargyroi and Kapakli, not much is known about the settlement itself, as it has been investigated in small-scale trial trenches. Habitation is often inferred on the basis of pottery finds and partially preserved architectural remains of walls. Be that as it may, it is interesting to note the sporadic discovery of pottery of the late Classical and Hellenistic periods, which suggests that the site may not have been totally abandoned following Demetrias' foundation. Also of interest are the Imperial period finds in this plot, of the second to fourth century AD (Fig. 127), namely part of a wall, ca. 50m long and 1,7m wide, that probably belonged to the Roman aqueduct of the city. Its southern part was destroyed by the construction of a small bath complex (most likely private) which is preserved at foundation level (hypocausts); at least three building phases were observed and much earlier architectural material was retrieved, such as a poros block from a major Doric building (preserving a triglyph and metope), the base of a marble Ionic column of Imperial date (built into the bath complex) and part of a marble exedra bearing manumission inscriptions that can be dated on letter forms to the second century BC to the second century AD. We should note that more bath complexes have been revealed on the Kastro/Palaia hill, dating to late Imperial and Late Roman/Early Christian times (for example at Metropolitou Gregoriou Street: Dina [2008] 425). The recent study of the finds of an old excavation conducted by G. Chourmouziadis at Kastro/Palaia, at the corner of Souliou and Phrouriou Streets, revealed the architectural remains of a complex that can be identified as a workshop for the production of glass, datable to the second and third centuries AD (Fig. 128). The glass workshop has a paved floor, a well, a semicircular construction with ceramic tiles, coarse sherds of vessels, a deposit of waste and water pipes, as well as specialized structures with artefacts and perhaps raw materials appar ently relating to activities involving the chaîne opératoire for glass-object manufacture. The study of this excavation is conducted by T. Rehren (UCL), E. Asderaki (formerly 13th EPCA/UCL) and E. Skafida (13th EPCA). Parts of the Early Christian fortification walls and two of its towers were investigated at two sites in Kastro/Palaia (corner of Sarandaporou and Lachana Streets and Kresnas Street between Metropolitou Gregoriou and Phrouriou: Dina [2008] 425; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 640). At the other end of the modern city of Volos, during the excavation works for the new wing of the Athanasakeion Archaeological Museum, a Late Roman/Early Christian bath complex was revealed, suggesting another hub of activity and possibly a nucleus of habitation in the region (ID1098; www.yppo.gr/0 /anaskafes 171). Other buildings of the same date have been partially revealed in the district of Agios Konstantinos near the Archaeological Museum (Dina [2008] 426). Further afield at Kazanaki (near the Mycenaean tholos tomb investigated in 2004: ID1102) a farmhouse of Late Roman/Early Christian date, with six 127.

Thus, as E. Skafida and P. Triantaphyllopoulou stressed in their communication during the third AEThSE, the discovery of second- and third-century AD finds at Kastro/Palaia might suggest that the site was far more active in the Imperial period than was previously thought. Demetrias In last year's report we briefly discussed the evidence for the Roman phase of Demetrias. Many of the sites mentioned appear in some detail in the recently published Chronika of the Archaiologikon Deltion, alongside new finds, which were presented by P. Triantaphyllopoulou at the fourth AEThSE (Tachydromos 26.03.2012: http://www.taxydromos.gr/article. php?id=43146&amp;cat=l). For example, parts of the fortification enceinte of the city were revealed and investigated in the eastern part of the city by Cape Sesklo near Pefkakia and numerous graves of Hellenistic and Roman date belonging to the eastern cemetery of the city (Triantaphyllopoulou in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 463; Batziou-Efstathiou and Triantaphyllopoulou [2012]). The Roman period building complex that has been partially investigated in the northern sector of the city at Pelkakion Street, in the modem district of Aivaliotika, near the harbour, is among the most impressive of the city (Fig. 129) (Pallikara, Michalopoulou and Schefel properties: ID1048, 1061; Batziou-Efstathiou in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 516-19). Above the northern fortifi cation tower of the Hellenistic Demetrias is the courtyard of a Roman phase building; a threshold leads to a paved area and to a well, next to which is a mosaic pavement with decoration of two dolphins between a trident. To the west of the courtyard are the ancillary rooms: a semi-under ground room for storage and a staircase. Further west are rooms paved with mosaics decorated with geometric designs and even further west, accessed via three steps, a sector of the building complex that consists of various rooms: an ante-room, possibly semi-hypaethral with a well, and two more rooms which were found filled with pottery (Fig. 130). This part of the building has been identified as a shop (tavema) because of its architectural plan and the extraordinarily rich pottery assemblages retrieved from the various rooms. The finding of numerous hearths, of pottery used for the serving and preparation of food, and of more than 100 coins, mostly bronze, in good condition, seems to confirm this identification. The building was evidently destroyed by fire and is preserved in very good condition (with walls up to 1.6m high). According to the excavators, the rooms with the mosaic floors may have belonged to a merchant's house whose shop was within this complex, sharing an entrance with the house, via a stoa that was situated to the north of the complex, leading towards the seafront. The discovery of such a structure at a major port is hardly surprising. As the excavators stress, this complex offers a rare opportunity to study such a rich corpus of pottery (consisting of hundreds of pots) from a single context, with a range of shapes and dated to the third century AD. It also confirms the importance of Demetrias as a major port and commercial centre (no longer an administrative and political centre) during Imperial times.

To the west of the 'tavern' complex, rescue excava tions revealed a large part of an insula of the Roman city of Demetrias, that shows the dense occupation of the area during the second to the late third century AD (Tachydromos 26.03.2012: http://www.taxydromos.gr/ article.php?id=43146&amp;cat=l). The excavation was presented at the recent AEThSE by R Triantaphyllopoulou. Among the finds of the plot we should note the following: in the southwest part of the plot, three rooms belonging to a large building that has been identified as a workshop, perhaps for the manufacture of glass, in use during the mid-third century AD; an ancient street traversed by a stone-built drainage pipe that communicated with two smaller ones, belonging to the drainage system of the city, as well as clay water pipes; along the street, perhaps the remains of a stoa and of a partially investigated bath » % k ;-¥ V 131.

In the vicinity, we should note the discovery of a bath complex on a low hill northwest of Basilika A of Damokratia, Voulgaris property (ID1060). Another large Roman building complex was discovered at Aivaliotika, Lemesou Street, X. Tombras/B. Kalopitas' property (Triantaphyllopoulou in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 519-21). Although built of modest materials, its walls bore coloured plaster (red, light blue, green, black and yellow) and its northwest part was decorated with geometric and floral designs or in imitation of wall masonry. The floors were made of beaten earth and it was roofed with Lakonian type roof tiles. Ten rooms were revealed, judging by the decorated plastered walls. The western wing of the building is thought to have been used for entertaining (Fig. 132). In the rectangular semi hypaethral area situated in front of this wing, a small It 41 V* 132.

The northwest and southeast wings of the building must have been used for storage, food preparation and possibly workshop activities, as is suggested by the vast quantities of pottery (amphorae and cooking wares) and a large round construction that is covered with mortar. The extensive destruction layer with clear traces of fire shows that the building was abandoned in the mid-third century. Based on the finds, it is believed that the building was used already in the first century AD and was repaired on various occasions. Thus, as mentioned in last year's report, the modern neighbourhood of Aivailiotika, the area between the anaktoron and the coast, must have been the hub of the Roman city of Demetrias. A built pipe belonging to the Roman aqueduct of Demetrias was found here at Palatiou Street, Sp. Vranas' plot (Batziou-Efstathiou in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 476). At Lefkosias Street, O.T. T 31, A. Maniotis plot, three rooms of a house dated to the fourth century AD were revealed, arranged around a hypaethral courtyard. The northern room contained an intact destruction layer of Lakonian roof tiles, a grinder and parts of large vessels. It must have been used for the preparation of food. In the southern room, a hearth made of roof tiles was found. Alongside the rescue excavations that reveal the Roman and earlier phases of Demetrias, the systematic study and restoration of buildings and excavation complexes continues. We should note the recent publi cation of a sector of the cemeteries of Demetrias and of the Classical settlements that existed on this peninsula (Batziou-Efstathiou and Triantaphyllopoulou [2012]) and the creation of a very informative website on the ancient theatre of Demetrias by B. Intzesiloglou and his team that is now available for consultation: www.theatreofdeme trias.gr Ancient Pherae Ancient Pherae, modern Velestino, was one of the leading cities of Pelasgiotis. Investigations over the last 20 years have focused both on the city itself and on its chora, either through salvage operations or as part of systematic collab orative work (Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou and Arachoviti [2008]). For example, the project led by A. Doulgeri Intzesiloglou (13th EPCA) and M. Salvatore (Milan) aims to survey and analyse the evidence for the diachronic use and habitation of the chora of ancient Pherae (di Salvatore [1994]; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 537-38). In addition, various research projects have been inaugurated that explore facets of the material culture of the region in depth, for example the ongoing study of the corpus of Pheraean inscriptions and prosopography (by M. Salvatore and A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou: Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2010]), the study of Hellenistic Pheraean figurines (Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2010]; Asderaki-Tzoumerkioti and Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2010]) and the publication of stylistic and ceramic analyses of Pheraean lamps and relief bowls (Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [1990]; [1994]). Rescue excavations on at least 80 plots in Velestino were undertaken in the years 2000-2010 as part of the public works for the drainage system of the municipality of Pherae (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 155). These have significantly increased our knowledge about the layout and urban plan of the city, its public areas, sanctuaries, cemeteries and artisanal activities. Among the most important new finds was part of the fortification enceinte of the city, measuring 5.2m in length, discovered along the pedestrianized R. Pheraiou Street. The wall has been dated on masonry evidence to the fourth century BC, coinciding with the peak of Pheraean power. Among the most impressive monuments of the city was the peri-urban roadside Sanctuary of Enodia and Zeus Thaulios, situated northwest of the city, by the road to Larisa. There, in the 1920s, Y. Béquignon discovered two phases of a Doric temple (a fourth-century phase using material from a earlier phase) and deep dcposks/favissae containing very rich votives which revealed that the site was in use from the Geometric to the Hellenistic period. The excavation has been partially published (Béquignon [1937]). The material is dispersed between the archaeo logical museums of Athens and Volos, and investigations at the site had stopped. In 2006-2007, as part of a restoration project funded by the European Union and the Periphereia of Thessaly, under the direction of P. Arachoviti (13th EPCA), an oblong rectangular structure was discovered near and parallel to the long axis of the temple. It has been interpreted as an eschara or altar (based on the artefacts and other finds related to it) and can be dated to the Geometric period. It is noteworthy that it was not disturbed by the construction of the temple in the fourth century BC. North of the temple, a rectangular building of possible cultic use was revealed, consisting of three areas, in use during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In its vicinity, to the northeast, was a deposit containing clay figurines and protomes of Hellenistic date, depicting female figures that may be related to the venerated deity (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 154-55). The publication of the Proceedings of the fifth Hypereia conference in late 2010 contains some very interesting new articles on Pheraean archaeology. A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou (13th EPCA) presented the two research projects which are currently under way, on the epigraphy of the city and on the analysis of the terracotta figurines (Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2010]). Y. Pikoulas (Thessaly) discussed the evidence for the Pandocheion of Pherae, where in the summer of 346 the oaths, which confirmed the Peace Treaty that ended the Third Sacred War, were taken by Philip II and the Athenians and their allies (Pikoulas [2010]). Pikoulas refutes the suggestion by P. Chrysostomou (Archaiologika Analekta ex Athinon 16 [1983] 95-106) that the site must have been at Magoula Agrokepiou. He points out that this site is too close to the city walls of Pherae and too far from the main route which linked northern Greece with Thermopylae and the south. He proposes instead, in agreement with A. Doulgeri Intzesiloglou (Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2000] 346) and P. Arachoviti (Arachoviti [2002] 52) that the Pandocheion must have been very near the major north-south road that traversed the region, parts of which were discovered during public works at the location of the interchange at Velestino, and further north at the site of modern Ergostasio Armaton (Arachoviti [2002] 52; ADelt 52 [1997] B2 470; Koulouras [1997] 18, 241—42). Immediately east of the interchange at Velestino, a building complex was partially excavated by the 13th EPCA, measuring 960m2 and consisting of a large interior courtyard with many rooms around it. The numerous building phases and the variety and type of finds suggest that it was in use from the fourth to the second century BC.</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 83 Its architectural form, finds and location at the main cross roads of the ancient road system of Pherae, about 2.5km from the city, support this interpretation. If the identifi cation is correct, we are offered a fixed point in the topog raphy of the chora of Pherae. Major rescue excavations during the widening of the major north-south national road (E75) led to the afore mentioned discovery of the ancient road leading from Pherae to Pagasai, and alongside it the discovery of tomb monuments and farmhouses. Their investigation has added to our understanding of the use of the chora of the city (Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou in ADelt 53 [1998] B2 433-34; Arachoviti [2002] 52; Schiza [2002]). Also situated in the chora of Pherae, near its southern border, was the Sanctuary of Herakles at Spartia/Latomio. published in the Proceedings of the fifth Hypereia (Stamelou and Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2010]). The site is 9km west of Volos, near the railway station of Latomion, and was investigated in 1911 by A.S. Arvanitopoulos and in 1999 by E. Stamelou and A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou (13th EPCA) (AR 54 [2007-2008] 59; Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2000] 346). The sanctuary lay on the north slope of the hill of Spartia, near the 'Velestinostrata', the route that connected Pagasai to Pherae. Among the few architectural remains was the euthynteria of a structure of rectangular plan, measuring 3m wide and more than 4m in length, that has been identified as an altar, based on the discovery of fire remains and charred fragments of animal bones and pottery sherds. Around it a thick layer of stones covered votive deposits that contained numerous artefacts dating to the Archaic period. Votives included bronze and iron weapons, figurines, tools, jewellery, clay figurines, animal vessels and clay vases, as well as Hellenistic lamps and pottery and a coin of the city of Histiaia. Notable among the finds is an inscribed bronze omphalos phiale discovered in 1999 that bears the inscribed dedication of Telephilos to Herakles (Fig. 133), and the head of a kore and the leg of a marble statue that were discovered on the site earlier in the century. The date of the votives reveals a peak of visitation and dedication in the late seventh and sixth centuries. The stratigraphie analysis of the finds suggests that the altar was built over an earlier layer of use. This sanctuary confirms the importance of the cult of Herakles at Pherae, attested in the city itself by the shrine on the Agios Charalambos hill and by many inscriptions and myths referring to the city. It also offers another example of an Archaic period shrine of the region, that requires further attention and exploration. Finally, B. Intzesiloglou (formerly 13th EPCA) (Intzesiloglou [2010]), in the same volume, discusses the evidence regarding the ancient settlement that is situated on the summit of the hill of Merias, north of the modem village of Glaphyres (formerly known as Kapouma). The site remains virtually unexplored; the fortified part around the Prophitis Elias hill is undisturbed, as was shown by comparison of recent photographs of its fortifications to those published by Wace in the early 20th century. This settlement is usually identified with ancient Glaphyrai, a community later incorporated into Demetrias. The recent discoveries in the chora of Pherae show that this mountainous site was not isolated, but well connected with the road systems of the area, both with the Gulf of Pagasai and Iolkos and with Pherae and Lake Boebe (Karla) to the west and north. Larisa Larisa was (and still is) the most important city in Thessaly (in antiquity the leading city of Pelasgiotis). Excavations have revealed some key monuments of the city (Tziafalias [1994]), especially of late Imperial and Late Roman/Early Christian date, that showcase the prosperity of the city during that time (Dina [2008] 414; Gialouri [2008]; www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 169). For example, at the corner of Nikis and Dimitras Streets, Mouliou plot, successive architectural remains were revealed, belonging to a neighbourhood in the eastern part of Larisa that shows the transition from the late Roman Larisa to the Byzantine fort (ID1975). We should note the discovery of part of a major road of the Roman period with a stoa along its western side. The area was later used for housing (Early Christian period), while the proteichisma of the Justinianic fortifications of the city was also identified at the site. A. Gialouri proposes that this road might be the decumanus maximus (Fig. 134). 133.

Panagouli Streets), and elaborate building complexes of the third to fourth century AD with mosaic floors, such as that discovered at the corner of Koumoundourou and A. Gazi Streets, where part of a bath complex was found (underneath which was a gravel-street layer of the second to first century BC: S. Sdrolia in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 602). At 69-71 Al. Panagouli Street the corner of a building constructed in the opus mixtum technique was revealed with elaborate mosaic pavements, belonging to a luxurious dwelling of Late Roman/Early Christian date (Gialouri in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 605). Significant sections of the Early Christian fortification walls of the city and bath complexes of Late Roman date were discovered in 2003-2004, at 3m below the modem road surface of El. Venizelou Street, at Plateia Laou (S. Sdrolia in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 600-02). The fortification walls of the city were revealed in two sections, measuring 9m and 23m in length. Under the walls were the remains of an earlier habitation complex and a gravel paved street, with southwest-northeast orien tation, that had been destroyed at the end of the fourth century AD. A small bath complex (hypocausts surviving) that was destroyed in the fourth century and later covered by the proteichisma of the Justinianic fortifications was also revealed (Fig. 135). At 6 Manolaki Street, parts of a large cistern were discovered in 2003 (two parts had been revealed in the 1970s by N. Nikonanos) (Fig. 136). The cistern was rectangular in plan, with estimated exterior dimensions of ca. 20 x 33m. It consists of three rectangular areas, built in the opus mixtum technique, one on the east-west axis nims. . j " '""VT jur-&lt; 5 I p ife lii-s;-;: .:,j': V;: SmmW^i » 135.

All areas communicated through four arched openings. The maximum height of each area is estimated at 6m, and therefore the capacity is estimated at 2,350 cubic metres of water. Along the eastern face of area C, the façade of the cistern was shaped into a luxurious fountain building that was 3m wide and at least 18.5m long. The floor of the fountain had originally been paved with marble plaques, which were removed with care when the cistern ceased to be used. The face of the eastern wall of the cistern was also covered with marble slabs. In the fill, numerous fragments of white marble (Atrax) and green (Chasambali) were identified. A. Gialouri compares the nymphaeum to that of Nikopolis (Gialouri [2006]). The</page><page sequence="85">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 85 location of the cistern in the northwestern part of the city suggests that water was probably brought from the springs on the hills to the north or northwest of the city. Based on its size and construction it has been proposed that it was the main cistern of Larisa. Its date is derived from strati graphic evidence and by the numerous bronze coins of the fourth century AD that were collected from the fill of room C. According to A. Gialouri it should be linked to the rise of Larisa as a principal city of Thessaly under Diocletian's reforms that brought the end of the Koinon, at the end of the third century AD. The evidence from the fill of the building suggests that it was used in the fourth and fifth centuries AD (Gialouri 2006). Melitaia A day-conference in honour of F. Cantarelli took place on 5 August 2011 in Melitaia, entitled AZUAAIZ I: Hpepíóa yia zt]v lazopia Kai zr¡v ap/aioXoyía zr/ç Mefoxaiaç Kai zr\ç evpûzeprjç nepio/tiç zrjç (the programme and the power point presentations of the conference are available online at: http://www.melitaia.gr/main/index.php?option=com _content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99:2011-09-18-06-11 39&amp;catid=41:2010-12-21-10-45-25&amp;Itemid=76&amp; lang=el). The history of archaeological research in Phthiotis and the challenges facing archaeologists today were presented in a poster by M-Ph. Papakonstantinou and L. Stavroyiannis (14th EPCA); the Neolithic culture/settle ments at Domokos by S. Dimaki (14th EPCA) and the Neolithic settlement at the locality Pournarakia Philiadonas by S. Baikousis (14th EPCA). An early fifth-century burial group from the environs of Domokos, ancient Thaumakoi, was noteworthy for the discovery of a sword and four Attic vases of the first quarter of the fifth century in a single grave (M. Sipsie, 14th EPCA). L. Stavrogiannis (14th EPCA) presented the evidence for the chora of the city and the expansion of Melitaia in the Hellenistic period. He noted the discovery of numerous sanctuaries, for example the large sanctuary situated on the southern border of the city, on the mountain, dedicated to Zeus. F. Cantarelli summarized the results of her research on the fortifications of Melitaia (Cantarelli [2008]). She has shown that the earliest fortifications surrounded only the acropolis, on the south slope of the hill. Only a small part is preserved, about 60m long, built of small irregular stones which were worked only on the outer face, which she has tentatively dated to the second half of the seventh or the sixth century. The Classical period fortifications covered a far larger area, measuring 3.5km long, and were built in the emplekton technique (3.05m wide). The impressive height of the fortifications of Melitaia was noted in ancient sources, on the occasion of the siege of the city by Philip V in 217 BC. A third-century BC inscription found incorporated in a tower of the walls mentions the funding of their construction, with a sum of 10 talents, by Amynandros king of the Athamanians, a few decades after the attempted siege by Philip V. K. Psarogianni (14th EPCA) and P. Tileli (14th EPCA) focused on the defensive system of western Achaia Phthiotis. A series of fortified settlements and cities reveals the strategic importance of the region, located along one of the major routes that connects the south to the north. The recent discoveries of significant stretches of forti fications at Kallithea, in the Othrys mountains and in the cities of western Thessaly require a detailed analysis of the defence systems of Classical and Hellenistic Thessaly. Valley of Tempe Since 2008 excavations have been conducted in the Valley of Tempe, necessitated by the public works for the creation of a tunnel that forms part of the new stretch of the E75 road that bypasses the narrow valley. Very interesting finds have been discovered, revealing the diachronic importance of this strategic region. They were presented in January 2012 at a day-conference held in the Diachronic Museum of Larisa, organized by the Somateio Dryas in collaboration with the 15th EPCA and 7th EBA {Archaiologia 23.01.2012: http://www.archaiologia.gr/ blog/agenta/ripBpíSa-yia-xriv-KoiXáSa-TCov-xepncóv/; Eleutheria 01.02.2012: http://www.eleftheria.gr/ index.asp?cat=7&amp;aid=36310) and in March 2012 at the fourth AEThSE. Preliminary reports have appeared in the e-journal Archaiologia (Batziou-Efstathiou [2012]; Sdrolia [2012]; Toufexis et al. [2012]). At the eastern entrance of the Valley of Tempe, at Phylla Giolia, near the Peneios river, an area occupying 500m2 was investigated in 2010-2011, revealing part of an Archaic cemetery with mostly cremation burials (and a few inhumations), as well as a few inhumation burials of the fifth and fourth centuries BC (Toufexis et al. [2012]). The graves are located in the plain, in an open area which is situated about 1km northwest of the neighbouring ancient city, by the modem village of Omolio (on the Prophitis Elias hill), that is traditionally identified with ancient Omolion. Density characterized the excavated area. As mentioned by the excavators, in a trench measuring 5 x 6m there were 54 cremations, and they follow a consistent east-west orientation (Fig. 137). These are secondary cremations, with the ashes collected in a vessel that was placed upright in a small pit. The rim of the vessels was closed by a flat slab; about 0.1m above it an oblong, rather large rectangular schist slab was usually found, placed horizontally. Behind it, on the eastern side of the pit, lay an upright roughly-hewn flat slab that served as a marker of the grave. The urns are mostly stamnoid vessels with horizontal handles on the shoulder of the vessel. They are decorated with petal or drop-shaped motifs, bands and wavy lines, and occasionally have bore holes in their bases for libations. They are most likely of local manufacture and 137.

Some vessels stood out for their unusual decoration, for example a tripod urn, made specif ically for burial/ritual use, that is decorated with relief snakes on the shoulder and handles (Fig. 138), and rows of impressed circles and incised floral decoration on its body. Most of the urns were accompanied by other objects, predominantly small clay vessels (jugs, kotyles, skyphoi) but also iron weapons (knives and spearheads) and bronze jewellery. Bronze rings in significant numbers were often found outside graves among the semata. Inhumation burials are far fewer, and were mostly in pits with very few grave goods. As very few Archaic cemeteries have been systemati cally investigated in Thessaly, the discovery of an organized cemetery at Omolio is very important as it allows comparisons with other known cemeteries - for example the burial tumuli at Agios Georgios near Krannon, where cremation in urns also predominated and metal finds were common, or Halos, where secondary cremations and semata of similar type have been observed. It might also allow a better understanding of mortuary archaeology, funerary practices and eschato 0 5cm 138.

A few graves of sixth-century date are also known from Pelinna (Vaboudi et al. [2009] 460), Gephyria (ancient Thetonion?), the area of later Demetrias (Batziou-Efstathiou and Triantaphyllopoulou [2012]) and Soros. At a distance of 30m southeast of the Archaic cemetery, eight inhumation graves of the Classical period were found; they are dated on pottery finds to the late fifth and mostly fourth centuries BC. In the single cist grave, numerous and often elaborate objects were given as grave goods: red-figure and black-glaze vessels, such as two Attic red-figure pelikes with a horse protome and a female head on one side and himation-clad men on the reverse (Fig. 139); clay figurines of seated women; a figurine of a horseman; an imitation chair; an imitation bathtub; and rich jewellery that bears very close resemblance to that investigated by D. Theocharis in the 1960s and later published by S. Miller (Miller [1979a]). The gold jewellery found in the grave bears close resemblance also to assemblages from neighbouring Macedonia and reminds us of the influence exercised by Macedonia in the northern Thessalian regions of Perrhaibia and northern Magnesia from the mid-fourth century onwards. At the western entrance to the Valley of Tempe at the locality Chani tis Kokonas, numerous architectural remains were found, belonging to various structures that show use of the area from the fourth century BC to the Middle Byzantine period (Fig. 140).</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 87 n.E.O.

In sectors A and B, in an area occupying 25 x 30 m, ten rooms belonging to a building complex that has been identified as a shrine for Cybele have been excavated (Fig. 141). The south wall of the complex follows the stepped terrain and served as a retaining wall of the structure. The walls consist of stone foundations, built of undressed stone, and must have had a mud-brick super structure. The floors were made of beaten earth with the exception of room 5, which had a floor measuring 1.7 x 1.9m made of four large, worked-limestone slabs. Roof tiles of the Lakonian type have been preserved from its roof; notable among them are two pan tiles which each bear a round stamp, one reading ©EO®ANHX:AEOKY and the other APIZTOcDANOYX. As the excavators stress, direct parallels are known from the neighbouring city of Gonnoi. A square structure identified as an eschara was found in the centre of rooms 3 and 6, measuring 1 x lm and built of four limestone slabs.

Inside the southern niche, the left part of a small marble naiskos stele was found, depicting a seated Cybele with a lion on her knees; in the northern niche was a clay incense burner with pyre remains in its interior. In another area of this complex, a clay plaque measuring 30cm in height, with a relief representation of a protome of Artemis holding a small deer and bearing a hole for suspension in the back side, indicates that Artemis was a visiting god at the sanctuary. The pottery collected was plentiful: plain pottery predominates (cooking and storage wares), but black glaze vessels (plates, kantharoi, bowls and some West Slope), a few red-figure fragments and lamps of the fourth and third centuries BC were also found. Terracotta figurines, metal finds, bone and glass objects, and clay loomweights are among the finds from the site, as well as two plain stone stelae and two bases for stelae. The bronze coins found in the complex originate from Larisa, Phalanna, Gyrtone and Phlious, but there are also Macedonian royal issues. To the southeast of the complex, pit graves of the fourth century were investigated. Second-century BC graves were built on the side of the complex, after it had been abandoned. Sporadic burials continued in the Roman (third century AD) and Early Christian periods. As the excavators stress, Cybele and Artemis, deities related to mountains and wild animals, hunting and nature, are appropriate divinities for an environment such as that of the Valley of Tempe. The plan of the shrine of Cybele at the entrance of the Tempe Pass recalls domestic architecture, similarly to those of other shrines of the Mother of the Gods found in areas under Macedonian control, for example Pella, Aigai/Vergina and Demetrias (Toufexis et al. [2012]). Its discovery near the border with Macedonia is very important and could lead to a better understanding of the role of the Mother of the Gods/Cybele in the local pantheon, as well as of the inter action between Macedonian and Thessalian religious beliefs. The shrine was in use from the fourth to the second century BC, when it was abandoned, possibly as a result of the turbulent conditions caused by the Macedonian wars. Immediately to the east of Chani tis Kokkonas, at the foot of Mount Ossa, at Tsiriga Chorafia, a quarry of grey marble which was used in antiquity has been recorded (ID1357). A Late Roman/Early Christian settlement was investigated on the slope of the hill near the national road, with evidence of workshop installations (a kiln, a wine press, a lime kiln). It has been dated on pottery evidence to the fourth century AD, as were a few tombs found further up the slope. According to their excavator, S. Sdrolia (7th EBA), both sites must be linked to the nearby quarry (Sdrolia [2012]). Further down towards the plain, adjacent to the national road, the remains of a Middle Byzantine inn were excavated. The excavator believes that it was erected on the site of a Roman stop, alongside the road leading from Tempe to Thessaly (other stops have been located at Evangelismos and possibly Palioklesi further east). Fifteen metres to the east of the inn, a Byzantine temple was investigated on the site of a shrine of Cybele, suggesting a diachronic use of the area for cult activities (ID1981, ID2328; Sdrolia [2012]). Western Thessaly The preliminary results of recent work in western Thessaly (ancient tetrads of Hestiaiotis and Thessaliotis) have appeared in numerous publications, for example Hatziangelakis (2007) and Trikalina 29 (2009), the proceedings of AEThSE 2, as well as the recent ADelt. One of the most important results of recent activity in the region has been the identification of ancient sites with cities/settlements known from literary sources, mainly thanks to epigraphic evidence often surviving on stamped roof tiles. Thus, in Thessaliotis (roughly the area of the modern prefecture of Karditsa), modern Ermitsi can be identified with ancient Peirasies (Hatziangelakis [2007] 41—42; [2008] 319; www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 162) (Fig. 142), Myrine with ancient Methylion (Hatziangelakis [2007] 39; [2008] 320), Pyrgos Kieriou with ancient Kierion (ID1111; Hatziangelakis [2007] 44-46) and the settlement at the locality Chelonokastro near the village of Kedros with ancient Orthe (Intzesiloglou [2000a]). In Hestiaiotis, topographical studies by L. Hatziangelakis (2008) and Y. Pikoulas (2009) have allowed for reasonable hypotheses about the identification of settlements, from example Kalabaka with ancient Aiginion (first proposed by Leake; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 592-93), the fortified settlement by Skoumbos Peristeras with ancient Phaloreia (Pikoulas [2009]) and Vlochos Karditsas with ancient Limnaion. In addition, archaeological investigation has revealed significant new evidence for all periods of antiquity. Leaving aside the Neolithic and Middle Helladic periods, Mycenaean period finds have been identified at numerous sites, most recently at the magoula (mound) east of the village of Astritsa (ID1106; www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 162), at Mavromati, locality Vlachothanasis, where rich pottery deposits and animal figurines were unearthed (ID1108; Hatziangelakis in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 572-74; www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 162-63), by Magoula Papoutsi at Palamas on Thermopylon Street 142.

Together with the monumental tombs at Georgikon (AR 52 [2005-2006] 75-76) and Dranista, they should lead to a new study and evaluation of Mycenaean presence in western Thessaly. 143. Magoula Papoutsi, Palamas: view of the impressive wall. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 34th EPCA. Thessaliotis The remains of the ancient city located at the village of Pyrgos Kieriou have been securely identified with ancient Kierion, a leading city of Thessaliotis (Hatziangelakis [2008] 316-19; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 578). Situated in the centre of the western Thessalian plain, it controlled fertile land and major land routes, while it had easy access to a water source in the nearby Sophaditikos river (ancient Kouarios/Kouralios). The city, which issued silver coinage already in the early fifth century BC and again in the late fifth/early fourth century BC, remains largely unexplored. On the summit of the Oglas hill, which served as the acropolis, parts of the fortification walls and two towers were investigated (Fig. 144) (ID1111). It has been shown that the width of the wall was 2m on the acropolis and 3.05m on the curtain that traversed the plain; the latter was preceded by a trench (ID1355). Within the fortified area, pottery finds and architec tural remains confirm habitation from at least the Archaic period. The forearm of a life-size terracotta statue and female protomes, as well as epigraphic evidence, give clues as to the religious activities and cults of its inhabi tants. In the chora of Kierion several shrines have been identified, for example the Late Classical and Hellenistic shrine of Asklepios excavated at the locality Paliokastra, by the village of Agioi Theodoroi, on the road to Methylion (modern Myrine), where statuettes of children and finds showing usage from the fourth to the second century BC have been identified (Intzesiloglou in ADelt 40 [1985] B 196; ADelt 43 [1988] B1 253-54). Evidence for pre-Classical habitation is limited and is mostly funerary, namely the Protogeometric tholos tombs by Agioi Theodoroi and Chomatokastro Matarangas (ID1110; Hatziangelakis in ADelt 56 -59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 577-78) in the chora of Kierion. The cemeteries of the Archaic to Roman period of Kierion have been investi gated at the localities (ID 1069) of Kalampokies Matarangas, Xeraulaka (a tumulus covering very disturbed cist graves: ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 471) and Kotronolakkes on the border of the village of Moscholouri {ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 470-71, 479, 494). The latter site has been extensively excavated. Numerous tumuli of Early Iron Age, Classical and Hellenistic dates have been identified in the periphery of the village of Pyrgos Kieriou. Further south at Kedros, ancient Orthe, investiga tions in the 1990s and 2000s revealed parts of a house of the fourth century BC, which the excavator proposes belonged to a potter (Intzesiloglou [2000a] 169), a peri urban sanctuary at Chaliadia (possibly related to Demeter) and the line of the fortification walls. The cemeteries of the city have been partially explored, with graves dating from the fourth century BC to the Roman period (Hatziangelakis [2007] 53; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 579 for the southeast cemetery of the city). At the pass which connects the western to the eastern plain, a strategic location, by the locality Kastro near the village of Sykeon lies an unidentified ancient city, the remains of which were investigated in the 2000s. At Kastro, the partially revealed foundations of a building of rectangular plan were revealed to a length of 16.8m. This has been dated on pottery evidence to the Classical period and was erected above prehistoric remains (ID1040; Hatziangelakis [2008] 324-26). The plan of the building and the row of interior supports in the form of pillars recalls other monumental buildings, for example the Temple of Apollo at Moschato and the Temple of Apollo at Soros. In addition to the well-known Early Hellenistic tumulus by the road to Krannon, east of the village, an 144.

Sykeon: view of the bath complex with mosaic floors. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 34th EPCA. elaborate bath complex was partially investigated to the north of the ancient settlement; mosaic pavements decorated with geometric designs were revealed in two large rooms, dated to the second century AD (Fig. 145) (Hatziangelakis [2007] 25, 31; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 576). Hestiaiotis Further north, in the region of ancient Hestiaiotis, 3km north of the village of Petroporo (former Palaiogardiki), are the remains of the large fortified city that is commonly identified with ancient Pelinna. The city figures in the Tenth Pythian Ode by Pindar, which celebrates the close links of its aristocratic families with the Aleuads of Larisa. In the Hellenistic period it followed a consistent pro Macedonian policy. The site has been largely unexplored, with the exception of its cemeteries. In the late 2000s, a long stretch of the impressive fortification walls along with a city gate in the western part of the enceinte and a postern in the same area were cleared and studied (ID811, 1114). Constructed of local limestone in the isodomic style, and measuring 2.7-2.8m in width, they have been dated to the late fourth century BC (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 168; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 589-90) (Fig. 146). A public building, measuring 30 * 30m, has been located on the western side of the city, where a relief related to Asklepios and finds with Dionysiac overtones were unearthed (Hatziangelakis [2008] 306-07). The cemeteries of the city, in use from the Late Archaic period onwards (Karapanou and Katakouta [2004]; Vaboudi et al. [2009]; ADelt 52 [1997] B2 512-22), were very extensive and contained tumuli (including that in which the famous gold strips with Orphic-Bacchic texts were found in the 1980s), a Macedonian type tomb and many cists, pit and tile covered graves. It is hoped that investigations at the site will confirm the identity of the city. Further west, at Trikala, the site of ancient Trikke, a leading city of Hestiaiotis, very little was known about the layout and the archaeology of the city, except for the Roman and Early Christian architectural remains south of the Kastro (Varousi) that had been tentatively linked to the famous Asklepieion. These are a Late Hellenistic stoa type building, part of a two-phase construction preserving -jf&amp;Wi 146. Petroporos, ancient Pelinna: view of the fortification walls. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 34th EPCA. elaborate figurai mosaics of the third century AD, and a contemporary bath that has been identified as part of a large gymnasium complex (Tziafalias [1988]; Hatziangelakis [2008] 310-12). Rescue excavations since 2007 have started to shed light on the habitation history of the city as architectural remains have been unearthed across the city (ID1113; Hatziangelakis and Tselios [2009]; Hatziangelakis in ADelt 56-59 [2001—2004] Chr B2 585-89; www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 167—68). At I. Dragoumi and Mataragiotou Streets on the A. Daskalopoulos property, on the eastern side of the town of Trikala, ancient architectural remains were apparently destroyed by locals; their construction, size and workmanship suggest that they may have belonged to a monumental structure, possibly the fortification walls at the eastern edge of the city (Hatziangelakis and Tselios [2009] 473-74; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 585-86). West of I. Dragoumi Street, along Krystalli and Mataragiotou Streets (B. and O. Kalliagra property), parts of a public building have been partially unearthed; among the movable finds from the site, the high-quality pottery of Hellenistic and Roman date and the votive relief pinakes of Hellenistic date depicting Hermes (Fig. 147) imply that the building was a shrine located at the eastern edge of ancient Trikke (Hatziangelakis and Tselios [2009] 473-75; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 586-87). At 27 Pagalou Street on the Siafarika plot (ID1113; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 587-88), small sections of Hellenistic houses were partially investigated, showing clear signs of repairs and remodelling. Higher up, a Late Roman building with mosaic floors was found. The mosaic floor occupies an area measuring 6.7 x 14.7m, and is decorated with geometric designs surrounding medallions with birds, animals, flowers and vessels (Fig. 148). The large quantities of pottery, loomweights, spindle whorls, tools (including strainers) and a mould for the production of relief bowls and figurines suggest workshop activities. Moreover, lamps, figurines, stone tools, fragments of glass, bone spools and 16 coins (among</page><page sequence="91">which are two silver denarii of Vespasian) show that the building could be dated to the first century AD (Hatziangelakis and Tselios [2009] 476-77). Furthermore, at the corner of A. Diakos and Pagalou Streets (G. Kyrkos plot) on the plain, walls belonging to a building complex of the Hellenistic period, a clay water pipe, wells and movable finds suggest that the area might have been used for the production of pottery. The discovery of a clay tile stamped with the name of the potter Sosas would confirm such an identification (Hatziangelakis and Tselios [2009] 478). Important workshop installations were also revealed in 2001 at Metropolis, also in Hestiaiotis. Here, numerous pottery kilns were found both in the centre of the modem town (Fig. 149) (in the central square, of Hellenistic and Roman date) and in the periphery of the town in the cemetery areas (ID1074, 1072; Rondiri in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 494—95). Similarly to other western Thessalian cities, elaborate figurai mosaic floors were found in relation to Roman bath complexes (Intzesiloglou [2000b] 374-75; Hatziangelakis [2007] 58-59). Although known since A.S. Arvanitopoulos' excavations of the elaborately furnished late Hellenistic graves in 1909 (Arvanitopoulos [1912]; Miller [1979b]), the area was not systematically explored. In rescue investigations, the line of the fortification walls has been traced (Hatziangelakis [2008] 313-15 on the walls of the city) and architectural remains in the city indicate its affluence in Hellenistic and Roman times. The discovery of buildings with Roman period mosaics offers a similar picture to that of Trikke and invites close study and comparison (see the remains of a road and a house with five rooms and mosaic floors: ADelt 40 [1985] Chr 195). The chora of the city is not fully explored, but two monumental finds - the Mycenaean tholos tomb at Georgikon with evidence of ancestor/hero cult in the Late Archaic period and the Late Archaic temple at Moschato - are very important in under standing the significance of the region for the formation of Thessalian identity in the Late Archaic period. 147.

Metropolis: plan of the pottery kilns found in the central square. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 15th EPCA. Finally, the more recent rescue excavations necessitated by the widening of the national road E65 have yielded spectacular results. An Early Archaic sanctuary (and settlement) was investigated at the locality Dovres or Raches by the village of Agia Triada (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 165). A votive deposit with rich Classical period pottery was found by the locality Touloumbes by Loggos (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 164-65). A rural sanctuary was investigated 2km from the village of Anavra and presented by Ch. Karagiannopoulos and L. Hatziangelakis (34th EPCA) during the fourth AEThSE (also www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes 165) (Fig. 150). It appears that a períbolos wall enclosed the shrine; among the architectural remains we should mention the discovery of a single-room building (square in plan) in antis, of small dimensions, that contained numerous objects of ritual character (a large female protome, vessels found upside down). The shrine produced more architectural remains and many pits were investigated that had been used for sacri fices/ritual acts and deposition of offerings. The character and type of the plentiful finds (protomes, figurines, metal objects, especially jewellery, rings, etc.) lead to a tentative interpretation of the venerated deity being Artemis. The site was in use from the Archaic through to the Hellenistic period, and is situated in southwest Thessaliotis, reflecting the impact of major public works in uniting the different parts of the modem region.</page><page sequence="92">92 MARIA STAMATOPOULOU 150. Anavra: detail from the sanctuary. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 34th EPCA. The northern Sporades In 2009 a systematic survey project was inaugurated at Kephala on Skiathos (Fig. 151) by the University of Thessaly (under the directorship of A. Mazarakis Ainian) and the 13th EPCA (under the directorship of A. Doulgeri Intzesiloglou) (http://extras.ha.uth.gr/skiathos/gr/season 2011.asp). The settlement, which occupies a narrow, steep peninsula 140m long (north-south) and 37-50m (narrowest at the north) wide, is situated on the northern shore of the island and is most likely identified with ancient Palaiskiathos, the earlier of the two poleis mentioned by Skylax (Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou [2000] 350; [2001]). The slopes of the hill of the peninsula are very steep and have been badly eroded, with the exception of the saddle that connects the plateau at the centre of the peninsula with the shore to the south. Very few architec tural remains are visible on the acropolis on the summit of the plateau due to dense vegetation. Investigation here showed that habitation extended from the tenth century BC until (and perhaps including) the Hellenistic period. The fortification walls are visible to the south and southeast of the settlement and are preserved in places to 3m in height. Investigation in 2010-2011 showed that they were built in the emplekton style with flat stones. Based on pottery sherds found in the fill of the wall, their construction can be dated to the transition from the eighth to the seventh century BC. Within the fortified area, a rectangular built area that contained metal objects was investigated; it is still not clear whether it was a hearth. Outside and to the south of the fortification walls a retaining wall is preserved to a length of 8.8m (Wall T2); many pottery sherds and shells have been collected from its immediate vicinity. The location of the cemetery to the southeast of the settlement is suggested by the discovery of a pit grave, cut in the bedrock, that contained an inhumation burial and two squat lekythoi of the late fifth to early fourth century BC. The pottery and other finds from the settlement imply that it was inhabited from the tenth century BC. Based on the preliminary study of the pottery (presented by A. Alexandridou at the fourth AESThE), the peak of the settlement seems to have been during the tenth to eighth century. The pottery shapes and decoration reveal very close links to Lefkandi and Euboea as well as Thessaly (Marmariani). According to A. Mazarakis Ainian, the layout of the site on a plateau on a peninsula that lies between two harbours recalls other early sites in the Cyclades, such as Zagora on Andros. The site on Kephala was an important stop and a significant trading centre along a major trading sea route that linked Euboea and the southern Aegean with the harbours and sites of the north (Methoni, Karabournaki, Mende, Poseidi). Also inter esting is the discovery of plentiful pottery datable to the seventh and early sixth centuries, a period that is not well known in Thessaly or in the Sporades. Kraters and transport amphorae predominate, as well as Proto Corinthian and Corinthian pottery. From the mid-sixth century, as with other sites, Athenian black-figure pottery begins to predominate. The continuation of research on the site promises fruitful results regarding the Iron Age and the Early Archaic habitation on the island. In addition to the survey at Kephala, work was also conducted in the vicinity of Kephala, at Korakopholia, where farmhouses of the Classical period were located. As regards Skiathos town, in May 2012 the first systematic underwater exploration of Skiathos harbour took place under the supervision of the EMA in collaboration with the 13th EPCA, 7th EBA and A. Ginalis (Oxford). Among the areas explored were the old port of Skiathos, Bourtzi and the Kechria area. In the area around the ancient port, which equates to the modem harbour of Skiathos, an ancient breakwater that coincided with a Byzantine jetty was revealed. Among the plentiful pottery fragments collected from the area of the old harbour were two complete vessels of the Late Classical period and two lamps of the fourth and sixth centuries AD; also among the finds was a marble fragment that bears relief decoration of an acanthus leaf, of Late Roman date. At Tarsanades, clusters of finds belonging to the cargo of a shipwreck of Late Roman date were recorded; a further shipwreck of Byzantine date with a cargo consisting of cover roof tiles and amphorae was identified closer to the old harbour. Finally, a third shipwreck, of Late Roman date was discovered by the Platania cove. Although still in its early stages, the recent work on Kephala and the harbour of Skiathos town (ancient Skiathos) confirms the importance of the island for maritime trade (press release of the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports 08.06.2012: http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp? obj_id=50872; Tachydromos 17.06.2012: http://www. taxydromos.gr/ article.php?id=49527&amp;cat=713). m* * 151.

Mazarakis Ainian.</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 93 Alonissos, ancient Ikos Between 2001 and 2003, rescue excavations and survey on Alonissos brought to light interesting information about the settlements on the island. On the Kokkinokastro peninsula, situated between the bays of Vythisma and Tzortzis, north of the islet of Mikro Kokkinokastro, lies a settlement identified with ancient Ikos. The site is very eroded by the sea and much of its south face has collapsed. The dense vegetation occupying the plateau does not allow a detailed plotting of the visible architectural remains that belong to buildings. Habitation on the plateau was on successive terraces, making use of the sloping terrain. Pottery on the surface is plentiful and dated to the fourth century BC. Two parts of the fortification enceinte protecting the site were inves tigated and plotted (Fig. 152). The southern one is 2.58m wide. The outer face has collapsed into the sea, but the inner face is preserved, to a length of 97m. The eastern side of the walls was revealed to a length of 36m, and is better preserved, to a height of 1.80-1.83m (E. Skafida in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 533-34). About 800m west of Kokkinokastro, on the northern slopes of the hill at Mnemata, lies the cemetery of the settlement. It is an organized cemetery in use during the Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods, with successive layers of burial. Three graves were revealed in 2003, two pits of Hellenistic to Roman date and a cist grave of Classical date. At a deeper level, in the Classical period layer, the remains of a building covered with roof tiles and containing Classical period pottery was found in proximity to the graves (E. Skafida and A. Karakatsanis in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 537-38). In the chora of ancient Ikos, about 2km to its west, at Raches, rescue excavation revealed an ancient apsidal building with pottery of the Classical period and re-used architectural material. Survey at the site revealed an installation of the Classical period, near a water source and commanding important road junctions. The apsidal building, 5m in length and 4m in width, contained pottery of the Classical period. In the vicinity, walls belonging to buildings/roofed areas were plotted. The discovery of pottery, loomweights and other finds suggests that they were used for the production and storage of food and produce (E. Skafida and A. Karakatsanis in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 535-36). Also related to agricultural exploitation of the land was the farmhouse installation at Garbitses, which was further explored in 2001 (Fig. 153). It was a fortified farmhouse, round in plan (7.85m in diameter) and preserved in three courses. In the immediate vicinity, walls belonging to buildings of rectangular plan suggest habitation in four successive terraces and continuous use of the site for farm activities from the Classical through to the Byzantine period (E. Skafida in ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 535-36). Conclusions In focusing on certain parts of Thessaly, this review has inevitably omitted finds such as, for example, the Neolithic deposits at Palioskala near Karla and in western Thessaly (Ermitsi, Sykeon) as well as the LHITTII finds at Makrychori and in western Thessaly, which merit serious consideration. For the Early Iron Age and the transition to the Archaic period, the survey at Kephala on Skiathos and the recent finds from Pharsala, Halos and Gephyria (possibly ancient Thetonion) considerably aid our understanding of the 152.

The Archaic period per se is not as well documented in Thessaly, especially with regards to mortuary archaeology. The recent excavation at Phylla Giolia, near Omolio, provides a very interesting burial group that allows us to compare burial practices here with those of other Thessalian sites and detect common patterns (cremation in urns, marking of graves with simple stone slabs) throughout the region. The large-scale salvage archaeology that has been undertaken in the Valley of Tempe (as part of the works for the national road E75), the Karla region (in restoring Lake Karla) and in western Thessaly (due to the widening of the E65) has added much to our understanding of the diachronic history of these regions. In the case of western Thessaly, it has led to the identification of ancient cities with excavated settlements (at Ermitsi/ancient Peirasies, Myrine/ancient Methylion, Pyrgos Matarangas/ancient Kierion) and the discovery of important new sites/sanctuaries in a region that was considered a backwater. The discovery of workshop installations (kilns, glass workshops, etc.) at various sites adds to our knowledge of artisanal activity in Thessaly (Geometric period kilns at Halos, kilns of Hellenistic and Roman date at Metropolis, and of Early Christian date at Aerani near Lake Karla: ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 614-19, 626-27). The workshop installations (Kastro/Palaia Volou, Demetrias - glass manufacture? - Trikala), quarries (Valley of Tempe, Atrax) and inns (Pherae, Demetrias) offer very useful information on the economic activities of the inhabitants of the region.</page><page sequence="94">94 MARIA STAMATOPOULOU In the case of the northern Sporades, the survey at Kephala has provided us with an important new site, of the first half of the first millennium BC, that served as a major trading centre and a stop along the sea-route that led to the north, and has demonstrated the vitality of Euboean enter prise in the Aegean during the Early Iron Age. The recent maritime exploration of the harbour area of modem Skiathos is very promising and may lead to a better under standing of the economic and strategic importance of the island and the Sporades, and their place in an important maritime trade network. Equally interesting is the discovery and investigation of numerous farmhouses dating from the Classical through to the Byzantine period. In the absence of intensive surveys in the region (notable exceptions being those at Kastro Kallitheas, Halos) they provide significant new evidence for the exploitation of the countryside, agricul tural activities and, when studied in relation to urban archaeology, for diachronic changes of settlement patterns in a given area. Examples of recently identified farmhouses include those at Amygdali Agias, Kalamaki (ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Chr B2 549-51) and Kazanaki Volou, in the Sourpi plain at Touvla. The recent archaeological activity has demonstrated the importance, variability and richness of the material evidence dating to the Roman period, especially that of the second and third centuries AD, and the period of transition from the Late Roman to the Byzantine period (fourth to fifth century AD). Bath complexes with elaborate mosaic floors, luxurious private houses, parts of public buildings and fortifications, and farmhouses scattered across the countryside have been found throughout the region and not just in the major centres such as Larisa, Phthiotic Thebes at Nea Anchialos, Demetrias and Trikke. Despite some recent communications (for example by Skafida and Triantaphyllopoulou at the third AEThSE on the Demetrias-Volos area; Karapanou on Pharsala at the fourth AEThSE', Leventi on Roman period relief tombstones; Gialouri on Late Roman to Early Christian Larisa; Sdrolia on the Velika region; and O. Karagiorgou's 2001 Oxford thesis on the economy of the region in late antiquity), Roman Thessaly is still virtually unknown and could prove a fruitful topic for further study.

This was a fair reflection of the reduced number of reports and publications available for the region in the calendar year 2011. This year's report on Macedonia and Thrace focuses on a number of emerging trends, as well as providing a partial overview of current projects, based on new reports that have been made available and on a summary of the relevant Ephoreia surveys in the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports' compilation for the last decade (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes). The Ministry's publication showcases medium- and long-term projects in the region, many of which have already received more detailed notice in past volumes of AR, through extended press notices or interim reports published annually in AEMTh. So the online album provides some new material and images on Madedonia and Thrace. However, the decennial review of work by the Ephoreias coincides with the publication of a number of books and an exhibition catalogue, which together offer an opportunity to reflect on trends and achievements over a longer time phase. Details of a limited number of projects conducted in 2011 in Macedonia and Thrace were available as authored reports or edited for online access at the time when this synthesis was being prepared (reports that have normally been prepared by the EfA were incomplete). It seems sensible, therefore, to review the available material alongside broader reflections on a geographical basis, following the work of individual Ephoreias and their areas, rather than to present a straightforward chrono logical review of the last 12 months. Publications 2012 has witnessed the publication of a captivating photo graphic album (Muller and Mulliez [2012]), celebrating the work of the Ecole française d'Athènes on the island of Thasos. The School's archive has been re-explored to highlight key moments of the island's excavation history, a salutary reminder of how formidable were the practical as well as political obstacles in the earliest days of research and how rewarding the results. The excellent range of historic images gives a taste of the material poten tially available for research of the island's modem histori ography, as well as possible new directions for fieldwork and research. Besides AEMTh, another journal dedicated to the far north of Greece has recently emerged, Archaiologiko Ergo stin Ano Makedonia (AEAM), whose first volume (for 2009) appeared too late for inclusion in last year's AG. A number of items referred to below are reported in volume 1. This publication reflects the expansion of research and rescue work in western Macedonia, including upland areas that have hitherto been the subject of study primarily amongst early prehistorians, anthropologists and historians of later periods. The marked increase in the number of sites identified in this upland area and the number of artefacts collected during research and rescue give some indication of the potential that the districts of'Upper Macedonia' offer. Last year I referred to the fact that archaeological information is still comparatively under-exploited by historians, with reference to the new Blackwell's A Companion to Ancient Macedonia (Roisman and Worthington [2010]). Another synthesis on Classical Macedonia, published by Brill, and edited by Robin Lane Fox, appeared in 2011, which competes with the former only in part of its coverage (Lane Fox [2011]). One important difference between the two volumes is the space given to the archaeological heritage of Macedonia in the Brill volume, and I will refer to individual chapters below. Joseph Roisman and Ian Worthington cover the period broadly between the sixth century BC and the incorpo ration of Macedonia as a Roman province, with later chapters covering the Imperial age and Late Antiquity. The thematic chapters nevertheless give significantly more space to the Classical than to any other historical period. Lane Fox focuses on the sixth to fourth century BC, while his contributors have adopted a broader time frame. Thus Chaido Koukouli-Chrysanthaki provides overviews of Amphipolis (409-36) and Philippi (437-52) that trace these cities from the time of their historical foundations, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC respec tively, well into the period of the Roman Empire, while Polyxeni Adam-Veleni surveys Thessaloniki from before the time of Cassander's synoikismos to the time of the Emperor Theodosius; Thea Stefanidou-Tiveriou looks at Macedonian art under Roman rule (168 BC to AD 337) (563-84); and Dimitris J. Kyrtatas (585-99) provides a historical overview of early Christianity in Macedonia, though it is a pity that some account could not be taken of the funerary evidence associated with early Christianity in Thessaloniki, now highlighted again in the 16th Ephoreia's decennial report (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes 181-83; cf. also AR 55 [2008-2009] 59-60). All the 'archaeological' chapters provide excellent bibliographical resources related to recent work. Among the noteworthy additions to what is likely to become one of the most important resources on Macedonian civic architecture is the chapter by Angeliki Kottaridi on the palace at Aigai (297-333; cf. Kottaridi [2011]; AR 54 [2007-2008] 73; Saatsoglou-Paliadeli [2007]; ID822) (Fig. 154). Kottaridi's new interpretation of the structure and her dating of the principal outline of its construction to the reign of Philip II (cf. Drougou [2011] 248) are bound to stimulate debate, whilst full details of the stratigraphie data are yet to be published. Kottaridi's argument, accepted by other archaeologists excavating at the site, is that the palace and theatre should be studied together and were part of a single strategic design plan, beginning around the middle of the fourth century BC. The smaller, western palace complex appears, in the excavators' view, to have been the original nucleus, expanding with the construction of the much larger eastern complex, with its interior courtyard alone measuring ca. 2,000m2. The dining accommodation is the most striking aspect of the whole construction, with three large rooms that could accommodate up to 30 couches each, and many smaller rooms, arranged, it appears, in sets of three. Classical scholars have found it hard to accept that the Argead monarchs really were innovators in various cultural fields, rather than imitators of southern Greek, particularly Attic, fashions. These views must be revised, whatever the detailed chronologies of the palace complexes at Aigai and Pella eventually reveal.</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 97 154. Aigai: palace. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 17th EPCA. The introductory chapter in the Brill volume by Lane Fox focuses on the dating of Tomb 2 at Vergina, attributed by scholars either to Philip II and one of his latest wives (whether Kleopatra or Meda) or to Philip III Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydike (Lane Fox [2011] 1-34). The author's arguments build on his own earlier publications as well as an important review of the evidence by Miltiades Hatzopoulos in 2008. Both Flatzopoulos and Lane Fox aim to respond to the arguments put forward by a number of scholars in favour of Philip III Arrhidaeus and Eurydike, which were brought together in a long and ambitious article by Eugene Borza and Olga Palagia (2007), but which appeared too late for Hatzopoulos' piece. Borza and Palagia, whilst approaching the subject from different perspectives, both, nevertheless favour the case for Philip III and his wife Eurydike as the occupants of Tomb 2. Hatzopoulos provides a clear, dramatic and generously referenced account of the contro versy and of the changing views of some of the principal contributors to the discussion. Hatzopoulos (2008) and Lane Fox (2011) explore the wide range of historical and art historical arguments that have been deployed over more than 30 years, either to back Andronikos' original dating of the tomb or to reject it. The former chose the 30th anniversary of the excavation of the tomb as a moment of reflection, building on the publication of the frieze and other architectural aspects of Tomb 2 by Chrysoula Saatsoglou-Paliadeli in 2004 and of the ceramic finds by Stella Drougou in 2005. Hatzopoulos placed significant emphasis on the forensic analysis of the human bones and on the architectural history of the tomb itself, which was not constructed as a single commission, but shows evidence of having been composed in at least two stages, with the ante-chamber following the main chamber after an indeterminate interval. Lane Fox, on the other hand, attempts to demolish the arguments of Borza and Palagia, which were partially refuted by Hatzopoulos in 2008. Lane Fox is himself the co-author of an important new paper, in which the forensic team of Jonathan Musgrave, Richard Neave and John Prag, along with Hugh White (2010), re-examine the suggestion put forward by A. Bartsiokas in 2000 that the skeletons in Tomb 2 were burned dry and that other features of the bone evidence are more consistent with the main corpse having been that of Philip III Arrhidaeus. For anyone less than fully engaged with the significance of the various discussions about dating and identity, this new paper may seem rather technical, especially when compared with the kinds of arguments that have populated the vast literature that has accrued over the last 30 years on this subject. However, Musgrave and his colleagues provide by far the most convincing scientific data that have been marshalled over the same period. Architecture, iconography, royal regalia and ceramics are ultimately material manifestations that do not lend themselves at all easily to precise dating. In the case of a royal burial - and no serious argument has ever been put forward to suggest that Tomb 2 was not royal - we might expect exceptional objects of many kinds, which by definition cannot be dated in the same sort of way that standard items can be. In terms of significant objects, I should also mention the remarkable iron pectoral, with its gilded silver cover, decorated with stamped geometric and vegetal patterns, which has a different set of associations from those of other objects identified in the main burial and, like the gold bow case, poses new questions about the cultural dimensions of the</page><page sequence="98">98 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD tomb's occupants that have hitherto not attracted as much interest among scholars as some of the other finds (see Archibald [1985]). Musgrave and his colleagues' rearticulation of the forensic evidence, with important experimental details concerning the time required for a corpse to become fully defleshed in order to qualify as a 'dry' corpse, make it clear that Arrhidaeus and Eurydike must have been exhumed and cremated before being brought back to Vergina by Cassander. The forensic case for the occupant of Tomb 2 being Philip II remains as good as it was in 1984, when Prag, Musgrave and Neave published the findings of their systematic and searching analysis of the skeletal material. Musgrave and Prag (2011) have written a short piece for the Ashmolean catalogue edited by A. Kottaridi and S. Walker, outlining the principal arguments of the 2010 article. The pyre on top of Tomb 2 has played only a very minor role in the arguments about the dating of the tomb and its occupants. Visitors to the reconstructed and conserved tomb at Vergina will have seen the remains of the pyre on display and marvelled at the quantities of material that were consigned to the flames. The animals sacrificed at the same time have recently been discussed by T. Antikas, in particular the horse remains (2006). This study has not been cited in any of the recent publications on Vergina and deserves to be better known. The exhibition catalogue that accompanied the display of Macedonian material in the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Oxford (Kottaridi and Walker [2011]) is the fruit of a collaboration between the Museum and the then Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism, with the 17th EPCA. Some of the contributors to the catalogue also contribute to the Brill volume (Lane Fox on Macedonian history ca. 650-336 BC; Hatzopoulos on Macedonian royal and political institutions; Kottaridi on Macedonian legend, on queens and princesses at the Macedonian court, on burials at Aigai, on royal banquets and an Appendix on the palace at Aigai; Kremydi on coinage; Drougou on metallurgy; Lilibaki-Akamati on Pella). There are also new contributors: Yannis Galanakis on 160 years of archaeological investigation at Aigai; Elena Kountouri on Mycenaean evidence in Macedonia; Ioannes Graekos on trade and on war and hunting; Harikleia Brekoulaki on painting; and Susan Walker completes the volume with a comparative study of kaisareia, the ambitious architectural complexes of the Roman East that seem to have been inspired by the royal palaces at Aigai and Pella. The Ashmolean catalogue provides excellent photo graphs of many of the finds from Vergina, which formed the exhibition, as well as items recently conserved, including fragments from the gold and ivory couches in Tomb 2 (34, fig. 29; cf. ivory board from a footstool: 78, fig. 61) and the magnificent grave goods of a queen, dated ca. 500 BC (97, figs 112-24, 270, cat. nos 328-39). There is a well-marked, coloured plan of the excavated area in and around the acropolis, the city walls (Fig. 155), the exposed civic remains and cemeteries at Aigai (154, fig. 172; this plan is shown upside down in the Brill volume, with different annotations). The plan is published in a recent report (Kontogoulidou [2007]; ID2235) on new finds in the necropolis of Aigai, where 37 new burials were recovered from an area of 400m2, of which 30 belong to the Archaic period. Regions and regionalism The attentive reader of these new book-length publications on Macedonia looks in vain for a survey of sites and for any regional topographical explorations. Where were the people of Macedonia? What part did they play in the events that made Macedonia a name of global signifi cance? The Brill volume, like the Blackwell Companion and the Ashmolean catalogue, documents dynastic, not regional history. In this respect Nicholas Hammond's first and second volumes of A History of Macedonia remain the only academic reference work that attempts to survey Macedonia as a territorial entity over time. The Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports' decennial publication (www.yppo.gr/O/anaskafes) is presented according to Ephoreia bundles which more or less coincide with the new administrative regions that came into force in January 2011 (i.e. this differs somewhat from the previous organi zation of AG). Historical works usually distinguish between 'upper' and Tower' Macedonia, with various ways of describing the territories conquered by Philip II and not directly incorporated into the Argead kingdom. Hatzopoulos' term, 'the new territories', has the merit of emphasizing the temporal nature of political power in the areas east of the Axios from the second half of the fourth century BC onwards. The new administrative divisions locate Pieria and Imathia in central Macedonia (rather than western Macedonia, as in former editions of AG), along with Serres, so that the division between central and eastern Macedonia/Thrace runs west and north of Mount Pangaion. Fiorina, Grevena, Kastoria, and Kozani are now grouped with Epiros into the region of western Macedonia and Epiros. 155.

Makrygialos: goods from tomb 5, one of 20 graves excavated during rescue work in 2010. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 27th EPCA. The section on the 27th EPCA's work in Pieria perhaps inevitably covers a fraction of the work that has been carried out in the region during the decade covered by the report. The huge expansion of development work west of Thessaloniki, with the construction of the new Egnatia Odos (Fig. 156), the improvement of the road and railway connections along the Pierian coast (see the contributions to Tsouna [2008]) and urban growth at many key locations, has led to a vast growth in dataseis and finds in Pieria. Of the sites included, Methoni deserves promi nence in the year when a major monograph appeared as an e-book, published with exemplary speed and care by Manthos Bessios, Yannis Tzifopoulos and Antonis Kotsonas (2012), presenting the ceramic finds and graffiti (see also ID493; Bessios [2010]) (Figs 157-59). Methoni was the subject of a conference in Thessaloniki on 8-9 June 2012. Titled Panhellenes at Methoni, its core was the corpus of nearly 200 graffiti on pottery, almost all of the period ca. 725-680 BC, from a huge pit of unknown purpose on the acropolis of the site, situated immediately south of the then mouth of the Haliakmon river. All but 25 of the marks are non-alpha betic, and the vast majority - very many numerical - is on a range of transport amphorae. The closest comparable . % &gt; 0 3 157.

The alphabetic texts raised much debate, with a clear preference for seeing most as Euboean. They are almost all owners' inscriptions of some kind, including one in iambic verse on a skyphos and another, although fragmentary, clearly of a similar purport to the message on Tateie's lekythos from Cumae. Systematic excavations at the site of ancient Methoni (first identified in 1970 as located between two hills north of modern Nea Agathoupolis, ca. 35km south of Thessaloniki) have been in progress since 2004. It is often considered, on the basis of ancient reports, to be the earliest known settlement of 'southern' Greeks on the northern shores of the Aegean and its harbour is considered to have been the safest landfall in the Thermaic Gulf, before the silting up of the estuaries of the main arterial rivers, the Haliakmon, the Loudias and the Axios. The evidence from excavation does indicate that Methoni became the principal commercial and craft production centre, along the western coast at least, in the Early Iron Age. On the other hand, the actual role of newcomers from the south in the development of Methoni has yet to be clarified, since the trading activities showcased in the new book (Bessios et al. [2012]) emerged within an indigenous settlement that already had a history over many thousands of years. Neolithic activity on the eastern hill began in the sixth millennium BC and was succeeded, apparently without interruption, throughout the Bronze Age, while a Late Bronze Age cemetery has been located on the western, the higher of the two hills. During the Early Iron Age the settlement extended onto both hills. The excavations at Methoni offer an opportunity to rethink the framework of 'colonizing' activities in the region, much as those at Torone have helped to enlarge our understanding of long term interactions between 'north' and 'south' on the Chalcidic peninsula. The history of Methoni as a major focus of regional and inter-regional exchange was affected by the silting up of the three great estuaries to the north of it. The geomor phology of the Thermaic Gulf has been subjected to a number of recent studies, which now provide a more coherent thesis to explain how the surface geography of the coastal plain came to have the appearance that it now has. The alluvial and colluvial silting of the coastal landscape began much earlier than has usually been assumed, beginning in Neolithic times, and accelerated from the Bronze Age onwards (Ghilardi et al. [2008]). Results of an investigation of two public buildings at Methoni during 2011 could indicate that the inhabitants took refuge there during the siege of the city by Philip II in 354 BC (ID2701). This is the interpretation suggested by the large quantities of every-day pottery and a series of hearths inside the buildings (Aggelioforos tis Kyriakis 26.02.12). The report of the 27th EPCA (www.yppo.gr/0/ anaskafes 187-92) also includes a short account of some of the country-house estates that have been among the most striking new forms of settlement to have emerged from work related to development projects in the last decade, notably Komboloi and Tria Platania (Fig. 160). These are among the sites presented in a fair amount of detail, and generously illustrated, in the book edited by P. Adam-Veleni, E. Poulaki and K. Tzanavari, and published with admirable speed in 2003. Adam-Veleni also wrote a long report for the 20th anniversary volume of AEMTh, arguing that at least some of these country farms presage the development of slave-run villa estates (Adam-Veleni [2009]). The accounts published so far indicate that the scale of the Hellenistic country houses does not corre spond to that envisaged for an intensively-managed estate run to generate high revenues. However, the range of properties currently undergoing investigation means that it will soon be possible to say a good deal more about the organization of a range of estates dating from the period of Roman occupation, particularly about the large number of such estates identified in the area of Thessaloniki. Adam Veleni lists 14 that post-date the Roman conquest of Macedonia. Examples of such country houses have also been identified in the Haliakmon valley. At Agios Konstantinos an area of 6,475m2 was excavated, revealing a Hellenistic house (Building A) in the northern sector composed of 11 rooms around a central courtyard focusing on a paved area (ID2724). A destruction deposit above this comprised Corinthian-type tiles and mortar. The walls were carefully constructed of small dressed stone courses, superimposed by unbaked brick and covered with plaster inside and out. Entry into the building was on the southeast corner of Room A. There was probably a second entrance opposite, in Room la. A storage pithos was buried in the floor of Room B, which is north of Room A. Polychrome marble decorated the interior walls. This decoration, as well as a circular table and assorted iron nails found in Rooms B and T, suggest to the excavators that each of these rooms may have been an andron (Karamitrou-Mentesidi [2009b]). Both rooms face onto the courtyard. Room A to the north contained nine pithoi 1.1m in diameter, and should be identified as a storage room on a large scale (pitheonas). In the destruction deposit of Room E, on the west, a coin of the Thessalian League was discovered (196 BC), showing the head of Apollo and the image of Athena Itonia and the inscription [0]ESZA-AfiN on the reverse. One of the smaller rooms off the courtyard has a pebbled floor. Room la has been identified as a kitchen (optanion), judging by the circular hearth and large quantities of pottery. A rectangular ceramic kiln (3 x 3.5m) was constructed on the ruined eastern wall of Room I, with the stoke hole on the east. Unusually, the exterior walls were built of stone, while the interior ones were of the more normal brick, with six brick pillars in the fire chamber. Kiln furniture was also found outside the kiln structure. I have already mentioned the growing importance of discoveries in 'upper' Macedonia. The district of Kozani has been one of the most intensively investigated areas of Greece during the last few decades. The expansion of the modem city of Edessa has revealed a wide range of sites, of all historical periods, while conservation work in the centre of the city has secured a well-preserved focus around the southern sector of the ancient fortification wall (Fig. 161). The number of registered sites in the Kozani district has risen to close on 500, with the recovery of many thousands of finds. Among these, the range of multi-period sites in the middle Haliakmon valley, investi gated in advance of the Ilarion Dam project, represent one extremely valuable group of datasets. Some of the individual sites with early prehistoric evidence are discussed below. Of particular significance are multi period sites, such as Polymylos (identified as ancient</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 101 160.

ID474), and Longkas Elatis (Fig. 162), where prehistoric finds have been discovered alongside Hellenistic ones, as well as a Mycenaean-type sword. There is an important site, possibly a sanctuary, spanning the period between the seventh and sixth centuries BC at Akrites (ID1167), in the far west of the Kastoria district, an unusually rich cemetery of the Classical period at Keramario Paliourias (ID2192) (Figs 163-65), in the valley of the Haliakmon, Late Classical remains at Anarrachi (ID1985; see now Karamitrou Mendesidi [2009c]) and a Hellenistic settlement with a bathing complex at Vromoneria Panaghias (ID2190) (Fig. 166). Twenty-five HL graves were discovered during rescue excavations at Ai Markos, Mavropigi. Coins of Cassander, Demetrios Poliorcetes and Antigonos Gonatas were among the grave goods. These burials help to put into context chance finds made since 1970. The contents show that eight of the unlooted burials belong to women. Some graves contained more than one burial. Aside from one Early Iron Age tomb, the rest could be dated in the fourth and third centuries BC. There was an associated settlement in the nearby Kastro (Karamitrou-Mendesidi [2009c]). 162.

Vromoneria Panaghias: aerial view. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 30th EPCA. Twenty-four tombs dating from the Archaic and Hellenistic periods were recovered south of the western sector of Diporo, Haliakmon, in 2009, over an area of 200m2 (ID2722). These were mainly extended inhuma tions in pit graves (apart from one cist and two enchy tris moi), three of the deceased being laid on a bed of pebbles. Two of the pit graves were delimited by stones and one was covered with a slab. Six of the graves belonged to children. Tomb 52 contained a bronze lebes with a child's cremation, covered by a stone slab, the grave being covered by a mass of clay. Among the grave goods were two bronze pins, two fibulae and other finds dateable to the fourth century BC. Six graves contained exaleiptra and were dateable to the end of the sixth to the fifth century BC. Men were accompanied by spearheads, women by vases with silver and bronze jewellery. Two or possibly three Classical burials contained a black-figure lekythos, black-gloss pottery, an iron sword and bronze jewellery. Five other graves were Hellenistic in date (Karamitrou-Mendesidi [2009a]). At Panagia Diporou two new horse skeletons, with metal ornaments, were recovered, belonging to the Hellenistic phase, along with bronze fibulae and a bronze ring, depicting a horse (Karamitrou-Mendesidi [2009a]). Investigation of a 26ha area northwest of Thessaloniki during 2011 revealed 199 burials belonging to the western cemetery of the 'trapeza'/table mound of Polichni. Fifty four enchytrismoi were of Early Iron Age date, there were four substantial Classical tombs, fifty-one of Hellenistic date and 11 Late Roman. Grave goods were in all cases rich (Ethnos 29.02.12). Fieldwork in the Thasos agora in 2011 focused on the putative bouleuterion - the so-called Édifice en tuf (Grandjean and Salviat [2000] 11) - located in the northwest angle of the agora, between the northwest portico and the building with paraskenia (ID2647). The area was thoroughly cleaned and an analysis conducted of the structure's building phases. To the latest phase belongs the marble toichobate, as do the tufa walls and the semicir cular wall of marble ashlar slabs. This structure can now be seen as the successor of an earlier building/s, whose walls were identified below. The immediate predecessor of the Edifice en tuf consisted of a complex of rooms, with a pair of rooms facing the agora, behind which was a row of five, narrower inner chambers. This structure had in turn been preceded by a structure raised on three external walls, made of polygonal masonry. The research project initiated in 2004 to study system atically epigraphic documents on the island of Thasos, both documents that have been deposited in the Museum of Thasos and those in the field, continued through 2011 (cf. AR 54 [2007-2008] 85). The first area to be explored is the northeast corner of the agora, with the adjacent civic structures, under the direction of J.-Y. Marc (EfA/Strasbourg). A new study of documents in the Museum, connected with the planned Corpus of Thasian inscriptions (under the direction of J. Founder, P. Hamon and N. Trippé [EfA]), focused on the civic archon list. Architectural masonry belonging to two sctructures was examined, an unidentified building finished in white marble (the bouleuterion?) and the structure with paraskenia. It was found that two inscribed blocks from the archon list probably belong to the same level. One of the more extensive reports in the decennial album (www.yppo.gr/0/anaskafes) is that of the 18th EPCA. A combination of development and regular excavations has produced a wide range of studies, from the multi-period site (with Early Bronze Age activities underlying a Classical and Roman settlement) at Perni to 46 burials at Phagres, including a Late Bronze Age pithos</page><page sequence="104">104 ZOSIA ARCHIBALD burial, as well as a clay sarcophagus from the late fifth century BC and a variety of other graves from the second half of the fourth century BC. Following the direction of the Egnatia Odos west of Abdera, a series of 50 graves was recovered, mainly of Roman date, but also including some from the second century BC and four Neolithic pit graves. At Akontisma, the well-preserved fortification walls of the acropolis of a settlement in the mountains above Nea Karvali have been exposed (Fig. 167) (ID423; cf. AR 53 [2006-2007] 72). The first construction phase of the walls is dated by imported Thasian amphorae and bronze coins of Cassander (316-297 BC). A second hill-top site, west of Nea Karvali, was inhabited between the late sixth and mid-fourth century BC, and is thought to have been set up to exploit the timber and metal reserves further inland. The panorama of recently explored sites includes Neos Skopos (ancient Berge: 2000-2003) and Argilos, where the synergasia between the Ephoreia and the Canadian Institute of Archaeology has revealed paved streets running up from the late sixth-century BC harbour wall, other contemporary structures in the town and a Hellenistic rectangular house on the hill-top (Fig. 168). At Platanias a stone períbolos has yielded traces of activity from the Late Neolithic to the sixth century AD. On Samothrace, recent work outside the Sanctuary of the Great Gods has focused on the Late Neolithic to Bronze Age site at Mikro Vouni, near the southwestern coastline, an Early Iron Age fortified upland site at Vrychos and the open-air sanctuary of Madul - Panaghi, as well as an ethno-archaeological survey of the island (Matsas [2009]; [2010]). Bronze Age sealings with Minoan-type symbols, including identifiable Linear A pictograms, as well as a disc-shaped balance weight, point to significance maritime contacts in a period that is still poorly understood in the island's history. Early Iron Age pottery at Vrychos indicates close connections between Samothrace, Thasos (Kastri IIB2) and the north Aegean coastline, including sites like Kastanas, while the presence of megalithic tombs at Vrychos and at other island locations (Gialomandra, Sellada, Vigía) suggests cultural links with the mainland opposite. The native population seems to have been progressively Hellenized, in linguistic terms at least. The preponderance of non-Hellenic graffiti between the seventh and fifth centuries BC was super seded by Greek ones thereafter. Early prehistoric sites Among the most interesting new sites that have emerged from development projects are those that continue to expand the range of evidence about the earliest human history of the north. The 18th EPCA has found a mid sixth-millennium BC site at Limenaria, Thasos (succeeded by Early Bronze Age stone-built structures) and a fourth millennium BC site, including hearths and domestic equipment, but also two burials, at Agios Ioannis Theologou (Fig. 169). The 31st EPCA has inves tigated traces of Late Neolithic activity at Laphrouda, Abdera, dating to the mid-sixth millennium BC. At Panagia Diporou there were pits containing Late Neolithic pottery, resembling Macedonian matt-painted forms (Karamitrou-Mendesidi [2009a]). Bronze Age traces have recently been discovered at Foufa, Kouri, near Anarrachi, in Eordaia. In the Drama area a Middle Neolithic site has been investigated at Arkadikos, with traces of post-built, apsidal-ended houses. 167.

Papadopoulos (18th EPCA) at Agios Antonios, near the village of Poto on Thasos. Nine struc tures were revealed, built on stone foundations with an unbaked brick superstructure, and clay interior and exterior installations, in the adjacent courtyards. These rectangular houses, with apsidal ends, date from the fourth millennium BC (3900-3600 BC). There is local incised and stamped pottery of the third and second millennia BC,</page><page sequence="105">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 105 as well as fragments of Minyan and Mycenaean pottery, indicating exchange with more southerly centres. A deep shaft contained a flexed inhumation burial, accompanied by a pot (To Bima 20.03.12 http://www.tovima.gr/ culture/article/?aid=449 532; http://utopia.duth.gr/~ efpapad/anaskafes/agios_ antonios/keimena.html). Field survey in the mountainous region of Grevena in 2009, under the direction of N. Evstratiou (Thessaloniki) and P. Biagi (Venice), focused on the area around Smolika, above 2,300masl, northwest of Samarina. Traces of Middle Palaeolithic activity were recorded. The site was occupied seasonally and lay close to water sources and flint beds (ID2721; Evstratiou and Biagi [2009]). At Kleitos, northeast of Kozani, rescue excavations revealed a Neolithic site (now known as Kleitos 1) surrounded by a palisade and ditches, within which were ten house structures built of packed clay, reinforced with branches (ID1976). This is one of the sites where destruction by fire has preserved elaborate geometric patterns on the exterior of the house units (see AR 57 [2010-2011] 88-89). Three phases have been identified. The interior arrangement of the houses has also been remarkably preserved, with hearths, tables and ovens, while outside were pens for animals and clay storage vessels. Sixteen burials were also recovered, including animal offerings beside the human remains, along with lustrous pottery decorated with zoomorphic patterns, anthropo morphic figurines and spondylus shells (spondylus gaederopus), clay stamps and stone tools. A second site, Kleitos 2, was discovered some way to the northeast of Kleitos 1 (0.025ha in area), on a low hill close to a spring. Two phases were identified here, one Late Neolithic and one Final Neolithic. Domestic structures include rounded and rectangular forms. The architecture resembled that of Kleitos 1, in addition to which there was a paved area at the centre of the settlement, ditches on the southern side and a retaining wall south of the stream. Three flexed inhumations and three inurned cremations completed the evidence (dating from the final phase). A curved ditch belonging to the Middle Bronze Age cut the Neolithic features in the southeastern sector, over a distance of ca. 60m. Large quantities of ceramic debris from domestic areas, and large clay storage vessels, were associated with the ditch. Traces of Late Bronze Age activity were found at Kleitos 1 (Chondrogianni-Metoki [2009]; Ziota [2009]). The botanical material from the Neolithic site at Mavropigi excavated in the 2005 and 2006 seasons has shown the presence of einkorn (triticum monococcum), other wheat varieties, including triticum dicoccum, barley (hordeum sp.), lentils and wild fruits. Large quantities of triticum dicoccum and barley were placed in the burials of a neonate and a youth (tombs 1 and 3), thought to be part of a mortuary rite (Valamoti [2009]) (Fig. 170). Prehistoric traces were found in 2009 at Diporo, Haliakmon, below the Byzantine cemetery (ID2722). A house built on an elliptical plan (4.2m maximum length) was preserved up to two stone courses. Two other struc tures were also identified as houses, varying between 2.2 and 3.5m in diameter. Pottery, tools and flint flakes were also recovered. A stone construction, 10m in length and 3.2m wide, seems to have been an encircling períbolos wall. Course and burnished pottery, as well as a necklace of stone beads and three anthropomorphic figurines were found in close proximity (Karamitrou-Mentesidi [2009a]). Close to the chapel of Agios Konstantinos, Haliakmon, a series of stone cairns was recovered, along with a cist tomb, oriented east-west and containing a triple burial, belonging to two adults, placed back to back, and their child (ID2724; Karamitrou-Mentesidi [2009b]). Sherds of Mycenaean cups were found in the fill. The Bronze Age site of Kryopigado has been investi gated over an extensive area covering two hills (ID2730). Radiocarbon dating provides dates between 2570-2460 BC and 1300-1120 BC, from, in other words, the Early Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age. Twenty-nine post holes provide part of the layout of the site on the east hill, with semi-subterranean houses, between 3m and 22m2, accompanied by small storage pits. A ditch and three stone structures (?defensive) and three retaining terrace walls, also of stone, on the eastern slope, complete the main features. Pottery recovered includes storage and tableware, 151 stone tools, as well as implements for textile working and ornaments. Forty-two anchor-shaped figurines and 192 fragments of others give an indication of artistic products, whilst terracotta moulds for bronze axes point to other artefacts produced here. Similar traces of habitation were found on the eastern slope of the western hill (Karamitrou-Mendesidi and Lokana [2009]). Bibliography Adam-Velem, P.

Although mostly related to rescue-led archaeology, research is starting to reveal details of sites for all periods of the Byzantine era - small locations, of the kind to be found at the base of any site hierarchy, and sites that have so far only been just discernible (though still hard to characterize), as identified in the new 'ceramic landscapes' of the intensive surveys. The numerous small places that we should imagine at the base of Early, Middle and Late Byzantine site hierarchies will therefore be a particular feature of this section of 'Archaeology in Greece'. Discoveries will be presented in the same way as in last year's AR, in other words, divided chronologically between Early Byzantine (fourth to seventh century), Dark Age and Middle to Late Byzantine, and also thematically, whilst reflecting short-term shifts of focus in reporting and fieldwork. Besides a plethora of new references to agricultural complexes or installations, there has also been a surge in reports concerning Middle or Late Byzantine levels at urban sites and kastra. Regarding terminology, 'Early Byzantine' is substi tuted here for most of the reports' references to 'Late Roman', 'Late Roman/Early Byzantine', 'Palaeochristian' and 'Proto-Byzantine', except for the well-established description of pottery of the fourth to seventh century as 'Late Roman'. By the same token, when brief reports use the term 'Byzantine' they usually mean, in the context, 'Middle or Late Byzantine', but sometimes they mean simply 'post-Roman'. It may therefore be necessary to reproduce the term as 'Byzantine' to avoid a precision that is at present lacking. Early Byzantine Many of the typical phenomena of the archaeological trans formation of the Graeco-Roman into the Early Byzantine town or city have been documented. In Athens sections of a substantial spolia-built Early Byzantine phase of the walls have been excavated, including a rectangular tower (Fig. 171) at the junction of Adrianou and Diogenous Street, curtain wall on Adrianou Street (Fig. 172) and a probable gateway at the junction of Aiolou and Dexippou Street (Fig. 173). At ancient Corinth, on the eastern side of the city, the 25th EBA has excavated a section of the city walls, while the ASCSA has traced a (presumably) later phase thought to be of ca. AD 600 beside the Greek theatre. At Chania the 28th EBA has identified Early Byzantine phases of fortifications overlying the Hellenistic (Fig. 51). At Palaio Phrourio in the city of Kerkyra the 21st EBA's discovery of high-status buildings associated with two gold nomismata of Justin II (AD 565-578), a bronze coin of Maurice (AD 582-602) and sixth-century pottery indicates that this area (a natural acropolis after all) has an Early Byzantine phase. In Thessaloniki the 16th EPCA has explored another section of the historically recorded maritime wall, identifying the phase of ca. AD 620-630 which was intended to counter the Avaro-Slav threat (ID2707; cf. ID1971). This Early Byzantine phase is 1.9m thick. This means that four substantial phases (one Roman and three Byzantine) have now been identified archaeolog ically. Near Volos the 7th EBA has explored substantial 171.

This Early to Middle Byzantine site is to be distinguished, however, from the site of ancient Demetrias (see 'Thessaly' section). The transformation, adaptation or upkeep of agoras (for example agoras, streets, theatres) is traced by ongoing research-led excavations and in the rescue excavations in advance of Thessaloniki's metro. At Palaiopolis, site of the ancient city of Andros, but also of an Early Byzantine bishopric, the University of Athens continued in 2011 to excavate two phases of Early Byzantine churches which overlie parts of the Hellenistic agora. At Gortyn (capital of the Early Byzantine province of Crete) the SAIA continued in 2012 to explore evidence of the conversion of parts of the theatre of the Pythion into stables, comple menting evidence found in 2004. In the Roman forum of Athens part of the north side of a three-aisled Early Byzantine basilica was explored. In Thessaloniki, at the site of Agia Sophia metro station, excavations present a case-study of the maintenance of a marble paved street of the third century AD, which was still equipped with drainage and apparently functioning porticoes through to the sixth century, after which road surfaces were made of beaten earth (as elsewhere, of course, for instance at Gortyn). At ancient Corinth the ASCSA continued in 2011 to excavate a deposit of bovine bones (calculated to have weighed 10 tons at deposition) and a large deposit of imported Late Roman water jars, both in Early Byzantine levels, which indicate a significant change of use in the immediate vicinity of the Greek theatre. Were these deposits outside the Early Byzantine walls? Recent excavations, whilst recording the downgrading of Roman public baths, make clear the widespread construction of bath buildings in Early Byzantine urban contexts, even if their precise associations and origins remain to be determined. In Sparta the 5th EPCA estab lished that baths and an associated palaestra built under the Principate were only adapted to new uses after a late fourth-century destruction. In ancient Corinth the 25th EBA has explored two Early Byzantine bath complexes on the eastern side of the city in the Kraneion neighbourhood (intramural: a large one in which marble revetted floors and walls are preserved and a smaller one whose caldarium contained individual bath tubs: Fig. 174). At Argos the 4th EPCA has explored Early Byzantine baths 250m north of the agora, while the 25th EBA has explored Early Byzantine baths between the agora and an Early Byzantine insula to its south whose caldarium has marble clad benches and floor and polychrome mosaic mural decoration. In Athens an Early Byzantine phase of baths has been identified, whose Roman predecessor is thought to belong to the Gymnasium of Hadrian. Early Byzantine intramural housing is the focus of a collaboration between the EfA, P. Petrides (Athens) and the 12th EBA. At the Domus protobyzantin in the city of Thasos a major phase of adaptation is now assigned to the period ca. AD 400-450, followed, ca. AD 570 to the early seventh century, by low-status occupation, on the basis of the pottery. In Argos the 25th EBA has explored on Kallergi Street parts of an Early Byzantine house, one room of which had a mosaic floor while another contained evidence of a wine-press. At Mousga, Kyparissia, within the ancient city, a large residence, the final phase of which dates to the late fourth to early fifth century, has been partially excavated by the 38th EPCA, yielding much plain domestic pottery, many bronze coins, loomweights, parts of a decorated lamp and animal bones. Artisanal production in intramural contexts has been documented again in Thessaloniki, where in 2009-2010 an Early Byzantine glass workshop was found (AR 57 [2010-2011] 28). In 2010-2011 significant traces of mercury in an Early Byzantine context are interpreted as evidence of gold refining. 174.

At Sparta the Early Byzantine basilica excavated by the 5th EBA on Alkman Street is extramural. Numerous objects (pottery, metalwork, architectural sculpture, glass, coins, fresco and glass tesserae) and the mosaic paving are the basis for its provisional dating to the late fifth or early sixth century. At Thessaloniki excavations for the Dimokratias metro station (just outside the Early Byzantine western walls) have recently revealed an Early Byzantine basilica at the same depth as the Early Byzantine western cemetery, while in the centre of the city a peristyle court, with mosaics, a fountain and a marble staircase, is attributed to an Early Byzantine church (presumably with a monumental two-storeyed atrium). At Amphissa (ancient and Early Byzantine Amphissa) an Early Byzantine basilica has been explored by the 1st EBA. In the centre of ancient-to-Byzantine Photike, northwest Greece, the 8th EBA discovered an Early Byzantine basilica with mosaic floors beneath a Middle Byzantine church. The 8th EBA also excavated a three-aisled Early Byzantine basilica at Rachi Maroutsi, northwest of Photike, at the church of Agia Paraskevi, Palioklisi (Fig. 175). It is unclear whether this is the reported Early Byzantine church of Palioklisi, Photike. At Agios Dimitrios on the edge of modern Same, Kephallonia, the 20th EBA partially excavated an Early Byzantine basilica which it would be reasonable to assume was closely connected with the ancient town of Same (located nearby). It has three aisles, a narthex, an exonarthex and annexes on the south side, mosaic paving and a cruciform sunken space in the north transept (a form shared with many baptismal fonts of this era). At ancient Corinth the 25th EBA has discovered a three-aisled basilica of the first half of the sixth century and perhaps the remains of another, on the eastern side of the site (Kraneion). At Armenoi, Demos of Armenoi, Crete, the 21s' EBA has identified an Early Byzantine basilica with a mosaic paving of the second half of the sixth century underneath a Middle Byzantine church. Extramural housing and cemeteries (situated outside the frequently reduced-defended areas of towns) are the subjects of several new reports. Extensive rescue excava tions at Sparta by the 5th EBA around Alkman Street have demonstrated that there was significant Early Byzantine habitation outside the city walls. Early Byzantine cemeteries, or phases of multi-period cemeteries, have also been identified there. The 5th EBA's excavations show that a major ancient cemetery on the southwest side of the city was in use from Hellenistic times to the fifth century AD. South of ancient Corinth, on the slopes of Acrocorinth, two Early Byzantine cemeteries have been explored by the 25th EBA, one of which is 90m southeast of the Quadratus Basilica (Fig. 176). Remains of more than 1,000 skeletons were found in cist graves that were being re-used, and which are believed to form part of a larger cemetery. A 'Byzantine' cemetery of unspecified chronology has also been found just outside the eastern section of the Early Byzantine city wall. The 37th EBA meanwhile reports 'Byzantine' graves in association with the ancient Long Walls linking Corinth and the Lechaion harbour. At Nafpaktos the 6th EPCA reports three clusters of Early Byzantine graves around the historic town, two of which are recognized as belonging to cemeteries. 175.

Corinth: Early Byzantine extramural cemetery. © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 25th EBA. If the urban archaeology of Early Byzantine towns and cities starts to correspond to recognizable themes and their variations, the archaeology of the Early Byzantine countryside has remained, at least until recently, a huge challenge, still largely resistant to synthesis between the approaches of different 'schools' of archaeology. The dominant approaches consist of the excavation of rural churches without specific contextualization; extensive survey of the 'monumental landscape' (essentially rural churches and fortifications); and the identification of 'ceramic landscapes' on the basis of evidence from multi period intensive surveys. It could be argued that many of the recently-reported excavations of features of the Early Byzantine countryside of Greece, nearly all 'rescue'-led, are potentially beneficial developments for the integration and interpretation of the data generated by the three dominant approaches, including the often architec turally defined excavations and surveys of rural churches. On Spetses the 1st EBA excavated an Early Byzantine church with (implicitly) three aisles and a narthex, which seems to have functioned until the end of the 17th century. At Laurion (where mining was resumed in the Early Byzantine era) the 1st EBA uncovered a fine mosaic floor in the bema of the basilica datable to the first half of the fifth century. In the district of Moschato between Piraeus</page><page sequence="110">110 ARCHIE DUNN and Athens the 26th EPCA has excavated on 25tb March Street a three-aisled basilica of the fifth century (presumably partially). This was a substantial monument (20m wide). At Agia Kyriake, Livanates, in Phthiotis, an Early Byzantine ecclesiastical complex with mosaic paving (Fig. 177) has been found whose destruction is attributed to the great earthquake of AD 551-552. According to Procopius, this did great damage in central Greece. On Crete at Kastelli, Demos of Kissamos, the 28th EBA has explored an ostotheke, east-west oriented graves containing grave goods of the sixth century and a circular building decorated with frescos and a mosaic floor containing Christian motifs, also of the sixth century. It is unclear whether a projecting apse has been found. Circular churches ('rotundas') are archaeologically uncommon in this period in both the East and West. The few known examples are very high-status in origin, as are circular baptisteries. Also on Crete, at Agioi Saranta, Demos of Víannos, the 13th EBA excavated within exposed ruins a cruciform font and six tombs, one being vaulted and frescoed and situated in the central aisle (occasionally the site of high-status burials in the Early Byzantine period). Most tombs contain Early Byzantine grave goods, for example perfume flasks, oinochoae and amphoriskoi. At Ladochori, Igoumenitsa, within an extensive Early Byzantine phase of settlement, a five aisled basilica paved with mosaics in geometric designs has been partially excavated by the 8th EBA. For the rural settlement, see below. 177. Livanates: religious donor's inscription in mosaic paving (Early Byzantine). © Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports: 24th EBA. A clearly important example of the new fortified complexes that are such a feature of the Early Byzantine countryside is being excavated by the 8th EBA at Opagia, Doliana, at the northeastern end of the Plain of Kalpaki. An octagonal tower has been identified (indicative of a high-status origin) (Fig. 178) and two Early Byzantine churches. Excavation of Basilica A revealed a three-aisled church with transepts and a narthex and two phases of mosaic floors dated to the late fifth to mid-sixth century, containing scenes of hunting, marine life, personifications of rivers and animal combats. Élite patronage may be assumed. This complex invites comparison with contem porary foundations in the Balkans and elsewhere in northern Greece. It is not clear whether this is the mosaic paved basilica at Kalpaki reported in Chronika in 1964 and 1968. #f- s i ■.■»&gt;&gt;•. "S. - fe - $h . — * -.*-&gt; ' *J r~ W»f£S r 178.

The significance of the villa in Early Byzantine Greece (élite rural residence, bailiff-managed estate or both) is a challenge similar in importance to, and overlapping in substance with, the challenge of sites such as Opagia. Several recently-reported excavations concern sites which can be interpreted as centres of estates or units of estates. At Maroulas, Demos of Rethymnon, Crete, the 28th EBA has excavated an agricultural villa with at least two phases (mid-third to sixth century). At Ladochori near Igoumenitsa within the Early Byzantine settlement the 8th EBA has excavated a residential complex focused upon a long mosaic-paved central hall with annexes (Fig. 179). This design and the discovery within it of architec tural sculpture indicate an élite residence of some kind. The discovery of much domestic pottery and glass could strengthen the case for it being an élite residence. The discovery of a terracotta mould of the Good Shepherd raises the possibility of its association with the church. In Aitoloakarnania on the north shore of the Gulf of Patras in the vicinity (implicitly) of ancient Makyneia, the 36,h EPCA excavated parts of a probable Roman villa, including its baths. The complex underwent much adaptation in Early Byzantine times, including intrusion of IfPL.. ■ 179.

At or around ancient Hephaisteia, Lemnos, the SAIA completed the excavation of the early seventh-century destruction layer of the Early Byzantine Residence with Columns (i.e., a peristyle residence) and distinguished two principal phases - a primary phase of the fifth century and a sixth-century one. At Kastelli near Gortyn the SAIA excavated a Roman rural villa at which occupation continued into Early Byzantine times. Many other rural establishments were reported in 2010-2011 at which the centre, or a centre, of an estate may be inferred, whatever the institutional origins or economic scale of the estate. At Polichni, Divari, Messenia, the 38th EPCA has uncovered a large Early Byzantine complex that recycled spolia from ancient monuments and which contains a large mosaic-paved hall. At Almyrida, Demos of Vamos, Crete, the 28th EBA has excavated part of a probable bath, built of brick (unusual in a provincial setting), of the sixth century. This might be an amenity of a private élite residence. At Kyani Akti, Aptera, Demos of Souda, the 35th EPCA has explored an Early Byzantine installation for the production and trans portation of wine (presumably the focus of an estate), situated on the shore and presumably close to the city of Aptera (which still functioned). At Dai'laki, Kastoria, the 16th EBA has explored a typial Early Byzantine bath-house (including an apsidal chamber), the wider setting of which remains unclear. Around Agrinio, Aitoloakarnania, the 36th EPCA has explored: (1) a Roman and Early Byzantine complex with stone walls, tiled roofs and tiled floors set in lime mortar, and evidence for the production of pottery, wine or olive oil, and for other 'workshops'; (2) walls of a probable agricultural installation associated with Early Byzantine (and older) sherds; (3) 'workshops' containing Early Byzantine sherds and glass. At Monastiriako Remma, Ambelaki, Petrina, in Arkadia, the 39th EPCA explored an agricultural complex containing a workshop. In Crete, at Chamalevri, Manouses, the 25th EBA has partially excavated the Early Byzantine phases of an agricultural installation that is Hellenistic in origin. In the Early Byzantine phase(s) of the fourth to fifth century, the earlier olive press was disused, but a potter's kiln (unexca vated) was perhaps in use. Amphorae (Cretan and imported) dominate the Early Byzantine ceramic assem blage, which includes imported finewares. Much of the complex remains unexcavated, including its baths. It suffered a sudden destruction in the fifth century. The 28th EBA excavated at Potamoi, Demos of Rethymnon, a small fourth-century bath complex, the broader setting of which is not characterized. At Moires, Demos of Moires, the 13th EBA partially excavated a bath-house, an associated pitheonas and residential rooms. The complex has two phases: a fifth- to early sixth-century phase and a sixth- to seventh-century one. Coins of Heraclius of the years AD 627-631 occur in phase II. A terracotta bread stamp with invocative inscription (Christian) was found. The 28th EBA excavated at Vryses in the Demos of Kryonerida an Early Byzantine agricultural establishment consisting of five rooms (a possible 'workshop' and four storerooms) of the sixth and first half of the seventh century. At Phounardos in the Demos of Kissamos the 25th EPCA excavated a possibly Early Byzantine agricul tural complex involved in the production of wine and olive oil, including two wine-presses. On the mainland, at Kainourgio in Aitoloakarnania the 36th EPCA excavated an Early Byzantine complex of workshops containing a wine-press and vat, and a storeroom for a large pithos. Pottery included, besides plain wares, sherds of fxnewares with scenes in relief and an inscribed lamp. The Archaeological Service has also investigated numerous traces of Early Byzantine rural communities - villages, low-status rural cemeteries, farmsteads, isolated low-status burials and, apparently isolated small-scale productive installations. Recent reports of rural basilicas, which are potentially highly relevant to the distribution of rural settlements, have already been summarized (above). At Ladochori, Igoumenitsa, already reported above for its high-status features, the Early Byzantine phase of an extensive settlement and cemetery was explored by the 8th EBA. At ancient Pallantion, Arkadia, the 39th EPCA reports much Early Byzantine pottery, reoccupation of a Hellenistic stoa and a potter's kiln constructed upon the line of the ancient defences. At E. Venizelos Avenue, Salamina, the 26th EPCA has excavated an Early Byzantine farmstead containing diagnostic pottery and remains of beehives. At Manari, Arkadia, the 39th EPCA identified, during construction of the Asea interchange of the Tripolis-Kalamata motorway, an intact Early Byzantine wine-press and vat. At Neo Phaliro, the 26th EPCA excavated an Early Byzantine potter's kiln built within a circular Classical or Hellenistic funerary monument at 7 Mitea Street. At Xiropigado, Tzavorema, near Nafpaktos, the 36th EPCA explored an Early Byzantine rural cemetery, almost without grave oods. In Moschato, between Athens and Piraeus, the 26th EPCA excavated 30 Early Byzantine graves outside the line of the Long Walls, all on the east-west axis (one being a built cist grave; two enchytrismov, the rest mostly simple cists) and datable to the fourth to fifth century. Complementing the rapidly developing record of excavation at Early Byzantine rural sites is evidence of dispersed loci of maritime traffic. New sites can be added to those previously reported. The villa complex on the north shore of the Gulf of Patras (Makyneia) mentioned above may well have had such a function. The well-known Early Byzantine maritime villa and production centre at Porto Cheli (south Argolid) is a good archaeological prototype. On the Bay of Agios Panteleimon, Astakos, Aitoloakarnania, the 8th EBA reports a dense and extensive array of buildings, probably Roman or Early Byzantine, including a probable apsidal church now extending into the sea. Around the site of Roman and Byzantine Nikopolis the 33rd EPCA notes the remains of three harbours. At Vathy it has excavated Roman and Early Byzantine phases, including a workshop for the production of purple dye. Implicitly, two such workshops were found by this harbour, one of which is implicitly Roman. Can an Early Byzantine phase of production be distinguished at either workshop? Dark Age Site by site, or district by district, a fourth- to early seventh-century range of Early Byzantine archaeological phenomena (such as those reported above) overlaps with a very different archaeology whose floruit is of roughly equal length (from the late sixth century into a ninth century period of transition) and which has sometimes, not without reason, been called the 'Dark Age'. The differ</page><page sequence="112">112 ARCHIE DUNN enees between the two ranges of phenomena, the apparent absences or discontinuities of 'Dark-Age' evidence and therefore the great reduction or cessation of recognizable activity at sites, mean that the few clearly relevant reports cannot in general be arranged under the headings used above to organize the Early Byzantine material. But the value of the six relevant reports to a range of discussions should be obvious. In the Andritsa Cave, Demos of Lerna, in the Argolid, the 2nd EBA and the EPSNE have excavated more than 40 skeletons (including those of children and babies), arranged in four clusters in close association with domestic pots, amphorae, wine jugs, lamps, metalwork and coins. Much of the pottery is identifiable as production of the northeast Peloponnese of the sxth to mid-seventh century. Coins are of the sixth century, ending with a gold solidus of Tiberius II (AD 578-582). At Loutro, Same, Kephallonia, the 20th EBA excavated a multi-phase Early Byzantine house in one part of which children were eventually being buried in pots (one being buried with a gold earring). Enchytrismoi already occur in the Early Byzantine period in cemeteries, but burial in the house suggests a relatively high degree of dislocation (at a date yet to be clarified). At Panormos, Demos of Gerospotamos, Crete, the 28th EBA has excavated a dwelling in which a partial destruction is associated with a coin of Phocas (AD 602-610) while other parts of the dwelling remained in use, as documented by diagnostic pottery (some implicitly imported) of the seventh to the first half of the eighth and by a coin of Constans II (issues of AD 659-664; implicitly of bronze). At Sparta the 5th EBA recorded in a reçue excavation 16 graves that belong to a cemetery, two of which were lined with brick and stone laid in a herringbone pattern, while another was lined with mortar. Grave goods, which are of the seventh century, include wine jugs, cups, iron knives, glass beads and silver earrings (reminiscent of burial customs at other locations in the former Prefecture of Illyricum). At Gortyn, Crete, the SAIA excavated in the Byzantine Quarter (between the Pythion and the Praetorium) a group of small roofed units built upon, and around three sides of, a Roman stone-paved yard, one of which contained skeletons of animals caught in the collapse of the complex, an event dated by coins to the AD 670s (a decade already associated with seismic destruction in the excavations of Gortyn). On the hill of Lykovouno, northeast of Daphne, near Sparta, in an area clearly settled in Early Byzantine times on the basis of sherds at the surface, the 5th EBA found a seventh- to eighth-century 'Corinthian' bronze belt buckle (a type named after its early recognition in the Corinth excavations). Middle to Late Byzantine While the Byzantine Ephoreias' responsibilities for the conservation and study of the art and architecture of the Byzantine and post-Byzantine churches of Greece remain very demanding, the recently reported range of excava tions, both research-led and rescue-led, at Byzantine sites of all kinds also offers potentially valuable contributions to Byzantine studies. An encouraging proportion of new reports of activity concern towns and kastra. At ancient Corinth the 25th EBA has excavated on the eastern side of the site at Kraneion the remains of a Middle Byzantine brick building, perhaps with public functions, whose associated architectural members, pottery and coins indicate that it still functioned in the 14th century. Elsewhere, plain wares and finewares of the 11th and late 12th to early 13th centuries contribute to the argument that Kraneion was a significant neighbourhood in the medieval era. At Sparta the 5lh EBA has continued to excavate around Alkman Street a very well-preserved Byzantine olive press in proximity to which a Middle Byzantine house and baths have been found. The house had at least four rooms with fine plaster floors and columns. The medieval Byzantine finds include two lead sealings. At Nafplion the 25th EBA excavated a small extramural kiln associated with Late Byzantine pottery. At the fortification of Agios Georgios tis Kolokythias, Karavas, Attica, excavations by the 1st EBA have revealed secular and religious buildings within an enceinte of horseshoe-shaped towers. The principal preserved occupation phase seems to be Late Byzantine (i.e. Franco-Byzantine in Attica), but an earlier foundation is proposed. At Ioannina, in the course of excavations designed to clarify the whole sequence of urban fortifica tions, the 8th EBA identified the foundations of the Late Byzantine enceinte (13th—14th century) and, within the walls, coins and pottery of the 11th- 14th century. At the kastro of Agios Georgios, Kolokythia, Kythera, the 1th EBA's excavations established major Middle Byzantine and Late Byzantine construction phases. At Nafpaktos, on Plastira Street, the 22th EBA has excavated parts of a complete 'Byzantine' (implicitly Middle and Late Byzantine) bath complex (Fig. 180) and cistern associated with much glazed pottery. At Magazia, Kastoria, the 16th EBA has extended older excavations of a small implicitly Middle to Late Byzantine monastery. On the islet of Sokastro by ancient and Early Byzantine Leukos, Karpathos, the Canadian School and the 4lh EBA have surveyed a castle which contains three vaulted cisterns, other simpler cisterns situated among numerous two- or three-roomed buildings and three churches (one basilical), associated with pottery of the 1 Ith—16th century, most sherds being of the 12th—13th century. The primary and most important phase is deemed to be that of the 11th—13th century. This complex, given also its location, is poten tially immensely instructive. In Arta the 11th EPCA excavated another part of a cemetery presumed to be linked with the Parigoritissa church and monastery. Forty 180.

On the northwest slopes of the citadel of Nafpaktos the 22nd EBA excavated another part of one of the principal 'Byzantine' cemeteries of the town, low status in character. There is evidence of unworked stone grave-markers set into mortar. Churches in towns and kastra were also the subject of excavations. Beneath the Post-Byzantine church of the Pantanassa, Monastiraki Square, Athens (Fig. 181), the 1st EBA discovered a Middle Byzantine church with two phases associated with graves containing numerous deposited objects. At Amphissa (Middle and Late Byzantine Salona) the 1st EBA reports that the Early Byzantine basilica found in 2001-2002 has later phases associated with burials. Beside (implicitly within) the maritime wall of Thessaloniki a three-aisled basilica has been found which has graves within and around it of the seventh to eighth century. This church was destroyed at the time of the Saracen attack (AD 904 ), against which the maritime wall was further strengthened. The destroyed church continued to be a burial ground. At Nafpaktos the 22nd EBA has excavated a three-aisled Middle Byzantine basilica paved with marble and equipped with a marble templon. Within ancient Photike in Epeiros the 8th EBA has excavated a three-aisled Middle Byzantine basilica that overlies an Early Byzantine one and recycles much of its architectural sculpture (Fig. 182). At the location Valsamari within this site, another three-aisled basilica, with a medieval tripartite sanctuary and later phases, has been identified. At Christianoi (medieval Byzantine Christianoupolis), Messenia, the 26th EBA opened ten trenches around the restored Middle Byzantine episcopal church and episcopal residence. Several graves were found within the church that contained grave goods. At Leontari in Messenia the Director of the 25th EBA, D. Athanassoulis, explored three churches within the medieval Byzantine citadel. Agia Kyriaki (Fig. 183) has three semicircular apses, a built bench around the nave and an underground vaulted chamber (presumably a crypt) accessible from the south. On the north side an annexe as wide as the church was added, equipped on three sides with built benches and with three subterranean ossuaries. A narthex and exonarthex have also been identified. Within the inner citadel a large cistern and other important medieval struc tures have been identified. Several recent reports concern the Middle or Late Byzantine churches of recognized or possible monasteries and cemeteries in the countryside (or erstwhile countryside). At Ktio, Diporo, in the upper Haliakmon valley, Prefecture of Grevena, the University of Thessaloniki continued excavating the Middle Byzantine phase of a multi-period cemetery. This phase is rich in grave goods such as fired pots, iron knives, iron arrow heads, jewellery, dress ornaments and coins of the ninth century. This spectrum of grave goods (less the coins) is not uncommon from the end of the sixth century. Northeast of Daphne (southeast of Sparta) the 5th EBA reports on the study of excavations conducted in 1996 at the monastic complex of St George on the hill of Lykovouno. The wider hill-top settlement both pre-dates and post-dates the monastic church, of whose first phase of decoration an 1 llll-12th-century opus sectile floor and a 12th-century templon are preserved.

At Metamorphosi (formerly Skarmingas) in Messenia the 26th EBA, excavating beneath the modern floor of the church of the Metamorphosis of the Saviour, found a cist grave and several crudely built tombs lacking grave goods within a deposit rich in glazed pottery, bronze coins (12th-century) and fragments of glass vessels. At Agios Konstantinos, Demetra, by the Haliakmon, in the Prefecture of Grevena, the University of Thessaloniki has excavated a three-aisled basilica with three phases associated, by the 12th century, with a cemetery. A sequence of chapels succeeds the basilica in the 12th—13th century. At the church of Agios Andreas, Livadi, Kythera, the 1st EBA has revealed a ninth to tenth-century phase of architecture in a Middle Byzantine church. Agios Andreas is already known for three phases of Middle and Late Byzantine frescos. At Plataniti in the Argolid the 25lh EBA has revealed parts of an extensive cemetery of the late 13th to early 15th century around the ^""-century cruciform church of the Metamorphosis of the Saviour. On the Prophitis Elias hill, at Kechropoula in Aitoloakarnania, the 8th EBA has explored a single-aisled 'Byzantine' church (implicitly medieval Byzantine) constructed of spolia from an adjacent Archaic to Classical temple. Could the association of Byzantine pithoi signify the presence of a small monastic community? At the village of Alikianos (west of Chania) the 28th EBA has excavated some 80 tombs of the 11 "'-12th century onwards, some containing grave goods, around the church of Zoódochos Pigi. Also in Crete at Argyroupoli in the Demos of Lappa, the 28th EBA, excavating within the church of Agia Kyriaki, has revealed that its lateral walls re-use the caldarium of an Early Byzantine bath-house. There are parallels for this phenomenon. Within and around the church are 12th-century cist graves. Meanwhile, rescue excavations around the village confirm the existence of a medieval Byzantine settlement. At Armenoi in the Demos of Armenoi the same Ephoreia has identified a 12th-13th-century domed building underneath a Post-Byzantine church.

Byzantine, not (as was thought by some scholars) Early Byzantine in origin. Middle Byzantine and Frankish phases have been distinguished in the excavations of the monastic cells. In the district of Paiania, Attica, the 1st EBA recorded an extensive medieval Byzantine and post Byzantine cemetery. At Agioi Theodoroi, Kiphissia, a probable funerary church in use from ca. AD 900 onwards, associated with re-used and superimposed graves, some of which contained jewellery and pottery, has been explored too. At Maroussi, Attica, part of a Late Byzantine chapel (probably single-aisled) surrounded by graves has been excavated. The medieval Byzantine (including 'Franco Byzantine') agricultural landscape of Attica, so much of it now within Greater Athens, has also been the subject of numerous rescue-led excavations, which, however briefly reported so far, could, it is to be hoped, presage a new phase in the archaeology of the Byzantine countryside. In the district of Gerakas the 1st EBA recorded an extensive storage complex of 12 lined silos and 16 pithoi which, on the basis of associated objects, is Middle Byzantine. In the district of Agios Ioannis Rentis, at Odos Peiraios 254, the 1st EBA explored a site datable to the 11th— 15th century containing two wine-presses and storage vats of lime</page><page sequence="115">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2011-2012 115 mortar-bonded undressed stone masonry (Fig. 184). By the Anotati Scholi Kalon Technon, the 1st EBA recorded a Middle to Late Byzantine wine-press. On Kiphissou Avenue the 1st EBA recorded walls, silos and pithoi belonging to an extensive agricultural complex of 'the Byzantine to Late Byzantine period' (Fig. 185). At Ano Glyphada the 26th EPCA explored a complex of rooms of varying width but almost all ca. 3m long, arranged around all four sides of a 43m2 yard and associated with Middle Byzantine pottery. There is evidence of an outer yard with a protected entrance and the foundations of a substantial structure 2 x 2.5m at its base (called a 'tower' but perhaps a kind of storeroom). On Pentelis Avenue part of a Late Byzantine to post-Byzantine storage complex was reported (Fig. 186). In the district of Gerani an extensive agricultural storage complex of the 13th—14th century is also reported. Finally, at Drosia, Kiphissia, two wine presses, pithoi and associated buildings of the 'Byzantine' era have been reported (Fig. 187). 187.
