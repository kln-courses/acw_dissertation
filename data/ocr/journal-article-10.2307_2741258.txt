<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent Publications as of 15 XI 76 [Publications received, of anthropological interest, will be listed for reference purposes and to draw them to the attention of the interna- tional community. Listings will include the anthropological contents of periodicals and symposia and such descriptions as are necessary to convey the nature of the publication. Some titles in languages other than English will be translated and will appear in brackets. For serials, publication addresses and subscription information will be mentioned in the first listing, and thereafter once a year, in the March issue. List- ing does not preclude subsequent review by CA treatment, although this will be rare. CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY does not normally publish standard reviews, but the Editor welcomes and will consider pub- lishing correspondence or articles containing evaluative criticisms.- EDITOR.] SERIALS Das Altertum.
