<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Body Electric GE, TV, and the Reagan Brand Tim Raphael There's no business like show business. ?Irving Berlin (1946) Ronald Reagan first appeared at the 1984 Republican National Convention on a screen above a stage. From that stage, astride a podium flanked by two American flags, Nancy Reagan raised her eyes to greet the image that dwarfed her. As she turned her notorious gaze upon his celebrated images she extended both her arms upward towards the screen. Rising to their feet Tim Raphael is a theatre director and performance historian, who, as a director, producer, drama turge, and adapter, has developed over 40 new American plays. He has taught theatre and performance studies at Wesleyan University, Dartmouth College, Northwestern University, Ursinus College, Rutgers Newark, and the Universidade Aberta in Lisbon, Portugal. He currently teaches at Georgetown University. Recent publications include an experiment in performative writing, published in Oxford Magazine, and an article in a special issue ^/Transformations documenting his work with students at Rutgers-Newark on a multimedia performance piece devised from recent immigrant narratives. Previous articles on Ronald Reagan have appeared in TDR and Theatre Journal. His book Ronald Reagan: The President Electric is at press with the University of Michigan Press.

Trimmed in the colors of the flag, the convention hall reverberated with their adoration. The rest of us watched him, smiling and waving, on television. We watched as the crowd waved back, while he, "diffused to infinity," disappeared into "an infinitely fragmenting video relay" (Massumi and Dean 1994:158). We watched our televisions as the cameras watched the conventioneers watch Nancy watch the screen, and it was easy to conclude that Ronald Reagan had indeed become, in Michael Rogin's apt phrase, "the image that has fixed our gaze" (1987:3). But why were we watching this man? What were the qualities he possessed that enabled him to fix our gaze and define our viewing habits? And why did we keep watching as he became?in the infinitude of his representation? an image without a body, a projection on a screen? The theatrical line-of-business from which Reagan's image derives its lineage is that of the somnipractor?Garry Wills's term for all the product salesmen who serve as "the arrangers of other's dreams" (1988:126). Reagan's re-nomination was a foregone conclusion. His image on the giant video screen was a trailer for the 18-minute film homage to Reagan's first term that premiered later at the convention, which was itself a preview for an expanded 30-minute "documentary" version broadcast by all three networks. Then there were the "Morning Again in America" and "America is Back" campaign commercials that began airing shortly thereafter. The cumulative effect evoked Guy Debord's insight that the image had become the final form of commodity reification ([1970] 1995). The convention itself functioned more as a trade show than a coronation. Reagan's performance was a product launch designed to dazzle the gathered delegates and the consumers watching on TV with the new media campaign for the revamped product line that would be marketed through the Reagan brand. The Reagan presidency was coterminous with a new theory of corporate management that held that the primary focus of an increasingly postindustrial capitalism was no longer the production of material goods but images of their brands. Journalist Naomi Klein (2002) identifies Reagan's final year in office as the defining moment in this shift in the core business of corporations, when Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.6 billion?six times Kraft's paper value. The premium Philip Morris paid to acquire Kraft's brand was not a function of its use value; it was the cost of the word "Kraft." For tobacco-tainted Philip Morris the symbolic value of Kraft's brand image, it appeared, had a significantly higher value than all of Kraft's fungible assets put together. The disparity between Kraft's net worth and the price it fetched at market, like the disparity between popular support for Reagan and his policies, was a function of the mimetic value of the brand?an assessment predicated on the magical capacity of what Walter Benjamin termed "the controllable and transferable image" to increase the commercial worth of any product to which it was attached (1968:247). Addressing the U.S. Association of National Advertisers that same year, the chairman of the global advertising firm of Ogilvy &amp; Mather preached the new gospel: competing in a commodity marketplace "solely on price, promotion, and trade deals, all of which can easily be duplicated by competition" was a sucker's game (in Klein 2002:7-8). The most effective means of increasing corporate value was branding. In the new calculus of the society of the spectacle, brand promotion was no longer simply a sales strategy but an equity investment. Images of brands were ubiquitous in the 1980s. Brand logos emerged from the inside of clothing to advertise the wearer's status and the company's image. Corporate sponsorship branded the built environment from cityscapes to sports stadiums, cultural venues to schools. In the music industry, concert tours were opportunities for what the somnipractors termed "live-action advertising," and MTV became the paradigm for fully branded media integration. In the movie business, product placement in films was the tip of the iceberg in an industry that increasingly conceptualized the films themselves as branded media properties. Disney, Figure I. (previous page) "The President Electric. " Ronald Reagan kicks off the branding campaign at the 1984 Republican Convention. (?Bettman/Corbis)</page><page sequence="3">the original mega-brand, launched the first brand superstore, branded holidays, and built the ultimate in brand penetration, Celebration, Florida, the first branded town. In sports Michael Jordan established himself as the first celebrity brand.1 And in politics there was Ronald Reagan. By the time he became president there were only a handful of people whose image had circu lated for as long as or as widely through the communications media, and the Reagan brand was an unparalleled political asset. In the new branded marketplace of the 1980s, Ronald Reagan was the wfor-brand. The Body Electric The efficacy of political branding in the United States during the 1980s resulted from the systematic application of the techne?the techniques and technologies?of electronic media to time-tested practices linking performance forms and players to political movements and audiences. Politics in the United States has always been a performance art. The first nation to be conceived without historical precedent or pre-existing script, from the outset the task of creating a new nation was intertwined with the process of expressing a persuasive rationale for its existence. As a consequence, the founding documents and rituals of the United States express a shared perception of the unprecedented task of performatively enacting a legitimate and authoritative basis for revolution. Once independence was achieved it was generally understood that in a nation without a king new modes of political authority would need to be constituted for governance. From the beginning the figures who would thrive on the American political stage believed that their status as social actors was inextricably linked to the techne of the theatrical stage, and that proficiency in the elocutionary arts constituted their political capital. Despite a residual antitheatrical prejudice inherited from their Puritan ancestors, American Patriots understood their task in theatrical terms, and emphasized the arts of political rhetoric, oratory, and stagecraft as much as those of political science, philosophy, and statecraft. The Utopian social and theological promise of "America" was, in fact, often depicted by Republicans through the trope of the nation as a stage, "designed by Providence," as John Adams theatrically proclaimed, "on which Man was to make his true figure" ([1765] 1964:282). The theatre to which Adams referred is of course history and not a "real" theatre. Yet the "true figure," the figure given America and its people, was understood by the founders to signify both a historical destiny and a contingent identity. The new national subject was conceived as a role, one that needed to be individually and collectively enacted in order for the national mission to be realized. A century later, determined to restore the nation to its divinely ordained destiny as an Anglo Saxon republic, John Wilkes Booth, in his melodramatic staging of Abraham Lincoln's assassina tion from the balcony of Ford's Theater, embodied a related understanding of the indissoluble link between the cultural and the political actor. Booth's action reflected a widespread belief? shared by Lincoln and other avid theatregoers of the 19th century?that the stage was an im portant forum for negotiating the identity of America and Americans. Reagan's image on the screen above a stage, like his career prior to politics, reflects the transition from the stage to the screen as the dominant venue for mediating national identity in the 20th century. It also evokes the genealogy of the body electric. "I sing the body electric," Walt Whitman rhapsodized in Leaves of Grass, extolling the capacity of the human body to electrify others, to "charge them full with the charge of the soul" ([1855] 1900:81). The charge Whitman envisioned owed something to the antebellum fascina tion with electricity and something else entirely to what his biographer David S. Reynolds called "the carnivalized culture of antebellum America" (1996:156). In Whitman's America, political orators, religious evangelists, poets, and musicians shared the same stage, and audiences 1. These examples are culled from Naomi Klein's exegesis in No Logo of the pervasiveness of branding during the 1980s (2002:1-14). o CO ^ eo crq so S3 W i-?

Whitman's poetry and body politic were charged by the occult forces of electric ity, but the current that animated the body electric was that of the performer. Whitman himself was a performer by sensibility as well as by occupation. His friend William Roscoe Thayer described him in admiring terms as "a poseur of truly colossal proportions, one to whom playing a part had long before become so habitual that he ceased to be conscious he was doing it" (in Reynolds 1996:161). Whitman's unconscious performances derived from the seemingly limitless repertoire of roles drawn from the wide range of cultural performances that constituted an integral part of daily life in antebellum America. In carrying out his mission to poetically reconstruct the United States, Whitman borrowed heavily from the eclectic array of performances he covered for The Brooklyn Eagle to craft the multitudes of personae he assumed in his songs of self and nation. For Whitman the very promise of democratic sovereignty was derived from a vision of democracy that valued the theatrical presentation of the self as the definitive measure of both individual representation and national distinction. In the 20th century, though, something happened to the charge between bodies as they circulated through the electrified performance circuits that hard-wired culture and capital to democracy. The movie Fame, released in 1980, the year Reagan was elected to his first term as president, depicts the education of aspiring actors, dancers, singers, and comedians at New York City's High School of Performing Arts, from their entry auditions to their final year. At the end of the movie, their education completed, the students perform the graduation number. What the acolytes have learned?and the difference between Whitman's and Reagan's culture of performance?is summarized by the students' new understanding of the charge of bodies: I sing the body electric I glory in the glow of rebirth Creating my own tomorrow When I shall embody the earth We are the emperors now And we are the czars And in time And in time We will all be stars (Pitchford and Gore 1980) Ronald Reagan was a devotee of the same electronically mass-mediated performance circuit that attracted Fame's students to stardom and that redefined the performer as a body electric. Dur ing Reagan's presidency the body politic was similarly reconfigured as a collective body electric; a body charged by electronic media. Spanning the realms of star and czar, Reagan's career traces the arc from Whitman's characterization of Abraham Lincoln ("When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd"; 1865) as the "great star" who "early droop'd in the western sky" to Earned promise of stardom for all. As exemplified by Reagan, this new body electric?celebrated by the stars oiFame and embodied by Reagan at the convention?generates a new relationship between the body of the performer and the body politic, an electrically stimulated connection charged with the branding power of electronic media. Brand Loyalty Beginning with the Nixon administration, image-crafting, always a critical component of political campaigning, assumed an unprecedented importance in the art of government itself. The decay of electoral allegiances and alliances in place since the New Deal, the decline of party machines, and round-the-clock scrutiny by the mass media significantly altered the architecture and dimensions of the political stage. The advent of what journalist Sidney Blumenthal termed "the permanent campaign" (1982) placed a new premium on an administration's ability to utilize</page><page sequence="5">the media in the marketing and public relations campaigns that increasingly determined its ability to influence public opinion, market its policies, and enact its political agenda. While presidents since Franklin Roosevelt had used radio as a bully pulpit, and since Eisenhower had sought to maximize their television exposure, Nixon's creation of the White House Office of Communications?staffed by PR, advertising, and media professionals?institutionalized television as a principle technology for governance. "Going public" became the popular euphemism for circumventing the checks-and-balances of congressional oversight by using television to rally public opinion in support of political initiatives (Kernell 1986). The strategic use of television in going public was similar to FDR's use of radio to generate public support, not so much for the policies themselves but for the president who promoted them. Ray Price, Nixon's chief speechwriter and the mentor of Reagan's communication director David Gergen, summarized the strategy as: "Get the voters to like the guy and the battle's two-thirds won" (in Hertsgaard 1988:15). But as Price made clear it was not really "the guy" the public needed to like, but his image: "The response is to the image, not to the man... It's not the man we have to change, but rather the received impression" (15). In going public one of the most critical functions of statecraft becomes what might be termed the mediation of the nation?the management of a body politic constructed from the competing figural and narrative representations of the electrified bodies that circulate through the networks of the communications matrix. In the new mass-mediated public sphere the primary task of government was now to effectively channel those networks?to master the matrix. In the political economy of the matrix the somnipractor assumes the role of empire builder. This new class of power brokers serves as political acting coaches, stage managers of presidential productions, and producers of political administrations. In an era in which politics increasingly focused on gauging how specific appeals would "play" on the mass-mediated stage, and follow ing the spin attracted more attention than policy debates, somnipractors like Lee Atwater, Roger Ailes, and Michael Deaver achieved their own niche celebrity among the cognoscenti. The role of these political dream merchants was similar to what theatre director Harold Clur man described as the task of teaching actors a theatrical language. "It was the leader's task," Clurman wrote of his pedagogical method, "to fashion a common language and common point of reference with those whom he hoped to lead" (in Nelson 1996:113). In Reagan a new breed of political star-maker had a political actor already conversant in a "common language," one he had acquired from and performed in virtually every venue of electronic media, and a "common form of reference"?the mass-mediated celebrity. It was the somnipractors who understood?better than any one else in the Reagan administration?that one of the most important assets Reagan acquired during his years with General Electric was the capacity to use television to promote a wide variety of products through the magical properties of a fully dramatized brand image. One measure of the power of the Reagan brand was his administration's ability to deploy it to generate consent for Reagan's presidency in lieu of a popular mandate for his policies. The remarkable disparity in polling figures between public approval for Reagan (for large stretches of his presidency in the range of 60 to 70 percent) and approval of his policies (rarely higher than the low 40th percentile) has been downplayed by political scientists. Thomas Ferguson and Joel Rogers argue that: significant differentials between performance and personal approval ratings of Presidents are utterly routine, that they always show greater personal approval than performance approval (since Americans, for whatever reason, want to believe that their Presidents are nice guys), and that in fact the differential Reagan enjoyed was proportionately smaller than those of most of his predecessors, not larger. (1986:24-5) This analysis, however, misses the point by focusing on the statistics as mathematical numbers rather than cultural signs. o w CO S3 D 5* ^ ft&gt; co OQ CO S3 w CO S3 117</page><page sequence="6">03 a. 03 3 P 118 What was significant about the disparity between public support for Reagan and his policies was that Reagan's communications apparatus was so adept at constructing and deploying his image in the media, and media professionals so unwilling or unable to counter the spin, that a majority of Americans believed the disparity to be significant. In Reagan's case, the discrepancy between public approval for his person and for his policies did reflect an unprecedented phe nomenon: rather than undermining the Reagan administration's political agenda, the much publicized gap between Reagan's personal popularity and public support for his policies actually increased Reagan's political capital. Dubbed the "Teflon President," Reagan was not held accountable for unpopular policies, was impervious to scandal, and, until Bitburg and Iran Contra, was beyond blame for mismanaged political events.2 The public support for Reagan? in spite of opposition to his political agenda?was promoted by his administration as a sign of his popular mandate. Reagan's popularity, however, was not the result of the spontaneous outpouring of affection his handlers touted in the media. In fact, it was as relentlessly choreographed as his ribbon cutting ceremonies and cowboy photo shoots. The Reagan administration's methods for generating consent where no consensus existed was exemplified by a performative techne its producers termed "the line of the day." At 8:15 most mornings during Reagan's first term, White House Chief of Staff James Baker would convene a meeting. At the meeting (regularly attended by communications advisor David Gergen, Deputy Press Secretary Larry Speakes, presidential advisor Richard Darman, and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver) the discussion revolved around how to "enhance the image of the President," as one participant phrased it. The primary question addressed in these meetings was, "What do we want the press to cover today and how?" (Hertsgaard 1988:35). When consensus was reached and the line of the day crafted, memos were dispatched to every office of government with instructions to feature the line in all interviews with the media and at every event for which there would be media coverage. The line of the day served as a kind of caption for the images of Reagan produced during the day by Deaver and broadcast at night on the network news. According to Donald Regan, Secretary of the Treasury and subsequently Deaver's successor as Chief of Staff, Deaver "designed each presidential action as a one-minute or two-minute spot on the evening news" and "conceived every presidential appearance in terms of camera angles." In Regan's estimation, Deaver cast Reagan "as a sort of supreme anchorman whose public persona was the most important element of his presidency" (Regan 1988:248). Like Nightlines Ted Koppel, Reagan performed the role of the mediator of crises. But as the supreme anchorman the crisis Reagan repeatedly mediated was one of national destiny; a crisis of representation for which Deaver and Reagan provided images capable of lending narrative coherence and affective resonance to the day's events. Deaver crafted the image and the image toed the line. As Press Secretary for the Reagan Bush '84 campaign James Lake put it, Reagan was "the ultimate presidential commodity, the right product" (in Hertsgaard 1988:48). But if Reagan was the ultimate presidential product, he was also an ideal celebrity salesman. For Lyn Nofziger, a former newspaper reporter and editor, and a public relations and political consultant to Reagan since his gubernatorial days, Reagan was "the best candidate. I'm not talking about ability to govern, but the best candidate from the standpoint of understanding instinctively what you have to do to get favorable coverage for the kind of media we have today" (in Hertsgaard 1988:48). The quality that Nofziger credits as instinct was more accurately identified by an unnamed former White House aide as "training": He's an actor. He's used to being directed and produced. He stands where he is supposed to and delivers his lines, he reads beautifully, he knows how to wait for the applause line. You know how some guys are good salesmen but can't ask the customer to give them the order? This guy is good at asking for the order, and getting it. (in Hertsgaard 1988:46) 2. It was Colorado Congresswomen Patricia Schroeder who coined the phrase the "Teflon presidency."</page><page sequence="7">If, as Rogin suggests, "the idol of consumption is the salesman or the object he sells" (1987:8), then surely Reagan qualifies on both counts?his career and his presidency testify to his capacity to play either role. Like Reagan's appearance at the convention and the media campaign it launched, the line of the day reflected the ubiquity of the electronic performance circuit and the affective potency of the body electric. During his presidency, performances featuring Reagan's image saturated the airwaves in 15-second sound bites, 30-second and minute-long campaign commercials, 30-minute promo reels, and hour-long news "documentaries." Spin the dial and there he was on CNN and the network news, performing roles in old movies or plugging the new James Bond film, as guest commentator at sporting events or emceeing all-star galas and celebrity roasts. In its fecund transmission Reagan's pervasive image accreted into a performative vision of a nation defined by an ongoing process of reinvention, renewal, and rebirth. As these moving images of Reagan as-America circulated through the mass communications networks that delivered them to us, their autonomy as images eroded, congealing into one continuous serial broadcast, "America in the Age of Reagan." As in other long-running serialized television melodramas of the period (I am thinking especially of Dallas and Dynasty), the Reagan narrative carried these promises: That Americans' image of both nation and self was, at the root, an aesthetic one, a matter of "lifestyle"; that seemingly intractable social and economic problems could be addressed by stimulating desires that could only be achieved through unbridled consumption; that a govern ment dedicated to promoting access to greater goods rather than the greater good could manufacture consent where no consensus existed; that with compelling enough story lines, the right casting, and creative cross-marketing anything was possible. Spurning the New Deal verities of market discipline and governmental regulation of business, the performance of the Reagan melodrama promulgated a "free market" revolution dedicated to the proposition that in politics, as in other commodity-based markets, consumers' purchasing decisions would no longer be limited by the efficacy of the product (Reagan's policies) but stimulated by a desire for the brand (Reagan's image). Building the Brand Reagan's education in branding began with his arrival in Hollywood, but the political brand began to take shape in 1954, with the coming together of three pioneers of the branded nation ?Ronald Reagan, General Electric, and television. Their point of convergence was a television show, The General Electric Television Theater (GE TV Theater), broadcast on CBS (the network of the Central Broadcasting Corporation) from 1954 to 1962. The program was an exemplary product of what Lizabeth Cohen has recently defined as "the Consumers' Republic," the post World War II political economy and political culture in which the tasks of reconstructing the national economy and reaffirming democratic values were linked by the shared imperative to promote the expansion of mass consumption (2003). GE TV Theater promoted a new democratic ideal?the republic of consumption?featuring the citizen-consumer as the protagonist of a heroic drama cosponsored by democracy and capital. Reagan's television celebrity and rise to political prominence were themselves products of this new vision of the imagined community of the nation powered by the body electric in the empire of commodities. Although it became de rigueur while he was president to diminish Reagan's film career, after appearing as Drake McHugh in Kings Row in 1942, at least the salary he commanded was that of a movie star.3 Before he could make another picture, however, the United States entered World War II and Reagan's career took a different turn. By 1954, at the age of 43, after 17 years in Hollywood, his film career was effectively over. A series of postwar box office flops, his divorce from his first wife, Jane Wyman, the decline of the studio system in the wake of the Supreme 3. In 1946, Reagan's salary was $169,750, ranking him 10th among Hollywood actors, just behind Rosalind Russell and ahead of Rita Hayworth (see Powdermaker 1950:209). o w CO S3 Q 3 fc &amp; CO Oq co S3 w co S3 D 119</page><page sequence="8">"a3 03 Oh 03 P 120 _____________________________________________________________v ma^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^h^^^^^^^^h^_f ___R__?_p$$G^__ii_^i ^^^^^^ n___________ ________________________________________________T :^B^^^^^wP|^^^^^^S^|^^^^^f^^^^^^^^B^ J^^^^^^H ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^HLj^^^^^'^^r" -: ^^^^&amp;?f^^l__p% ________________ ______________________________H________H ' ________________ l^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B mmmmmf &gt;x-^ff^r'fPlfctok ^^^ *?&gt;?, ' ^_||___i __________________ ^^^^^^^^^^^'^ ' &lt; % t%&lt;i' J3^^^^m Mmmmmmmmmmmm WmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmWmmmmmmMmj^^ * WiW -?H^^JI&gt; ^11rHl^Mf&lt;; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H Figure 2. "Building the Brand. " While meeting with some of his earliest congressional backers in Washington, Reagan autographs his Van Heusen advertisement that appeared in the December 1953 issue 0/Tife Magazine. (?Bettman/Corbis) Court decision in U.S. v. Paramount in 1948, and his controversial tenure as president of the Screen Actors Guild had all contributed to derailing his once-promising film career. By the early 1950s Reagan's income from film had dwindled to the point that he began appearing in cameo roles on television, considered at the time to be the sign of a career in decline for established movie actors. Early 1954 marked the nadir of his acting career, when he accepted a two-week gig in Las Vegas in a variety act at what must have seemed to the struggling actor to be the prophetically named Last Frontier Hotel. It was then, Reagan recalls, that "this television show came riding along. The Cavalry to the rescue" (in Moldea 1986:99-100). The cavalry appeared in the person of Taft Schreiber, Vice President of Reagan's talent agency, MCA, and the head of its television production company, Revue Productions. Reagan's rescue took the form of a lucrative offer to serve as the "program supervisor," host, and occasional actor for General Electric Television Theater, an established but under-performing anthology series on CBS.4 The initial lure of television for Reagan was strictly financial. Just a few months before GE came calling, in an article in Variety, Reagan had expressed his negative opinion of television? one shared by most film actors of the day. In the interview, Reagan responded to the critics who had characterized his Vegas engagement as the last gasp of a fading film star: Our business [is] the most ruthlessly competitive there is [...] A producer can be denied financial backing for one failure, an actor can go from [a] $100,000 price tag to unemploy 4. Reagan's initial contract paid him $125,000 a year. In 1959, MCA began paying him directly. By eliminating his agents fee he received a 10 percent raise. MCA also negotiated a 25 percent stake for Reagan in the shows future proceeds, including reruns.</page><page sequence="9">ment on the supposition that a picture's failure was due to his lack of box office appeal. No one questions whether he can act. In fact, everyone will admit he is a superb actor [...] but, because Joe Shmoe, the moviegoer sat up with a sick friend [...] instead of seeing our hero at the bijou, he faces starvation or a job on television, (in Edwards 1987:446) In his memoirs Reagan claims to have turned down many previous offers to star in television series, and lists three reasons why he was wary of the medium. Expressing a concern common among members of the film industry in the early days of television, Reagan feared playing a recurring character on a TV series "could be the professional kiss of death to a movie actor: The people who owned movie theaters thought nobody would buy a ticket to see someone they could see in their living room for nothing." A second risk, one Reagan had fought to avoid throughout his movie career, was typecasting. Echoing another commonly held view, Reagan contended that after starring in a TV series, "Audiences?and producers?tended to think of you only as the character you'd played on television." The third reason Reagan gives for his reluctance to cast his lot with television was "that having my face beamed into homes across the country every week risked the kind of overexposure that could be fatal to a movie actor's career" (Reagan 1990:125-26). In retrospect there is more than a little irony in Reagan's anxiety about the potential impact of television on his movie career. In fact, it is precisely the reasons Reagan cites for his trepida tion?viewers free access to television, maximum exposure to a mass audience, and the creation of an enduring and familiar persona?that constituted the basis for the celebrity he would acquire on GE TV Theater and his viability a decade later as a political candidate. Reagan's concern with being typecast as a result of appearing on television also seems disingenuous in light of a film career that was a model for the way the studio system exploited typecasting in rationalizing production and marketing its products. Reagan had long expressed frustration with Warner Brothers' unwillingness to cast him as a Western hero. With few exceptions his film roles had consistently placed him within an industry niche exemplified by his self-professed nickname of "Mr. Norm," a genial, Midwestern, corn-fed handsome, American everyman. In this regard GE TV Theater was an ideal vehicle for his not insubstantial but limited skills as a performer. The show was sponsored by General Electric, but it was owned by the Music Corporation of America (MCA), run by Reagan's longtime agent, Lew Wasserman. In order to take advan tage of their waiver and collect their 10 percent commission from Reagan and the other actors they represented who appeared on the show, MCA installed the advertising agency BBD&amp;O as producers. The arrangement would prove to be mutually beneficial to all the parties involved. While Reagan would have been loathe to acknowledge it at the time, television's smaller screen and his role as host provided the ideal scale and conditions to feature Reagan's strengths as a performer while minimizing his deficiencies as an actor. In return GE got exactly what they were looking for from Reagan?a popular embodiment of their corporate image. In retrospect this union of Ronald Reagan, General Electric, and television marks a pivotal moment in the relationship between corporate capitalism, popular culture, and electronic media. The Corporate Soul Corporations have neither bodies to be punished nor souls to be condemned. They therefore do as they like. ?Edward Thurlow (in Poynder 1844:248) From its inception the cultivation of a positive public image had been of paramount concern to General Electric, as critical to the corporation's growth as its research labs, home of the alchemical processes by which advances in physics and chemistry were transformed into capital accumulation through commodification. At its inception at the end of the 19th century GE was not alone in perceiving the production of its corporate image to be another form of alchemy? o so a rt &amp;r so aq W to D 121</page><page sequence="10">CO Oh B P 122 one that required altering the "natural" properties of the corporation. One of the most signifi cant structural components undergirding the rise of corporate capitalism was the new legal status corporations acquired in a header to the 1886 Supreme Court decision in Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, the ruling in which the precedent for the doctrine of "corpo rate personhood" was first established. Henceforth, corporations would be treated as "persons" under the 14th Amendment; a legal entity endowed with all the rights of the individual but with none of the legal responsibilities of human beings. While their anthropomorphic ontology gave corporations a distinct competitive advantage over other organizations of capital, it also constituted a lurking threat to the corporation's capacity to reproduce its assets: its products, labor force, markets, and the personification of its public image. What Mark McGurl describes as "the anxiety of embodiment" (1996:417) derives from the paradox at the heart of corporate representation: commerce demands visibility, yet that very visibility threatens to reveal the fictitious basis of corporate power, exposing the corporate body to potential injury through public criticism, federal anti-trust sanctions, and the actions of organized labor. In other words, the power of corporate capitalism was and is contingent upon the ability of corporations to maximize their control over the production and dissemination of their public persona, while simultaneously minimizing public scrutiny of the animating fiction of personification that enables that power in the first place. Of the various media that have contributed to the dominance of corporate capitalism by alleviating the anxiety of embodiment, it is television that has most effectively addressed the corporate dilemma of self-representation. Unlike the movie industry, television has been a corporate medium from its inception. Unlike radio, which could only transmit the corporate voice, the overwhelmingly visual experience of "watching" tele-vision made it an ideal medium for promoting the corporate image, mitigating the pitfalls of visibility, and easing the anxiety of embodiment. General Electric had long been interested in television. As early as 1891, the year before he engineered the merger that formed the General Electric Company, Thomas Edison, while working on the kinetoscope, boasted that he was on the verge of achieving direct transmission of live events into the home?envisioning television as a medium that would enable the affluent owners of his phonographs to receive visual reproductions of opera and musical theatre productions to accompany their recordings. The technological obstacles, however, would prove to be more significant than Edison imagined. It took another half-century before RCA and its broadcasting wing NBC?both founded by GE and its partners in the radio trust? began regular television broadcasting at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Beginning with the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 that inspired Edison to establish his first research laboratory, American industrial and trade exhibitions had consistently linked national destiny and industrial progress to electrical power. The 1939 Fair, however, set a new standard for the reification of the corporation as the nation's body electric. The Fair's theme, "The World of Tomorrow," was designed to restore faith in a corporate sector increasingly perceived to bear responsibility for a decade of economic deprivation and social unrest. The Fair's most popular attractions were the exhibits sponsored by the leading companies (GE, General Motors, Eastman Kodak, AT&amp;T, and RCA) in the fastest growing industries (automobile manufactur ing, electricity and electronics, mass media, and telecommunications). The exhibits propagated a shared vision of social reconstruction in which the electrified commodities produced by the exhibitors were promoted as guarantors of a more prosperous and democratic future. The architecture, exhibits, and multimedia spectacles combined to create a massive Teatrum Mundi in which electricity was not only the most prominent technology on display, but also the means by which visitors would both enter and experience "The World of Tomorrow." As the symbolic window on the future, television's commercial debut at the Fair linked the new medium to the brave new world of consumer culture as envisioned by the Fair's corporate exhibitors. Televisions situated throughout the fairgrounds broadcast the opening ceremonies in which Franklin Roosevelt welcomed visitors and Albert Einstein threw the switch to electrify</page><page sequence="11">the dazzling lighting systems that would illuminate America's future. Visitors were transported via two electric staircases from the base of the Trylon, a 700-foot triangular spire, and into the Perisphere, a 200-foot globe theatre. Here, from two electrically powered revolving platforms suspended just below the "equator" of the great sphere, visitors viewed "Democracity," Henry Dreyfuss's massive model of the core city and its exurban ring rendered in perfect harmony. While the balconies rotated slowly and the lights dimmed to suggest dusk, symphonic music piped through loudspeakers filled the globe and a great chorus heralded the approach of various incarnations of the American workingman, displayed on the dome by movie projectors hidden in the balconies. The narration provided by popular radio newscaster H.V Kaltenborn lent an authoritative voice to the stirring music and populist imagery designed to obscure the conflicts between labor and capital that threatened the continued coexistence of capitalism and democ racy. The six-minute performance concluded with a series of tableaux vivant projections of heroic farmers and industrial workers. These people, as Kaltenborn's inspirational oratory made clear, represented the diversity of American society, and their cooperation would lead to a better life in the new Democracity. The most popular exhibit at the Fair, Norman Bel Geddes's design for the General Motors pavilion, reinforced the vital role of electricity in the imagineering of a post-Depression nation. "Futurama" transported its passengers into the America of 1960, enabling them to ride one of 600 electrically propelled chairs at simulated speeds of up to 100 miles-per-hour while sus pended over a 36,000 square-foot scale model of the United States. The accompanying narra tive, broadcast over loudspeakers attached to each chair, extolled the virtues of a future where "abundant sunshine, fresh air, [and] fine green parkways" would provide access to a world of abundance, and in which the massive skyscrapers and cornucopic farms of Futurama would be connected by shiny seven-lane highways. At the conclusion of the ride visitors were returned to 1939 and deposited in a GM showroom where they were handed a souvenir button that read: "I have seen the future" (Lefcowitz 2002). Significantly, the mise-en-scene for the futuristic visions of Democracity and Futurama? visions of the city and country, labor and capital harmoniously united through the spectacular technologies made possible by electricity?was neither urban nor rural. Visitors strolling through the Fair's "Town of Tomorrow" could not help but conclude that the future would be suburban. Walking the streets of tomorrow town it appeared that, with a few quirky exceptions, the future promised merely newer versions of the same old colonials and ranches. To enter these unexceptional structures, however, was to confront a brave new world of consumer convenience that less than a decade in the future would define the lure of the suburban life and lifestyle. GE's contribution to tomorrow town was an "all electric home" complete with a "Magic Kitchen that moves, talks and tells a timely story" (Jurca 1998:28). The story it told, like that of the architecture, landscaping, and layout of the other 15 demonstration homes on display, was that the nation's future lay somewhere between the urban squalor and rural poverty that together constituted the social imaginary of the Depression. In their own humble way these electrical appliances foreshadowed a tomorrow as breathtakingly new as anything found in Democracity or Futurama. Looking out the window of the Magic Kitchen one could almost see the postwar suburbs springing forth: the rows of single-family homes like tranquil islands dotting a verdant sea of impossibly green lawns, each lavishly equipped with electrically powered devices that promised to fulfill the fantasies of leisure and abundance the Depression had suppressed. The most remarkable technology introduced at the fair, the one that most presciently mirrored the world of tomorrow, was television. "Now we add radio sight to sound," declared David Sarnoff, founder of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) speaking from the RCA pavilion at the Fair: It is with a feeling of humbleness that I come to this moment of announcing the birth of a new art so important in its implications that it is bound to affect all society [...] an art o CO S3 O s&gt; a &amp; ft) co crq CO S3 w )-t 123</page><page sequence="12">which shines like a torch in a troubled world [...] a creative force we must learn to utilize for the benefit of all mankind, (in Lewis 1992:33) As roving camera crews from the National Broadcasting Corporation canvassed the fairgrounds documenting its marvels, visitors shared their opinions of the future on the set NBC had con structed to demonstrate the magic of television. The buttons given to the people who recorded their impressions of the future on camera spoke to the novelty of the new medium, the promise of the world of tomorrow, and the new subjectivity that together they would engender. The simple message inscribed on the buttons they received depicted an act that would transform their lives: "I have been televised." Better Living Built In Three months after the Fair opened, the outbreak of World War II put the future on hold, at least temporarily. While commercial television broadcasting was suspended in the US during World War II, television's role in postwar America was the subject of discussion before the war had ended. Speak ing to an audience of media professionals in 1944, T.F. Joyce, general manager of RCA's Radio-Phonograph Television Department, made the case for television's future prominence in the conversion from war to peace: A nationwide television system is the medium which can arouse the spirit and will of the people. Through skillful use of a nationwide television system, American political, business, labor, religious and social leadership can create in the hearts and minds of America's 134,000,000 people the desire to bring about the peace, security, and plenty that is the dream of every citizen, (in Ewen 1996:386) Begging the question of why a desire for peace, security, and plenty needed to be created when it was already the dream of every citizen, Joyce was not alone in his enthusiasm for television's potential to arouse hearts and minds. His description of the role of the new medium in the postwar production of desire and the marketing of dreams was a characteristic expression of a socioeconomic order anxiously anticipating the transition from a booming wartime economy, and searching for ways to guarantee that peace would not result in another Depression. After the war itself the most anxiety-producing issue for Americans was how to afford tomorrow town. As Cohen demonstrates in A Consumers' Republic, the wartime dreams and desires that dominated Americans' vision of postwar security and prosperity were centered on the private home, typically suburban and "fully equipped with consumer durables" (2003:73). While reaping the benefits of converting its factories for military production during the war, GE was already positioning itself as a principal beneficiary of the housing boom that would serve as J^^B A Jm^^^mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmM Kt /l^^mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmi / ^^mS^^JmMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMm Figure 3. "Being Televised. " Television history was made on 20 April 1939 when David Sarnojf, the president of the Radio Corporation of America, stood before the television cameras and dedicated RCA's pavilion at the 1939 Worlds Fair. The dedication marked the first time a news event was ever covered by television. (?Corbis) 13 Oh s h 124</page><page sequence="13">the engine of the postwar domestic economy. In a typical GE wartime ad that ran in the Satur day Evening Post on 5 June 1943, a soldier sits on a park bench with his adoring gal, sketching a starter home in the sand with a stick. The home is, as the copy informs us, "A promise of gloriously happy days to come...when Victory is won." Reminiscent of GE's Norman Rockwell illustrated and Bruce Barton-authored advertisements of the 1920s linking Protestant theology to GE's light bulb as the bearer of light into darkness, the Victory home campaign employs Protestant eschatology with a twist. Promising future rewards for present sacrifices, the ad does not ask the young couple to defer their dreams until after death but only until Victory is achieved. Then, through the "new comforts, new conveniences, and new economies" of "electrical living," their Victory home will provide them with paradise on earth. The advertise ment's cross promotion of a dizzying array of consumer products and services?household appliances, War Bonds, radio programs, and appliance manuals?is synthesized by GE's corporate logo with its patriotic and democratic "promise" of a new kind of home available to all, with "better living built in." By 1946 the swift fulfillment of GE's promise had become a national priority. Fifteen years of economic instability and war had resulted in the relocation and dislocation of millions of Americans, and an acute housing shortage that would be exacerbated by the return of the troops. The most visible fruits of victory were not immediate prosperity and plenty, but the worst outbreak of labor unrest in history, and a crippling housing shortage that Fortune magazine, in a special issue devoted to the crisis, declared to be the worst "since 1607 when John Smith wondered where he would spend his first night in Virginia" (in Jurca 1998:19). In the same issue, Fortune editor Eric Hodgins, in a short story that introduced Americans to the postwar suburb, offered a potential resolution to both the labor and housing crises. In "Mr. Blandings Builds His Castle," Jim and Muriel Blandings solve their housing crisis by fleeing a dirty overcrowded New York City and their cramped rental apartment for what the real estate ad that inspires their exodus describes as the "sylvan charm" of the "peaceful Connecticut countryside" and the "dream house" that only suburban home ownership can provide. Later that year, "under the more American and democratic title," Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, Hodgins's story became a best-selling novel, followed in 1948 by the movie starring Cary Grant and Myrna Loy (20). In a spectacle of imagineering reminiscent of the "Town of Tomorrow," the promotional campaign for the film featured the construction of 73 "Blandings Dream Houses" across the country. Built with labor, materials, and furnishings donated by companies with a vested interest in stimulating the dream of home ownership, the houses were raffled off to publicize the film. Prominent among the corporate donors was General Electric, whose new "all-electric kitchen" was featured in the film and installed in all the dream houses.5 The Blandings' Dream House campaign typified the new postwar dynamic between corporate capitalism and electronic media. An expanding economy and the introduction of readily available consumer credit and low-rate mortgages meant that an unprecedented number of Americans could now afford home owner ship. The Blandings campaign made it clear that Hollywood would have something to say about what kind of homes they would buy and how they would be outfitted. When Kansas City developer J.C. Nichols proved he could build the same house for less than Blandings paid, the orders poured in. Who wouldn't want to live in Cary Grant's dream house and who could resist such a bargain? If it cost a bit more than was prudent, there was always credit. And besides, a dream house was, as Blandings explains in the film, 5. The use of model homes as a promotional tool was nothing new for GE, which during the 1930s had showcased its "magic home" at fairs and exhibitions. The company had also utilized film tie-ins as a vehicle for marketing its appliances as far back as 1933, when the Warner Brothers-GE Better Times Special, a train rilled with movie stars, traveled from Hollywood to the New York opening of the movie 42nd Street, and then to FDR's inauguration. o w CO S3 Q S&gt; fD fD CO S3 125</page><page sequence="14">like a fine painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, "how much was the paint, how much was the canvas?" You look at it and you say "it is beautiful?I want it." And if it costs a few more pennies, you pay it and gladly, because you love it and you can't measure things you love in dollars and cents. (Panama and Frank 1948) The Blandings campaign demonstrated that electronic media was more than merely another venue for marketing products; its influence in manufacturing dreams and marketing desire made it a critical collaborator in what public relations impres sario and Sigmund Freud's nephew Edward Bernays called the "engineering of consent" for the consumer's republic (1947:113-20). To fully realize the synergies of the electronic media and consumer capitalism, however, would require the widespread deployment of the little box that was just then being installed in the paradigmatic mass produced suburb of Levittown, Long Island?the first planned community to offer homes complete with a built-in tele vision set (Spigel 2001:386). Nowhere was the emerging postwar calculus equating television and suburban home ownership with economic prosperity and national security more evident than in Levittown. In the September 1948 issue of Harpers, the developer of Levittown, William Levitt, famously summarized the relationship between suburban homeownership and democracy: "No man who owns his own house and lot can be a communist [...] He has too much to do" (in Jurca 1998:20). Over the next decade the dominant corporate message was that one of the most patriotic things the suburban homeowner could do was watch television and purchase the products it displayed. Total Electric Living The debut of GE TV Theater marked a new approach for utilizing television to resolve the challenges and exploit the opportunities of the new business landscape created by the postwar economic boom. Wartime production had quadrupled GE's sales volume, and the subsequent postwar expansion of the market for its consumer products increased the size of the company beyond what its administrative structure could handle. In response, GE's president Ralph Cordiner initiated sweeping changes in the management of the company. Radically decentraliz ing the company's operations by restructuring GE from eight profit-and-loss groups into more than 100, Cordiner gave each of the department general managers unprecedented responsibil ity for the new groups. The relative autonomy of the branch offices and factories of GE's far-flung empire resulted in increased economies of speed by localizing decision-making and reducing bureaucratic drag. Decentralization, however, raised a new set of challenges. Em ployees far removed from the corporate metropole often felt like colonial subjects whose loyalties and ambitions were increasingly localized and often at odds with the larger corporate agenda. Similarly, the different and often conflicting requirements for marketing a refrigerator Figure 4. "Too Busy for Communism. "Aerial view ofLevittown, Long Island?Arthur Levitts suburban adaptation of Futurama and Democracity. (?Bettman/Corbis) 13 Oh S h 126</page><page sequence="15">as opposed to a jet engine meant that GE's various divisions were often competing for resources in ways that brought them into conflict with each other and the corporation itself. In addition, the new corporate structure did little to alleviate the increased regulatory scrutiny of GE's corporate practices stimulated by its increased size and stature in strategically important in dustries. Finally, decentralization threatened the carefully crafted corporate image that united GE's diverse holdings and products. In response, Cordiner sought to ameliorate divisional rivalries, stimulate employee's identifi cation with the corporation, mollify antitrust regulators, and invigorate its consumer image through a massive public relations campaign addressed to both the company's nearly 750,000 employees and the consumers and legislators whose goodwill was essential to the corporation's future. Implicit in Cordiner's public relations strategy was the recognition that large corpora tions, like nations, are largely imagined communities. Confronted with a crisis in corporate self representation, the company's president sought the assistance of public relations professionals to define and disseminate a new corporate identity. This identity was constructed to represent for GE's workers and consumers alike what the nation represented for its citizens, what Benedict Anderson defines as "the image of their communion" (1983). For Cordiner the solution to the paradox of corporate self-representation was to promote a belief in the scientific and magical power of electricity as the source of human progress, inspire faith in a better way of life made possible by the products derived from electricity, and to instill in the public imagination the image of GE as the embodiment of that faith. The primary vehicle for Cordiner's corporate image crafting would be television, most notably GE Theater, the corporation's first "all-company project," sponsored not by a particular GE product line or division but by its Department of Public Relations Services. Before GE Theater, GE, like most corporations, had approached television as just another forum for advertising their products. GE's early attempts at company-sponsored television programming, however, had been dismal failures. In the fall of 1948, its first foray into commercial television, the variety show The Dennis James Carnival, was canceled after the first broadcast. Its replace ment, Riddle Me This, a quiz show, lasted just 12 weeks. In April 1949, GE tried again with the musical-variety Fred Waring Show. Waring, a popular bandleader, had already made an indis pensable contribution to consumer culture with his invention of the blender that bears his name, but proved only moderately successful as a television personality, limping along for five years with average ratings and minimal benefit to GE. In a radical shift in sponsoring strategy, rather than promoting the individual products manufactured by its disparate divisions as its previous TV programming had done, Wiring's replacement, GE Theater, was conceived as a revelation of the corporate soul; a vehicle for merchandising brand awareness, corporate identity, and GE's target image as the leading innovator of the electrically enhanced technologies, commodities, and lifestyle that powered the postwar American economy (Dunckel 1982:4-7; Bird n.d.). Cordiner's decision to focus on television as the best medium for representing GE's new corporate soul reflected the speed at which television entered American homes after World War II. In 1947 there were only about 14,000 television sets in the United States. By January of 1952, the Nielsen ratings registered for the first time more televisions than radios in use during prime time hours. That spring?after the FCC lifted its four-year freeze on licensing new stations? stores selling televisions began opening at the rate of a thousand a month. By 1954, the year Reagan began as host, the number of televisions had more than doubled to almost 32 million. By the time Reagan left the show in 1962, television was in 90 percent of American homes, the average American watched five hours of television per day, and TV had replaced movies as American's dominant leisure-time activity. Advertising was the sine qua non of television, and it wasn't long before television became the leading venue for promoting the postwar expansion of consumer markets. By 1952 it had overtaken radio in advertising revenue, and by 1955 it exceeded magazines and newspapers in national advertising.

The effectiveness of television as a marketing tool was unprec edented. But fully exploiting its potential as a medium for the revelation of the corporate soul would require the cultivation of the body electric.6 While Cordiner's strategy for television would ultimately prove successful, the initial response to the anthology format was not what GE had hoped. It was not until the decision was made in the second season to emphasize "consistent company voice advertising" and Reagan was hired that the program became a hit. When Reagan began hosting the show in September 1954, it ranked a mediocre 19th in the Nielsen ratings. By December, after only four months with Reagan as host, the revamped GE Theater had climbed to 10th in the ratings, and had become the most watched weekly dramatic program on television. The washed-up film actor was an instant TV star. Although the ratings peaked during the next season, when the show ranked third among all programs on television, for the duration of its run it consistently placed first in its desirable time slot, nine o'clock on Sunday night, following The Ed Sullivan Show and leading into Alfred Hitchcock Presents (in Wills 1988:319). Reagan's self-described role on the program was that of a "continuing personality on which to hang the production and advertising of the show" (in Moldea 1986:189). As host, Reagan was a constant presence, unifying the disparate offerings?adaptations of popular plays, short stories, novels, magazine fiction, and motion pictures?by introducing and concluding each program. In addition to Reagan, Don Herbert, already a recognizable TV personality as the star of Watch Mr. Wizard, would periodically appear during the intermission between the show's two acts as the "General Electric Progress Reporter" to report on recent developments from "the house of magic," the nickname coined in a 1930s ad campaign to describe GE's research and development laboratory. Eschewing television's standard programming format derived from radio, in which the program's ostensible "content" was punctuated at regular intervals by product advertise ments, the program utilized an intermission between "acts" as an opportunity to inform the public about the company's latest advances in science and technology rather than to advertise specific products. By blurring the boundaries between entertainment and marketing, and presenting corporate promotion in the guise of consumer education, the show introduced a new strategy for exploiting television as a unique medium for "projecting an image to a public that never assembled as such."7 The benefits to be accrued from his association with GE were immediately apparent to Reagan. "From my own viewpoint," he told the Hollywood Reporter less than a year after assum ing his new job, "my kind of an association with a big business firm not only adds half or better to the economic value of my name, but provides a degree of security entirely foreign to the movie business, which is ruled so much by suicidal fluctuations, fads and whims" (in Edwards 1987:459). But what did GE's association with Reagan add to the economic value and security of its name? Reagan's role on the program stemmed from an emerging consensus among advertis ers and media analysts that television's new language of the image required careful attention to the person selected to represent the corporation on TV. In his 1955 report for AT&amp;T on the role of the corporate spokesman on television, media consultant Chester Burger summarized the new thinking: "The person you choose will represent the telephone company to thousands of viewers. His title or official position with the company will be less important to the company [...] and the audience than the impression he makes." Television, Burger instructed, "has its own 6. The statistics on the rise of television ownership, viewing, and advertising revenue in the 1950s can be found in Gamson (1994:41); Fox (1997:210-11); and Spigel (2001:33). 7. This is Stuart Ewen's characterization of the "ascendant definition of corporate public relations activity in the 1950s" (1996:389).</page><page sequence="17">language, its own grammar," requiring the corporate message to be conveyed "through images rather than words." On television,ll The pictures don't illustrate the story; they are the story. The narration merely helps the pictures" (in Ewen 1996:390-91). Thanks to the movies, Reagan had already acquired brand awareness as "Mr. Norm," a persona he easily adapted into the affable electrical everyman who became the embodiment of GE's corporate image. In lieu of commercials promoting GE's products, Reagan, like the corporate logo that inevitably appeared whenever he was on screen, performatively reiterated the corporate image, branding Reagan as, in the words ofT.V Guide, "the ambassador of things mechanical" (in Edwards 1987:461). On television, serving as the ambassador of mechanical reproduction, Reagan brought an aura of mass-mediated celebrity to bear on the production of GE's target image as expressed in its new postwar slogan, "Progress is our most important product." The scaffolding of this new celebrity was constructed shortly after Reagan took over as host. Herbert's "progress reports" introducing viewers to GE's contributions in "Jet Engine Advancement," "Turbosupercharger Progress," "Atomic Safety Devices," and the like, recorded such impressive "impact scores" in audience recall that the polling firm of Gallup-Robinson declared GE Theater to be "the leading institutional campaign on television for selling ideas to the public." The highest score Gallup-Robinson had recorded to date was for "Kitchen of the Future," inspiring GE to launch a campaign to promote its domestic products by encouraging homeowners to "Live Better Electrically" (Bird n.d.). In conjunction with the campaign, GE equipped the modern ranch style house Reagan was building in Pacific Palisades with the latest technology developed by the house of magic?"everything electric," Reagan quipped, "except a chair" (in Edwards 1987:459). In return, Reagan opened his home and offered his family to the show as a testament to the virtues of living better electrically. During Reagan's second season as host he periodically offered viewers a tour of his "Total Electric" house. As a venue for living better electrically, the Reagans' home became the setting for TV's first reality series. Like the Blandings Dream Houses, Reagan's home modeled the benefits of the new suburban lifestyle as a show house for the Consumers' Republic. The first segment, shot while the house was still under construction, was an unabashed promotion of the new lifestyle available to electrically savvy consumers.8 The Reagans and their electrical contractor tour the shell of their new home, demonstrating how to wire a home for "full house power." While the contractor patiently details the technical specifications required to reap the benefits of GE's products, Reagan enthusiastically extols the virtues of the new technology. Nancy, in the role of the naive housewife, poses the questions on the mind of the average viewer yet to be initiated into the mysteries of "total electric living." After much discussion between the men about the benefits of sufficient wiring and abundant circuits and outlets, an increasingly impatient Nancy delivers the ideological hook. Following her husband's particularly condescending explanation that "full house power" means "enough electric power in every one of your circuits, and enough circuits and outlets so that no one of them ever get overloaded," Nancy cuts to the chase. "Well," she declares, speaking to and for the members of the TV audience bored or confused by all this talk of circuits and outlets and wiring, "I'm glad we have it. Because we're going to have some wonderful electric equipment and we want to have all the entertainment and pleasure and comfort out of that equipment that we can. I'm sure that's what you want out of your appliances too" (Reagan 1956). As television's first all-electric family, the Reagans modeled the electrically generated virtues of "entertainment" and "pleasure" and "comfort"?keywords of what cultural historian Thomas Hine has termed the "populuxe" lifestyle (Hine 1986). During the initial postwar period corporations reacted to what Hine describes as "the strongest consumer economy the world had ever seen" by focusing on speed and efficiency in getting affordable products to 8.

Hine identifies 1954, the year Reagan signed on with GE, as the beginning of "the populuxe decade"?the year corporations transformed their sales focus and marketing strate gies to induce consumers to spend their growing disposable incomes on products that had previously been considered luxury items. The term "populuxe," Hine explains, like the torrent of newly affordable consumer gadgets, conjured "an ineffable emotion" by infusing the popular with the trappings of luxury. While American suburbanites never fully endorsed Le Corbusier's functional modernist dictum of the house as a "machine for living in," they eagerly embraced the populuxe fantasy of the modern home chock full of "machines to live with" (Spigel 2001:382-83). Like the houses of "Tomorrow Town," the magic of the homes built during the populuxe era was not to be found in their architecture, but in the cornucopia of "space age" devices contained within. In what Hine characterizes as a "reversal of the age-old pattern in which seats of government and houses of worship received the highest craftsmanship and ornamentation a society could produce while the individual house was relatively bare," the suburban house became a showcase for a design aesthetic derived not from European modern ism but from the democratic promise of American capitalism (1986:14). More than mere con venience, the machines GE installed in the Reagan's new home symbolized the achievement of a style of living?a level of entertainment, pleasure, and comfort?previously unaffordable for all but the very wealthy. In subsequent programs the Reagan's new home served as a mise-en-scene for the multiple pleasures of an electrically enhanced lifestyle, demonstrating how GE's cutting-edge electrical technology provided mastery over nature and democratic access to an aristocratic way of life. Inserted in the intermission between the two acts of the weekly drama, the segments on the Reagan's new home demonstrated how total electric living provided the Utopian resolution to the ideological tensions of American Exceptionalism represented in the teleplays. Introducing a 1957 episode entitled "Too Good with a Gun," Reagan picks up a prop six-shooter and spins the cylinder: A man's talent's may be used for good or evil. Exceptional talents only widen the possi bilities for both. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the young communities of the American West some 80 years ago. Our story tonight takes place in such a community where men were struggling towards that stability and peace so badly needed. (Reagan 1957a) At the end of the first act, Slick Everret, the bully who has disrupted the peaceful town "where most men's guns are so rusty they don't shoot," lies dead in the street; shot by the reluctant gunfighter who is too good with a gun to escape the death and destruction that results from his unique talent. Cross-fade to Mr. Wizard, who announces, "Tonight we're going visiting at the Ronald Reagans' again in their new home to see how their many wonderful electric servants are helping them, just as they'll help you, 'Live Better Electrically.'" Cut to Ronald, Nancy, and four-year old Patti who are sitting at the breakfast table eating a "perfect meal" made by Nancy's electric servants. The English muffins, they inform the viewer, were prepared in their new toaster, and the cheese on top was melted in their toaster oven. The "steady heat and automatic timing" of their new electric skillet, Nancy explains, "makes a tricky dish like souffle easy and safe to make." "My electric appliances do everything," purrs Nancy. "What's elesses aplotz?" asks little Patti. "They're all the things around the house that make mommy's work easier." "Tell you what Patti," dad chimes in enthusiastically, "let's see how many electric appliances we can find around the house."</page><page sequence="19">|; :^ .^^^^^^^^ *mM j tgmmSS^SBI^1^ _ MB! -. - *:j^H|^f ilm ^sKKKKKKKlr^ ^H^. il Figure 5.

Another heavily promoted benefit of the virtues of total electric living was the introduction into the home of new technologies of mechanical reproduction. In a segment touting the entertainment systems provided for them by GE, Reagan describes traveling a hundred miles to Chicago as a child to see his first play.9 "Think how much different it is today [...] Here at our new home if we want entertainment," he demonstrates, proudly opening his TV cabinet, "all we do is flick a switch and electricity brings it to us." Opening the sliding glass door to his patio, Reagan reveals a spectacular view of Los Angeles and the Pacific, and "a portable televi sion set" the Reagans use to watch TV "on the patio or by the pool." Encouraging the viewer to "enjoy the ballgame, see the latest news of the world, see the great stars of the theatre," Reagan makes it clear that television is the ideal substitute for firsthand knowledge of the world (Reagan 1957b). Like their television, Nancy informs us, her new transistor radio, sheathed in a "real top grain leather" case, "can be a great deal of company. And it can go even more places; around the home or on picnics or on fishing trips." Demonstrating another "important source of entertain ment," Reagan unveils their "projection machine for home movies," hidden in an alcove covered by a framed painting of a sailboat. Opening yet another wall cabinet, Nancy demonstrates their "new high fidelity": "Remem ber what a difference there used to be between home listening and the concert hall?" Reagan remarks. "It's almost as if the orchestra were playing right here in the living room," Nancy chimes in. Slipping his arm around his wife's waist, Reagan seals the deal: As you can see, we're enjoying all the entertainment electricity can bring us. So can you. There's no trick to it. It's just a matter of starting in easy stages, one item at a time. The first thing you know, you and your family will begin to [Nancy joins in for the chorus] "Live Better Electrically." (Reagan 1957b) Like the patio doors and picture windows that frame the Reagans' view of an arid desert transformed into a thriving metropolis through the auspices of capitalism and mass media, their entertainment technologies enable the Reagans to imaginatively picture the pleasures available by living better electrically without ever leaving the comfort of their home. Why would anybody ever leave the house when the whole world was accessible from home merely by purchasing these products "in easy stages," with easy credit conveniently provided by GE through the GE Credit Corporation. While the vast majority of televisions and television shows were still black and white, the Reagan's TV offered a vision of the future through the "pleasure and excitement" of color. In a subsequent tour that touted the virtues of "modern light conditioning," the Reagans stressed the importance of introducing color into the home through lighting to create "a more livable house." The reasons they give for doing so materialize the ideological dimensions of the Consumer's Republic, as well as the Utopian promise of total electric living. The adjectives Nancy uses to describe the Reagans' various lighting devices?"eye catching," "marvelous," "interesting"?are those of a world made familiar to the viewer by the entertainment technolo gies scattered throughout the house. The multicolored house made possible by the colored lights that Nancy can "change" and "mix" to "get different effects" by "turning the knobs of [a] 9.

As the former film actress informs us, these colors are not simply yellow, blue, and pink, but "warm," "cool," and "flattering." They produce a light that does not simply illuminate the home but alters its "mood," enabling the Reagans "to see better and look better and live better in our home." Of course most viewers can't see the colors Nancy describes because they don't yet own a color TV. But they know what she means. Even in black and white they recognize what it means to be warm or cool. They want their light to flatter them. They want their light to make them eye-catching, interest ing, and to "do marvelous things" for them. They know and want these things because elec tronic media has taught them new ways to imagine how to look, sound, and feel. On GE TV Theater, Ronald Reagan was introduced to the first TV generation and would become one of the most visible patriots of the empire created by the cold war consumer revolution. "I am seen by more people in one week [on television]," Reagan marveled, "than I am in a full year in movie theaters" (in Morris 1999:304-05). By 1958, according to one survey, Reagan was one of the most recognized men in the country. He would prove to be such an effective celebrity salesman that a joke began to make the rounds in Hollywood that after listening to his spiel for GE's nuclear submarine, one viewer remarked, "I didn't really need a submarine, but I've got one now" (in Edwards 1987:460). "Mr. Norm" had become the popular embodiment, the ambassador, of the virtues of living better electrically. GE TV Theater estab lished Reagan as a new kind of celebrity peculiar to television; not the Western hero he had aspired to become as a film actor but a corporate icon, "The Actor in the Gray Flannel Suit" as the film industry took to calling him, "as intimately identified with the corporation as its advertising slogan or trademark logo" (McDougal 1998:191). This new celebrity archetype is coterminous with the advent of television, and reflects television's genealogy as a medium and industry shaped from the outset by the imperatives of corporate capitalism and the performance of mass-mediated celebrity. Reagan's television celebrity and political prominence, like GE TV Theater itself, was a product of this new vision of the imagined community of the nation powered by the body electric. Figure 6. "Modern Light Conditioning.

The new economic order that emerged with the erosion of the Hollywood studio system in the 1950s enhanced the profile of performer-oriented somniprac tors like the talent agent, who could now, in Raymond Chandler's caustic summary, "create packaging corporations which delivered complete shows to the networks or the advertising agencies [and load] them with talent, which sometimes under another corporate name, he represented as an agent. He [takes] his commission for getting you a job, and then he [sells] the job itself for an additional profit" (1952:51). Chandler's scenario perfectly describes MCA's arrangement with BBD&amp;O. While the arrival of the cavalry that rescued Reagan from a floundering film career may have been dramatic, its source could hardly have been as unexpected as Reagan recalls. In 1952, as president of SAG, Reagan had negotiated an unprecedented blanket waiver that made MCA?headed by Reagan's long-time agent, Lew Wasserman?the only talent agency permitted to produce their own shows for television. In exchange for grant ing Guild members residuals when no other production companies would, MCA became the only company granted the unlimited right to both produce television shows and represent the labor that made them. By the time Reagan left the show in 1962 the original talent agency accounted for only 10 percent of MCA's income. Less than a decade after receiving the waiver, MCA had parlayed the huge competitive advantage Reagan had negotiated for it into a hori zontally and vertically integrated entertainment conglomerate that controlled over 40 percent of all primetime television and 60 percent of the entertainment industry as a whole (Wills 1988:317-18,324). By 1961, MCA's astonishing growth had drawn the attention of the Justice Department. Eight separate antitrust investigations probed the legality of the company's dealings, including the waiver Reagan had granted. Testifying before a federal grand jury in Hollywood in 1962, Reagan answered questions regarding how he might have profited from the waiver. Reagan's sketchy memory of the details surrounding his negotiations with MCA was convenient, and his disavowal of any benefits he or MCA might have derived from the waiver was unconvincing. His testimony as to his value to GE, however, was not so farfetched. In disputing the charge that his job with GE represented a quid pro quo arrangement with MCA, Reagan proposed an alternative reason for why he felt more secure as an employee of General Electric than he ever had while working at Warner Brothers: General Electric was having me go on tours. Each year I go on tours all over the country and make speeches. [...] It was never done by anyone else in the television business so it was apparent that I had a value, a relationship to General Electric that was probably sufficient above and beyond the show, that if the show wasn't successful they would still retain me. (inMoldea 1986:193) In later years, Reagan would characterize his value as a "kind of goodwill ambassador from the home office," whose tours played a "supporting role in an extraordinary experiment by American industry," helping to ameliorate the tensions produced by Cordiner's new decentral ized management structure by forging "a closer link between the plants and the communities where they were located" (Reagan 1990:126-27). The tours were also the venue for fusing Reagan's embodiment of the corporation's public image into the body electric that would define him as a political performer. The idea for the plant tours originated with Earl Dunkel, a former newspaperman who started at GE as a "communicator," was promoted to advertising account supervisor, and when Reagan joined the company was assigned the task of "audience promotion" for the television show. The show represented a new direction in corporate promotion and not everyone in the company was sold on the concept. The initial objective of the tour as Dunkel conceived it "was to have [Reagan] meet and charm [...] GE vice presidents all over the country so they would stay off our backs</page><page sequence="23">long enough for us to get the program moving." Because GE had around 700,000 employees, the tour, in addition to serving as "an employee communication device," would also function as "an audience promotion device" (Dunkel 1982:1, 6). Initially, Reagan's plant visits consisted largely of meet-and-greets with production line workers. It didn't take long, however, for regional managers to recognize the community relations benefits of his celebrity, and they began asking Reagan to deliver a few remarks at their clubs and civic organizations. What began with fielding questions about what it was like to kiss Ann Sheridan evolved into lengthy speeches defending Hollywood, promoting corporate values and the free enterprise system, and warning against the threat to liberty and property posed by excessive taxation, big government, and the communist menace. Over the next eight years, touring between six and sixteen weeks a year, Reagan honed his elocutionary skills and prepared the ground for his entry into politics. Making as many as 14 speeches a day, Reagan, by his own estimate, spent 250,000 minutes in front of a microphone (Reagan 1965:229). Reagan peddled his message to over a quarter-of-a-million workers in GE factories in 42 states, "to local chambers of commerce, school boards, garden clubs, union halls, and Rotary meetings. He plugged it on promotional tours to city councils and to convention eers. He hawked it to Shriners, to Masons, to Knights of Columbus. He marketed it to the Kiwanis, the Lions, the Elks, the American Legion" (Kelley 1991:104). In the process, Reagan achieved a visibility and public awareness far greater than he ever had as a movie actor. As preparation for politics, the tours presented Reagan with an invaluable opportunity to educate himself in the ways and means of sympathetic magic. On tour, Reagan, who had always appreciated his audience, was able to observe firsthand what that audience cared about, what it believed in, how it worked. Hours spent on the factory floor, in auditoriums, and in banquet halls, speaking with and delivering speeches to a cross-section of the American electorate, served as rehearsals for the kind of performances required by political campaigning. Unlike many celebrity speakers, who attend the event they are hired to address just long enough to speak, shake a few hands, and sign a few autographs, Reagan used the pre-speech cocktail and banquet time to size-up his audience. His memories of the General Electric years were inevitably summarized by anecdotes affirming his conviction that, as he asserts in Where's the Rest of Me?, "No barnstorming politician ever met the people on quite such a common footing." In his live performances on tour, Reagan was able to recapture the sense he had felt as a freshman at Eureka College addressing striking students, the sense that he was "together" with his audience. "Sometimes," he wrote, "I had an awesome, shivering feeling that America was making a personal appearance for me, and it made me the biggest fan in the world" (Reagan 1965:198). As the most visible representative of the company that manufactured the biggest fan in the world, Reagan cultivated a relationship of mutual fandom with his audience that would become a critical component of his future political success. Throughout his political career Reagan rarely pandered to his audience or altered his beliefs in response to public opinion; his repudia tion of his New Deal roots and growing neoconservativism remained steadfast. On tour for GE, however, Reagan learned how to tailor his presentation of the ideas that his education had bestowed upon him to his audience. Previews and tours of the provinces were where the performance was crafted, the production's rough edges smoothed and polished, and the brand tested for television. Reagan would then adapt the audience-tested talks he gave on tour into a controllable and transferable form; a distillation of his best material, variations of which he would give for the rest of his life. Codified as "The Speech," his stirring rendition of the script in a televised address in support of Barry Goldwater's presidential candidacy in 1964 made Reagan, in journalist David Broder's words, "a political star overnight" (in Wills 1988:347). With his star-making television debut as a primetime politician, Reagan had, as he recounts in the final words of his autobiography, "found the rest of me." As a TV star, corporate spokesman, and barnstorming ideologue, Reagan became the electronic media's answer to the nation-building role of the 19th-century actor. Schooled in 3 el s' n % v&gt; crq v&gt; 3 W t V&gt; 3 O 135</page><page sequence="24">"53 Oh as 6 h 136 the entertainment industry, he had learned the theatrical and political lesson that Dracula author and Henry Irving's business manager Bram Stoker had gleaned through observing the most widely emulated performer prior to the advent of mass media, that "without an audience in sympathy no actor can do his best" (in King 1993:40). Plugging the GE brand Reagan acquired the techne that enabled him to, as W.D. King writes of Irving, "foster elite expectations without recourse to class prejudice and without disrupting the essentially middle-class base of his audience" (41). Through his television celebrity and house tours, Reagan connected his audience to the new imagi-nation of the consumer's republic. The populuxe desires fostered by Reagan's performances were not limited to the worldly goods available through GE's credit division. Over the course of his career as a performer, Reagan cultivated association with prominent members of the social and cultural elite and, like Irving, "took care that the bulk of the crowd should feel at one with them, contiguous with eminence and wealth and authority" (King 1993:41). Much as Irving was credited with generating a "revolution in the attitude of the English people towards the calling of the actor" that coincided with "a revolution in the attitude of the English people towards itself as an audience" (39), Reagan would transform middle class Americans' attitudes towards the actor as a player on the political stage at the same time television was transforming Americans' ideas about themselves as an audience of social actors. By the mid-1960s, the virtues of living better electrically would be challenged by a counter culture advocating an anti-material lifestyle and secession from the republic of consumption. Their rallying cry advocated better living?not through electricity but through chemistry. Their mantra, "tune in, turn on, drop out," was not a celebration of the couch potato but a defiant rejection of the teachings of television and its spectacle of mass consumption. Yet by the late 1970s, this TV generation raised in the suburbs and on television, and schooled in the values of the consumer's republic, would elect Ronald Reagan president. One of the reasons Reagan's career change was so successful is that the unionized factory workers and suburban warriors that formed the vanguard of the Reagan Revolution did not perceive him to be a politician.10 He had let them into his house and he had sold them his appliances. They viewed him and knew him as the man who taught them that progress was our most important product, and how to live better electrically. He wasn't the actor who shot Lincoln. He was the "progress" man. It was a curious appellation, to be sure, for the standard bearer of a Conservative revolution. But that was the point. That's why it worked. Progress and nostalgia, ideology and Utopia, no taxation but plenty of representation?these were the promises made by Mr. Norm, The Great Communicator, and the Ambassador of Things Mechanical. The nicknames, monikers, epithets flowed so easily with Ronald Reagan, and they all sounded like movie titles or television shows. The temptation is to dismiss the verbiage as hype, an advertising pitch, a product of the inflated claims made for celebrities or just good public relations. Yes?Reagan was not only a product of and a salesman for the Consumer's Republic, he represented it all the way to the White House. The relation ship between Reagan, GE, and television in the 1950s suggests that the story of the Reagan Revolution cannot be adequately explained, as it characteristically is, by the waning of postwar liberalism's ideological lure and the rise of the new conservatism. To fully appreciate the legacy of Reaganism requires recognizing the capacity of corporate capitalism and mass-mediation to shape the body politic through the body electric.
