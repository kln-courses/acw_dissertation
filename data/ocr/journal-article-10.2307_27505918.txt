Not infrequently, pastoral counselors find themselves praying for clients. This article explores the pastoral counselor's use of petitionary prayer, experientially and theologically, and attempts to lo cate its meaning within the healing enterprise. As Mozart plays in the background, I take a moment to gaze out the bay win dow over my desk. Something on a page I've been reading has touched off a memory of yesterday's session with Michael. He has struggled for so long. Slowly, I'm beginning to learn the outlines of his struggles, the daily mile stones that have led him to my office. Yesterday was a day for confrontation. The interpretation struck a chord with Michael, evoking some memories, some tears, and a deeper level of relat ing between us. And now, as I look out at the patterns of black branches and gently tumbling snow beyond the window's glass, I wonder what he will do with the experience. In this quiet moment I'm reminded that I care about what he does with it all. A picture comes to my mind: the two of us, sitting in the of fice overlooking the river. As I reconstruct his posture, the cast of his eyes, the earnestness of his expression, the picture clarifies and I hear myself saying: "Lord, heal him. Give him the courage to grow through his struggles. And, please, let me be part of his healing journey. Strengthen my empathy and my wisdom so I can be helpful." As the picture begins to fade, I sense a presence in the room with the two of us. It enfolds us both in warmth and care. It binds us together and strengthens us both. And, as I return to my desk and Mozart's harmony, I find my spirit is lighter and more hopeful. The afternoon light seems brighter. I look forward to our next meeting. I want to address the question: What is the place, if any, for petitionary prayer in our lives as pastoral counselors? More specifically, what sense might it make to pray for our clients? I believe the answers to this question are nei ther insignificant nor irrelevant. For me the process of attempting an answer involves several prior questions about prayer, especially prayer of petition, and about pastoral counseling. Take a concrete situation in the life of any therapist. The therapist is on the way home, or reading, or writing process notes. Spontaneously, fantasies arise The Rev. Oliver J. Morgan, S.J., is a doctoral student in pastoral psychotherapy at Boston University. 149 ? 1987 Institutes of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="2">150 Journal of Religion and Health about a particular client. Perhaps the therapist feels concerned or compassion ate, or feels worried or hopeful, wondering about the route this particular jour ney of healing will take or about interventions that have been made. Embed ded within the fantasies, he or she may discover a deep empathy and care for the client and will be moved to recommit the best energies available for help in the healing process. This can be a deeply moving and not infrequently experi enced moment of compassion on the part of the therapist. For the pastoral ther apist such moments can also be catalysts for an explicitly prayerful response. Welling up from personal depths and directed specifically to God, the pastoral therapist finds him- or herself praying for a client. What is happening here? What is prayer? All genuine prayer is first and foremost a response. It is the response of a whole person?mind and heart?cognition, will, and affectivity. It is a human re sponse and a human activity, and as such is open to all the vicissitudes of hu man experience. The response that is prayer is also radically contextual; it arises as response to situations. When confronted with situations of wonder, of giftedness, of limits, of needs, it is not uncommon for people to respond with prayer. As counselors, situated within a pastoral context of caring for souls and psyches, praying for clients can be seen as a response in context. Finally, prayer is response to an initiative. We are invited in our Scriptures and in the depths of our hearts to "pray always." It is God's gracious, and often very sub tle, initiative that invites us to pray?to pray as whole and situated persons; to pray as both expression of, and deepening realization of, who we are. Crucial to the Judeo-Christian sensibility is the affirmation of the relational aspect of prayer; it is response to an Other. Prayer is seen as "personal," not in an anthropomorphic or idolatrous sense, but in the deepest sense of dialogue between "those who care," of mutual presence between two centers of freedom, of "I-Thou." The traditional images?Lord of the universe, Creator, Savior, "Our Father"?speak an important truth. God is addressed as a true Thou, One with whom I can be in relationship, One who is mysteriously gracious and acts on my behalf. Prayer, then, as personal response to a personal initiative, is at its most authentic, as availability for mutual presence, as making myself present for I-Thou encounter. Why pray for clients? It is common in liturgical or group prayer situations to be very specific in our requests. We often find ourselves praying with specific "effects" in mind. We pray for successes and for help through times of difficulty. We pray for greater skill and empathy; we pray for health for ourselves and those we love, healing for those in our care. However, if we are honest, we are dimly aware that this is not yet at the heart of our prayer. In our world of rationalism and scientism how could it be? Very often our prayers are not answered in ways we would</page><page sequence="3">Oliver J. Morgan 151 choose. Inevitably, this must raise a kind of dissonance for us. Here we are, praying for good things (at least, so it seems to us) from a kindly and omnipo tent God, and yet failures come, our empathy and wisdom seem woefully inad equate, sickness, suffering, and even death are visited on our loved ones and on our clients. The "effects" we hoped and prayed for do not materialize, or appear to be terribly tardy. At such moments, because we are contemporary and culture-bound crea tures, we are tempted to give up prayer. Let us be honest. This is a real and very understandable option. Many, I believe, choose this road. However, there can be another way. This is a crisis moment that can also be a moment of op portunity. Not to receive what we ostensibly want or need can be a catalyst for looking beyond, for deeply searching into what we are really doing. If we can stay with the dissonance, if we can stave off foreclosing the crisis, perhaps we can find ourselves approaching the heart of true prayer. Relational, personal response?what could this mean in prayer but relation ship between creature and Creator, between finite mystery and Infinite Mys tery, between one who searches and One who finds? At this moment, perhaps, we can glimpse the reality of Job, and the Psalmists, and Jesus in the Garden ?God is not bound by our requests; God's response is free. And, like so many before us, we begin to learn that what we have really been doing is standing before the reality of Mystery. We have brought ourselves and our concerns and our clients to prayer as a way of expressing and realizing who we are, and who God is. Nothing more. We stand before the face of God as Holy Mystery, as One whose promise is life, and companionship and salvation. Prayer is our personal response, a response-in-person, to the One who loves us first and promises to love us forever. It is our way of being ourselves while letting God be God. At its heart prayer is simple presence and response that does not ask itself how it will be answered. It is confident of the response, for at its deepest level it says, "Thy will be done." True prayer, then, has the character of letting go and surrender. The mutual presence and companionship that occur at this level of prayer are experienced as the goal of what has been sought; Mystery has be come companionable. Mutual embrace becomes possible. Give us this day All prayer, especially prayer of petition, is a way to stand before the God who cares and who can be addressed?simply that. All else comes as a gift. It is a turning toward the One who loves us, a coming into God's presence. As we mature in a life of prayer, we begin to understand that this mutual presence with God is what has been sought within our specific requests. Our awareness shifts?from recognizing our "needs" to placing "ourselves in need" before God. This is crucial for authentic prayer, but is it fully sufficient? For our concerns are real, our struggles are important, and our empathy for those whom we bring to prayer is genuine. Our clients are an essential part of our life context, and we work diligently on their behalf. In prayer we arrive at a deeper awareness that our lives and the lives of our</page><page sequence="4">152 Journal of Religion and Health clients are embedded within a spiritual context of God's caring presence. In God "we live and move and have our being." However, it is also true that a more specific context has given rise to my prayers. Our work together in pastoral counseling has become a situation of care and need. This is an "incar national" context for prayer. For prayer which is authentically situational, these two sides?spiritual and incarnational?must not finally be divorced. Genuine prayer becomes simultaneously incarnational, or it dies. And so there must be a return to the concrete. We find ourselves more deeply aware of God's presence and surrendering in faith, yet emphatically affirming our desires and needs once again, this time, however, in a different voice. What we begin to notice within our actual prayer is a renewed address to God with the childlike voice of one who asks for a gift from a loving parent. Increasingly this harmonizes with the childlikeness of the Gospels and the Psalms, and can make its appearance only alongside growing spiritual and psychological matu rity. Prayer becomes more deeply integrated with our work, as mutual pres ence of therapist and client, both standing in the presence of God. What happens as prayer matures? In this process liberation occurs. There is a liberation of identity. I am no longer "the healer" who carries the full, grandiose burden of responsibility. I am a col laborator in the process of healing, working together with my client and with God. The "healing alliance" is placed into God's hands as the wider context of care. There is also, then, a liberation of context. The "holding environment" so important for clinical and pastoral work is expanded within my awareness to include the "reign" of God's healing and salvation. There can be as well a liber ation for listening. As I begin to hear the struggles and fears, the inadequacies and "sins" of my client's journey, I can more genuinely identify with the com mon humanity we both share as fellow travelers in the presence of God's invi tation to wholeness. "Community" is built and nourished as part of the healing process. Such liberating "effects" of authentic petitionary prayer may not have been the actual effects for which I prayed. But they are indeed extraordinary gifts, and may in fact be critically important "answers" to my requests. The aware ness and resonances they engender may deeply influence the healing environ ment and process in essential ways. The experience of these gifts, welcome and often unlooked-for, becomes a window opening out to a view of Mystery as gracious. The gifts signal the pres ence of the Giver. And, in doing so, they catch us up once again in the heart of true prayer: response and presence. Petitionary prayer realizes itself as prayer: I stand with my client before the God who is Companion and is ad dressed, "Father .. . Thy will be done.. .. Give us this day our daily bread."</page></plain_text>
