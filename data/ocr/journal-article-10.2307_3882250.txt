Introduction to the Symposium: Social Behavior in Reptiles Neil Greenberg Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior, National Institute ofMental Health, POB 79, Poolesville, Maryland 20837 AND David Crews Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 George Cuvier, from his perspective as the most eminent of nineteenth cen? tury pre-Darwinian natural scientists, per? ceived reptiles (and other "lower" verte? brates) as incapable of experiencing vigor- ous sensations and strong passions. Such beasts were subject to greatly diminished stimulation due to their reduced cranial capacity. Indeed, Cuvier believed that if their nervous systems were more like those of mammals or birds, increased passions would overwhelm their meager muscular resources (Coleman 1964). Cuvier's dismal view of reptiles may have been unduly influenced by tradi- tion?the very word "reptile" derives from the Latin repto, to crawl. But the value of a fresh and objective perspective was not unknown ? 200 years before Cuvier, Francis Bacon, in his Novum Organum, analyzed the hindrances to gaining knowl? edge: anthropomorphism, prejudice, in- exactness of language, and impatience. Bacon prepared us to understand that we must enter the Kingdom of Man which is founded in the Sciences as we should enter the Kingdom of God?in the condition of little children. Eschewing the view of reptiles as incom? plete mammals, shedding our ancient prejudices, and patiently considering rep? tiles in their eco-evolutionary context, we believe that they can provide innumerable opportunities to observe "natural experi? ments" which are sometimes uniquely amenable to transplantation and manipu- lation in the laboratory. Indeed, reptiles challenge other classes of vertebrates as candidates for research into diverse fields. We trust that this symposium will prove Cuvier wrong and support an enlightened view of the scientific interest and utility of this often neglected and occasionally ma- ligned class. Despite the pioneering efforts of Noble and Bradley (1933), B. Greenberg, L. T. Evans, and others (see Ferguson, 1977), and the early attention drawn to reptile behavior by Lorenz (1934), research in reptile social behavior has only in the last two decades begun to develop an internal consistency and integrative perspective. Much of the recent interest in reptiles dates from Charles C. Carpenter's de? velopment of a means of objectifying the patterns of movement utilized by display- ing iguanids, the "display action pattern," and his attempts to develop objective categories and units to deal with relevant parameters of social behavior (1961, 1962). Based on an increasingly firm founda? tion in descriptive work, reptile behavioral research has radiated into areas as diverse as behavioral causation (neural and hor? monal correlates, ontogeny) and function (homeostasis, ecological adaptation, and evolution). Much ofthe progress ofthe last two decades is reflected in two symposia: one on lizard ecology (Milstead, 1967) and a more recent symposium on the behavior and neurology of lizards (Greenberg and 153</page><page sequence="2">154 Neil Greenberg and David Crews MacLean, 1977). Whether as paradigms for investigating behavioral phenomena in other taxa or as illustrations of alternative lifestyles, recent research with reptiles piques both our fascination with the un- familiar and our desires to explore the diversities and commonalities in fellow creatures caught up with us in the Great Web of Life.
