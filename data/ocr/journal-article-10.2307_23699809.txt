<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ted Turner's Corporate Cross-Dressing and the Shifting Images of American Business Leadership ERIC GUTHEY The media celebration of media owner Ted Turner's career and personal biography reflects important shifts in the image of Ameri can corporate leadership over the past thirty years. Even aspects of Turner's life we would normally consider private, such as his sex life and his marriage to Jane Fonda, have taken on this very public function. As a result Turner has served as a transitional figure between two competing visions of corporate identity and responsibility: paternalist managerialism and the "real entity" theory of the firm on the one hand, and on the other, antimanagerial market adventurism and the new economic theory of the firm as a nexus of contracts. The story of how Turner has come to serve this gender-charged iconic function helps clarify how the balance of representational power continues to shift back and forth between these two visions during a period of considerable upheaval in the social, legal, and symbolic construction of the American corporation. In May 1985 a New York Times op-ed piece about Ted Turner's hos tile takeover bid for the CBS television network invoked the time worn tale of healthy male overtures frustrated by feminine diffi dence. "When Ted Turner came a-courtin' to CBS a few years back, this most proud and disdainful of maidens turned him a cold shoul der," observed James Traub, then of the cable trade magazine Chan nels. Traub went on to reason that, since CBS had rebuffed Turner's more chivalrous advances, the businessman elsewhere lionized as "Captain Outrageous" and the "Superstation Superman" had no Enterprise &amp; Society 2 (March 2001): 111-142. © 2001 by the Business His tory Conference.

"Now he's threatening to carry the net work off kicking and screaming," he said, "and I for one hope he gets away with it." The cartoon that ran with the piece celebrated Turn er's latest business adventure with equally macho imagery. Turner appeared as a robust sailor with a ring in his ear, ready to harpoon a monstrous white whale with the CBS logo for an eye.1 CBS patriarch William Paley, quoted in the Times the same day, held Turner's predatory action in such contempt that he would refer to his brash young rival only obliquely. "I want above all to insure that CBS remains in good hands, now and forevermore," Paley said in the staid tone of a practiced paternalist. "This means in reliable, competent, responsible hands. It means in the hands of people who understand the unique public responsibility . . . inherent in the man agement of this company, and who have the skill and the talent and the courage, and, when necessary, the self-discipline and forbear ance, to meet that responsibility wisely and well."2 Other CBS execu tives sought to convey more directly the idea that the upstart Turner, who had publicly denounced CBS as a "cheap whorehouse" run by "sleaze artists," was himself a dangerous and unsavory character. CBS chairman Thomas H. Wyman charged that Turner "lacked the conscience" to run a broadcast network, while an executive speaking on behalf of CBS affiliates complained that Turner would damage CBS's "well-deserved reputation for public service."3 Journalist Hank Whittemore would later describe this culture clash between Turner and CBS by invoking the image of the ersatz rebel outsider, actor James Dean. The "Northeast media establishment" had spurned Turner because "he was not in the same class—the way James Dean's Jett Rink in 'Giant' could never become a Texas blueblood," wrote Whittemore. "Now here was Turner, hell-bent on building an em pire, striding into Manhattan as if wearing Rink's cowboy boots, Le vi's, vest, wrinkled shirt, and 10-gallon hat: cockiness incarnate."4 Turner's bid for CBS soon collapsed, but the habit of imagining and even conducting corporate and financial activity according to such heavy-handed masculine terms did not begin or end with this episode. In the United States during the 1980s, business rhetoric and the mass media often framed takeover events as rapes, with target 1.

In The Preda tor's Ball, Connie Brack described how the takeover financing engine Drexel Burnham Lambert flattered clients' prowess by staffing cock tail parties at its High Yield Bond Conference with "girls" paid on a scale that varied, according to Drexel executives, "depending on how pretty they are, and what they'll do." Oliver Stone both lampooned and perpetuated this emergent stereotype of the businessman as li bidinous predator in his 1987 film Wall Street. In that film, traders simulate market prowess by pumping their hips lasciviously, and the protagonist is serviced by a prostitute as compensation for the fi nancial services he performs for the predatory corporate raider Gor don Gekko. As the woman gets on her knees in the back of a limou sine, she talks breathlessly about the market and remarks that Charlie Sheen's character seems "really hot" for a particular stock. "It's about to take off," he replies as she unzips his pants. "I'd jump all over it if I were you."6 In these and a variety of other striking new ways during the 1980s, financial power and corporate agency became synonymous with a particular kind of male sexual potency. What are we to make of this juxtaposition of market aggression and sexual activity? It is tempting to dismiss it all as lurid tabloid excess, but I propose that such meta phors be taken seriously, as a window into an important shift in the social and legal understanding of American corporate leadership. As I will demonstrate, this kind of language and imagery points toward an attack on the traditional rhetorical construction of corporate lead ership in the austere, paternalistic, and hierarchical terms familiar to a William Paley. According to the gendered cultural logic of the take over era, Paley's brand of paternalist managerialism was figuratively feminized, and then sexually assaulted, by a more competitive and predatory-masculine mode of corporate populism for which Ted Turner has served as the premier poster boy. By 1994, however, Turner, the figure of "cockiness incarnate," would cry out that he was being emasculated—actually, he com pared himself to young Egyptian girls being clitoridectomized— when the corporate behemoth Time Warner Inc. used its voting con 5.

That is, they masked a deeply rooted fear of the perceived "feminizing" influence of corpo rate organization, and smoothed over a gender-charged contradiction built into the rhetorical construction of corporate identity in the United States from the emergence of the managerial firm itself. An analysis of the stark contrast between Ted Turner's now hypermas culine, now somehow feminized public image—his corporate cross dressing, if you will—can help highlight this contradiction, which we can state briefly as follows: because the popular culture of Ameri can liberalism frames unfettered individual agency and economic ac tivity as inherently masculine, the decidedly fettered and bureau cratic notion of corporate organization becomes a threateningly feminine prospect. Paternalist managerialism and predatory market machismo represent two different, sometimes competing and some times mutually reinforcing, strategies for responding to this threat by legitimizing corporate agency in masculine terms.8 A closer look at Ted Turner can help illuminate the relationship between these two discourses because his personal biography re flects the shifting and sometimes conflicting ways that American cor porate leadership has sought to represent and legitimize itself over the last several decades. Even aspects of Turner's life that we would normally consider private, such as his sex life and his romance with and marriage to Jane Fonda, have taken on a very public function at significant moments over the last thirty years. Turner is simultane ously an icon of hypermasculinity, entrepreneurial energy, and anti managerial aggression and a management figurehead and the largest shareholder in the most powerful media corporation in the world. Since his billion-dollar gift to the United Nations in 1997, he is also one of the most well-known living philanthropists and self-styled prophets of global corporate benevolence. As such he serves as a transitional figure between two competing visions of corporate iden tity and responsibility: between paternalist managerialism and the sometimes literal embodiment of firms as legal and cultural entities 7.

The story of how Turner has come to serve this iconic function can help us to understand how the balance of representational power continues to shift back and forth between these two poles during a period of con siderable upheaval in the social, legal, and symbolic construction of the American business corporation.</page><page sequence="6">116 CUTHEY The personification of the corporation has been a central facet of the American social imagination since before the turn of the twenti eth century and an important American legal doctrine for almost as long. Granted, when corporate theorists talk about the personifica tion of the corporation, they most often do so in more sober terms, investigating the legal boundaries, constituencies, rights, and re sponsibilities that characterize business entities. Prevailing ideas about the duties and powers of corporate entities cause us to think of them in certain ways, so the argument goes, and these perceptions allow them to do certain things, and restrict them from doing others. But in light of the extreme rhetoric applied to business behavior be ginning in the 1980s, the notion of corporate personhood raises other questions. If the corporation is a body, then what is its gender, and what are its sexual characteristics? I want to make the case that the prevailing answers to these kinds of questions influence the way we think about corporations. The widely circulating imagery that frames corporate actors as masculine, as feminine, or even as sexual preda tors and victims, also structures expectations and creates legitimacy for certain kinds of corporate and managerial activity.9 My argument about corporate personhood rests on several as sumptions about gender and masculinity. For example, I refer to both "paternalist managerialism" and "predatory market machismo" because "masculinities" are plural rather than singular. Moreover, gendered identities are not predominantly biological, but are con structed through language, metaphors, imagery, and culturally rein forced patterns of behavior. Gendered cultural discourses define themselves in relation to each other, and masculine discourses do so not only in relation to feminine discourses, but also over and against each other. As Yvonne Due Billing and Mats Alvesson point out, it appears vital for certain forms of working-class masculinity to con struct themselves as antagonistic toward certain forms of white-col lar masculinity, and one of the most powerful ways that one mascu line discourse can distinguish itself from another is by constructing that other as non-masculine.10 Finally, the occurrence of the conflict between paternalist managerialism and predatory market machismo during a specific time period suggests that gendered cultural con structions are historically contingent and influenced by a variety of 9.

My argument also rests on certain assumptions about the cultural work performed by the personification of the corporation in the mass media, in organizational theory, and in corporate legal thought. As Gerald Davis, Krishna Diekmann, and Catherine Tinsley argue, the personification of the corporation in all of these realms builds on a tradition of naturalizing social institutions through the analogy of the "organization as body." They draw on the work of anthropologist Mary Douglas to explain that an institution is a social convention that becomes legitimized, often by means of such a "naturalizing analogy," which they define as "a parallel cognitive structure that sustains the institution by demonstrating its fit with the natural or der." These analogies, they add, "provide a source of stability for conventions by 'scripting' behavior, and they are a potent rhetorical resource for ordering social arrangements."11 However, the authors conclude, naturalizing analogies can lose their explanatory and legit imizing power over time. In fact, the very discussion appears in the context of an analysis of the deinstitutionalization of the conglomer ate form of corporate organization during the 1980s. As part of this process, they explain, a new economic theory of the corporation arose to supplant the "real entity" theory, threatening to break down the power of the "corporation as body" analogy. The hostile take overs that characterized the decade tested out these new theories in practice by means of the graphic dismemberment of actually existing corporate bodies, although the new economic theories themselves would not describe takeovers in such corporeal terms. In subsequent work, Davis and Doug McAdam have gone on to catalog the increasingly diffuse and intangible forms of corporate or ganization that have developed over the last several decades, further calling into question the continued relevance of the "organization as body" analogy. They highlight as two major aspects of this shift the decline of the mass production paradigm, along with the Fordist or ganizational forms and social structures related to it, and the bur geoning predominance of global capital markets as the primary mechanism for corporate ownership and control. Even the largest capitalist firms have begun evolving from stable organizations into fluid networks, Davis and McAdam observe. "Organization theory 11. Gerald F. Davis, Kristina A.

"This was a reason able imagery for some purposes in analyzing the organization of the post-War American economy, but the metaphors of 'sovereignty' and birth and death no longer make sense of the corporate sector."12 From this perspective, Ted Turner's iconic status as the embodi ment of a new kind of managerial identity begins to appear dated and anachronistic. In spite of his many platitudes about globaliza tion and satellite wizardry, Turner stands for a bounded vision of corporate enterprise that is becoming increasingly obsolete. Never theless, while managerialist modes of organization may be on the wane, the managerialist ideology that lionizes powerful male figures as the driving force behind the construction of bounded organiza tions continues to pervade the social construction of American busi ness enterprise. Witness the recent spate of portentous biographies of business figures such as John D. Rockefeller, Sr., and J. P. Mor gan,13 and the extent to which the federal antitrust case against Mi crosoft has hinged on the representation of the personality of Bill Gates. A "pre-millennial" issue of Time magazine devoted itself to the celebration of these and other "remarkable builders and titans who most embody capitalism and its triumphs." The magazine cited Turner as one of the "visionary entrepreneurs [who] were instrumen tal in shaping the media world of today," noting that Turner in par ticular had enlivened that world with his "buccaneering bravado."14 Barbara Czarniawska helps explain the persistence of the "corpo ration as body" analogy and, by extension, the hypermasculine rhet oric that still swirls around figures like Ted Turner. In her book, Nar rating the Organization: Dramas of Institutional Identity, she criticizes the anthropomorphic image of the organization as a "super person," because organizations are not people at all; they are "nets of collective action undertaken in an effort to shape the world and human lives." Rather than dismiss the metaphor of the "organization as super-person" altogether, she points to its continued rhetorical power as a narrative of institutional identity. That power derives, she explains, from the fact that individuality is also a modern social institution with a history, and that individual identities are narra tives that produce, reproduce, and maintain the self in conversation 12.

That is to say, the "super person" we call Ted Turner is not a person at all, but rather a conve nient narrative construction, a media legend that recounts complex phenomena in the form of a heroic tale of individual agency. Clearly, no individual has the kind of super-human agency that has been as cribed to Turner over the years. Any of the celebrated visionary achievements in the Turner legend, such as the launching of the Su perstation or the creation of Cable Network News (CNN), when ex amined closely, reveals a whole network of intersecting factors that came into play besides Turner's heroic personality and entrepre neurial zeal. As I have explained elsewhere and elaborate further here, these factors include historical, economic, and regulatory de velopments in broadcasting, cable, and satellite technology; other people's ideas, decisions, connections, and skills; and even more slippery cultural shifts beyond any individual's control.16 It is difficult to write about such a broad sense of causality in shorthand, and I acknowledge that I slip into attributing some of these kinds of developments to the individual named Ted Turner from time to time myself. I do not mean to deny the man any agency whatsoever. He certainly has exerted considerable influence over the success of his company and the shape and significance of his career. At the same time, an investigation into exactly which intentions, ac tions, and effects we can attribute to this individual, as opposed to broader historical, cultural, and economic forces, turns out to be of limited use and interest, and carries with it certain ideological con sequences. Granted, the asking of the question helps to temper ram pant hyperbole by establishing that Turner's legendary autonomous agency is largely a fiction. However, the question also tends to rein force the assumption that we must peel away the facade of media image to get to the hidden truth that constitutes the true significance of Ted Turner the individual. Such an approach tacitly prioritizes the inner over the outer and the personal over the social, thereby masking the manner in which the Turner legend exerts its powerful effect, which rests precisely on the difficulty of determining where the individual Ted Turner ends and the legend begins.

His personality is so perfectly in con fluence with the cultural representation of that personality, and with the representation of a particular shift in the personality of the Amer ican corporation in the late twentieth century, that there is little point in distinguishing between them. The narrative construction of Turner's own "super-personhood" has functioned to help reproduce and redefine the social institution of corporate personhood and iden tity during a period of significant transition, and close attention to the gendered discourse that permeates the Turner legend can help illuminate this shift. Father Knows Best: Corporate Liberal Ideals and Managerial Autonomy "One of the essential and central notions which give our industrial feudalism logical symmetry is the personification of great industrial enterprise," observed New Deal antitrust attorney and Yale Law School professor Thurman Arnold in his 1937 book, The Folklore of Capitalism. "The ideal that a great corporation is endowed with the rights and prerogatives of a free individual is as essential to the ac ceptance of corporate rule in temporal affairs as was the ideal of the divine right of kings in an earlier day." Arnold devoted a chapter of his book to lampooning the notion, already hardened into legal orthodoxy by that time, that the corporation is a person before the law, even possessed of its own distinct legal personality. "The argu ments often appeared nonsensical," he complained, "but it should be remembered that for the purpose of binding organizations together nothing makes as much sense as nonsense, and hence nonsense al ways wins."17 Law professor Morton Horwitz explored the roots of corporate personhood less sarcastically in his 1985 law review arti cle, "Santa Clara Revisited: The Development of Corporate Theory." According to Horwitz, nineteenth-century concession theories, which held that corporations existed only as artificial creations of state charter, provided too strong a basis for state regulatory inter vention to suit the interests of capital. Another nineteenth-century alternative, the aggregate theory of the firm as nothing more than a collection of individual stockholders, threatened to make those indi viduals personally liable for the corporation's actions, above and be yond the dollar amount of their initial investment. Both of these ap 17.

But the "real entity" theory of the corporation maintained that the firm was a natural "person" before the law, neither created by state fiat nor reducible to the sum of its stockholders. "The main effect of the natural entity theory of the business corporation was to legitimate large scale enterprise and to destroy any special basis for state regulation of the corporation that derived from its creation by the state," wrote Horwitz.18 Not surpris ingly, then, the real entity theory of the firm gained prominence dur ing the same period that bore witness to the rise of the mammoth managerial corporation itself. The corporation did not become a giant stalking the American landscape without considerable struggle and dissent. In the words of Allen Kaufman and Lawrence Zacharias, "the preeminent institution of the modern marketplace, the managerial corporation, has regularly incited debates over its benefits for democratic practices, the market, and liberty itself," because "modern corporate society [threatens] to reduce the individual, America's basic element of constitutional logic, to apparent sociological irrelevance."19 In essence, the problem was that such unprecedented levels of market concentration and privilege challenged an American liberal imagination predicated on the Jeffersonian ideal of a democracy of small property holders. "The quandaries created for liberal thought by the rise of the giant busi ness corporation were many, but most of them can be seen as ver sions of one central dilemma," explains sociologist Thomas Streeter. "If the legitimacy of a market society rests on its control by individu als, how can one justify a capitalism dominated by the giant imper sonal collectivities we call corporations?"20 Streeter and several other scholars have highlighted how corporate liberalism developed as a set of interrelated strategies for resolving this quandary by reconcil ing traditional liberal ideals with corporate capitalist imperatives. In this context, the real entity theory of the firm appears as a central tool in the corporate liberal arsenal—for it justified powerful capital ist collectivities in vividly individualist terms.21 18.

Managers would serve as neutral trustees situated halfway between sharehold ers and society at large, responsible for weighing the interests of both but invested with an authority all their own. Managerial expertise would ensure that shareholders received an optimal return on their investment, while managers' autonomy and social responsibility would guarantee that the staggering levels of economic power inher ent in the corporate form would not threaten the rights of individual citizens. "Indeed, it seems almost essential if the corporate system is to survive," stated Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means in their 1932 book, The Modern Corporation and Private Property, "that the 'con trol' of the great corporations should develop into a purely neutral technocracy, balancing a variety of claims by various groups in the community and assigning to each a portion of the income stream on the basis of public policy rather than private cupidity."22 Berle and Means' book has come to serve as the locus classicus of the corporate legal doctrine known as "managerialism." The central ideals of corporate liberal managerialism undergirded more than forty years of federal regulation of the broadcasting and cable industries and therefore provide the backdrop against which the emergence of a figure like Ted Turner makes sense. As Streeter argues in his book Selling the Air: A Critique of the Policy of Com mercial Broadcasting in the United States, "broadcast policy is an institutional enactment of the central corporate liberal hope and op erating assumption: that expertise can solve the dilemmas of liberal ism in a corporate consumer economy, that it can square principles of individualism, private property and a neutral rule of law with the fact of collective, bureaucratic institutions."23 Although legal doc trine long had held that the airwaves belonged to the citizens of the United States, the Radio Act of 1927 and the Communications Act of 1934 charged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with doling out access to the electromagnetic spectrum to private corpora tions. This government giveaway to business would guarantee a truly democratic broadcasting system, so the argument went, because indi vidual licensees would serve their communities as public trustees, providing programs of local concern and facilitating a broad range of local expression over the airwaves. This rationale did pave the way for a limited amount of positive state control over corporate broad casting activity—at least compared to what would come after. But it 22. Adolf A.

That managerialism buttressed massive corporate hierarchies even as it ostensibly championed individual rights is unsurprising, given its thorough-going paternalism. The corporate liberal emphasis on technocratic expertise was predicated on the belief that sturdy, autonomous management hierarchies, like fathers, knew best. "By painting the corporation as a benign mother, watched over by wise, 'fatherly' executives, financial industry leaders addressed the Gilded Age and Progressive Era's public concerns about corporate greed, un fair business practices, and extremes of wealth," observes Angel Kwolek-Folland in Engendering Business. "Ideally, if the corporation was a family, it could not also be an alien, pitiless, or evil force in American society."24 From a slightly different perspective, Streeter proposes that corporate liberal broadcasting paternalistically con structed its audience in terms analogous to those our society has used to circumscribe the social position of women, and in particular, housewives. According to Streeter, broadcasters and advertisers placed the audience on a pedestal as "something to be desired, pleased, catered to, and seduced—but not given direct power." By contrast, broadcasters and advertisers imagined themselves as "ra tional, calculating, and active individuals in the position of commu nicating to the emotional, relatively passive masses—in much the same way our culture has imagined the difference between men and women."25 These postures were not restricted to the financial and broadcast ing industries or to the United States. Allen Tullos has explored the tangled social roots of managerial paternalism in the Carolina textile industry in Habits of Industry: White Culture and the Transforma tion of the Carolina Piedmont.™ Tullos explains how mill owners and managers were able to draw upon paternalistic elements of in digenous farming, working-class, and devout Christian cultures in the Piedmont region to legitimize their own authority and promote anti-union sentiment. In their study of the financial services industry in Great Britain, Deborah Kerfoot and David Knights describe pater nalistic management within the firm as "a way of controlling em ployees through the pretense of family imagery, thus providing space 24.

" Not unlike the father in the Victorian family, man agement from this perspective appears powerful, detached, sometimes stern, yet benevolent and caring. Kerfoot and Knights note that adopt ing this paternal role "helps legitimize managerial prerogative in the eyes of both those who are 'protected' from the harsh reality of deci sion-making, and the decision makers themselves."27 Such paternalistic habits of thought also were built into the very legal concepts that buttressed the managerial corporation itself, in cluding the separation of ownership from control and the real entity theory. For example, Streeter's description of the gendered divide between broadcasters and their audience applies equally well to the way managerialism constructed the shareholder—passive, needy, and emotional, to be placed on a pedestal and pampered but not to be trusted with direct power. And as Mark McGurl has observed in his discussion of the rise of the broadcast corporation, the real entity theory's insistence on the tangible reality and sturdiness of the cor poration's existence "was a way for the corporation to lay visible claim to a privileged, indeed dominating, place on the landscape of American market culture." McGurl argues that the corporate effort to establish a tangible, masculine bodily presence even extended to the construction of the skyscraper, which he describes as "those fantas tic, phallomaniacal monuments to corporate identity." McGurl cites an architectural critic who lionized skyscrapers in the 1930s as "a natural growth, and a symbol of the American spirit. . . ruthless, tireless, assured energism, delightedly proclaiming, 'What a great boy am I!'"28 Ted Turner's Assauit on Paternalist Managerialism That quotation could just as easily serve to describe Ted Turner him self. Turner, however, would direct his own phallomaniacal energies against the towers of paternalist managerialism. Seeking to hurdle national commercial television broadcasting's formidable regulatory barriers to entry throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Turner charged that the "nitworks," as he often called them, had not lived up to their responsibilities as public trustees.

Bad, bad, bad!"29 In fact, Turner con cluded publicly and often, the network presidents were "pinkos" who were "guilty of treason" and "should be lined up and shot after a court-martial."30 Turner made such vitriolic attacks on the net works the centerpiece of his many lobbying appearances on Capitol Hill. Appearing before Congress in 1976 to argue for his right to launch the Superstation, he declared: You have to remember there are three supernetworks who only own four of five stations apiece that are controlling the way this nation thinks and raking off exorbitant profits. . . . They have an absolute, a virtual stranglehold, on what Americans see and think, and I think a lot of times they do not operate in the public good. I came into the independent television station business because I believe there should be more voices heard than the network voices out of New York, and more opportunity for program selection by the American people.31 Turner then went further to attack the foundational managerialist principle of neutral trusteeship itself in the name of technological abundance and open competition: "If I cannot do a good enough job to attract the viewers to my station in the free and open marketplace, then I do not deserve those viewers. I do not think that I should, by government regulation, be protected so people will not have any thing to watch but my station, I do not think that is fair."32 Because cable and satellite technology had solved the problem of spectrum scarcity, Turner argued, he should be under no federally imposed compunction to serve as a trustee of the public good, and Congress should abolish entry restrictions in the television industry based on public good principles and let the market hold sway. In fact, Turner maintained, the removal of those restrictions would 29. Robert Goldberg and Gerald Jay Goldberg, Citizen Turner: The Wild Rise of an American Tycoon (New York, 1995), 266. 30.

"We should be thankful that the marketplace is allowing more com petition and diversification," Turner said, holding up his Supersta tion as an example of the benefits of deregulation during Senate hear ings in 1979. "Television is becoming a consumer product. That's the big difference between what the future holds and what the net works want to keep giving us."33 None of these arguments sprang full-grown from Ted Turner's head. They floated thick in the air he had been breathing since he bought into the broadcasting industry in 1968. Turner drew together and popularized antimanagerial rhetoric voiced in many other quar ters, including the movement for corporate responsibility, the work of consumer advocates like Ralph Nader, the broadcast reform move ment, and the deregulatory struggles of Turner's own primary dis tributor, the cable industry. Rage against the managerial establish ment had become a hot cultural commodity during the 1960s, and not exclusively among hippie dropouts. In The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and Hip Consumerism, Thomas Frank makes clear that even the man in the gray flannel suit began adopting rebellious postures against "the man" during this period. "Capitalism was entering the space age in the sixties, and Organiza tion Man was a drag not only as a parent, but as an executive," Frank points out. "The values of caution, deference, and hierarchy drowned creativity and denied flexibility; they enervated not only the human spirit but the consuming spirit and the entrepreneurial spirit as well."34 A large part of Ted Turner's veneer derives from the fact that he did not just mouth these arguments; he embodied them. His personal success story, his status as a sailing hero, his Southern bravura, his cleft chin, his Rhett Butler mustache, even his fabled womanizing and the parable of his Oedipal struggles with his own overbearing father all combined to make him a natural-born hero in the assault on paternalist managerialism. In a rambling Playboy interview in 1978, for example, Turner discussed his sex life, his habit of taking pictures of nude women, and his belief that the most fun men ever have is when they get together and do "men's things" such as "con 33.

Turner explained further: In the past, war was a lot of fun. You know, rape and plunder, kill and steal. There weren't enough women to go around, because they died early, so you grabbed the other guy's women, sold his chil dren into slavery and killed the soldiers. Used to go home and have a big parade. Glorious, you know. Now war is finished. . . . It's no longer fun. The weapons are too sophisticated. It's not men leading the fleet into battle or running up the flags, you know. Back in the old days, when they didn't have professional sporting events, war was sport, like gladiators killing each other.35 In another Playboy interview in 1983 Turner made clear that he saw himself in the midst of just such a glorious martial struggle with the broadcast networks: "If I was part of CBS, with billions of dollars behind me, then I would have size. I would be able to meet the oth ers in the field with equal resources. I could fight a pitched battle with them ... I would like to come down out of the hills and meet them on the battlefields."36 Later in the same interview, Turner became so incensed over questions concerning the disparity between his reputation as a rogue womanizer and his moralizing about the evils of the networks that he flew into a rage. He trampled the interviewer's tape recorder in the aisle of an airplane and tried to flush his tapes down the toilet. Rather than detracting from his legitimacy, of course, such state ments and actions have helped cement Turner's image as "Captain Outrageous," a popular figure of raw male energy and entrepreneur ial aggression, and a walking rhetorical argument for breaking the paternalist shackles of managerial bureaucracy. "What makes me root for Turner is not his self-proclaimed virtue but his wild vitality, his unruliness," declared James Traub in his New York Times op-ed piece celebrating Turner's attempted takeover of CBS. "No force short of Turner could shock [CBS] out of its tedious complacency."37 Antimanageriaiism and the New Economic Theory of the Corporation The shift in the rhetorical construction of corporate leadership for which Ted Turner has served as an icon occurred simultaneously 35.

Starting in the 1970s, economists and legal scholars devel oped a new theory of the corporation that also sought to wield the raw energies of the market to erode the foundations of federal regula tion and topple complacent managerial hierarchies. In 1976, the year that Ted Turner's company launched the nation's first cable super station and rose to national notoriety as the scourge of the broadcast ing establishment, economists Michael Jensen and William Meckling sounded a clarion call for the new economic theory of the corpora tion with the publication of "Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behav ior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure."38 In stark contrast to the real entity theory, the new economic the ory insisted that the corporation is nothing more than a nexus of contracts, a bundle of intersecting market transactions that defies embodiment or, conveniently, regulatory containment. The new the ory professed to be egalitarian, because these supposed contracts are drawn among a variety of economic actors—managers, shareholders, employees, customers, and suppliers—all seeking to reduce their lit eral or figurative transaction costs in order to maximize outcomes. Contract theory does not even acknowledge the existence of a power imbalance that threatens individual liberties and that necessitates the corrective separation of ownership and control. The very con cepts of "ownership" and "control" lose their meaning, as does the point of insisting that corporations exist as separate, natural entities with legal standing. In the most radical form of contract theory, Judge William Allen observes, "the corporation tends to disap pear—to be transformed from a substantial institution into just a rel atively stable corner of the market in which autonomous property owners freely contract. "39 Thus the contractarian picture of the firm performed the magic trick of dissolving managerial hierarchies alto gether—at least in theory.40 According to the new economic theory, the corporation is reconceived as nothing more than a site of bustling activity, a figure of pure agency. 38.

Agency theorists are free-market economists, so they assume that all human actions are motivated by rational self-interest and utility maximization. "We define an agency relationship as a contract under which one or more persons (the principal(s)) engage another person (the agent) to perform some ser vice on their behalf which involves delegating some decision making authority to the agent," declared Jensen and Meckling.41 In plain lan guage, people with money, called principals, engage other people, called agents, to manage their money for them. But because everyone is presumably self-interested, the principals cannot be sure that their agents will watch over the money carefully enough or will refrain from skimming off the top for themselves. The value of whatever agents do manage to retain, together with the costs incurred by the principal to monitor their behavior, are called "agency costs."42 The point of the emphasis on agency costs, however, is to contrast a pic ture of the corporation predicated on structure—the managerialist picture—with a new definition of the corporation as an intense con centration of self-determining individual activity, or agency as we usually speak of it in the humanities. Agency theory dressed up the new economic picture of the corpo ration in the cloak of hard science in order to insist that it was sim ply an objective description of corporate identity. Armed with what sociologist Alan Wolfe has called this "Machiavellian realism," agency theorists and contractarians have presented themselves as the scourge of traditional managerialist doctrine. "A good deal of the rhetorical power of their writing comes from the shock value of de fending unpopular positions," noted Wolfe, "such as justifying the huge debt accumulated in the wake of LBOs or dismissing the con cerns of workers and the local community when firms move or go out of business."43 The new economic theory sanctioned these kinds of predatory corporate behavior in the name of shareholder maximi zation. The theory's real-world "agents" for increasing shareholder value were the corporate raiders and takeover artists of the 1980s. To the delight of the agency theorists, corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts toppled managerial hierarchies, broke them up into their ag gregate parts, and sold them off in chains of transactions that ren 41.

Despite the oppositional posture toward managerial hierarchies, however, corporate takeovers and the new economic theory of the firm that legitimized them ultimately promoted even greater levels of economic concentration and managerial discretion. Law professor William Bratton explained this by noting, "Treating hierarchy as if it does not exist offers wonderful support to those at the top of the hierarchy." He concluded that the picture of the firm as contract is "merely the latest in a long series of attempts to describe and justify the phenomenon of collective production in individualist terms." Although this is precisely what the ideology of corporate liberalism and the real entity theory sought to do, it would be a mistake to conclude that contract theory is therefore corporate liberal. Modeling all corporate activity on predatory market transactions rather than on familial relationships, it shares none of the paternalistic charac teristics of corporate liberalism. More fundamentally, contract theory refuses to cede the very existence of the central problem that gave rise to corporate liberal ideology in the first place—the collective corporate threat to the unfettered agency of the liberal individual. "Since no cognizable corporate collectivity appears amidst the nexus of contracts," wrote Bratton, "no tension arises between collective and individual interests."44 This is because contract theory rests on a radically atomistic brand of individualism that reverses the tradi tional liberal view of the market as the arena where individuals come to exercise their liberty. "Early liberals viewed the market, individu alism, and voluntary choice as empowering mechanisms that would strengthen people's character," explained Alan Wolfe. "Contempo rary economic writers view individuals as empowering the market to work in more efficient and productive ways, even at the risk of disempowering the capacities of the people who act in the market."45 In spite of its realist pretensions, the new economic theory of the firm turns out to be stridently normative—it argues that the corpora tion should be considered a meeting place for freely contracting indi viduals, and that actually existing legal and regulatory precedents to the contrary should be abolished. But as pure description, the new economic theory fails even to render an accurate picture of its own cast of characters, who are far from the freely contracting agents the theory describes. "In fact, such people do not actually make deci sions; the economic advantages or disadvantages of their actions make the decisions for them," Wolfe concluded. "The people in 44. Bratton, "The New Economic Theory of the Firm," 1499. 45. Wolfe, "The Modern Corporation," 1685.</page><page sequence="21">Ted Turner and Images of American Business Leadership 131 volved in this process give up their responsibility to the economic calculus."46 Ted Turner has functioned as a transitional figure between these two poles—between corporate liberalism, paternalist managerialism, and the real entity theory of the firm on the one hand, and atomistic neoliberalism, predatory market adventurism, and the new economic theories of the firm on the other. With his diatribes against the evils of large corporations and his comparisons of the network presidents to Hitler, Turner certainly acknowledges the corporate threat to lib eral individualism. However, he fundamentally alters the corporate liberal solution to the problem. His symbolic effect has been to sup plant the bureaucratic rationality of corporate liberalism with market efficiencies, its technical expertise with an "aw-shucks" enthusiasm for satellite gadgetry, and its paternalistic trusteeship with the vir tues of youthful and regenerative entrepreneurship. In this regard, he embodies the market exuberance that we associate with the new economic theory of the firm, and this is why he has never legitimized corporate media management in the top-down, paternalistic mode of a Thomas Edison, a David Sarnoff, or a William Paley. No matter how gray-haired Turner gets, he maintains a youthful, rebellious, se ductive, and boyish aura of naïveté and acquisitiveness. Turner does not dispense with the conception of the corporation as a person alto gether, however. Rather than separate ownership from control, or do away with both, Turner recombines both ownership and control in his own person, presenting himself as a new, tangible, antibureau cratic and competitive-masculine embodiment of corporate leader ship and responsibility. Turner's 1997 pledge to donate a billion dollars to the United Na tions further cemented his status as a living symbol of the persistent back-and-forth between these competing conceptions of corporate identity, managerial responsibility, and the proper means of redis tributing wealth. Many news accounts wrapped Turner's move in some variation of the by-now familiar masculine tropes—in its own news flash, CNN called him the "the d'Artagnan of the Three Muske teers of charitable giving," and the cover of Philanthropy magazine portrayed him as a wild-eyed cowboy riding astride the globe, whip ping it on with a UN flag.47 Other pundits asserted that Turner had "thrown down the gauntlet," challenging other billionaires and cor porate figureheads such as Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch to follow his example. The gift was certainly a testament to Turner's belief that 46. Ibid., 1679, 1685. 47. Joie Chen and Larry King, "Ted Turner Giving Away $1 Billion to the United Nations," CNN Breaking News (18 Sept. 1997; 10:30 PM ET).</page><page sequence="22">132 CUTHEY business should be socially responsible on a global scale, and thus it implicitly endorsed a managerialist picture of the firm as an entity with public duties and obligations. The gift was also a private, vol untary decision, which Turner was under no legal or regulatory obli gation to make. Turner's largesse had been made possible, moreover, by the fact that the value of his own shares in Time Warner had become so staggeringly large because federal regulators no longer frowned on such powerful combinations as a threat to liberal democ racy. From this perspective, Turner's action championed the natural legitimacy, dynamic creativity, and trickle-down social responsibil ity of the untrammeled marketplace and the imperative for share holder maximization. Turner thus inhabits a contradictory ideological position, which we might best label "corporate neoliberalism." During the 1970s and 1980s, he paradoxically embodied the antimanagerial assault on the corporate body. Then in 1995, he announced his company's merger with Time Warner Inc., which only six years earlier had become the most visible corporate symbol of paternalist managerialism in a landmark legal decision endorsing the real entity theory of the cor poration, Paramount Communications Inc. v. Time Inc. The contra dictions produced by the Turner/Time Warner merger did not go un noticed. Turner Broadcasting's union with Time Warner became conflated in the media with Turner's own romance with Jane Fonda, precisely because both appeared to threaten Turner's legendary sex ual and entrepreneurial potency. Ted Turner and Time-Fonda: Media Romance and Corporate Family Drama In October 1990, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda appeared together on CNN's Larry King Live to promote her latest fitness video, "Jane Fon da's Lean Routine." King gushed and giggled about how Jane was just a "regular girl" and Ted a romantic guy who remembered "little things." He also pressed the couple about rumors that they planned to marry, although they answered with a teasing "no comment." Theirs was not the only media marriage prefigured in the moment, however. Warner Home Video was the sole distributor for the Fonda aerobics empire. Time Warner Inc. at that time owned 20 percent of the Turner Broadcasting System. During the interview, King also asked about rumors that Time Warner might purchase the rest of Turner's company. Turner and Fonda would tie the knot within the year; the two corporations would not fully consummate their union for another six. Still, both marriages were already taking place in a</page><page sequence="23">Ted Turner and Images of American Business Leadership 133 simultaneous and symbolic sense on the screen. At the end of the interview, Turner's son Rhett called from Tokyo, where he was working as a CNN cameraman, in an awkwardly orchestrated oppor tunity for Larry King to conclude by beaming "It's all in the family! "48 At the press conference announcing the proposed sale of Turner Broadcasting five years later, Turner nodded his approval when Time Warner chair Gerald Levin likewise stressed, "We've always been family." Exactly what he meant became clear later that night when Levin and Turner also appeared on the Larry King show, and Levin revealed, "We've known each other for more than 20 years, and I would have to say during that period, probably three or four times, Ted has proposed marriage."49 Meanwhile the press wrapped the deal between their respective companies in familial, conjugal— even sexual—imagery. "After weeks in a long, slow dance together," ABC Nightly News reported, "today they made it to the altar of the joint press conference."50 Many Turner enthusiasts reacted to both wedding announcements with identical shock and horror. "There was a real undercurrent of betrayal," a Turner associate said in Vanity Fair of the engagement to "Hanoi Jane." "How could he do this? Ted, the great embodiment of the American capitalist system, how could he marry her?"51 Con servative columnist Dick Williams likewise demanded "Say it ain't so!" in an op-ed letter addressed to Turner in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution after the announcement of the Time Warner deal. "Say you aren't selling out and succumbing to the suits at Rockefel ler Center. . . . You're about to become the problem you've railed about through most of your career." Williams went on: The beauty of Turner Broadcasting has been that it wasn't part of the herd. Even Turner Entertainment cooks up its wonders here, in the real United States, far from the face-lifted and liposucked phonies of Hollywood. . . . It's probably true that your empire had to get bigger or die. And you have been handicapped by Time War ner's presence on your board. After they bailed you out, it must 48.

But you've always been the type to beat them, not join them.52 Turner would offer one response to both complaints. "How could somebody who's been his own boss go and work for somebody else after 35 years?" he asked in a talk to a collection of media executives in the midst of the merger negotiations. "Well, when I married Jane Fonda, I mean, I was taking a real risk there, too. Cause she's got a lot of ideas, and she doesn't exactly toe the party line, you know." After mimicking his own pliant acquiescence to Fonda's many de mands, Turner concluded, "If I can do that I can probably live with the executives of Time Warner. At least they let me go home at night, and I get a few hours a day when I'm free and I can do whatever I want."53 As in the bedroom, so in the boardroom. Turner's analogy capital ized on the popular perception that both new partners posed a threat to his much-fabled manhood. His new wife did so largely because of her past iconic associations with the two arch enemies of American macho autonomy, feminism and Communist-sympathizing radical ism, both of which raised the specter of entanglement, encroach ment, and collective constraint on individual masculine agency. At the same time, aspects of Fonda's own celebrity aura—her outspoken self-assertiveness and financial independence, the fact that she is the same age as Turner, and her iconographically sexualized, aerobic ized, and mass-marketed "hardbody"—all challenged Turner's status as the very model of individual agency and corporate virility. For the maintenance of the Turner legend, it became crucial for the media to highlight the way Fonda had sacrificed her own independence for the sake of the man she called her "buccaneer." She became the ulti mate corporate trophy wife, who by all accounts had "wrapped her self body and soul in her new incarnation as Mrs. Ted Turner."54 As she admitted in one televised interview, "I can't imagine any movie that I ever made or could make in the future that. . . would be worth giving up the three months of being with Ted."55 Fonda also became a vehicle for the 60-year-old Turner to reassert his sexual prowess. Newsweek reported in 1996 that Turner had blurted out during a phone conversation with a Time Warner executive that he had to go make love to his wife.50 And during a gathering of board members at 52.

As recently as 1994, when Time Warner kept him from making a bid for NBC, Turner had charged in a highly publicized speech before the National Press Club that his major shareholder was cynically holding him back so it could go out and buy a network for itself. "Unfortunately, I haven't been around as long as Time Warner and I don't go back 75 years and had lots of time in previous generations to build up a huge amount of capital for me to inherit and move forward with," Turner com plained. "I had to do almost all of it myself." Turner then recalled a CNN report on female genital mutilation in northern Africa, inflicted so the young women "can't have fun in sex." Turner went on to ex plain that he took the story very personally because, in a like man ner, Time Warner was effectively feminizing and emasculating him. "Well, I'm in an angry mood. I'm angry at that too. I'm being sutur ized [sic] by Time Warner, and the women are being suturized. . . . That's exactly right, and I don't like it any more than they do. . .. "58 When Turner announced in 1995 that he would merge his com pany with the same corporate bully he had accused of genital mutila tion just one year earlier, news reports resurrected his remarkable words in order to muse publicly about whether Turner's new boss would allow him to have fun in business anymore either. Time mag azine's own article on the consummation of the merger acknowl edged the potential family tensions, referring to Gerald Levin as the "unsteady father" and to Turner as the "unruly son." However, the article carried the headline "A Marriage Is Blessed," and it worked hard to convey an image of corporate domestic bliss that would keep Turner happy and strengthen rather than stifle his energies.59 Other media industry watchers expressed their belief that Turner would shock Time Warner out of its complacency with a much-needed dose of entrepreneurial spirit. A Wall Street Journal article published after the completion of the merger demonstrates how the perception that Turner would rejuvenate Time Warner hinged rhetorically on the re affirmation of his hypermasculinity and aggressive energy. "A lot of people expected Mr. Turner would ride off into the sunset after he sold his Turner Broadcasting System Inc. to Time Warner," the Jour nal said, invoking again the image of Turner as the consummate cor 57.

"Instead, he is off on a wild ride through the world's biggest media empire, crashing into top executives' personal fief doms, abruptly canceling deals, asking impertinent questions about lavish expenses, and generally giving Time Warner a one-man dose of culture shock."60 Five years later, however, Turner's figurative power was on the wane, even as his wealth increased. On January 4, 2000, Turner and Fonda released a joint statement announcing their decision to sepa rate after eight years of marriage. Exactly one week later, Turner took to the podium along with Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin and America On Line (AOL) founder Steve Case to announce their inten tion to create the largest media conglomerate in the world. During the news conference that followed, Turner declared, "Signing the piece of paper that voted my shares was as exciting or more exciting than the first time I made love 42 years ago."61 It seemed somehow fitting that Turner's marriage to Fonda dissolved at almost exactly the same moment that the AOL merger turned his marital arrange ment with Time Warner upside down. Once again, his "private" life had served up an apt metaphor for his public financial dealings. Turner had been released from his ties to Fonda so that he could play the field as he used to, only to tie himself down again almost immediately. And it was not surprising that Turner chose to describe the new merger by talking once again about his own sex life. Never theless, there was something almost poignant about Turner's exact choice of words. By harkening back to his first sexual encounter forty years ago, the 61-year-old Turner dated himself—Steve Case is only 41—and confirmed that when the business press celebrated the merger as the marriage of old media and new media, Turner defi nitely represented the old. He was just a third wheel in this new marital arrangement, anyway: all the steamy descriptions of corpo rate romance in the press centered on Case and Levin. "Case and Levin began their mating dance at a meeting of the Global Business Dialogue in Paris last September," reported Time magazine. "Two weeks later they continued their global flirtation at a lavish Fortune Magazine event."62 Similarly, the task of personifying corporate identity in the new economy passed to the boyish and soft-spoken former Pizza Hut 60.

The sometimes contradictory, sometimes mutually reinforcing mas culine tropes and gendered themes that Turner held together with such panache will continue to structure debates over the proper role of the corporation, although they likely will be championed by less charismatic icons, many of them with more human-sized egos. In an article in Fortune just after the merger announcement, for example, Case painted himself as an "attacker" who would capitalize aggres sively on the fact that AOL would become the Internet gatekeeper to twenty-one million homes worldwide. However, in the Wall Street Journal just a few days later, he sought to temper such predatory statements with a dose of good old-fashioned managerialism. "I now have a job that clearly has to take in mind the public interest," said Case. "It's a new world for us in many ways."63 Conclusion: Corporate Schizophrenia The new economic theory of the firm and the corporate takeovers that tested the theory in practice sought to replace the "corporation as body" analogy with a new naturalizing analogy, one predicated on the burgeoning belief that market activity is a natural and universal phenomenon. The new analogy pictured the corporation as a mere cluster of competitive market transactions, a "nexus of contracts." Contractarians argue that the managerialist picture of the corporation and the entire edifice of rights and duties attached to that picture were all in error. Managers' only duties should be to maximize share holder value, they insist, not to serve as trustees of the public interest or as guardians of an autonomous corporate entity. According to this view, federal regulations and legal restrictions governing corporate activity based on the managerialist entity conception are unnatural, inefficient, and even morally indefensible, and they should be scrapped so that the market can return to its pure and natural state. Theories of the corporation based on the "natural market" analogy have gained widespread currency, particularly in neoconservative academic circles, but they have not succeeded in eclipsing the mana gerialist real entity theory completely. In his decision in the Delaware Court of Chancery case Paramount Communications Inc. v. Time Incorporated, for example, Chancellor William T. Allen ruled that Time's board did not breach its legal and fiduciary duties to its shareholders in 1989 when it rejected a lucra 63. Martin Peers, et al., "Media Blitz: AOL, Time Warner Leap Borders to Plan a Mammoth Merger," Wall Street Journal, 11 Jan. 2000, Al.</page><page sequence="28">138 CUTHEY tive but uninvited tender offer from Paramount in order to pursue its own purchase of Warner Communications, a deal that resulted in the creation of Time Warner. "The financial vitality of the corporation and the value of the company's shares is in the hands of the directors and managers of the firm," Allen declared. "The corporation law does not operate on the theory that directors, in exercising their pow ers to manage the firm, are obligated to follow the wishes of a major ity of shares. In fact, directors, not shareholders, are charged with the duty to manage the firm."64 In his ruling, Allen gave credence to arguments by Time Warner's lawyers that Paramount's tender offer posed a threat to the distinctive corporate culture that Time's man agement had cultivated and protected as responsible trustees for most of the twentieth century. Along with a series of state constitu ency statutes passed toward the end of the 1980s, Allen's opinion in the Time case, upheld on appeal by the Delaware Supreme Court, amounted to a sweeping judicial reaffirmation of the separa tion of ownership from control, the autonomous trustee function of corporate management, and the real entity conception of the corpora tion.65 Nevertheless, in a 1994 article entitled "Our Schizophrenic Con ception of the Business Corporation," Allen himself acknowledged that his own endorsement of the entity concept had not resolved the debate over corporate identity and managerial duties. "Indeed, while the law seems to have ringingly endorsed a managerialist or entity orientation, full-bodied statements of the managerialist philosophy appear now to be rather out of fashion, even among members of se nior corporate management," he observed. "Today the talk is more likely to be about creating shareholder value than about social re sponsibility." Allen concluded that the two competing visions of corporate identity described in this article have come to coexist in an uneasy and sometimes paradoxical tension. He notes that the fun damental distinction between the two hinges on the question of whether they are public institutions or private property, but he ar gues that corporations are too complex for this question ever to be resolved. "Within them exists the tension that a dynamic market sys tem creates," wrote Allen, "between the desire to achieve increases in total wealth and the desire to avoid the losses and injuries—the redistribution—-that a dynamic system inevitably engenders."66 64.

Allen, "Our Schizophrenic Conception of the Business Corporation," 481.</page><page sequence="29">Ted Turner and Images of American Business Leadership 139 I have sought to show how Ted Turner has come to serve as the naturalizing analogy for the dynamic tension, or perhaps schizophre nia, over corporate identity that Allen described. As the rhetoric wrapped around his takeover bid for CBS demonstrates, Turner came to serve early in his career as a convenient and highly visible symbol of natural market energies and antimanagerial aggression. But such takeover attempts became legitimized in the public eye by means of tropes and imagery still very much connected to bodies, sexual ac tivity, and even rape, and Turner paradoxically embodied the un leashing of market forces against the very idea of the corporation as body. When Turner folded his company into Time Warner in 1995, moreover, the paragon of entrepreneurial aggression and antimana gerial rebellion joined forces with the corporation that had become the premiere symbol of autonomous managerial power and trustee ship in the judicial ruling upholding the entity view of the corpora tion. In the media and even in statements made by Turner himself, his conjugal union with Jane Fonda came to serve as the naturalizing analogy that helped police the conceptual and ideological contra dictions created by the financial union of Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner. Because Turner himself had made clear that Time Warner threatened to emasculate and feminize him—as many feared Fonda would also—the reassertion of his legendary masculinity be came a condition for the legitimacy of both mergers. As if motivated by a need to ensure that Turner would not become engulfed by the corporate giant Time Warner, business rhetoric and the commer cial media continued to portray him in hypermasculine terms as America's favorite "cowboy capitalist." With the help of such imag ery and language, Turner enacted the symbolic insertion of competi tive and disruptive market energies, individual entrepreneurial agency, and even male sexual potency into the large managerialist organization itself. In this manner, his rhetorical effect trades on his pseudo-populist and quasi-Oedipal challenge to the power and con trol of the corporate father figure in order to legitimize that control on new terms. That Ted Turner's personal life has come to serve as a prism re fracting these tensions highlights the fundamental issue in the de bate between managerialist and contractarian definitions of the cor poration—is the corporation a public institution or a piece of private property? "The process of drawing the line between private and pub lic is neither natural nor automatic," observed Alan Wolfe. "The line is drawn differently in different times and different places, and law, including corporate law, is one of the major mechanisms by which</page><page sequence="30">140 CUTHEY it is drawn."67 In this article, I have made the case that the gendered cultural framing of corporate activity in business rhetoric and the popular media also functions as a mechanism for fixing and shifting the line between the public and the private with respect to market activity. I have argued that an investigation of Ted Turner's media legend helps illuminate this process, because the persistent confu sion and debate over corporate identity is built into the form of the Turner legend itself, which blurs Turner's own actions and the ac tions of his company with broader economic and historical develop ments beyond any individual's or company's control. Turner's rhe torical effect is to collapse the private with the public, the individual with the corporate, and predatory market adventurism with paternal ist managerialism in such a way that his personal biography serves as a public drama about the shifting ways that corporate capital has come to represent and legitimize itself during a period of significant conflict over the social and legal construction of corporate activity and identity. 67.
