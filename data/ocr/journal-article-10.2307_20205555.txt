Even before 1511, when the Portuguese established a commercial post at Malacca, patola were exported to the islands in great numbers. In contrast to the patola used in India, those for the Indonesian market were smaller and less densely woven, with gilt-metal weft threads that were limited to a narrow line at both ends. Since patola were extremely expensive, ownership was restricted to people of noble rank. They were worn as clothing at central Opposite: Detail of Sarong fSarong limar), cat. 22. Javanese courts, among other places, but their ceremonial role was much more important. The patolu shown above is ornamented with the Indian basket design known as chhabadi bhat, which consists of roundels containing eight-pointed stars made of flowers. Although this example has a red background, purple and yellow versions are not unusual.1 An intensely popular pattern, chhabadi bhat has been copied in ceremonial textiles throughout Indonesia?in Javanese batik, Balinese weft ikat, warp ikat from Flores and Roti, and bridewealth sarongs from Lembata, to mention just a few.2 In some instances weavers followed the design quite closely, and in others they adopted merely a fragment. Over the centuries, patola patterns took on the special role of symbolizing the wearer's aristocratic identity and affiliation. Very often, even indigenous textiles that displayed adaptations of patola designs were limited to noble families.3 In recent years, scholars have discovered several previously unknown patterns.4 It is likely that quite a number of patolu types have disappeared, although vestiges may remain in some of the Indonesian ceremonial textiles they inspired.5 29</page><page sequence="3">3 2 Patolu India, Gujarat 18th/19th century Silk and gilt-metal-strip-wrapped (probably bast) fiber, stripes of plain weave and stripes of warp and weft resist dyed, double ikat, plain weave with main warp fringe; 102 x 407 cm (40 Vs xi663A in.) 2002.905 This impressive patolu, with its row of four tall elephants, displays a rare design variation: the background changes from black to red in the center field. This may indicate that the textile was specially produced for export, since in India black was associated with death and considered inauspicious if used in other contexts.1 Contrary to most patola designs, which are abstract, this one depicts an actual scene, possibly a royal hunt. Here, each elephant bears a howdah, or covered pavilion, with two passengers inside; in front sits a guide wielding the ankush, a sharply pointed tool used to control the beast. Smaller figures abound, among them goats, parakeets, peacocks, tigers, and men riding camels and horses. Charming as it is, this design does not seem to have been incorporated into the repertoire of Indonesian patola imitations, since no related examples are known. 3 Woman's Ceremonial Skirt (tapis) South Sumatra, Lampung area, Paminggir people 18th century (?) Five panels joined: three panels of stripes of silk and cotton, warp resist dyed, warp ikat, plain weave with paired warps, strips of warp-faced, 30 weft-ribbed plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts and one stripe of cotton, plain weave; embroidered with silk in back, double running, stem, and surface satin stitches and two panels of cotton, plain weave; embroidered with silk in back, stem, and surface satin stitches; 138.6 x 121.8 cm (54 Vi x 47 7/8 in.) 2002.911 The Lampung district in South Sumatra is an area especially rich in textile art. Influences from India, mainland Southeast Asia, and the neighboring island of Java have left marks that are quite visible at some times yet shrouded in mystery at others. Over several centuries, a deeply stratified society evolved in the region due to the lucrative pepper trade. One of the major ethnic groups was the Paminggir, who lived along the southern coast, up the western coast, and near Lake Ranau in the interior. Theirs was a highly hierarchical culture in which rank, acquired by wealth, was the primary marker of status within the community. Textiles were especially created to be worn at ceremonies and festivities, and it may be assumed that they were used to display the owner's social standing. This ceremonial skirt, known as a tapis, belongs to a small group of outstanding pieces that became known to scholars only in the 1980s. Called "red tapis" in reference to the dominant color of their ikat patterns, they are distinguished by their unique combination of material and technique, their high level of craftsmanship, and their artistic design. They all seem to have been made in a single place within the Paminggir area, although where exactly is not known.1 Five panels were joined together to create the material for this skirt. Broad, silk warp ikat bands alternate with embroidered panels on which strands of white, untwisted silk are worked in satin and running stitches on a ground of dark blue cotton fabric. Narrow bundles of warp stripes in</page><page sequence="4">3 dark blue, orange, and red act as framing devices and are accentuated by minute, stepped zigzag lines stitched with thin orange thread. The broad ikat stripes display a sequence of two alter nating honeycomb and hook patterns. The coloring is rich: besides the natural off-white, there is a warm red and glimpses of blue and bluish black, which is created by over dyeing red with indigo. The narrow, framing ikat stripes have a more severe palette, which is restricted to black, off-white, and red. While warp ikat is normally made with cotton in Indonesia, in the case of red tapis it is fashioned from silk. The patterns of red tapis often imitate patola, the prized silk double ikat textiles from India, but there are no designs comparable to this one in the Indian repertoire. As is typical for works such as this, the embroidered bands were worked separately and assembled afterward. The meaning of the motifs in the two broad bands is unclear, although some images of ships with curling prows can be identified (see detail, p. 8). Minute running stitches fill the background like silver mist, bearing testimony to the embroiderer's skill. In contrast to these densely ornamented panels, that in the middle is worked in a less crowded style. 31</page><page sequence="5">*'#?-. -. ^ra^? It may be that its primary decoration, a snakelike creeper with a repetitive, asymmetrical flower, was created by a different hand. The precious silk and three-colored ikat fabric of this tapis, together with its elegant design, announces the high status of the wearer. Used only during important ceremonies, it would have proclaimed her wealth, nobility, and sophistication. Dating the garment is a difficult matter, since only recently have scholars become aware that some of Indonesia's precious heirloom textiles date as far back as the seventeenth or even the fifteenth century.2 Because they were worn only occasionally and then stored away from light and insects, they could certainly have survived for many years. 32 4 Woman's Ceremonial Skirt (tapis) South Sumatra, Lampung, Paminggir people 19th century Two panels joined: stripes of cotton, warp resist dyed, warp ikat, plain weave with paired warps; cotton and silk, plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts; and stripes of cotton, plain weave embroidered with silk and gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip wrapped silk in back, chain, stem, and surface satin stitches; laidwork and couching; 145.7 x 128.7 cm (57 3/s x 50 Vs in.) 2002.913</page><page sequence="6">This tapis is one of a well-known group of works from the Paminggir area that are characterized by dark and light brown warp ikat bands interspersed with two wide, embroidered panels on the sides and a narrow one in the middle.1 The piece is exceptional for its twelve ikat bands, since only four are typically found. While this feature may be a local variation, early collectors of such textiles seldom recorded exact provenance information, so it is impossible to connect certain types of tapis with distinct locales. The textile, which comprises two panels, has been cut open. It was formerly a tubular garment that would have been worn with a pleat in the front and secured with a broad belt. The weaving material is handspun cotton. Where ikat pattering appears, the warp threads are paired, a typical phenomenon with cotton ikat in the Lampung districts. Since the threads are rather thin, this technique slightly enlarges the pattern. The same line of nine different images appears in each row, a sequence that is mirrored along the narrow, embroidered band in the center. Although these motifs are quite distinctive because of their highly abstract design and hooked extensions, they are difficult to read. The precise, repetitive pattern makes for a static appearance that benefits from the presence of the embroidered panels. Both the coloring and the intricate warp ikat ornamentation somewhat resemble that of some very rare ceremonial textiles from the Komering area of South Sumatra, which date to the fifteenth or sixteenth century.2 Figure i. Detail of cat. 4, showing a motif that may represent a spirit. The needlework appears on a foundation of dark blue cotton warp stripes. The white needlework, done in untwisted silk, is accentuated by blue, orange, and red lines and dots. The ornamentation, which is the same in both bands, consists of a sequence of anthropomorphic beings clearly defined as male and female, together with amorphous shapes that some scholars believe represent spirits (see fig. i).3 These motifs are found frequently on brown ikat tapis such as this; other examples display rows of ships or dwellings. According to researchers, a young man presented the girl of his choice with the design, and she embroidered it onto her tapis.* 5 Ceremonial Hanging (palepai) South Sumatra, Lampung area, Kalianda, Paminggir people 19th century Cotton, silk, and silver-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped bast fiber (probably ramie), plain weave with supplementary patterning and brocading wefts, main warp fringe; 290.2 x 66 cm (114 'Ax 26 in.) 2002.914 The Paminggir aristocracy employed a type of ritual hanging commonly known as a ship cloth, a name that refers to one of its principal motifs. The indigenous name, palepai, probably goes back to the old Javanese word lepib, which means "to fold" or "to double." These hangings display a very limited repertoire of patterns, which includes one or two red ships, a single blue ship, tree images (see cat. 6), buildings, and rows of stylized anthropomorphic figures.1 Weavers would have made these works on a backstrap loom with a comb, which kept the warp threads slightly apart, allowing the weft threads to be visible as well. The motifs were created with supplementary wefts, which floated on the surface of the undyed cotton weave. Some parts of these elements could be rendered in silk with additional highlights in gilt-metal threads or foil. The patterns were worked with the help of pattern sticks, which were inserted into the back part of the warp threads and used to program the motif. Weaving these ceremonial textiles was a prerogative of the noblewomen of the village. The two red ships are almost alike with their multiple, arching prows, and the design of each is placed symmetrically on either side of a vertical axis. Both turmeric yellow and a slightly faded morinda red appear prominently in the supplementary wefts. Two animals, their heads bent down, confront each other inside an enclosure on the ship's upper 33</page><page sequence="7">3 deck. They are framed by elongated, shadow-puppet-like figures who stand next to a person placed on an animal or some sort of conveyance. Underneath is a row of stylized figures in a distinct headgear that recalls the bifurcated design of the siger, the golden, ceremonial headdress of unmarried girls. The ship's bottom edge was once embellished by a strip of metal foil, now almost completely gone beneath the fastening stitches. Two little lifeboats accompany the big ship. The background is crowded with tiny blue crosses, a stylistic trait that suggests the horror vacui that can also be found on the embroidered bands of some types of tapis, the ceremonial skirts worn by aristocratic Paminggir women (see cats. 3-4). Palepai served as markers of status and perhaps even denoted descent. In a village, each lineage was assigned a greater or lesser rank in the social hierarchy. At formal gatherings of village heads, this was symbolized by aligning the palepai accordingly on the walls of the meeting hall. The palepai of local clan chiefs or district rulers were inherited by the eldest sons. Title, claim to leadership, and certain other privileges accompanied possession of the palepai. These textiles were important requisites during rites of passage such as marriage, death, or accession to a higher rank?events that were thought to be unstable moments fraught with danger, times at which people were in need of special protection. During ceremonies, the palepai belonging to the main participant or his family was hung behind him on the wall of the village congregation hall. The ship image, 34 functioning as a sort of spiritual lifeboat, was an appropriate agent of safe conduct from one stage of life to another. Yet this is by no means the only meaning of this motif. The red vessels are also understood to represent the upper world, the abode of the ancestors, which is reached by the ship of death. The ancestors' presence demonstrated the close ties that included deceased family members and put the living under the protection of the dead.2 Since the Lampung economy was based on sea trade, ships became symbols of wealth and power as well. In 1883 the volcano Krakatoa erupted, and thousands of people died on the southern coast of Sumatra. Textiles were destroyed as well, and the production oipalepai never truly recovered. By the beginning of the twentieth century they were no longer being manufactured, although those that remained were used in ceremonies as late as the 1970s. Since palepai fetch very high prices on the art market, new pieces have appeared since the 1980s that follow old examples rather closely.3</page><page sequence="8">3 6 Ceremonial Hanging (palepai) South Sumatra, Lampung area, Paminggir people c. 1900 Cotton, silk, and silver-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped bast fiber (probably ramie), plain weave with supplementary patterning and brocading wefts, main warp fringe; 220 x 68.8 cm (86 Vs x 25 78 in.) 2002.919 This palepai depicts a sequence of stylized trees. The overall composition of this early-twentieth-century piece no longer conforms to the traditional palepai layout, which would have included some narrow designs separating the patterned panels.1 Some elements, including the small animal forms between the branches, are hardly recognizable, since they are represented standing on end rather than horizontally. There are many mistakes in the weaving of the border design, which displays mismatching lines. It appears as though this piece was woven at the end of the production period in Lampung. ?

While there are not many examples of this motif on tampan in museum collections, those that are published display a set pattern closely resembling the one seen here. The direction of the weaving and the juxtaposition of the patterns clearly demonstrate that this piece started out as a succession of tampan panels, woven one after the other on long warp threads. Owing to the use of pattern sticks, which were inserted into the warp threads in reverse order after each use, the images were repeated upside down. Why they were cut and joined to form this longitudinal arrangement is uncertain. Formerly, this textile must have been framed by some sort of border; that it was removed only recently is demonstrated by the clean areas visible along the selvages. 36 8 Ceremonial Cloth (tampan) South Sumatra, Lampung area, Lampung Bay, Paminggir people Mid-19th century Cotton, plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts; 70.3 x 71 cm (27 78 x 28 in.) 2002.1003 In addition to large palepai, weavers in the Lampung area produced another square ceremonial textile, the tampan, which comprises two distinct categories. Tampan pasisir contain complex scenes that seem to narrate a story or illustrate a specific event. Restricted to the aristocracy, these were only found along the region's south coast. Tampan darat, in contrast, were patterned with more abstract, angular designs and were used throughout Lampung by every segment of the population. Of the tampan pasisir type, this piece features an elon gated boat whose superstructures are filled with people. While flags, streaming banners, and umbrellas are clearly used to designate distinguished passengers, the scene within the central enclosure eludes interpretation. There exist tampan very similar to this one that are easier to interpret, since their visual vocabulary is more recognizable.1 Tampan served a multitude of purposes in rites of passage: brides sat on them, circumcisions were performed on them, the head of a deceased person rested on them during the ritual washing, and they covered the main roof timber and corner beams of a house under construction.</page><page sequence="10">?w ' -, tip,_XB?Km , J^k.*^ i?"5f *?.^Bk WfiW1! V?J?X. I I H-vtv Hvlv^ ^V BB^ I CSl^Brl . Moreover, no ritual gift exchange could take place without them: they were used to wrap gifts and cover food, and their transfer helped seal alliances. There is evidence of local variations in color combination, border design, spatial arrangement, and the use of special motifs.2 Comparing the many published tampan makes it possible to discern degrees of quality regarding craftsmanship and understanding of the motifs. Here, the weaver rendered the scenic details in a rather reduced manner, making it difficult to identify individual objects. It is possible that, for whatever reason, she was unable to remain in full control of the representation. 37</page><page sequence="11">mmmmmmmm 9-1 o Ceremonial Skirts (tapis) South Sumatra, Lampung area, Abung people 20th century 2005.458: cotton, warp-faced plain weave, embroidered with gilt metal-strip-wrapped cotton in laidwork and couching; embellished with sequins; 110.5 x 119.4 cm (43 Vi x 47 in.); 2005.460: cotton and silk warp-faced plain weave embroidered with gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton in laidwork and couching; 107.6 x 131.3 cm (42 V8 x 51 7i6in.) The Abung, another of Lampung's ethnic groups, live northeast of the Paminggir. Over the centuries, they developed a deeply stratified society due to the highly profitable trade in pepper. They, too, had created a culture rich in elaborate ceremonies, some of which marked life transitions such as birth, circumcision, marriage, or death, while others denoted a nobleman's elevation to a higher level in the aristocratic 38 hierarchy (see fig. i). These lavish events were the chief occasions on which to display wealth and acquire prestige. The long, tubular tapis, donned by Abung noblewomen on festive occasions, is an ostentatious marker of the prosperity and status of the wearer's kin. A special technique is used to adorn a tapis manufactured for the glory of a noble family. In this process, imported gilt-metal threads are couched densely on the fabric, held in place by small fastening stitches that imitate a twill weave. The play of light on the gilt surface gives a shimmering effect to the geometric ornaments, which include rectangles, stars, and triangles. Such heavy decoration needs to be supported by a sturdy ground. Since some parts of the fabric are not visible at all, as they are completely covered by gilt thread, the warp can be made with heavy, handspun cotton. Other areas, which are meant to provide a contrasting backdrop, display bold stripes in brown, orange, or dull red silk. Aiming for a strong visual impact from afar rather than the pleasures of close, intimate inspection, the Abung took a different stylistic and</page><page sequence="12">3 figure i.

It was not only the display of gold but also her ability to incorporate imported materials such as gilt thread and different fabrics that earned the wearer prestige. As she readied herself, she would have secured her stiff, glittering tapis with a broad belt that was often made of imported velvet and adorned with metal buckles. She also would have taken a shoulder cloth?either of a gilt brocaded fabric from Palembang or an Indian cotton trade textile from the Coromandel Coast?and folded it into a narrow sash, passing it over her shoulders and across her chest, tucking the ends under the belt in the front and back. If she was unmarried or a bride, she adorned her head with a golden, mountainlike crown with several peaks. A married woman could be recognized by her anggar, a straight, horizontal headdress embellished with gold foil.1 39</page><page sequence="13">3</page><page sequence="14">11 Ceremonial Skirt (Tapis) South Sumatra, northern Lampung area, Monggala, Abung people Early 19th century Two panels joined: cotton and silk, stripes of warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave; warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts, and warp resist dyed, warp ikat, plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts; appliqu?d with wool, plain weave; embroidered with silk, cotton, pineapple fiber, silver-leaf-over-lacquered paper-strip-wrapped cotton and silver-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip wrapped bast fiber (probably ramie), in buttonhole, double running, split, stem, straight, and surface satin stitches; laidwork and couching; embellished with metal-backed glass mirrors; 110.5 x 113.7 cm (43 V4 x 44 Va in.) 2002.922 The Abung people (see fig. i) encompass several subgroups dispersed over the central and eastern Lampung area, at least some of which produced substantially different kinds of ceremonial skirts, or tapis (see cats. 9-10). This example has been attributed to the northern town of Menggala, located on the Tulang Bawang River.1 The area was settled by the Kunang group, which lived in the mountainous, western part of Lampung until the sixteenth century.2 There are a number of similar tapis in museum collections, although in most cases little is known about their places of production.3 The tapis, which is composed of two horizontal panels, has been cut open. The textile displays four broad bands of warp ikat; light and dark brown in color, they feature a pattern that is difficult to recognize. Using supplementary brocading wefts, the weaver segmented these bands into squares, which she filled with couched stars and stylized horse shapes that are further embellished with tiny, glittering SSBBBKB^^ 41</page><page sequence="15">3 12 Shoulder or Skirt Cloth (kain bidak) South Sumatra, Pasemah area Around 1900 Two panels joined: bands of cotton, silk, gold-and silver leaf-over-lacquered paper-strip-wrapped cotton, plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts; of cotton, silk, gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped cotton, plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts; of cotton and silk weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave; of cotton and silk weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts and bands of cotton, silk, gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped cotton, slit tapestry weave; 232.5 x 106.8 cm (91 Vi x 42 in.) 2002.918 Figure i.

Although gilt threads were used for the couching, only the paper-wrapped ramie thread survives.4 Both panels display a beautifully embroidered band of blue cotton. Here, large, boatlike nagas (mythical dragons) seem to carry smaller ones and are surrounded by scrolling tendrils and small anthropomorphic figures. Every detail was carefully executed: the glass-mirror eyes of the nagas; their linear forms, spotted with tiny squares of colored silk threads; and the fluid lines of the curved extensions underneath their bodies. Groups of narrow, silk warp stripes in red and orange serve as divisional elements and give a rich, warm hue to the fabric. These areas were painstakingly decorated with glass mirrors and couched metal threads. The work was done in a refined taste, aiming at close inspection and admiration. This demanding style of ornamentation is quite distinct from the gold-covered Abung tapis that are fashionable further south. However, tiny mica or glass mirrors are used profusely on the ceremonial textiles of the Kauer people, who live on Sumatra's southwest coast, not far from the mountain area that was the homeland of the Abung some centuries back. It is tempting to speculate that northern Lampung tapis like this still carry remains of a textile decoration that was shared by ethnic groups in western Lampung many years ago. 42 Fabrics from the Pasemah region were woven on narrow looms that rarely exceeded twenty inches in width, so two panels were sewn together when making shoulder cloths or skirts. The horizontal, tricolor ikat bands of this kain bidak (rectangular cloth) are elaborately ornamented with rows of elongated, stepped diamond designs in between narrow lines of supplementary weft rows. The saturated red color is achieved by brown cotton warps and red silk wefts. Figure i.

The gilt parts of the threads have been rubbed off almost completely, so that some of the object's former splendor has been lost. These bands enclose blue-and white lozenges worked in tapestry weave, a rather typical feature of kain bidak from this area (see figure i). The ikat patterns of the end panels display a sequence of stylized flowers that was probably influenced by border designs on Indian pat ola textiles (see cats. I-2).1 The Pasemah plateau abounds with remains of a rich culture that dates back to the early Christian era. Finds include megalithic structures, enigmatic sculptures, and large cist graves with rich grave goods. Buddhist remains, meanwhile, point to links with the maritime kingdom of Srivijaya (c. 670-c. 1275). The Lematang River connected the Pasemah highlands with the capital center of Palembang, port of call to many vessels from the east and west. The river has seen brisk trade for more than a thousand years, so it is not astonishing to find Indian influences in textiles made far in the hinterland. Still, Pasemah textiles (see cats. 14-15) have retained their distinct character, with predominant weft stripes and subtle color gradations that must derive from a distant past.2 13 Shoulder Cloth (?)

Its strong, unrelieved planes of blue and dark red are separated by rows of bold, white triangles known as tumpal, which are stitched onto the fabric with white threads. To create the red panels, weavers inserted red weft threads into the blue warp. A loom with a comb must have been used to space the warp threads; otherwise the red weft threads would not have been visible. The central blue area is bordered on both selvages by stepped white triangles that are worked in a tapestry weave that dovetails and interlocks with the adjoining blue 43</page><page sequence="17">fS??????S?!!03g!^^ V 1 lar: %.#' * &lt;^',?**^**M *.&lt;* *.'*- * ill?.? ? ? ?

This is an unusual feature for a Sumatran textile.1 In the Manggarai region on the island of Flores, sarongs made for high-ranking individuals also display this trait, which was perhaps influenced by the neighboring island of Sumbawa, where textiles decorated with tapestry weave were common.2 The red areas were finished off with a twined stripe that is decorated differently on top and bottom, featuring colored zigzags and lozenges, respectively. In these stripes, the subtle gradations of red and blue are surrounded by white, adding a sophisticated touch to this otherwise rather simple piece. Another feature that might go almost unnoticed is the use of four weft ikat threads that were inserted on both sides close to the end. In Indonesia, weft ikat is normally used with silk rather than cotton; it is, however, encountered in some cotton textiles from the Bengkulu/Pasemah area west of Lampung.3 Because there are no known textiles closely comparable to this piece, it is difficult to determine its function in the Komering area, which is located in the southeast of Sumatra. The Komering people adhere to a form of Islam that incorporates ancestor worship. The cloth might have had a ceremonial use, or it could have served as a shoulder cloth. There is another Lampung textile in the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, that is technically different from this one yet displays similar blue and red color planes and embroidered, double rows of tumpah 14 Skirt Cloth (kain bidak) South Sumatra, Pasemah or North Lampung areas Early 20th century Silk, gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped cotton and silver leaf-on-adhesive on paper-strip-wrapped cotton, plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts and bands of weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave; 236 x 112 cm (92 7/&amp; x 44 x/% in.) 2002.984 This textile consists of two identical panels joined together. The overall design displays a decorated center field sur rounded by borders and rows of tumpal (triangles) that point toward densely ornamented end panels. The patterns are worked in silvered and gilt supplementary weft rows,</page><page sequence="18">but most of the gilding has disappeared. The layout and material indicate an Indian influence, which was probably introduced by textiles from the Palembang region on Sumatra's east coast (see cat. 20). However, the horizontal bands in the center field, which consist of three-color weft ikat, contain simple hook-and-diamond motifs that are typical of ikat designs from the Pasemah area. These bands alternate with rows that are decorated with supplementary weft rows and also with groups of very thin, subtly colored weft stripes. One rare feature is the presence of two nar row, outer borders running lengthwise. Most comparable Pasemah textiles lack this special attribute (see cat. 12), but it is found on similar pieces in North Lampung. Such cloths were worn by male members of the aristocracy on ceremonial occasions and also served them as shrouds during their own mortuary rites.1 Textiles from Pasemah have a distinctive character that results from a number of tra ditions governing color combinations, designs, and techniques. These festive garments do not display exuberant forms or a dazzling array of hues, but rather patterns that are derived from a geometrically oriented tradition. It appears as though influences from courtly Palembang were incorporated into the striped vocabulary of an older, simpler textile convention. 14 45</page><page sequence="19">15 Shoulder Cloth (tengkuluk) or Waist Sash (pelung) South Sumatra, Pasemah/Bengkulu area Early 20th century Silk and gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped cotton and gilt metal-strip-wrapped cotton, plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts; upper end: knotted, plied and re-plied main warp uncut fringe; lower end: knotted plied and re-plied main warp cut and supplementary patterning weft loop fringe; 196.2 x 44.2 cm (93 x 17 Va in.) 2002.956 The red foundation of this narrow textile is almost entirely covered by a dense decoration of metallic supplementary weft threads, which create diverse variations on the diamond motif. Two different kinds of metal threads were used. In one, typically imported from China, paper strips covered with a thin layer of gold leaf are wound around a cotton core; for the other, possibly from India or Europe, a gilt-metal strip was used instead. As is customary, the design is not arranged symmetrically. What is strange, however, is the presence of identical, broad, double rows of sprouting patterns that are placed base-to-base in the end areas. Normally, different or naments would have been used in these two rows, as on some Batak textiles from North Sumatra, which possess "male" and "female" sides.1 Colored skeins of silk are knotted into one end, which would have been displayed prominently in the front when the cloth was tied. 46 m?mzmmm %&amp;4%m&amp;&amp;&lt;^ &amp;#&amp; -?-#* l^**"* in.BHH 11 ?IIIi???, m'M; mX? -J5 Wwmm ip::^-^ : -S? ?? ???^ ililk?***^*^? ? se ^ i ;pf? *,wi*,*??:Jf-" :. &amp; ?; ?^?KSSfi! ???M *? ?f?^^^V?j^K ISfiSP</page><page sequence="20">16 Shoulder or Head Cloth {selendang) West Sumatra, Tanjung Sungayang area, Minangkabau people 19th century Silk and gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped silk, plain weave with supplementary patterning and brocading wefts, plied main warp fringe terminating in knotted silk, cut tassels; 166.4 x 7I-8 cm (65 V3 x 30 3A in.) 2002.960 Several weaving centers, each with its own typical designs, developed in the Minangkabau area over the centuries. The village of Tanjung Sungayang, for example, was renowned for its refined shoulder cloths, which were used for special ceremonies including marriages and funerals.1 In the nine teenth century, weavers combined silk threads with traditional bark fibers, which were later supplanted by cotton. This selendang represents one of Sungayang's typical textile styles, in which the dark body of a fabric is subtly enhanced by a grid of light-colored weft and warp threads made of silk.2 The composition itself is structured by the red selvage borders along with some sparingly placed red warp and weft stripes; the areas within are ornamented with gilt supplementary weft rows. Individual gilt blossoms are strewn across the center field. On the ends, a grid of gilt filigree rests against a more solid design of shimmering sprouts; brightly colored silk tassels denote ceremonial use and are a common feature of textiles from Sungayang. The way in which a shoulder cloth was worn held great social significance. Unmarried girls or brides carried a folded selendang over one shoulder and fastened it over the hip. Married women, however, draped a long piece so that it formed a loop under their left arm, tying the ends on the right shoulder. Colors and patterns were also indicators of age and marital status, and no breach of etiquette went unnoticed.3 * '^\ .^^'-^ *-ys*t !l (?'^y&amp;ff iz*&amp;. ^^VfV^r^r 47</page><page sequence="21">3 17 Skirt Cloth (songket balapak) West Sumatra, Minangkabau people Second half of the 20th century Cotton and rayon plain weave with gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton supplementary patterning wefts; 149.2 x 95.6 cm (58 Va x 37 Vs in.) 2005.454 Although of relatively recent manufacture, this superb skirt cloth exemplifies the great splendor a Minangkabau textile is capable of. The name songket balapak refers to the heavy, allover design: gilt threads cover the surface so densely that the red foundation is visible only in the contours and inner markings. The succession of horizontal bands displays? almost without repetition?a dazzling variety of geometric motifs based on angular lines, interlocking hooks, and a modified diamond pattern. The motifs are woven neatly and the designs are perfectly executed. Indeed, the skilled weaver 48 created a magnificent piece that fulfills all the criteria of a highly valued adat textile?in other words, one appropriate for use in traditional ceremonies. While the measurements of this cloth point to its use as a sarong, the width of this piece is very unusual. Traditional Minangkabau looms did not produce fabrics wider than eighty-five centimeters, so it seems that this textile was woven on a modern loom. After the decline of songket weaving in several of the traditional weaving centers in the area, the village of Pande Sikek became the major producer of upmarket songket textiles.1 When creating garments meant to be worn at adat ceremonies, weavers are careful to adhere to the traditional designs, because, according to them, "the motifs are the code of adat. We cannot change them freely."2 At the turn of the twentieth century, researchers cataloged more than one hundred types of Minangkabau motifs, re cording names that had been taken from flora, fauna, and geometry.3 The Minangkabau people considered nature to</page><page sequence="22">be a great teacher, and metaphors alluding to nature abound in their textile art. The scholar Nian Djoemena mentioned an enchanting example: referring to the selvage border pattern called kalauak laka, seen here, she explained that a laka is a tightly plaited rattan holder for round terracotta pots. A well-made laka prevents pots from breaking and lasts a long time, serving as a metaphor for strong, sound relationships that never break.4 Women were taught since childhood how to execute numerous patterns, learning their names and meanings. It was not only the skill of weaving and the mastery of motifs that was transmitted from one generation to the next, but also a whole system of values. Although the Minangkabau embraced Islam in the sixteenth century, adat, the traditional code of morals and behaviors, remained at the core of their culture. It is a relevant factor in the life of Minangkabau people even today. Adat governs social interactions on all levels, including the dress code for ceremonial events. As field researchers have pointed out, someone attending an adat ceremony without the proper attire would not be able to fulfill her role. The most splendid Minangkabau attire was worn at marriage ceremonies by unmarried girls and the bride. Photographs taken around 1900 depict heavily brocaded sarongs, long silk tunics, and gold brocaded shoulder cloths covering the upper body artfully, with the ends hanging down the back.5 Complemented by huge bracelets, necklaces, and glittering crowns, this apparel must have been a breathtaking sight. These textiles still play a part in marriage alliances, in which the bride's family gives a songket to the groom's relatives, who respond by presenting a ring and other valuables.6 18 Ceremonial Waist Sashes (ikak pinggang) West Sumatra, Solok village, Minangkabau people 19th century 2002.906: cotton, silk, and gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton, bands of weft-faced plain weave, plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts, and bands of slit tapestry weave; ends of wool, plain weave; fulled; edged with tape of cotton and gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton, and gilt-metal strip; plain weave with secondary binding warps and supplementary patterning wefts; underlaid with tape of cotton plain weave with extended paired wefts and gilt-metal coil fringe; 331.2 x 6.4 cm (130 3/8 x 2 Vi in.); 2002.907: cotton, silk, and gilt-metal-strip WWHf#l#?l^ "\ 1 '\J: 49</page><page sequence="23">wrapped cotton, bands of plain weave, plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts, and bands of interlocking tapestry weave; ends of wool, plain weave; fulled; underlaid with cotton, plain weave; embroidered with cotton and gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton in laidwork and paper padded couching; embellished with gold-colored metal spangles; edged with tape of cotton and gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton, and gilt-metal strip; plain weave with secondary binding warps and supplementary patterning wefts; underlaid with tape of cotton, plain weave with extended paired wefts and gilt-metal coil fringe; 387.4 x 7.6 cm (152 V2 x 3 in.); 2002. 908: cotton, silk, and gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton; in bands of plain weave, plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts and slit and dovetailed tapestry weave; ends of wool, plain weave; fulled; edged with tape of cotton and gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton and gilt metal strip, plain weave with supplementary wefts; underlaid with tape of cotton, plain weave with extended paired wefts and silvered-metal coil fringe; 335 x 9.5 cm (131 7/s x 3 3A in.); 2002. 909: cotton, silk, and gilt-metal-strip wrapped cotton, bands of plain weave, plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts, weft-faced, plain weave, and slit tapestry weave; ends of wool, plain weave; fulled; with hammered white metal fitting and fringe of chain and cut, hammered end pieces; 318.8 x 7 cm (125 Vi x 2 3?'m.) Community leaders in the Luhak Tanah Datar district wore these rare ceremonial sashes at rituals and festivals. Their festive garb comprised dark trousers, a jacket, and a short sarong secured by an elaborate sash such as this. Valuable textiles underscored their wearers' social standing and were therefore linked with their public status. Highly esteemed, pieces like these were kept as treasured heirlooms.1 More than nine feet long, these sashes were folded lengthwise and fastened once weaving was complete. The ends were covered with a narrow strip of imported red flannel fabric and then firmly secured with a metal brace that held metallic tassels or chains. Much work went into making such textiles, which begin and end with a densely ornamented panel featuring rows of geometric designs worked with metal threads and silk. Between these framing elements is a long section in tapestry weave; here, bold patterns based on a diamond-and-cross motif glitter against a dark-striped background of tightly packed silk wefts. Unlike other sashes worn further north in the Minangkabau area, this special type seems to have retained archaic patterns in spite of the use of foreign material. Minangkabau textiles were woven on a treadle loom, a type usually found in mainland Southeast Asia. With treadle looms, foot-operated heddles are used to create the openings in the long, discontinuous warps, unlike the hand-operated 50 heddles used almost everywhere else in the Indonesian Archipelago. Weft-faced weaving is another specialty of Minangkabau artisans that is unknown in other Indonesian ethnic groups. The elaborate patterns of the supplementary wefts, executed with gilt and silvered threads, were controlled by inserting pattern sticks into the back part of the warp. 19 Cover for Ceremonial Betel Stand (tutuik or saputangan siriah) West Sumatra, Minangkabau area, Silungkang Early 20th century Silk, plain weave; cut and drawn threadwork embroidered with silk in weaving stitch filling; attached silk edge cord and corner tassels of silk, wrapped; wrapping threads embroidered in knotted buttonhole stitches; cut fringe; 53x52 cm (20 7/s x 20 V2 in.) 2002.990 Known as a tutuik, this textile charms viewers with its vivid coloring and the enigmatic designs around the borders. Only those who have done similar work can estimate the time and patience that went into producing this small masterpiece. The border decoration was done in what is called suji papan (needle weaving) in the Minangkabau area and drawn work in Europe. To achieve this kind of effect, the maker would have removed parts of either weft or warp threads along all four sides by pulling out a single thread at a time, making sure not to damage the remaining ones. Once she had taken out a sufficient number, she could start building up the ornamentation with a needle and floss silk threads. The silk needlework went back and forth between two thin bundles of remaining threads, which functioned like a warp. Suji papan designs have a strong geometrical quality due to their stepped outlines and blocklike structures. In this case, each borderline is decorated with an assortment of different insects, including butterflies. Women in the highland village of Kota Gadang were famous for this type of needlework. They would have ob tained the original woven materials from Silungkang. It has been reported that, in the early twentieth century, young girls were exempted from other work in order not to spoil their sensitive fingertips. The drawnwork technique was in troduced by Dutch women whose husbands were officials in the colonial administration. European influence was strong in Kota Gadang, since its county was the first in West Sumatra to come under Dutch control.1</page><page sequence="24">3 Tutuik are used to cover the carano, a footed brass cere monial bowl that stores the containers for the ingredients of betel quid. These include chopped areca nut, slaked lime, and a flavoring such as cloves, all wrapped up in a heart-shaped leaf of the Piper betle vine and chewed during many social situations. Distributing betel quids at formal gatherings and ceremonies is an important part of the festivity, and great care is taken in preparing and presenting them.

Of exceptional quality, these fabrics displayed intricate designs with minute details worked with gilt threads on red dyed silk. The gold thread used in shoulder cloths had a silk core that was wrapped with lacquered paper strips covered in pure gold leaf, which was very pliable and had a rich, warm sheen. Over time, designs became more rigid, and gold alloys of lesser quality came into use. While the production of these rich fabrics continues to this day, precious materials and a love of detail are features of the past. This shoulder cloth is stunning in its lavish display of gilt ornaments. The center field features a foundation fabric of deep purple-blue, and the end panels are red, which suggests that both the warps and the wefts were dyed twice. The deeply saturated ground provides a striking backdrop for the elaborate ornamentation. The outer border has an unusual design of vine leaves that was clearly modeled on European prototypes, whereas Indian-derived patterns would ordinarily have been used. As scholars have pointed out, the colors of skirts and shoulder cloths conveyed important information about a wearer's status. For example, a widow ready to marry again would wear a piece that combined a green center field and red borders. A widow on the verge of remarriage proclaimed her engagement with a purple center field and red borders.1 Figure i. Dressed for a dance after the rice harvest c. 1920, these girls from Komering, Sumatra, wear heavily brocaded shoulder cloths from Palembang. 53</page><page sequence="27">W -.- w v 'W^^?k?^^^^i^S^S^^^^^ 54 21 Shoulder Cloth (selendang limar) South Sumatra, Palembang area End of the 19th century Silk and gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped silk, weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts; em broidered with silk in satin, single satin, and stem stitches; embellished with gold spangles; 208 x 90 cm (81 7s x 3 5 3/8 in.) 2002.993 Worn by a woman, this ceremonial shoulder cloth displays a center field of weft ikat and end panels decorated with needlework and gilt supplementary wefts. The delicate, somewhat austere design of the ikat follows closely an old Indian patola pattern based on a stylized flower with four heart-shaped petals. The dye sequence started with red, followed by yellow and blue. By carefully planning the different stages of the resist wrappings and allowing some parts of the weft threads to be overdyed, the maker was able to create a multicolored center field that balances blue, green, orange, light pink, purple, and red in subtle harmony. A band with a finely worked gilt braid marks the beginning of the end panels, which are the highlight of the piece. They are beautifully embroidered with a creeper design and a row of buta, an Indian motif that represents a stylized flowering shrub with a drooping tip. This kind of ornamentation is typical for an embroidered selendang. The outlines of the pattern, none of which are visible here, were made with black ink, perhaps applied with a wooden stamp. The needlework itself is perfectly placed and densely packed, resembling enamelwork on the red silk foundation fabric. Scholars have suggested that needlework was used as a time-effective way of ornamenting the end panels of selendangs. Richer versions would have been decorated with supplementary gold thread patterns, which required the use of multiple pattern sticks to create the elaborate design.1 However, the range of colors and the painstakingly executed needlework of this selendang are an equal match to a brocaded one. Palembang textiles, which evolved as luxury goods in the environment of the sultan's palace, display many adaptations of foreign influences. In this case, the weft ikat technique and designs derive from India and the embroidered satin stitch from China. Both countries had longstanding contacts with the court of Palembang.</page><page sequence="28">. iL.V=?' - ^^,rT-T^^^ center of tin production. The wealth generated by this industry found one of its expressions in the exquisite textiles produced in the port city of Muntok. There, weavers specialized in sarongs and shoulder cloths that they decorated in weft ikat and often with brocaded gilt work as well. While the designs closely followed Palembang examples, the color pal ette included a warm yellow that stood out against a red or purple ground color. The ikat work was often of excellent quality, featuring intricate, curvilinear designs that were difficult to achieve, since they required the weaver to execute many small resist wrappings. This sarong displays the typical mix of colors favored by Bangkan weavers. The design, a repetitive combination of floral elements and birdlike images, is a favorite theme of Palembang ikats and appears in numerous variations.1 The bird may represent Garuda, the mythical mount of the Hindu god Vishnu. Closely related imagery can be seen on Javanese batik patterns and some cotton textiles imported from India in the eighteenth century.2 The pattern also recalls the intricate leaf-and-flower ornamentation of a 22 Sarong (sarong limar) Bangka 19th century Silk and gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped silk, weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts; attached waistband of cotton, warp-stripe plain weave; 98.1 x 116.2 cm (38 78 X453?in.) 2002.982 The island of Bangka, situated off Sumatra's east coast near the Palembang region, was for many centuries a major decorative panel at the temple com plex of Candi Loro Jonggrang in central Java.3 The center or kepala (head) of the sarong is richly decorated with brilliant gilt threads, which form two opposing rows of triangular tumpal that enclose a field of tiny, varied blossoms. At some point, a striped piece of cotton fabric was attached to the upper part, evidently to accommodate a taller person. When the garment was worn, this area would have been concealed by a blouse or jacket. The kepala's central position suggests that the work was produced in the nineteenth century. This feature can also be observed in Javanese batiked sarongs of that period. While worn, the kepala would be on the back and the joining seam hidden beneath a fold in the front.4 55</page><page sequence="29">3</page><page sequence="30">3 23 Shoulder Cloth (kain parada) Sumatra, Jambi or Palembang 19th century Cotton plain weave; hand drawn resist dyed, batik tulis; hand painted adhesive with applied gold leaf; 203.8 x 80.7 cm (80 'A x 31 Va in.) 2002.921 This remarkable textile is decorated on one side with gold leaf, which was adhered to the surface with a glue made either with egg white or a mixture of lamp oil and buffalo blood. Known zsprada, this technique was used only on Bali, Java, and Sumatra, where it provided an inexpensive way of producing gold cloth. The design consists of quadrangular, stylized flowers in a finely worked grid, and the end panels depict a typical tumpal row.1 Although small cracks in the surface suggest the cloth's advanced age, it is still in very good condition. The reverse side reveals a greenish blue center field surrounded by a red area bearing a simple batik pattern of minute white triangles. Dazzling textiles that incorporated precious materials thrived in the context of Indianized courts. They were traditionally made by women, whose products were valued even more than those connected with the male world, like jewelry or weapons. In gift exchanges, which served to strengthen alliances between families, textiles played a major role as precious offerings made by the female's side to the male's, which reciprocated with jewelry, livestock, or money. However, the copious use of gold on textiles changed their gendered status, at least in the Palembang area, where they were given by the male side. Thus, on the occasion of a marriage, the bridegroom's family provided the bride with three sarongs and matching shoulder cloths of different, yet high, quality: one set for daily wear, another for formal occasions, and a third for the wedding ceremony.2 57</page><page sequence="31">.^VvSA/VVWVVvVv** ?4 *&amp;FV&amp;^V&amp;^^^ i^wss!Sii?:?^^ 58 24 Shoulder Cloth (selendang pelangi) South Sumatra, Palembang area c. 1900 Silk, plain weave; stitch resist dyed, tritik, and tie-dyed resist, edged with gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton bobbin lace and gilt-metal strip-wrapped cotton and silk bobbin lace uncut fringe; 210 x 80 cm (8278x31 Vim.) 2002.962 The word pelangi, meaning "colored rainbow," is a fitting description of the brilliant colors that characterize this type of textile. The term also refers to the resist technique, plangi, used to create the small, off-white circles that decorate pieces such as this. In this technique, the cloth, usually a light Chinese silk, is pushed up and partly or completely bound off with a water-repellent material. Thus the dyestuff cannot penetrate, and the tied-off part retains the original color of the fabric. On this piece, green or purple spots and lines were later applied directly in order to highlight certain areas. However, it is a second technique?stitch-resist dyeing, or tritik?that plays a dominant role on this selendang. The wavy borders, the buta motifs on the end panels, and the diamond patterns in the center field were defined with short basting stitches that were pulled together tightly before dyeing. This kind of resist allows a free creation of pattern outlines. Both the plangi and tritik techniques, which seem to be closely connected to Islamic influences, have a long tradition in India and were introduced to Palembang through trade.1 The cloth is also decorated with a border of gilt lace, and a fringe of gilt and brightly colored silk threads adorns both ends. This last feature implies that the piece would have been donned by an older woman, both as formal outdoor attire and as part of a ceremonial costume.2</page><page sequence="32">3 25 Head and Shoulder Cloth (selendang) Sumatra, Jambi Province, Malay people Early 20th century Cotton, plain weave; hand-drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis; ends embellished with metal chain and ornamental pieces; 213.9 x 89.6 cm (84V4X35 'Ain.) 2002.975 A large lozenge filled with a grid design dominates the center of this piece, while the surrounding space is ornamented with rows of four different kinds of tiny flowers. A triple border with an undulating inner rim runs along all four sides. The work displays a typical feature of batik selendangs from Jambi Province: dense imitation fringe on both ends.1 Also present are tiny silver tassels that are sometimes found on textiles used in the Minangkabau area, which probably indicates that this selendang was traded there.2 The artist created the complex design by drawing the resist lines with molten wax poured from a spouted copper container, or canting, a process known as batik tulis. First, however, she would have treated the prewashed fabric with a decoction made of alum and the wood of the lembato tree, which produced a yellowish tint.3 After applying the wax resist on both sides of the textile, she placed the cloth into an indigo dye bath. As a final step, she removed the wax by boiling it off, resulting in a design that appears light against the blue background. Villages in the Seberang district, close to the town of Jambi in Jambi Province, were the only places in Sumatra where batik was practiced. Tradition has it that local women adopted the art of batik tulis from a Javanese family during the nineteenth century.4 There were a limited number of designs produced, some clearly imitating Indian prototypes, others following brocaded patterns from the Palembang area. To make matters difficult for researchers, selendangs and skirt cloths like kain panjang or sarongs were made on the north coast of Java for export to Jambi, complete with familiar designs and color combinations (see cats. 26, 29). Indian workshops did the same, and even a Belgian factory is known to have produced for the Jambi market. These makers sometimes employed different techniques, using mordant printing for the red designs or applying the wax with a copper stamp, or cap, instead of a canting. In fact, the coloring agent used to make red is a good indicator of a textile's place of manufacture: Sappan wood was used in Jambi, Morinda citrifolia in Lasem on Java, and synthetic dyes in Europe.5 However, long experience and careful scrutiny are needed to differentiate between pieces grouped under the general heading "Jambi." 59</page><page sequence="33">3 26 Skirt Cloth (kain panjang) North Coast, Java, Lasem 20th century Cotton, plain weave; hand-drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis-, 261 x 107 cm (102 Vax 42 Vs in.) 2002.976 This kain panjang (literally, long cloth) is distinguished by its two distinct end panels, one featuring a nearly black background and the other a deep red, both adorned by tiny, regularly placed blossoms. The rows of tumpal pointing into these sections are also colored differently, as are the rectangular panels, or papan, on which they rest. Each of these is filled with representations of phoenixes that are difficult to recognize. A narrow border runs along both selvages.1 The background of the main body, or badang, is white and features six rows of ornament that show lotus plants growing from a tuber. The flowers are fully developed, and each bloom is connected to the other by an undulating appendix that gives the impression of rippling water, evoking the plants' aquatic habitat. Chinese motifs on objects or textiles very often carry a multilayered message, expressing wishes or ideas that are appropriate to the occasion of their use. These meanings are conveyed not only through visual symbols but also through characters that can be pronounced in several, slightly al 60 tered ways, each with a different significance. Flowers are commonly associated with seasons and, by extension, with various stages in life. The lotus in particular is linked with summer and maturity, making it perfectly suitable for a woman in her middle years. In Chinese, the word for lotus is written with two characters, which have a number of homophones meaning "always," "to bind," "to connect," "love," "modesty," and "harmony."2 The design of this kain panjang plays cleverly with the many meanings of the lotus motif. The garment would have been appropriate for the mother of a bride or bridegroom, announcing her mature status and the desired traits of a successful marriage. Due to its differently colored end panels, this textile has been attributed to Lasem, a small harbor town on the eastern north coast of Java, where pieces of this kind were produced for export to Sumatra. Kain panjangs for the Sumatran market had no stitched hems along their ends, since these would have been folded under when worn. Lasem textiles were renowned for their use of a deep red color derived from the roots and bark of Morinda citrifolia. In general, they are named for their color combinations rather than their motifs. Pieces such as this, with an ivory background and blue and red motifs, are known as bang-biru.}</page><page sequence="34">3 27 Sarong Java, Pekalongan, workshop of Elisabeth van Zuylen First half of the 20th century Cotton, plain weave; hand-drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis; 100 x 107 cm (39 78 x 42 78 in.) 2002.972 On Java, both men and women wear the sarong, a tubular skirt that covers the body from waist to ankles. It was the preferred lower-body garment along the north coast, while the kain panjang (see cat. 32) was traditional in the island's central region. Sarongs are usually divided into two parts, the kepala (head) and badan (body). The former consists of an ornamented, upright rectangle that contrasts with the latter in design or color. This sarong is ornamented with a springlike composition of daffodils and lilac sprays interspersed with butterflies, which is repeated both in the kepala and the badan. The background changes from red to light blue. Figure i. Detail of cat. 27, showing the maker's signature. 6l</page><page sequence="35">During the nineteenth century, batik workshops were established in several of the major settlements along Java's north coast with the intention of producing commercial trade goods; up until that point, women made batiks in their own homes and for private consumption. The female owners of these new workshops, who were of either European or mixed ethnic origin, created high-quality textiles that were designed to appeal to specialized clienteles through distinctive designs and color palettes. The port city of Pekalongan became the center for Indo-European batiks and was home to several famous workshops. Works from these ateliers carried the owner's signature as a sign of their superior workmanship. Originally, north coast batiks were based on Indian export textiles in terms of their layout, color palette, and motifs, with the most characteristic trait being juxtaposed rows of tumpals (triangles) in the kepala. Later, as they fell under Indo-European influence, batik artisans began to favor other designs, including floral motifs such as bouquets, shrubs in bloom, and vines, which were stylized to varying degrees. The kepala lost its tumpals and its straight, surrounding bands; arched borders of floral vines or patterns imitating lace were used instead. Here, in the upper corner of the badan, the signature E v Zuylen appears in white, marking this piece as the work of Elisabeth van Zuylen (i863-1943), an enterprising Indo-European woman who owned what was probably the longest-running workshop in Pekalongan. Her trademark look incorporated bouquets of European flowers that were drawn in a naturalistic, economical style. Petals often show white contour lines and inner details, and the precise design sits crisply against clean, solid-colored backgrounds. Workers achieved this effect by boiling?instead of scraping?off the wax completely after each immersion in the dye vat and rewaxing the whole cloth before beginning the next step. This time-consuming, elaborate treatment made batiks from Van Zuylen's firm extremely expensive and thus affordable only to very wealthy consumers.1 62 28</page><page sequence="36">28 Head Scarf (kain kaligrafi or kain bersurat) North Coast, Java, Cirebon 20th century Cotton, plain weave; hand-drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis; 203 x 89.8 cm (79 7/8 x 35 3/8 in.) 2002.971 The port city of Cirebon on Java's north coast has been a center of Islamic faith since the fifteenth century. Its batik makers were traditionally male, one of the few exceptions in a predominantly female profession. These men took a distinct approach to batik patterning, emphasizing bold lines and a dynamic use of space. In the nineteenth century, however, things changed under Dutch rule: due to heavy taxes on agricultural land, many men had to give up batik work for better-paying jobs, and women stepped in to take their place. However, some of the male design tradition lingered on.1 Cirebon produced special batik textiles for export to Sumatra, where they were purchased by Muslims. These fabrics are known as kain kaligrafi or kain bersurat, as their design was based on Arabic script. They are ornamented with invocations to Allah that are often rendered in an extremely stylized form; these include the word bismillah Figure i. Detail of cat. 28, showing birds, flowers, and Arabic script. (in the name of God), which is recited at the start of each sura of the Qur'an. In Islam, the written word is highly symbolic: the medium of the sacred Qur'an, it is regarded as the highest art and can even serve as a protective talisman. Writing also conjures up many associative meanings. For example, a calligraphic figure in the shape of a birds may allude to the belief that Allah came to earth in that form.2 The design elements of kain kaligrafi, then, both proclaimed their wearers' Muslim identity and warded off evil. This example clearly reveals wax resist lines that were drawn by hand. Balancing the strong contours of the birds and the Arabic script are finely executed flowers and a border of densely placed lines imitating a fringe. The border of red crocheted silk confirms the textile's use in Sumatra, where this feature is frequently encountered as a finishing device on scarves. Photographic evidence demonstrates that pieces such as this were worn by men, who wound them around their heads in Arab style. Although we do not know on what occasions blue-and-white versions were favored, red-and-white kain kaligrafi were used as protection in battle and covered the bodies of fallen heroes on the way to the grave.3 29 Skirt Cloth (kain panjang) North Coast, Java, Cirebon, workshop of H. Mohammed Masina c. 1970 Cotton, plain weave, hand-drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis; 248 x 103 cm (97 78 x 40 V2 in.) 2002.977 Founded in 1378 by the Muslim ruler Walangsungsang, Cirebon was the only city along Java's north coast in which court life played a dominant role, inspiring spiritual and artistic expression. A vital seaport with trade links to the east and west, it was home to significant enclaves of Arabs, Chinese, and Indians, who added their traditions and beliefs to the local customs. There evolved a distinct, hybrid culture that incorporated the diverse traits of the town's multinational community. Cirebon's batik art expresses these multilayered influences most vividly. At local courts, textiles were ornamented with several groups of distinct batik designs. Among these was the Chinese motif of layered rock or coral (wadas), which was often presented in combination with water and sometimes 63</page><page sequence="37">3 the cloud pattern (megamendung) as well. These elements appear frequently in the friezelike designs of the taman arum (fragrant garden) design, which echoed the meditative landscaped retreats of Cirebon's rulers with its depictions of grottos, ponds, and ancient trees.1 Such scenic creations originated with the East Javanese Majapahit Empire (1293-1515), whose elite had close connections to the early monarchs of Cirebon. Traces of the taman arum appear in this delightful textile, which features scenery that is displayed in two friezes framed by dark bands that seem to combine the Chinese rock-and cloud motifs of earlier times. The blue, balloonlike shapes are reminiscent of the gunungang or kayon, a tree of life motif that also functioned as a crucial element in wayang (shadow puppet theater), where it was used to indicate the beginning and end of performances. The shapes are filled with sinuous trees, monkeys frolicking in their branches. Elsewhere, graceful roosters stand atop mountains, looking down at rippling waters filled with the creatures of the sea (see fig. 1). In Cirebon the forest rooster, known as ay am alas, was thought to herald the dawn of Islam. According to local legend, Islam spread from the first Muslim settlement on the mountain Gunung Jati.2 In the upper frieze appear representations of garudas and nagas, mythical bird- and snakelike creatures that are of Hindu derivation but rendered here in Chinese style. The surface of the textile was treated with starch and carefully rubbed with a shell to obtain a beautiful sheen that enhances the ornamentation. 64 Figure i. Detail of cat. 29, showing a rooster who looks down from his mountaintop perch at the sea creatures below. Of excellent craftsmanship, this piece reveals how Cirebon's old court tradition of batik making has been taken up and transformed with new color schemes and combinations of motifs. Important to this revival is the workshop of H. Mohammed Masina, which has enjoyed great success thanks to the expertise of its staff of third generation batik artists.3</page><page sequence="38">3 30 Skirt Cloth (kain panjang pagi-sore) North Coast, Java, Pekalongan (?) Mid-20th century Cotton, plain weave; hand-drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis; 235 x 107 cm (92 Vi x 42 78 in.) 2002.973 During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in the 1940s, there was a scarcity of fine cotton fabric suitable for batik work. The Peranakan workshops, run by owners of mixed Chinese and Javanese descent, responded by developing a distinct design style called Djawa hokokai.1 Kain panjangs of that time were generally of the pagi-sore (morning-late afternoon) type, which features a diagonally bisected format with a light half and a dark half meant for daytime and evening wear, respectively. The two sections were also ornamented with different motifs, which further heightened the garment's versatility. This kind of kain panjang was long fashionable within Peranakan's Chinese community. As this example indicates, however, patterns became larger, multilayered, and much more intricate in the 1940s, when it was necessary to make the most out of the fabric. At this time, innumerable details were added to the background as well as to the overlaying flower or animal motifs. One popular example of these is the Chinese "butter fly admiring flower" motif that appears on this garment, which signifies the attraction of man (butterfly) to woman (flower) and is found on many Chinese wedding clothes.2 Japanese influence, however, is apparent in the use of round cherry blossoms and sometimes garish color combinations. Wide, undulating borders of contrasting design, called terang bulan (full moon), also became fashionable. After World War II and in the wake of Indonesian independence, several Indo-Arabian workshops developed this style? which became known as Djawa baroe (New Java)?to new heights using new color schemes that appealed to the modern Indonesian elite and upper-class Indo-Arabians.3 The light half of this Djawa baroe, visible at left, has a background of green and light blue vertical stripes filled with tiny flowers. Butterflies hover above blue, light red, and yellow blossoms with pointed petals and also form part of the wide border. The background of the darker half shows a variation of the diagonal parang menang (winning daggers) pattern, which is of Central Javanese derivation. The butterflies appear again here, but the flowers are of a round variety. When this batik is compared to other examples of the Djawa baroe and hokokai types, one can see that there is less diversity in the ornamentation of both halves, and the amount of detail is rather limited.4 The piece is signed Alfrat and Basmeleh in the upper-left and lower right corners, which might indicate that it was produced in an Indo-Arabian workshop. 65</page><page sequence="39">3</page><page sequence="40">3 31 Sarong tiga negri Java 20th century Cotton, plain weave; hand drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis; 201 x 106 cm (79 '/s x 41 Va in.) 2002.1012 This type of sarong is known as tiga negri (three regions or cities), which refers to the fact that the design and coloring were executed in different locales on Java's north coast and in the principalities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta in the island's central region. Initiated in the second half of the nineteenth century by Chinese traders on the north coast, this style of batik ornament combined excellent craftsmanship with design features and techniques characteristic of various batik centers. Lasem, on the eastern north coast, was famous for its red mengkudu dye, and it was there that the production of many tiga negri batiks was begun with the application of the main ornamentation and red dye. Next, in another coastal town, they received additional resist patterns and an indigo dye bath that produced the blue color. The last step was adding the soga brown ornamentation, which was mostly restricted to the fine, painstakingly executed background. This work was done by central Javanese artisans, who were famous for their filler designs.1 Not surprisingly, tiga negri batiks were very expensive, and they were worn mostly by wealthy Indo-Chinese women of the north coast. This expressive example is ornamented with two different sets of diagonal stripes for the kepala (head) and badan (body). A narrow, undulating red border surrounds both sections. The badan's wide stripes are set off against each other by the interplay of light and dark colors and dense and open patterns. One of the filler ornaments is the century-old kawung motif; derived from the courtly larangan (forbidden motifs) of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, kawung are said to represent the halved fruits of the sugar palm. The ornamentation of the blue stripes is a variation of the parang rusak (oroken dagger) design, also part of the larangan pattern group. 67</page><page sequence="41">3 32 Skirt Cloth (kain panjang) Central Java, Yogyakarta c. 1930 Cotton, plain weave; hand-drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis; 246.7 x 105.4 cm (97 '/s x 41 Vi in.) 2002.970 In Central Java, both men and women wear kain panjang as wraparound skirts; on men, they are wrapped from right to left and on women from left to right. On formal occasions the front part is neatly pleated, which creates a very trim silhouette and helps the fabric move gracefully. This kain panjang is ornamented with scenes from the Javanese shadow puppet theater, or wayang, which are placed against a spotted background known as dele kecer (scattered soy beans). Each scene is different, and some of the figures are easily recognizable. At center left appear the three panakawan, a family of comic servants (see fig. 1). The first of these is the wise Semar, who sports a big belly; he is followed by his brothers Nalagareng, with a club foot and a round coin around his neck, and Petruk, who is distinguished by his height, large nose, and tufts of hair. Another figure is Bima, one of the five Pandawa brothers who represent the forces of good in the Mahabharata, the Indian epic poem that enjoyed great popularity in Indonesia. Bima, a giant, is easily identified by his sacred kainpoleng (a black-and-white checkered skirt), fierce expression, distinctive hairstyle, and 68 sharp thumbnail (see fig. 2). All of the scenes are enclosed by bands of the parang rusak (broken dagger) design, which form a diagonal grid. At each intersection appears the intricate monogram TMR, which probably refers to the garment's owner.1 While wayang scenes have a protective connotation, wayang figures also suggest wisdom and experience, and kain panjang like this one are commonly worn by older people. Variations on this style of ornamentation appear frequently on textiles from the court of Yogyakarta.2 In the seventeenth century, the rulers of that sultanate (and also those of its rival, Surakarta) made the wearing of batik obligatory at court. A collection of special designs called larangan (forbidden patterns)?the diagonal parang rusak motif among them?was reserved for the sultan and his relatives in the eighteenth century. Even today the larangan are honored, and outsiders do not enter the palace district wearing clothes with this ornamentation. Figures 1-2.

Specialists are employed to drape the dodot, since different styles are required for special occasions, and it can take up to two hours to achieve the proper arrangement. Dodots worn by men were draped over trousers made of Indian double ikat cloth, while women wore a kainpanjang (see cat. 32) underneath. This particular type of garment is known as dodot bangun tulak alas-alasan pinarada mas, a complex name that sums up all its distinguishing features. In Central Java, special textiles are thought to be imbued with protective powers and are therefore called bangun tulak, which means "to fend off evil." They possess a white center on a bluish black ground that is patterned using wrap and stitch-resist techniques. The term alas-alasan (like a forest) refers to the motifs, a menagerie of animals from the earth, sea, and sky, all separated by delicate plant forms. This abundant combination of flora and fauna is thought to refer to the totality of the universe.2 All of these designs are rendered in gold leaf, a technique alluded to by the words pinarada mas. This style of dodot is specific to Surakarta (more commonly known as Solo), where the ruler, or Susuhunan, donned it for ceremonial purposes.3 Brides and bridegrooms also wear this garment during the most important part of the wedding, as they have exceptional status at that moment. Javanese batik dodot are similar in size and layout to the Indian cotton textiles that were a major export to Sumatra and Java from the seventeenth through nineteenth century.4 69</page><page sequence="43">3</page><page sequence="44">3 34 Half of a Ceremonial Skirt Cloth (dodot) Central Java, Surakarta (Solo) c. 1900 Cotton, plain weave; hand-drawn wax resist dyed, batik tulis; main warp fringe (at lower/outer end); 385 x 107 cm (112 74 x 42 7s in.) 2002.978 The dimensions of this textile, as well as the fringe at one end, indicate that it is one half of a ceremonial skirt cloth, or dodot. The refined, intricate design and the soft coloring, with its off-white details, point to the piece's origin at the court of Surakarta. The quality of the cotton is very fine. The ornamentation belongs to the semen category, one of those patterns reserved for the ruler and members of the court (see fig. 1 and cat. 35). While at first sight the sheer abundance of design elements is bewildering, it is also fascinating to explore the jungle of ornamentation, which represents vividly the complex nature of the universe. Two repetitive elements, however, give a certain structure to the layout. One is a slender tree with strong roots and downturned flowers or fruits, which grows out of a concave container. The other is a pair of powerful wings, called lar, belonging to the mythical bird Garuda; these are surrounded by undulating mountains that teem with birds, plants, and frolicking animals.1 Figure i.

In Central Java, the ritual court dress for women includes the kemben, a long, narrow chest cloth that is worn wrapped around the upper body, leaving the shoulders bare. Versions like these, which were made for married women, announce their wearers' status through a large, diamond-shaped center field. Apart from batik, these pieces frequently reveal the use of additional resist-dye processes such as plangi, which was used to create the elongated diamond shape in the central section of the smaller kemben at right. Tritik, the stitch resist technique, produced the diamond's delicate, wavy outlines and the tiny dots that glow on the dark surface. These garments belong to the ritual category known as kain kemhangan (flowered cloth), as do the dodot, large, ritual hip cloths (see cat. 33) and some square headcloths (iket). The kain kemhangan are part of an older textile tradition that existed before the present textile designs evolved at the courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (also known as Solo).1 Apart from their function as clothing, smaller kain kemhangan are also used as ceremonial textiles, gifts, or sacrificial objects. Although different color combinations seem to play an important role in the meaning of these works, further research is needed in order to understand what their exact significance might be. The batik design of the larger kemben at left belongs to the category known as semen, a name that derives from the Javanese word semi (to sprout). It is a representation of the Javanese cosmic realm and belongs to the group of larangan batik motifs that are reserved for the sultan, his relatives, and other members of the court.2 The semen pattern abounds with representations of animals, curling plant tendrils, mountains, shrinelike buildings, and the wings of the mythical bird Garuda, mount of the Hindu deity Vishnu. While variations are endless (see cat. 34), this particular version displays a slightly unusual stylistic element. As a rule, different motifs are juxtaposed in relation to a central feature; in this case, however, the fish and bird images are not focused on the Garuda wings and the little shrines they enclose but are instead paired in relation to the central diamond shape. This stylistic trait introduces a lively quality into what might ordinarily be a tranquil design. Here, the diamond-shaped element was dyed a subdued green, a shade associated with the beautiful goddess Ratu Kidul, who is believed to live in the ocean off Java's south coast. She is considered to have been instrumental in establishing and maintaining the dynasty of Mataram (1582-1755) and the subsequent courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, which survive to this day. Even now people refrain from wearing this color when walking along the south coast for fear of being taken to the goddess's abode beneath the waves.3 37 Belts (sabuk and epek) and Buckles (timang and lerep) Central Java, Surakarta (Solo) Early 20th century Human hair, iron, and gold leaf, weft wrapping; 2002.1004a: 89.5 x 14.9 cm (35^x5 78 in.); 2002.1004b: ^y.S x 5.7 cm (38 V2 x 2 Va in.); 2002.1004c: j.j x 5.5 cm (3 x 2 78 in.); 2002.ioo4d: 7.1 x 2.7 cm (2 7s x 1 in.) Made of women's hair, these belts were a specialty of the court of Surakarta. Beyond this, we know little about the objects, their wearers, or their means of manufacture. They may have been used as talismans of some kind, and production seems to have stopped in the first half of the twentieth century.1 In Central Java, a narrow cotton belt (epek) was gen erally worn atop a wide sash (sabuk) as part of a man's formal dress, which consisted of a kain panjang, a long hip cloth. Dignitaries and members of the ruler's family would have worn the kris, or ceremonial dagger, tucked inside their waistband. Belts made of human hair were employed in the same manner. A large buckle (timang) was used to fasten the narrow belt, and a smaller buckle (lerep) acted as a sliding holder; special attention was often given to their adornment. Hair belts were regularly treated with special concoctions to keep them supple and pliable. Those made of gray or white hair were most highly valued.2 Male weavers produced sturdy cotton belts on special looms with foot treddles, and it has been reported that they also manufactured hair belts with backstrap looms.3 However, close scrutiny reveals that these pieces were not woven but rather made with a wrapping technique. Under magnification, it is possible to discern that several hairs were 73</page><page sequence="47">37 assembled to make a strand, and that several strands were braided into a thick "thread." The fabric structure includes a foundation consisting of two layers of passive warp threads running across the width of the material. It is possible that this kind of structure could have been produced on a toothed frame (see "Supplementary weft wrapping," p. 23). 38 Aristocratic Waist Cloth (saput songket) Bali, Singaraja c. 1925 Two panels joined of silk and gold and silver-leaf-over-lacquered-paper strip-wrapped cotton, weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave with supplementary patterning and brocading wefts; edge along selvages with silk and gold and silver-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped cotton, plain weave with supplementary patterning warps; 130 x 133 cm (51 78 x 52 Vsin.) 2002.992 74 f.*~ u?

This variety reflects the multicultural nature of Balinese society, in which the ancient gods and ancestors are never very far away. Kain songket, precious silk textiles embellished with gold and silver, were a product of Bali's princely courts, which were heavily influenced by Indian culture. In creating these objects, highborn women were contributing their skills to the display of aristocratic splendor and power. For centuries songket textiles were produced solely for consumption at court. Economic growth and democratic developments 75</page><page sequence="49">during the late twentieth century, however, made price the only barrier to wearing them.1 This example is composed of two rectangles joined at the selvages, visible at center. The main field is decorated with narrow, alternating stripes worked in weft ikat and supplementary wefts. Both the ikat and brocaded patterns are relatively simple: the former consists of zigzag lines, the latter of horizontal S-shapes in gilt and silvered thread. The precise positioning and layout create a pleasing sense of regularity that is balanced and accentuated by the broad end parts, which display a row of gilt and silvered tumpal elements on a gilt band. A narrow golden border (tepi) embellished with a supplementary gilt warp runs along the outer selvages. During ceremonies, aristocratic men would have worn this type of textile, which was called a saput or kampuh, as a second waistcloth, securing it with a belt (sapuk). Such textiles are woven on a backstrap loom with a discontinuous warp. Before the warp is set up on the loom, a woman specialist known as a nuduk is entrusted with the programming of the supplementary weft weave patterns. For this, she inserts additional pattern sticks and pattern heddles into the back part of the warp?as many as 120, depending on the design. This process is very time consuming and requires patience and a keen eye. The warp is now ready to be set up on the loom, and weaving may begin. An accomplished weaver might spend five days on a simply ornamented shoulder cloth and up to two months on a richly embellished waist cloth.2 39-41 Breast or Shoulder Cloths (anteng or cerik) Bali 20th century 2002.958a: silk, cotton, gold-leaf-over-silver-on-lacquered-paper-strip wrapped cotton and silver-on-paper-strip-wrapped cotton, weft banded plain weave with supplementary patterning and brocading wefts; 312.3 x 34.7 cm (123 x 13 78 in.); 2002.958b: silk and gold-leaf-over-silver-on lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped cotton, bands of weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave and of plain weave with supplementary patterning and brocading wefts, main warp pile and knotted fringe; 280 x 37.5 cm (no Va x 14 Va in.); 2002.958dl Silk and gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip wrapped cotton, plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts; 286.7 x 48.3 cm (112 78 x 19 in.) Up until the 1930s, Balinese women did not cover their upper bodies in public save during ceremonies in temples 76 3</page><page sequence="50">77</page><page sequence="51">and palaces. Long silk cloths like these were part of a noblewoman's costume for such events; a wearer would have wound one tightly around her torso and breasts, passing one part over her shoulder. Nowadays these textiles have been widely replaced by the long-sleeved, lace kebaya-blouse (see cat. 38, fig. 1), which is of Javanese origin. The other components of a ceremonial costume included one long waist cloth of cotton and another of a precious material, secured with narrow bands.1 No woman would attend a temple festival without being properly dressed for the occasion. Breast and shoulder cloths come in many varieties. Some might be ornamented completely with weft ikat, others show a combination of ikat and songket, and still others display ornate supplementary weft patterning (as the one shown here at bottom) or narrow transverse stripes of different colors (as at top). Vividly colored threads made of silk or viscose were used for supplementary wefts. Apart from different geometric patterns, designs included fanciful creatures and characters drawn from Hindu epics and local beliefs; creepers and flowers; and patterns that defy interpretation due to many alterations over time.2 Like ornate waist cloths, these fabrics were formerly produced in Balinese courts by women of noble birth. 42-43 Ceremonial Textiles Bali, Buleleng End of the 19th century 2002.955 a: cotton and gold-leaf-on-paper-strip-wrapped bast fiber (probably ramie), bands of plain weave; knotted main warp fringe; 154.6 x 50.8 cm (60 7/8 x 20 in.); 2002.955b: cotton and gold-leaf-on paper-strip-wrapped bast fiber (probably ramie), bands of plain weave, weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave and weft-faced plain weave; warps are space dyed; knotted main warp fringe; 126.3 x 434 cm (49 Vax 17 7sin.) Among traditional Balinese textiles, there is a group that non-natives easily overlook and underestimate due to their modest appearance and simple technology. Including thirty to forty different types, these works are made of cotton and patterned with warp or weft stripes and sometimes with a checker design. They have their counterparts, at least in regard to color, pattern, and technique, in the striped and checkered kain luriks from the neighboring island of Java.1 In South Bali they are called bebali, while in North Bali there seems to be no special term used to identify them. Some are employed as ceremonial waistcloths, others are piled up as symbolic wardrobes (rantasan) for ancestors and deities, placed in temple shrines and altars (see fig. i).2 For instance, at the inaugural celebrations after the renovation Figure i. Textile offerings at a temple in Pejeng, Bali. The statues are wrapped with textiles as well, and prada cloth covered with gold foil is draped in the background. 7? of an important ancestor temple, three bundles of unused bebali, in addition to other textiles with uncut warps, are wrapped around the shrines. Each bundle contains a full set of traditional Balinese clothes: first and second waist cloth, belt, and breast cloth.3 Cotton breast cloths are woven rath er loosely and show greater variations in design and color combinations than the waistcloths, which are mostly checkered. Often the breast cloths are further embellished with weft metal threads; these are hardly discernible as such, however, because the gilding on the paper strips, which have been wrapped around a fiber core, has long since rubbed off. A thin, off-white cotton thread accompanies each metal</page><page sequence="52">^^t^^11.?yI??

Parts of these were dyed red and dark blue, depending on their position in respect to the colored weft stripes; the dark blue sections correspond to the almost black weft stripes. Another peculiarity is the insertion of some very thin (only two wefts) stripes of tricolor weft ikat, which are nearly hidden among the red weft bands. The warp threads of both textiles have been knotted at the ends. These traditional textiles are full of meaning, sending messages about a piece's function as well as the status of the person who wears it. Among the higher castes, there are specialists who know all about which colors and designs are appropriate for different occasions, and these women help organize temple festivals and often supply the necessary paraphernalia.6 Black, red, and white are associated with the under, middle, and upper worlds, the tripartite hierarchical order (triwangsa) of the Balinese cosmos. At the same time, these colors are also identified with the Hindu deities Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva, respectively, who create, maintain, and destroy the universe and are responsible for the cycle of life on earth.7 Textiles such as the one at right, therefore, are highly complex symbols of the totality of the cosmos. Both of these works are said to have come from a princely court in Buleleng; the checkered blue and green one at left is a typical product of the Cintamani area in Central Bali.8 44 Ceremonial Shoulder Cloth Bali 19th century (?) Silk, cotton, bast fiber, and gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-wrapped silk and gold-paper-wrapped bast fiber (probably ramie), bands of weft resist dyed, weft ikat, plain weave and plain weave with supplementary brocading wefts; attached fringe of silk, silver-paper-wrapped silk and gold-paper-wrapped bast fiber (probably ramie), wrapped and knotted cut fringe; 64 x 189 cm (25 Va x 74 Vs in.) 2002.954 When this enigmatic textile was acquired, it was identified as coming from the village of Sembalun on Lombok. Both its dimensions and layout suggest its use as a shoulder cloth. 81</page><page sequence="55">3 Ingeniously designed and worked by a very accomplished master weaver, it was fashioned with silk warps and cotton wefts. For the supplementary wefts, she used three kinds of thread, one made of an unidentified bast fiber, another of gold-covered paper strips wrapped around a silk core, and a third of gold-covered paper strips wrapped around a ramie core. This type of thread appears in Balinese ceremonial textiles as well (see cat. 42), and here too, the gilding has almost completely disappeared. The center part is ornamented with a sophisticated design of weft ikat stripes that cleverly alternate with bands filled with horizontal, brocaded S-shapes. Each ikat stripe contains a succession of stretched, diagonal lines that are carefully varied and aligned to create the appearance of arrowheads. The arrowheads are prevented from being properly joined, however, by a thin red line featuring supplementary weft weave. The weaver used the same principal of directional juxtaposition on the bands, designing the brocaded S-shapes so that the red foundation echoes the S-pattern in a slightly more slender way. The end panels depict two variations of the tumpal (triangle) pattern; the angular, inner design alternates with a floral element, while the fluid, outer one is leaf-shaped. Tiny blossoms dot the field in between. The style of the inner tumpal shape closely resembles the ornamentation on some Balinese waist cloths.1 Among these is a type called kain sembiran, whose place of man ufacture has been the focus of recent research in which both Sembalun and the northern Balinese town of Buleleng have 82 been suggested.2 Since this textile has silk warps, a feature that is absent on Lombok weft ikats, and because its style is strongly similar to brocaded fabrics from Buleleng, a Balinese origin is most likely. 45 Ceremonial Cloth (geringsing wayang kebo) Bali, Tenganan Pegeringsingan 20th century Cotton and double ikat; 240 x 56 cm (94 Vi x 22 in.) 2002.985 The double ikat cloths (kamben geringsing) from the village of Tenganan Pegeringsingan in the eastern part of Bali are the most important and famous ceremonial textiles from that island. According to tradition, the settlement was founded by the Hindu god Indra as a representation of the universe. The inhabitants still follow ritual law strictly in order to keep their village, and by extension the cosmos, in a sacred and balanced state. This unique spiritual attitude permeates all layers of the community. During the many public and private rituals that take place, ceremonial clothing has to be worn by men and women, boys and girls. Among these textiles are double ikats, which serve as waist cloths, belts, or shawls, depending on their size and ornamentation. They protect the wearer's state of purity with their inherent magical power.</page><page sequence="56">This example belongs to the geringsing wayang type, which takes its name from its resemblance to scenes from the wayang shadow puppet theater. One can see, however, that the work is dominated by three large star shapes, each with four rays. Separated by these rays are mirrorlike scenes that depict three people. Here, a squatting man with turbanlike headgear, which denotes him as a priest or hermit, is greeted by a woman who kneels reverently before him. Another individual, who can be identified as a woman by her gracefully bent arm, is sitting behind him, her head turned back; her wrapped headcloth suggests that she may be the priest's wife. The trio is rendered in a style that was used on reliefs decorating the monuments of the Majapahit Empire, which flourished in eastern Java during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.1 There are no Balinese traditions that might suggest what story the scene is alluding to. In general, geringsing wayang kebo are preferred as garment offerings to the gods, although women wear them as shoulder cloths on certain occasions. Tenganan Pegeringsingan was the only place in Indonesia where the double ikat technique was employed. However, the first dyeing was done with indigo, which required the wrapped bundles of warp and weft threads to be taken to the neighboring village of Bugbug, since indigo dyeing was thought to be impure and was therefore forbidden in Tenganan. After their return, mordant dyeing with Morinda citrifolia was used to produce the color red. In the case of geringsing wayang, the same parts are dyed both blue and red, resulting in a purple-black pattern with thin red outlines. Signs of high quality include a deep black color and very precise outlines with only the faintest shimmer of dark red. Textiles without good coloring are not suitable for ceremonial use in Tenganan and are sold to outsiders. These fabrics are woven on simple backstrap looms with continuous warps, which means that they form a loop when taken off the loom. They are kept intact if used as offerings and during particular ceremonies; if worn as garments, the warps are cut. Geringsing are highly valued throughout Bali as ceremonial textiles, employed during rites of passage and to demarcate sacred spaces or objects.2 46 Woman's Ceremonial Skirt (lawo butu) Flores, Bajawa area, Ngada people 20th century Three panels joined: cotton warp resist dyed, warp ikat, warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave; joined with cotton in laced cross stitches; embellished and beaded with cotton, glass beads, shells, and pieces of metal; 83 x 186 cm (32 Vs x 73 Va in.) 2002.933 Women's ceremonial skirts like this lawo butu came to scholarly attention only in the 1980s. Treasured heirloom pieces, they were used only occasionally by mature Ngada women of the highest social class. The Ngada people live in a remote, mountainous area in the west-central region of Flores. Ngada society is divided into a hierarchy of three classes, with membership determined by the mother's status. Despite the Ngada's conversion to Catholicism in the 1920s, they have preserved many of their traditional beliefs and practices. Rituals relating to the life cycle, such as birth, marriage, and death, or events like the construction of a new home are important affairs in village life. All of these provide occasions to don ceremonial garments that proclaim the wearer's rank through their patterns and embellishments. This textile is a lawo butu, a long, tubelike garment made of three cotton panels that feature ikat and appliqu?d designs of beaded figures and nassa shells. The laced cross-stitches joining the panels together are part of the embellishment as well. Ngada women secure their sarongs at the shoulders with thick cotton threads; a trademark of all Ngada sarongs, they are attached on the upper seam. Only experienced women undertake the task of tying the ikat designs for a lawo butu. The patterns are always rendered in light blue against a dark blue ground, and, 8}</page><page sequence="57">,.m/?\ :?M? -y^m^. 46 84 judging from published examples, do not vary widely.1 The broad, inner panel might depict bands with geometrical ikat designs or show vertical rows of elephants or horses with rhomboid figures. (The horse was a symbol of wealth in many Indonesian societies.) Also indicating status are the ovoid shapes that top the double row of zigzag bands running down the center. These represent the golden ear ornaments worn by Ngada women. Wealth was also indicated through the application of glass beads, which were costly, highly treasured objects traded from afar. For many centuries, the small town of Arikamedu on India's Coromandel Coast supplied the Indonesian Archipelago with yellow and orange beads that are recognizable by their uneven shapes and colors. Men created the beaded designs, which women later attached to the sarongs.2 When a piece was worn out, the beaded ornamentation was taken off and sewn onto a new sarong. This must have been the case here, because this sarong is clearly not an old one. Even the ikat design is of a new variety, since the equestrian figures that appear here have not yet been observed among the known repertory of lawo butu patterns. It is difficult to determine whether this garment was recently reassembled for local use or whether it was produced for the tourist market. 47 Bridewealth Skirt (kewatek) Lembata, Hi Api, Lamaholot people Early 20th century Three panels joined of cotton and silk, stripes of warp resist dyed, warp ikat, predominant warp, plain weave and predominant warp plain weave; 66x16% cm (26 x 66 Vs in.) 2002.1006 This sarong was woven on the small island of Lembata, which belongs to the Lamaholot culture and language group that includes eastern Flores and the Solor Islands. There are three traditional weaving centers on Lembata?Lamalera, Lerek, and Hi Api?each of which is characterized by distinct stylistic approaches. Three-paneled sarongs like this one, with a dark blue center field, were the required bridewealth cloth in Kedang, on Lembata's northeast coast. Since weaving was traditionally prohibited there, the textile producing villages of the Hi Api Peninsula supplied Kedang's residents with the ceremonial sarongs they needed. Unlike bridewealth sarongs used</page><page sequence="58">^jJK?Bair,-i-/r-"_^-;.T' ' '-'"-'^??^jj5 47 elsewhere on the island, these works display additional silk highlights that were added for affluent customers.1 Similar cloths were also sold to neighboring islands such as Alor and Adonara.2 On this piece, the center panel is flanked by two outer sections; mirror images of each another, these are decorated with warp ikat bands of different widths. As is typical of Lembata ikat patterning, the designs are worked very precisely, and stepped outlines predominate. The largest band contains a lozenge motif with double hooks at the outer ends and squares with representations of the giant manta ray. This motif is widely used on traditional sarongs from the island, since these majestic animals live in the surrounding ocean and are caught by the fishing community of Lamalera on the south coast. Here, the somber blue and red shades were enlivened with warp stripes of light-colored silk.3 Traditionally, bridewealth sarongs are made especially for the gift exchange that occurs at the time of marriage; they are seldom, if ever, worn. Gifts from the bride's family may include ceremonial sarongs and bracelets; the groom's relatives might present animals, rice, or elephant tusks, although the latter are rarely seen in modern times. After marriage, the sarongs become the property of the husband. 48 Skirt (lau pahudu) Sumba, Kapunduk area Last quarter of the 20th century Three panels joined: top and bottom panels: cotton, warp-faced plain weave with cotton, polyester, and rayon supplementary patterning warps and bands of warp-faced weft-ribbed plain weave; stripes of warp resist dyed, warp ikat, warp-faced plain weave; and of warp-faced plain weave; center panel: cotton, warp-faced plain weave with cotton, polyester and rayon supplementary patterning warps; 142 x 128 cm (55 78 x 50 78 in.) 2005.455 Made for a woman, this richly decorated skirt demonstrates the vitality of Sumba's recent textile production and the expertise of its female weavers. While she employed traditional patterns together with long-established tech niques including warp ikat and supplementary warps, the maker nevertheless departed from the conventional design for a ceremonial sarong. In East Sumba, women's skirts were always composed of two cloth panels sewn together. Here, however, a narrow third panel was inserted into the 85</page><page sequence="59">^suscm6 IS: ?mstfib. omzzm l**^!?^^ *&amp;j? *&amp;&amp;} &amp; ?ff "4 &gt; &amp; ?ff ?4 *&gt; -? fr ?5 5s ?5 fi M&amp;WiMjM&amp;q? sS?

The upper part is decorated in a very elaborate manner, which is not really necessary, because when worn, this section is pleated in the front and tucked in, obscuring the design. On older lau pahudu, therefore, that area is mostly adorned with simple stripes. 86 East Sumbanese weavers specialize in creating or namentation with white supplementary warps, producing designs that appear as a twill weave in white on a dark ground. It requires substantial skill to manipulate the tension of the basic warp threads of the ground weave and the thick, twined threads of supplementary warps. Highborn women</page><page sequence="60">create pattern guides for the designs that consist of two sticks with a cotton warp in between; thin pattern sticks are inserted into these to form a desired pattern unit.1 In the coastal regions of eastern Sumba, these aristocratic women traditionally oversaw the production of ikat and supplementary warp textiles, which were needed in great quantities for marriage and burial ceremonies.2 In the first half of the twentieth century, Dutch colonial administrators took a fancy to the colorful and expressive ikat textiles, which were used as men's waist and shoulder cloths. To meet this foreign demand, workshops soon sprang up in ports along the northeast coast. This proved to be an important development, since it allowed weavers to escape the confines of tradition, stimulating new patterns and helping keep textile production strong. The royal courts of East Sumba are still the most creative textile centers on the island, working both for local consumption and the tourist market and maintaining a very high technical quality. Producing textiles has become a major enterprise and a backbone of the local economy. 49 Man's Ceremonial Waist or Shoulder Cloth (hinggi) Sumba Last quarter of the 20th century Two panels joined: cotton, warp resist dyed, warp ikat, warp-faced, weft-ribbed, plain weave; ends: cotton, warp faced plain weave executed with a second set of warps laid parallel to main wefts and worked by the main warps; re-plied main warp fringe; cut second set of warp fringe; 165 x 306 cm (65 x 120 Vi in.) 2002.996 When attending a funeral, aristocratic Sumbanese men still wear hinggi, ceremonial waist and shoulder cloths ornamented with colorful warp ikats (see fig. 1). Members of noble families are buried with great quantities of such works, sarongs for women and hinggi for men. Ikat textiles of recent manufacture are occasionally a bit overwhelming due to their sub stantial size, prolific ornamentation, and vivid colors. They are also decorated with sometimes surprising motifs. The weaver of this hinggi, for instance, transformed a venerated skull-tree motif into a sort of passenger boat (visible in the third decorative band from the center) and introduced a line of frolicking shrimp at top and bottom. She also, however, took care to include traditional, Emmmmmmmm .4&gt;y '?V :&amp;: m im "' * ""' 'lip ' J .-.-..?..-.-. ?Pw^??M^ WWfx,,?w^,A*&gt;&gt;t?t? "Iil^IllMl lillliV?

Part of its population derives from the island of Savu further west, and Ndao language and cultural components are closely connected with those of Savu. Since residents could not support themselves through agriculture due to Ndao's small size, a specialized division of labor developed. Most men are gifted gold- and silversmiths who supply neighboring islands with jewelry. Women produce textiles not only for themselves, but also for the population of Roti. Indeed, there 88 3</page><page sequence="62">are several myths that recall, in rich language, how weaving and pattern making arrived in Ndao and Roti.1 Designs are very similar on both islands, and it is not always possible to tell whether a fabric from Roti was indeed woven there or on Ndao.2 However, an uneven number of ikat bands are a characteristic trait of wraps made for Ndao men, a memory of textiles used on Savu. Although weavers now prefer imported threads and chemical dyes, their great skill is undiminished, as this men's waist or shoulder cloth demonstrates. The resist technique was carefully executed, and the design is crisp, if a bit stiff. The long fringes are a miracle of thin, tightly twined threads, which possess a tactile sensuality. The ikat bands are filled by angular, flowering creepers, a design that derived from the legendary, snakelike pattern dula pilas, which served as a prototype for a number of band ornaments that assumed an increasingly floral character over time.3 Older examples of these cloths often display triagular tumpal endings on each band that were copied closely from those on treasured patola from India (see cats. 1-2). In this piece, the tumpal design has taken on a different character, resembling those on Sumatran brocaded textiles. Formerly, weavers would have used only blackish blue, red, and white in the ikat bands, but now they are incorporating some blue accents. The palette has definitely changed, as suggested by the thin warp stripes in yellow and light red, but many of the old textile traditions still survive. 51-52 Festive Sarong Timor, Beboki, Atoni people Last half of the 20th century Three panels joined: top and bottom panels: cotton warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave with stripes of warp resist dyed, warp ikat, warp-faced plain weave (paired warps), and warp-faced plain weave with supplementary weft wrapping; center panel: cotton, warp resist dyed, warp ikat, warp-faced plain weave (paired warps) with stripes of warp-faced plain weave (paired warps); 59 x 161 cm (23 Vax 63 Vs in.) 2005.457 Festive Shoulder Cloth Timor, Belu region Last half of the 20th century Three panels joined: Outer two panels: stripes of cotton, warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave; cotton warp resist dyed, warp ikat, warp faced, weft-ribbed plain weave; center panel: cotton and silk, plain '^Mf^^^?f^^^^^^&gt;^rm^^/^^^: &amp;ms&amp;,?w?. 51 89</page><page sequence="63">7?^. v* t\'. ***? ^ -*[ t ?. : Awi** HV* Figure i.

Each of these territorial and political units was characterized by a particular style of textile.1 However, scholars have yet to undertake the kind of thorough research that would allow them to attribute textiles to precise locations rather than wider regions. Timorese women still occasionally wear long, tubular sarongs made up of two to four panels (see fig. 1). The garment is drawn together above the breast and tucked in; today, blouses are generally worn on top. These textiles display their wearer's place in the social hierarchy through their patterns' level of complexity and execution. The same is true of men's attire, which includes artfully decorated shoulder cloths like the one at right; these are paired with shirts and trousers on festive occasions such as ceremonies, political gatherings, and important visits. On such cloths, status is indicated by an abundance of silken ornaments known as letros. This sarong is composed of three panels. The center is covered with large, concentrically filled diamond figures in dark gray, off-white, and rust red, framed by groups of thin, vividly colored warp stripes. The black outer panels are ornamented with bands of multicolored geometric designs (see fig. 2). These were produced with a special technique called buna, in which supplementary weft threads are wrapped around the warp threads during the weaving process. The resulting ornamentation is easily mistaken for needlework. This decorative approach reached its climax in central Timor, where rulers, wealthy through the sandalwood trade, were able to afford expensive silk thread from China. Sarongs such as this do not appear in museum collections that were assembled many years ago. Indeed, it is only since the late 1980s that textiles from the border area of Indonesian West Timor and the Democratic Republic of East Timor have been sold in substantial quantities by traders on Bali and in Kupang, West Timor's chief port.2 However, all known examples from this border zone are composed of four panels, so it may be that the second center panel of this sarong, which would have mirrored the ikat design, was either removed or never included in the first place.</page><page sequence="64">91</page><page sequence="65">53 Sarong Democratic Republic of East Timor, Los Palos area, Watu Lari 20th century Two panels joined: stripes of cotton, warp resist dyed warp ikat, warp faced, weft-ribbed plain weave and warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave; 51 x 147 cm (20 Vs x 57 7h in.) 2002.998 This woman's sarong displays all the hallmarks of old Indonesian textile traditions, including handspun cotton, which is pleasing to touch and handle; the harmonious effects of natural dyes; attractive banded ornamentation; and challenging, enigmatic designs. Made in the area of Los Palos, situated at Timor's northeastern tip, it is one of the very few examples of its kind in a Western collection.1 The sarong consists of two panels joined together with a decorative stitch. At the ends, two wide, precisely worked ikat bands, which are separated by a blue warp stripe, de pict a sequence of tricolor designs including the tumpal, a sequence of three anthropomorphic figures, and an eight pointed star. These bands are framed by narrow ikat stripes with an undulating, snakelike ornamentation. Toward the center, another patterned ikat band appears amid a series of very thin, tricolor ikat stripes. The composition of the piece reveals a highly rhythmic sensibility, and the style of its ornamentation is similar to textiles from the island of Kissar, to the northeast.2 Some of Kissar's inhabitants were immigrants from Los Palos who had fled from the Portuguese colonial administration and settled in the small village of Oirata. The former raja of Los Palos had close connections to Oirata, having given one of his daughters in marriage to the village's ruler.3 No information exists about the meaning and purpose of the designs on Los Palos textiles, but research in Kissar suggests that special motifs, including the eight-pointed star, were reserved for noble families, and such may have been the case in Los Palos as well.4 92 W?W^M^M^t^^^^</page><page sequence="66">54 Ceremonial Apron and Headband (men tawe and pilu saluf) Timor, Amanuban area, Atoni people 20th century 2002.926a: bands of cotton warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave with discontinuous wefts and weft twining and counted weft twining with continuous and discontinuous wefts; upper edge binding of cotton, 3 BSsiaa gSaffiB^ty^1^ 93</page><page sequence="67">* ^^" v ' '*?- **** ....'" ? -* ' V**'*' "* Figure i.

The Atoni, who live in the mountainous western part of Timor, have a long history of ritual headhunting. Believed to add life energy to a community, headhunting was an essential act that brought men fame. After his first successful raid, a warrior was presented with the special costume of a headhunter during a ceremony.1 As mid- and late-nineteenth century lithographs illustrate, headhunters in full attire must have been an extraordinary sight.2 Aside from a waist cloth, girdle, jacket, an abundance of silver ornaments, and a headband with attached silver disks, a headhunter's regalia (see fig. 1) included a set of brightly colored textiles that were worked in slit tapestry weave and weft twining.3 These consisted of men tawe, apronlike textiles with long ribbons, and pilu saluf, narrow headbands with slits, long fringes, and dangling glass beads. According to the scholar Mattiebelle Gittinger, these objects possessed great symbolic value, referring by their "torn to rags" (saluf) appearance to a state of "out of normal."4 The Dutch colonial administration banned headhunting in 1910. When attending certain ceremonies, however, de scendants of famous warriors still don these special clothes in order to honor their ancestors.5 Even women are allowed to wear them: at the funeral of one headhunter, for instance, his daughter danced while attired in his ceremonial garb.6 In the Molo area, women who are leaving their house for the first time after giving birth also dress in the headhunter's regalia.7 This practice demonstrates the connections between hunting heads and bringing new life, symbolizing the male and female roles in insuring the community's survival. -S 94</page><page sequence="68">55 Loincloth Babar Archipelago, Babar Island Early 20th century Three panels joined: cotton and silk, stripes of warp resist dyed, warp ikat, predominant warp, plain weave and predominant warp plain weave; 24 x 360 cm (9 7i6 x 141 Va in.) 2002.101 o The Babar Archipelago belongs to the Southern Molukkas, a series of islands stretching eastward from Timor toward New Guinea. Several of these groups had vibrant textile traditions, and locally made sarongs and loincloths possess characteristic motifs and colors. Moreover, they were important trade items: for example, a loincloth from Babar could be exchanged for any number of objects ranging from a cleaver to a piece of valuable red cotton cloth from India.1 This loincloth displays a tumpal design known as kota (strengthened village), in which rows of tumpal with hooked extensions are placed base-to-base.2 In between appear human figures with uplifted arms, said to represent dancers. Both ends of the piece are decorated with two bands of yellow geometrical patterns based on diamond-and-hook motifs and worked in supplementary weft weave. Between these bands, red-and-white key motifs were added in supplementary weft wrapping. The long fringes are carefully twined and display a white ikat resist, as does the garment as a whole. While other islands in the Southern Molukkas prefer banded ornamentation, this type of overall ikat patterning is a special stylistic trait of the Babar Archipelago.3 In the past, Babar men wore loincloths made of bark fiber for everyday work. For festive and ceremonial occasions, they donned long, cotton versions such as this, decorated with blue-and-white warp ikat and supplementary wefts (see fig. i). The ikat designs themselves were family emblems.4 As these ornamental loincloths are now very rare, families keep them as cherished heirlooms, and they are no longer worn.5 Formerly, a man's loincloth would be destroyed upon his death. fl^ft ^^T wK^r I^^H ^IBB d?aM ?Hm l^r^B Hdll^^HHS^I HP^H ^^ul ^^?^B ^ ^ ^^ ^^^ ^1 aS^^^^^IBB^fl^l^^Bl?^ri^BS^^^Bc l^S^^H^Bnf fl^K^^^^I ^^^^^^^^^b MWBa3asia:,.-i?6^^ :*- - ,,.:.- , -. .-..-- ^ _r- ."'

Iban men had a long history of headhunting as a means of acquiring prestige, and the practice lasted as late as the 1920s in the Baleh area, where this cloth was made. Similarly, women gained a high reputation by crafting pua kumbu, powerful ikat textiles intended for ceremonial use. Indeed, the part of the production process in which the cotton fibers are treated with alkali and oil is called kayau indu, or "the women's warpath. " Just as the men's warpath leads to the acquisition of trophy heads, which are symbols of fecundity, kayau indu helps achieve a red coloring once the fibers have been immersed in a dye bath with alum and Morinda citrifolia.1 Along with other textiles, pua kumbu with powerful patterns were used to receive new trophy heads and contain their inherent power.2 This example displays one of these designs, which be longs to a group that, according to scholars, includes the oldest, most valued patterns in the Baleh area. These are known as bua begelong (coil patterns), and most of them are nonfigurative.3 With its large whorls, this design closely resembles a pattern called bua belia IndaiAbang. This name refers to the belia, the sword that weavers use to beat in the weft threads, and to Indai Abang, the sister of a mythical Iban hero who is renowned for her weaving skills. She appears in weavers' dreams, revealing new and beautiful patterns for them to copy.4 This design also corresponds closely to one recorded as the buah remaung (mythical tiger) pattern. Only accomplished weavers would attempt to create such powerful designs.5 While Ikat weaving is still practiced in the Baleh area, coil patterns have been replaced by figurative ones.6 Pua kumbu played a part in virtually all festivals and ceremonies, serving a variety of purposes that have survived to the present day (see fig. i). They act as protecting walls to demarcate sacred space; wrap a temporary shrine; function as a base for ritual food; serve as a seat for a guest of honor; protect a shaman in trance; cover the ill to give them strength; and ensure the deceased a privileged status in the abode of the souls of the dead.7 Indeed, pua kumbu serve two main purposes: they signal to the celestial beings that an Iban individual or group needs their attention and intervention, and they constitute the most effective barrier against physical and metaphysical dangers.8 Figure i.

The dark lines of the grid, which are enlivened with white flecks, guide the eye from one compartment to the other, endowing each couple with its own importance. The narrow warp stripes along the outer borders display ikat designs and a vivid red hue that was achieved through the use of synthetic dyes. Known as engkaramba, designs with human figures are a specialty of the Saribas River area. As attractive as they are, such patterns were by no means considered select. According to local information, Iban weavers resorted to engkaramba as a way to recover after the effort of creating powerful patterns (see cat. 56).1 Indeed, since they is thought to be simple, producing them does nothing to boost a woman's prestige. However, Chinese traders have systematically visited the area in search of pua with engkaramba designs, because they are highly popular with Western clients. By as early as the mid-nineteenth century, the Saribas Iban had abandoned the custom of headhunting under the reign of the English-born raja James Brooke. The gawai, ceremonies held to celebrate a successful headhunting, were gradually given up as well. Since the production of the most important ikat textiles was closely allied to these rites, however, the weaving of powerful ceremonial cloths no longer existed within its traditional context. ?&gt;utpua kumbu continued to be woven, particularly in the 1920s, when many local families grew rich from rubber plantations. Since Iban weavers had access to foreign goods, they were able to use machine-spun threads and synthetic dyes by the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, stylistic hallmarks of pua kumbu from Saribas include vivid black, red, white, and yellow warp stripes along the outer borders and very fine ikat work made possible by thin, machine-spun yarns. During World War II, weaving stopped almost completely due to the scarcity of material and did not resume in a serious way afterward.2</page><page sequence="73">v * til fl d 3l^?^^^B^^I3^1iB^fgjB?il^^?f^^lll^^?rr^^lw3fl^ ' L * * IOO 58 Ceremonial Cloth (pua kumbu) Borneo, Sarawak, Saribas River area (?), Iban people First half of the 20th century Cotton, extended warp-faced, warp resist dyed, warp ikat, plain weave; 119 x 232 cm (46 7s x 913/8 in.) 2005.459 This ceremonial cloth displays several striking features. The viewer's attention immediately turns to the blue, triangular shapes that border the center ornament and are repeated in white on the opposite side. At their base there unfolds a type of snakeskin design that creates an almost three-dimensional impression due to its clever gradations of color. Next comes a row of human figures in different sizes and attires, all with especially detailed head decorations. This impressive center field is enclosed by extrawide borders. There is no published example that compares to this unusual pua kumbu. Due to the presence of machine-spun yarns, synthetic-dyed warp stripes, and rows of human forms, it was probably made in the Saribas River area. Patterns such as this, which contain recognizable forms amid enigmatic designs, lure Western viewers to search for underlying meanings. However, no grammar exists that can help translate these design elements into a clear message. While there are a limited number of ideograms that Iban weavers can combine and vary at will to create an overall pattern, these women often conceive new designs in their dreams. Indeed, a design may have lain dormant in a weaver's mind for years, but she will only create it when explicitly ordered to do so by a dream. She is the only one who knows what is being represented. After finishing the pua and presenting it to her family and to the other inhabitants of her longhouse, the weaver will announce the "praise name" of the cloth, by which it will be known among the community. While this name might allude to a memorable event, the design elements that represent it were of the weaver's own choosing and not necessarily dictated by tradition. If a pua pattern appealed to other weavers, they would copy it after having paid some sort of compensation. In this way, certain designs came to be imitated over many years, spreading over a wide area. Sometimes their praise names went with them, and they became conventional symbols known by many weavers.1</page><page sequence="74">3 59 Ceremonial Cloth (pua kumbu) Borneo, West Kalimantan, Kantu' people Early 20th century Two panels joined: cotton, stripes of plain weave; warp resist dyed, warp ikat, plain weave with paired warps, and warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave with supplementary patterning wefts; plied and knotted warp fringe; 74 x 182 cm (29 78 x 71 Vs in.) 2002.946 Textiles made by the Kantu' people have yet to be thoroughly acknowledged by the wider public, and intensive research has yet to be undertaken. The Kantu' live along a tributary of the Kapuas River in northwestern Kalimantan, the lower, Indonesian region of Borneo. They produced ceremonial textiles like the pua kumbu of the Iban people, to whom they are related. Stylistically, these works are quite similar to those originating in the Saribas River area of Sarawak, the upper region of Borneo that is part of Malaysia (see cats. 57-58).' Common features include the presence of synthetic-dyed warp stripes in the outer borders and the use of machine-spun yarns overall, which results in a very precise pattern. Thus, if a cloth's provenance is unknown, it is difficult to securely determine which side of the border it hails from. Like Iban examples, Kantu' ceremonial textiles, be they jackets, pua kumbu, or skirts, were only used during rituals. Well-known to the Kantu' was the idea that some patterns are so inherently powerful that only women beyond their childbearing years, and in possession of ritual knowledge and advanced weaving skills, are permitted to attempt their creation.2 It may be that some of the common elements o? pua kumbu resonated with such beliefs. For instance, while the warp stripes on the outer borders fulfill the aesthetic function of framing the main design, they may also serve to contain a powerful pattern, preventing its force from escaping.3 It appears as though ceremonial textiles made by the Iban themselves, and by other Ibanic groups such as the Kantu', can be regarded as parts of a collective complex, sharing major traits and displaying regional variations.4 101</page><page sequence="75">3 6o Woman's Ceremonial Skirt (kain kerlip) Borneo, West Kalimantan, Pontianak Early 20th century Cotton and wool plain weave self-patterned by ground weft floats; embroidered with silk, cotton, and gilt-metal-strip-wrapped cotton, in single and surface satin stitches; laidwork and couching; metal spangles; lined with cotton, plain weave; 105 x 87.9 cm (41 Vs x 34 Vs in.) 2002.945 Pontianak was formerly the capital of a sultanate that was founded on the west coast of Borneo in 1771 by Syarif Abdul Al-Kadri and a group of fellow Arab adventurers. Successive rulers maintained close ties with the British and the Dutch, and in 1950 the sultanate became part of the Republic of Indonesia. 102 Fabrics from Pontianak are very rare in museums and private collections, since the main focus of interest has historically been on Borneo's tribal art.1 As was the case with garments worn at other courtly centers such as Palembang (see cats. 20-22), Pontianak textiles displayed their wearer's wealth and status through the use of precious materials and labor-intensive production techniques. The city's many Chinese inhabitants stimulated the market for Chinese luxury goods, some of which were used to make this ceremonial skirt. Imported black damask cloth was used as the foundation for a profusion of bright sequins (kerlip) and multicolored silk threads. These decorate the skirt in Malaysian fashion with a central tumpal panel bordered by a latticework of embroidered leaves enclosing single flowers.</page><page sequence="76">6i Festival Banner (roto) Sulawesi, North Luwu Regency, Rongkong people 20th century Cotton plain weave; tie dye resist, plang; 74 x 357 cm (29 Vs x 140 Vi in.) 2002.939 The Rongkong people produced banners like this, which are known as roto, both for trade and for their own consumption. They were particularly cherished by the Sa'dan Toraja living further south, who fastened them to tall poles on ceremonial occasions.1 The roto's bold designs, created with the plangi technique, were visible from afar and served to announce a ritual event, usually the funeral of an eminent person. This example was made of machine-spun cotton, which is very soft and therefore easy to tie in preparation for dyeing. To produce the design, all the areas that were to remain white or be dyed blue were wrapped with a resist binding. The cloth was then dyed red. After removing the bindings for the soon-to-be-blue parts and wrapping up those that were to remain red, the blue dye bath took place. The finished cloth features sections of white, red, blue, and near black, which was achieved by overdyeing red with blue. Roto designs typically include several arrangements of large and small circles divided by transverse bands.2 While this piece contains only four pattern fields, others display six.3 Local people liken the bigger circles and smaller sparkling rings to the sun and constellations of stars.4 One scholar has suggested a link between roto and a similarly patterned type of cotton trade cloth from India, placing them side-by-side in a recent publication.5 Although the similarity is remarkable, the nature and direction of any influence remains shrouded in mystery. *" o O ? i**?*****? 103</page><page sequence="77">3</page><page sequence="78">3 62 Ceremonial Textile (sekomand?) Sulawesi, Mamuju Regency, Mangki people Early 20th century Four panels joined: side panels: cotton, plain weave; center panels: cotton, warp resist dyed, warp ikat, warp-faced, weft-ribbed plain weave; 258x161 cm(ioi 78x63 3/8?n.) 2002.937 The mountainous, central region of South Sulawesi is home to several language groups formerly known as the Toraja, although now only the Sa'dan Toraja bear that name. Two other groups, the Rongkong people of the North Luwu Regency and the Mangki, whose center is Galumpang in the Mamuju Regency, have specialized in ceremonial ikat fabrics.1 These are among Indonesia's most remarkable textiles, which impress viewers with their large size, strong designs, and wide range of production techniques. Displayed during various festivities, especially funeral ceremonies, these creations have attracted the attention of a number of scholars.2 Known as a sekomandi, this piece was used primarily as a shroud; every man of rank kept at least one such cloth to cover him upon his death. It is composed of four panels, with the inner two acting as the main image and the outer ones as frames. The central design, worked in warp ikat, features a succession of hooked diamond patterns that are arranged in three horizontal lines thought to represent ancestor figures.3 Two-plied warp threads rather than single ones were used to strengthen the design. The arrangement and balanced distribution of vivid red, luminous blue, black, and white operate in such a way that the eye constantly moves from one color line or plane to another. Indeed, the design possesses a vibrant energy that can hardly be contained by the border panels, which consist of stripes of varying widths and colors. It is not certain whether these panels are original, since their coloring is much more faded than the center's. It is not always easy to determine whether a sekomandi was made by Rongkong or Mangki weavers, since this type of textile was produced by both peoples. However, Rongkong examples are more loosely woven than those from Galumpang, which have a higher warp density.4 Both areas exported shrouds to the Sa'dan Toraja and further north into the Palu District, where they were used as women's ceremonial skirts.5 105</page><page sequence="79">3 63-64 Ceremonial Textiles (mbesa tali tau batu or pewo) Sulawesi, North Luwu Regency, Rongkong people 18th/19th century 2002.934: cotton plain weave with discontinuous wefts; openwork; resist dyed; 32 x 309.4 cm (12 Vs x 121 Va in); 2002.935: cotton plain weave with discontinuous wefts; openwork; resist dyed; main warp plied fringe; 18 x 332.1 cm (7 Vs x 130 Va in.) Their enigmatic technique and archaic patterns make mbesa tali tau batu some of the most fascinating textile creations in Indonesia. They were certainly employed during death ceremonies, but the Dutch text detailing their use can be interpreted in two ways: it seems that the closest male relative of the deceased either wore the cloth himself or wound it around the head of the deceased.1 The name itself means "headcloth of the stone man, "although they are also known as pewo, signifying "to bind."2 Huge, phallic stone monuments are part of the landscape in north central Sulawesi, and there are still funeral ceremonies that involve the erection of stone stelae. The reference to "the stone man" may suggest an old, ritual connection between these textiles and local megaliths. Mbesa tali tau batu were woven as long, white cloths with several sections of openwork, in which constellations of small slits form the foundation of the design. In the Rongkong area, this weaving technique is called tannunan m. Figure i. Detail of cat. 63, showing one of the geometric patterns created with the tannunan dasi technique. io6</page><page sequence="80">3 dasi (sewn or needlework weaving). The process required the weaver to insert additional wefts two at a time into the warps, passing them back and forth with a bamboo needle to build up the areas between the slits.3 After the weaving was finished, she wrapped small sections of the fabric with resist bindings and subjected the entire piece to red and blue dye baths. Before the latter step, however, some of the resist bindings were removed and some more were applied, resulting in a stunning variety of geometric patterning in blue, blackish blue, red, and white (see fig. i). This unique resist technique is not found anywhere else in Indonesia. The textile shown below displays a number of peculiarities that set it apart from all the others of this type yet published. First, it is unusually narrow?almost twice as thin as typical examples. Second, only red dye was applied, and this, together with the resisted areas, produced white design sections on a red background. Third, there are two sections decorated with a sequence of long, wide slits that are secured by thick, traversing weft threads (see fig. i).A The warp threads are very thin compared to the supplementary weft threads, resulting in big gaps between the slits. While all published examples of mbesa tali tau batu were produced using the technique described above,5 recent research has led to the discovery of yet another type of this ceremonial textile.6 It is a miracle that, despite the current Westernization of Indonesian culture and the dispersal of old heirlooms, there are still some unknown treasures left.
