<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEWS of her results and methods under the following headings: general description, location, form, visibility, size, the problem of reproduction, some detailed characteristics, the spirals, orienta- tion of the markings, and markings in danger of destruction. The photographs and maps show four types of markings: (I) virtually straight, long lines, radiating from centers or more or less parallel; (2) straight-sided trapezoidal or tri- angular figures, isolated or radiating from centers; (3) figures formed by curved lines, some- times resembling labyrinths; and (4) anthropomorphic figures, the details of which are best seen from the air. Size varies enormously, but size repetitions suggest that a measuring standard might have been in existence. The largest marking Miss Reiche reports has an aver- age breadth of 50 meters and extends for a distance of I700 meters. Such dimensions, together with air views showing high pattern density, make it obvious that much human labor was expended here. It has not been Miss Reiche's purpose in this publication to go into the details of astro- nomical observations. This she reserves for another time. However, she brings out such facts as the following: (I) many of the lines can be associated with notches in the mountainous horizon, an indication that they were constructed with a view to that direction; (2) lines trending in certain directions are commoner than others, and especially those with a margin of variation between N 68? I5' E and N 70? Io' E; (3) certain markings could have in- dicated the position of the rising or setting of certain stars in the constellation Ursa Major during the interval between 500 B.C. and A.D. I500; (4) there are lines approximating the meridian, which favor the astronomical hypothesis. Finally, Miss Reiche makes it clear that, with the Pan-American Highway passing through this region and obliterating parts of the markings, there is imminent danger that many will soon be lost entirely. This fact emphasizes the importance of her studies on these intriguing records of the past.-T. D. STEWART HISTORY OF THE WHITE PINE INDUSTRY IN MINNESOTA. By AGNES M. LARSON. xv and 432 pp.; map, ills., index. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, I949. $7.50. 94 x 6 inches. In this study of the white-pine industry of Minnesota, Professor Larson, chairman of the Department of History at St. Olaf College, has made an excellent contribution to the regional history and historical geography of the Upper Great Lakes area and the upper Mississippi Valley. Minnesota's pineries were the last of the great northern pine forests to be depleted. The advent of the white-pine industry in the St. Croix Valley in the i840's and i850's corre- sponded with its demise at the eastern end of the northern forest in Maine. Men from this state were important in the upper Mississippi region, both as sawmill owners and as lumber- jacks. The first lumber camps were even called State-of-Maine camps. Tea was the drink of the lumberjacks. Not until other eastern Americans and Scandinavians began to enter the woods in the seventies and eighties did the lumber camps as we knew them at the start of this century develop; the importance of coffee in the lumber camp, the "Paul Bunyan" stories, the ice road for transport of logs, and many other regional characteristics postdate the "Maine era." The author never loses sight of the importance of the market in the development and continuance of the lumber industry. Consequently, she ably presents the downriver rafting I67</page><page sequence="2">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW of logs to St. Louis, the development of downriver sawmill centers such as Winona, La Crosse, Dubuque, Davenport, Clinton, and Fort Madison, all well removed from the piner- ies, and the coming of the railroads, which broadened the market for white pine and per- mitted the forest region to supply lumber for the settlement of the prairies of southwestern Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. Little of the Great Lakes portion of the white-pine industry is to be found in the study, because Minnesota's markets lay southward and westward, and most of the logging streams were in the Mississippi watershed. Furthermore, at the height of logging in the state, Michi- gan and northeastern Wisconsin were still pinery regions and serviced the Great Lakes markets from Chicago to Buffalo. Only during the last stages of Minnesota logging, I890 to I9IO, did the heart of lumbering in the Great Lakes basin lie north and northeast of Duluth, then an important sawmill town. Perhaps the most surprising fact to the reader not familiar with the regional history is the past importance of St. Anthony Falls-Minneapolis as a great sawmill center. Names of families more recently associated with flour milling at this location appeared during the saw- mill period; several of the sawmill operators were successful in transferring their capital and managerial ability from lumber, as this resource dwindled along the farthest upper Mississippi and the Rum, to wheat and flour as the railroads were built and the prairies were developed. The 60 years or more of logging and lumbering are thus tied intimately to later regional growth and development. The white-pine story ends shortly after the beginning of the present century, when the loggers at last reached the remotest part of the pineries in northwestern Minnesota east of the Red River Valley, and the man-made barrier of the Canadian frontier in the Rainy River district. The stage was set for the pressing regional problems of the present-conservation and rehabilitation of the cutovers. To a geographer the greatest shortcoming of the book is the lack of maps. The location of the "Big Woods" (deciduous) of Minnesota is described by counties, as is the location of the pineries. Longitude 95? 30', said to mark the western limit of white pine in the United States, is the western limit in northwestern Minnesota only. A map showing the original location of hardwoods, pineries, and prairie in the state would help the reader and point up the vastly different environments of northeastern and southwestern Minnesota. Offsetting this lack to a slight degree is a political map on which the counties of the state and a few of the towns are shown.-LOYAL DURAND, JR. UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TIMBER TRADE IN THE PACIFIC AREA. By IVAN M. ELCHIBEGOFF. xvii and 302 pp.; maps, diagrs., bibliogr., index. Stanford University Press, Stanford, Calif.; Oxford University Press, London, I949. $7.50. IO14 x 7 inches. Nearly half of the prewar timber exports of the United States originated in the Pacific Northwest and moved principally to markets in the Pacific area, especially Japan, China, Australia, and Latin America. These exports, which annually amounted to I5 to 20 per cent of Oregon and Washington production, were largely the result of regional over- expansion and consequent forced liquidation in the Douglas-fir industry. Prospects for the revival and greater stability of this trade, which has been completely upset by events of the past decade, are the concern of Dr. Elchibegoff. With an eye on both possible new markets I68</page></plain_text>
