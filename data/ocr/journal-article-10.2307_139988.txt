BARNARD University of Saskatchewan I~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The language of political discourse abounds in metaphors and laments. The general tendency to make abstract ideas more intelligible by expressing them through concrete analogues accounts for the former. The latter are most com- monly the reaction to disenchantment with conditions that have failed to come up to expectation. From the dictionary definition of a metaphor as "the figure of speech in which a name or descriptive term is transferred to some object different from, but analogous to, that to which it is properly applicable" (OED), it follows that the function of a metaphor is to express similarity rather than identity. In practice, however, the degree of similarity implied by a metaphor has a wide range of variation from the most far-fetched comparison to so nearly complete an identification that it is difficult to distinguish the metaphor from a literal description. Thus, for example, a fringe of organismic thinkers- though not the mainstream of political organicism as T. D. Weldon has sug- gestedl-maintained that the state was not merely like an organism but was in fact an organism, and therefore imagined that the laws which control a biological organism should apply equally to the political or social organism.2 Ambiguity may stem either from imperfections inherent in a particular metaphor or from lack of precision in establishing the extent of identification implied. In addition, the assumption of similarity between two objects or two ideas which have many, but not all, of their attributes in common may serve to withdraw attention from their unique attributes which, on occasion, may prove to be the most significant ones. It is also possible, since human beings are rarely completely objective in their thinking, that the selection of a par- ticular analogy may be unwittingly determined more by the prejudices or emotions of the writer (and hence tell us more about the writer himself than about the content of his thought) than by the appropriateness of the analogy. But once an analogy has been chosen it acquires a momentum of its own and later a spurious credibility due to familiarity. On thfe other hand, analogies may be deliberately invented to add rhetorical force to an argument or to provide a rationale for desired conclusions. Metaphors used (or abused) in lStates and Morals (London, 1946), 34. 2See, for example, Morley Roberts, who stresses this identity to the point of absurdity. Whereas Herbert Spencer eventually recognized the difficulties in a too literal interpretation of the organic metaphor (see Walter M. Simon, "Herbert Spencer and the 'Social Organ- ism,"' Journal of the History of Ideas, XXI (1960), 294-9), Roberts is determined to carry, the analogy beyond Spencer, "having none of that peculiar dread of analogical reasoning,' as he puts it, "which afflicts English workers." (Biopolitics (London, 1938), xii.) "States are," he writes elsewhere, "really and not metaphorically true organisms." (The Behaviour of Nations (London, 1941), 1.)

BARNARD this manner are, as we shall see, often invoked as a dialectic device by those anxious for a change in the social or political status quo.3 Like metaphors, laments have a long and honourable tradition in Western political thought. From the Hebrew prophets on, men have lamented defeat in battle, exploitation, subjugation, the exactions of unjust govermments, not to mention their more private and personal griefs. Not infrequently, however, laments have been the harvest of disenchantment, of shattered hopes, of mis- placed confidences. Modem man, especially since the European Enlighten- ment, has grown to cherish an unprecedented faith in human progress and secular redemption. This faith, nourished by the impressive results of science and technology, has emboldened social thinkers, particularly on the American continent, to view the shortcomings of human institutions as problems that are as susceptible to solution as those met in mathematics, physics, or mecha- nics. Among positivistic social and political scientists there were not many who shared Sumner's doubts about the wisdom of trying to "make the world over."4 For most of them the existence of a social problem entailed the possi- bility of its eventual if not its immediate solution. This confident approach to social problems has undoubtedly yielded beneficial results, particularly in the sphere of economic and social welfare. But it has also reaped its measure of disillusionment. Disillusionment over unfulfilled expectations provides one cause for lament; a reasoned conviction that some expectations by their very nature cannot be fulfilled provides another. Discomforting though such a realization may be, it may none the less be indicative of a more profound awareness of the nature and complexity of a social problem and thus supply a corrective to over- sanguine optimism about the scope of social and political engineering. By the same token, a lament may perform a distinctly positive, because catalytic, function within a social system. By portraying a given human condition in its starkest and most forbidding aspect, it may sound a clarion call for a society's soul searching, for its quest towards a fuller understanding of itself. Metaphors and laments, then, are capable of fulfilling a double function. They can serve as methodological aids for conceptual analysis in the study of social and political ideas, and they can also provide a normative basis for the critique of a status quo. II There are fashions in metaphors as there are in clothes. Which metaphor enjoys the vogue in political theorizing at any given time depends on the dominant ideas of the age, especially on those associated with that branch of science which happens to command greatest prestige. Thus the ascendancy of Newtonian physics produced an increasing use of mechanical metaphors. Later, the development of the biological sciences, and in particular the theory of evolution, bestowed a growing popularity on organic metaphors. Now it is 3Logically such a dialectic device is not very different from that described by Pareto in Mind and Society (New York, 1935), 788. 4See W. G.

BARNARD Les me'taphores et les dol6ances peuvent jouer un double role dans le discours politique ; elles peuvent servir d'appoints me'thodologiques a' l'analyse con- ceptuelle et elles peuvent fournir une base normative 2 la critique de n'importe quel status quo. Le choix d'une me'taphore particuliere, qu'elle soit du type mecaniciste, organiciste ou autrement, sera influence par les ide'es dominantes 2 un moment donne', par celles notamment qui de'rivent de telle ou telle branche de la science qui jouit alors du plus grand prestige, et par l'orientation ide'ologique de l'auteur. Cet article examine les doleances sur la perte du sens communautaire et l'imagerie me'taphorique de deux systemes de pense'e, le normatif et le posi- tiviste. On s'en rapportera, en particulier, aux theories communautaires de Herder et a l'e'cole politique romantique. L'ide'ologie qui donne un senm 2 la rhe'torique de Herder differait beaucoup des valeurs fondamentales de son sie'cle. Cette ide'ologie consistait en une conception anti-elite de la science politique, en une interpre'tation du progre's fondee sur la tradition et le relativisme, en raffirmation du caractere changeant de la nature humaine et du pluralisme des valeurs sociales. Elle conduisit Herder a e'tendre l'application du principe moral d'autodetermination de Kant a lrunivers politique et a son insistance sur la coordination fonctionnelle de pr6f6rence 2 la subordination fonctionnelle. La le"gitimite democratique plutot que l'efficience paternaliste constituait pour lui la condition essentielle d'un ordre politique. Ceci ra amene a insister pour que le passage d'une tutelle a l'autod6termination politique se fasse sans brusque discontinuite'. Ce n'est pas par la destruction, mais par une transformation graduelle, des traditions soci6tales et des valeurs, transformations qui s'inscrivent dans le continuum historique d'une communaute politique, que Herder fait la synthese du progressivisme rationaliste de rAge des Lumieres et sa propre philosophie du traditionalisme. La conception du traditionalisme de Herder est egalement eloignee de celle de Burke qui est essentiellement statique et de celle des Romantiques qui essentiellement est reactionnaire. C'est ainsi qu'on peut d6duire de son oeuvre que le lien qui est souvent etabli entre le traditionalisme et le conservatisme politique peut etre plus tenu qu'on ne le crott ge'ne'ralement. De meme, rejeter que la nature humaine soit immuable implique qu'on admet la multiplicite' des valeurs et la possibilite' qu'elles soient incompatibles. Non seulement Herder a-t-il admis le conflit, mais il l'a conside-re comme naturel et il nous a prevenu contre les dangers de le supprimer. Une telle reconnaissance de la fonction essentiellement positive de la diversite' et du conflit ajoute une autre dimension interessante a la conception de Herder sur l'autodetermination politique.</page><page sequence="4">284 F. M. BARNARD Son insistance sur la manifestation spontanee du pouvoir cr6ateur et inte'rieur de rhomme explique pourquoi Herder pre'fe'rait le mode'le d'un organisme a celui d'un mecanisme pour representer la realite, puisque c'est celui-la qui implique l'existence d'un pouvoir inte'rieur comme source ope-rationnelle de l'activite'. Les Romantiques dans le domaine politique ont souvent ete' considere's comme des disciples de Herder, mais l'examen de leur systeme me'taphorique rev'le des divergences importantes d'accent dans lranalyse politique, telles que leur conception de la subordination fonctionnelle par comparaison a la conception de Herder de la coordination fonctionnelle, telles encore que leur conception de rEtat comme organisme unifi6e, par comparaison avec celle de Herder oi l'Etat-modele est conpu &amp; partir d'une approche anarchique et pluraliste ou' l'unite est compatible avec la diversite' dans un cadre social diffrenti4 suivant des lignes horizontales plut6t que verticales.

These different meta- phors are not, of course, necessarily mutually exclusive. Though the mixing of metaphors may easily lead to confusion, the parallel use of metaphors drawn from different branches of science to illustrate different ideas in a political argument can be a perfectly valid method of analysis. Thus, when Burke wished to emphasize the longevity or permanence of the state or some other corporate body, he offended no canon of logical reasoning by abandon- ing his customary biological imagery in favour of either a mechanical meta- phor, or, more frequently, an architectural one.5 It is quite a different matter, however, when the employment of, say, a mechanical metaphor rests on a wholly distorted notion of the actual nature of a mechanism. Both mechanistic political thinkers and organicists were prone to grossly simplified, or highly idealized, normative, if not indeed metaphysical, concepts of mechanism. The most common classical concept of mechanism, based on the notion of "a whole which was completely equal to the sum of its parts; which could be run in reverse; and which would behave in exactly identical fashion no matter how often those parts were disassembled and put together again," was, as Karl W. Deutsch has pointed out, a strictly metaphysical concept.6 For it implied that the parts of a mechanism were never significantly modified by each other, and that each part, once placed into its appropriate position with its appropriate momentum, would stay exactly where it was put, and continue to fulfil its r5For an excellent study of Burke's use of imagery see Walter D.

The notion of a mechanism, wholly controllable by man and isolable from environmental influences, unmodified by spatial or temporal interaction, could not but appeal to those who looked upon human nature as a constant which, at the same time, was susceptible to infinite control and manipulation. It is no accident that the heyday of political mechanism coincided with the almost axiomati- cally held belief that human nature has always and everywhere been the same; such a belief seemed an adequate premise for postulating the opera- tion of simple unchanging laws, which, once discovered, would enable man to harness the forces operating in the social realm just as he had harnessed the forces operating in the realm of nature. This mechanistic conception of unchanging man in an unchanging universe underlay much political thinking, whether of a conservative and complacent or a progressivist and perfectionist brand, up to the end of the eighteenth century and after. It was a conception that accorded well with the rationalistic mode of thinking in the Age of Reason. What is more, two revolutions, one economic, the other political, held out every promise that the transference of scientific principles from physics to economics and politics would be wholly vindicated by the facts of history and by empirically verifiable experience. However, certain events attending both revolutions began to give rise, at first to uneasiness, later to more serious doubts and misgivings, and eventually to a formidable chorus of laments over unfulfilled expectations. Something, it became increasingly evident, had gone wrong somewhere. This sombre realization led to a questioning of the efficacy of social and political engineer- ing and also helped to undermine the prestige of mechanistic metaphors in the social sciences. To be sure, the revolt against mechanicism had already begun before the setbacks of, and subsequent disenchantment over, t-he indus- trial and French revolutions. Ever since Leibniz introduced the concept of vis viva into physics (which later came to be applied to the new science of biology) organic metaphors, which figured prominently in the writings of classical and mediaeval political thinkers, made their stealthy re-entry into the vocabulary of political discourse. Thus, some time before Burke was to lament in eloquent organismic imagery the havoc caused by the French Revo- lution, or Schiller, the "father" of the concept of alienation, was to express his grief over the effects of the industrial revolution, men such as Rousseau, Moser, and Herder were striking chords that were to have resounding echoes during the organicist renaissance of the subsequent era.9 7ibid.

BARNARD In this essay I shall be primarily concerned with two organic models and the metaphorical imagery employed in each: the Herderian model; and the model of the political Romanticists. I shall attempt to examine the sociological and political significance of these models; in passing, I shall also indicate their relevance to recent laments over modem man's estrangement and dissociation from his community roots and to the notions of pluralism and nationalism. III It is astonishing how many key concepts of modem political sociology can be traced, directly or indirectly, to Herder's voluminous though unsystematic writings. The rediscovery of primary and secondary groups as the basic units of society, the concern about various forms of social disorganization, such as alienation or anomie, the problems of consensus, conflict, pluralism, elitism, and bureaucracy, the distinction between Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft- all these themes are more or less clearly discernible in Herder's thinking. Yet Herder is still little known to sociologists and political scientists. No doubt the formlessness of his works, the exuberance with which he expressed his ideas, and the versatility of his interests (ranging from literary criticism, philology, and psychology to anthropology, philosophy, history, and theology) help to account for this neglect.10 Like Max Weber over a century later, Herder was disturbed by the growth of bureaucracy, of which he had first-hand experience in his native Prussia. He feared that it would eventually reduce politics to the regimentation of the mechanicists (The Fundamental Forms of Social Thought (London, 1962), 109-23). Without wishing to deny that Rousseau's mode of expression admits of diverse interpreta- tions, I feel that the tenor of his works taken as a whole reveals a far greater affinity with the community organicists than with the individualist mechanicists. No one was more emphatic in stressing the existence of inner social bonds as the necessary condition of a genuine social contract in contrast to the Hobbesian contract of subjection between rulers and ruled. Also, Rousseau, unlike his contemporaries (particularly in France), had lost faith in reason and science as man's supreme power-a feature more characteristic of organismic than of mechanistic thinking. To say this is not necessarily tantamount to classi- fying Rousseau as a Romanticist. See Ernst Cassirer, Rousseau, Kant and Goethe (Prince- ton, 1945; Harper Torchbook ed., 1963), 19 and 31. It is worth noting in this context that the German Enlightenment (Aufklarung) was by no means as rationalistically or mechanis- tically oriented as is commonly thought. The break with the orthodox rationalist tradition can be traced to such leading Aufkldrers as Christian Thomasius (1655-1728), often called the "father" of the Aufkldrung. Christian Wolff (1679-1754), and Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786). For a fuller discussion of this point see my "Christian Thomasius: Enlighten- ment and Bureaucracy." American Politiral Scienre Ra.ipi, T TY ( 1 QA!b) A.1n . 'Ojohann Gottfried Hferder (1744-1803) is chiefly known as a literary critic, a philosopher of history, and the "father" of modem nationalism. Two biographies have appeared in English in recent years: A. Gillies, Herder (Oxford, 1945), and Robert T. Clark, Jr., Herder: His Life and Thought (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1955). My own study Herder's Social and Political Thought (Oxford, 1965), contains a detailed biblioraphy of primary and secondary literature. To the latter should be added Sir Isaiah Berlin s recent and most stimulating essay "Herder and the Enlightenment," in Earl R. Wasserman, ed., Aspects of the 18th Century (Baltimore, 1965), 47-104. A further possible reason for Herder's lack of appeal to the modem social scientist was his refusal to reduce his heterogeneous ideas to a neat and coherent 'ism,' "to label them and fit them into theoretical frameworks. ... The notorious luxuriance and formlessness of his ideas is due at least as much to his sense of the complexity of the facts themselves as to a naturally rhapsodical and turbid mind." ibid.. 56.</page><page sequence="7">Metaphors, Laments, and the Organic Community 287 barracks square, breed uniformity, and promote a dull, lifeless form of social existence, in which men would become mere cogs in a vast bureaucratic machine. But, unlike Weber, Herder was not satisfied merely to dissociate the "mechanical" from the "political"; he opposed all forms of centralized power. In this he shared the apprehensions of another eighteenth century community theorist, Justus Moser (1720-94), who felt that centralism would destroy the distinctive cultures and traditional customs of local communities, in which he saw the most valuable cohesive factors of social and political association. Herder, however, went both beyond and against Moser in his out- spoken hostility to the traditional "power elite," i.e., the dynastic monarchy and hereditary aristocracy. That those as yet unborn should be destined to rule over others not yet born, simply by virtue of their blood and accumulated wealth, seemed to Herder the most unintelligent proposition that human language could devise, and the most blatant example of unreason in the history of human reason." Whereas Moser accepted the existing social and economic structure and, indeed, judged property ownership to be a necessary qualification for exercis- ing the right of citizenship,'2 Herder insisted on the right to political partici- pation for all members of a community. In this radical, populist demand, Herder not only went beyond the traditionalist Moser but also beyond most of his progressivist Enlightenment contemporaries who were more concerned that men should be governed with benevolence and competence than that they should govern themselves and hence had no serious objection to aristo- cratic privilege, nor even to absolutist rule, provided the rulers heeded their enlightened pleas for toleration, for a more humane treatment of criminals, and for the provision of education and welfare measures for the poor. Herder, on the other hand, whilst conceding that absolute equality was neither realiz- able nor desirable, none the less felt that the degree of natural inequality was by no means as marked as the inequality that actually prevailed.'3 When he therefore advocated co-ordination rather than subordination as the opera- tive principle of a "'healthy community," he wished to stress the mutual inter- dependence of parts within a whole which combined a high degree of hori- zontal differentiation with a minimum of vertical differentiation, where all were "masters" in some sphere, but none were masters in all spheres. In this pronounced anti-elitism, Herder did not even shrink from attacking Kant, the idol of the age. Whilst Kant, though upholding the principle of self-deter- mination in the moral sphere, argued that man in the realm of politics was like an animal needing a master to rule and control him,'1 Herder, extending the llIdeen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (1784-91), XIII, 377. All refer- ences are to the Suphan edition of Herder's Werke (33 vols., Berlin, 1877-1913). 12"It is manifest violence," Moser maintained, "if members of the lower class unite and attempt to claim the same rights to property as members of the higher class by simply basing such claims on a common human origin."

BARNAD principle of self-determination to politics, contended that man was only "man" in the true sense when he no longer required a political master to rule him.15 When we remember the tremendous prestige that Kant enjoyed and remem- ber, too, the political conditions of Herder's Germany-its political censorship, the personal and often arbitrary rule of dynastic princes, and the dearth of channels into which political ideas and activity could be directed-which forced more timid minds to confine their Kantian "idealism" to the safer sphere of symbolic poetry or moral philosophy, Herder's radical and deliberate departure from vague and apolitical Kantian interpretations of freedom stands out as an intrepid act of intellectual courage and integrity. This needs saying, for Herder's contribution to the political application of the principle of self- determination (in the sense of popular participation) has hitherto been only dimly realized if not ignored altogether.'6 What is equally worth stressing (in view of Herder's supposed lack of understanding of, or interest in, poli- tical realities) is that Herder was far from blind to the dangers of conferring political freedom on a people (such as the Germans) virtually devoid of political experience and conspicuously deficient in a sense of common identity. In a relatively early work, Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte zur Bildung der Menschheit (1774), in which he trenchantly castigates his age for its arro- gance and complacency, and bitterly laments its deluded sense of grandeur with respect to its cultural achievements, Herder squarely faces up to the problem of the conflicting pulls of order and freedom. Given the alternatives of more efficient government by an enlightened despot and the possibly less efficient and less orderly political arrangement in which the people participate in government, he unhesitatingly opts for the latter. Even if institutions are not perfect; even if men are not always honest; even if things are less tidy and there are conflicts and disagreements: this is still preferable to a state of affairs in which there is perfect "order," but in which men are destined to rot and decay during their lifetime.17 In place of the "paper-culture" (as he calls it) of the few, Herder pleads for the "humanization" of the many, by which he understands the provision of basic standards of welfare and the gradual transformation of social values and traditions through a process of 15XiII, 383. Even Rousseau, the great advocate of a new social order where a moral ethos was to take the place of rulers, urged the Poles to venerate their ancient nobility as the surest safeguard of maintaining their political freedom as a nation (Conside'rations sur le Gouvernement de Pologne, chap. xI). It was, of course, the Rousseau of the Social Con- tract and Political Economy who inspired Herder no less than Kant. 16Herder's contribution to the theory of national self-determination has of course been adequately recognized. It is surprising that Herder scholars, and in particular those inter- ested in Herder's political ideas, have failed to detect the political import of one of Herder's most mature works which he published in 1783 under the title Vam Geist der Ebrdischen Poesie (The Spirit of Hebrew Poetry). This surprising neglect had the unfor- tunate result of causing Herder's political thought to be judged almost exclusively on the basis of his better known Ideen, in particular its chapter on government which, in view of the political censorship, Herder had to rewrite several times. His most radical political views, therefore, are not to be found in the published version of the Ideen, but rather in this work on Hebrew poetry where he managed to give expression to them under literary and theological disguises. For a fuller account see my "Herder and Israel," Jewish Social Studies, XXVIII (1966), 25-33. 17V, 516. Clearly, legitimacy matters more to Herder than effectiveness, to speak in current sociological terminology.</page><page sequence="9">Metaphors, Laments, and the Organic Community 289 educational dissemination to which he applies the term Bildung. Herder's conception of Bildung is also at variance with the Enlightenment's notion of culture and education. For it is not conceived by him in a purely academic or intellectual sense, or as an entirely external factor to which the individual is merely passively related, but rather as an interactive social process in which men influence each other within a specific social setting and in which they both receive from and add to their distinctive historical and communal heritage. This interactive and reciprocal building up of new societal and political goals within a socio-cultural continuum constitutes for Herder the true purpose of human association in history, the creative, continuous develop- ment of man.'8 Bildung, thus understood, provides the alternative to abrupt socio-structural discontinuities attending the replacement of traditions and values through their prior destruction rather than their transformation. So much for the general political orientation that gave direction to Herder's democratic, or, more precisely, populist conception of organicism. We now have to turn to the cluster of ideas that underlay its pluralistic complexion. IV Herder's second major departure from the prevalent contemporary mode of socio-political theorizing lies in his repudiation of the notion of the immut- ability of human nature. With the possible exception of Adam Ferguson (whose historical works reveal a remarkable degree of sociological insight), even "relativist" writers such as Helvetius and Montesquieu and "positivists" such as Hume, never doubted that, as Voltaire put it, "man in general has always been what he is."19 From the very start of his intellectual career, Herder could not accept the validity of this assumption. As early as 1769 he laid down what remained the basic principle of his relativist psychology: "Human nature under diverse climates is never wholly the same."20 A few years later (in Auch eine Philosophie . . .), he elaborated further on this principle: "Human nature . . . is not the vessel of an absolute, unchanging, independent 'happiness,' as defined by the metaphysician; everywhere it attracts that measure of happiness of which it is capable; it is like pliant clay and assumes different shapes under different needs and circumstances."2' This principle entailed revolutionary corollaries. It became meaningless to think in terms of an ideal man or of an ideal people or of one absolute standard of values. Each historical event, each generation, each culture and civilization carried within itself its own immanent validity. It was, therefore, pointless as well as presumptuous to judge the past, its errors and achievements, wholly in terms of current European standards or in the light of super-historical absolutes.22 Each historical phenomenon had to be seen within the context of l8Briefe zu Befdrderung der Humanitit (1793-97), XVII, 116. W9Voltaire, Oeuvres (Lequieu ed., Paris, 1820), XI, 19. 20IV, 38. 21V, 509. 22V, 524-5. Here Vico had anticipated Herder, but Vico was virtually unknown at the time in Gernany, and all available evidence seems to suggest that Herder reached a similar position quite independently. Vico is not mentioned by Herder before 1797; even then Herder seems to have been only superficially acquainted with his thought.</page><page sequence="10">290 F. M. BA1RNARD the constellation of values that animated it. Consequently-and this is impor- tant-facts could not be separated from values, if the significance of the former was to be understood.23 Recognition of the multiplicity of values necessarily implies the acceptance of their possible incompatibility. Herder never wished to deny this. He not only allowed for conflict, he even regarded it as natural, and warned against the dangers of suppressing it by coercive means.24 Tensions, antagonisms, and conflicts, Herder argues, must be accepted as the price of diversity. The full recognition, rather than the denial of their presence, affords the only possi- bility for their fruitful reconciliation. Underlying Herder's acceptance of polarity and diversity is his belief that there is inherent in all struggles and conflicts a tendency towards reconciliation. "Eventually these [the conflicting forces] contain and modify each other according to the infallible laws of nature and bring about a kind of equilibrium and harmony of movement."25 Such equilibrium, Herder is careful to point out, must not be seen as a ter- minal point or as the attainment of perfection in any absolute or lasting sense. Each generation must interpret its goals according to the "inner and outer circumstances" of its time, and hence must be prepared to face the challenge of new values and perspectives. Perfection cannot be achieved once and for all but has to be struggled for time and again within a given; historical con- text.26 The idea that human and social development must not be thought of as a smooth advance towards absolute and unchanging goals but rather as a dialectic process or a struggle towards ever-emerging ends, is an integral element in Herder's theory of progress. This was a novel idea and once again very much out of tune with the progressivist perfectionism that characterized the Age of Enlightenment. None the less, both Herder's theory of conflict and his doctrine of the plurality of values shared in some measure the Leibnizian optimism of the age. Just as he held that there was inherent in conflict a tendency towards equilibrium, so he also maintained that amidst infinite diversity there was a tendency "striving for a unity which lies in all things and which urges all things forward."27 On this theory, conflict and diversity are inherent in the natural order of things and hence their suppression is both futile and dangerous. Futile, because it can hardly hope to succeed in the long run; dangerous, because it forces dissatisfaction to simmer underground from where it can only surface by violent means. Instead of containing the area of conflict and abating its intensity, coercive devices only succeed in attaining a measure of consensus at the cost of ultimate self-destruction. Herder's insistence on the essentially positive and integrative function of conflict and diversity lends added force to his political conception of self-determination, which, as we have seen earlier, combines both the "negative" and the "positive" aspects of freedom. Thus Herder posits the absence of external political restraint as the necessary 23For more detailed discussion see my "Herder's Treatment of Causation and Continuity in History," Journal of the History of Ideas, XXIV (1963), 197-212. 24XVII, 119. 25XIV, 227. 26XIII, 196. 27XIII, 346; see also XIV, 227; XVI, 119, 551; XVII, 116; XVIII, 302, 408; XXIV, 375; and XXIX, 133, 139. This faith in the attainability of harmony between conflicting interests is by no means absent from modem pluralistic ideology.</page><page sequence="11">Metaphors, Laments, and the Organic Community 291 condition for the free and spontaneous unfolding of man's inner and creative powers in their infinite plurality and diversity. Given an atmosphere of political freedom, it is these inner powers which alone can be looked upon as the forces that make for unity amidst diversity.28 V In the light of the ideas we have just sketched it should not be difficult to see why Herder found the model of an organism more germane to his theory of community than that of a mechanism. Bent as he was on discovering forces (Kridfte) of social and political cohesion which would unite societies from within, Herder looked upon contemporary dynastic states as mere artifacts, lifeless assemblies of aggregates, the result of mechanical engineering. Whilst in a sense the parts of a mechanical assembly are as functionally related as those of an organism, their operation nevertheless depends on an external source of power. Furthermore, a mechanism is the product of manufacture, whereas an organism is the product of growth. Activity in the latter is self- generated; in the former it is not. A social and political whole resulting from organization imposed from outside, whilst it may qualify for recognition as a Gesellschaft, is none the less an artificial whole as compared to the Gemein- schaft bound together by the inner consciousness of sharing a common cultural heritage. Neither iron and blood nor political fiat and administrative manipula- tion can engender this inner consciousness which, according to Herder, alone sustains the existence and continuity of such a community, to which he applies the term Volk. A state can perish, but the Volk remains intact provided it retains the consciousness of its distinctive cultural traditions.29 We shlall reserve comment on Herder's lament over the "mechanical" political status quo of his time and on the vision of a Volk community to which it gave rise until we have contrasted his organic theory with that of his immediate "successors," the political Romanticists. At this point it would seem pertinent to enquire more closely into the nature of the organic model which Herder used as his heuristic construct. In particular we want to establish (a) how closely his organistic paradigm can be said to approximate an actual organism, and (b) to what extent the biological metaphors that Herder employed shed light on the ideas he wished to convey. It will help our enquiry to adduce here the distinction St. Thomas made between a substantial whole and an accidental whole.30 A composite, yet coherent substance, such as the human body, represents for him a substantial whole. An accidental whole, on the other hand, is not a thing or substance at 28llerder's arguments against enforced consensus in his essay, Vom Einfluss der Regierung auf die Wissenschaften, und der Wissenschaften auf die Regierung (The Reciprocal Influ- ence of Government and the Sciences) (1780), esp. IX, 354-62, go well beyond Milton's pleas in defence of freedom of expression in his Areopag,itica (1644) and anticipate those of J. S. Mill in his essay On Liberty. Likewise Herder's treatment of conflict significantly foreshadows modem theories, in particular those of Georg Simmel. 29XIV, 87. 30I am indebted on this point to Thomas Gilbey's Between Community and Society (Lon- don, 1953), esp. 113-23.</page><page sequence="12">292 F. M. BARNARD all, but rather (to use the terminology of psychology) a Gestalt, or configura- tion, contingent on the relation between the constituents forming it. A political community for St. Thomas is not a physical body or a unitary thing, and hence not a substantial whole. Its coherence and unity is contingent on the peculiar relationship of its members. It is they who are the substances. Men are not material particles forming a physical mass, but discrete individual entities. St. Thomas, in advancing his distinction between substantial and accidental wholes, is no less anxious than Aristotle was to point to the obvious difference between the concrete unity of a physical body and the discrete unity of the body politic. Herder, too, makes no attempt to conceal the difference between the organic unity of a physical whole and that of a social whole. His conception of a social organism closely corresponds to St. Thomas's accidental whole or to Aristotle's notion of the state as a composite. The Volk community is an organic whole by virtue of the peculiar inter-relationship of its members which alone confers upon it a Gestalt of its own, a unity sui generis. Indeed, in order to underline the composite nature of a social whole, Herder speaks not in terms of a single organism, but rather in terms of a complex of organisms, each of which is an active whole in itself comparable to the Leibnizian monad. Unlike the Leibnizian monad, however, the Herderian monad has windows. This is an important qualification. For though the individual units of the whole are distinct entities, deriving their source of activity from within, they are none the less considered by Herder as being not wholly self-contained but interconnected. What is more, the nature of their interconnection is not that of an extemal link, but rather embodies an internal propensity towards inter- connection and interaction with other units.Y In the case of a Volk, the decisive interconnecting link is the consciousness of a shared social culture and historical tradition. A Volk, accordingly, is not a substantive entity in any biological sense, a thing with a corporate existence of its own over and above, or separate from, the individuals who compose it, but a relational event, a historical and cultural continuum. An individuals consciousness of belonging to a distinct community, likewise, is not a biological fact, but a derivative social and cultural process, the result of the continuous interaction that is taking place between the selfs "inside" and "outside." The individual, far from being enclosed within himself or genetically constituted to be a German, or Italian, or Canadian a priori, derives the awareness of himself as a member of a particular national community from the social milieu into which he is born, from his contact with the world around him.32 What is more, and this too is of crucial significance, Herder's holism com- prises multiplicity and diversity as well as unity. Indeed, uniqueness and diversity are posited as the necessary condition for interaction and inter- relation between constituents of a social whole. That the social realm, no less than the world of nature, consists of inter-related and interacting organisms, each of which is necessary to the whole, is the principal notion of Herder's 31XXI, 182. Herder's philosophy of organism is most coherently developed in the Metakritik (1799), a study that was intended as a criticism of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. 32XXI, 152.</page><page sequence="13">Metaphors, Laments, and the Organic Community 293 theory of social organism. It clearly reflects his concem to forge a synthesis between the individualist ideology of the Enlightenment and his own philo- sophy of community. In spite of Herder's use of biological similes, his main purpose was to identify socio-cultural traits which could form the basis for the existence and continuity of a distinct community. It was not in racial characteristics or in physical factors based on heredity that he saw the determinants of a Volk, but in language, literary traditions, folklore, and folksongs, and the numerous traditional customs which Sumner later called the "folkways" of a people. Herder wished to emphasize that for a political community to be an organic social whole that would endure in time, it had to be the result of spontaneous growth out of, and within, a specific cultural environment. Although he applied biological terms like "genetic" and "organic" to this process of growth, he did not really think of it in a biological sense. He held the transmission of social cultures to be genetic because Bildung (i.e., education in the widest sense) made it possible to link a Volk's cultural heritage from one generation to another, and organic by virtue of the manner in which it was assimilated and creatively re-applied.33 The very fact that he explicitly identifies this process of transmission as a spiritual genesis34 leaves no doubt whatsoever that Herder's paradigm of the organically integrated community-which he opposed to the mechanistic model of the bureaucratic state-was, to use Werner Stark's classification, in essence a normative rather than a positive form of organicism.35 It is also of interest to observe that in his choice of biological metaphors Herder nowhere stipulates a subordinate organic relationship such as that of a leaf to the tree, or of a limb to the human body, for this reveals a remarkable degree of consistency between his imagery and his idea of functional co-ordination which is central to his advocacy of a non-hierarchical co-operative form of social pluralism. VI The organismic concept of growth is commonly associated with political conseivatism. Most conservative political thinkers, particularly since Burke, invoked organism in their defence of the status quo and in their warnings against the dangers of radical changes based on rational principles. Burke, however, seems to have shown greater insight than some of his followers in recognizing the limits of the growth concept as a rationale for conservatism. It is no accident that Burke, after making ample rhetorical use of the metaphor of organic growth when dealing with the British constitution up to the beginning of his own century, makes much less use of it when dealing with contemporary institutions. Growth was good imagery for the formative period of the constitution; it had little relevance to the finished or virtually finished product, or, to use biological terms, to something that had attained the stage of maturity. For Burke the British constitution had grown up; it had reached maturity. To have pursued the organismic imagery beyond this point would necessarily have implied either that maturity had not really been achieved or 33XII, 346-8. 34XIV, 84. 35Stark, Fundamental Forms of Social Thought, chaps. ns and nI.</page><page sequence="14">294 F. M. BARNARD that decay had already set in. Neither implication would have been palatable to Burke, since he was convinced that only slight changes, if any, were desirable in the case of so perfect an instrument as the British constitution. Not change, but preservation and permanence were the chief desiderata. Burke, therefore, as far as the present and future were concemed, felt no compunction in abandoning biological imagery in favour of mechanical imagery, in particular the imagery of architecture. Buildings suggested greater durability than organisms. There was infinitely more scope for keeping build- ings in a state of good repair and thus for prolonging their lives almost indefinitely than there was for preventing the decay and death of living things. Repair, not change, was the operative notion of Burke's political philosophy. When he did make use of the concept of growth, he certainly did not imply a process of continuing change or progress.36 Herder, too, preferred "gradual, natural, reasonable evolution" to revolu- tion.37 Yet he saw this gradual evolution, which he identified with growth, in terms of continuing change. Philosophical considerations apart-Herder's philosophy of history considered continuous change and development as the very essence of time-there were good political reasons for the different interpretation and use of the organismic metaphor of growth in Herder's, as distinct from Burke's, political vocabulary. Unlike Burke, Herder found little in his country's political institutions worth preserving. His traditionalism, therefore, could not dispense with the idea of progress. If social and political life had so far failed to emerge in a form that befitted the nature of man, it was because, so Herder argued, the process of development had been artificially arrested. Traditions had become warped because growth was denied to them. Instead of opposing tradition and progress, Herder regarded both as interdependent variables in the process of socio-political development. One without the other had only a shadow existence. Progress, to have real and enduring significance, had to be a concomitant of social growth; it had to emerge out of a given social tradition. Without tradition, progress was like a plant without roots.38 Conversely, a living tradition was inconceivable without the progressive emergence of new goals. If progress without tradition was like a plant without roots, tradition without progress was like a plant without water. Indeed, Herder describes such stagnant traditionalism as a real opium of the spirit and as the death-knell of states and individuals alike.39 In this conjunction of progress and tradition Herder's ability to reconcile apparent opposites again comes into play. We have seen how he attempted to forge a synthesis between individualism and his own philosophy of community. Similarly, he tried to fuse the prevalent progressivist ideology of the age with his own traditionalism. That such a fusion should be possible and, indeed, plausible, suggests that the association commonly made between the organic HLove, "Burke's Idea of the Body Corporate," 187. 87XVIII, 332. 38XIII, 347. 39XIV, 89. This view has recently been expressed in similar words by George Grant in his lament over the supposed demise of the Canadian nation. "A nation," Grant writes "does not remain a nation only because it has roots in the past. Memory is never enough to guarantee that a nation can articulate itself in the present. There must be a thrust of inten- tion into the future." Lament for a Nation (Toronto, Montreal, 1965), 12.</page><page sequence="15">Metaphors, Laments, and the Organic Community 295 growth metaphor and political conservatism is more tenuous than has been supposed. It also suggests, perhaps even more significantly, that there is no necessary connection between traditionalism and conservatism. VII Unlike Burke's static, and Herder's progressivist, conception of tradition, the orientation of the political Romanticists was distinctly reactionary, in the most literal sense of this much-abused word.40 Disenchanted with the results of the French Revolution, they saw the best hope for mankind in a return to the type of society which they associated with the Middle Ages. In their craving for order and stability they projected into the past what they most fervently desired in the here-and-now. The French Revolution, they held, was but the climax of a process of social atomization which could be traced in its origins to the destruction of the values, groups, and institutions of the mediaeval epoch, an epoch in which every person, every belief and custom, were inseparably related elements in a tightly knit social system. The Middle Ages, in short, provided for the Romanticists the model of an organic com- munity in which, in contrast to the Enlightenment, the social group, and not the individual, was the irreducible unit of society, and in which social order rather than individual freedom constituted the most basic and inspirational value animating society. nTe political Romanticists have often been acclaimed as followers of Herder, and it cannot be denied that a number of their ideas derived from Herderian sources. The sympathetic treatment of the Middle Ages (which hitherto had been dismissed as a dark and barbarian era); the viewing of history as a force no less powerful and real than that of nature; the notion of the unique- ness of creative activity within a specific context of time and place; the organic wholeness of social cultures; the denial of Natural Law, of social contract, and of a pre-political state of nature; the afflrmation of language as the most vital source of a people's collective consciousness: all these are ideas which the political Romanticists shared with Herder. These shared ideas have undoubtedly led commentators to identify closely the political thought of the Romanticists with that of Herder and even to hold him responsible for the different forms of perversion which Romanticism has undergone.4' Such close identification not only blurs some important distinctions in political emphasis, but indeed is apt to obscure the very substance of the matter involved in each 40AIthough political Romanticism did not represent a solid and unified ideology, the features that we shall single out for discussion were common to the views of most leading represen- tatives of this school. The men we chiefly have in mind here are Novalis, the brothers Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel, Adam Miller, Schleiermacher, and Savigny in Germany, Bonald, Lamennais, and De Maistre in France, and Coleridge in England. 41See, for example, R. G. Collingwood, The Idea of History (Oxford, 1946), 86-92; K. R. Popper, The Open Society and its Enemies, 2nd ed. (London, 1952), II, 52; H. S. Reiss, The Political Thought of the German Romantics (1793-1815) (Oxford, 1955), 2 and 8; Max Rouche, La Philosophie de l'Histoire de Herder (Paris, 1940), 554; or (approvingly) Benno von Wiese, Volk und Dichtung von Herder bis zur Romantik (Erlangen, 1938), 18 and his "Der Gedanke des Volkes in Herders Weltbild," Die Erziehung (1939), 121 and 137.</page><page sequence="16">296 F. M. BARNARD case. This should become more evident as we review the metaphorical imagery employed by the political Romanticists. Because of their almost compulsive obsession with the Middle Ages the Romanticists preferred to think of their ideal community structure in strictly hierarchical terms. Herder's notion of pluralism was not abandoned, but transmuted. In place of Herder's novel conception of co-operative pluralism within the context of an essentially undifferentiated society (undifferentiated in the vertical sense), the Romanticists put the much older notion of functional subordination. In contrast to Herder's advocacy of multiple affiliations, where individuals can move between, and belong to, a diversity of groups, the Romanticists revived the mediaeval notion of social immobility and of the total and exclusive submission of a member to a single group. Metaphorically this divergence from the Herderian community model is reflected in the Romanticists' return to a wholly anthropomorphic image of organism. The State, said Novalis, was a macro-anthropos, the anatomy of which was com- posed of the different social orders that formed a polity. The guilds were its limbs and the source of its physical strength, the nobility represented the moral element, the priests the religious, the teachers the intellectual, whilst the king embodied its will.42 According to such a conception of the body politic, the inequality of "social orders" is a necessary presupposition and obedience and subordination natural corollaries. Some men were born to rule and others destined to serve; each had to perform the role that Providence had assigned to him. Obedience to authority does not degrade. On the contrary, there is joy in obedience.43 The soul craves for elevation in voluntary surrender; it finds freedom in complete submission to the fatherland.44 The land-owning nobility was generally identified with the natural ruling class and favourably contrasted with commerce and trade as the most reliable custodian of order and stability.45 Not obedience, but disobedience, was degrading and the most common source of alienation. As man moves away from order, anguish presses around him. He is the king of his own misery, a degraded sovereign in revolt against himself, without duties, without bounds, without society.46 Allied with this glorification of the mediaeval social structure was a some- what incongruous notion, the idea of the supremacy and all-pervasiveness of the state. The state was represented as an all-embracing organic whole, outside which human existence was wholly inconceivable. Adam Muller spoke of the state as the interest of all interests, as the supreme end, and as the totality of all human affairs. Man entirely belonged to the state, in mind and in body and with all his earthly possessions. It was not, therefore, for man to question the purpose of the state, for to do so implied that there was a purpose beyond 42Novalis, Werke (ed. Carl Seelig, 5 vols., Zurich, 1945), IV, 158; see also II, 193: "The State is a person like any individual"; and similarly III, 298. 43Novalis, ibid., V, 32-3. 44Adam Muller, Elemente der Staatskunst (3 vols., Berlin, 1809), III, 327. 45See, for exanmple, S.

Nisbet, "Conservatism and Sociology," American Journal of Sociology, LVIII (1952-53), 170.</page><page sequence="17">Metaphors, Laments, and the Organic Community 297 the state which it should serve-a utilitarian notion too despicable even to contemplate.47 The state was not simply an institution serving particular material needs; rather it was an idea outside and beyond the sphere of ordinary empirical experience. Thus Muller, writing before Hegel, conceived of the state as the extremely moving realm of ideas.48 For Schleiermacher the monarch was the embodiment of the divine idea of the state.49 Like Muller he also denied the validity of a utilitarian or empirical justification of the state, judging it to be beyond definition because it was entirely beyond the grasp of the logical or empirical processes of the mind. Indeed Muller went so far as to regard this inherent indefinability as the most profound and distinctive hallmark of the state.50 By endowing the state with a mystique and transcend- ance of its own the Romanticists wished to distinguish it from all other forms of human organization, as something ontologically unique and superior. VIII Admittedly, on logical and theoretical grounds, the Romanticist conception of functional subordination may be claimed to be as valid as Herder's conception of functional co-ordination, for both conceptions are compatible with the image of an organism. One may, of course, legitimately question the adequacy of the organic analogy in either conception as a description or explanation of social and political structures. But the point at issue here is whether the diverse claims made by the political Romanticists for the political community do not involve an almost absurd overextension of the metaphor originally chosen. Clearly, when we think of an organism we do not think of the whole as being on an ontologically higher level than its parts. The political Romanti- cists, on the other hand, maintained both: (a) that the political community is an organism; and (b) that it is on an ontologically higher level than its members. And they seemed to think that the first statement entailed the second, or more precisely, they invariably argued as if the two claims were identical. Similarly, it does not follow from the analogy of organism that the state cannot be conceived in an instrumental sense. One can legitimately hold the state to be an organism (or, rather, like an organism), without holding also that it is an end in itself. Conversely, one can legitimately uphold the belief that the state is something final, in the nature of an absolute in some metaphysical or transcendental sense, without committing oneself to the view that the state is an organism. There simply is no necessary connection between these two beliefs. 47Miiller, Elemente, I, 62-8; II, 85. See also Novalis, Werke, IV, 225 and 274. 48Miller, Elemente, I, 63. In speaking of the state as an idea, Muller wished to distinguish it from a concept. The latter, he held, was susceptible to rational analysis; the former was not. For concepts refer to purely static conditions, to the composition of events at any particular point of time. Ideas, on the other hand, refer to dynamic phenomena, to objects that "move and grow." To gain true knowledge of the state, therefore, the analytical method of the sciences is wholly out of place. What is required is not observation, classifi- cation, the construction of hypotheses and the formulation of definitions, but direct intuitive insight. (See Muller, Elemente, I, 20.) 49F.

BARNARD A further confusion arises from the Romanticists' attempt to identify the image of an organism with that of a person. For not only is the unity of a person a wholly different conception from that of the unity of an organism; it is also difficult to see how one can speak of the parts of a person. One may conceivably argue that the state is an organism made up of other co-ordinate organisms (as Herder did) or of subordinate organisms (as the Romanticists did), but it is more difficult to understand how one can maintain that the state as a person is made up of other or lesser persons. Although both the organic model and the model of a person may or may not be regarded as methodologically fruitful devices for political analysis, nothing but confusion can result from the mixing or identification of these two models.51 Finally, even if it is conceded that in terms of the organic model the parts can only be explained in reference to the whole, this does not imply that their value is derivative from the value of the whole. For clearly, ethically speaking, the members of a social whole may be more or less valuable than the whole, or of equal value. Again Herder, in contrast to the Romanticists, seems to have recognized this point by upholding the notions of both Volk and Humanitdt as equally relevant value considerations.52 In the light of these observations one may wonder whether the political organism of the Romanticists was not essentially a pseudo-organism. By making the sort of claims for the state which they did, they both distorted and obscured the image of organism as a political model. Herder, by refraining from associating such claims with the organic model, was in this sense a more consistent organicist than his Romanticist "followers." What is more, by insisting on functional co-ordination rather than subordination, on multiple rather than single group membership, he also suggested the possibility of an organic community theory that was both democratic and pluralistic.53 Whereas the Romanticists looked upon the state as a unified organism from the outset, the organic unity of Herder's political image was that of a relational process of development in which diverse interests would partake freely and equally (in terms of socio-political status and opportunity) in order to find a basis for aggreement and co-operation. It was a matter of 51I feel indebted here to H. J. McCloskey's article "The State as an Organism," Philoso- phical Review (July 1963), 309-24. 52For Herder neither the nation or Volk, nor the nation-state, has an exclusive claim on man's loyalty. It is the very task of Bildung to reconcile patriotism with a respect for man- kind at large, with Humanitdt. Herder's "cateporical imperative" decrees: "Serve the State, if you must, but serve humanity if you can' (XIII, 456). Herder decisively repudiates national chauvinism and treats with the utmost contempt the belief that any one nation can claim superiority over another. There is no such thing as a "historical nation" (as Hegel would have it) for Herder. No nation can claim to be a Favoritvolk at any time (XVIII, 248). "There must be no order of rank: . . . the Negro is as much entitled to think the white man degenerate as the white man is to think of the Negro as a black beast" (ibid.). The idea of master-nations or master-races simply has no meaning for him. (See XIII, 252, 257, and XVII, 115.) Herder's distaste for the very concept of race provoked a rather severe stricture from Kant who castigated him for his "inadequate and unsympa- thetic treatment of race" (Kant's review of the Ideen in the Allgemeine Literaturzeitung of 15 Nov. 1785). 53The contrast between the Herderian and the Romanticists' approach to the problem of "cmass society" can be seen to parallel the distinction which William Kornhauser makes between the democratic and the aristocratic critique of mass society in The Politics of Mass Society (New York, 1959).</page><page sequence="19">Metaphors, Laments, and the Organic Community 299 potential unity seeking realization, not of actual, let alone enforced, unity. The political structure of Herder's model state was conceived on anarcho- pluralistic lines. There is no single focus of power, for government is not vested in any one permanent administrative body. Government must be impersonal and non-physical if it is not to be a burden upon a healthy community. The institution of a centralizing power constitutes for Herder not the beginning but the collapse of politics; it is the symptom of social decay and political bankruptcy.54 Herder's Volk-state is a territorial unit in which men conscious of sharing a common socio-cultural heritage are free to order their lives within a legal framework of their own making. It is the area of a nation's political self-determination and the social framework within which various sectional bodies and associations operate and co-operate. Government is virtually reduced (or elevated) to co-operation or, more precisely, to "joint endeavour" (Zusammenwirken) . Herder believed such a social and political order to be attainable without a breach of historical continuity, because he envisaged the political process in terms of a gradual evolution of two complementary, yet opposing, tendencies: decay from above (the aristocratic power elite) and growth from below (increasing popular participation). He was realistic enough, however, to recognize that growth from below was not a necessary corollary of decay from above. Hence he stressed the need for a transitional period of Bildung in which popular leaders-to which he applied the term "aristo-democrats"- would help all members of the nation to achieve that degree of political maturity which would render their further leadership dispensable.50 In this Herder saw the ultimate goal of the transformation from aristocratic to popular rule, from tutelage to self-determination. This ultimate stage was to witness the disappearance of the state as an administrative machine, and its replacement by a pluralist diffusion of government associated with Herder's concept of "nomocracy," under which spontaneous "joint endeavour" and "self-determination" would render all forms of coercion obsolete and superfluous.57 Ix In his repudiation of central bureaucratic control Herder certainly under- estimated the need for co-ordination of the diverse elements of his pluralist 54Herder's insistence on the diffusion of power between diverse sectional bodies and inter- ests is in marked contrast to Rousseau's open hostility to any form of pluralism. Since Herder has at times been called "the German Rousseau" (see, e.g., H. A. Korff, Geist der Goethezeit (Leipzig, 1923), I, 74), this point is not without interest. It is indeed remark- able how consistent Herder was in his hostility to the institution of central administrative bodies. For he opposed it on both the national and international level. Herder did not recommend the abolition of nation states in favour of the creation of a world government, since he believed that even the mere attempt to institute such an international organization would exacerbate rather than reduce international tension. Whilst aiming to unite people, it would actually divide them further. Such "utopian phantoms" only deceive people into thinking that international unity was merely a matter of political organization (see XVII, 125; XVIII, 283, 346). a5XIV, 227. 56See XIII, 149 and XVIII, 339. 57XIV, 217.</page><page sequence="20">300 F. M. BARNARD scheme, just as he failed to realize that consciousness alone without procedural machinery may not be effective enough to provide for the political cohesion required in so large a community as the nation. Similarly, he may have misjudged the future trend of even the smallest or the most populist organi- zations which, according to most modem political sociologists, invariably come to reveal oligarchic and hierarchical tendencies. In these respects Herder may rightly be said to have failed to qualify as a precursor of modern political nationalism no less than as a precursor of modem political socialism. But to grant this is not to deny the originality of his political ideas nor to justify their neglect by students of political and sociological thought. Admittedly Herder's socialist ideas were closer to "utopians" such as Proudhon or Kropotkin than to "realists" such as Lenin or Stalin, just as his nationalist ideas were closer to those of Mazzini and Masaryk than to those of Hegel or Bismarck. But this fact need not necessarily deprive them of relevance to those peoples and states which are still searching for forms of socialism and nationalism other than those which have emerged hitherto.58 None the less, it should be emphasized that Herder's paradigm of the organically integrated community was essentially a normative model. As such, it undoubtedly has its use as a heuristic device for judging the nature and degree of socio-political cohesion in actual states. But it has its dangers as well. The concept of power may be irrelevant to a theory which views society as the outcome of historical growth and as a -network of spontaneous co-operative activities and shared cultural traditions. Yet when actual conditions widely diverge from those envisioned by Herder's community theory, the application of his political terminology may disguise the realities of power politics and deceive people into thinking that political matters are indistinguishable from artistic and metaphysical concerns where power is not involved. The extent of this danger has been amply illustrated by the diverse expres- sions of twentieth century totalitarianism. It was already incipient, I would suggest, in the community theories of the political Romanticists. This view, I am aware, can be challenged. It may undoubtedly be argued that, by opposing the atomization of society into what is commonly referred to as mass society, the political Romanticists revived the belief in the importance of intermediary groups as buffers between the omnipotent Leviathan and the individual citizen. By possessing an independent group life within diverse associations, non-elites, it may be maintained with some plausibility, are less accessible to the manipulation of elites. But what can less plausibly be maintained is that a theory which lays as much stress on the hierarchy of status as the Romanticist theory of community did leaves enough scope for autonomous groups to serve as effective brakes upon central autocracy, especially if such a theory is overlaid-as it frequently was-with transcendental images of the state that confer upon it an absolute pre-eminence over every other form of social organization. It would therefore seem that the Romanticists' conception of pluralism was as much out of keeping with the notion of social pluralism as 581t is of interest that recent thinking on administrative processes come significantly close to Herder's notion of co-ordination free from norns of centrality and hierarchy. See, for example, Charles E. Lindblom, The Intelligence of Democracy: Decision Making through Mutual Adjustment (New York, 1965), 293-310.</page><page sequence="21">Metaphors, Laments, and the Organic Community 301 it is commonly understood today as was their image of organism with that of a social whole or body politic. Even if it is conceded that the Romanticists were imbued with a Christian ethos and that they cherished the hope that those who govern would do so with a paternal concern for the governed, it none the less remains true that they allied this faith and hope with a complete trust in the rulers to be the infallible arbiters of what was best for the ruled. In effect, therefore, if not necessarily in intention, their political theories came to provide a basic ideological sanction for authoritarian, if not totalitarian, forms of government. Some of the most reactionary Romanticists were at the time of the French Revolution its most enthusiastic supporters. Herder did not live to witness the events that followed in its wake. The Romanticists whose views we outlined in the previous pages did. They became reactionaries not because they favoured absolutism-many in fact opposed it-but because they felt betrayed by the principles in which they had placed their trust. Their lament over the gods that failed kindled their post-Revolutionary faith in the idols of the past. Disillusioned over the eagerly hoped-for reform from below, they reverted to the belief that political initiative could only be expected from above, and what is more, that it could only be effective if it was glorified and invested with mystique. x It is beyond the scope of this essay to assess the validity of the laments underlying the community theories we have traced. Terms such as "mass society" and "alienation" have by now acquired such strong emotional over- tones that their cognitional status has been seriously impaired. They have become rhetorical cliches, if not outright myths, and as such are of diminishing value to scientific analysis. It yet remains to be demonstrated that the "forces" alleged to have brought in their train the alienation of man, from himself no less than fromn his community roots, have not also brought about his liberation from servitude to community traditions and customs. The men of the En- lightenment, indeed, believed implicitly in such liberation, but the truth may (as it so often does) lie between these two extremes. It was the merit of Herder and the political Romanticists to have caught the first-albeit partial- glimpses of this possibility. As with all "might-have-beens," it is no doubt futile to speculate what the course of the history of ideas and events in the realm of politics would have been had the political Romanticists adopted and further developed Herder's organic image of community. As it was, his political legacy found no immediate heirs. What seems less fanciful, however, is to suggest that Herder's ingenious attempts to resolve dichotomies commonly thought to be irrevocably opposed to each other-the liberal stress on the self-governing individual versus the conservative stress on the group as the basic unit of society; uniqueness versus generalization; fact versus value; conservation and tradition versus change and the progressive emergence of new goals; nationalism versus intemationalism-have lost none of their challenge and interest for current discussions in politics and sociology.</page></plain_text>
