<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARA PACIS AUGUSTAE. (Plates IV and V). By ALBERT W. VAN BUREN. It is my purpose in this article 1 to discuss the interpretation of the relief from the Ara Pacis, now in the Uffizi Gallery, which is traditionally known as the " Tellus relief " (plate IV) 2. The most recent detailed discussion of the Ara Pacis is the monograph of F. Studniczka,3 which marks a considerable advance on previous work. Studniczka shows that the west door was flanked by two reliefs having to do with legendary figures of Italic or Roman history; to the south, Aeneas sacrificing, and to the north, Mars gazing on the wolf and twins; while the east door was flanked to the south by the so-called " Tellus," facing right, and to the north by a relief representing Roma and secondary figures, facing left. That the west end was the front of the structure is made clear by the fact that the figures of the north and south sides are facing in that direction. 4 It will be well to examine first the evidence as to identification afforded by the " Tellus " relief itself, and then to discuss it in its relation to the monument as a whole. The traditional identification as " Tellus "' 5 has imposed itself on observers almost without exception from Renaissance times to the present 6; and the feeling which has prompted this is easy to appreciate. This glorified personification of maternity, with the children in her embrace, in the midst of flowers and fruits and animals, flanked by the embodiments of the benign action of the elements, appeals with force to the modern mind as surely none other than 1 Mr. H. Stuart Jones and Professor F. Studniczka have placed me under obligation to them by valuable criticism and suggestions in connexion with this article. 2 The restored portions of the relief are numerous, but do not affect the evidence discussed in this article. They are indicated in Schreiber, Die hellenistischen Reliefbilder, taf. xxxii, a, and enumerated, somewhat differently, by Petersen, A.PA.A P- 49, n.

(4, f.) contains a bibliography. 4 The choice of the east end for representation on the coins of the time of Nero may have been due to its having become more familiar to the populace as seen from the Via Lata. 5 See the discussion in Petersen, A.P.A. pp. 49-54, and Studniczka, Z.A.P. p. 929 (3i). 6 Gardthausen's identification as Pax " has not met with general acceptance. My own chief objections to it are: (i) a representation of " Pax," if introduced at the point in question, would destroy the symmetry of the composition of the frieze; (z) the details of the group under dis- cussion are indicative of the personification of a geographical entity; see below.</page><page sequence="2">THE ARA PACIS AUGUSTAE. I35 Mother Earth, the source of fruitfulness and growth among plants, animals and men. I feel, however, that the very potency and directness of the appeal which this interpretation of the relief makes to our emotions has caused us to forget the existence, in the literature of the Augustan age, of another personification, which to the con- temporary Romans was more direct in its appeal, and was capable of arousing more profound feelings of reverence and affection. It is obvious that neither the matronly character of the figure, nor the two children, nor the animals and flowers and fruits, are sufficient in themselves to establish the identification as " Tellus." A concept such as " Fecunditas " can be represented on the coins by a matronly figure with children; and on the other hand various geographical entities such as countries can be indicated in a similar fashion. On a silver cup from Boscorealel is reprQsented the protome of a female figure, holding cornucopiae and flowers and fruits, and associated with a lion and a pantheress; other details identify her as Egypt or Alexandria.2 This instance is sufficient to suggest the possibility that the figure on the Ara Pacis, which has a number of features in common with the protome on the cup, belongs to the same general class of representations. In the study of Hellenistic and Roman imperial art, too little attention has been paid to the important subject which I have called elsewhere3 " the personification of geographical entities ": we have not accustomed ourselves sufficiently to interpreting the indications of topographical situation in the precise way in which they were intended by the artists and understood by their con- temporaries. In many of these personifications there is a mingling of the original nature of the object personified with the human mould in which the personification has been cast. There is a category including Tellus and rivers, in which, owing to the fact that in the mind of the artist either the elemental nature or the spatial extension of the object personified is of more weight than the anthropomorphic character of the personification, the figure is with almost unvarying regularity represented either as rising up out of its material self, or as outstretched in a more or less recumbent posture.4 Again, there is the other category, including cities and countries, in which the concept of spatial extension and that of elemental nature yield to the anthropomorphic tendency and are to a considerable extent latent, or in which these characteristics were never strongly felt. These two classes of representations can be sharply distinguished from such absolutely anthropomorphic. conceptions as Ceres and Oikumene, which belong to a different IIllustrated in Monuments Piot, v (1899), pl. . 2 The pantheic symbols in the field naturally do not affect the above identification. 3 Journal ofRoman Studies, i (I9I i), p.

It is to the first of these categories that the great majority of the representations of Tellus in Roman art belong. Leaving aside the relief which forms the subject of this article, and the similar relief from Carthage, the only exception to the rule of which I know is the statuette, found in its aedicula in the Campo Verano in I872, 1 and identified as "Terra Mater" by an inscription on the aedicula. In this instance, the variation from the usual mode of representation is due to the exigencies of a statuette in the round, to which the traditional type, though admirable for relief composition, proved ill adapted; and to the readiness of the artist to avail himself of a Greek type associated with Demeter, in other words, to represent Mother Earth as completely anthropo- morphic, rather than as partly elemental., The statuette from the Campo Verano, unique as it is, should warn us not to exclude the possibility that the artist of the Ara Pacis also, even though working in relief, might have conceivably adopted the Greek type of Ge Kourotrophos for representing the Earth Mother. If the figure from the Ara Pacis, however, represents " Tellus," we should expect at least to find some indication of this among the accessories of the group. On the Gemma Augustea, 2 the reclining matronly personage with the cornucopiae and two children at the extreme right of the upper band of figures is identified as Tellus by the propinquity of the personification either of the sky or of the sea. And on the breastplate of the statue of Augustus from Prima Porta, 3 the reclining matronly figure at the bottom is identified, not so much by the cornucopiae and two children, which in them- selves are ambiguous, as by the presence, to the left and right above the figure in question, of personifications of the sun and moon, and still higher, in the zenith, of the personified dawn just below the personified heavens. Now, if we turn to the relief of the Ara Pacis, we at once observe that the indications there given are essentially different in character from those which we have found on the gem and the statue; in fact all those which in the former instances were conclusive for purposes of identification are lacking on the Ara Pacis. Here the figure is not reclining, but is seated on rocks, facing the sea, which is indicated by the waves and the figure astride the sea creature. She holds two children, symbolical of fecundity; the wreath with which her hair is bound, the fruits in her lap, and the flowers and foliage springing up about her, indicate various forms of vegetation and suggest the culture of the vine 1 Bull.

By her flows a river, along the course of which graze or recline the representatives of flocks and herds ; behind her is the personification of the beneficent influences of light and air, as exerted on the land ; the swan, the bird of Venus, recalls to the mind the exordium of Lucretius's great poeml; while the attitude of the central figure, facing the sea as she is seated on the mountains, implies both reliance on the resources of a mountainous country and interest in maritime affairs. While there is nothing in all this that excludes an identification with " Tellus," still to the con- temporaries of Augustus, familiar as they were with their poets' glorification of Italy, there was much in the aspect and surroundings of this majestic yet tender nurse, placed as a counterpart to the stately figure of the proud warrior-maiden Roma, which might lead them to feel that this figure, seated on the mountains beside a river and looking out to sea, this mother of men who is also mistress of flocks and fruits and flowers, favoured by the breezes of sea and sky, is the embodiment of the Saturnian land, the goddess Italia. A comparison with the well-known glorification of Italy in Virgil, Georgics, ii, I36-I76, discloses a close parallelism between the two masterpieces of Augustan art and literature. Naturally the poet and the sculptor went about their task each in his own way: there are many things expressed in Virgil's verse which the sculptor had to omit, or at best could only imply; but, notwithstanding the fundamental difference in the mediums used, the following parallels can be drawn: Virgil: 1. I43: . . . gravidae fruges et Bacchi Massicus humor. Ara Pacis: Wreath ; fruit in lap ; flowers and other vegetation in front of and behind the main figure, and near the urn. Virgil: . I44: . .. armentaque laeta. ii. I46, f. . . albi, Clitumne, greges, et maxima taurus Victima, saepe tuo perfusi flumine sacro. Ara Pacis: River flowing from urn; by it, bull and sheep. Virgil: 1. 149 . . . ver assiduum atque alienis mensibus aestas. Ara Pacis: Flowers in full bloom. I I am inclined also to interpret the swans, which are conspicuous among the foliage adorning the exterior podium of the monument, as an allusion to Venus rather than to Apollo.</page><page sequence="5">I38 THE ARA PACIS AUGUSTAE. Virgil: 11. i56, f Tot congesta manu praeruptis oppida saxis, Fluminaque antiquos subterlabentia muros. AIra Pacis: The principal figure is seated on rocks ; past her flows the river. Virgil: 1. I58: . . . mare, quod . . . adluit infra. Ara Pacis: The sea is indicated to the right. Virgil: 1. i6i portus Ara Pacis: The position of the main figure, facing the sea, indicates interest in maritime affairs. Virgil: 11. I73, f: Salve magna parens frugum, Saturnia tellus, Magna virum. Jra Pacis: Fruits, flowers, and two children. The confronting of the relief from the Ara Pacis with the passage in Virgil is, I believe, equivalent to a demonstration that the matronly figure there represented is susceptible of identification with Italia. Except perhaps for the wreath encircling the head, the artist has not followed any of the traditional representations of Italia, as they appear on the coins, but has preferred to adapt for his purpose the old Greek type of Ge Kourotrophos; and that it really is Italia, and not Tellus, that is represented, is rendered probable by another consideration. The similar relief from Carthage, now in the Louvre, (plate v) while practically identical as regards the central portion, differs in the two side figures. In place of what I have taken to be the personification of the fertilising influences of the land to the left and the personification of the sea to the right, the Carthage relief has, to the left, a draped female figure, with veil, holding a torch in her left hand, and to the right, a male figure, in agitated posture, in the midst of troubled waves. Now as to the question of the mutual relation of these two reliefs, opinions have differed. Personally, I agree with Studniczka,1 who considers the Carthage relief to be derived from that of the Ara Pacis. There is reason2 to believe that in various cities of the empire altars were erected to Pax Augusta, presumably not long after the date of the erection of the altar in the capital, repro- 1 Z.A.P. p. 930 (32). 2cf.

I39 ducing some at least of the decorative features of that monument. Thus at Praenestel1 the decuriones populusque coloniae Praenestin(ae) erected to Paci Jugust(ae) " ara marmorea eleganter sculpta, ornata capitibus arietinis, a quibus pendent encarpia " ; and at Narbo 2 a certain T. Domitius Romulus erected an altar to Paci Aug. decorated partly with laurel, oak, and a shield, details which are presumably reminiscent of well-known Augustan monuments in Rome, an(d partly with " sertum quernum duobus bucraniis ornatum," apparently copied from the Roman Ara Pacis. It is probable that in some similar way the Carthage relief is a survival from a local Ara Pacis, reproducing more fully than the examples I have mentioned the details of its prototype, and copying the motive of that particular group which forms the subject of the present article, with variations, the reason for which will be discussed below.3 Granting that the above hypothesis as to the relation of the Roman and Carthaginian reliefs wins acceptance, opinions doubtless will still differ as to the degree of originality which is to be clainmed for the relief on the Roman Ara Pacis; in other words, whether the group represents an original conception of the Augustan artist (to be precise, whether he was the first to use the old Greek type of Ge Kourotrophos in this modified form in relief composition), or whether it is not rather a repetition of a Hellenistic motive. It is obvious that in the latter case the prototype of the central figure was not designed to represent Italia. But this problem, important as it is in itself, is not essential to the matter which we are discussing, namely, the interpretation of the relief from the Ara Pacis, for which it is immaterial whether the artist invented a new composition or adapted to his own use the invention of a predecessor. What, however, is of direct importance to us is to observe how the two extant reliefs differ from each other, and to see how this variation is best explained, The variation in the secondary figures suggests as its concomitant a variation in the signification of the central figure. In other words, one at least of the reliefs in question is a special adaptation to local conditions. Examining the relief from Carthage, and endeavouring to give it a topographical interpretation, one will observe that the central figure may well be the personified Africa, vwho could be introduced in the decoration of a Carthaginian Ara Pacis with the same degree of propriety, from the standpoint of the provincials, as the Italia had been introduced on the Roman altar ; and that the I C.I.L. xiv, z898. 2 C.I.L. xii, 4335. 3 I am indebted to Professor Studniczka for the suggestion incorporated in the above paragraph. He is naturally not responsible for the form and ,details of presentation. In particular, he has expressed himself, Z.A.P. p. 930 (32), as dating the Carthage relief much later than the Augustan age. In that case, it may be a copy from a local monument of that period, or may come from a local post-Augustan monument in which the Roman Ara Pacis was followed.</page><page sequence="7">I40 THE ARA PACIS AUGUSTAE. secondary figure to the right, the male figure in agitated posture7 in the midst of troubled waves, is peculiarly appropriate if considered as the personification of the stormy Syrtes. And I am inclined to believe that some similar topographical signification was intended by the figure to the left, the draped womanly figure with veil, holding a torch in her left hand. It is with much diffidence that I suggest the identification of the figure as Luna, and its interpretation as a reference to the :eX vns 'Opos, 1 which the vulgar notions as to the geography of the interior of Africa may conceivably have made to extend much further to the west than one would infer from Ptolemy. But I offer this merely as a suggestion of the sort of geographical signification that may be latent in the figure in question. Professor Studniczka, to whom is due the identification of the figure to the right as the Syrtes, in a letter to me is inclined to see in the figure to the left the Dea caelestis of Carthage. This is quite possible, but I am not aware of conclusive instances of the Dea caelestis being represented in this manner. In any case, the relief from Carthage, with its variations from the Ara Pacis relief, seems to lend support rather than otherwise to the interpretation which I have suggested for the latter. So much for the indications afforded by the relief itself. Let us now consider the arrangement of the Ara Pacis as a whole, in the light of the interpretation of the matronly figure as Italia. If the result is the establishment of a logical and orderly arrangement of the various parts of the frieze, it will be reasonable to infer that the identification is justified. At the north side of the east door of the monument is seated Roma, accompanied by attendant figures; the throng on the north side, including apparently senators, priests and other dignitaries, as well as private citizens, with their families, represent the Roman people, and they lead us on to the group in the north part of the west end, where Mars, the divine founder of the city and the guardian of its destinies, is contemplating the wolf with the twins. In perfect symmetry, 2 at the south side of the east door is seated Italia, who only a short time before the inception of the Ara Pacis had been similarly associated with Roma, in Horace's lines o tutela praesens Italiae dominaeque Romae. 3 I Ptol. Geogr. iv, 8, 2, and the passages in other writers cited in Muller's ed. of Ptol. loc. cit. 2 Except that Roma seems to have occupied the left-hand part, not the centre, of the space to the north of the door. 3 Carm. iv, I4,43, f: on the other hand, the rellus and Roma on the Gemma Augustea (see above, p. 136) cannot be quoted as a parallel by those who interpret our central figure as " Tellus "; for on the gem Tellus does not serve to balance Roma, as the interest in the composition starts with the figure of Augustus and moves toward the left: Tellus and her companions are conceived. of, from the standpoint of the Augustus, as in the background.</page><page sequence="8">THE ARA PACIS AUGUSTAE. I4I The persons gathered on the south side, in particular the imperial 'family and the members of those priesthoods which were closely associated with it, are the representatives of the Italians, and their glances direct us to the south part of the west end, where is the figure of Aeneas, the founder of the Julian house, the hero who brought the penates to Italy. If the interpretation proposed in this article is correct, then -the relief in the Uffizi is not merely one of the noblest products .of Augustan art: it deserves to be. classed with Virgil's encomium *of Italy as an adequate expression of the feelings of grateful reverence, ,entertained toward their native land by the men who had witnessed the termination of one cycle of her history, and who themselves had been largely instrumental in preparing for a new era of peace, plenty and prosperity. And the monument of which it forms a part, far from showing lack of coherence in its composition, is one *of the most carefully and logically conceived structures of which we have knowledge, one in which architect and sculptor worked in perfect harmony to express the combination of lofty spiritual ideal and profound historical truth.</page><page sequence="9">J.R.S. vol. iii (1913).
