<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die Ara Nixon-Kissinger 1969-1974: konservative Reform der Weltpolitik. By Christian Hacke. Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta. 1983. 319pp. Index. THOUGH the publishers claim this as the first comprehensive German-language study of foreign relations in the Nixon-Kissinger era, the word they perhaps want is extended. After all, Latin America is barely mentioned (Chile being a glaring omission); while black Africa receives even less coverage. What we have instead is a partial description and interpretation of United States relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and Western Europe; American policy in the Middle East; the ending of the Vietnam war; and the impact of Watergate. The book's strongest and longest section is the discussion of the Nixon-Kissinger Europapolitik. Here Hacke builds on his previous work to trace the connections and differences between American-Soviet detente and the Ostpolitik of Brandt and Scheel. The much shorter chapter on the Middle East neatly depicts Kissinger as political broker- though the contemporary evidence for the fragility of his shuttle diplomacy is ignored. More mixed still is the chapter on Vietnam, which begins well but ultimately disappoints. Hacke wisely avoids a narrative but instead becomes entangled in a number of different conceptual analyses, the most important and damaging being that Nixon and Kissinger believed the 'fall' of South Vietnam to be inevitable but blamed it upon their domestic opponents and archaic constitutional restraints. In the chapters on Vietnam and Watergate Hacke is at his most ambivalent: here justifying Nixon and Kissinger, there censuring them for deceit, sometimes portraying them as tragic victims of their predecessors' mistakes. None of this is new, of course, except in combination. Only slightly more novel is Hacke's role as Kissinger's counsel against his further-right critics. It was (Hacke argues) Kissinger theoretically (and Nixon more practically) who set out to 'de-ideologize' superpower relations in order to restore the classic nineteenth-century balance of power. The terminology, no less than the interpretation of history, is highly problematical; but Hacke characteristically takes Kissinger at his own evaluation and credits him (and Nixon) with aligning American commitments and goals closer to American capabilities. This analysis may be accepted (thanks, not least, to the recent study by John Lewis Gaddis, Strategies of containment: a critical appraisal of postwar American national security policy, New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983, reviewed in International Affairs, Summer 1984) but hardly in conjunction with the other explanatory categories adopted by Hacke-a repertoire which includes tragedy, the continuity and the circularity of American foreign relations, and the origins of fascism. If Hacke had followed the clues he himself uncovered (with Nixon and Kissinger as white revolutionaries) he might have fashioned his work around the theme of the domestic goals 183</page><page sequence="2">184 BOOK REVIEWS of these two self-styled conservatives. In this way the awkward anthropomorphism, apocalypticism (Spengler appears often in these pages) and ambivalence might have been replaced by a more convincing portrait of two disingenuous cynics, who twisted words and abused their power to achieve goals shared by many of their compatriots and numerous allies abroad. (Hacke avoids any sociological analysis-even of the domestic scene.) From this perspective Kissinger's frequent invocation of Metternich and Bismarck would be correctly interpreted, not as the historical wisdom of a philosopher-king, but as the pretentious nostalgia of a reactionary lost for words to justify anti-democratic goals and methods.
