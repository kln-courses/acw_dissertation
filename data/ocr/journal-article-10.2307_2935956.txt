Nearly every one enjoys the Helen; but scholars, perhaps wondering, more Aristotelico, whether the pleasure it offers is of sort "appropriate" to tragedy, have been much disturbed by its comic or apparently comic elements. Gottfried Hermann granted the play a few moving scenes, but found it lacking the excitement of the Iphi- geneia in Tauris and wanting in the high passions which make a trag- edy.3 Paley, though he admired the Helen's liveliness and variety, adjudged it "a goodplay, not perhapsgreatasatragedy."4 Decharme, after a brief analysis of the recognition scene, asked, "But where is the tragedy?"5 Hugo Steiger regarded the whole work as a comic parody of the Odyssey, an escapist flight into fairyland amid the bleak years following the Sicilian expedition.6 Verrall found its " spirit and tone" so " unique" in Attic drama that he developed what has become his most famous eccentricity to account for its singularity.7 Norwood, writing in 1920, was nonplussed: the play was "in no possible sense a the Second International Congress of Classical Studies i (Copenhagen I958) I55-62 (re- printed in Schwinge, but here cited from the original publication and henceforth referred to as Zuntz, "Politics "); idem, " On Euripides' Helena: Theology and Irony," in Euripide, Entretiens sur l'antiquite classique 6 (Vandoevres-Geneva I960) 20I-41 (cited henceforth simply as Zuntz).

I3 Faced with such a diverse array of opinions, one will readily agree with the author of the newest, and biggest, commentary on the play: ". . . Scarcely any Euripidean drama is so difficult to grasp and therefore so controversial as the Helen."I4 The last decade has seen a significant shift in approach and evalua- tion. The studies of the form and technique of Euripidean drama by a number of German scholars have led to a greater appreciation of the intricacy and intellectual virtuosity of the later plays. Works like the Ion, the Taurian Iphigeneia, even the much maligned Orestes are now vouchsafed more than mere theatricality purchased at the expense of logic, psychology, or verisimilitude. They reveal a mind involved in continual experimentation and in the ingenious elaboration of new forms as the vessels of new ideas, a restless spirit playing incessantly with new combinations of convention and innovation to bring the problems of his time-often, mutatis mutandis, those of ours-into sharper focus and starker outline.I5 The essays of Professors Burnett and Zuntz have been especially 8 Norwood 260. 9 Ibid. 262.

Drawing upon the brief but valuable remarks of Solmsen in I934, they have given the themes of illusion and deception their rightful place in the seriousness of Euripides' dramatic conception and have brought to deserved promi- nence the role of Theonoe and the theological and philosophical issues of the play.I6 This approach also informs the recent discussions of the play by Conacher and Kannicht. Indeed, the latter, with his citations of early Stoic epistemology, takes this approach to its logical conclu- sion.'7 There is, as Matthiessen has recently warned, some danger in going too far and forgetting that the Helen (pace Verrall) is also a play for the stage. Yet the case for the more serious and philosophical view of the play has been successfully argued from a number of points of view. It is the aim of the present study to explore further and to expand this line of approach. II The philosophical side of the Helen as a "comedy of ideas" is only half the story. The Helen is also a romance. In addition to its setting in 16 On the importance of Theonoe and the themes connected with her see also E. Schlesinger, Gnomon 37 (I965) 34I-2. Matthiessen accepts the essential seriousness of the play, but wisely warns against going too far in extracting a systematic philosophical or "higher" religious conception for all of Euripides' thought (see 703-4). Still, his attempt to limit Theonoe's role to that of a " Nebenfigur" (697) is not fully successful. Her limited appearance on stage is counterbalanced by the fact that she is spoken of from the beginning to the very end of the play, and it does not answer the interpretations of Zuntz and Burnett merely to concede that she is "eine eindrucksvolle Gestalt" (697). Dale seems to waver between both views: " One thing seems clear: it mattered to Euripi- des that this play should be seen to be more than a melodramatic piece of intrigue, rich in paradox and excitement but somewhat blunt morally" (xiv); "There is much play with such antitheses as soma/onomla, and flashes of irony from this source point the dia- logue; but there is no metaphysical or psychological depth here, nor would anything of the kind be either conceivable or appropriate" (xvi). Lattimore strikes a balance in the introduction to his translation, The Complete Greek Tragedies, 3, Euripides (Chicago I959) 486: "Better to take this play neither too seriously nor too lightly. It is romance, but not without recognition of realities, even realities new to tragedy." Anne P. Burnett, Catastrophe Survived: Euripides' Plays of Mixed Reversal (Oxford I97I) 76-IOO, appeared too late to enter into my interpretation of the play. She now takes the play as essen- tially a parody of tragedy which is, however, saved from utter frivolity by the tragic, Antigone-like figure of Theonoe (pp. 95-96, 99-IOO). From the comic side of the play see also the recent essay of Bernard Knox, "Euripidean Comedy," in The Rarer Action: Essays in Honor of Francis Fergusson (New Brunswick, N.J. I97I) 75-77. 17 See Kannicht I.64-65.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 557 the Egyptian never-never land, the play also includes the reunion of long-separated lovers, the loss and recovery of identity, the super- natural knowledge of a magician-like princess, and (like Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing or Cymbeline) a calumniated heroine whose virtue will carry her and her beloved through the perils of delusion and restore them to their own kingdom to live happily every after.'8 Euripides has intertwined these hoary and popular themes of the romantic plot with the sophistic intellectualism of his own day. The combination is extraordinary. The closest parallels are perhaps Sophocles' Philoctetes and Aristophanes' Frogs. But Euripides has pushed the two sides, romance and intellectualism, to their furthest extremes. He has thus created a Chimaera-like tour de force in which amusement and puzzlement follow close upon one another. The analogies with A Midsummer Night's Dream or The Temipest cited by Schiegel, Verrall, and others were largely pejorative, supportive of their dismissal of the Helen because it is not "tragic " and therefore not " serious." I9 The idols of high seriousness and dramatic realism have tended, until recently, to usurp the whole of the domain of criticism, banishing the more conventional and unrealistic forms, like romance, to the remote corners.20 Northrop Frye's distinction between "Iliadic" and "Odyssean" critics is helpful here. Classicists, like Aristotle and "Longinus," tend to be "Iliadic."21 Romance, on the other hand, requires a suspension of criticaljudgment and an acceptance of non-common-sense situations and conventions. Thus an approach to the Helen based on psychological realism, like that of Professor Karin Alt recently, while it can elucidate individual scenes, misses the heart of the play because psychological realism, however helpful for the parts, is not an appropriate response to the whole. The play has suffered from a peculiar kind of reductio ad absurduin from which it is only slowly beginning to recovcr. What has long been observed of Shakespeare is equally true here: "It is easy to make a Shakespearean play look ridiculous by refusing to accept its convention." 22 i8 On this female figure in romance see Northrop Frye, A Natural Perspective: The Development of Shakespearean Comedy and Romance (New York I965) 63-65. 19 See, for example, Verrall 46; Schlegel (above, note 2) lOc. cit. 20 See Frye (above, note i8) 9; also his Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton I957) 5I-52. 21 Frye, A Natural Perspective (above, note i8) I2. 22 Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="6">558 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I One of the recurrent devices of romance is the division between two worlds, a "real" world of pain and trouble and an "ideal" world of peace, serenity, simplicity, rustic ease.23 The plot often centers on the passage between these two worlds and especially on the hero's return from the " ideal" to the " real " world. By the very fact of envisaging a second world superior to the humdrum everyday world in which most of us live, romance operates within a framework of antitheses. Not every romance need develop this potential of an antithetical structure, but the possibility is inherent in the convention, and the Helen exploits it very fully. With this contrast between real and ideal worlds the Helen combines the theme of recognition. The romance and the recognition play are distinct forms, but they have affinities which allow happy marriages to occur.24 Recognition easily fits into the movement in romance be- tween different worlds or different levels of truth. Since the passage between worlds and the recovery of a lost loved one and/or a lost truth also correspond to the awakening from a deluded state and to the re- acquisition of a lost vitality, romance makes frequent use of the arche- types of death and rebirth. The pattern is already established in the Odyssey and ingeniously varied in the late Shakespearean romances.25 But the Helen provides the first extant example in Western literature of the full-blown fusion of romance and recognition themes. The passage between real and ideal worlds, when compounded with the mistaken identities and delusions of the recognition play, invites paradox and irony to a high degree. In the Helen the irony and para- dox have a bitter tone,26 especially, as we shall argue, toward the end of 23 See the discussion of the three realms of late Shakespearean romance in Frye, A Natural Perspective (above, note i8) chap. 4, especially I36-59. 24 See Lattimore (above, note i) 53: " The theme of the Helen, beyond all other extant Greek plays, is illusion. All dramas which are truth-plays: the foundling stories; the stories of lost persons recovered, of mistaken identity; the stories of character defamed and vindicated; all have this in common. A lie has been perpetrated on the dramatic world. However lively the activity, it is all shaped toward the revelation of the truth: which comes, indeed, after the darkest moment." 25 See Northrop Frye's remarks on the different groups of characters in The Tempest: "Each goes through a pursuit of illusions, an ordeal, and a symbolic vision": N. Frye, ed., William Shakespeare, The Tempest (Baltimore 1959) Introduction, I5. 26 For a good appreciation of the bitterness of the Helen's irony see Paul Friedlinder, "Die griechische Tragodie und das Tragische," Die Antike 2 (I926) Io5: ". . . So bitter, dass von dorther das Komische iiberall einen b6sen und schneidenden Ton empfangt."</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 102] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 559 the play. Like comedy, the Helen plays upon a contrast between normality and abnormality, the expected and the fantastic. Yet the "normal" world in the background (especially in the lyrics) is not the every-day life of a Dicaeopolis or a Peithetaerus, but the hellish world of Troy, with the grim associations carried by Troy from the Iliad and Agamemnon to the Ajax and Troades. The central irony of the Helen lies in its antithesis of appearance and reality.27 What is the " real " nature of the world? What is " word" (onoma) and what "fact" or "deed" (pragma)? Helen is herself the symbol of this mysteriousness of reality, a quality which she retains from the Odyssey to the adaptation of the Euripidean drama in Hof- mannsthal's Agyptische Helena 28 and Seferis' 'EAEvrj. Helen has a double existence: she lives in the world of both appear- atice and reality. Men have treated an empty cloud-image as the "real" Helen and have fought a long and bloody war to possess it-a "real" war in the "real" world, with the ultimate reality as the price, death. The "real," or at least the corporeal, Helen, however, dwells in remote Egypt which, despite its geographical factuality, is closer to the island of an Alcinous or a Prospero than to an actual place. Even this Egyptian fairyland has its divided aspect. It has its "fairy prin- cess," but also its ogre-like, dangerous ruler. Together this royal pair present opposed images of virginal purity and lustful (if vulnerable) desire. The ultimate irony in Euripides' treatment of these basic antitheses lies in the fact that the play never completely resolves the question of which aspect of reality is the "true" one. We cannot be certain that the potential order and purity conveyed by the figure of Theonoe may 27 See Burnett, IS52: "The language, the plot, and the very form of the Helen all have been made to express this tension between what is and what only seems to be."

Is there a stable reality? If there is, can we know it? If so, can we communicate it: is its nature reducible to language? These are the questions that Gorgias and his contempora- ries were raising (FVS6 82B3). They are also, at least in part, the questions which the Helen raises, for this play, with its recurrent anti- theses between appearance and reality, onoma and pragma, is simul- taneously about the nature of reality and the nature of language and art.30 Behind these issues lies a deeply felt rift in the late fifth century between man and his world, between the constructs (broadly speaking, nomnos) with which man orders and organizes the phenomena around him and the alien substance of that realm (physis) which he seeks thus to order.31 One result of this familiar cleavage between nomos and physis is a loss of confidence in the belief that the traditional forms of thought and action are adequate to grasp and to deal with what is now felt to be the "truth" or the "reality." For men like Protagoras, Gorgias, Antiphon the Sophist, successors to the still (relatively) inno- cent logic of the Eleatics, " truth" and "reality" (aleMtheia, ta onta, einai) are now problematical terms. In the Hippolytus and the Medea Euripides had explored this rift in its psychological dimensions: the split between inner and outer worlds.32 In the Bacchae he was to explore radically its social as well as its psycho- logical implications: the division between the order of society and the potential disorder within man, within the very man who, as king, embodies that order. 29 For further discussion see below, section IX. 30 See Solmsen, "Onoma," passim; Griffith 36-37. 31 See Arrowsmith 38: " What Euripides reported, with great clarity and honesty, was the widening gulf between reality and tradition; between the operative and the pro- fessed values of his culture; between fact and myth; between nomos and physis; between life and art." For these matters with other reference to fifth-century literature and thought see Kannicht I.57-60; Felix Heinimann, Nomos und Physis = SchweizBeitrAlt i (Basel I945) 46-58; W. K. G. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy, 3, The Fifth Century Enlightenment (Cambridge I969) 55-134. 32 For the correlations between inner and outer worlds and appearance and reality see my essay, " Shame and Purity in Euripides' Hlippolytus," Hermes 98 (1970) 278-99.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 56i In the Helen the psychological and social implications of these con- flicts are marginal. Yet its antitheses between appearance and reality, onomna and pragma, are deeply akin to these critical rifts between nomos and physis. If works like the Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae ask whether the ultimate reality is reconcilable with human order and human society, the Helen asks the anterior question: Is reality perhaps so problematical, so divided against itself, that we cannot even say what " reality " is at all, or cannot even be sure that anything is " real" ?33 The Helen thus has a more epistemological and ontological focus than the above-mentioned plays, with their extreme crises in the realms of action and society. This fact accounts in part for the playfulness and questionable "seriousness " of the drama. The theory of relativity can be taken more lightly than immediate issues of good and evil. But the Helen's antitheses between truth and appearance embrace the ethical side of the questions about the nature of reality as well as the epistemo- logical questions about the role of language, myth, and art in com- municating that reality. One cannot fully separate the meaning of the play as a criticism of life from its meaning as a criticism of art. III The recently discovered Oxyrrhynchus fragment relating to Stesi- chorus' Palinode makes it certain that Euripides has taken the essential outlines of the eidolon motif from Stesichorus.34 Already in Stesichorus Helen remained with Proteus in Egypt while the eidolon went to Troy. But, whereas Stesichorus' eidolon seems to have served primarily to exonerate Helen, Euripides' has the philosophical function of asking what reality is. This shift of emphasis may well be Euripides' innova- tion in the myth. To secure this new emphasis he has combined the eidolon with the theme of recognition (anagndrisis). 33Compare also the way in which the divided nature of the gods (who embody, in part, the nature of our reality) is related to divisions within the psychological and moral realms in plays like the Electra, H.F., and Ion. See also Arrowsmith 47 ff. 34 P.Oxy. 2506, frag. 26, col. I, 2-I6 (available also in PMG frag. 193, Page). For discussion see Kannicht 1.30-33 and 26-48 on the mythical traditions generally; Dale xvii-xxiv. Previous discussions of the myth, however, are still useful, especially Hermann's collection of passages in his Praefatio, viii-xi; see also Pohlenz 1.382-83 and 2.I 59; Schmid 502-4 with the literature there cited; Conacher 286-89.</page><page sequence="10">562 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I Symptomatic of this same shift of emphasis is the deliberate gemina- tion of elements in the plot, beginning with the two Helens. There are also two scenes of a Greek warrior landing in Egypt (68 ff. and 3 86 ff.), two confused meetings with Helen (72 ff., 546 ff.), two barbarian rulers, two scenes of deceiving Theocylmenus (i i65 ff., I390 ff.), two promises of complicity in silence (IOI7-23, I387-89), and so on. This doubling of motifs reflects the mirror-like confusion with which "reality" in this play confronts the human participants.35 There are also doublings of a different nature in the metaphors and the rhetoric. These are less important as far as the actual movement of the plot is concerned, but in fact they are even more significant for the play's major antitheses. There is a "living" and "dead" Menelaus, an apparent and actual "justice," and two tales about the Dioscuri (I 3 8-42): TE. TEOV(LOt KaL0 ov C &amp;Evaot vo o' EorToYv Aoy.

Everything that touches Helen most intimately-as her brothers here -has this divided quality. Helen's interlocutor in lines I38-4I, the rough and practical-minded warrior Teucer, breaks off abruptly, "Enough of tales" (a'Ats- be i0ov, I43). But in fact other mythoi central to Helen's identity recur with the same puzzling doubleness. In her opening lines she raises doubts about the tale of her own birth (EL oraks oVT-os AO'yos, 2I). Twice again in the early part of the play she returns to the dubieties surrounding her and her brothers' origins (see 256-59, 284-85, where note qaortuv in 259 and AEyo1uEvw in 284.).36 In order to emphasize these themes of reality and illusion, Euripides begins the action not immediately with Menelaus, which would be the 35On these double elements in the plot and their significance see Strohm 85-86; Zuntz 223; Pohlenz 1.386.

Since at least Gottfried Hermann, commentators have objected to Teucer. He is, they allege, a neces- sary, but clumsy dramatic expedient who serves only to inform Helen of events at Troy and especially of Menelaus' supposed death.37 Some scholars have found Teucer so disturbing that they have suspected an elaborate political allegory in his presence on the stage.38 It is true, as Alt and Kannicht have pointed out, that the Teucer scene also serves to reveal the hatred felt toward Helen among the Greeks and thus to deepen her sense of shame and guilt, hence adding new force to the theme of the horror of war.39 Yet the main purpose of the scene, as Steiger saw in I908, is to continue and dramatize the dichotomies of appearance and reality broached in the prologue.40 The stichomythia between Helen and Teucer, especially in II 7-22, provides the first full development of the antitheses between appear- ance and reality. It also presents those antitheses in a vocabulary which refers unmistakably to current epistemological discussions, as is clear from lines II9 and I22 and the unusual abstraction, dokesis here.4I The very arbitrariness and superfluity of the exchange between Helen and Teucer and the very looseness of its connection with the action reveal, in fact, how much this play moves on the level of pure intellect as well as that of fictive action, "ideas" as well as plot. Euripides' bold creation spans both philosophic logos and dramatic mythos. At the end of the scene with Teucer the antitheses take on a new coloring. "Although you have a body like Helen's," Teucer con- cludes, "you haven't a mind like hers, but one very different ('EAEV, 37 See Hermann, Praefatio, xi-xii: ". . . Persona non necessaria ac propemodum inutilis, nisi ut ex eo captam esse Troiam, Menelaumque non esse Argis nec Spartae Helena cognoscat." See also Schmid 507, who regards Teucer as ajob's messenger who, however, serves to create dramatic tension by raising the hope of a happy ending. 38 See Henri Gregoire's introduction to the Bude edition, Euripide 5 (Paris I950) I7f.; also D. L. Drew, "The Political Purpose in Euripides' Helena," CP 25 (I930) I87-89.

He then departs with a curse for the other "Helen" and a blessing for the woman before him (I62-63). Here the epistemological antithesis ramifies into another antithesis between outward reality and inward, "body" (sdma) and " mind" (phrenes). The epistemological and onto- logical question begins to extend into psychological and ethical dimensions as well. To achieve this fusion, Euripides interweaves the basic antithesis of appearance and reality with a parallel antithesis of death and life. That combination is already implicit in the scene with Teucer, for the dialogue moves quickly from the questions of "appearance" and the trustworthiness of vision (II 7-22) to the question of whether Menelaus is alive or dead (I23-33). It is a touch of fine pathos on the part of Euripides, always the dramatic poet, that the dialectical caution and subtlety which Helen exhibits in the former passage completely desert her in the latter. Wholly a woman where her emotions are concerned, she accepts Teucer's report of Menelaus at face value and responds not with the sophistic distinctions of II7-22, but with the emotional language of heart-felt despair: aiiTcoA0'4EaTa (I33). This interweaving of the two sets of antitheses becomes especially important in the second half of the play. Menelaus will "appear" to be dead, but his fictitious death (Aoy) is the means to real (e'pyco) life (cf. I050-52). It is, however, the eidolon which first brings the two antitheses to- gether in the prologue (30-4I). Hera, angry because she lostt he competition with the other two goddesses, "turned to empty air" (eqV4WUSE, 3 2)42 Helen's union with Paris and gave him " an image with the breath of life in it" (dwcoAov E'q7Tvovv ovpavoi3 (VVOEct cL7TO, 34) which she had fashioned from sky. Thus Paris, though "seeming" to have her, had only " empty appearance " (Kat 'OKEt 2' E'XEtV- / KEVT/IV OKTUtV, OVK xwV, 3 5-36). " But the plans of Zeus fall in with these sufferings" (36-37) and bring war upon "the wretched Trojans" (37- 4I). The important word doke64sis, here given the revealing epithet KEIr (36), contains the antithesis between appearance and reality.

The eidolon, however, has a moral dimension too. It introduces the theme of war, the pettiness of its causes (Pi), the emptiness of its goals and victories, the suffering of its victims (39).43 This moral prob- lem has an extension in the divine realm in the relation of Hera and Zeus to the eidolon. The goddess, spiteful, jealous, savage-still bearing traces of the fearful deity of the Heracles Mad, the embodiment of the most primitive anthropomorphism-uses the eidolon only for her personal revenge. Zeus, however, has "counsels" (bouleumata) of larger scope. These, though harsh in the present, work toward an ultimate and necessary good (36-4i) and mean well for Helen herself (44-45). The eidolon, therefore, holds the balance, as throughout the play, not only between appearance and reality, but also between images of cosmic chaos (Hera) and cosmic order (Zeus).44 Yet even here the nature of the reality of the universe is not entirely clear or unitary, for Zeus' "counsels" are twofold. On the one hand stands the large, impersonal purpose of lightening earth's burden (40), but on the other hand stands the honoring of Achilles, with the anthropomorphic echoes of the first book of the Iliad. Zeus is the lofty Olympian who protects Mother Earth, but he is also the seductive white-skinned swan who flashes through the air to lie with Leda (2i5-i6). Euripides is aware of both the beauty and bestiality of the gods. Teucer, an actual participant in the horrors of the war from which Helen, for all her sympathy (39), has been so far removed, raises the moral side of the eidolon motif to a high pitch of emotional intensity (72-75): t , , , , , ,, , of f ' GEot', Tv ELov obtv; EXGur-'qv OpJi , I , , , , / yVVatKOSr EKWC (OVtOV, 1 1L aITCOAEUrEV aTcvTas ' 'AxatovsE.

Though Teucer does not yet know anything about the eidolon, his language (b0tv, Jp65, EtKW 0'OVw, lna) takes up the eidolon theme from 3I-4I and binds it tightly into the talk of vision, appearance, reality in the ensuing stichomythia (especially, as noted above, II7-22). The passage begins on an emotive-ethical note and comes only gradu- ally to the cooler, intellectualist and epistemological concerns of dokesis. As it does so, however, it weaves together these two aspects of the appearance-reality dichotomy, the speculative and the ethical. The fusion becomes stronger as the play proceeds. In the sticho- mythia between Helen and Menelaus which just precedes their recog- nition the epistemological themes are again a major concern (575-83). Gradually, however, Helen's account of the eidolon expands into the questions of the futility of the war (acdGqp, OOEv cv 0GEo?7roV-z- ExEts AfX 584) and the nature of the divine order (Hera in 586). The messenger, who enters to confirm Helen's story, brings the two aspects of the antitheses together even more pointedly. His statement of the pragma-onoma dichotomy (60I) leads at once to a concise recognition of the futility of the war: AE'yw 7T0o'vov CE as vpovs' -z-AXvat p.acrqv (603). The whole speech of 605-2i repeats the moral questions of the divine order raised in the prologue (3I-46).45 In fact, the words of the departing eidolon which the messenger quotes in 6o8, Cd) TaAacdrrwpot lIpvyEs, echo the " real " Helen's sympathy for the " wretched Trojans" in 39-echo, that is, the moral theme of the suffering inflicted by war. A few lines later, however, we return to the intellectualist atmosphere of the dokesis theme: 8OKOVVTES 'EAE'v'qv OVK 6'XoV' VEXEEtV HlapV (6I I). The emotional life of the characters receives its due in the lyric kommos in which Menelaus and Helen can express their joy in redis- covering one another (625-97), a passage which also provides some necessary relief from the confusion of identities and antitheses. But the moral themes of the war and the divine order return, interwoven with the questions about reality and illusion and extended to Menelaus. The gods deceive us, he says, (rrpoS 06Ecv 8' '14 LEV 7Ta/-'q/LLEvot, 704), and 45 Note the verbal echoes between lines 44 and 6o5 and lines 45 and 606.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 102] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 567 then he echoes the messenger's words about the emptiness of the cloud- image over which they have toiled so long (705-6; cf. 603). The divine realm itself is full of strife (0ECJv rptuu3Cov 'pts, 708). God is a baffling and many-faceted thing, the messenger replies (o 0,Ed cosE J Ov It TOtKtAOV / KIL 3VcpKaproV, 7II-I2). At this point in the play, when the two main protagonists are brought together on the stage, the fusion between the epistemological and moral-theological sides of the antitheses is complete. The vanity of dying for a cloud-image recurs in the messenger's denunciation of prophets. Calchas failed to tell the army the truth though " he saw his friends dying over a cloud" (749-50). This speech has bothered critics,46 but the theme of prophecy is relevant to the play's close interweaving of the intellectualist and ethical strands of appearance and reality. Prophecy, like the sense of sight in the scenes with Teucer and Menelaus earlier, is both a way of ascertaining the nature of reality and (for the Greeks) a practical means toward decision and action. The inward and forward-looking vision of the warriors at Troy (prophecy in Egypt is a different matter)47 proves as faulty as the simpler vision of the organs of sight and as fraught with moral consequences of disastrous scope. The important word Ha'-rr-v, "in vain," recurs here in 75I to mark the affinity with the ethical and emo- tional coloring of war's vanity in 603 and 705_7.48 The eidolon thus brings together a cluster of closely related themes: man's illusions about reality, the emptiness of war, the problem of the nature of the gods and of a simple anthropomorphic conception of the gods. All of these themes come together once more in the first stasimon (II07-64). It proceeds from the "sacred eidolon of Hera" (EwcoAov Epy "Hpas, I I 3 6) to the question of the nature of God (I I 3 7 if.). The latter meditation brings in its train the intellectualist vocabulary of vision (I I40) and " clarity " (to saphes, I I49; note also antilogois, I I42). 46 For example Gregoire (above, note 38) I2. 47 For the contrast between the prophets of 744-57 and the true "vision" of Theonoe see Bumett i58 and Matthiessen 696. 48 Note too Theoclymenus' failure to grasp the veracity of his sister's prophecy in his threat at I626: rotyap ovilror' a"AAov dLv8pa yEvJaeTra /iavrev/J4amv.

There, however, it shifts to the figure of Theoclymenus. Unphilosophical and unreflective though he is, he exclaims on the emptiness of war when Helen tells how the cloud- image vanished into the aether (I2I9-20): EA. vE0EArjs AE'yEs gayaApa; es aWOEp' o Xerat. eE. w Hpta,LE Kat yfi TpcOs, &lt;(c&gt; Eppeg /aUT?v. Theoclymenus' echo in I220 of the messenger in 603 and Menelaus in 706-7 is an intentional and subtle piece of irony. The delusiveness and futility of war expressed through the eidolon cling to Theoclymenus even after every one else has been enlightened. Near the end of the play, when the flesh-and-blood Helen has departed on an all too solid ship cajoled from Theoclymenus' own navy, the king speaks of her as if she were the cloud-image which flew off into the empty aether (I5I5-I6): Ay. 'EAE'vrq yap flE3K' ( XOOVO'g. @E. lrTEpOtctV apOEtcT -) 7XrESOcTLPfEt 7O8l; Theoclymenus' "lifted on wings" in i I6 is "an ironical adynaton," as Kannicht points out;50 but it also echoes the messenger's words of nascent illumination in 605-6: /3E/3?7KEV cIAoXos0 o?) 7Tpos alW'pos 7TTvxas apE-ca l(1avros... Thus it contrasts the recognition of Helen and Menelaus in that earlier scene (605-7I0) with the frustration and delusion of the empty-handed 49 See Grube 347: ". . .

Simultaneously it brings up again the whole atmosphere of confusion and the uncertainty of human knowledge developed in the first half of the play. Up to the intervention of the deus ex machina Theoclymenus reenacts the delusions of Menelaus. In so doing, he keeps alive to the end the questions of reality and illusion focused by the eidolon theme. IV Helen's beauty too mediates between the epistemological and the ethical themes, illusion and war. It signifies, as it did for Goethe and Hofmannsthal, a promise of happiness in a strange and violent world. Yet this beauty is also an object to be coveted and possessed. Hence, as Helen says again and again, it is also a curse (see 27, 235-36, 26i-63, 304-5, 383-84). It carries with it the hint of the eidolon's vacuity (see 262)5' and memories of irremediable loss and fearful suffering. This ambiguous status of Helen's beauty-and of beauty, kallos, generally in the play-is another aspect of the question of the nature of reality. Is even the supreme beauty of a Helen, object of long and hard wars, not only illusory, but even destructive? It is natural that the "real" Helen, whose "imagee" has destroyed Troy, should feel more keenly than any other character the horror of its fall and pity for its victims (see 39, I09, i96-202, 229-40, etc.). Yet as the embodiment of a purer kind of "beauty" Helen also appears against the background of a quasi-pastoral "green world" of Pans, echoing flutes, Nymphs and Naiads (I79-90, 349-50). Even here, however, the peacefulness of these settings is tinged by suggestions of violence and specifically the violence of the rape of Persephone to which Helen's rape is closely parallel. When Hermes carried Helen away (dvaparrcaas St' a&amp;0E'poS0, 246), she was plucking flowers by the Eurotas, as Persephone, in the Homeric Hymn, was plucking flowers in "that fair field of Enna."52 In a later lyrical passage, shortly after another reference to her homeland (349-50), Helen again speaks of a 5' The wish in 262 that she could wash her beauty away like a painting (or like a painted statue) uses the same word (agalma) as that used for the empty phantom in 705 and I2I9 (VE0E'ATjSa`yaA4ia). 52 See h.

Hermes, says Helen, carried her off "through the aether" (t' atOE'pos, 246), and we recall the aether- theme of the prologue (cf. 36 and 44-45). Immediately after these words Helen explains that her "name" (onoma) was a subject of " empty talk" at Troy (La#t'tov 'XEt bac-rtv, 25I).55 The "rape" theme also raises the related questions of the nature of the gods and their connection with human morality. Hermes' "snatching up" (avap7nauas', 246) replaces the actual "rape" of Helen by Paris (cf. avapvracyas, 50).56 In the prologue Helen described her removal to Egypt as part of the plans of Zeus (46-S50). There it re- flected the larger order of a directing divine power. In the parode, however, the chief agent is Hera, representative of the chaos of anthro- pomorphic gods. It is she, says Helen in 241-43, who has sent Hermes. Thus the removal of Helen to Egypt appears under two different aspects. In the prologue it appears as a benign protection; in the parode it appears as the disruptive act of ajealous goddess with accom- panying images of rape in the background. One recalls also Apollo's seduction of Creusa-also as she was plucking flowers (Ion 888-96)- an act equally ambiguous in its implications about the gods' relation to morality. The two aspects under which Hermes' "snatching up" of Helen appears restate the prologue's antithesis between Zeus and Hera in a new form and carries to another level the divisions within the fabric of reality. This division corresponds also to the two sides of the Perse- phone myth which lies in the background: death versus rebirth, joy 53 Verrall I22 strongly objected to this passage as "Alexandrian poetry, not Attic, learned, frigid, and hollow at the heart"-a judgment which the interpretation here offered should mitigate. 54 For the myth of Kos see Dale and Kannicht ad loc. 55 For the problem of the interpretation of this passage see Kannicht ad loc. (2.85). 56 The noun is a hapax legornenon, as Dale ad loc. observes.</page><page sequence="19">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 57I versus sorrow, the beauty of Helen's song (I83-9I) or the flowers she plucks (243-45) versus the horror of Troy. Yet in raising the question of these divisions within the divine order, the parode also places the sufferings of Helen against the background of a universal archetype of rape and restoration, loss and recovery, and hints at a large rhythmic pattern to be reenacted in her sufferings. At the same time the violence of Paris' act (see 50) looms even larger against the mythical background of the rape of Persephone. The two sides of Helen's beauty appear especially strongly in this section of the parode. Her compassion and the grace of her lyrics present its positive value. Yet, as she says, her beauty excites violence and strife among the men who would possess her: Paris sailed Ert rO &amp;)UTVXE'cfl-aTov / KaAAos0, us 'Aot, yc4Lwv / a4Wv (236-38).57 This disastrous possessiveness toward beauty has its analogue in the divine world too. The origins of the catastrophe lie in the three goddesses' contest " about beauty " (KaAAOVS 7TrEpt, 23). The repetition of kallos a few lines later, but now referring to Helen's beauty (-rov3jtuv be KaAAos, 27), makes the parallel unmistakable. Later, Theonoe traces Aphrodite's enmity to a desire to avoid the appearance of" having bought (the prize of) beauty" (IL-qU 7Tpta1vEj Aavj / -ro KaAAos, 885- 86). The goddesses are as covetous of "beauty" as the human characters, and the two levels are complementary manifestations of the same disruptive forces working both within the human soul and within the world-order. The antithesis between the two aspects of beauty involves that same rift in the nature of reality which we have already discussed: Zeus on the one side, the petty goddesses on the other. That antithesis is ex- pressed on another level in a contrast between Egypt and Troy. "Beauty" appears in the very first line of the play, with Egypt's KaA- AtrvapOEvoL pAoaL. Helen's beauty, felt as a positive quality, can rest innocently in Egypt, while its destructive force operates through the eidolon at Troy. The play's very first word, NEtAov, creates, as Zuntz remarked, the setting of "a far away, fabulous land."5 The paradox 57 The text is uncertain here, though gAot, important for the present intepretation, seems sound: see Dale and Kannicht, ad loc. Kannicht reads Wilamowitz' emendation ya/4L, which does not substantially alter the sense. 58 Zuntz 202: "That first verse, nay, the very first word-NEAov-has pleasantly transferred him into a far-away, fabulous land."</page><page sequence="20">572 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I of the "white melting snows " which feed the " maiden-lovely streams of Egypt's warm fertile fields" in the third line evokes the atmosphere of wonder and fascination with which the Greeks were wont to regard the sources of the Nile.59 The marine setting of lines 5-I5, the suggestive names of Psamathe and Nereus, the mysterious power of Theonoe with her double name (reminiscent perhaps of the double names of Homeric epic) all conduce to the same effect. Verrall, giving, as often, the wrong answers to the right questions, asks why Proteus should be the king of Egypt.60 The answer may be simply Euripides' desire to recreate something of the fairy-tale mood of Odyssey 4 and of the Odyssey generally. Like the Odyssean Phaea- cia, Egypt is a mysterious point of transition between worlds, a point where the past can be relived and in some sense transformed. Helen and Theonoe, like the mysterious and helpful goddesses and knowing women of the Odyssey-Leucothea, Circe, Calypso, Nausicaa, Arete, even the Helen of Odyssey 4.2I9-64 and I5.I25-30-hold the keys to life and death, loss or recovery of the past from which the hero is separated. The removed beauty of Egypt where Helen laments like a Nymph or Naiad among echoing mountains (i84-90) bears a strong similarity to the gentle, serene setting of Helen's Sparta in 243-45 and 349-50. There are other verbal associations between Egypt and Sparta. The "streams of the Eurotas" (E3pc6-ra poas) in I24 and I62 recall the " streams of Nile " in line i. The echo of that first line is even stronger in the expression poat / rovi KaAALovaKOs. . .. E3pdrra in 492-93, es- pecially as NEdAov rrap' o'XOaS immediately precedes (49I). Egypt's tranquillity, like the Spartan home of Helen before Paris' intrusion, has associations of a happiness and an innocence either outside of or an- terior to the complexities of passion and war. Both places have traits of an Eden-like world of youth and sheltered maidenhood. They exemplify a locus amoenus, like Ibycus' "grove of the Maidens" or Hippolytus' meadow, where a fragile and virginal beauty takes refuge 59Cf. Hdt. 2.20-28; Eurip. Archelaus, frag. 228. See also Bacon i5q; Dale ad vs. 3. 60 Verrall 73. Steiger 202-8 has fully demonstrated and illustrated Euripides' in- debtedness to the Odyssey, but his interpretation of the data (Euripides' parody of the epic) is not necessarily to be accepted.</page><page sequence="21">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 573 from a harsher world.61 Here too the associations of the Persephone myth behind 243-45 are again relevant. That aspect of the figure of Helen which is innocent and faithful has a natural kinship with the serenity of this Egyptian-Spartan setting. Egypt's recent king was "the most chaste of mortals" (7ravrov .-.. JucopOVE%r-arOV flpOTrJV, 47). His s'phrosyne' stands at the opposite pole from the evil reputation of the Trojan "Helen" which torments the "real" Helen. Here, in his kingdom, she can "preserve her bed pure (aKEpatov) for Menelaus" (48); and one is again reminded of those virginal loci amoeni cited above. There is, however, a difference between the Eurotas and the Nile. The former has a concreteness and a local familiarity which set it apart from the make-believe atmosphere of distant Egypt. Egypt, there- fore, is the ideal symbol for the exploration of the tensions between reality and appearance. It lies between Troy and Sparta, between mortals and gods, between a fabulous and an actual geography. Herodotus had impressed the stamp of his incomparable charm upon the remote and fanciful qualities, the 7TAEscT1a Ocuqaorta, which so de- lighted him in Egypt (2.3 5.1); and Euripides has exploited the imagina- tive and symbolical possibilities. The contrast between Egypt and Troy is also the contrast between Odyssey and Iliad. Indeed, Egypt's "lovely-maidened streams" of line i contrast sharply with the death-filled " streams of the Scamander" in lines 52-53: yvXavc of iToAAat S E`/L' E'TL LKaclav8plots poa tcrtv W'avov . . . The contrast is even more pointed for line 53, with its opening psychai pollai is surely meant to recall the proem of the Iliad and the "many strong souls of heroes" (pollas ... psychas) sent down to Hades by the war (Iliad I.3-4).6z This contrast between Troy and Egypt becomes a matter of visual and scenic effect when Teucer steps upon the stage.

Helen's allusion to " the fields of Nile" (NEIAov ... yvas, 89) both echoes the description of the prologue (3) and con- trasts with Teucer's description of the deaths at Troy (94 ff.). These antitheses between the romance-like Egyptian setting and the Trojan realities of exile and death are, in turn, another facet of the contrast between the " real'" Helen and the " death-dealing image'" (Et'KC Xovtov, 73) of the Trojan Helen whom Teucer fancies that he sees before him (73-75), or, differently put, between s9ma and phrenes (I60-6I). It is now clear that the play's central antithesis between appearance and reality has a number of different ramifications. The meaning of the Helen reveals itself in terms of this basic structure or core of anti- thesis, to which more and more elements are seen to cohere as analysis probes deeper. Those which have so far emerged can be presented in the following diagram: Reality Appearance Real Helen Eidolon Zeus Hera Beauty as positive good Beauty as a curse and source of strife (the three goddesses) Helen's removal to Egypt as Helen's removal to Egypt as rape protection phrenes soma (I6o-6i) Innocence Guilt Egypt Troy Odyssey Iliad Life ?- Persephone Death Myth (I73 ff., 243-45) This simplification should not suggest that the themes here presented in sequence are subordinate one to another. They are not so much logical deductions from a single antithesis as simultaneous aspects and expressions of that antithesis at other levels and in other areas. V Generally speaking, the male characters of the play stand on the nega- tive side of these antitheses, the female on the positive. The division is</page><page sequence="23">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 575 reminiscent of the Odyssey with the prominence which that poem gives to clever and mysterious women. But they are also related to the exotic flavor of the Egyptian setting. In this strange world the male, heroic values of mainland Greece, perpetually kept before us in the theme of the Trojan war, prove ineffectual and even encumbering. Hence Menelaus' discomfiture by the Portress is not just a bit of humorous stage-play, but dramatizes the alienness and inappropriate- ness of those martial, Trojan values which Menelaus embodies. The incongruity of the king in rags reflects not only a loss of personal identity, but a questioning of cultural identity. The opposition to war which this rejection of heroic values implies is part of a larger issue important in late fifth-century thought, an in- creasing movement away from the public toward the private realm.63 Within the public world of the polis action is the exclusive prerogative of men. Women have no place. In Euripides' fictional Egypt-as in Herodotus' "real" Egypt-the situation is just the reverse.64 The men may bluster and threaten, but the real power lies with the women. In the Lysistrata of the following year Aristophanes exploits a similar inversion and makes some of the same criticisms of traditional Greek values. In both these plays masculine aggressiveness has to yield place to the life-fostering, private, mysterious ways of women. In Euri- pides' play the hero whose"pride lies in the open challenge and the man-to-man conflict on the field of battle or (in fifth-century terms) in the straightforward shock and clash of matched lines of hoplites can be saved only by one woman s guile and another's complicity. Thus at the point when Menelaus is dissuaded from his initial impulse to violence, he hands the job of persuasion over to Helen as "woman's work" (orv Epyov, cu yvvatKt 7TpToqopov yvv r, 830). Menelaus is not, therefore, "merely a character of comedy through- out," as some have considered him.65 He has an essential function 63 For this subject in relation to Euripides see the useful remarks of Solmsen, "Ion," 453-56. 64Hdt. 2.35; Soph.

Just before his entrance Helen, in an extended lyrical passage (362-85), dwells on the horrors of Troy's fall. Menelaus enters in lines ringing with heroic names, as he boasts of his generalship and his forces at Troy (392-99). Almost casually he alludes to his destruction of the city (... Xp0'vov 7T'ErEp 'IAiov / 7T5p'yovs E'7Epoa, 401-2). His very first lines, with the refer- ence to the victory of Pelops at Olympia and the bed of Aerope calls up the darker side of heroic legends and the sins and violence in the great heroic families like the Tantalids. The "contests" which he mentions in his first two lines (especially the phrase c4dAAas E6ayuAArq6EsI, 387) express that confident masculine pride in action which is soon to receive so rude a shock. The first words he addresses to Helen allude to "contests" too; with his martial mentality he sees her movement toward the tomb as a kind of "contest" or "struggle" (',uAA-q,LEvlv, 546). Menelaus' monologue (483-514) after the fiasco with the Portress proves this blunt and simple warrior no match for the problems of " name and " act" raised in the Egyptian world (see onoma at 487, 490, 498).66 He falls back on the "simple name" of the heroic past (see a7TAoV-v be TvvA&amp;pELOV o'vop-a KA7jqETat, 494) and the renown of his name (502) as the one who "lit the glorious flames of Troy" (503-4): KAELVOV ro Tpot'as 7rVp Ey)/ 6 0oa vLv, MEV'Aaos, OVK 'KcL)/VUos ev F"av7 xS"" In a setting where war and Troy are called into question, an identity defined by Troy's fall is highly problematical.

Yet the mysteriousness of Egypt brings out all the latent oppositions and places them, at least part of the time, on opposite sides of the central dichotomies. The contrast between Helen's lament over the war and Menelaus' entrance (363-402) dramatizes differences to be richly developed in other ways.68 These differences appear especially sharply in the ways in which they use the words " glory," " disgrace," " shame" (kleos, aischyne', aid6s, and related words). For Menelaus, confused in an unfamiliar world, the certainty of his "Trojan glory" becomes virtually an obsession.69 The adjective kleinos appears in his opening lines and recurs frequently in his first scene (453, S02; cf. 494). His aischyne or aid6s lie in having lost his army, regal trappings, the external insignia of rank, for a beggar's rags (see 414-17). For Helen the case is exactly the reverse. Her kleos is aischron (135), and she laments its effects on her mother and daughter. She feels her aischyne bitterly (66-67, 20I-2, 687,697). She is 8VUKAE'4S' (270). Her onoma is a source of grief and pain (I99), not pride and comfort (cf. Menelaus at 502). Troy is the center of her aischyne' and dyskleia, as it is of Menelaus' confident kleos and "boasting" (KO'Iios9, 393). Helen is not, to be sure, entirely free of the theatrical heroics of Menelaus. She too wants to die "nobly" and gain doxa (see 298 and 841). 70 But this concern with her fame in the public world plays a much smaller role in her characterization than in her husband's. Be- hind it stands always an intense consciousness of shame. Euripides has built upon the self-consciousness and guilt of the Iliadic Helen,7' even though, in a typically Euripidean paradox, he is following the anti- Homeric version of her story. These contrasts cut below the surface of the two characters' situations to larger, representative attitudes behind them. Menelaus' orientation 68 See Matthiessen 69I-92.

The "contests" he mentions in his opening lines (386-87) are emblematic of his whole vision of the world. Helen's world-view has an inward dimension. This contrast is, in turn, an aspect of that between appearance and reality, "body" and "spirit" (see i6o-6i). The central section of the play defines the differences in a context of new urgency. Confronted with the problem of escaping from Egypt, Menelaus resorts to the rhetoric of Troy (a'vav8pac y' E tva s 'IAt'ov -T' OVK Ka'ta (8o8). He rejects any "shaming" of his kleos (845) or any "blame" (00byoso, 846) he might incur (also 948-49, 993). Helen, however, feels "shame" in a more deeply moral and inward sense (922), and speaks of the moral bases of her kleos (926-28): 'EAE/vrqv ydp OVEStEZ oU 0tOV rTVyEt flpoirW-v 17 KAV4Locat KaO' 'EAA6' us irpo6ovor' 4uov ITOULtv lpvyWv pK7Uoa 7ToAVXPVUoVS 8OjLOVS. One may contrast Menelaus' arTAoiv ... ovoLa KA7JcETat at 494 (cf also the messenger at 720-2I). A little later Helen even defines the "noblest fame" (kleos ... kalliston) as lying in ethical character (tropoi, 94I-43)- The couple's response to Theonoe follows the same pattern. Mene- laus threatens to stain Proteus' tomb " with streams of blood" (aitarosg poat, 984). The phrase suggests the violation of the sheltered serenity of Egypt's kalliparthenoi rhoai (line i). Helen, on the other hand, appeals to the memory and the goodness of Proteus (909-I6, 940-43) and invokes justice and morality throughout her speech (cf. 894-943, especially 919-23). Menelaus also calls on Proteus before he utters his threat (96I-68); but, characteristically, he stresses Proteus' kleos, his reputation, rather than his moral character (ev3KAEEoTaTov, 967; KaK&amp;JS' aKvorLat, 968). Menelaus' solution to the problem of escape is violent and, as Helen calmly points out, wildly unrealistic.72 He will "act" (cf. 8pw-vTas, 814) even if it means his death. 72 It is mistaken to regard this scene merely as "quite delightful comedy," as does Blaiklock go; so also Grube 344-45. The high pathos of the scene was enthusiastically appreciated by Wieland, who considered its "Ausdruck stiller Gr6sse, Gefiihl und Energie" moving "wie vielleicht keine andere Stelle in irgend einer Trag6die, die ich kenne" (i8o8): cited by Steiger 2II, who has a good discussion of the interplay of life and death in the passage (2I0-II).</page><page sequence="27">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 579 To this death-bent desperation Helen opposes the resiliency of Odyssean guile and adaptability. She plays Odysseus to Menelaus' Achilles. "Hope" (elpis, 8i5, 826), "device" (me'chane', 813), and "persuasion" (peithein, 825, 828) are the key words. The contrast of her "hope" and "persuasion" to Menelaus' "death" is especially marked in the stichomythies of 814-15 and 824-26. Though Helen agrees readily enough to the death-pact of 835-54, it is Menelaus who pronounces the decisive word, OaveLUOcat (836) and expounds the idea at length and with enthusiasm (842-54). Later, in a striking passage, Menelaus invokes Hades as an "ally": so many men has he sent there with his sword (969-71).73 In the deliberations which follow upon Theonoe's conversion to their cause, Menelaus again proposes violent and murderous expedients (1039-46). He finally acquiesces in Helen's sophia (I049-52), though his heart again warms to thoughts of an even- tual combat (I072). In both of these scenes of plotting Helen appears as the saving female figure of superior guile which Euripides had ex- ploited in the Iphigeneia in Tauris.74 Ironically, Euripides' innocent Helen has a model in her mythic opposite, the chaste Penelope. We can hardly expect that Menelaus, having sacked Troy for Helen's sake, will give her up easily (cf. 806). Even so, his possessiveness has a distinctly negative significance. His determination to keep the "real" Helen reenacts his earlier possessiveness toward the false: he clings to the real Helen with the same desperation and delusion with which he clings to the eidolon in the early part of the play. In the first case his possessiveness affirms a choice of appearance over reality. In the second it accompanies a choice of death over life. When Helen urges, "It is better to leave me than have my marriage bed kill you" (807), Menelaus adduces the honor of his Trojan success (8o8).75 His relation to both the real and false Helens brings together illusion, death, war, 73 The striking quality of Menelaus' rhetoric was warmly admired by Verrall I04: "Here is a grand bold handling of big ideas! Here is something to humble Aeschylus' Clytaemnestra and her cry to the fiends of Hell ...," citing Eumen. Io6. 74 See I. T. IOI7 ff., especially I032 on the technai of women. Theoclymenus at I62I complains that he has been "caught by women's technai."

The Menelauses of this world in a sense always cling to phantoms: life is full of prizes to be possessed, enemies to be killed, glory to be won. Yet after all their slaughter what they have in their hands may turn out to be an empty "cloud's image" (705)-unless a saving figure like Helen recalls them through her sophia to "hope" and the gentler remedies of "persuasion " and "'device." This division between husband and wife who so passionately desire reunion is another of the paradoxes created by the " two worlds " of the play. It is latent in the couple's very first scene together. In the other recognition plays of about this time, the Ion and the Iphigeneia in Tauris, the lost pair feels an instinctive affinity, a spontaneous communication between one another before they actually know who they are.76 This is a common feature of romance and is exploited, for example, by Shakespeare frequently in the late romances. In the Helen this feature of the recognition theme is lacking. Helen's first response is to flee in fear (541 ff.). Menelaus in turn indignantly rejects her advances when she realizes who he is (564 ff., especially 567). To some extent Euri- pides is simply varying the formula of anagnorisis. But the lack of the instinctive, subconscious recognition may also indicate a gulf separating the two characters. Despite their emotional ties, concep- tually they belong on different sides of the play's antithetical camps. Menelaus' recognition of Helen is, in fact, a double anagnorisis.77 The joyful discovery of his real wife is balanced by the grim, mocking discovery of the emptiness of the prize of war. All in vain, all for a phantom (704-10). Winning Helen back from the dangers of Egypt has a similar double aspect. The recognition of Helen and the challenge posed by her rescue revive the hero's lost identity. But this Trojan identity is in itself one of the problems framed by the play's antithetical structure. Menelaus holds to a potentially destructive, as well as to a saving aspect of his lost heroism. To regain Sparta, the heroic martial self which 76 See Alt 25 and in general I7-20 on the recognition scene. On the parallels and differences between the techniques of recognition in the Helen and the other plays of anagnorisis see also Solmsen, "Ion," 428 if.; Schadewaldt (above, note 65) 23-24; and most recently Peter Rau, Paratragodia.

The first stage of the process is the loss of the false Helen and with this the loss of the accoutrements of his Trojan identity. The eidolon of the false Helen leaves of its own accord. The real Helen, in the second stage of the process, becomes the active figure. She will lead through a symbolical ordeal of death and rebirth (1049-52) the warrior who brings death and fire to cities and calls upon Hades (969 ff.). In the parode Helen is likened to the divinities of nature, Nymphs and Naiads who sing of Pan's marriage (i86-90). She offers tears of grief to Persephone (I73-78), but she herself is like the Maiden carried to the Underworld (see 243-5I) who, as a later ode assures us, returns to the upper world amid the rejoicing of all nature (I30 ff.). The figure of Helen is itself a survival of a Mycenaean (or earlier) vegetation goddess and was so worshipped at Sparta.78 On one level her Egyp- tian confinement preserves her purity (see 48); but on another it is a kind of living death for her, as she in fact says (-rO tS vpayE1autv -LJUVTEVKa, TrotS' 9 epyOtctV OV', 286). Euripides, with his repeated references to Persephone here and his interest in primitive cults in the later years of his life (especially in the I.T. and Bacchae), may have known of this aspect of Helen and incorporated it into the structure of his play. Helen appears both as the grieving, bereft Mother who mourns her dead consort and as the Daughter or Maiden whose restoration re- vivifies in its train the sources of life hidden under the earth. Menelaus, she laments, was " among the corpses under the ground" (344). When he finally casts off the spell of the phantom Helen, his life is "renewed," as the messenger's joyful words imply (722-25): vvv avavEov,Lat L oV aOV VIEvatov 7TaAtv KAaE Aa 'Scr&amp;ovzvLV7/EO' &amp;gs TETpaopot!s ffrotS' roxaC,v 7TapE`Epov- a' 8' 'v lopotS OvV '7-WSE VV,U+7v &amp;i4L' 'AEET!ES 6'APtOV.

When the messenger again addresses Menelaus it is with a new respect for his authority: he calls him, for the first time by the Homeric title, "lord," anax (744), having previously addressed him only as "Menelaus" (599, 700). Helen is not herself entirely free from delusion. Despite her confi- dent defense of herself against Teucer's inversion of appearance and reality (i I8-22), she becomes-like Teucer and Menelaus-a victim of this confusion too (576-go). She herself suffers the pain of "seeming to have, not having" (592; cf. 35-36, 6II, 705-6). But this state is short-lived for her. It is her power to manipulate illusion and reality, logos and ergon, that secures true "life" for herself and her husband (I049-52). It is she, for example, who administers to Menelaus the bath and the change of garment (I382-84). Here too the ritually enacted restoration of life is combined with the ancient theme of the renewal of the maimed, weakened, or otherwise impotent king. Like some of Shakespeare's heroines (one thinks of Portia in the Merchant of Venice or Helena in All's Well That Ends Well), she is the leader in the game of interchanging appearance and reality. She is herself the principal force in the rhythm which carries the action from sterility to union, sorrow to joy. Her powers are natural and feminine rather than magical; but she stands on the lower rung of a ladder which leads to Shakespeare's Prospero. And behind her, mysteriously en- larging her stature and significance, stands the great archetype of Persephone, whose " doublet" Helen's Mycenaean original was. With these contrasts between Menelaus and Helen we may extend the diagram of antitheses as follows: Helen Reality Feminine values Odyssey Peace Egypt Shame over Troy Private realm Inward life (cf. I60-6I) Unselfishness (cf 805-7) Persuasion, hope, device Rebirtli (Persephone) Menelaus Illusion Masculine values Iliad War Troy Glory in Troy Public realm Outward action Possessiveness Force Death</page><page sequence="31">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 583 VI Theoclymenus stands on the same side of these antitheses as Menelaus. His dominant traits are violence and delusion. The first time that he is mentioned Helen describes him as " hunting " for her marriage (Oqpa- yaFLELv FLE, 63). On his next appearance, that hunting is literal rather than metaphorical, and it is bloody as well: "He's away," says Helen, EV kovatls 0KpOKrTO'VOlS' (I54). The bloodthirstiness continues in the next line, which extends the killing (-ktonos) to bigger game: " For he kills (kteinei) whatever stranger from Greece he lays hands upon (i 55). Hunting recurs (Op-pa-, s4s) and is combined with an allusion to "savagery" ('yptos~, 544) when Helen espies the rude-appearing Menelaus and takes him for an agent of Theoclymenus (544-45). These passages prepare our expectations for Theoclymenus' actual appearance on stage. After a brief address to his father's tomb he speaks of "nooses for wild beasts" (iI69) and shortly thereafter of punishing wrongdoers with death (II 72). The hunting image returns at 98i (Opa^), II69 and II75 (Orp60iEvov), with "death" following in the next line (I I76).79 Thinking that Helen has escaped, he calls loudly for horses and chariots (iI80-83), only to check himself a moment later: "Hold, for I see those we are pursuing here in the halls and not in flight" (iI84-85). There is humor here, of course, but there is a serious thematic relevance too. Like Menelaus (808-54 and I039-52), Theoclymenus rushes precipitately to violent deeds and then, rather sheepishly, has to retreat. Like Menelaus too, he exemplifies the inadequacy of heroic values even in the kingdom over which he rules. His opening obeisance to his father's tomb, comic as it may seem,8o 79 Theoclymenus has affinities with the figure of the "black hunter" discussed by P. Vidal-Naquet, "Le chasseur noir et l'origine de l'ephebie athenienne," Annales. Economies, Societies, Civilisations (I968) 947-64; English version in PCPS I94 (I968) 49-64. 80 R. P. Winnington-Ingram, "Euripides, Poietes Sophos," Arethusa 2 (I969) I3I, ingeniously suggests that Euripides here intends "a hit at the conventional treatment of locality in the Choephori . . ." For the lighter view of Theoclymenus in general see Verrall 52 ff., and Steiger 2I2-I6: to the latter the last third of the play is all comic parody, an "Uberlistungskom6die." Kannicht I.69-7I sees the deception of Theo- clymenus as the tragicomic inversion of the tragic split between truth and appearance in the first half of the play.</page><page sequence="32">584 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I also has a function in the structure of the play. It exhibits that same kind of material possessiveness as Menelaus expressed toward Helen in 806-54. Theoclymenus needs the tangible remains of Proteus at his very doors for his daily salute. The idea is grotesque, and Euripides is doubtless having fun with the figure of the exotic king on the tragic stage. Theoclymenus completely fulfils the possibilities of a bizarre, outre' idiosyncrasy that one might expect of an Egyptian monarch.8i Not only does Theoclymenus' material piety contrast markedly with the piety of his sister (see below), but it also plays directly into Helen's hands. Lacking the inward spirit of piety, he is taken in by its external trappings. The burial of Menelaus, with its ritual overtones of puri- fication and rebirth, holds no mystery for him. Rather, it provides him with an opportunity to show off his wealth and to bind Helen to him (as he thinks) a little more securely. He sees in her pious act only the personal advantage of having a docile and obedient wife. "It's to our interest to bring up a pious wife," he says in I278. To underline the contrast between his conception of piety and the other dimensions of religion in the play, the fabula sacra of the Mountain Mother of the Gods follows almost immediately (I30I ff.). In one important respect Theoclymenus differs from Menelaus. He is to lose Helen. Losing Helen, he is never quite to emerge from the cloud of delusion, or at least not until the deus ex machina intervenes. When the messenger reports Helen's flight, he asks, "Did she go off lifted on wings or with earth-treading foot" (i5i6). As noted earlier (see above, p. 568), the phrase mTEpOlUrv apOELta recalls the disappear- ance of the "false" Helen who "disappeared lifted off (acp0E-ra) into the aether's folds" (6o5-6). The echo suggests that Theoclymenus regresses into the unreality of the eidolon theme in the first half of the play. He reenacts Menelaus' earlier confusion between appearance and reality. Though the Dioscuri enlighten him at the end, the last picture we have of him before he rushes off with murderous thoughts is of a man deceived. The chorus, loyal to Helen's request for silence (I387-89), glibly lies, "I never would have thought that Menelaus could have escaped our notice .. ." (I6I9-20). The last scene extends Theoclymenus' delusion to the moral realm. 81 Bacon overlooks this possibility, I think, in her discussion of the tomb and the religious customs of the Egyptians in the Helen: pp. I37-38, I48-49, I53-54.</page><page sequence="33">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 585 His "justice" and "piety" both belong to "appearance" (i627-38).82 It is in keeping with his earlier behavior that a flurry of words for "death" and "killing" immediately precedes the entrance of the Dioscuri (I639-4I). At the very end he is permitted to recognize the true virtue of Helen (Jpl&amp;rr7, UoJc0povEoTcrTa'Tq, I684). But even this closing statement contains a wry irony which keeps him, despite divine enlightenment, still in the beclouded and rather comic role approaching that of the mari cocu. He congratulates Helen on her EvyEvErTcaTr7s' yVa@rjS' (I686-87), and adds, 7 ToAAats Ev yvvate'v OVK 'Vt (I687). The remark may be appropriate, but its tone of worldly cynicism is amusingly out of place on the lips of a man who has been deceived and betrayed by practically every female character of the play.83 One is left a bit uncertain as to whether he is expressing in I687 some newly discovered truth about the feminine nature or whether he is trying to salvage masculine pride by claiming a knowledge of the ways of the world which he has fancied himself possessing all along. The foil to Theoclymenus is, of course, Theonoe. She is associated, as Zuntz and Burnett have shown, with a supra-human cosmic wisdom and with a pure, spiritual conception of the gods which contrasts with the delusions of the other characters and with the petty jealousies of the anthropomorphism presented in the prologue and elsewhere.84 She stands clearly on the side of "reality" and far from the "appearances" in which her brother is enmeshed. Her piety, though "not seeming" SO (OV3 8OKOV^0' 0'LWSg, I020), is vindicated as truth at the end. The Dioscuri's praise of her just and righteous action (I647-49, I656-67) cancels Theoclymenus' vilification (kakiste (i632)).85 Theonoe contrasts not only with Theoclymenus, but also with Menelaus. Her entrance in a blaze of light which signifies both rebirth and purity (865-72) follows closely upon Menelaus' violent resolution 82 See Burnett i6i. 83 The only possible exception is the Portress; but even she, in a sense, fails Theocly- menus. For all her stern words to Menelaus, she does not in fact betray him to the king. In her exit lines, in fact, she professes good will to the Greeks and apologizes for the "bitter words" which she spoke out of fear for her master (482-83). On Theocly- menus and the role of the deceived husband see also Burnett I 54. 84 See Burnett I57-59; Conacher 294-97 and 30I-2; Kannicht I.7I-7; Pohlenz I.386-89; Post ioi-2; Verrall 59; Zuntz 204, 2I3-I6. 85 Note too Theoclymenus' denial of the servant's eusebestate in I632-33.</page><page sequence="34">586 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I of the death-pact (836-54).86 Her serenity and the vast scope of her mind, reaching out to the aether and "the pure breath of heaven's recesses" (866-67), stand out in sharp relief against the death-bent, Hades-invoking anxieties of the Trojan hero (cf. 863-64). The kleos sought by her defender, the servant, at the end of the play (I640-4I) is very different from the martial, Troy-based kleos on which Menelaus stakes his identity. Her celebrated meditation of a "deathless gnonme" which dwells in the "immortal aether" (IOI3-I6) is, as Verrall put it, a gentle reproof to "the soulless philosophy of Menelaus." 87 Whereas Theoclymenus needs to have his father's tomb at the very entrance to his palace, Theonoe's piety soars into the highest reaches of the cosmos (866-67). She, in fact, proves a far more effective protector of this tomb against the threats of Menelaus' desperate violence (980- 90). In her affinity with the highest and purest "reality'" and her distance from the narrow, possessive localism of the two male characters (or three, if Teucer is included), Theonoe deepens the antithesis between male and female, martial prowess and life-giving, feminine gentleness, with a further contrast between materialism and vast philosophical perspective. Her presence embodies an opposition between intellect, abstract thought, mysticism, the eternal creations of the spirit on the one hand and force, bloodshed, war on the other. Her philosophical nature, as well as her femininity, separates her from the active, competitive, exclusively male functions of the polis with which Theoclymenus and Menelaus are associated. Theoclymenus' conception of justice, for example, is to exact physical and indeed capital punishment like a judge in a real polis (cf. dikazein, I637). Theonoe, however, conceives of punishment (tisis) in the broad philo- sophical terms which extend to an afterlife and to a consciousness which cannot die (IOI3-I6). This antinomy between the two sets of characters foreshadows some aspects of Plato's struggles between the bios politikos and the bios 86 Grube 344, note i, suggests a parallel with the appearance of the Delphian priestess in the Ion. 87 Verrall io6.

In Aristophanes' Birds the polis and the human nomoi are full of corrup- tion, informers, and the joyless complexities of polypragmosyne', while the imaginary Cloud-city exists in a gentle and benign realm of physis where the mythical violence of Tereus becomes the songful reasonable- ness of the Hoopoe. Similar criticisms of the limited horizons of the polis appear around the same time in Aristophanes' Lysistrata, in Hippias, in Democritus, and in the Truth of Antiphon the Sophist.89 In Euripides' own work of this period there is also Ion's famous speech on the evils and dangers of the public life of the polis (Ion 585-6o6, 62I-47), and reinforcing it the warning example of Creusa's patrician exclusiveness and possessiveness with their nearly disastrous conse- quences (Ion I29I-I305; cf. also 589-93). As the embodiment of the highest reality ("pure uplift," remarked L. A. Post),90 Theonoe is also the high point of the contrast between Egypt and Troy. If Theoclymenus leaves the suspended otherworld- liness of Egypt somewhat tarnished, Theonoe portrays whatever is best in it. His buffoonish figure suggests the scorn that a decadent kingdom could arouse in the Greek mind, as in the story of Busiris, whereas her Egypt is the repository of the ancient mystical wisdom of the East.9' The Egypt which surrounds her is a kind of ideal state harking back to the benign monarchy of Proteus, a Prospero's island in which she is Ariel to Theoclymenus' Caliban. Her maidenhood is the badge of her purity. Even before we hear her name, she is called parthenos (io), as she is throughout the play.92 As the " maiden " par excellence, she thus 88 See, for example, Werner Jaeger, " IUber Ursprung und Kreislauf des philosophi- schen Lebensideals," SBBerlin (I928) 390-42I. Zuntz 2i5-i6 well observes the contrast between the common-sense intelligence of the "man-in-the-street" at 744-57 and the cosmic, mystical wisdom of Theonoe. 89 See in general H. C.

The purity and brilliance which flash forth at her entrance (865-72) unite the two main aspects of the reality-appearance antithesis, the ethical and the epistemological. This brightness signifies a lucid truth in contrast with the murky cloudedness of Troy, but it also signifies the hope of life and rebirth. The recognition scene in which occur the first movements out of delusion begins with Helen's appeal to Theo- noe's knowledge ("she who knows everything truly," 530); and Helen's next words show us this knowledge in the service of light, life, and rebirth (530-3 I): 77aFZ ?' Ev spa'E 7rOCLV Tov auLov twvra bE'yyoS Etcopav ... Correspondingly, Theonoe's "purity" in 865-67 is both moral and intellectual. It combines both freedom from delusion and freedom from passion. It is inward as well as outward, for it involves her body (parthenos) as well as her soul. We may contrast Theoclymenus' concern with the "outward" purity of his house when he reflects that Menelaus has not died in Egypt: KaOapa 'yap ?5tv 8&amp;o4ara (I430). In her the wisdom of thephysiologos and the justice of the agathos are one and the same. The tension between Theonoe and Theoclymenus, and hence be- tween reality and appearance, also involves the question of which of them truly embodies the spirit of Egypt and which is truly the repre- sentative of the pious and good dead king, Proteus. The "higher" reality of Egypt, as Euripides makes clear, belongs to Theonoe. Not only does her maidenhood have a kinship with Egypt's "maiden- lovely streams" in the first line, but she too is associated with the distant, mysterious atmosphere of the sea and its mythical denizens in the opening lines (4-8). It is she who "has honor from her ancestor Nereus" (i5) and is called "the maiden descended from the Nereid of the sea" (3I8; cf. I647). Theoclymenus, of course, has an equal title to this marine ancestry (e.g., 8), but he is never described in these mythological terms. He prides himself on being the devoted son of Proteus, as his opening words show (II67-68):</page><page sequence="37">Vol. 102] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 589 , ' CF t X sf K ' CF aLE E EcL&amp;v Te KcaLUUJv Oo/jLovs- @9OKAV/.EVOS Irats o'SE 7TpOUEVVE'Et, IaTEp. But, as we have seen, it is Theonoe who proves to have the more legitimate claims to filial piety and to the spirit of Proteus (see I028-29). She is, as Verrall remarked, "essentially his representative."93 Her inward "shrine of justice" (I003-4) is a more authentic memorial to Proteus than the ostentatious tomb which Theoclymenus has erected for his daily salute (i i65-68).94 In the speech of the Dioscuri at the end Theonoe shares with Helen the virtue ofsaphrosgne (I657, I684); and it was for sophrosgne that Zeus had singled out Proteus beyond all mortals (47). Although Theonoe's virginity stands at the opposite pole from Helen's experience,95 the two women are not in all respect opposites. Dramatically Helen is the more complex. Theonoe will remain in her removed and mystical sea-realm. Helen has to return to the complexi- ties of the human world where Menelaus is king. Yet Helen can also speak Theonoe's language as can no other charac- ter in the play. In striking contrast to Menelaus, she appeals to Theonoe's purer conception of justice (920-2I, 940-43), the divine (903, 9I4-23), and piety (900-9oI, 9I4-2I). She can also rise to a generosity and universalism of thought that match Theonoe's. In 906-7 Helen speaks of the "heavens and earth common to all mortals," where we are reminded of Theonoe's opening statement (866-67) and her philosophical dictum of IOI3-I6. To Theoclymenus' casual dis- missal of care for the dead as nothing but trouble, Helen answers with a riddling line on the existence of the dead "there as well as here" (I42I-22): 9E. 1aa icov Oavovrcov ov Ev, aA a"A' co As7ovos.

For a cautious approach to Theonoe's "shrine of justice" see Matthiessen 702-3. Cf. also lines I648-49. 95 Griffith 39 observes that Helen begins and ends with an address to Theonoe as " virgin," and comments that it is "not perhaps overtactful of her to stress poor Theo- noe's spinsterhood." Theonoe, however, would probably not have been displeased, and Griffith's comment is somewhat in the direction of the "documentary fallacy."</page><page sequence="38">590 CHARLES SEGAL [I971 recognition of an equivalent realm of the "beyond" has affinities with Theonoe's remarks of IOI3-6.96 It may be somewhat amusing to find Helen criticizing Aphrodite for her excesses (II02-6). Yet the scene also shows her capable of a Gotterkritik not unlike Theonoe's. Helen can also understand "God" in a mysterious, almost allegorical way. "God," she says, "is to know those dear to you" (OE0s yap Kat ro yLyVWUKELV bAovg, 560). As Theonoe possesses an inward world of spirituality and piety and has a "shrine ofjustice" in her nature (I002- 3),97 so Helen too has vindicated her inward being, her phrenes, against the crimes attaching to the external image, the ELKLt /o'vtOv (73) of her supposed body (see i6o-6i). Both women, finally, are united in the last pronouncement of Theoclymenus in the finale (I680-87). In a sense Theonoe is Helen's purer self, the ultimate reality with which Helen is in touch, albeit not as steadily as Theonoe. If Theonoe points to that higher reality in the realm of morality, theology, and philosophical and religious thought, Helen touches it in the realm of grace, beauty, and art. The two figures are comple- mentary images of man's striving for spiritual strength and unity. Helen's position is naturally the more complex, for she mediates be- tween reality and appearance as Theonoe does not and has to suffer the complication of her identity through the existence of a licentious other self The motif of the aether forms another link between the two women. Like Helen herself, the aether occupies a middle position between reality and appearance. The eidolon-destructive, deceptive, lustful (cf. E'KC % vtov, 73)-goes off finally into its kindred aether, leaving Helen free and innocent (see 584, 6o5, I2I9).98 In this aspect the aether is connected with the emptiness and delusiveness of clouds and wind (cf. Hera's EqVE'1LWUsE, 32, and also 44, 705-6, I2I9-20) or with the passion of the gods (2I6). The aether of which Theonoe speaks, 96 For the interpretation of I422 (too easily given up as hopeless by Dale) see Kannicht ad loc. See also Helen's somewhat riddling juxtaposition of living and dead in 9I2-I3. 97 Theonoe's 71E'fVKa at 998 indicates, I believe, that the physis of I002-3 means "her nature" and not "nature," "human nature," in general. 98 Cf. also 6I3, where the eidolon goes off waTEp ES ovpavov; and compare the eidolon's d'arpwv.. .

Helen's eidolon is composed of "sky" (oipavov eVVOE_t' a'Sro, 34) and is a creation of Hera's jealousy and spite (see 3I-36). Theonoe's "sky" is associated with the "pure breath" (pneumna, 768) of heaven and thus has affinities with bold philo- sophical concepts like the nous of Anaxagoras or Diogenes.99 The one stands in the mythical tradition of the poets' cloud-images of lust and deception, like that of Pindar in the second Pythian, so brilliantly ex- ploited by Aristophanes in the decade before the Helen.'00 The other belongs in a speculative tradition reaching back to the philosophers of Ionia. This positive, philosophical meaning of aether occurs elsewhere in the play in connection with a more benign conception of the gods. In the ode on the Mountain Mother the Dionysian dance which shakes Olympus and announces the joy of nature's life reborn is a KV'KALoS 1 voLs E cLLOEp'a (I363). In the third and last stasimon the chorus calls on the Dioscuri "who dwell in the heavens" (ouranioi, I499) to come " rushing through the aether (di' aitheros, I496), thus healing the effects Zeus' rape of Leda and of Hermes' "abduction" of Helen which had been described with the same words in 2I6 and 246 respectively. The antitheses focused by the contrasts between Theonoe and the male characters expand the range of the central antithesis even further, and they may be diagrammed as follows: Theonoe Theoclymenus (and Menelaus) Philosophical conception of God Anthropomorphic gods (cf 708) (ta theia) Purity and virginity Lust Inward morality (cf I003) External morality (cf. I626-4I) True respect for Proteus Seeming respect for Proteus Piety in spirit Piety in outward forms Cosmic and universalistic pers- Narrow possessiveness and localism pective Punishment after death and Corporeal punishment, physical death " immortal gnome " 99 For the relevant fragments and discussion see Matthiessen 699-702; also Burnett i6o-6I; Post I03; Griffith 40. 100 For the deceptive cloud-image in early mythology see the useful discussion in Kaiunicbt I.33-38.</page><page sequence="40">592 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I Aether as a permanent and divine substance Aether as transient and deceptive cloud-image VII The balance between Theonoe and Helen is a microcosm of the whole play's balance between the intellectualist antitheses of appearance and reality on the one hand and the archetypal themes of romance on the other. Helen has the major role in uniting these two sides of the play, for she is simultaneously the mysterious female ministrant to life and rebirth and the focus of the confusion between appearance and reality. But Theonoe and Proteus also contribute to uniting these two strands. As the father of Theonoe, Proteus has a natural place on the philo- sophical or intellectualist side of the play. He is the remoter source of the " real" justice and piety which are finally vindicated in the person of Theonoe. But from the very beginning he also introduces the major archetypal motif, death and rebirth. He is himself an example of a "maimed" king whose authority has now become impotent with the ascension of his successor. Theonoe's decision to aid Helen and reject apparent for real respect for her father restores something of the old king's moral and spiritual vitality (cf. I020-2I and Theonoe's address thereafter to her "dead father" I028-29). At the beginning of the action Helen lamented that she was safe as long as Proteus "saw this light of the sun "; but now Proteus is dead, " hidden in the darkness of the earth" (yp ucKOd-r(O KEiKpv-Tat, 6I-62). This last phrase connects Proteus with the imagery of the ensuing Persephone ode (i68 ff.) and with the supposed death of Menelaus whom she fears "among the corpses under the earth" (Ev v'cv X0uvOa, x 344) or "in the dark- ness hidden under the earth" (otXErat / 0 E'pE/o3s XOov' KpVOO6tS', 5I8-Ig). Menelaus' situation is, in part, that of Proteus: in both cases a "dead" king's authority has to be restored. In Proteus' case, of course, the restoration is possible only in a metaphorical and spiritual sense, as is appropriate for the father of Theonoe. His moral and figurative rebirth through Theonoe's inward struggle and decision is both a parallel and a foil to the more primitive ritual of rebirth through which Menelaus has, physically, to pass.</page><page sequence="41">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 593 Proteus also stands behind the action as a symbol of the possibility of achieving a victory over death. His tomb is a visual reminder of the living power of the dead. It exercises a beneficent effect on the living. Helen observes that it has saved her "like the temples of the gods" (8oi). The motif of death and rebirth not only governs the rhythm of the action, but also helps clarify the ethical side of the play's antitheses. When Teucer early in the play says that Troy has been sacked "for seven fruitful circles ofyears" (TJmra XE80oV TL Kapm7TlOVSg ETWV KVK- Aovs, I I2), he is not just indulging in a poetic periphrasis, but setting the theme of Troy and war into the larger archetypal framework of the action (compare the references to the "green shoots" in the parode, I 8o and 243, and, of course, the Persephone myth there). The myth of Persephone and the renewal of the impotent king are the archetypal myths behind the situations of Helen and Menelaus re- spectively. The movement between life and death and upper and lower worlds runs through the early part of the play (see 6I-62, 286, 344, 5 I8-I9, 529-30) and culminates in the "renewal" (avavEoVlLac) of Menelaus' marriage amid the torches of the wedding celebration (722-24). As husband and wife soon realize, this rebirth is only partial. Mene- laus' violent threats and especially the death-pact, which comes exactly in the middle of the play (835-54 in a work of I692 lines), turns the joy of reunion to their deepest immersion in death. The fact that they will execute this pact on the tomb (842, the first line of Menelaus' de- velopment of the idea) is a further negation of the hoped for revivifi- cation of the powers of the dead king, Proteus. The speech in which the desperate Menelaus threatens to defile the tomb with "streams of blood" (984-85, a passage which, incidentally, echoes his initial ex- position of the death-pact: cf. Tv,u/ov301 'it vWTr / vWrots in 984 and 842) begins with the address to Hades as his ally. It is also at this point in the play that Menelaus is most deeply held by the " glory of Troy" and the forces of death which it signifies. Here Menelaus does, in fact, stand in the realm of death, in a deeper and more "real" sense than Helen realizes when she speaks of his sup- posed literal "death" earlier (see 344, 5I8-I9). Theonoe, with her light-bringing torches (865-72) and her talk of immortality (IOI3-I6),</page><page sequence="42">594 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I swings the balance back to the side of life. She is seconded by Helen, who appeals to the living moral power of Proteus. If Menelaus were dead, how, she asks, would Proteus' charge be fulfilled (9I0-12)? "How would he give what is living to the dead" (9I3)?IOI And in her next lines she couples "the god" with the "dead" father (7ra -rov- OEOV Ka tc 7rC a-oV prac-p, 9I4-15). Theonoe's decision to help the couple is also an affirmation of Proteus' "life": "If he were alive, he would give her back to you," she tells Menelaus in ioiI-12. It is immediately after this statement that she makes her famous pronounce- ment on the immortal consciousness of the dead in the deathless aether (IOI3-I6). Here Proteus is not only "reborn" as a life-giving force in the world, but his "life'" appears as part of a vast process of cosmic renewal far transcending the individual and physical rebirth which Helen and Menelaus seek.I02 The spiritual and ritual or philosophical and archetypal forms of rebirth reinforce one another in that same balance which Helen and Theonoe hold between them. The two sides of the rebirth theme exemplified in the two women are complementary aspects of Euripides' complex vision of human life, held in an eternal counterpoise between ideality and actuality, abstract thought and primitive energy, mind and nature. After this midpoint of life and death and this glimpse of rebirth in the boldest, most imaginative terms (IOI3-I6), Helen replaces Theonoe as the play's genius of new life. The ritual death of Menelaus is also connected with the theme of purification (note the carrying off of the Av4ca7-a, 1271). In finally freeing himself of Troy, Menelaus moves a little closer to that "pure" world which Theonoe inhabits, even though his " purification " follows an archaic ritual quite remote from the developed spiritual and philo- sophical "purity" of Theonoe. As the eidolon freed Helen from the burden of past guilt and shame, this purification frees Menelaus, at least in part, from the suffering of his Trojan past. He too can now take a part in the manipulation of appearance and reality, using the 101IKEVQS' in 9I2 should be Hermes, but one wonders whether it may refer to Proteus, as the dead king whose force is still felt in the world of the living. 102 See Matthiessen 693-94.</page><page sequence="43">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 595 terms " living " and " dead " in the riddling way that points toward the escape from these inversions (see I289-90). The ode on the Mountain Mother of the Gods (I30i-68) is the cul- minating point of this theme of rebirth.103 It comes just at the point when the reality and the appearance of life and death have been re- versed. Shortly before the ode Theoclymenus, attempting in his rather heavy-handed way to console Helen, assures her that "the husband who is dead would not be able to come alive" (I285-87). Menelaus then takes up this play on hiis own supposed death and life (I288-89). This ode is the mirror-image of the parode.104 It resumes and com- pletes the motif of Persephone there stated and reflects the reversal which has occurred in the interim. In the parode Persephone is in the underworld (I73-78). The indirect allusion to her rape in 243-46 suggests that the long desolate period of her sojourn under the earth (corresponding to Helen's long, lonely sojourn in Egypt) is about to begin. The Mountain Mother ode also speaks of Persephone's rape (ap7Tayyas 0Aiovs, 1322), using the same word which was used of Helen (50, 246). Its main point, however, is the return of Persephone and the renewed joy of nature.'05 Its movement is not from joy to grief, as is implicit in 243-46, but from grief to joy, from Iype (I344) to terpsis (I 3 52). i06 This movement from the parode to the second stasimon crystallizes what has been in effect the movement of the entire plot, whiclh is in turn the cyclical movement from Winter to Summer characteristic of 103 Earlier critics tended to regard the ode as totally irrelevant. Hermann ad I376 considered it an actor's interpolation. Verrall 64 found it "absolutely irrelevant" and saw in it nothing but "a poet's compliment to the poetry and popular features of the legend and the celebration, that and nothing more" (I08). Similarly Schmid So6 and SI3-I4 (with useful bibliography); Grube 349; and now even Dale xiii ("scarcely a pre- tence of relevance to the events on stage"). Golann provides a useful survey of previous views, but his own interpretation is unsatisfactory. Recent interpretation has had better success: see Burnett I55-56; Conacher 300-30I; Lattimore 53; Zuntz 226-27. 104 Note the echo of the parode's ALKaK... XAOLav (I80) and XAoEpa (243) in a'XAoa ITE8&amp;c yds (I327) and XAO'a (I360). 105 Golann's view (34 if.) that the ode does not refer to Demeter and Persephone, but rather to the cult of Helen is implausible. By the late fifth century the syncretism of Demeter and Cybele was well advanced: see Soph., Phil. 39I ff. and in general Nilsson Gesch. (above, note 78) 725-27. 106 Note also Zeus' help to " nmother earth" in the prologue, 40 if.</page><page sequence="44">596 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I romance.'07 Yet here too the rhythm of romance blends with the intellectualist themes of the play. In the early part of the play the inversions of life and death are fused with those of appearance and reality and have a negative significance for the protagonists. Now, however, as Helen and Menelaus themselves manipulate both of these inversions (Io49-52, I287-89), they have a positive significance. "Appearance" and "death" become the main instrument of their achievement of new life. The life-death themes stated mythically in the ode continue in the action which immediately follows it. Helen explains how Theonoe has kept her promise, acceding to the lie that Menelaus is " dead in the earth and does not see the light" (I372-73).bI8 Helen then describes how she changed his castaway's rags for a new cloak (I 382), a change of garment signifying a renewal of identity (see also I296-97), as Helen's own change from white to black (I087, II86-87) accompanies her saving manipulation of life and death, reality and appearance. She washes Menelaus in pure river water (I 384), thereby not only effecting the ritual transition from the death-dealing sea to life, but also con- tinuing the cosmic rebirth of the Mountain Mother ode. Helen's language in I384, xP'vta v'-iT'rpa rToracqas Sp&amp;ov, echoes the language of the ode some fifty lines before (I335-37): wInyaS' o atLTaveL spocEpads AEVK63V EKJa3cAAEtV 65&amp;a'Tv TEVYEL oatoS' aAoJrrcop. The "white water" (AEVKJ- V ... voarwv, 1336) also takes up the ulti- mately life-giving black-white inversion of Helen's ruse (I087, iI86- 87). In the exchange of garments scenic effect and underlying mythic structure are again at one. Earlier, at the nadir of his fortunes, Mene- laus stood in rags before the palace gate and felt a hero's shame (aischyne, aidds) for his wretched garb (4I6-I7). His attempt to conceal it (4I7) was a futile and premature movement out of his reduced state. He is, 107 See Frye, Anatomy (above, note 20) I82-83; A Natural Perspective (above, note i8) 57ff. 108 The phrase Ev xovi suggests the chthonic themes connected with death and the underworld at the beginning of the play: see I68, 344, 5i8-i9. Murray and Dale, however, are suspicious of the phrase; but it seems not to trouble Kannicht.</page><page sequence="45">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 597 at this point, still preoccupied with "appearances" and still possesses the "false" Helen and all that she symbolizes. Giving up his rags, he also gives up something from the world of heroic vicissitudes (tyche, 417) in which he gained them. Ineffectual in this strange realm, some- what like the shipwrecked sailors of the Tempest, he has to relinquish his regal and heroic scruples in matters of clothing (4I6-17) as of action (cf. IO5o-52); and, like a mystic initiate, he must put himself into the hands of a mysterious power to be reborn. Even here, however, there is still a distinction between Helen as dis- penser of life and Menelaus as the violent soldier who has come from the death-filled atmosphere of Troy. While Menelaus "practises' (nuK1uaaro, i379) with arms, Helen "decks him out" (E'6u,Kqua, 1383) with the change of clothing. The two characteristic actions, one feminine and life-giving, the other masculine and martial, are now brought together in the same verb. Though still indicative of oppos- ing attitudes, the two gestures are both working toward the same end. Antithesis has become complementation. The union of contraries here holds out the promise of a fuller union in Sparta. The third stasimon, sung as Helen and Menelaus exit for the last time, continues the themes of cosmic rebirth from the Mountain Mother ode, but localizes them in a more directly personal situation. The movement from sorrow and death to the joy of a new life now takes place not on remote Olympus, but in the local Laconian festival of the Hyacinthia (1465-75). The death of Hyacinthus becomes the occasion for the "nocturnal joy" of the festal dance (vvixtov E's Ev"bpoovvav, 1468-70). Hyacinthus, like Helen and Persephone, is connected with the death and rebirth of vegetation. The Hyacinthia was primarily a fertility festival.109 Hence this allusion to his cult continues the rhythmic movement of renewal after sterility. There is perhaps the further intimation, as in the Odyssey, that the union of the king and queen in their own land, performing the rites which fall to their office, ushers in the fertility of which the land has been doubly deprived while both its kind and its Persephone-like queen have been held in the realm of 109 See Nilsson, Myc.

In other ways too the cosmic myth of the return of Persephone echoes the private circumstances of Helen and Menelaus. The mar- riage of their daughter, previously thwarted by the shame of Helen (see 688-go), is anticipated in the blazing marriage torches of this third stasimon (I476-77). Yet the larger cosmic themes are not forgotten, for the chorus refers to Hermione as the "heifer" ( ,oLqxov, I476), a word which suggests the connection of the human and natural worlds in a large, all-embracing rhythm. The themes of life and rebirth here remain combined with those of reality and appearance. This real marriage of Hermione contrasts with Theoclymenus' delusion of marriage with Helen (I430-35). When he says shortly before that his house is "clean" (kathara) because Menelaus did not die there (I430-3 I) and that " all the earth should cry out with happy hymnals of Helen's and [his] marriage" (I433-35), he is ironi- cally echoing the couple's real "cleansing" of the past and the reality of the cosmic rebirth that accompanies their union (see 1327-29, 1362-65)- The address to the swift Phoenician ship sailing across the seas (I451 if.) recalls the other Helen's journey to Troy (e.g., 229-38). The sea which has hitherto signified separation, wandering, and deathII2 now becomes the literal means of recovering all that was lost and of passing from death to life. At the end of the ode the chorus calls upon the Dioscuri to cross the grey sea and the dark swell of its waves, sending the favoring breezes which will carry the united couple home (i5oi-5). They are then to "cast off from their sister the ill-fame (dyskleia) of a barbarian couch" (i5o6-7). The crossing of the sea 'IO See Od. I9.

There may also be a play on the Hades-like quality of Egypt in 69, where Teucer compares the palace to " the house of Plutus," possibly alluding to the association Ploutos/Plouton: see Nilsson, Gesch.

The sea performs the same restorative function for Menelaus. It receives his arms (1262) and washes off the stains (Ai%v,ia-a, 1271) of the polluted past. Having robbed Menelaus of his heroic identity, as he says at his first appearance in the play (see 424-25), it now renders that identity back to him. In its restorative function the sea presents the appearance of " death," when in fact it confers new life. When Theoclymenus asks what kind of death Menelaus dies, Helen replies that he perished "most pitiably, in the sea's wet waves" (o KTpora6', vypotsrwv Ev KAv&amp;covtotS a'ioA, I209; see also I27I). The two positive functions of the sea, restoring identity and purifying the past, not only repeat the contrasts between appearance and reality and death and life, but also connect these contrasts with those between Troy and Egypt. Its healing and purificatory functions are the cosmic analogue to those of Theonoe (see 866-67) and stand at the opposite pole from Theoclymenus' narrow, limited purity (see I430-3 I). Even more important, the figure of Galaneia in the first strophe of the ode (1456-64) recalls Theonoe's mythical sea-ancestry: Proteus, the Nereids, Psamathe (see 4-15 and above, p. 588). Galaneia is herself "the grey daughter of Pontus" (I457) and like these other sea-deities is a beneficent figure."13 Theonoe's mythical marine ancestry, es- pecially in its connection with Proteus, has signified the possible exis- tence of justice, piety, and the higher "reality" of a purer moral order. This marine mythology and Proteus, as symbols of that order, accom- pany the images of a joyful, revivified nature, in contrast to the dying nature of the parode. This kindly "Egyptian" mythology, more remote and less familiar than the Olympian, also contrasts with the negative anthropomorphism of Olympus in the early part of the play (e.g., the myths of Callisto and Kos in 375-85). The reborn joy of nature, which is also the joy of Persephone's return from the under- world, is then carried to Sparta in the antistrophe which follows the I3 Some interesting views on the image of nature and the figure of Galaneia in this ode were presented at the sixty-fourth annual meeting of the Classical Association of New England in April, 1970 by Thomas C.

The temple of Athena, previously the setting for the Persephone-like abduction of Helen (243-48), now stands alongside the Spartan festival of the Hyacinthia. The marriage torches of Hermione which end the antistrophe (I476-78) have an important role in defining these antitheses. We spoke above (p. 598) of their role in signifying the private aspect of the protagonists' happy reunion. But Hermione too stands under the large archetype of the Maiden reclaimed. Her marriage torches mark a return to life and light, analogous to the entrance of Theonoe (865-72) and the renewed marriage of Helen and Menelaus (see 637-4I, 722-25). Like the Hyacinthia and the Spartan myths of the Leucippidae (1465- I468), Hermione's torches resolve in local and intimate terms the anti- thesis between life and death. They complete an antithesis between the treacherous fire-beacons of Nauplius at the remote Cephiridean reefs (766-67, II26-3 )II)4 and the flames which razed Troy on the one hand and the purifying torches of Theonoe on the other (865-72). Correspondingly, the destructive sea of the Nauplius story in the Trojan realm contrasts with the kindly sea of Galaneia (linked to Egypt's marine mythology) in this ode. VIII Indispensable as Theonoe is, it is Helen who effects the decisive move- ment from death to life. She activates the life-giving possibilities which stand on one side of the play's polarities and form one side of the Egyptian locale. Her distinctive quality in effecting this movement is summed up in the word Xdpts, which includes grace, charm, beauty, song, gratitude, loVe.II5 In its flexibility and range of meanings it is especially appropriate to the iridescent radiance of Helen herself Charis first occurs at the end of Teucer's speech on the oracle of the foundation of Salamis. Apollo has foretold that he will name his new land " Salamis" "for the sake of(as a sign of favor or gratitude toward) his homeland there" (r71S EKEF Xapi vaTpasg, I5o). This charis in the new settlement suggests a benign movement from the Trojan world to I4 Verrall IIO notes how odd it is for the chorus to know of this detail at 767.

The life-giving significance of charis, however, is primarily associated with Helen. In the first strophe of the parode she asks Persephone to receive her songs of lamentation accompanied by her tears as a thank offering to the dead (I73-78). The phrasing of lines I76-77 is especially suggestive: Xa p v'rag v` ErT pvt / aKrap EVECV . . . VEKVCFLV Ao'evots qac3. Although 7T" &amp;KpVcf is probably to be construed with AaP ('' take in accompaniment to my tears"), the juxtaposition of the phrase with xacpra brings together one of the main antitheses of the play: joy and weeping, the charis of song and art and the tears over the dead at Troy. We may compare the movement from lype' to terpsis in the ode on the Mountain Mother (see above, p. 595). Indeed, muclh of the meaning and beauty of the play lies in this phrase, Xaptrag ... o7aL &amp;LKpVcFL: the attainment ofjoy and beauty in the midst of the lamentations of death and war, a faith in life and creation which can envisage a higher reality of innocence and beauty through the deluded killings at Troy. Hence the related word xapva in 32I denotes the possibility that Menelaus is alive despite the "lamentations" (ycovs, 321) of his death. That same antithesis is stamped on the reunion between Menelaus and the real Helen: his tears (dakrya, cf 176) change to joy" (Xaptov&amp; 654), and there is more joy" (charis) than pain (lypai, 654-55). The association of charis with a movement from pain to joy receives its most vivid formulation in the Mountain Mother ode. The Charites sent by Zeus serve as the essential instruments of the rebirth and re- vivification of nature. These joyful and restorative songs which pro- voke the Goddess' laughter (I349) and pleasure (terpsis, I352) are in direct contrast with the parode. There Helen sang plaintive songs to the dead (I76) and called upon the Sirens, "daughters of Earth," to come with their mournful music (I68-73). These Sirens are not the spellbinding singers of the Odyssey, but chthonic deities connected with funeral monuments and the grave.II6 Their music is appropriate to this underworld, death-bound half of the Persephone cycle. But the II6 For these chthonic Sirens anid further literature see Kannicht ad loc.

Theog. 64-5), unlike Helen's tearful charites of I76, are joyful and life-giving as they celebrate Persephone's return and, by analogy, Helen's release from her death-like imprisonment at Proteus' tomb. Charis as the joy of rebirth continues into the next scene when Helen, as part of her manipulation of death and life, tells Theoclymenus that she would die with Menelaus out of love for him (I40I-2). But, she goes on, " What charis would there be in dying with the dead? " (I402- 3). And she then reiterates her need for a ship "that I may receive full charis" (I4II). In both of these lines charis denotes her abandon- ment of death for life. Behind this apparent abandonment of the " dead " Menelaus for a living husband lies her " real " abandonment of a death-like state for the "life" and marriage signified by the return to Sparta. Hence the "full charis" of 14II refers, at one level to the " favor" conferred on her by Theoclymenus, but at another level to the joy of life, rebirth, renewal contained in her escape with Menelaus. Charis also means "charm," and especially sexual charm, a quality which Helen, if any woman, possesses in the highest degree. The play shows her, in contrast to her eidolon at Troy, using this aspect of charis in the service of life. In the scene with Theonoe she draws upon the multiple meanings of charis-gratitude, charm, grace-to persuade one who has renounced the sexual charis to aid the cause of love. Euripides must have savored this paradoxical understanding between the figure of Helen and the virginal Theonoe. Helen is careful to adapt her charis to Theonoe's moral purity. She warns against the moral failing involved in winning her brother's "thanks" or "favor" for an unjust cause. Do not earn charites, she warns, that are evil and unjust (Xacptras ITOv7)pcLs Ka LKOVS, 902)."7 If the probable emendation of Reiske, SCWELS xapwv, can be accepted in 92I, she repeats this plea not to give charis to an unjust brother."18 Later she asks Theonoe to grant her this "favor" (charis, 940) and imitate the ways of her father. The result is that Theonoe does, in fact, refuse charis to her brother (iooo). 117 On the problem of 900-902 see Pohlenz 2.I60. 118 The emendation is accepted by Kannicht ad loc., who provides a full discussion and points out the weakness of the MS authority here. Dale is more hesitant, though she points out, as had Hermann before her (ad 937), the echo of 92I in iooo-iooi if the text is emended.</page><page sequence="51">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 603 To mark how conmpletely Helen's own charis, the spirit of charm and beauty, triumphs here Theonoe seals her promise with an invocation to Charis, the divinity of love and sexuality equivalent to Aphrodite (i006-7): rR XJpFs o 4Zo1 "'AEWgE FLP E" ?, CV/J43E'pCKE 8' o8acpov. It is true that Theonoe's prayer to the erotic Charis is appropriate in the light of her earlier warning of Aphrodite's opposition to the couple's return (884-86).' 9 Yet Euripides is also exploiting to the limits this paradoxical collusion between Helen and the devotee of purity and philosophy, a sort of kindly female Hippolytus. But there is more than dramatic cleverness. To have effected so unwonted a prayer in this austere priestess is also a signal victory for the life-giving charis which Helen embodies. It is with Theoclymenus that Helen most successfully deploys the full range of her charis. The credulous and somewhat loutish king is no match for this womanly grace, charm, and wit. Helen need only make a strategic reference to marriage (I23 I), profer reconciliation (I233), and Theoclymenus is ensnared. "Let there be charis in return for charis," he promises (I234): "favor for favor" is what he means, but his words also suggest, ironically, the deeper "joy" of Helen's return for her present show of "charmn'." The disguised Menelaus adds that the ship would itself be a sign of " favor " (or " gratitude ") for Menelaus: MEVE'AE4 -rE rrp3S XaPLtv (I273). Theoclymenus innocently pays tribute to Helen's "charm" when he promises to heap the ship with gifts, doing this, as he tells the disguised husband, "out of favor for her" (T 8E 1rpos' xa'ptv, I28I). In Helen's last appearance on stage charis occurs no fewer than seven times in some seventy lines. It describes her success in winning over Theonoe (I373), in deceiving Theoclymenus (I378, I397, I4II), in abandoning death for the joy of life (I402). Her last use of the word brings together its fullest range of associations. Theoclymenus is concerned that Helen may weep too much for her "dead" husband. She reassures him with the words, "This is the day that will reveal to 1T9 See Matthiesseni 695-96.</page><page sequence="52">604 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I you my charis" (-qWq' ruE'pa oot -r- V 4r)v OEtLEt Xaptv, I420). Theo- clymenus is probably to understand charis to mean "gratitude" here. But to the audience it also signifies that "charm,'" " "beauty" which are part of Helen's resilient hold on the vitality of existence and her capacity to bring forth life from death. "What charis is it to die with the dead," she had said a few lines before (I402-3). In his last lines on stage Menelaus prays to Zeus for "one favor" (tdav Xaptv, I449). Helen's life-giving charis has already secured it in advance. Ix The Helen not only points back to the sophistic dichotomies of onoma and pragma, but also looks ahead to the Platonic attempt to distinguish appearance from reality in a deeper sense. The young Plato, as a lad of sixteen, may well have been in the audience of the play's first performance. Euripides, like Plato, suggests that the ultimate reality may consist in a purity and beauty which we reach through the violence and con- fusion of the eidola which deceive us with their false goals. Theonoe is, as Kannicht suggests, a poetic anticipation of Plato's concern with freeing the mind from the obscurities of the sense-world in order to attain the purity and clarity of the noumenal realm.I2O Plato too used Stesichorus' myth of the phantom Helen as a parable of the evils we suffer when we are deceived by the "false" beauty and "false" pleasures of the sense-world (Rep. 9.586BC). In Euripides' play not only Theonoe, but also the true Helen-and perhaps, therefore, the true reality-are in touch with what is life-giving, innocent, and noble. So in Plato the ultimate reality is good, pure, and beautiful. It is our task not to mistake the mists of appearances for this reality, not to take the shadows in the cave for the true shapes of things in the light of the sun or confuse the murky depths in which most men live with the clear atmosphere which the philosopher breathes (Repub. 7.5 I4A i.; Phaedo I09A-IIC). Menelaus, in more than a literal way, comes to "see" the world differently. The violence of his ten-year effort to I20 Kannicht I.76, citing Phaedo 67A and Theat. I76A-c. See also the interesting remarks of Gregoire 43-46, who notes that aside from Aristophanes' parody in Thesm. the name Theonoe occurs only in Euripides and Plato (Cratyl. 407B).</page><page sequence="53">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 6o5 regain the shadow of the real Helen contrasts ironically with the com- parative ease with which the real Helen falls into his arins and devises the means for their reunion. So much similarity there is, perhaps. Yet Euripides is not Plato. Menelaus returns with the real Helen, but he is no philosopher. Euripides remains more interested in the twists and turns of men's delusions than in the grasping of an eternal and ideal reality. Hence, for all the antitheses between Helen's gentle arts and Mene- laus' violence, between Egypt and Troy, feminine and masculine values, the action culminates in a swashbuckling scene of violence in which the veteran of Troy is totally in his element. Menelaus invokes Poseidon next to the " pure daughters of Nereus " (I584-86) and pours "streams of blood" (at'la-ros d7roppoal) into the sea (I587-88). He thus pollutes with bloodshed those "maiden-lovely streams" of the play's first line, with its associations of Egypt's benign marine myth- ology. The action also recalls the "streams of blood" (a t'larosg 'oat, 984) with which, in his desperation, he threatened to defile Proteus' tomb (984-85). The destructive and divisive significance of the sea in the first half of the play now emerges as a possibility once more, even though life is winning out over death. When Menelaus creeps to the prow sword in hand "having no thought of any corpse" (VEKp6iV [E'V OV3EVOSr ,LV V E'Xuv, I583), the victory over death is assured; yet we are also reminded thereby of the ritual death through which he has had to pass. The ensuing battle is itself one of those "contests of blood" (atLtAAa ... at[La-rosr, II55-56) which the chorus condemned in the famous anti-war passage in the first stasimon (iI5I-58). Menelaus calls upon his companions to " bloody" (KaOaqua-rcoarEt) the heads of the Egyp- tians (I599). " Slaughter, massacre the barbarians," he shouts (ooa'iEtv, OOVEVEtV, I594). Indeed, the battle virtually transforms the ship into a "stream of blood" like those of 984 or I587-88: ovco SE vaiis' EppEtrO (I602). Menelaus addresses his men here as "the sackers of Troy" (i56o); and Helen calls upon the "Trojan glory" (I604). Throughout the play, however, Troy and the kleos of Troy's capture have had a primarily negative significance (see especially 808-54 and above, section V).12I 12I With i56o cf. 8o6; with I603 cf. 845.</page><page sequence="54">6o6 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I It may be, as some have argued, that we are not to take the death of the Egyptians too seriously.I22 The slaughter of the bull could even appear as a kind of ritual scapegoat for Helen's safe return. The burden of the dead past or the false, "destructive image" (73) must be "'sacrificed" to reacquire innocence. Yet a real human "sacrifice," barbarians though the victims are, follows the killing of the animal. Herodotus had included a grisly tale of human sacrifice in his account of Helen and Menelaus' escape from Egypt (2.II9.2-3); and Euripides may have that passage, with its grim overtones, in mind here. Sacri- fice in general is an ominous theme in the tale of Troy.'23 Euripides does not dwell on it in this play as he had in the Taurian Iphigeneia. Yet Helen spoke of her suicide as a "sacrifice" to the goddesses' jealousy (354-57), and Menelaus had alluded to the preliminary shed- ding of blood with enigmatic relish: TpoaUa'&amp;E-rLat AEv atpla lrpTra vEplTEpot9 (I255). On the positive side, the concluding battle reenacts history in a way which wipes out the old guilt. The Trojan war is fought again, in miniature. But Helen is now on the right side, cheering on her husband. Her verb avqpr7TaaE at I374 even recalls the "rape" which began the conflict (5o), but now it is her husband (7ronort, I374) who is doing the "carrying off." In allowing Helen to relive as a virtuous wife her sinful Trojan past, Euripides is also availing himself of the imaginative possibilities of romance where the dead past may be relived and second chances are the rule.124 I22 So Steiger 2I7; Grube 35o. Verrall remarks that the killing of the Egyptians "would be repulsive if it were not too silly" (54); see also 85: ". . . Any audience fit for Euripides would feel this to be a hideous thing, a thing intolerable, unless, in some extreme circumstances, it might perhaps be presented as a stern necessity." "Cold- blooded cruelty," he says on the next page (86). I23 Arrowsmith 39 suggests that the Brauron cult in the L T. serves "to lay bare the immense human 'blood-sacrifice' of the Peloponnesian war." See his further remarks on 44-45. The sacrificial animal is also handled in a way which makes an ostentatious display of physical force (cf. I56I-64). The rather mysterious horse of I567-68, which Dale finds "superfluous" and "an unwelcome anticlimax" (ad I563-68), may be there as a reminder of the martial character of Menelaus, the heroic identity being reborn: cf. the equine sacrifice in Il. 23.I7I and also Hdt. 4.7I-72, Tac. Germ. 27. On the rarity of horse sacrifices see L. Ziehen, RE i8.i (I939) 59i-92, s.v. "Opfer." At the same time the horse would be an appropriate sacrifice to Poseidon for one who seeks a safe return over the sea to his homeland: cf. Frazer ad Pausan. 8.7.2. I24 Hence the revival of the " dead" in the Winter's Tale, Pericles, Cymbeline. There is a good example of this imaginative cancellation of the burdensome past through</page><page sequence="55">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 607 It is also possible to regard the battle scene in psychological terms: it is a cathartic, liberating re-experience of a traumatic, guilt-laden past. Dramatically Helen's role in this scene is essential for the completion of her side of the story. As Menelaus recovers his identity as a heroic warrior, so Helen recovers hers as a virtuous wife. This dramatization of her recovery of identity is all the more important as the eidolon in the first part of the play has raised the question of that identity. Indeed, Helen feels the shame of the evils perpetrated in her name as a part of herself. As Kannicht observes, "Without the beautiful Helen, then, no eidolon of the beautiful Helen either: just this fateful conjunction is the basis of the tragic paradox which alienates her from herself: to be avadTLos 0' waTtva 7 cdvamLoS.'25 The battle-scene heals the split in her identity between onoma and pragma and is a final overcoming of her "Selbstentfremdung." There are, of course, other positive features of the ending too. The benign effect of Zeus' purposes stated in the prologue (see 36-37, 44-47) but obscured in the parode (24I-43) are now confirmed: " Such is the will of Zeus 9(ZE1i yap coE f3o5Ae-ra, i669).126 The appearance of the Dioscuri also confirms the immortal (I659), and not the mortal, logos of their fate (see 21, 138-42, 284-85) and establishes Helen's virtue forever (I666-70, I686-87). On the other hand their appear- ance is made absolutely necessary by the sanguinary fury of Theo- clymenus. And, in any case, Euripidean dexiotes could have devised a less violent resolution to a play in which the Trojan war and war in general have carried nothing but the most negative associations. A work which has bitterly condemned violence requires violence, finally, for its resolution. The chorus' words at ii i-58 are an ironic, haunting echo as Menelaus, seconded by Helen, pours blood into the sea and invokes the sack of Troy and the "Trojan glory" (i56o, I603). The point is not that we have to decide between a positive or nega- tive interpretation, but rather that Euripides himself refuses to decide. reliving it in the section entitled "Alle Madchen sind dein" in Hesse's Der Steppenwolf (Gesammelte Dichtungen, Suhrkampfed. [I952] 4.373 ff.) The descent to the underworld in Od. i i and Aen. 6 also provides some analogies. I25 Kannicht I.6I. I26 Matthiessen 695 notes the balancing of Theonoe's prayer to Aphrodite (I093-I06) by Menelaus' to Zeus near the end of the action (144I-50). See also Conacher 30I-2 who notes the absence of "Zeus' plans" from Theonoe's explanation (p. 302).</page><page sequence="56">6o8 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I There is ultimately no total reconciliation between the play's "two worlds." The vision of the Helen is profoundly dualistic, and the dualism may cut too deeply to be bridged. Parallel to this dualism in the dramatic structure stands the philo- sophical dualism connected with the aether and Theonoe, the contrast, broadly speaking, between spirit and matter. Professor Burnett's elucidation of this dualism is especially valuable, though the connection with Anaximander is perhaps not to be insisted on: 127 The materialist, Anaximandrian theory of justice was altered by Euripides not only because of its alienation from the world and its morality, but also because it belonged at last to a monistic system. Anaximander's justice lay in the undifferentiated Boundless from which the Opposites came, just as Anaxagoras' nous stood single and sufficient behind the created world. By contrast, the justice which Theonoe serves is the phenomenon of a dualistic universe. In her own person Theonoe unites justice with aither, for she, who has an altar of Dike within herself, is also the priestess of the divine aither .. . But aither, the house of Zeus (Nauck2, Frag. 49I), or Zeus himself (Nauck2, Frags. 836, 869, 903, 935, and many others), was not for Euripides the single first substance. Creation oc- curred only when aither was paired with earth (Nauck2, Frags. 836, IOI2). Reflecting this duality, the Helen recognizes a double system of causation and of morality, influenced perhaps by the Opposites of Anaximander, and looking forward to the coexistence of the Wandering Cause and the Mind, in the Timaeus. Thus here at the end Helen's purity, innocence, resilience prove to be not enough. Violence is needed, and the male heroism of Menelaus supplies it. The "streams of blood" which he pours forth (I 587) are not only a dark counterstatement to the virginal purity of Egypt's streams (line i), but also a return to primitive ritual after philosophical mysticism and lofty spirituality. The antithesis between the primitive- archetypal and philosophical-speculative aspects of the play noted earlier is not resolved any more than that between the reality of war and the aspiration toward peace (iisi-58). Egypt itself is dualistic: beside Theonoe there stands Theoclymenus, as beside Helen Menelaus. The play contains bold speculations on spiritual immortality (1013-I6); yet Helen and Menelaus' rebirth requires a deeply primitive sacrifice of blood. 127 Burnett i 6 I.</page><page sequence="57">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 609 The ending, therefore, gives an ironic turn to the antithesis of reality and appearance in the play and deepens the pervasive dualism with a profounder dualism which reflects basic cleavages in human life: philosophical principles and primitive rituals, abstract thought and vegetation myths, spiritual purity and fertility celebrations, immortal aether and the shedding of blood.I28 The antithetical structure of the play subsumes these final antitheses into those between Troy and Egypt, guilt and innocence, death and life. The mythic "language" of the plot and the intellectualist language of the philosophical prob- lems enrich and expand one another with ever-widening horizons. The fact that the dualism emerges at the end as a necessary part of our world-structure, however, suddenly throws the clarity of those previous antitheses into confusion. The play's final irony in this supposedly "happy ending" is that the previous antitheses are shown to be sim- plistic. In the last analysis human life cannot be reduced to clear-cut dichotomies. "Reality" is elusive and ambiguous precisely because it is itself a perpetual dialectic between what "seems" and what "is." For this reason Helen, with her ambiguous status between corporeal and fictive being, is the central figure, and Theonoe and Menelaus remain simpler polarities at either end of the spectrum. We may emerge from the mists long enough to recognize the clarity and beauty of a Theonoe; but, when we return to the realm of action, to " real" Sparta after fairyland Egypt, we find ourselves again in a dualistic world where the boundaries between reality and appearance are not sure, where a Helen needs a Menelaus and joins him in the war-cry and the lust for blood. Once out of range of that suspended world of Theonoe's mysterious wisdom and Proteus' mild justice and s"phrosyne", we return to the strife, passions, possessiveness of men and the inevi- table bloodshed to which they lead. The reenacted Trojan war at the end darkens the validity of a Theonoe's claims to superior truth and the " reality" of her philosophical realm after all. Ending with battle and war enables Euripides to keep a certain bitterness of mood. In adapting Euripides' myth to his Agyptische Helena, Hofmannsthal felt that the motif of the eidolon introduced the problem of dividing the work into two parts, a ghost-story and an 128 See Burnett I55.</page><page sequence="58">6io CHARLES SEGAL [I97I idyll.I29 One may demur at considering Euripides' Helen a ghost story (Hofmannsthal, like Goethe, exploited this facet of the legend), but it is clear that his ending is carefully planned to keep the " idyll" far in the background. As in The Tempest, the return to mainland reality brings a relinquishment of the infinite openness and hopefulness of romance. Euripides' ending, like Prospero's last action, figuratively buries the creator's book of spells and abjures the " rough magic " of his " so potent art." I30 x There is still another dimension of meaning in the two worlds of the Helen. Helen is a ministrant to life and renewal in both a physical and spiritual sense. Her charis is the joy of life and feminine charm. But it also includes the beauty of art. Her role as a manipulator of techne and mechane, of deception and the double vision which confuses the more prosaic every-day mentalities of Menelaus and Theoclymenus, also signifies the restorative force of art itself. Like the poet, Helen rings the changes on illusion and reality and with falsehood achieves truth. Gorgias used the figure of Helen to reflect upon the nature of art,'3' and the Gorgianic elements in the antitheses of Euripides' have long been recognized.I32 Plutarch reports a remark of Gorgias, "a propos of tragedy, as follows (FVS6 82B23): "The one who deceives is more just than the one who does not deceive, and the one who is deceived is wiser than the one not deceived." Plutarch's context makes it clear that Gorgias is talking about the need for successful fiction (" deception") in representational art, which conveys its truth by exploiting the audience's acceptance of the "'appearances " which it in fact knows to be a "'lie." Something of this idea, I suggest, underlies certain elements in Euripides' play, especially the fanciful Egyptian setting and the marine mythology of Psamnathe, the Nereids, Proteus, Galaneia, and even Theonoe. Given the problematical character of reality itself, Euripides is saying, there I29 The quotation from Hofmannsthal is given by Alt 24, note I. 130 The Tempest, 5.1.49-5I. 131 See my essay, "Gorgias and the Psychology of theLogos," HSCP66 (i962) 99-I55. 132 Solmsen, "Onomna"; see also Schmid 504, with note 3.</page><page sequence="59">Vol. I02] THE TWO WORLDS OF EURIPIDES HELEN 6ii may be a truth which goes deeper than our every-day vision of things, a truth which looks improbable and "deceptive," but yet is "wise" and "just" in Gorgias' sense. This is the visionary truth of art, imagina- tion, and mysticism. By its light the apparent triumphs even of the physical prowess of a Menelaus may prove eidola. Theonoe's Egypt, akin to Gorgias' "wiser" deception, may harbor truths about our existence that are usually concealed from us, clouded by our passions and the impurities of our lives and our world. As the kaleidoscope of the play's antitheses between appearance and reality turns before our eyes, we become aware that the play qua play is itself a term in those antitheses: the very fact that we watch with rapt attention a wildly improbable tale of fantastic characters indicates something of our own hesitation between illusion and reality. What Northrop Frye has said of The Tempest is in part applicable also to the Helen: "The play is an illusion like the dream, and yet a focus of reality more intense than life affords . . . What seems at first illusory, the magic and music, becomes real, and the Realpolitik of Antonio and Sebastian becomes illusion'. I33 That Euripides was conscious of such possibilities appears substantiated by at least one passage in which he deliberately breaks through the dramatic illusion and reminds us that we are, after all, watching a play, a fiction (see Ios6).I34 This tension between art and reality, like the more general tension between appearance and truth, also remains unresolved. Helen's mental me&amp;chanai and "wise deceptions" yield place at the end to the hard truth of Menelaus' brawn. Unlike Plato, Euripides has no con- viction of an ideal truth. He is content to reveal how problematical is the relation of all human life to what we suppose to be real or illusory. Unique as the Helen is, it also shares in what Zuntz has called "the tragic essence of Euripides' works, namely, the renunciation of a final truth [which] serves, in the Helena, to irradiate, ironically, the web of inescapable error and limited yet saving understanding which is life."

Theonoe remains in the sealed off realm of Egypt; and the threat of violence to her person, parallel with Helen's participation in the reenacted Trojan war, is a final compounding of the ambiguity of art and illusion. Euripides has taken us to magic realms and " faery lands forlorn," but he has also shown us their fragility. And that double vision of art's use of illusion to convey truth, its suspension between onoma and pragnia, cloud-image and solid body, belongs to the special quality of self-reflective romance which the Helen shares with The Temnpest: These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into air, into thin air; And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. CONCLUSION The complexity of the two worlds of the Helen takes us back to the inevitable question of whether the play is a tragedy, a comedy, or something in between. Unquestionably there is much in the Helen that is comic, or at least amusing. Yet even the most "comic" scenes -Menelaus and the Portress or the appearance of Theoclymenus- have their serious side. While the motifs of agnoia and anagnorisis point ahead to New Comedy, they have their fully tragic aspect too: the ignorance and blindness in which so much of human life is lived.I36 Indeed, the confusions and recognitions of New Comedy arose and were (are) appreciated not just because of the titillation of the unex- pected, but because they too point to the uncertainty, ignorance, and instability of the human condition.I37 136 See Solmsen, "Ion," 434 and 452-3.

Euripides, like many artists in the late stages of their work, has created a form which transcends the precise limits between genres. Shakespeare's late "tragic" romances-notably Cymbeline and Pericles-are a close analogy. The urge and the en- couragement to go beyond the conventional form of tragedy must have come with the conception of the basic material of the plot: the complex interchanges of appearance and reality, the exotic setting, the philosophical mysticism, the ritual death and rebirth, the odes on Persephone and the Mountain Mother, the blend of sophistic episte- mology and ancient, Odyssean archetypes. The equally "romantic" and "Ccomic" features of plays like the Iphigeneia among the Taurians and the Ion-to say nothing of the heroless Trojan Women or the tripartite Heracles Mad-suffice to show that Euripides was in a period of intense artistic exploration and experimentation. The Helen's very hesitation between tragedy and comedy is itself one term in the questions and antitheses which it poses: are truth and " reality" something akin to the gentleness, beauty, innocence of Helen or to the mystical purity of Theonoe, or are they rather akin to the "Trojan" violence of Menelaus (and Theoclymenus), for it is the action of these two male characters that stands out most vividly at the end of the play. If a choice must be made, one can find legitimate grounds for con- sidering the Helen a tragedy, albeit a tragedy of a very special form. It depicts, finally, not an escape into a transformed world, as Aristophanic comedy often does, or even the renewal of a disrupted social order, after the fashion of Menander and his successors, but raises disturbing and ironic questions about the place of violence and bloodshed in the " reality" in which men have to live. The necessity of reenacting the Trojan war, cathartic though that may be, and the brutal impulses of Theoclymenus toward the miasma of shedding kindred blood in the penultimate scene shatter the simplicity of a "happy ending." The Helen is "tragic" if only because it recalls us to the horror of our immersion in a deluded world of passion, war, razed cities, empty goals. It makes us aware, on a multiplicity of levels, of the cost of choosing appearance over reality-a choice for which the play's purest and most idealistic character comes close to paying withl her life.</page><page sequence="62">6I4 CHARLES SEGAL [I97I Zuntz has beautifully described the play as "an ethereal dance above the abyss."
