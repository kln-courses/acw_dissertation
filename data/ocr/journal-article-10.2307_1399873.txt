<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAN CLASSICISTS WRITING IN DIALOGUE ABOUT THEIR OWN TRADITION Michael Nylan Introductory Remarks Despite the scathing criticisms leveled at Han philosophy by ortho- dox Neo-Confucians and their latter-day scholastic followers, the most accurate characterization of many extant pieces of Han philosophical writing would be "critical" (rather than "superstitious") and "probing" (rather than "derivative").' In defense of this statement, this essay exam- ines three major Han philosophical works, with particular emphasis on their treatment of the classical tradition and classical learning. The three works are: the Fa yen (ca. A.D. 9) by Yang Hsiung, the Lun heng (ca. A.D. 80) by Wang Ch'ung, and the Feng su t'ung yi (ca. A.D. 200) by Ying Shao. All three works are profoundly critical of beliefs and practices en- demic to mainstream, state-sponsored Confucianism in the Han.2 All three catalog the many failings of contemporary Ju, whose training as "classical scholars" had won them wealth, rank, and fame, but little un- derstanding of the Ju enterprise.3 At the same time, all three authors identify themselves as men working hard to recapture and restore the essential, "true" classical (Ju) tradition.4 I will argue that it is no co- incidence that all three works employ the dialogue form to communicate their ideas. The dialogues of Yang Hsiung, Wang Ch'ung, and Ying Shao certainly challenge articles of faith cherished by members of the classically trained elite, with regard to both general principles and specific "proofs." All three of the thinkers under review here, for instance, dispute many "vulgar" beliefs, including the beliefs (a) that humans can achieve im- mortality by virtue, by dietary regimens, or by exercise; (b) that unseen "spiritual forces" (e.g., the dead and the gods) rule the course of human events; (c) that the past was qualitatively different from the present; and (d) that sage-kings arise every five hundred years, on a preordained schedule, according to a theory propounded by Mencius.5 Two of our three thinkers identified themselves as latter-day Yang Chus weeping at the forked path and Mo Tis lamenting dyed silk.6 In this language, they expressed their solidarity with past figures who lamented the propensity of gullible contemporaries to accept the most preposterous lies as bases for formulating ethical visions. (The third, Yang Hsiung, more selective in his choice of models, identified himself instead as a latter-day Mencius, grieving over the misdirection of Yang Chu and Mo Ti.) With considerable relish all three thinkers exposed the kind of fun- damental errors that lay behind the marvelous stories told about "one- footed K'uei," about the man found in Mr. Ting's well, and about the Associate Professor of East Asian Studies at Bryn Mawr College Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 47, Number 2 April 1997 133-188 ? 1997 by University of Hawai'i Press 133</page><page sequence="2">Prince of Huai-nan's supposed success in alchemical experiments.7 That a vigorous critical tradition inherited from the Warring States continued to exist in Han times is suggested less, then, by the high esteem generally accorded HsUin tzu in the Han than by the decision our three authors made to aim their iconoclastic remarks against the same targets and in much the same language employed by their philosophical prede- cessors.8 Add to this their inclination to test current theory by ob- servation from nature9 and the conclusion is inescapable: the best of the Han philosophical writers sought to discredit many persistent beliefs as- sociated with "vulgar" traditions, which were as popular among the Ju elite as among the unlettered,10 and they did so in language that self- consciously positioned themselves within an ongoing critical tradition, turning disputation (much maligned by many Ju) to respectable Ju uses.11 Critical these three major Han thinkers may be, but the foregoing comments about the self-referential nature of their critical remarks may more easily be used to support, rather than to discredit, the contention that even the best Han thinkers were unduly derivative. Didn't Han thinkers merely copy the major thinkers of the pre-Ch'in period in their ideas? For two important reasons, it would be wrong to see the major Han philosophers merely as second-rate imitators of the Warring States thinkers. First, the major Han philosophers set themselves the task of fully integrating the very latest philosophical and scientific concepts (espe- cially Five Phases correlative thinking) with older traditions defining the social virtues, believing that the moral universe had to reflect the laws of nature (especially as no supernatural deity intervened), and that a bril- liant new synthesis would produce an ideology behind which the em- peror and officials could unite. Second (and more importantly), philosophy from the mid-Western Han confronts a brand-new-and extremely disturbing-question hith- erto unasked: how could the state sponsorship of Confucian learning, which began in the mid-Western Han, have failed to bring the empire one whit closer to realizing the anticipated "Great Peace" (t'ai-p'ing), so that injustices and anomalies continued to occur under a nominally "just" dynastic rule?12 In conjunction, these new goals and new ques- tions forced Han thinkers to inquire more deeply and rather differently into the presumed relations between the cosmic, moral, and socio- political orders. Neither "derivative" nor "repetitive," Han philosophical writers of- fered a very wide range of answers to the single most pressing question of their day: "Where and how did Confucianism or Confucians go as- tray?" This essay will focus on the three divergent answers proposed by Yang Hsiung, Wang Ch'ung, and Ying Shao, but since each of these philosophers chose to present his ideas in a dialogue, a short digression on the popularity of the dialogue form in Han philosophy is in order. Philosophy East &amp; West 134</page><page sequence="3">In reading the extant pre-Ch'in philosophical works, it is often the discursive essay whose force and originality wins our praise. This is true also for the early Western Han, as with Lu Chia's Hsin yi, Chia Yi's Hsin shu, and the genuine chapters from Tung Chung-shu's Ch'un Ch'iu fan lu.13 The discursive essay, of course, recalls the set memorial framed by counselors asked to advise powerful rulers on matters of state.14 Yet the dialogue is the genre favored by many great Han thinkers (if the few ex- tant works convey any rough indication of more general trends in phi- losophy). Why is this so, when the essay format at first glance appears both more persuasive and more sophisticated? Is dialogue only to be expected whenever the state canonizes certain texts, as the state soon requires precise codification, clarification, and exposition of those same canonical texts? And does the very existence of so many dialogues in the Han demonstrate, as is commonly supposed, a decline in the quality of Han thought traceable to the widespread acceptance among Han Ju of a stultifying ideological straitjacket imposed by lengthy catechisms? In considering the use of the dialogue, I put forward eight prelimi- nary observations (all but two admittedly speculative). First, many Han thinkers may have assumed that the form employed in the Confucian Analects, a text whose interpretation is predicated on the existence of question-and-answer sessions between Master and disciple, provides the best model for any discussions devoted to the ethical issues associated with classical learning. The choice of dialogue, then, might imply at once an author's conscious commitment to sustain the original vision pro- moted by Confucius and a more general acceptance of the notion that intellectual interchange between two or more individuals committed to the Way is a redemptory act. Second, I suspect that many of the finest Han writers decided upon the dialogue form because it allowed the reader the edifying shock (either delicious or humiliating) that comes from an apparent reconsideration of first principles, placing Han Ju, as it were, back again in the schoolboy's seat. (Probably some passages in these dialogues originated in actual "school texts," to which masters added their comments.) Given the Han philosophical masters' belief that Confucianism and Confucians had at some point abandoned the true Way, a reconsideration of first principles was absolutely necessary. Third, it was the belief (or possibly the conceit?) of some skilled de- baters that the dialogue, which is inherently adversarial in nature, offered the single best chance for eliciting the approximate truth from seemingly irreconcilable versions; just as the stronger blade can be found through a "clash of blades," the more likely version can be inferred after a clash of ideas.15 Fourth, the true dialogue (as opposed to the catechism) is a form particularly well suited not only to the reconsideration of first principles and a determined search for truth, but also to a tenacious defense of Michael Nylan 135</page><page sequence="4">dogma, in that the deceptively simple question-and-answer format, with its semblance of cool objectivity and the "weighing of discourses," di- rects the reader's attention to only those issues that the writer wishes to focus upon.16 Fifth, the form of the dialogue lends itself to the construc- tion of holistic theories, as the act of proceeding through the dialogue is itself the process of overcoming duality.. Sixth, unlike the discursive rhetorical essay, the dialogue need not seek to prove a single proposition; it can tolerate greater ambiguity. Thus, the dialogue is free to suggest complex relations between certain phe- nomena (as much by proximity or parallelism in the dialogue as by di- dactic exposition). This was especially important when authors came to propose hypotheses that were not amenable to logical proof or that di- rectly contravened ordinary experience as interpreted by the conven- tional wisdom. Seventh, in all cases, the dialogue form has the potential to pack far more rhetorical punch than the average rhetorical essay; as in a pitched battle, the number and depth of rhetorical thrusts typically es- calate before the close, heightening the drama.17 Finally, the successful encapsulation of so many different points of view and personalities in the more complex dialogues requires spectac- ular virtuosity on the part of its author; this showiness, however gratifying to the author, seems permissible in an instructive dialogue, when a sim- ilar virtuosity in another genre (e.g., in the rhapsodic poem) might pro- voke censure from straitlaced readers on the lookout for frippery. I argue here that all eight reasons may have had a part in the decisions by Yang Hsiung, Wang Ch'ung, and Ying Shao to employ the dialogue rather than the expository essay; also, that the particular styles of dialogue chosen by Yang, Wang, and Ying directly relate to the specific content of their varying critiques of contemporary forms of Confucian theorizing and practice. Ying Shao, in several chapters of the Feng su t'ung yi, composes a mock dialogue, one in which classical Confucian prescriptions and contemporary Ju practice, rather than two representative individuals, are juxtaposed through a series of anecdotes so as to illustrate Ying's main philosophical point: that members of the contemporary office-holding elite, despite their long training in classical texts and professed adher- ence to Confucian values, have failed to exemplify Confucian standards because of their regrettable (and highly unorthodox) delight in excess and display; hence, the failure of Han Confucians to establish the an- ticipated "Great Peace." A century earlier than Ying, Wang Ch'ung's Lun heng used the ordinary dialogue form to different effect and for different ends: Wang believed that the Ju tradition had been contaminated by successive gen- erations of classical scholars who preferred an uncritical "love of the ancient" to using their rational minds. The Han empire would not ad- Philosophy East &amp; West 136</page><page sequence="5">vance, then, until men such as himself had cleansed classical tradition of its many factual errors. Wang favored the dialogue form as an effective weapon for refuting the various theories propounded by Wang's many real and hypothetical opponents. But Wang Ch'ung's somewhat idio- syncratic analysis of Confucianism's failures, coupled with his prickly personality, led him to indulge all too frequently in the game of "gym- nastic rhetoric," a game which mistakes the piling up of numerous minor objections to an opponent's view with more devastating thrusts at convention.18 A century prior to Wang Ch'ung, Yang Hsiung, in his Fa yen, offered still another solution to the Confucian crisis. According to Yang, the state sponsorship of Confucianism not only could not improve the quality of Ju commitment, but threatened to destroy it, for it implicitly denied an important truth: that the true commitment to classical learning is born of subtle "intuitions" about the sages' conduct that give rise to a developed "taste" for the Master's vision akin to that of the connoisseur. To argue this inherently unprovable proposition, Yang Hsiung, in his Fa yen, em- ploys a "dialectical montage,"19 which juxtaposes successive images that require the reader to discover their inherent relations; in this, Yang's style is somewhat reminiscent of Plato, for Yang's dialogues, like his rhapsodic poems, open questions, rather than answer them, while sug- gesting webs of relations threading through the cosmic, sociopolitical, and individual realms. (In reviewing the philosophical masterworks of Yang Hsiung, Wang Ch'ung, and Ying Shao, this essay will consider the three works in reverse chronological order, as the reverse order roughly reflects the degree of relative complexity and sophistication that each thinker brings to the dialogue form.) Descriptions of the Three Dialogues Ying Shao. In key chapters of the extant Feng su t'ung yi, Ying Shao uses a variation on the dialogue form to assess elite practices in the Han. Significantly, Ying chooses to employ the mock dialogue form in only a few of the extant chapters of the FSTY (chaps. 2-5), each of which dram- atizes the tremendous disparity between the canonical prescriptions found in the Confucian Classics and the current practices of self-identified Han Confucians, whose right to rank and reputation rests chiefly upon their presumed ability to exemplify brilliantly those same canonical pre- scriptions.20 (Note that the other extant chapters simply record Ying's opinions on successive topics, though Ying typically bolsters those opin- ions with citations from the Classics.) Ying Shao's implied "dialogue" is set up in the following manner: each entry begins with Ying summarizing the prevailing wisdom among the Han elite with regard to one or more prominent individuals who are thought worthy of emulation (e.g., Chih Yiin, Governor of Ju-nan, and Michael Nylan 137</page><page sequence="6">Ch'en Tzu-wei, Governor of Chiu-chiang). Sometimes the summaries begin with the formulaic phrases su shuo ("It is commonly said ... ") or su yen ("The common account is ... ",).21 After a concise summary of the prevailing wisdom, Ying Shao registers his own objections to the popular view22 in a section pieced together from multiple citations of the can- onical texts (most often the Confucian Classics). Sagely practice and mundane practice are pitted one against the other, then, as the canonical sources and the prevailing wisdom appear to face off in a verbal contest, although Ying consistently skews the discussion to favor his construction of classical norms rather than contemporary ones. With each of the four FSTY chapters consisting of around ten such contests, the FSTY aims to portray the larger patterns of moral benighted- ness in late Han times, especially the tendencies to confuse high status with singular virtue, to indulge in gross conformism and sycophantism, and to display excessive, attention-getting behavior. What is most striking about the material presented in these four chapters is Ying's quite careful attribution of the contemporary moral muddle to members of the Ju elite, all of whom have trained for long years in the very classical texts that Ying now uses to unmask their flagrant violations of basic ethical standards.23 In a sample entry, taken from chapter 3 of the Feng su t'ung yi, titled "Errors in Ritual," Ying tells the following tale: Hsueh Kung-tsu of Ju-nan, Governor of Shan-yang, did not shed a single tear in mourning his wife. As they were preparing the body for the grave, he shouted over the coffin: "We shared more than forty good years together; the clothes, the food, the salary, the gifts. Our sons and daughters have grown up. Fortunately, you did not die before your time, so how could I regret your return [to your forebears]? Now you have gone over to them."24 I venture to suggest: According to the Rites, a man carries the mourning staff for his wife,25 [showing that] he values her more than members of his paternal clan. [According to the canonical texts,] the very word for "wife" (ch'i) implies that she is equal (ch'i) to himself.26 [In an exemplary fashion,] it is she who clarifies the wine to nourish her parents-in-law. By "eternal contract," [as the Odes states], she presents cooked food27 while supervising the silkworm- raising and the weaving. It is she who "passes down the rule" to succeeding generations, [as it says in the Rites].28 It is certainly she whose loving care is true, whose diligence is extreme.29 Moreover, [as it says in the Record of Rites], even the lowly orders of birds and beasts still have thoughts of winging home [to a dead mate], as they utter plaintive cries. How can one "fear death and ruin's"30 eternal separation, yet still be without a pained expression? Should a man facing utter collapse on the inside force himself to appear self- controlled on the outside? This would be pretense, the worst kind of false- hood. The proverb goes: "When the wife dies, the gut sorrows / But only the self knows it." And another says, "The rites have nothing to do with a wife."31 What kind of rites are these? Surely [such sayings] are utterly perverse!.. Philosophy East &amp; West 138</page><page sequence="7">In Ying Shao's entry, the struggle between conventional wisdom and true understanding takes shape against memorable scenes and stunning allegations. Ying, a noted juridical expert, evidently felt that the standard format for legal plaints, a list of charges followed by citations of the rel- evant parts of the legal code, could be adapted easily enough to recreate much of the crackling tension of a courtroom drama.32 Read in succes- sion, these entries, alternating examples of bad conduct with good, form a kind of mock dialogue cleverly fashioned to shake Ying's contem- poraries out of their present complacency, so that they might be led to hear Ying's main protest: a goodly proportion of the elite Ju seem unable to fit their conduct to Confucian norms, although the Ju elite's very place in society is predicated on their supposed ability to represent classical ideals in current practice. At the same time, the dialogues' skillful assemblage of so many countervailing voices from the wider public (past and present, living and dead, author and reader, canonical authority and befuddled sap) serves well to underscore psychologically Ying Shao's impassioned view of history, as presented in the Feng su t'ung yi's preface: that the early confusion within the inner circle of Confucian disciples, which fractured the original holistic vision of the sacred Sage-Master, Confucius, has grown worse by successive stages over time, first with the open contests between the pre-Han philosophers, and then with the continual pro- liferation of scholastic lines resulting from the state sponsorship of Con- fucian learning.33 Sadly, this artful quality of Ying's mock dialogues is apt to be lost on the modern reader, who must wade gamely through a text mined with allusions to the ethical and political equations that were once routinely drawn between late Han and early Western Chou institutions, equations that formed the theoretical basis for both Han classical learning and Han court practices.34 In any case, insofar as Ying's consistent promotion of certain canonical values associated with early Chou feudalism is in- tended to pave the way for a second mid-dynastic restoration under the Liu clan, the reader will find that Ying's critique of contemporary prac- tices seldom strays far from the didactic catechism. For the moral edifi- cation of his readers, Ying has compiled a number of related cases de- signed to show that a wholesale cleansing of the elite ranks, followed by the promotion of proper behavioral models drawn directly from the Confucian canon, will allow the Han throne to find workable solutions to chronic flaws in its political and social institutions. Ying's inherent op- timism about the future of the Han is surely attributable to his own posi- tion of influence at court. As chief spokesperson for Shao, the chief power broker at the end of the Han, Yian Ying was, naturally enough, dis- inclined to advocate solutions that went beyond restoration and reform; he had stock in some parts of the status quo, even as he criticized it.3s Michael Nylan 139</page><page sequence="8">Wang Ch'ung. In contrast to Ying Shao, Wang Ch'ung employs the "classic" dialogue form (where real or imaginary opponents converse with the author) in all the Lun heng chapters, even in his "Autobiog- raphy." There Wang claims to offer a coherent account of the world (especially with regard to fate, defined as the patterned operations of ch'i) to replace the hodgepodge of "vulgar" traditions upheld by Wang's fellow students of classical learning, whose uncritical love of anything ancient precludes their reliance on rigorous reasoning.36 Wang Ch'ung is certain that once he has established "facts" and exposed pernicious "falsehoods," the Han dynasty will outshine all its glorious prede- cessors.37 If Wang is to accomplish this self-appointed task, a certain kind of dialogue provides the perfect tool by which Wang can distin- guish fact from error, edging closer to unitary Truth, for it allows Wang to highlight all the internal inconsistencies and improbabilities in the theories promoted by Wang's opponents, while glossing over possible objections to Wang's own hypotheses. A short excerpt shows Wang Ch'ung at his very best in expos- ing his contemporaries' errors. In a chapter titled "Exaggerations of the Classical Scholars" ("Ju tseng"), Wang Ch'ung brilliantly demolishes the tradition that the Nine Tripods of Chou were divine symbols of political legitimacy. Now what will we use to examine that theory about the divine powers of the Chou tripods? The metal used in the Chou tripods was tribute from the distant quarters. YU got [the metal] and had it cast into tripods. The tripods had [cast on them] images of the hundred beasts. Were [the tripods] divine because they were tribute from abroad? Then all things foreign are divine! Were they divine because Yu had them cast? But YO as a sage could not be a god! And if the person of a sage cannot be divine, how can cast vessels be divine? Or were the tripods divine because they were made of metal? By rule, metal is in the same category as stone. As stone cannot be divine, how can metal be divine? Or were [the tripods] divine because they had [cast on them] the images of a hundred beasts? Such images ... would be similar to [those found] on the Thunder Goblet [a sacred vessel of the Hsia dynasty], which had carved on it the shapes of clouds and thunder. Clouds and thunder are in the heavens; divinity is imbued in the hundred things. If images of clouds and thunder cannot be considered divine, then how can the images of the hundred things be considered divine?38 In one brief paragraph, Wang Ch'ung has managed to show that no single factor (the origin, the manufacturing process, the artistic motifs, or the ownership) qualifies the tripods for inclusion in the category of legit- imating instruments of divine efficacy. Having found no divinity in the constituent parts of the tripods, Wang Ch'ung leaves it to the reader to infer that no divinity rests in the tripods as a whole. I suggest that Wang Ch'ung plays best, however, when (a) we, the modern readers, share his Philosophy East &amp; West 140</page><page sequence="9">beliefs and presuppositions; and (b) Wang's skepticism has been applied to an appropriate topic securely located in the realm of facts. Wang Ch'ung is far less entertaining and enlightening when he en- gages, as he is wont to do, in factual nitpicking. Here is a good example of the kind of passage that occurs many times in Wang's reviews of his own classical tradition: The classical texts claim that Yang Yu-chi of Ch'u was a skilled archer who could hit a willow leaf a hundred times consecutively. This [claim] praises [Yang's] skill in archery. A statement that Yang in his time occasionally shot and hit a single willow leaf-that is credible. To talk of a hundred hits after a hundred shots-that is certainly to exaggerate it. Now let us suppose a person were to shoot at and hit a single willow leaf. After one or two shots, surely the leaf would be ripped apart, so that it could never be used as a target again. Then let us suppose that Yang had gone to shoot at leaves hanging down from a tree. Even if Yang had no desire to hit [other] leaves, given the thickness of the willow leaves [growing on the trees], he would naturally have hit them. In that case, [since the target would have been too easy for him,] Yang would surely have had someone scale [the tree] to pick the willow leaves [to make into targets on the ground]. One by one the leaves would be placed on the ground, where he would shoot them. To shoot at them 20 or 30 times would be enough to display his skill.... Surely it is perfectly obvious that it would not have been necessary for Yang to go on [repeating the act] a hundred times. Those who talk of the affair [simply] like to exaggerate the excellence of [Yang's] skill.39 Piling up objection after objection seems less helpful, as we see, when Wang turns to attacking literary turns of phrase. In Chinese, "a hundred times" is simply a conventional way of saying "many times." Why would Wang query the precise phrasing used in old legends when his topic is the broad outline of the story? Many Lun heng passages re- veal a similar distrust for figures of speech that devolves into a rather pedantic obsession with absolute linguistic precision. Here is another example: The Documents says, "Harmony was established among the 10,000 states."40 This [statement] praises Yao's charismatic virtue, which occasioned the moral transformation [known as] the Great Peace, a transformation that extended throughout the Chinese world, even unto the Yi and Ti barbarians. Had [the sentence] said, "Harmony prevailed beyond the Chinese territory," that would have been credible. But to speak of "10,000 states"-that is to exag- gerate it. Now under [the sage-king] T'ang-Yao and [the dynasty of] Chou, the entire domain was no more than 5,000 li in area. At the time of Chou, the feudal states numbered 1,793. If we add in the barren dominion, the Jung dominion, and the guarded dominion [three outlying regions], along with the people beyond the Four Seas who do not live on cooked rice (such as the tribes with Michael Nylan 141</page><page sequence="10">pierced-through breasts, with hanging ears, the pygmy tribes, and those who walk on tiptoe), the number [still] cannot be as much as 3,000. What Heaven covers and earth supports is certainly, then, no more than 3,000 [states]. But the Documents [wrongly] talks of the "10,000 states," exaggerating its praise, exceeding the truth, merely to express its admiration for Yao.41 In such diatribes against classical learning, Wang Ch'ung objects to a wide variety of metaphors and stock phrases drawn from the Confucian Classics, denouncing them as misleading exaggerations, if not outright lies.42 Apparently for Wang, these flaws, presumably multiplied through- out the text of the Confucian Classics, make the Classics unreliable authorities. For instance, Wang presents a lengthy list of arguments in- tended to cast doubt on the integrity of the entire Odes text, but, oddly enough, each point in Wang's extended tirade refers to a single line from an Odes poem, a line claiming that the call of a crane (a metaphor for the superior man in misfortune) was heard by Heaven. Basically, Wang argues that the distance between the crane and Heaven (the heavens) is too great to allow the crane's call to have been heard on High. Here, at least, Wang's overblown rhetoric contributes to a legitimate objective of the Lun heng: to disprove the crudest, most anthropocentric versions of the Mutual Sympathy between Heaven and Man (T'ien-jen kan-ying) theory touted by eminent court theorists.43 In assailing the metaphor, Wang repudiates those who avail them- selves of language's emotive power to cover up their unmerited assump- tions. But the same chapter, for reasons that are far from clear, would denigrate the entire Documents classic on the basis of one passage in one chapter that describes a spectacularly bloody battle with the hyperbolic phrase "pestles floated in the blood."44 No real battle, according to Wang Ch'ung, could have produced such a quantity of blood, nor could the exact depth of the blood flow have been verified in the heat of battle.45 Besides, infantrymen don't carry pestles in battle since they rely on dried provisions, and any blood spilt in battle would have soaked immediately into the parched earth of the battleground. What seems a rather comical obsession with absolute literalness in language ties up with larger concerns in the Lun heng, concerns with consistency and with rule-making (in which I detect a serious confusion in Wang's mind between fact and value, between minor rhetorical vic- tories and truth).46 Let us turn to consider a dialogue titled "Questions Put to Confucius" ("Wen K'ung"), which cites anecdotes recorded in the Confucian Analects to challenge the supreme authority of recorded tra- ditions about Confucius (though Wang carefully disclaims any intention to attack directly the authority of the Supreme Sage himself).47 There Wang seeks to prove two contentions: first, that the traditions recording Confucius' "words had no fixed direction," and second, that Confucius' "conduct failed to represent a constant effort."48 Expanding on his theme Philosophy East &amp; West 142</page><page sequence="11">of Confucius' inconsistency, Wang insists that the Confucius of tradition was both an unsuccessful teacher and a bad behavioral model (the same word, shih, can mean both "teacher" and "model"), for seven main reasons: 1. Confucius asked his disciples questions whose answers he should have known if he were indeed a sage; 2. Confucius wasted his breath by posing questions whose answers were bound to prove unilluminating; 3. Confucius supplied incomplete, confusing, or contradictory answers to his disciples, answers that failed to resolve all their questions; worse, Confucius' actions were no more instructive than his pro- nouncements, with the result that "later generations have been left in doubt" on a number of issues; 4. Confucius was insufficiently precise in his language when assessing his own talents and the talents of others; 5. Confucius resorted to "vulgar" (su) behavior when defending himself against charges of misconduct; 6. Confucius, like any ordinary soul, was swayed by the extreme emo- tions of grief and despair, unable to accept Heaven's fate with the perfect equanimity that defines the sage; 7. Confucius let his sympathies for his fellow men interfere with his ab- solute rigor in rule-making.49 In short, the Confucius known to Han tradition failed miserably to exemplify in his life the two salient features of sagehood, a state that Wang tends to equate with absolute consistency: first, the recognition that "fixed rules" govern every single social situation, so that no accom- modation for human exigencies is needed or expected, and second, the idea that precise language should be used for every single entity or event, so as to circumvent the vulgar longing for the dramatic, the poetic, the metaphysical, the nonliteral, and the imprecise.50 (Objections that are similar in kind, but even more vitriolic in tone, are directed against Mencius in another Lun heng chapter.)51 I suggest that Wang's so-called "balanced treatises" are badly flawed whenever they assess ethical issues. Four reasons account for this. First, nearly all the objections leveled against Confucius demonstrate Wang's utter failure to understand the possible use of paradox, irony, exaggera- tion, intentional ambiguity, contradiction, and even the rhetorical ques- tion in teaching ethics.52 Wang is either unable or unwilling to concede that a moral exemplar might carefully adjust his remarks in order to supply a more efficacious remedy for the individual personality flaws of his disciples. Second, in general Wang Ch'ung tends to reduce ethical problems to matters whose resolution may be accomplished through greater factual accuracy. Wang at one point, for example, redefines Goodness essentially in terms of the successful accumulation of data.53 Michael Nylan 143</page><page sequence="12">Wang thus identifies true classical learning (the kind most deserving of rewards by the Han government) with "knowing how to level objections, and knowing how to ask questions."54 One of the most revealing of Wang Ch'ung's comments concerns an event recorded in the Analects, when Confucius admits to his disciple Tzu-lu that he finds it hard to frame an adequate explanation for his own seemingly inconsistent conduct. Wang draws from this a startling con- clusion: "If [even the disciple] Tzu-lu could stump Confucius [in an ar- gument], surely Confucius ought not to have served in office."55 In other words, if Confucius didn't have a ready response to every question put to him, so that he could counter any objection in debate, Confucius was patently unworthy to advise government, let alone be seen as a sage. Third, by asking questions and issuing challenges, Wang hopes to devise a rule-based ethical system to replace the more complex, yet flexible, philosophical vision found in the Analects and in later Con- fucian masterworks.56 For instance, Wang Ch'ung excoriates Mencius for taking a gift in one situation and refusing it in another: "There is an order for accepting [a gift] and an order for not accepting [a gift]," he insists, implying with some exasperation that there must be an order for every single human situation.57 Not surprisingly, Wang Ch'ung tends to elevate mere consistency to the rank of supreme virtue, demanding of the good person not only consistency in ultimate inspiration, but also consistency down to the very form and detail of actions. In the Lun heng, therefore, Wang's chief characterization of the noble man is he whose Goodness is "consistent." Wickedness, on the other hand, is largely equated in Wang's writings with inconsistency.58 The petty man, how- ever noble or brilliant at times, is woefully inconsistent in his acts, which shows in the quality of his writing.59 Fourth, to promote better his own quite narrow view of Goodness, Wang Ch'ung seeks to establish rigorous distinctions between certain classes of men and types of activity; having established such classi- fications, Wang tends to discount the possibility of any exceptions to his rule.60 Accordingly, Confucius is chastised for taking insufficient care to separate himself from all taint of ordinariness; he should always have refused to interact with ordinary people of commoner status. No "real" sage would have condescended to take the advice of his social inferiors.61 If Wang is to promote his worldview, a view in which factual order reigns supreme, the Lun heng must go beyond the logic of the "excluded middle" ("A thing is either C or not-C") to propound what I term the logic of "excluded humanity" ("Human beings by types must each re- flect a single rule")-and this despite Wang's insistence on human vari- ability in side arguments where such an admission proves rhetorically useful. According to Wang, a true worthy, let alone a sage, must be "one and the same, from beginning to end."62 This consistency over the Philosophy East &amp; West 144</page><page sequence="13">course of a single lifetime ought also to prevail across the ages, not only because "Worthies share the same principles, ... maintaining in com- mon the [same] ideals"-a common enough assertion by Han Ju-but also because the very same few types and combinations of ch'i have been mandating conditions in the world since the dawn of civilization.63 Thus, the actions, impulses, and inherent natures of certain men in a stated category, according to Wang, will be identical in every detail to those of later men in the same class.64 Wang even reckons the level of anger felt by one sage confronted with evil to be the same as the anger experienced by another sage facing a similar situation.65 In fairness, Wang's insistence on virtual identities between similar cases, just like his insistence that an ideal world would see the exact same literary expression used for every similar human case,66 in large part stems from rhetorical necessity. Unless Wang in the dialogue can establish such virtual identities for the purposes of argument, Wang cannot retain the air of logical rigor in framing his debating points while plundering his phenomenal memory for all sorts of disparate information ferreted out from old books.67 But playing this rhetorical game also suits Wang, for it allows Wang to keep his advantage as he relentlessly dis- plays his mastery over a certain type of dialogue: the "destructive"68 kind that chiefly seeks to pinpoint all the inconsistencies in a hypo- thetical opponent's view. Wang is, in some sense, the first of the ch'ing- t'an ("pure talk") masters.69 Wang's overinsistence on consistency and his propensity to frame absolute rules can be traced to at least three other main sources: the sociopolitical, the theoretical, and the personal. First, the sociopolitical: in retrospect, it is easy to see that many of Wang's attempts at rigid cate- gorizing parallel the increasingly fixed sociopolitical divisions that ac- companied reinfeudation in the late Eastern Han, insofar as many of Wang's presuppositions and "logical" categories are clearly class-based, rather than "logical"; they aim to preserve and defend the socioeconomic status quo against what Wang regards as the muddleheaded egalitarian- ism of earlier scholastic traditions.70 (It is interesting that Wang Ch'ung believes his own talents to have been badly undervalued by the very hierarchy that he so rigorously upholds.) Far from representing an in- cisive skeptical attack on the Confucian ideology or "Confucian" in- stitutions associated with Han rule, Wang Ch'ung's Lun heng tends to support, rather than subvert, some of the most conservative aspects of mainstream classical learning in the Han, despite the book's quibbles with influential classicists on specific points.71 Wang argues, after all, that there is little, if anything, that a person can do to improve his place in the preordained hierarchy.72 Then there is the theoretical: Heaven, by Wang's definition, cannot issue contradictory commands,73 for at any given moment a single reality Michael Nylan 145</page><page sequence="14">is generated by a single cosmic fact (the systematic unfolding and con- junction of patterned ch'i, whose operations remain absolutely unaffected by human desires or the gods' commands). This single fact, then, rather than a variety of factors (including the effect of virtuous conduct), man- dates the operation of all human fate in all ages alike, past and present.74 In consequence, Wang feels that critical minds such as his ought to be able to establish binding definitions and rules to apply to each type of situation and each category; once these are established, human beings will no longer be misled by the kind of factual misinformation that he alleges has spawned moral and practical dilemmas in abundance.75 If government really intends to flourish, Wang says, the government in bureaucratic searches should ascertain a man's worth by one readily applicable test: can the candidate for public office best his opponent in public debate by ferreting out all of his opponent's logical errors? "Only when two blades clash, one against the other, is the sharper blade known. Only when two essays are compared, one against the other, do the rights and wrongs become apparent."76 Wang, in putting forward this pro- posal, inadvertently reveals his hand: he is determined to use the Lun heng to prove that his own superior abilities in debate would have made him an ideal candidate for public office-and now, at his advanced age, qualify him for public acclaim and a role as an adviser to the emperor.77 Loving art more than argument-the mastery of rhetorical conventions more than ethical content-the personal intervenes. Sadly for philosophy, Wang's own delight in "gymnastic rhetoric" so far exceeds his commitment to Goodness (adopting Wang's presupposi- tion that Goodness implies "consistency") that the Lun heng willingly contradicts its own arguments, if such tactics help to trounce an oppo- nent in debate.78 Wang's compulsion to vanquish his adversaries thor- oughly means that Wang, ever the relentless and resourceful debater, readily resorts to any plausible argument to silence an opponent. And Wang does. not hesitate to argue "from a lodging place."79 (In other words, Wang frequently adopts his opponent's faulty presuppositions temporarily, the better to advertise the internal inconsistencies endemic to those arguments-even at the risk of appearing false to his own prin- ciples.)80 As a result, Wang Ch'ung is usually consistent within single chapters, each of which represents a single debate, but is frequently in- consistent across chapters. For instance, Wang's most famous hypothesis (that almost all aspects of human existence are predetermined at birth), an idea to which he devotes no fewer than eighteen chapters of the Lun heng, is flatly ignored when Wang turns elsewhere to a conventional treatment of the related subjects of human nature and learning.81 Under such conditions, it becomes nearly impossible for even the most careful reader of the Lun heng to decide which of the numerous propositions that Wang sets forth with dazzling verbal pyrotechnics ac- Philosophy East &amp; West 146</page><page sequence="15">tually constitute Wang's true beliefs. The very few assertions from which Wang seldom deviates principally reflect Wang's preoccupation with his own current status and future fame. For instance, Wang's repeated in- sistence that every form of material success or fame is entirely the prod- uct of preordained fate, rather than of virtue or talent,82 finally explains very little beyond Wang's own lackluster career. In consequence, readers are left with the distinct impression that Wang's text offers scant guid- ance as they try to sort out the answers to life's most troubling ethical questions. In fact, all too frequently, Wang's impulse is to deny that there are any hard choices to be made at all in life, once a master like himself has sorted out the factual errors promulgated by lesser men.83 There is an emotional subtext here that quickly becomes embarrass- ingly obvious to even the novice reader of Wang Ch'ung's Lun heng: barely suppressed rage informs much of Wang Ch'ung's writing (espe- cially in the key chapters that close the Lun heng, including Wang's chapters on "Ascertaining the Worthy" ["Ting hsien"], "Explanation for Writing" ["Shu chieh"], "Reply on Innovation" ["Tui tso"], and Wang's Autobiography).84 As Wang Ch'ung saw it, he was repeatedly and un- justifiably passed over for appointment to government office, despite two exceptional qualifications: (a) his mastery of factual knowledge, which far surpasses that of most, if not all, of his contemporaries; and (b) his ability to convey that mastery in persuasive dialogues, an ability which many in high office could not hope to equal.85 It is this unexpected in- trusion of the personal in Wang's writing that, in combination with other factors, probably accounted for the relatively low esteem accorded Wang Ch'ung by his contemporaries-and indeed by most thinkers until the twentieth century.86 The "other factors," however, are not to be ignored: the fact that Wang's "balanced" discussions fail to offer any strikingly new way of seeing the world is a direct consequence of Wang's decision to accept the standard rhetorical format and rhetorical goals known from Han scholastic debates, while rejecting other models for the dialogue better fitted to more subtle inquiries.87 Indeed, for Wang to maximize the number of his rhetorical "wins," he had to, as he himself admitted, concur with, even appeal to, the general consensus, placing it in an interesting or flattering light, instead of proposing unconventional hypotheses of undoubted originality.88 Therefore, the form, as well as the content, of the dialogues composed for the Lun heng was governed by Wang's complacent belief that factual data is itself the most profound subject of learning, his concomitant failure to understand the underlying para- doxical premises of the classical Confucian ethical impulse, his decided preference for unambiguous language and simple solutions, and his harsh pessimism about the possibilities of human progress (either personal or societal).89 Michael Nylan 147</page><page sequence="16">That the brilliant promise of Wang's dialogues was also marred to some extent by the author's curious equivocation on key points of doc- trine (the result of Wang's dislike of affronting the political elite and his antipathy to losing) calls to mind an earlier philosophical master's maxim: "[True] disputation is arguing with oneself. Disputing with others lands one in danger."''90 In the end, Wang's early readers were content to dis- miss his dialogues as little more than a rhetorician's "plaything," an "aid in conversation."91 Yang Hsiung. As a final example of a Han thinker's use of the philo- sophic dialogue, I now turn to Yang Hsiung, whose intended use of the dialogue differs markedly from that of either Ying Shao or Wang Ch'ung.92 Insofar as the instruction presented by both Ying Shao and Wang Ch'ung is fundamentally didactic in nature, Ying Shao and Wang Ch'ung could just as easily have presented their ideas in essay form, had they not desired the greater dramatic impact that the dialogue affords.93 The successful presentation of Yang Hsiung's arguments in the Fa yen, in contrast, absolutely requires the literary fiction of the dialogue, in the same manner that Plato's dialogues do. For in Yang Hsiung's Fa yen, the dialogue form is employed not merely to establish fact or to query vulgar convention, but also painstakingly to construct a compelling argument from a collection of seemingly disparate ideas whose relation and even importance are inherently not amenable to logical proof. Yang Hsiung apparently prefers the dialectical montage precisely because that form, in his deft hand, requires the reader to experience bewilderment, to arrive at syntheses and deduce relations from provocatively-and pro- vokingly-incomplete information, to rethink conventional terminology in counterintuitive ways, and to be led gradually to acknowledge the ignorant assumptions out of which she has constructed her sense of reality.94 Yang's dialogues, then, do not in general teach particular lessons. Rather, they guide the reader slowly to learn to prefer, and next to un- dertake, extremely complex practices of self-shaping-practices whose very reliance upon alternately questioning the conventional and forging meaningful pattern mimics the dialogue form of the Fa yen text itself. Thus, Yang Hsiung's chosen style of the dialogue is itself designed to promote a therapeutic exercise that seeks a final convergence of various insights attained by the author, the reader, and the models provided by the former sages.95 I would also argue that Yang, with his pronounced flair for the dra- matic and an explicit interest in the problem of form versus content,96 chooses to write in dialogue precisely because through its form he can emphasize the profound interconnectedness of all experience. Believing that "The Way of Man is to forge connections,""97 Yang Hsiung saw that Philosophy East &amp; West 148</page><page sequence="17">beliefs about certain topics (virtue, the Way, equity, and evil) do not exist as isolated clusters in our lives; "they form sheer endless chains which ... help to determine our whole life and the life of the society." 98The fictional dialogues so carefully constructed by Yang Hsiung do indeed suggest the endless chains of connected thoughts from which we con- struct meaning in our lives, with one topic sliding, almost unnoticed, into another. To give some idea of how Yang Hsiung's Fa yen works, I give a synopsis of a single page from the original text in the first chapter, titled "Encouraging Learning." The chapter opens with a precept: regarding study of the Ancients, it is best to practice it, second best to speak of it, and third best to teach it to others. Those who do not practice, speak, or teach the Way of the Ancients are said to be "ordinary persons." The succeeding passage breaks the presumed tie between "love of learning" and "learning longevity techniques," insisting that "love of learning," properly defined, seeks no particular goal but Goodness itself. Next comes a critique of contemporary classical scholars, who fail to transmit accurately the teachings of Confucius, because of their propensity for overelaboration and invention. Would that classical scholars had "metal mouths and wooden tongues" (meaning, would that they were more cautious about their pronouncements, regarding each as infinitely weighty).99 Then an objection is leveled: the study of the Ancients is of no use, says Yang's representative of convention. "What about substance!"100 To this, Yang Hsiung replies with a comparison: Learning is to human nature as whetting is to the knife; the knife, however fine its original substance, is only of use after it has been sharpened. Human beings, by analogy, are only of use after they have studied the Ancients, which study (predicated on praxis, rather than on erudition) hones their original nature. Then Yang turns to the topic of imitation, first "proving" that imita- tion is "natural" since imitative behavior occurs even in the natural world of Heaven-and-Earth, and then locating the single cause of human achievement in the individual's imitation of the sage's greatness. From imitation, the dialogue shifts to the allied topic of fame: why is it better to win renown for following the Way than to win renown for having certain practical skills? Both, after all, can end in lasting fame. Yang answers by a suggestive poetic image: streams pale in comparison to great rivers; hills pale in comparison to great mountains. So do ordinary exploits when compared with a truly noble endeavor. Then comes a question about alchemy, where Yang deftly slides from talk of casting metal to talk of casting men in the proper mold. And in this vein the first Fa yen dialogue proceeds. What seems at first glance a haphazard (occasionally infuriating) pastiche of definitions, observa- Michael Nylan 149</page><page sequence="18">tions, proverbs, and metaphors in fact manages to score two important points: it mocks conventional judgments about professional classicists and "proper" learning (e.g., that it should be of use, that it should focus on something of "substance," that it should aim at some form of material success), while setting forth a key proposition: that imitation of the truly great, rather than mastery of set texts, theories, and techniques, is the proper definition of "love of learning." With this kind of dialogue re- peated throughout the text, the Fa yen seeks to have the reader test whether the whole of her life can conceivably be squared with her beliefs on any single given topic. Baldly put, Yang Hsiung's intention in the Fa yen is to convince the reader (often through the puzzling juxtaposition of a host of un- answered and unanswerable questions, through analogy, through irony, and through paradox) of four linked propositions. First, an important distinction exists between the "vulgar" Ju vision, exemplified by many of those currently in power, and that of the "true" Ju, defined as those who are faithful to the original vision of the Sage-Master Confucius. Second, "vulgar" Ju badly misperceive the Confucian life. Insofar as they asso- ciate it with material (usually bureaucratic) success, they must reduce its subtle signposts to overly simplistic formulas, and insofar as they confuse the Confucian Way with either factual knowledge or with rule-making, they fail to undertake the therapeutic journey toward Goodness that en- tails identification with historical and contemporary examples of the "good man."101 Third, the very process of learning to perceive and value the sage's intent embodied in the "true" Ju vision so refines the learner's being that the learner is able eventually to experience for the first time the most exquisite form of pleasure known to humankind, a pleasure akin to, but better than, aesthetic connoisseurship.102 And fourth, this kind of pleasure is ultimately the only sure reward available to humans for the exercise of virtue. Yang Hsiung's Fa yen is quite remarkable, then, for the clarity with which it presents a single idea embedded in both the Confucian Analects and the Chuang tzu: the idea that true virtue elicits supreme pleasure, an "immeasurable joy" reserved only for the discriminating few.103 In effect, the Fa yen issues a challenge to members of the Han sociopolitical elite to become a true elite whose proclivities and capacities for exquisite sensitivity would far excel those of ordinary individuals. One might say, then, that the Fa yen tempts the reader to engage in Confucian pursuits by a simultaneous appeal to a person's best instincts (the desire to be greater than oneself) and to her worst (greed, envy, and the egotistical desire for ever keener pleasures).104 In an expanded form, Yang's argument goes something like this: the vulgar Ju are interested in the Confucian Way only to the degree that it may bring them the delights of the conventionally defined good life; they Philosophy East &amp; West 150</page><page sequence="19">assume a kind of crude cause-and-effect relation between the mastery of Confucian texts or practices and acquiring worldly pleasure. But since no course of study can ever fully guarantee wealth, high position, sen- sual pleasure, or extended longevity, the life of the vulgar Ju tends to be one of continual disappointment. To convey a vivid sense of the intense frustration felt by ordinary Ju105 is vitally important to Yang Hsiung in his Fa yen dialogues for two strategic reasons: Yang must first explain why so many of the "best and the brightest" of the classically trained elite men have turned away from what they identify as the Confucian project. Yang's explanation: these men, sensing the unsatisfactory character of most Ju lives, blame Confucianism itself, rather than bad teachers, bad books, and bad opinions, for their predicament. Yang must then go on to explain why the "true" Confucian vision, utterly reliant upon contact with the most provocative teachers (to be found both in books and in real life), is the only satisfactory solution to the puzzle called human ex- istence: only this experience yields the keenest sort of pleasure, one that comes in direct and appropriate response to all aspects of our human nature, rather than in unnatural opposition to our human drives.106 In successive passages of the Fa yen, Yang Hsiung paints the fol- lowing portrait of the "true" Ju: accepting the tenuous relation between virtue and fate, the true Ju wastes little emotional energy or intellectual effort on the conventional goals of long life, wealth, and high rank, for he realizes that these goals are largely beyond his control.107 Without them, the true Ju is free to focus on a more penetrating question: what sort of activity, given human nature, will yield maximum satisfaction over the course of a human life? Speaking for the true Ju, Yang Hsiung concludes that the study of the ancients (with the final goal of full immersion in and merging with the personality of the sages) is the single activity most likely to yield exquisite, enduring, and reliable pleasure.108 (The best analogy Yang can find for this kind of pleasure is that of connoisseurship, al- though the subject to be appreciated is not food, drink, sex, or visual delights, but the former sages' intent.) Immersion in the sages is shown to be best for two reasons. First, as the only human pleasure that is fully internalized, this form of pleasure, unlike the normal sensory pleasures, can never be taken away by others, nor is it dependent upon external circumstances for its operation.109 Second, and even more importantly, only this pleasurable immersion in true Confucian models can satisfy all aspects of human nature, with its mixture of good and evil,110 for the immersion responds simultaneously to both a person's best instincts and his worst. For Yang, the most deep- seated of human impulses is the very human desire to identify with and become part of something greater and more enduring than oneself,1' which is itself the seed of the human potential for good. But if part of the basic nature is not to remain unfulfilled, more than Michael Nylan 151</page><page sequence="20">the good in human nature must be aroused. Therefore, Yang would also call into the service of morality even greed, envy, and what the Greeks would call pleonexia (the relentless drive for more)-impulses that typi- cally define the human potential for evil. Yang's dramatic dialogues are careful to evoke the ordinary person's urgent desire to possess (as a kind of consumer item)12 the greatest boons known to his fellow human be- ings, then to promise that these baser impulses will be satisfied once the learner knows the exquisite pleasure of "true" Confucian pursuits. Ac- cording to Yang Hsiung, without this rigorous commitment to the in- tegrated Confucian vision embodied in the sages, the person inevitably remains somewhat less than "whole," for all other human commitments in appealing to either the good or the bad can only hope to gratify part of the basic human drives.113 The seemingly impractical task of complete identification with the sages (i.e., the Confucian Way) represents, then, the ultimate in utility for human beings.114 No less paradoxically, it is this perfect fulfillment of human nature that we term "divinity" (shen).115 Yang Hsiung concedes, as numerous hypothetical objections are leveled against his view, that the former sages' mind is known only to the self-selected few:116 those few who are willing to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the hermeneutical task of total "immersion" in the sages' moral examples. This admission is not designed to reserve the exquisite pleasures of the "true" Confucian experience for the tiny socioeconomic elite in the Han, however, since Yang, like all good Confucian masters before him, insists repeatedly that all have been en- dowed with the moral potential to become sages, so all should aim to become sages.117 With Yang, it seems, talk of the select few is meant to pique the readers' interest in the true Confucian experience by appeals to an elitist spirit, for Yang feels sure that once his readers have had a taste of the indescribable pleasures associated with Goodness, they will soon become addicted to it.118 Yang is well aware that it will not be easy to wean the vulgar "faithful" (self-identified Ju, who fail to see the true Confucian vision) from the present shallow self-satisfaction they take in slavish imitation of the outer forms of ritualized behavior, behavior that they erroneously believe sets them apart from "lesser" men.119 Yang says that it is a far less daunting task to construct the finest phrases in fu than it is to con- vince another of the therapeutic value of the sages' model. It is harder still to convince readers of the incredible (and inviolable) pleasure to be had from faithful imitation of and appreciation for the former sages' moral sense,120 so that the reader will be induced to undertake the difficult journey by which perceptive humans come to identify with and partic- ipate in patterns far greater than themselves. The true Ju's joy, like the connoisseur's pleasure, must be fully experienced before it is fully understood. Philosophy East &amp; West 152</page><page sequence="21">Yet Yang must marshal every effort to persuade, for humans are less likely to come to value Confucianism through their vague preference for health (a preference that fails to motivate behavioral change until they are decrepit, when it is already too late)121 than through their desire for pleasure, an insistent voice that operates powerfully at all times. Working against his persuasions, as Yang is honest enough to admit, is another undeniable, if paradoxical fact: while the committed learner (symbolized by Yen Hui) finds his "greatest pleasure" in a thrilling insight into the enormous possibilities of true human greatness (as exemplified in the sages, especially Confucius), this very recognition necessarily engen- ders some degree of continual pain and anxiety, given the huge gap that lies between the learner's present moral self and full perfection: "This very bitterness: it is [the committed student's] only reason for joy!'"122 Through a series of passages suggesting that immersion in the Five Classics yields pleasures akin to, though greater than, the more generally recognized delights to be had by connoisseurs who sup on fine foods, hear sumptuous music, enjoy sex with rare beauties, and see beautiful things,123 Yang hopes to persuade his readers to undertake the difficult task of following the Way. One passage, for example, compares the Five Classics to the exquisite tastes appreciated only by those "in the know": To abandon what is always valued in order to have a taste of strange foods, that is to regard with contempt the tastes of those in the know. To cast aside the great sages and prefer the Hundred Philosophers, that is to look with contempt upon the Way of those in the know.124 As "it is only [the sages] who truly see and hear," the committed student must learn to see and hear better through emulation of those few humans who know how properly to use all their faculties: "The ears of worthy men are selective, as are their mouths; the masses have no selectivity in them."125 Why is the arduous effort worth it? Yang answers: Perceptiveness in the ears and eyes, is it not the ultimate [human experience]? To be unperceptive in hearing is really to lack ears. To be unperceptive in seeing is really to lack eyes. [Interlocutor:] "I beg to ask what great percep- tiveness in hearing and seeing is?" [Yang's] reply: "... It is only Heaven that is perceptive in hearing; only Heaven that is perceptive in seeing. He who raises his eyes [to view Heaven's patterns] and lowers his ears [to hear the wise on earth], is he not [himself] Heaven?"126 Unless we are determined to develop sage-like perspicuity, we remain virtual country bumpkins, unable to experience the most subtle and gratifying of sensual pleasures. Ultimately, however, making this com- mitment depends upon us. Theadvice of good friends and teachers, Michael Nylan 153</page><page sequence="22">even the wisdom of great books, is useless unless we ourselves already feel the need to embrace that commitment. As Yang writes: [In reply to the question of why the sages' examples are subject to variant interpretations:] The blind [music-master] K'uang can enforce silence [in his audience], but he cannot make unequal ears equal [in their ability to appre- ciate his music]. [The famous cook] Yi Ya can blend [the most exquisite flavors], but he cannot make unequal mouths equal [in their ability to appre- ciate his cooking].... I have seen no case in which an earth-shattering talent has influenced the deaf and dumb.127 Through paradox, irony, and the startling juxtaposition of successive powerful images, the Fa yen dialogues leave the reader aghast at his own prior lack of comprehension about the definition of true "greatness" and weeping at the paltriness of his supposed former triumphs. Prompted by such realizations, Yang's readers may take the next step and firmly commit themselves to attaining that norm of full perfection.128 But because change, rather than constancy, rules the phenomenal world, this norm of perfection, however constant in its ability to inspire, will appear to vary once it is applied to changed circumstances in the real world.129 As a result, true Confucianism (defined as devotion to, delight in, and appreciation of the sages, who by definition conform to the larger cosmic patterns) allows a wide range of activity that promotes community.130 Faced with the sheer complexity of moral decision- making, the student of Goodness asks Yang Hsiung what the supremely Good (jen) man would do in such a circumstance. Yang's response is to portray examples of human perfection as guiding lights for moral decision-making, rather than as bases for any sort of rule-based mor- ality.131 In Yang Hsiung's summary of morality, "Confucius imitated the Duke of Chou and Yen Hui imitated Confucius."132 Yang Hsiung therefore simply refuses to employ the dialogue in the same manner as Wang Ch'ung: to dictate strict adherence to linguistic and sociopolitical conventions. In his highly imaginative use of the dialogue form, in his insistence on the profound pleasures to be gained from "keeping company" with the sages, in his search for the Mean coupled with his profound distrust of rules, in his paradoxical association of true humanity with ultimate divinity, in his belief that death is preferable to a rejection of the philo- sophical good life, and even in his insistence that the pursuit of true Goodness has no other end than itself,133 Yang Hsiung proposes certain basic conclusions about ethical questions that bring to mind discussions in Plato's Gorgias (some of which are expanded in Aristotle's Nicho- machean Ethics), conclusions whose "proof" depends upon the dexter- ous use of the dialogue form, just as surely as those of Plato do. It is odd, then, that Plato's place is forever secure within the Western philosoph- Philosophy East &amp; West Philosophy East &amp; West 154</page><page sequence="23">ical canon, while Yang's works have been largely ignored by a public that professes to scorn them as "unoriginal." Conclusion This essay has put forward three basic propositions: that the major works of the Han masters working in the classical tradition are often skeptical, seldom derivative, and highly self-conscious in their use of the dialogue.134 Modern readers may assume that "classicism" invariably excludes "innovation," but Han classicists were ever mindful of Con- fucius' injunction to "remake the old." In "remaking the old," the best of the Han writers often chose to use the dialogue form to answer the great question that preoccupied them: why had the state sponsorship of Confucian learning failed to advance general morality or political stability? This essay has discussed three quite different answers to that question, the strength of whose logic finally depended as much upon the varying forms, as upon the differ- ent contents of the dialogues: Ying Shao argued that the classically trained political elite no longer epitomized the true classical values stated in the early Confucian texts; Ying's mock dialogues therefore pitted infallible traditions against fallible humans, condemning current practice in light of ancient norms in a particularly theatrical way. Wang Ch'ung insisted that the Han government and its elites had failed to appoint men of sufficient worth, where "worth" was defined in terms of the ability to defeat an opponent in public debate; his dialogues, suitably enough, showed Wang invariably routing his adversaries in rhetorical contests cleverly contrived to spotlight Wang's encyclopedic knowledge, lin- guistic precision, and analytical skills. Yang Hsiung believed that the state sponsorship of Confucian learn- ing, ironically enough, had contributed to his fellow classicists' mis- understanding of the nature of classical learning and Goodness, with the result that many had missed their chances for supreme happiness; his dialogues interject unconventional remarks and troubling questions, so that the reader, if he is to make any sense of them at all, is brought to realize both his own basic immaturity and the essential sterility of pre- vailing wisdom, twin realizations that are preconditions for forming new moral insights. Any one of these three hypotheses, if bluntly stated, might well have landed its author in jail; it was widely known that neither the centralized Han state nor its high officials had much patience with their most outspoken critics.135 Hence, the ultimate charm of the dialogue for its author may have lain in its plausible deniability; after all, with "dou- bled persuasions," alternating speakers, and rival points of view, it was usually left to the reader to arrive at the author's most negative insinuations. Michael Nylan 155</page><page sequence="24">Each of these Han authors was looking to construct a unified theory that would account equally well for the history of Confucianism and the history of the dynasty. At the same time, all three authors sought fresh solutions to recurrent problems engendered by the very imperial struc- tures (not the least, the state's academic apparatus) that claimed to pro- mote an ancient moral vision. What is perhaps most remarkable is that none of these authQrs found it rhetorically useful to radically simplify the past in order to construct a reductionist history of the orthodox line of transmission from Confucius, as later self-identified Confucians were wont to do. (Perhaps the classical tradition associated with Confucianism in Han times as yet faced no threats grave enough to require such ex- treme measures.) Nor did these Han thinkers, in assessing their own classical tradition, evince that uncritical obsession with the past that Orientalists insist is characteristic of all Chinese.136 To read any of these authors, then, is to confront, even across time, the crucial limits and real possibilities of the Ju tradition in the Han, precisely because their care- fully framed dialogues had the power to dramatize fierce tensions and competing points of view within the scholarly community.

Tianjin: Renmin, 1980. 1 - For Tao-hsieh's scornful treatment of Han Confucians, see Sun Ch'i-feng's Li hsoeh tsung chuan (compiled 1666), which accords Michael Nylan 157</page><page sequence="26">no Han thinker (and only five Han commentators) the title "[orthodox] Confucian." Hsiung Tzu-li's Hsjeh t'ung (compiled 1685), chaps. 36-37, sees many Han classicists as "appending the orthodox lineage" (fu-t'ung), but chap. 44 condemns Yang Hsiung for his "eclectic" (tsa) views. For the best overview of or- thodox Neo-Confucian teachings concerning the "genealogy of the Way," see Thomas A. Wilson, "Genealogy and History in Neo-Confucian Sectarian Uses of the Confucian Past," Modern China 20 (1) (January 1994): 3-33. 2 - The proper distinction between "Confucian" and Ju (professional classicists) is not easily made, especially after 136 B.C., when most literati, regardless of their convictions, would have found it profit- able to associate themselves with the study of the Five Classics, then (if not originally) associated with Confucius. It is obvious, e.g., that Ju cannot be translated in the LH unthinkingly as "Con- fucian," since chap. 24 of that book talks of "Ju texts" that cele- brate immortals (LH 24:145). Most Han works suggest wide var- iations in theory and practice within the Ju community. E.g., Tung Chung-shu's third memorial to Wu Ti remarks, "At present teach- ers propagate strange principles; our fellow human beings hold to unusual practices; the many schools of thought have idiosyncratic methods and the conclusions to which they point are not identi- cal." See HSPC 56/19a (trans. Loewe [1994]). In LH 82 : 562 ff., Wang Ch'ung describes many different kinds of Ju, including the wen Ju ("literary Ju") and the shih Ju ("worldly Ju," whose erudi- tion has won them high office). 3 - For Yang Hsiung, see, e.g., FY 3:7, which alleges that few stu- dents of Confucius successfully emulate the Sage-Master, and FY 6:16, which implies a comparison between contemporary Ju and "those who pluck my flowers without eating my fruit" (i.e., those who accept the showy part of Confucianism, but not its essential message). For Wang's disparaging treatment of ordinary Ju who are only "knowledgeable about the Classics," see LH 80:545, which equates ordinary Confucians with mere "transmitters" and fustian antiquarians. Cf. LH 81 :551, which claims that the early Ju masters "fabricated false theories out of thin air," after which their sycophantic disciples repeated the most preposterous lies. Wang tends to despise those of his contemporaries whose classical scholarship has not fitted them for public office. In LH 57:388, e.g., Wang charges that contemporary literati "do not know what sagehood is when we ask them." And in LH 28: 182, Wang states that "The classical scholars [celebrated by] the age cannot truth- fully speak of right and wrong." P o tf4 Philosophy East &amp; West 158</page><page sequence="27">4 - Ying Shao, in his preface to the FSTY presents himself as a true Ju intent upon restoring order and civility to an empire ravaged by war and superstition. For Yang Hsiung, see FY 1:1, which states that Ju tradition is to be valued because it alone transmits the theories of Confucius. Whether to characterize Wang Ch'ung as Confucian or Taoist has been a topic of dispute down through the ages, with most intellectual historians stumbling over Wang's eclecticism, despite the fact that all the major Han Confucian figures were highly eclectic. In any case, by Wang's own account, Wang is a Ju, for it is the Ju who are the principal conservators of the social order (p'ien 29, 35); it is also they who see their task as "asking questions and posing difficulties" (84:576), just as Wang does. Several chapters, including LH 29 and 83, defend the es- sential superiority of the Ju teachings over Mohist and Legalist teachings. Wang sees himself as a "great Ju" (hung Ju), meaning the best sort of scholar, one trained in the past, like the fellow classicists of his own age (shih Ju), but with no undue reverence for the past or the Five Classics (p'ien 39). Wang, therefore, sharply distinguishes himself from the "vulgar" Ju among his contemporaries (shih Ju and su Ju). Wang Ch'ung is often called a Taoist, but it is clear from LH 24 and 80 that Wang despises what he identifies as Taoist ex- periments to achieve immortality and the Taoist preference for reclusion. Wang in LH 80:544 also sharply criticizes the followers of Lao tzu for what he sees as their essential selfishness. Finally, many LH passages (e.g., LH 80:537) insist on the sage's absolute ability to ascertain truth, an insistence that denies the basic Taoist proposition that "Your life has a limit but knowledge has none. If you use what is limited to pursue what has no limit, you will be in danger" (Chuang tzu, chap. 3). 5 - Contra immortality, see FSTY, chaps. 2, 9; FY 12:39-40; LH 24. Contra the gods and ghosts controlling men's lives, see FSTY chap. 9. Wang Ch'ung and Yang Hsiung agree that the only un- seen force that informs human existence is fate (ming) or timing (shih), though they sharply disagree about the degree to which fate or time controls human outcomes. For the LH on fate, see chaps. 1-7, 48:335, 52 :355-358, etc. For the FY see 10:28-32. Wang's statement that Heaven has nothing to do with man could well have come from FY 6:16, which describes Heaven and the sages in the same terms, as self-motivated to development in their own separate spheres. Of the existence of spirits and prodigies, Yang remarks that sometimes they appear to exist, and sometimes not (FY 10:28); Wang Ch'ung uses almost the exact same language in Michael Nylan 159</page><page sequence="28">LH 62:414 and 23:141, as does Ying Shao in FSTY 9:71. For arguments against major differences in past and present, see, e.g., FSTY prefatory remarks to chap. 2; the basic argument in LH 16; and the concluding remarks to FY 2. Contra the Mencian five- hundred-year cycle, see FSTY chap. 1, devoted to historical cy- cles in ancient Chinese history, which offers an alternative theory to replace the Mencian theory. LH 30 :209-210 and FY8 :21 also specifically refute the Mencian theory. 6 - For Wang Ch'ung and Ying Shao, see LH 8:34, 27:175, and FSTY 1 : 1. Yang probably alludes to this tradition in THC 10/app. 1-3, 28/app. 3, 78/app. 1. 7 - For Yang Hsiung's self-assessment, see FY 2:6. For the popular stories about Duke Ting of Sung and the music master K'uei, see FSTY 2 :9-10, 17, and LH 16:89. Note that these stories are re- peated in many Han works, including the LSCC and the HNT Yang Hsiung joins in the attack against alchemists in FY 1:1, 12:40. Further similarities between these three works may be noted. E.g., all three works treat the legends of immortals, such as Prince Tan of Yen, with considerable skepticism. See FY 1: 1, 11 :39-40, 12:40; LH 16:90, 52:355; and FSTY 2:13. For at- tacks against current taboos, see FY 3 :8, LH chaps. 68-69, and FSTY 2 :20. Finally, consider these three authors' balanced treat- ment of Tung Chung-shu, a figure revered as the Father of Han Confucianism, but ridiculed for his credulous attitudes, as re- corded in FY 3: 7 vs. FY 11 :35; FSTY 9: 73; and LH 22:130-135, 45:313, 47:327-332. For further information, see Huang Hui's 1935 annotated version of ch. 47 of the Lun heng chi chieh (Commercial Press, reprints 1938 and 1969). 8 - In the original AAS paper, I spoke of a "skeptical tradition," but Richard H. Popkin's The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Descartes (Assen, 1960) has convinced me that the term "skep- ticism" should be reserved for thinkers who propose to suspend judgment on all questions for which there seems to be conflicting evidence, including the question of whether or not something can be known; hence, my use of "critical tradition" here. On HsUn tzu's place in the Han: there is no question that HsUn tzu was re- garded by most Western Han thinkers as the most important suc- cessor to the Sage-master, Confucius, although Bernard Karlgren, in "Early History of the Chou ii and Tso chuan texts" (BMFEA 3 [1931], p. 19), has argued that interest in Hson tzu tapers off somewhat by the late Western Han. Nonetheless, Hsin tzu is continually quoted, especially in treatises on aesthetics, on ritual, and on politics. For a generally favorable assessment of Hsin tzu, Philosophy East &amp; West 160</page><page sequence="29">see FY 12:37, which nonetheless laments Hsiin tzu's disdain for numerology. Cf. FSTY 7:52-53, which puts Mencius and Hsin tzu on the same level. I argue that admiration for HsOin tzu is not the best proof of the continuing strength of the critical tradition in the Han because Han classicists often felt free to pick and choose among the earlier master's many arguments. E.g., Tung Chung-shu, according to Liu Hsiang, composed a text in praise of Hsin tzu, although many of Tung's principles directly contra- vened those of Hsion tzu. 9- One frequent criticism leveled against Han scholastics is their failure to test scholastic theories by observation. Judging from the historical record, only the most mediocre of Han scholastics failed in this, for Yang Hsiung, Wang Ch'ung, and Ying Shao all report firsthand observations designed to check theory. For Wang, see LH 32:225-226; for Yang's astronomical experiments, see Huan T'an's Hsin lun, recorded in TPYL 2/6b-7a (Pokora, pp. 116- 117); for Ying, see FSTY 9: 67-68. 10 - None of these writings alleges that the literate members of society are less prone to superstition than the illiterate. FSTY chap. 9 be- gins with two anecdotes that show members of the literate elite (Duke Huan of Ch'i and Tu HsUian of mid-Eastern Han) so fright- ened by strange apparitions that they make themselves sick; the chapter ends with a similar story told of one Ch'iao HsUian, then senior official to the ssu t'u. (There is, of course, the sense that the unlettered are far less able to understand the rituals that they perform.) 11 - For disputation, see J. L. Kroll, "Disputation in Ancient Chinese Culture," Early China 11-12 (1985-1987): 118-145. The Ju ob- jected to the opportunistic ways of some of the "itinerant rhet- oricians" (yu shui) of the Warring States period. 12 - Wang Ch'ung's LH is the only work of the three thinkers to insist that the Han dynasty has, in fact, attained the Great Peace, by Wang's minimal definition of the term: "order and stability." See LH, chaps. 57-59. Other discussions elsewhere in the LH (e.g., in chaps. 80, 84), however, directly contradict Wang's praise for the Han. 13 - Note that the Hsiin tzu, the Han Fei tzu, the Lii shih ch'un ch'iu, and the Huai nan tzu were all written primarily in essay form. The Hsiin tzu has one chapter (chap. 75) in dialogue, the Han Fei tzu, four "Nan" ("Refutations") chapters. Still, the Kuan tzu has a series of chapters in dialogue form, and the Mencius is famous for its dialogues. The Chuang tzu, which contains a number of imagi- Michael Nylan 161</page><page sequence="30">nary dialogues, seems to break all rules. Of the Ch'un Ch'iu fan lu, whose received text has seven chapters in dialogue form, Gary Arbuckle writes, "the Chunqiu fanlu chapters that have the best chance to be from Dong are most of them not in dialog form (exception: chapter 32, 'A reply to the King of Jiaoxi' ...), but some of the chapters that have the best chance of being early ARE dialogs, cf. the first five chapters on the Annals hermeneutics. (Cf. also the 'Replies on the Suburban Sacrifice,' chap. 71 ...)" (written communication, 8 February 1995). Re matters of au- thenticity, cf. Sarah Queen, "From Chronicle to Canon: The Her- meneutics of the Spring and Autumn Annals according to Tung Chung-shu" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard, 1991). In addition to the works cited here, there are many other Han philosophical works written in dialogue, including Huan K'uan's Discussion of Salt and Iron (Yen t'ieh lun); some of the Mawangdui Huang-Lao texts; parts of the Han shih wai chuan, the Li chi, and Huan T'an's Hsin lun; and one of the most interesting chapters in Chia Yi's Hsin shu, the "Tao shu" chapter, the subject of a forthcoming dissertation by Rune Svarverud (Oslo, 1996). 14 - Gary Arbuckle suggests that the essay is less a genre for discussion among equals than the dialogue, as the essay asks for evaluation, and is inherently "less challenging." 15 - See, e.g., LH 83:571. 16 - LH 28:183 is quite clear about the techniques available to the highly trained rhetorician in debate; he may frame his argu- ments in such a way as to be sketchy or provocative, to ask rhe- torical questions, or to leave some information unspoken. LH 83:568, however, criticizes any sophistic language that is plainly "crooked" (i.e., that does not further public morals or benefit the state). 17 - Yang Hsiung probably appreciated the dramatic structure of the dialogue debate because it was essential to the rhapsodic poem (fu), a form of literature that Yang had mastered in his early years. For further information, see David R. Knechtges, The Han Rhap- sody: A Study of the Fu of Yang Hsiung (53 B.C.-A.D. 18) (Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976). 18 - Both the term "gymnastic rhetoric" and its definition are bor- rowed from the classic article by Michael Frede, "Plato's Argu- ments and the Dialogue Form," in Methods of Interpreting Plato and his Dialogues, ed. J. C. Klagge and N. D. Smith (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), pp. 201-219. Frede defines "gymnastic rhetoric" as a game in which the desire to vanquish one's oppo- Philosophy East &amp; West 162</page><page sequence="31">nents on point after point supersedes the desire to make your opponents puzzle out difficult questions about life choices. See below for further information. I argue that while Wang Ch'ung at- tacks some of the peripheral ideas associated with Han Con- fucianism, he fails to offer any substantive refutation of the central ideas associated with classical Confucianism, perhaps because Wang shows a signal lack of understanding for the complex moral issues that underlie Confucian ideology. 19 - I borrow this characterization from Sergey Eisenstein, the Russian movie director, who intentionally juxtaposed a series of images whose relation the audience must discover for itself. 20 - Only a third remains of Ying's original work. For further informa- tion, see Nylan, in ECT, pp. 105-112. 21 - These formulas are used through chap. 2, but not in chaps. 3-5, which concern more contemporary figures. Given the fragmen- tary nature of the extant FSTY it is possible that these opening formulas have dropped out of the received text. But if the cur- rent edition reflects Ying's original text, this suggests that the assessments of more recent figures in the Han were still matters of debate. 22 - By "popular," I refer to beliefs that are widespread, rather than to beliefs held by the lowest-ranking members of society. 23 - Only in chap. 9 of the FSTY a chapter devoted to popular religion, does Ying give equal time to considering the misguided notions of the general populace. 24 - Hsoieh Ch'in, whose personal name was Kung-tsu, was Governor during the reign of Emperor Shun (HHS 83:1745). See also Yen Keng-wang, Liang Han t'ai shou tz'u shih k'ao (Shanghai: Com- mercial Press, 1948), p. 161. I read chi tentatively as "to reach," on the basis of GSR 681 a. Since it is thought that the soul "reaches" the abode of the ancestors after death, chi is used in both the "Kung-yang" commentary and in commentary to the SW as a synonym for "death" and "reaching the ancestors." However, the modern commentator Wu Shu-p'ing assumes that there is a mis- take in the text here. See Feng su t'ung yi chiao shih (Tianjin: People's Publishing, 1980), p. 106 n. 2. 25 - See the Yi li, "Sang fu" chap. The Li chi, "Tsa chi" (A) 20/12 (Legge, 2:140), partially contradicts this statement: "An eldest son, going to wail for his wife did not carry a staff if his parents were alive, nor did he bow so low as to lay his forehead on the ground." Michael Nylan 163</page><page sequence="32">26 - This pun is associated with the "Kung-yang" tradition. This defi- nition was adopted widely by Han scholars, regardless of their supposed chin wen or ku wen affiliations, although the ku wen version of the character for "wife" emphasizes the "worth" rather than the equality of the woman. See, e.g., SW 12B/259A, PHT (Tjan, 261); HHS 82A:2724; TPYL 432; Li chi, "Chiao t'e hsing" 11/25 (corresponding to Legge, 1:439, but Legge reads differently). 27 - The passage on "clarifying the wine" has been slightly modified, so that it conforms with the tale of the exemplary model preserved in Liu Hsiang, Lieh na chuan (SPPY) 2/5a, following Sun Yi-jang, Cha yi (SPPY), 7a-7b. The phrase ch'i-k'uo (here, "eternal con- tract") can also mean "toiling," "distressed," "separated from one another," as in the Mao commentary to Ode 31. However, Karlgren, in Glosses to the Book of Odes (Stockholm: Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1964), p. 113, shows that many Han commentators understood the binome to mean "bound together for life unto death" (based on the SW). For the phrase "cooked food," cf. CYYT 23/37/2 (The I Ching, or Book of Changes, trans. by R. Wilhelm [Princeton, Princeton University, 1950], p. 145): "attend within to the food." I take kuei (GSR 5401) to refer to any present of food offered to ancestors or to parents. 28 - For the phrase "passes down the rule," see Mencius 1 B/14 (trans. by D. C. Lau [Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1970], p. 71). For "suc- ceeding generations," see the Yi li, "Sang fu" chap. 29 - Cf. Ode 155/1 (The Book of Songs, trans. by A. Waley [London: Allen, 1937], p. 235): "such love, such diligent toil." 30 - For the image of the birds, see Li chi, "San nien wen" 38/2 (Legge, 2:392), and Hson tzu, "Li p'ien." For the phrase "fear death and ruin," I follow WSP p. 107 n. 9, in reading kan ("feeling") as wei ("fear," "awe"), on the basis of Ode 164/2 (Book of Songs, p. 203). 31 - These two proverbs are as yet unidentified. 32 - For Ying as legal expert, see Michael Nylan, "Ying Shao's Feng su t'ung yi: An Exploration of Problems in Han Dynasty Political, Philosophical, and Social Unity" (Ph.D. diss., Princeton University, 1982), chaps. 1 (part 1), 2. 33 - FSTY hs(i (p. 3). This preface recalls the words of Liu Hsin and Pan Ku, as recorded in HS 30: 1701. 34 - E.g., in discussing the rampant corruption that plagues the Han- period civil service recommendation system, Ying cites canonical Philosophy East &amp; West 164</page><page sequence="33">references to "shih presented as tribute" (kung-shih) to the Chou throne, without making explicit his comparison between the clas- sical paradigm and the analogous recommendation of hsiao-lien in the Eastern Han. See FSTY4:31. 35 - For Ying's position at court, see chap. 1 of the Nylan dissertation (cited note 32 above). It is tempting to argue that Ying selected the people he criticized on the basis of their stance toward YL*an Shao's proposed "restoration" of Han power, but the historical records do not provide sufficient evidence to make that claim. Note that Ying's FSTY harshly criticizes one member of his patron's family, but there he may mean to criticize members of the Ylan family who wanted nothing to do with Yian Shao's inter- ventionist schemes. 36 - Wang clearly subscribes to the notion that one good test of phi- losophy is its ability to be put into practice. See LH 29:197, where Wang criticizes Han Fei tzu for contradictions between his theory and practice. However, as shown below, the LH itself fails to be consistent in all cases. As to Wang's scorn for the average classicist's antiquarian impulses, it becomes the major theme of entire chapters of the LH (e.g., chaps. 16, 26, 28, 53, 82) and also of selected passages (e.g., LH 84:577). 37 - This is an argument employed by Wang in several chapters, in- cluding LH 57-58, 85. 38 - LH 26:166. This determined refutation of the Nine Tripods tradition probably ties up with Wang's insistence (in LH chaps. 56-60) that the Han dynasty has surpassed its predecessors, for the Han boasted no equally compelling symbol of its political legitimacy. 39 - LH 26:166. 40 - Documents, chap. 1 ("Canon of Yao"), cited in Shang shu t'ung chien, ed. Ku Chieh-kang (Beijing; reprint, 1982), no. 01.0051. 41 - LH 27:175. For further information on the three dominions, see Documents, "YO kung" chapter; on the "barbarian tribes," see Shan hai ching (SPPY) 8/1 a-6b ("Hai-wai pei-ching"). 42 - Wang writes that insofar as even "worthies and sages [can] be deluded by vivid writing," it is pernicious to employ literary figures in speech or in writing (LH 16:85). In LH 85:582-583, Wang says that he has chosen to use the plainest of language for two reasons: (1) that is the only language all but a very few of the literate elite can really understand, and (2) no fancy language is needed for his task. As Wang remarks, one does not always need Michael Nylan 165</page><page sequence="34">a Yi Ya [a legendary cook] to mix up simple foods. Compare Wang's statement on Yi Ya with that of Yang Hsiung cited below. 43 - According to Wang, the widely accepted doctrine of Mutual Sympathy between Heaven and Man is patently a lie, the well- intentioned construct of court scholars who saw in it a way to frighten the ruler into adopting right conduct and sensible policies (LH, chap. 42), even though human beings to some degree share the same ch'i as Heaven. Given the vital importance of human- ity's original, allotment of ch'i, Heaven (sometimes the shorthand for Heaven-and-Earth) inevitably, if unthinkingly, affects human lives profoundly, but humans, occupying a place in the universe roughly analogous to that of lice within a suit of clothing (LH, chaps. 43, 71), can never expect to exert any countervailing in- fluence on Heaven, no matter how talented or highly placed they may be. To imagine that humans might do so is to make Heaven somehow subservient to or dependent on humanity. 44 - Documents, chap. 23 ("Wu ch'eng"), cited in Shang shu t'ung chien, no. 23.0352, describing a battle waged between the founder of the Chou dynasty and the archetypally evil last ruler of Shang. It is possible that Wang's arguments in this passage are meant to support his contention elsewhere that all historical epochs are equal. 45 - For the calling crane, see LH 27: 176; for the pestles floating, LH 27:179. Wang's citation of the Documents passage referring to pestles floating provides a perfect example of his willingness to accept inconsistency for the sake of winning (see below). In LH 25:160, Wang Ch'ung uses as "proof" for one of his arguments this exact same Documents passage that he denounces two chapters later. 46 - In most cases, as Wang insists, the "truth" or "reality" of a sit- uation (shih) is not difficult to ascertain because it concerns factual matters. See note 83 below. When Wang turns to moral matters, however, he concedes that the truth is somewhat more difficult to ascertain. See, e.g., LH 81:560, on the supposed difficulty of really "knowing men" (i.e., ascertaining who is fit for office). Nonetheless, Wang's prose largely fails to separate factual knowl- edge from moral insight, so that his text slides seamlessly from discussions of true and false to those of right and wrong, as in LH 28:182. Wang is loathe to concede that some issues cannot be resolved simply by ascertaining the facts, since they rest on a clash of values or priorities. Wang ultimately is unable, there- fore, to decide whether great worthies, let alone sages, "have few Philosophy East &amp; West 166</page><page sequence="35">namable principles" (LH 80: 542)-a position that comes close to Yang Hsiung's-or whether all aspects of reality can be captured by language. Throughout the LH, Wang fails to separate the Good from the merely practical. (This probably explains Wang's disdain for the Odes and concomitant praise for the Ch'un Ch'iu, which he regards as a repository of practical political ideas. See LH 39:280.) Wang's predilection for rule-making, of course, directly contradicts the writings of Yang Hsiung's remarks on morality, as found in the FY See FY2:5 and 10:28 for Yang's denunciation of the mere imitation of external forms of Goodness and learning, FY 3:9 for Yang's disgust with rote learning, and FY 9:25-26 for Yang's insistence that the "government of the past sages" and the "Way of Confucius" consist not of keeping to a single rule (which would be like "glue"), but of flexible adaptation of certain moral principles to each age. The LH is interesting for the openness with which Wang dis- cusses his view: with regard to rhetorical debate, "It matters not whether a speech be good, but whether its hearers think it so" (LH 1 :3). In LH 14: 71, Wang insists that in court discussions and in lawsuits, he who is mistaken is sure to lose, so long as the person with the facts has developed a winning rhetorical style. Wang clearly assumes, not unlike some lawyers in the American legal system, that the adversarial system is the best vehicle for ascer- taining facts, provided that the combatants have adequate rhetor- ical skills. Wang therefore tends to equate winning an argument with discovery of the Truth. Ultimately, for Wang, knowledge means power (LH 14: 72, 38:271). 47 - Wang shies away from direct attacks on Confucius, arguing merely that the original accounts of Confucius preserved in the Analects, like many passages in the Confucian Classics, have been so badly damaged in transmission as to render them unreliable, unless they are "corrected" in light of the texts of the Hundred Schools phi- losophers. See LH 82:566. That the Classics were "damaged in transmission" (principally under the unspeakably evil Ch'in) was a stock claim made by the officially sanctioned Ju scholastic line- ages (chia) in the late Western and Eastern Han. 48 - For the phrase "no fixed direction," see LH 18:196. Cf. LH 28: 196. 49 - For point no. 1, see LH 28:185. For point no. 2, see LH 28:185, which chastises Confucius for answering a question put to him by the disciple Tzu-kung. Re point no. 3, LH 28:183-184 criticizes Confucius for his failure to issue a clear set of guidelines and pri- orities to his disciples; LH 28:187 criticizes the imprecision of Michael Nylan 167</page><page sequence="36">Confucius' language with regard to fate; LH 28:193 cites the dif- ferent instructions given Tzu-kung and Jan Ch'iu regarding the proper administration of the state; LH 28: 196 criticizes Confucius for acting quite differently when faced with the two similar cases of Yang Huo and Kung-shan Fu-jao. Cf. Wang's complaints in LH 67 :463. For the phrase "later generations have been left in doubt," see LH 28:194. With point no. 4, Wang criticizes Confucius' de- cision to compare his lazy disciple Ts'ai Wo to rotten wood and dung; see LH 28:185-187. For point no. 5, see LH 28:188. Wang's argument goes like this: only vulgar people swear oaths (Wang conveniently ignores the evidence that many great figures in Chinese history reportedly swore oaths); therefore, Confucius should not have sworn an oath under any circumstances. For point no. 6, see LH 28:187, criticizing Confucius' comments on fate; LH 28:189, criticizing Confucius' reported comments for "not paying attention to what is basic and looking to what is sec- ondary"; LH 28:196, criticizing Confucius' self-pitying talk for having no moral motivation. For point no. 7, see LH 67:463-464. In the LH, Confucius is not infrequently accused of "having no way by which to ascertain the truth" (e.g., in LH 67:461). 50 - Wang's assumption that the sages must be consistent probably derives from his belief that Heaven (seen not only as the model followed by the sages, but also as the source of a higher pro- portion of their constituent ch'i) cannot issue contradictory com- mands. See LH 12:61 and LH 54:364 for the claims that the sages have a higher proportion of Heavenly ch'i than ordinary men. Then see LH 17:95, 23:138, 42:298-299, and 46:322 for the analogy between heaven and sagely government. This anal- ogy becomes the basis for many other arguments in the LH. E.g., it is because Heaven is consistent that the virtuous ruler will not on impulse show clemency simply to curry favor with his people (LH 45:314). In a very few LH passages (e.g., LH 76:508), however, Wang demonstrates his awareness of the real limitations of this analogy between Heaven and man. Interestingly enough, when Wang wishes to dispute certain ideas, he uses as "proof" the supposed existence of an extremely strict hierarchy in the Golden Ages of the past. See, e.g., LH 27:178 for Wang on the reign of Yao. In two additional anec- dotes recorded in another chapter, Wang's "proof" consists of the fact that those in high position could not possibly have con- descended to those below them; no high ministers would have consulted with shih who live in humble lanes, nor would sage- kings ever have consented to live in humble surroundings (both in Philosophy East &amp; West 168</page><page sequence="37">LH 25:163). A final "sign" of Wang's essential conservatism lies in Wang's own "proof" that sage-rulers are not fathered by the gods: Wang insists that the circumstances leading to such births would be undignified for those of present or future high rank; hence, they simply cannot ever have happened; see LH 83:569- 570. Wang often writes of the extreme dangers of employing liter- ary figures of speech or in writing (LH 16:85; cf. Aristotle arguing against metaphorical writing). Nonetheless, Wang does not hesi- tate to employ standard literary figures of speech when they will further his own rhetorical arguments. See, e.g., LH 39:282, which compares writing to plants, birds, archery contests, and various techne. Wang seems almost to resent the fact that composing moving works of art does not always require great factual knowl- edge (LH 39:283). Wang's search (even if it is intermittent) for a single fixed standard of language is somewhat reminiscent of the Mohist Logicians, but there is a crucial difference: while the Logicians wanted to amend the language so that "every different reality should be expressed by a different word," Wang Ch'ung tends to ignore differences in the real world in order to describe different entities by the same word, so long as this aids his argu- ments by analogy. Rather than allow for the possibility of a pro- liferation of "names," then, Wang would reduce vocabulary to an absolute minimum, given his distrust of flowery language. Wang's writings on language feel like a reductio ad absurdum of the "Rectification of Names" proposition, in which the theorist as- sumes that people can be made good by the force of names cor- rected by authority. Wang would return people to a unified stan- dard of behavior by enforcing a unified standard of language on them. Wang, then, directly contradicts Yang Hsiung in his under- standing of language. See below for further information. 51 - LH chap. 30 is devoted to a critique of Mencius. Although Wang Ch'ung accuses Confucius of occasional lapses unworthy of the noble man, Wang accuses Mencius of downright disingenuous- ness and intentional harm; see LH 30:208. Wang rails so often against poetic figures of speech and convoluted prose that to be absolutely consistent he would crudely have to label as "liars" most authors, especially the moralists, working in the classical tra- dition (e.g., LH 20:199, 81:560, 84:575). Put this way, Wang's notion of the relation between language and reality directly con- tradicts that of Yang Hsiung, who believes that all truly great en- tities can be given only partial descriptions, with the result that they must be intuited, rather than logically "known"; see FY 8:23, Michael Nylan 169</page><page sequence="38">for Yang's insistence that the Confucian Way is not reducible to easy formulas. Still, to be fair, Wang's concern is that certain tra- ditions, if misunderstood, can lead people to make erroneous judgments about their lives; the primary function of the lun ("to discuss," "to dispute") tradition, as opposed to works that tso ("create") or shu ("transmit"), was to alert readers to such dangers (LH 84:576). In LH chap. 17, a popular anecdote about Duke Ching of Sung is said to lead people to the erroneous conclusion that virtuous conduct is always rewarded with conventional material success. 52 - All these teaching techniques Wang crudely reduces to "lies" (hsi) in LH 28:190. (Contrast the very different assessment in Yang Hsiung's FY where Confucius' "bending" is not seen as "disreputable" [FY 8:22]). Several chapters in the LH, including chaps. 26-27, seek to expose the commonplace "exaggerations" (tseng) used by the Ju in teaching (e.g., LH 27: 179). LH 27: 176, e.g., chides even the "men of the Odes" (i.e., the ancient poets) for "wanting to use an analogy for [current] events." Despite Wang's sharp criticism of the Ju for their propensity to exaggerate, Wang himself is prone to exaggeration when he wishes to make a point. In one passage, e.g., Wang describes Confucius as one whose "body knew no rest ... and whose bones jutted out of the surrounding flesh" (LH 25:158). Finally, Wang faults the Ju for using too many absolutes in their writing (LH 26:169, 25:159, 27:178, 27:176), but Wang himself says of Duke Huan of Ch'i, "To a man, none dared to disobey [him]" (LH 16:87). 53 - LH 38:272-274, e.g., talks of the work of the Ju in terms of the pursuit of knowledge, not of moral learning, so that "the deeper one goes" into "the sages' house" (a stock metaphor for Con- fucian learning), the more facts one acquires. Note that this defi- nition of Goodness is not at war with Wang's equation elsewhere of Goodness with consistency, since Wang believes in a unitary truth attainable through rhetorical debate. 54 - LH 28:181, which discounts the reputation of certain worthies and sages on the grounds that "they did not know how to level objections and frame questions" (pu chih nan wen). Wang Ch'ung assumes that arguments can be refined through continual chal- lenges (LH 28:181-182). That explains why, according to Wang, "The Han established the office of Academician (po shih) so that master and disciple would level objections to one another['s the- ories], in the hopes of plumbing the depths of the Way, and giving form to the innate patterns of right and wrong" (LH 45:318). LH v Al Philosophy East &amp; West Philosophy East &amp; West 170</page><page sequence="39">84:574 similarly states that the Han rulers established the offices at Lan-t'ai in order to "collate and examine its texts, so as to test their words." LH chap. 36 has Wang himself posing a number of pointed questions to self-proclaimed authorities, including the classical scholars and law clerks at court. In LH chaps. 28 and 30, Wang assumes the role of ideal disciple (by his own terms) to Confucius and Mencius, in that he challenges those sages to ac- count for their inconsistencies. Finally, in the concluding chapters of the LH, Wang characterizes the "true" Ju in the following manner: "The Confucian masters in perfecting the sayings of their former teachers asked questions of them and leveled objections against them" (LH 84:576). 55 - LH 28:195. Cf. the argument in LH chap. 47, where Huan T'an (early first century A.D.) is praised for having stumped Liu Hsin (d. A.D. 23). Wang's putative opponents among the literati are con- tent, he says, to conclude from this that certain processes "are in- capable of being verified according to the processes and patterns of nature." Wang disagrees. Wang believes that Liu Hsin was an "inferior" scholar if "he could not reply" to Huan T'an's objec- tions, implying that all matters are ultimately verifiable, given suf- ficiently precise language. 56 - Confucius, Mencius, and HsOn tzu argued that the best guide to moral action is close observation of the good person's moral ex- ample, followed by faithful (if creative) adaptation of that example in one's own actions. In contrast, the LH everywhere reveals Wang's desire to devise absolute rules. A good example is found in LH 80:543, where Wang considers the cases of three sages (Ch'U Po-yG, King Wen of Chou, and Confucius) who were im- prisoned or endangered. The reader is given a choice: either she must assume that all these men deserved to be punished, or she must assume that none of these men did anything to merit the harsh punishments he received. Wang concludes from this that the virtuous life can in no instance save a person from a cruel fate: "that no one can by himself [i.e., by his conduct] avoid it." The operation of fate, in other words, is seen as a monolithic force that human beings are powerless to resist, rather than (a) a human construction used to explain a variety of factors or (b) one of many factors operating to influence human life. 57 - LH 30:207. Wang's chapters on the Confucian masters are peppered with rhetorical questions like "Was [Confucius] saying that the Way of a gentleman makes allowances for itself?" (LH 28:190). Wang also states, "I have never yet understood what was the idea behind Confucius' making ritual" (LH 28:192). Michael Nylan 171</page><page sequence="40">58 - This is the main argument of LH chap. 82: "The great man's vir- tue is vast; his writings, brilliant. The petty man's virtue is to blaze up [in spurts]; his writing will be patchy." Cf. LH 61:412, which criticizes the philosophers of the Chou-Ch'in transitional period for their selfishness and inconsistency. 59 - LH 82:561. 60 - Wang's failure to allow exceptions to the rule means that many of Wang's refutations seem to require a single cause for a certain effect under all circumstances. A good example is found in LH chap. 47, which criticizes the rain-making practices of Tung Chung-shu. The chapter's various "proofs" represent minor varia- tions on two main assertions: first, if any one depiction of a dragon could not summon rain, no depiction under any circumstances could summon rain. Wang says, e.g., of the Lord of Yeh, "He had dragons painted on all his walls, his basins, and his pots. Surely if types of objects depicting [dragons] acted like the real thing, then the state of Yeh would always have had rain." Second, if there were ever a time that a dragon's appearance did not summon rain, then the dragon's appearance at no time could summon rain. Cf. LH chaps. 48-49, which argue that if one instance of calamity due to tigers or insects is attributable to human agency, then all calamities of the same category ought to happen continually on account of the same agency. In Wang's own mind, Wang himself is among the most worthy of men because he knows how to de- vise clear rules (see LH chaps. 84-85). Hence the remarks in LH 80:547, which claim that it is easier for someone like Wang to recognize worthies than it is for the average workman to make tools. Wang's strictures on language may be chiefly designed to support his strict ranking of men, wherein people just like Wang are to be awarded the top rank of shih, second only to the emperor. 61 - LH 28:188-189. Cf. LH 30:188, speaking of Confucius' inter- view with Nan tzu. Similarly, the argument in LH 16:79-80 also assumes that ritual forbids direct interaction between a nobleman (or "noble man") and a commoner. 62 - LH 16:79, speaking of Yen-ling Chi tzu. Especially when speak- ing of sages or kings, Wang is clearly more comfortable with blanket statements and inflexible definitions (often of the most conventional sort) than with the consideration of moral dilemmas required for ethical choice. E.g., he writes in LH 51 :353 (Forke, 2:313), "Those kings take the whole world as their family." Wang's moral inflexibility may be a natural response to his per- sonal disappointments (see below). Philosophy East &amp; West 172</page><page sequence="41">63 - For the quotation, see LH 16:80; this is a stock Ju claim (found, e.g., in Hsoin tzu's justification for studying the later kings) that Wang has taken to an absurd length. For Wang's arguments on ch'i, see LH chaps. 53 and 56. However, Wang repeats his asser- tion regarding the general equality of all ages in many other sec- tions (e.g., in LH 29:202). For Wang's propensity to try to em- phasize sameness, rather than difference, see Wang's statements in LH 17:93, where he insists that good deeds and good words, since they issue from a single source, are "both of one ch'i; they are no different"; and LH 17:95, which says, "Heaven and man share the same Way; what they love or hate does not differ...." 64 - E.g., Shun's dynastic rule, Wang Ch'ung argues, would have been an exact imitation of the rule of his predecessor, YUi (LH 16:81). And the virtues of Y0i and Shun "could not surpass" that of Yao, Wang insists (LH 16:82). In LH 57:390, Wang even asserts that all ages ought to produce the same number of sages, since sages are produced by a spontaneous endowment of ch'i from Heaven. Wang often depends on this line of argumentation presuppos- ing absolute consistency. Regarding bad rulers, he writes in LH 25:158, "If Chieh and Chou shared the same conduct, then they ought to have contracted the same illness" (a clear misuse of a single similarity to explain an unrelated phenomenon). In LH 16:88, Wang also states that "There are no immoral rulers who can employ worthies [as advisors]." Once again, Wang's basic argument there is that the evil of one political ruler must equal that of another evil ruler. Regarding the nonhuman realm, Wang seeks to prove in chap. 47 that the "intelligence of clouds and rain cannot exceed that of fish," and so on. 65 - LH 16:83. 66 - See LH 28:187 for its discussion of expressions used of fate. Un- like the Logicians (ming-chia) of the Warring States period, Wang seems to mistake "names" belonging only to the world of lan- guage for realities operating in the world of fact, thereby erasing the innumerable degrees of sameness and difference that exist in Heaven-and-Earth. 67 - Wang's biography reports that Wang had what we would now call a "photographic memory," such that Wang could memorize books for sale in the marketplace after a single glance; see HHS 49 : 1629. 68 - The characterization of Wang's philosophy comes from Fung Yu- lan, A History of Chinese Philosophy, trans. Derk Bodde (Prince- ton: Princeton University Press, 1973), 2:151. Michael Nylan 173</page><page sequence="42">69 - Many of Wang's arguments in the LH make little sense unless we accept Wang's idea that winning rhetorical arguments is the final and most obvious test of the worthy or sage (see note 46 above). Probably this idea was shared by Wang's contemporaries, as most of Wang's other views seem to have been. After all, Han-period court debates on classical learning rated the correctness of certain doctrinal theories according to the rhetorical abilities of the clas- sical scholars who held such ideas, rhetorical abilities that were established through Wang's preferred method of "question and challenge" (wen nan). It is thus no accident that Wang's views were widely accepted in the late Eastern Han and Wei-Chin peri- ods, when ch'ing-t'an masters were widely admired. It is entirely suitable, rather, that Wang's fame chiefly derives from Ts'ai Yung's use of the LH as a promptbook for early ch'ing-t'an debates; see HHS 49:1629 n. 1, citing Y~ian Shan-sung's history. For a good summary of ch'ing-t'an, see Tang Yiming, "The Voices of Wei-Jin Scholars: A Study of 'Qingtan' " (Ph.D diss., Columbia University, 1991). 70 - LH 83:569-570 shows Wang equating "the principle of revering the honorable" (tsun kuei chih chieh) with right conduct. Anne Cheng, in her excellent work on Ho Hsiu (Etude sur le Con- fucianism Han [Paris: M6moires de 'l'nstitut des Hautes Etudes Chinoises, 1985]), has identified a trend of moral absolutism in Eastern Han associated 'with proponents of the Tso chuan, in op- position to the Kung-yang proponents' advocacy of "adaptation to circumstances," which tends (in the words of Gary Arbuckle) to specialize in arranging hierarchies of value. Wang Ch'ung clearly identifies himself as a proponent of the Tso in several passages in the LH, including LH 83:567-568, where he praises the Tso tra- dition as the "only one to approach the facts." 71 - Wang offers no critique of Han institutions, only the suggestion that political elites (at both the imperial and local levels) employ men like Wang more often in office. E.g., LH 61 :411 repeats the standard argument that the Han has legitimacy only insofar as it institutes the system that Confucius laid out for it in the Ch'un Ch'iu. LH 16:87-89 argues that a political leader of high rank (in this case, Duke Huan of Ch'i) could not perform acts of great im- morality and still maintain his authority-and this despite a host of other chapters (including chap. 1) that insist that an individual's political success and his personal morality are entirely unrelated. For one instance of Wang's quibbles with his fellow classi- cists, see Wang's assessment of Wu Chtin-kao in LH 16:81 and 83:572. While the first passage mocks Wu for his errors, the sec- Philosophy East &amp; West 174</page><page sequence="43">ond praises Wu as a "wisdom bag" of unusual talent, whose merit has not been appreciated sufficiently. Unfortunately, Wang's blend of envy mixed with cringing obsequiousness toward those in power makes it unlikely that today's historians will be able to tie the composition of parts of the LH to particular historical circum- stances or to identify the specific targets of Wang's enmity. 72 - After all, to the degree that the conjunction of various forms of ch'i mandates human conduct (see below), it also undermines the utility of moral action and the possibility of free will. And conduct is fated, rather than chosen, as is shown by the "facts" that Wang cites: "Rich merchants are bound to snatch away the property of poor families" and sages are produced by "harmonious ch'i." See LH 10:50-51 and 51:351. 73- LH 16:86 and 17:93. 74 - In LH 16-17, Wang insists that good conduct can never in any way increase a person's chances of good fortune. Here Wang Ch'ung directly contradicts the sense of several Analects passages, which suggest that good conduct gives one a statistically better chance of having a successful life, at least under the rule of an equitable government. Wang also contradicts Yang Hsiung (see below). For Wang's insistence that all eras are the same, see, e.g., LH 26:167, which argues that the "the ancients truly are equal to men of today." Similarly, LH 27 : 176 argues that "those commoners of Chou were like present-day commoners." Cf. LH 57:390, which remarks that only "the vulgar like to praise the distant past and extol antiquity"; and LH 83:571, which says, "Now vulgar men like to regard antiquity as precious, but they do not honor the present. They say that the present writings are not as good as the ancient books. Now antiquity and the present are one and the same." LH 28:181 basically repeats this idea, but there Wang contradicts himself immediately in the very next passage, arguing that the achievements of the Han not only equal those of Chou, but surpass them. Note the difference between HsOn tzu's state- ment that past and present are one and the same with regard to guiding principles, and Wang Ch'ung's contention that past and present are one and the same with regard to specifics. 75 - It is significant that Wang thinks of worthy Ju in office as little dif- ferent from law clerks, except that they are better read (see LH 29:197, 202; 34:245ff.; 38:272; 84:576-577). According to Wang, only "worthy scholars" (i.e., those who cannot be stymied in public disputations) know how to use the rites to inculcate in Michael Nylan 175</page><page sequence="44">the common people the deference and loyalty to superiors that preserves the state and reduces crimes; the harsh punishments advocated by the Legalists represent merely a supplementary tool of good government. 76 - LH 83:571. In the same passage, Wang particularly praises texts that preserve the form of debates, like Huan K'uan's Discussion of Salt and Iron. Also, he displays his impatience with the scholarly "out" of simply transcribing two or more contradictory traditions, without choosing between them, since "there is nothing that can- not be known in either speech or writing." Wang is anything but a skeptic, then. 77 - The last five chapters of the LH make it abundantly clear that Wang hopes that his text will win him the fame (and possibly the fortune) that he deserves, given his vast erudition and exceptional loyalty to the Han ruling house. In one typical passage there, Wang defines the task of "worthies in the world" in terms of his own work on the LH: "When they advance [in official careers], in a completely loyal fashion they propagate moral transformation, so as to make the court illustrious. And if they are in retirement, they weigh discussions and refute theories, in order to awaken [the world] to mistaken customs." Wang then states quite plainly that this is his task in the LH (LH 84:575). Wang could also be sketching a self-portrait when he praises, in LH 82:562, the "literary classicists" (wen Ju) whose writings will be transmitted down through the ages, though they have no clients and they are seldom rewarded with government posts. LH 82:565 insists coyly that the writers in Wang's era are every bit as talented as those of long ago. LH 82 :566 admits the present government's faults, and then remarks that only those far from the capital (i.e., those like Wang) can really understand their solution. But the entire LH supplies evidence that Wang thinks himself a genius of the highest order, deserving of fame and fortune. E.g., in LH 61:411-413, Wang Ch'ung argues the special value of original treatises and published theories like the LH, as opposed to memorials, official records, literary works, and (commentaries to?) the Five Classics and the Warring States philosophers; Wang there reserves his highest praise for those who wield "the power of the pen used to greatest effect to ascertain the truth of good and evil"-in other words, for men like himself. Earlier chapters com- pare the LH successively to each of the Confucian Classics, and also to what Wang terms later "classics" (works like Yang Hsiung's T'ai hsOan ching and Huan T'an's Hsin lun). See, e.g., LH 61 :413, and LH 84:578, which compares the LH with the Odes; LH Philosophy East &amp; West 176</page><page sequence="45">84:576, which compares the LH to the Yi ching; and LH 16: 87, which compares Wang's work with the Ch'un Ch'iu, in that both "take up [for praise] the very smallest praiseworthy act, while condemning the smallest act of depravity," and all without the undue embellishments common to ordinary conversations. Wang even likens himself to Confucius in LH 85 :589. 78 - As is typical of "gymnastic rhetoricians" (a term borrowed from Michael Frede), Wang in his desire to win against opponents feels no need to be equally committed to each and every one of his statements-a curious fact, given Wang's persistent equation of consistency and sage wisdom when he is less defensive in argu- ments. Wang's main goal seems to be to construct a "winning" (i.e., persuasive) argument from any type of evidence assumed to be pertinent to the subject at hand. Internal inconsistencies abound in the Lun heng, the most important of which concerns the degree of control that the indi- vidual exercises over his fate (see below). There are a host of minor contradictions as well. E.g., the entire chap. 53 of LH disputes the notion that Heaven has conscious intentions, but LH 61:411 talks of Heaven's dislike for the Ch'in for "destroying its literary com- positions" and its consequent support for Liu Pang, founder of the Han. Turning to LH 47, Wang disputes the idea that the Chou tripods have inherent divine powers, while proofs in another chapter (LH 57) rest upon those same Chou tripods having divine powers. LH 24: 146 characterizes the sages as ones who "belabor their feelings and agonize in their thoughts," while Wang insists in LH 25 and 30 that the true sage always feels equanimity in the face of the world's troubles. Wang is equally inconsistent in his use of classical authorities as "proof" for his arguments. The main theme of LH 28 is that Confucius was no sage whose words may be trusted, but most LH chapters cite Confucius as final authority (e.g., LH 80:538); indeed, when Wang wants to praise Confucius, then he cites him as one who keeps strictly to the truth, eschewing all exaggeration (LH 27:179-180). Similarly, Yang Hsiung's writ- ings are usually cited as authoritative in Wang's writings (e.g., LH 83:570), yet LH 80:546 has harsh words for Yang's ability to "apportion true and false or analyze the true facts behind right and wrong." Such contradictions are partly attributable to Wang's need to win his audience's confidence by appealing to their preconceptions. 79 - The phrase comes from the Chuang tzu. See A. C. Graham, trans., Chuang tzu: The Inner Chapters (London: Unwin, 1981), pp. 106- 107. I am indebted to Gary Arbuckle for this citation. HHS Michael Nylan 177</page><page sequence="46">49:1629 may refer to Wang's "arguing from a lodging place" when it comments, "At the beginning [his theories] seemed strange, though in the end there was good order and truth [in them]." To give one instance of Wang's arguing "from a lodging place": in a chapter titled "Publicizing the Han," Wang assumes the position of a "true" believer in ominous signs from Heaven to show that even from the standpoint of the believer in omens and prodigies, the achievements of the Han dynasty far surpass those of all other dynasties, including the Chou. One of Wang's main points in the LH, however, is that ominous portents signify nothing other than a certain conjunction of patterned ch'i. 80 - For one example of Wang's "arguing from a lodging place," Wang in chap. 54 argues two quite different suppositions advanced by his contemporaries: that Heaven is best treated as ch'i and that it is best treated as a physical body (t'i). Wang demonstrates that neither analogy will support the doctrine of T'ien-jen kan-ying. 81 - Numerous chapters of the LH (chaps. 1-7, 9-12, 20-21, 42-43, 53-55) make the case that human events result simply from the spontaneous interaction between cycles of Yin/Yang and the Five Phases; there Wang explicitly seeks to refute the popular tradition that virtuous men can cause an anthropomorphic Heaven to in- terfere with the natural course of events. However, LH chaps. 8 and 13, devoted to the effect of education upon human nature, accept the prevailing view that one may "get ahead" in the world, regardless of one's original endowment of ch'i, if there is sufficient dedication to learning. 82 - This is the main thrust of LH 80, "Ascertaining the Worthy," but this theme also runs strong throughout the entire LH, beginning with its opening lines, which complain, "Even if one's conduct and principles exhibit consistent worth, one may fail to achieve consistent success when serving in office." Cf. LH 40:287, which bemoans the fact that even "worthy Ju ... do not advance in their careers"; LH 80: 541, which insists that something akin to the blowing of ch'i determines whether one attains or holds high office; and LH 85:581, which baldly states that Wang's failure to be accorded high office is due to a bad fate. Although Wang claims not to care that he has failed in his career, his failure ob- viously rankles, for Wang repeatedly blames those authorities who cannot tell that his work is an absolute gem, like "jade or pearls" (LH 85:584). Why, then, does Wang bother to write the LH? As he himself tells us, the man of real worth must show himself ready to contribute to the empire, in case the specific configurations of ch'i change enough to permit even the vulgar to recognize his Philosophy East &amp; West 178</page><page sequence="47">excellence (LH 1:4). In other words, he loses nothing by trying to gain the recognition of the court. 83 - See note 46 above. Wang insists that "There is nothing that can- not be known, with regard to either talk or writing" (LH 83:571). To Wang, the "Way of Heaven is not obscure" (LH 17:93). So long as one is careful to marshal all available evidence, "the evi- dence will arrange itself, and the facts of true and false will have their determination" (LH 25:159). In a similar vein, LH 16:79 insists that "Truth, though obscured, can still be known, and facts, though hidden, can still be ascertained. In plain prose and ex- posed writing, true and false are easily seen." For this reason, Wang Ch'ung insists, only "vulgar men among his contemporaries cannot ascertain" the egregious lies put about (LH 16:91). 84 - Wang's brief biography in the HHS sees Wang's angry love of contention as the chief cause of his failure to climb the ranks of the Han bureaucracy. HHS 49:1629 says of Wang: "He served the commandery as Bureau of Merit officer, but on account of re- peated remonstrances and fights, in which Wang disagreed [with his superior's ideas], he was let go." The tone of the LH corrobo- rates this account. LH 84:575 states, e.g., that local officials who claim to be authorities have broadcast such pernicious lies that Wang is unable to keep his mouth shut about them. At the same time, curiously enough, Wang openly offers himself as chief pan- egyrist for the Han dynasty (LH 60:407-408), in hopes that the court will raise him far above those jealous local officials who have slandered him. 85 - This is the basic argument in LH 84-85. Cf. the defensive tone of LH 57:390, where Wang insists that his extravagant praise of the Han "is not because I myself live in the age of the Han and pile adulation on [anything] praiseworthy in a quest for flattering references." 86 - I take the brevity of Wang's biography as one rough measure of the relatively low status accorded his works. In the present edition of the HHS (Chung-hua Shu-chLi edition), Wang's biography oc- cupies only one page of text (HHS 49:1629-1630), as compared with the two long chapters accorded "master" Yang Hsiung. For corroborating accounts of Wang's place in Chinese intellectual history, see Ts'ai Yung's (132-192) biography, which shows three important facts: (1) that Ts'ai Yung lifted certain arguments from the LH to enhance his skills in court debate, (2) that even Ts'ai Yung gave the LH a lukewarm assessment (HHS 79B :2575), and (3) that Wang's book was largely unknown a century after his Michael Nylan 179</page><page sequence="48">death. Cf. YiJan Shan-sung's book, cited in notes to HHS49:1629, which calls the LH a "secret plaything" (mi wan) for "help in debate" (t'an chu); Ko Hung's Pao p'u tzu A/1lb2 (Sun Hsing- yen's edition). Deliberately dismissive of the traditional assess- ments of Wang's work, most intellectual historians of the twentieth century have seen the LH as a "skeptical" work of great origi- nality. Some would see Wang's admirable insistence that lan- guage be verified by investigation (LH 83 :568) as unique for his time, but Huan T'an's Hsin lun, quoted in TPYL 2/6b-7a (Pokora, pp. 116-117), suggests that this urge to verify was usual among some, if not all, Han Ju. 87 - That contentious debates were widely regarded as "good form" in scholastic debates is proven by HHS 35:1208, which seems to argue that vigorous debate improved learning. Cf. Hou Han chi (BSS) 22:264. Yang Hsiung, however, believed that it was not possible to change people's behavior by mere phrase-making (FY 3:7). 88 - In LH 84:577, Wang correctly presents the LH as less of an in- novation than Yang Hsiung's T'ai hsian ching. LH 28:183, in fact, acknowledges the need for the good rhetorician to adjust both the content and form of his arguments to the preconceptions of his audience. Wang generally relies on standard analogies (often based in poetry) to convince his readers of his rhetorical points. See, e.g., LH 27: 1 77, which compares rich people in a famine to lush mountain forests in a drought; and LH 26:165, which com- pares the relation between the penal code and the army to the relation between feet and wings. Wang also does not hesitate to use outlandish legends as "proofs," so long as they can be made to support his argument. E.g., one of Wang's "proofs" in favor of Tung Chung-shu's method of attracting rain cites the story of one Li Tzu-chang, an unidentified jurist whose court decisions de- pended upon a wooden figurine whose movements indicated the guilt or innocence of the accused; see LH 47 : 328-329. And when Wang wants to emphasize the transforming power of a good ed- ucation, he cites the legend saying that at the time of Yao and Shun, all were worthy and enfeoffed (LH 8:34), though that is the very same legend that he disputes in another chapter criticizing exaggerations in classical traditions (LH 27: 178). 89 - At the heart of the Confucian Way lies the famous double paradox (natural/artificial, human/divine): that the absolute realization of human potential through total dedication to the arduous process of self-cultivation results in the acquisition of a virtual second nature that is godlike in its powers. Wang's failure to discriminate Philosophy East &amp; West 180</page><page sequence="49">fact from moral value should not be taken as a sign that Han thinkers were far too unsophisticated to make such discrimina- tions. A century before Wang Ch'ung, Yang Hsiung brilliantly dis- tinguished both factual knowledge and practical utility from moral insight. See FY 5:14 and FY 6:16, both of which dispute the popular assumption that those who "know every little thing" are (1) orthodox followers of Confucius and (2) deserving of emulation or admiration. In contrast to Wang, who celebrates factual knowl- edge (e.g., in LH 36), Yang regards the acquisition of mere facts as relatively unimportant, giving far greater weight to devotion to the Good. For this reason, I suspect that Yang Hsiung, had he known Wang Ch'ung, would have considered Wang to be one of those "petty men" who fail to distinguish between what is important and unimportant (FY 8:23). Yang would also have criticized Wang as one who "loved books, but did not find the essential [model] for them in Confucius; loved theories, but did not find the essential [model] for them in Confucius" (FY 2: 6). As Yang sees little merit in questioning per se (FY3 :9), he is quite critical of the rhetoricians (FY 6: 18). Wang intends to prove that virtue (principally defined as fac- tual knowledge) goes unrewarded, whereas Yang Hsiung cele- brates virtue as its own reward. Also, Yang Hsiung would not go as far as Wang to discount the effect of individual conduct upon the quality of one's life; hence, the very different assessments of Hsiang YUi found in FY 10:29 and LH 6:23-24, and also, re- garding the effect of astrological changes upon one's life, in FY 8:23 and LH 6:24. In addition, Yang is intent upon demonstrat- ing that subtle benefits (which are psychological and aesthetic in nature, rather than material) accrue from faithful adherence to true Confucian doctrine. One thing that Wang Ch'ung shares in common with philo- sophical masters like Yang Hsiung is, however, the need to defend himself against charges that he has "created" (tso) innovative new works. In LH 84:574, Wang suggests that his words may even be regarded as treasonous, since those in power have so little real understanding. 90 - FY 10 :31. Besides, according to Yang Hsiung, fine phrase-making cannot persuade people to be good; only a good example can do that (FY 3 : 12). 91 - See note 86 above. 92 - As with Plato, it is not always clear which point of view Yang en- dorses; the arguments may be inconclusive or even fallacious, or they may rest on assumptions that we think a good thinker would Michael Nylan 181</page><page sequence="50">reject. Like Plato, Yang Hsiung chooses to write, in other words, in such a way that it is not always clear from the very form of his writing whether he endorses a specific argument or not. We have to look for clues by giving careful consideration to one or more dialogues. With Yang Hsiung's dialogues, there is always room for questions, precisely because they are not treatises on facts, in the manner of Wang Ch'ung, but considerations of the all-important topic of moral choice. 93 - As the didactic dialectic is one where the questioner assuredly already has the answer, the answers could as well be explained in continuous speech, even in successive formulas, just like those that mathematicians use to present proofs. 94 - In Yang's kind of dialogue, as in the Platonic dialogues, it is ab- solutely crucial "that one arrive at the right view by one's own thought, rather than on the authority of somebody else" (Frede, "Plato's Arguments," p. 21 7); otherwise, one cannot be brought to commit to the true Confucian Way. FY 3:7 remarks on the im- possibility of ever forcing someone who is unconvinced to adhere to the Confucian Way. Yang's dialogues, like those of Plato, are "aporetic" or "elenctic," in that the questioner is gradually led to see the ignorance out of which he has postulated some claim. 95 - It is quite usual for Warring States and Han thinkers to apply the language of curing and healing to the discussion of Moral Teach- ing (chiao). See, e.g., LH 80:540; THC 15/app. 7; Yen t'ieh lun, ed. Wang Li-ch'i, p. 369. I am here indebted to Martha Nuss- baum's Introduction to The Therapy of Desire: Theory and Practice in Hellenistic Ethics (Princeton: Princeton University, 1994). One passage in Yang's FY hints that his own composing of the dialogue is in part a therapeutic exercise undertaken in response to the death of his beloved son. 96 - See Knechtges, The Han Rhapsody, chap. 5. 97 - FY 3 :7. Some other philosophical schools are said, in contrast to Confucianism, to represent the "extreme of inhumanity"; see FY 4:12. 98 - Frede, "Plato's Arguments," p. 215. 99 - My interpretation follows the main commentary by Li Kuei. Still, the same passage could be taken to refer to the Analects passage (3/24) where a frontier guard remarks that "Heaven intends to use your master [Confucius] as a wooden bell," which will alert the masses (to their wrongdoing). See Cheng HsUan's note to the Chou li, "T'ien kuan," "Hsiao chai" section. Philosophy East &amp; West 182</page><page sequence="51">100 - This, of course, refers the learned student to the many Analects passages that debate the merits of substance and refinement (e.g., 6/18). 101 - Yang sketches that process in his opening remarks in FY 1:1: "Study [of the Ancients] is used to regulate it [human nature]. Thought is used to refine it. Friends are used to polish it. [Aspira- tions] for a [fine] reputation are used to elevate it. Untiring efforts are used to complete it. This is the sum total of what should be called 'love of learning' [i.e., studying others so that one becomes a suitable object of emulation to others]." For Yang's impatience with rote imitation and rule-making, see FY 3:9 and 9:25-26. For Yang's belief that Confucius himself is not a complete master of every single factual detail, see FY 5:13 and 5:14. In FY 6:16, Yang specifically refutes the idea that the best teacher is he who has the greatest command of factual details. 102 - Yang's decision to emphasize the human potential for aesthetic appreciation, rather than government service, in seeking the es- sential core of Confucianism tallies with some, though not all, of Robert Eno's characterizations of early Confucian practice in The Confucian Creation of Heaven: Philosophy and the Defense of Ritual Mastery (Albany: SUNY Press, 1990). 103 - E.g., FY 1:3-4 insists that Yen Hui's pleasure in attempting to imitate Confucius was both exquisite, unvarying, and "immea- surable." However, let me not overdo the comparison with the Chuang tzu: the (late and systematizing) "Supreme Happiness" chapter explicitly dismisses as fruitless the anguish that we feel in the face of greatness, while Yang Hsiung regards this anguish as highly salutary. 104 - Hence, the comparison in FY 2:5 between the sex appeal of beautiful women and the "appeal" (to be used for good or ill) of books. 105 - It is no accident that the FSTY stresses, rather than downplays, the highly charged emotional drama that is human life. Yang intends to provoke the human emotions in such a way as to incite their need to search for true human greatness. Therefore, something very like stage directions are supplied for the FY dialogues. In FY 1 : 1-2, e.g., we are told that the questioner is "greatly startled"; FY 1:2 shows the questioner laughing in embarrassment; FY 7:21, a passage on Ch'in, is said to drip with sarcasm, according to the notes, and so on through the dialogue. 106 - See, e.g., the argument in FY 2:6, which suggests (by an implied comparison with clothing) that it is not how many goods we ac- Michael Nylan 183</page><page sequence="52">quire in our life, but whether those goods are suitable to our needs in life. According to Yang, only Goodness itself can suit all our needs in everyday life. 107 - For the best expression of the sage who is "untroubled" because he accepts what he cannot change, see FY 3:7, which recalls the "Great Commentary" to the Changes. Cf. FY 1 :1, where Yang disconnects "love of learning" from the pursuit of longevity; and FY 5:14, where Yang rebuts the conventional notion that Con- fucius was not "as good as" men who held high rank. This explains why Yang insists upon defining "fate" (ming) as "what is outside human control" (FY 6i17). Note the crucial difference between Yang Hsiung's position on fate and that of Wang Ch'ung: Wang, who favors absolute solutions, insists in most chapters of the LH that one's fate is entirely beyond one's control, while Yang argues only that it is partly beyond one's control. 108 - For the phrase "immersion" (ch'ien), see FY 5: 12-13. 109 - FY 1 :4. 110 - FY3:7. 111 - This is the point of Yang's remark in FY 1 :1, which says, "The archer Yi took his bow apart [in preparation for regluing it] after meeting Pen Meng [a legendary warrior who was more than his match]." Yang's frequent comparisons of the noble man to great mountains, rivers, and seas, as well as to the principal sources of light in the sky (sun and moon), suggest the good student's awareness of the gap between himself and the sages. For such comparisons, see FY 1:1, 1:2 (2x), 2:5, 2:6, 3:7, 3:8, 5:14, etc. FY 4: 12 follows Mencius in equating the "correct Way" with "following what is great." FY 6:16 characterizes the [true] teacher as one who values "knowing the knowledge of what is great [i.e., the wisdom of the sages]." It is Yang's belief in humans' profound potential for good that leads him to celebrate the phi- losopher Mencius. 112 - That is why FY 1 :3 equates the noble man's drive to emulate the Ancients with wealth (to purchase goods), with nourishment (to sustain the human nature), and with honorable burial (a fit end). 113 - See FY 4 :9-10 for the analogy that Yang constructs between the Confucian Way and the physical body; just like the human body, the Confucian Way works well only when it works as a whole system. Thus, its self-proclaimed adherents cannot pick and choose from it, as many of Yang's contemporaries tried to do. See also FY 3:8, where Yang argues that the human soul craves spiritual light Philosophy East &amp; West 184</page><page sequence="53">from the sages, which allows it to function properly, just as our eyes crave physical light, which allows them to function properly. Yang Hsiung never supplies a list of the basic drives inherent in human nature, but he seems not to depart from HsOn tzu's "On Ritual" chapter, which mentions the drives for food, shelter, sex, sensory pleasure, community, and symbolic association. 114 - Hence, Yang's emphasis on the supreme utility of conformity with the Way, as in FY3: 7, where the Way is compared to a variety of useful items, including houses and clothes; FY 4: 11, where the ritual system is compared to the writer's pen; ibid., where the sages' stratagems are called-for shock value-the ultimate in "leffective] duplicity" (i.e., stratagems better than those of the professional strategists); and FY 4:12, where the Way is said to give a ruler maximum control over the empire. 115 - FY 3:9. As a result of imitating the noble man, the student un- dergoes a miraculous process that Yang compares to the two-step process of making alchemical gold from base metals and then casting it in the semblance of a man (FY 1 : 1-2). Divinity is made from humans, but those divine qualities make humans still more fixed in their humanity. Cf. FY 5: 13, which says that "The divine qualities [of Confucius and Yen Hui] rested in what they were immersed in [i.e., the models of King Wen and of Confucius, re- spectively]." The same passage says that the mind that retains its original brilliance (because it seeks ultimate greatness) is also di- vine. In FY 5:15, Yang equates virtue with "great light." In FY 6:16-17, Yang suggests that conformity with the sages' Way makes students of the Way just as distinct from ordinary men as the phoenix, unicorn, and dragon are distinct from ordinary birds and animals. 116 - Sages are defined by their "singular [i.e., unusual] wisdom" (FY 3 9). FY 4: 10-11 implies an analogy between the sage's relation to the masses, and the Central Kingdom's relation to the barbar- ians, since only the Central Kingdom has chosen to define itself by its adoption of the Confucian ritual system. Yang also claims the Way can never be entirely reduced to some entity "easy to know" (FY 5:14). Therefore, Yang embraces a somewhat paradoxical view with regard to his readership: he does not discount anyone, yet he assumes that all his readers will be Ju. 117 - Yang Hsiung in FY 3 7 deals with the objection that very few ad- herents of Confucianism ever become in any way like Confucius. Yang replies that all good horse trainers aspire to have their horses attain horsely perfection, though few will do so. By analogy, the Michael Nylan 185</page><page sequence="54">best teachers of men will teach their students to aspire to human perfection, whether it is ultimately attainable or not. Cf. FY 6:16, which specifically refutes the idea that the Way of the Sages is of no benefit to the ordinary person, but is inherently an elitist Way. 118 - FY6:18 states, "He who loves what is great will act on its behalf" (alternately: he who loves what is great will become it). Such passages seem to reflect the Analects' statement regarding jen (Goodness): "In seeking jen, they got jen" (7/15); "If we wanted jen, we would find that it was at hand" (7/30); and "Wanting jen, they got jen" (20/2). FY 1:3 shows real teachers getting together to talk of their own particular form of riches, Goodness and duty (jen yi), just as merchants like to talk of their wealth. 119 - Here is FY 2 :5: "'Someone says, 'If there be a man among them who says of himself that he has taken the surname of Confucius and the style name of Chung-ni, that he has entered his door [i.e., fully mastered classical studies], ascended his hall, leant on his stool, and assumed his clothes, then can he be called Confucius?' [Yang] replies: [In such a case,] the pattern would be true, but the substance not." For Yang's pointed denunciations of the "Con- fucian" exam system in the Han, which allege that the exams themselves are responsible for undermining the goal of true Con- fucian learning, see FY 7:19-20 (2x). 120 - FY 3:7 says, "It is possible to make the sages' phrases; it is not possible to force people to believe them" [except by one's good example]. This may explain why Yang is proud of the FY but re- grets his earlier efforts to compose rhapsodic poems, which he believes only enticed members of the court to act out their baser instincts (FY2 :4). In FY6:18, Yang states that he will not worry if he fails to persuade readers by refusing to pander to their basest desires; he will worry, however, if he subverts the Way in order to win his readers' approval. 121 - At several places in the FY, Yang remarks that even moral wisdom cannot effectively improve situations once a certain time has past. See, e.g., FY 7: 21. 122 - FY 1:4, speaking of Yen Hui. For Yang's insistence that the good learner feels continual anxiety and worry at the gap between potential and true humanity, see FY 1 :2; for his portrait of Yen Hui, who "lamented Confucius' ultimate greatness," see FY 1 :4. I follow commentators in making this the subtext for a laconic pas- sage in FY 4:10, "There are those who know that it creates the highest [pleasure] and the lowest [suffering]." (Note: In supplying the material in brackets, I follow the commentators.) Philosophy East &amp; West 186</page><page sequence="55">123 - I direct the reader's attention to Yang's insistence that the true way of the Ju has nothing superfluous, redundant, or deficient in it; it is "exactly right," and spare-just like good taste (FY 4:11). As Yang himself describes adherence to the Confucian Way as the highest form of "good taste," this is no anachronistic application of current standards of good taste to the past. 124 - FY2:5. 125 - FY: 4:11, 3:9. 126 - FY6:16. 127 - FY 5:14 before the ellipsis; FY 6:17 after it. 128 - FY 1 :2 says, "Learning is the means whereby one seeks to be- come a noble man. There have certainly been cases where a per- son sought but did not attain [this goal]. But surely there has never been a person who did not seek and yet attained it [the goal]." 129 - See FY 4:11, for the notion that the Tao "sometimes conforms and sometimes changes." 130 - See FY 4: 11, for Yang's insistence that the Way sometimes con- forms and sometimes changes, and for Yang's belief that wu-wei only works in a few situations. In FY 5:13, if the commentators are correct, Yang insists that the definition of sagehood requires the sage not to be "tied hand and foot" [to one particular doc- trine]. Yang, throughout the FY (esp. in chap. 1, which is devoted to learning), argues the advantages of modeling oneself on a good teacher and the disadvantages of slavishly following set rules. Many Han thinkers found themselves on the defensive in seeking to explain the apparent differences found in the ruling principles adopted by the sage-kings of antiquity. As Loewe (1994), p. 137, recounts, Tung Chung-shu insisted that the received traditions re- garding the sage-kings show no real deviation from basic princi- ples, but the appropriate application of those basic principles, as circumstances demanded; see HSPC 56/16b. 131 - Insofar as Yang accepts the Changes' statement that "words can- not fully express one's mind; writings cannot fully express one's word," Yang believes that rule-making can only lead to trouble; see FY 5:14. 132 - FY 1 :1. In FY 1:2, Yang explains the seminal significance that the teacher has for the student, since the teacher is not only the stu- dent's chief moral example, but also his chief guide through the proliferating prescriptions found in the competing marketplace of ideas. FY2:6 says, "To love [old] books, but not regard Confucius Michael Nylan 187</page><page sequence="56">as the essential [model] for them is merely to be a bookstore. To love theories, but not regard Confucius as the essential [model] for them is merely to take delight in tinkling bells." The passage later continues, "He who has heard a lot retains it by keeping it simple. He who has seen a lot retains it by keeping it great." 133 - See the postface to FY 4, for the insistence on the Mean; also, FY 9:27, which says that the "fashioning of empire rests in balance"; and FY 12:37, which shows the noble man balancing weakness and firmness. Then see FY 3:8, which emphasizes the need to balance inner substance and outer form; FY 3 :9, which says that the sages "live for" the divine; FY 4:12, which insists that it is better to die than to depart from the Way; FY 5 :15, for a passage which says that one's virtue is most glorious if one acts regardless of public opinion [i.e., when one does not look for reward]; FY 1 :1, where Yang remarks that "[true] study [of the Ancients] does not desire anything [else]"; and FY 6:18, for praise of Yen Chiin- p'ing as a noble man who never acted for the sake of gain. 134 - Both Yang and Wang launch full-scale defenses against their contemporaries' charges that they have arrogantly "created" (tso) new teachings, rather than merely transmitted (shu) the old; see FY 5:14, LH chap. 84. For Yang's defense of the T'ai hsoan ching, written in the rhapsodic fu form, see The Han shu Biography of Yang Xiong (53 B.C.-A.D. 18), trans. and annot. David R. Knechtges (Tempe, Arizona: University of Arizona Press, 1982), pp. 45-52. 135 - Wang Ch'ung remarks that some found his writings "treasonous"; Yang Hsiung responded to critics who called him a failure by saying, "You only wish to have my carriage wheels painted ver- milion [i.e., to see me made a high official], but you fail to un- derstand that a single slip could redden [i.e., bloody] my entire clan"; see HHS 97B :3566, trans. after Knechtges, The Han shu Biography, p. 47. 136 - See, e.g., W.J.F.
