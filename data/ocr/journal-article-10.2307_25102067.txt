<plain_text><page sequence="1">FAITH AND CREDULITY. BY JOHN BURROUGHS. One of our most eminent doctors of divinity, Dr. Fisher, of Yale, has recently been discussing the nature of faith and reve lation in one of the popular magazines. The doctor says that sceptical writers are apt to " describe faith as an arbitrary, groundless acceptance of doctrines in be half of which no proof is possible. This is to confound faith and credulity." But the doctor does not himself make very clear the difference between the two. If faith goes upon proof, why not call it science ? Why is it so difficult ? It seems to me that the essence of religious faith is that it is independent of proof, and, at most, rests upon, or starts from, a degree of probability. Faith proper begins where reason ends; where reason avails we have no need of faith : where there is a bridge we do not need to take a leap. What can be proved to the understanding there is no escape from; but our religious cravings and aspira tions are entirely personal and subjective, and are not matters of evidence. Eeligious faith has to do with the supernatural; and what can reason or sense do with that which transcends reason and sense ? Credulity is quite a different thing. Credulity may be defined as belief without proof in matters where proof is demanded and is within reach. Faith is belief without proof in matters where proof is not possible. Mankind have always been very credulous ; credulity is easy ; we all have to fight against it. But faith, as Dr. Fisher insists, is not easy; it requires a strong effort of the will. Children are very credulous; they believe whatever we tell them without proof. Indeed, they do not yet know what proof is. So with savage tribes, though with them credulity mainly runs into superstition. Credulity is the basis of supersti tion. When the mysterious, the preternatural, is brought into matters capable of verification, when proof is dispensed with and the event or occurrence is referred to anti-mundane agencies, as in the case of haunted houses, etc., that is superstition. When Professor Bryce was about to ascend Mount Ararat, he</page><page sequence="2">4?0 !EHB NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. was told by the people at its base that the ascent was impossible ; that no human being would be permitted to behold the top of the sacred mountain. For all that, the plucky traveller thought he would put the matter to the test. He procured guides and set out. His guides failed him long before the summit was reached, but he pushed on alone, and scaled the peak. When he returned and had an interview with one of the religious dignitaries in a village near by, and his guide told the priest that the English man had been to the top of Ararat, the priest smiled loftily and said it was impossible?no man had ever been to the top of the mountain. There was superstition?belief in the interfer ence of the supernatural where proof or disproof was easy. I lately read in the autobiography of the Italian sculptor, Dupr&amp;, an incident which affords a similar illustration. Dupr&amp; was an excellent man and a great artist, but he was not above superstition, as few of us are. He was driving one day down a steep, rugged mountain road, accompanied by his wife, when he distinctly heard the words, " Stop, stop /" As he continued, the words were repeated, and so impressed them both that he did stop and look about him, and called out to his supposed challenger Seeing and hearing nothing more, he drove on, when "Stop, stop, stop!99 again rang out from some place near them. Then he again stopped, and, much impressed and even alarmed, he and his wife both got out of the carriage, when he discovered that the linchpin that held one of the hind wheels was gone, and that the wheel was far bent over and just ready to drop off, and thus endanger the lives of the occupants. The pious artist was deeply impressed, and evidently regarded the warning voice as providential. But a little investigation would doubtless have dispelled the delusion. Prob ably if he had started up his horses after he and his wife left the carriage, he would have discovered the source of the voice in the squeaking wheel. Whenever he had stopped the voice had stopped ; the moment he started the cry began. How full history, especially the religious history of the world, is of such or similar incidents ! Credulity underlying religious fear and hope is the basis of them all. In Catholic countries such superstitions thrive luxuriantly. Becently, while some friends of mine were stopping in Madrid, a good deal of excite ment was created by a reported miracle that had just happened : the beard of the picture of one of the saints in a certain church</page><page sequence="3">JFAITH and credulity. 471 had grown several inches during the night ! Our grandfathers, who nearly all believed in spooks, and witches, and hobgoblins, and various signs and wonders, were all victims of superstition. From simple credulity the element of the marvellous and pre ternatural is missing. Boswell told Dr. Johnson that while in Italy he had several times seen the experiment tried of placing a scorpion within a circle of burning coals, and that in every in stance the scorpion, after trying to break through the fiery circle, retired to the centre and committed suicide by darting its sting into its head. But the doctor was sceptical; appearances are deceptive; he would not believe the story unless some com petent anatomist, after dissecting the scorpion, declared that the creature really had killed itself. It was probably the doctor's combativeness, or disposition to differ, that saved him in that case. Had the story had any element of the mysterious or pre ternatural in it, so as to have touched Johnson's religious fears and prejudices, he would doubtless have accepted it at once. It was once commonly believed that the salamander could withstand fire, but an old Catholic traveller in the sixteenth cent ury says he caught one and put it into the fire, and it died. But he believed the story of the basilisk?namely, that its look was fatal. He said, though, that it was necessary for the animal to look its victim in the eye at a certain distance. He saw a basilisk, but it was dead. If it had been living, probably he would not have been as ready to test its powers as he was those of the sala mander. Like Dr. Johnson, he was not credulous unless his credulity could take a superstitious turn. A good instance of the credulity of science in its youth is furnished by Albert Magnus, who in his book upon animals, in the sixteenth century, says that eels leave the water in the night, invade fields and gardens, and feed upon peas and lentils. A French missionary, writing on natural history in the seventeenth century, says of the humming-bird, that it passes the winter in a torpid state, hanging by its feet from the under side of a limb in the woods. The credulity of country people in reference to the divining-rod, or the efficacy of twigs of the beech or the willow in the hands of certain persons in locating hidden springs or water-veins, etc., is equally childish. Credulity and superstition have to do mainly with the visible material universe; faith with the spiritual invisible world.</page><page sequence="4">472 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. Faith is, as Amiel says in his " Journal," "certitude without proof," and is therefore opposed to science, which goes entirely upon proof. It is a moral rather than an intellectual certitude ; a conviction of the heart?to use the old phraseology?rather than a persuasion of the mind. That is, it is arrived at through an emotional process, rather than through a mental or logical one. In an over-intellectual and over-reflective age like ours, faith un doubtedly suffers a decline. It thrives best in stirring uncritical times. The scientific spirit is as inimical to it as frost to ve geta tion. In all the centuries of our era, except the present, reason has been the willing servant of faith. Faith has said to it, Go here, go there ; prove this, prove that; and reason has obeyed with alacrity. In our day reason turns upon faith and questions its right to rule and to lead, and the result is an almost ruinous shrinkage of the old theological values. Dr. Fisher insists upon the proofs of faith, but he fails to point them out. They are not to be apprehended by the rational faculties. They are subjective; they are in the heart and con science of the individual, and cannot be communicated as proof. That there is a power not ourselves, a power in which we live, and move, and have our being, and of which all things are the gar ment and expression, is not a matter of faith, but of reason and sense. That this power is a personal being, the moral governor and ruler of the universe, as the old theology has it, or the loving father and protector, as the new teaches, is a matter of faith. We speak of the creed of the church as a system of faith. The ac ceptance of most of its tenets is an act of faith rather than of reason. That Jesus of Nazareth was born of a woman is a matter of reason; that he was born of a virgin and had no earthly father is a matter of faith. That he was persecuted, that he suffered and died upon the cross, we have no difficulty in believing; but that he rose from the dead, and ascended bodily up into heaven, is, again, a truth that belongs solely to faith. And so with the rest of the Apostles' Creed. There is a passage in Goethe's autobiography that bears upon this subject, and a very suggestive one. ' General, natural religion,' he says, properly speaking, requires no faith ; for the persuasion that a great producing, regulating, and conducting Being conceals him self, as it were, behind Nature, to make himself comprehensible to us?such a conviction forces itself upon every one. Nay, if we for a moment let drop this thread which conducts us through life, it may be immediately and everywhere resumed. But it is different with a special religion which announces to us that this Great</page><page sequence="5">FAITH AND CREDULITY. 47? Being distinctly and preeminently interests himself for one individual, one family, one people, one country. This religion is founded on faith, which must be immova ble if it would not be instantly destroyed. Every doubt of such a religion is fatal to it. One may return to conviction, but not to faith.** St. Paul saw the difficulties in the way of an appeal to reason, and said boldly that " no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost." To expect a man to affirm it by his unaided reason, or upon any grounds of evidence that can be had, is to expect the impossible. But Dr. Fisher says we have proof in its nature experimental, like the verification of the calculations of the astronomer by an eclipse occurring exactly on time?namely, in the miracles. But if an appeal is made to reason, does he not see that reason demands proof that the miracles occurred ? Eclipses occur in our day, but miracles do not. The laws and processes of nature are continuous, but theology introduces us to a world devoid of continuity. Theologians lay much stress upon contemporary belief and opin ion?upon the statement of those who themselves either witnessed the miracles or simply voiced the popular belief in their reality. But in such matters contemporary opinion counts for but little. The contemporary belfef in the reality of witchcraft is perfectly overpowering. There is not merely a cloud of witnesses?there is a world of witnesses. The contemporary belief in the statue of Lot's wife upon the shores of the Dead Sea and of the marvellous character of the Dead Sea itself?namely, that it was black and sticky, that it spit forth fire, that it threw up great foul masses that burned like pitch, that the fruit upon its shores was filled with ashes, etc.; that is, the testimony of reputable travellers, Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, who had visited the sea and wit nessed these wonders?is as convincing as such testimony can be. Yet do we not now know that either the witnesses saw falsely or else reported falsely what they saw ? Sir John Mandeville says he saw iron swim in the Dead Sea and a feather sink, and that it vomited up masses of fiery matter as big as a horse; and Sir John was a pious man. I think we may safely rest upon the statement that no natural evidence can establish the supernatural. Our senses cannot ap prehend it because it is supersensible ; our reason cannot verify it because it transcends reason. The historical proofs of Chris tianity are adequate to establish ordinary events, but not extraor dinary,</page><page sequence="6">474 mE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. Di, McCosh says the resurrection of Jesus is as well estab lished as any event of ancient history?as the death of Caesar, for instance. So it would be if it was a natural event like the death of Caesar; but it was a supernatural event, and no amount of evidence can make it credible to the understanding. Our only refuge is faith. John Locke stated the truth about this matter of faith and reason two hundred years ago. " There being many things," he says, " wherein we have very imperfect notions, or none at all; and other things of whose past, present, or future existence, by the nat ural use of our faculties, we can have no knowledge at all; these as being beyond the discovery of oar natural faculties, and above reason, are, when revealed, the proper matter of faith. Thus, that part of the angels rebelled against God, and thereby lost their first happy state; and that the dead shall rise and live again: these, and the like, being beyond the discovery of reason, are purely matters of faith, with which reason has directly nothing to do.'* But Locke says that reason is to judge whether or not the revela tion be genuine. Yet what test the reason has of the validity of a revelation the philosopher does not set forth. If the facts or truths revealed are above reason, how can the fact of the revelation itself be proved to reason ? Is faith itself reasonable ? Of course it all depends upon the assumption with which we start. If we start with the assumption upon which the church is founded, namely, the assumption of an anthropomorphic God, an Infinite Person, the creator and upholder of all things, whose plans with reference to man have not gone smoothly, but have been sadly deranged and frustrated by man himself through what we call sin, so that the creature is hopelessly estranged from the creator, and so on through the rest of the theological for mula,?if we start with this assumption, all the rest comes easy : faith and revelation are reasonable, the theory of the Christ and the atonement is reasonable, and with one or two more as sumptions, which Cardinal Newman readily makes, the Catholic Church becomes the very child and servant of reason. It is reasonable that this Infinite Person, who is not here upon earth, but in heaven, should want a representative, a vicar, in this world, to look after the well-being of his children, etc., and what more reasonable than that the great mother church, the church which the apostles founded, should be that vicar, that representative ? The Protestant churches are all more or less compromises with the devil?that is, with reason, with sense, with the natural man; but the Catholic Church makes no compromises with the individ</page><page sequence="7">Faith and credulity. 4?5 ual; it stands for authority. In fact, out of the purely human or anthropomorphic conception of the universe upon which our theology is based, it arises as the inevitable result. If your as sumption at one end of the Christian scheme is reasonable, your acceptance of the Catholic Church at the other is equally so. If the universe is an institution, a government, a hierarchy, and if mankind are in a lost and rebellious condition with reference to the head of this government or hierarchy, then does the idea of an infallible pope and all the saving ordinances of the church harmonize perfectly with this conception. When you once assume the existence of the supernatural, you adjust your reason to that assumption. "If the supernatural exists, it is reasonable that it should exist; it is reasonable that it should present difficulties, that we should be able to apprehend it only in part, that we should need a special endowment of power or insight, called faith, to fully enter into it; it is reasonable that faith should not obliterate the inferior intellectual faculties, but should supplement and raise them; it is reasonable that there should be a revealed religion, and that this religion should possess mysteries." St. Paul's definition of faith the religious mind has clung to very fondly?namely, "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen"; and Dr. Fisher's new version of the passage?namely, "the firm assurance of things hoped for, the being convinced of things not seen"?can hardly take its place in the popular conscience. It is true, but not taking. Faith is neither evidence nor substance, though the religious world is con stantly persuading itself that it is. "It makes real to the mind objects of hope"?so real that " they exercise a due control in the shaping of conduct." As we have been long taught, belief in the Christian religion is more a matter of will than of reason. The will must be reached or enlisted first. Coleridge said to Crabb Robinson that " religious belief is an act, not of the understanding, but of the will. To become a believer one must love the doctrine and feel in harmony with it, and not sit down and coolly inquire whether he should believe it or not." Hence I agree with Dr. Fisher that in these matters " the timidity of reason has to be overcome by a courageous exercise of will. In appropriating, or making our own, the things of faith,</page><page sequence="8">476 THE NO&amp;TB AMERICAN REVIEW. there is a venture to be made on the ground of evidence, without the stimulus and support of an appeal to the senses." People of strong wills, men of action and of affairs, are less apt to be scep tical than more purely meditative and intellectual minds. Words worth said of his poet, " You must love him, ere to you He wiU seem worthy of your love "; and of the Christian faith it is equally true that you must believe it ere it seems worthy of your credence. How to do this is the great problem. Hence the cry that goes up from the churches continually for more faith, more faith. I have said that faith begins where reason ends; but by this statement I would only emphasize the fact that the province of the one lies entirely outside the province of the other. In the order of nature faith is first. We find ourselves in possession of a certain belief or certitude, and then we proceed to reason about it. In the order of historical development religion is not a matter of belief, of creeds and dogmas, but of observances. The early nations had certain religious rites and practices, but no be lief, in our sense of the word?that is, as a conscious intellectual act. A man cannot reason himself into religion, though he can reason himself into religious opinions. Eeligion is a sentiment just as much as poetry is, and does not wait upon the logical faculties any more than poetry does. The demonstrations of science no competent mind can resist, but the demonstrations of religion, its proofs, evidences, etc., only impress such minds as are already convinced, as have already taken the leap which faith requires. Eeligious faith is losing ground in our day because the light which fills the world, begotten by science, education, industry, democracy, is more and more the light of broad noonday, clear, strong, merciless. Our fathers stood much nearer the twilight, the region of sentiment, of emotion, of enticing, but delusive, lights and shades. The morning of the world is past: what the completed day will show forth does not yet appear. John Burroughs.</page></plain_text>
