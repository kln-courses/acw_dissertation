<plain_text><page sequence="1">Track Organology* DOUGLAS KAHN The Weight of Music The division between sound and musical sound is negotiated and policed in terms of a traditionally established axis irrelevant to most music. For twentieth- century Western art-music theory, however, it is relevant. And for theoretically inspired music impinging upon notions of worldly sound as discursive foil and actual material--music generated in response to changing social conditions of aurality--the implications of this unacknowledged dividing line are crucial. Music's dominance gained momentum from its complacent valorization as the sine qua non of the arts of sound. Its establishment as such has served to stifle the other arts of sound: the blinded ones, the multisensory ones, and the daily experience of aurality in general. Music in turn has, ironically, weighed upon itself through its imagined mission, whose goal- the modeling of proliferation, the charting of sublimity, and the providing of a Dionysian rebuff to constraint - is itself constraining and constrained. Musical ideas and analogies are constantly employed throughout the non- musical arts, and the closer their proximity to sound, the more powerful they become as productive aids, circumventions, or impediments. Within the period of modernism and the avant-garde, when many present-day assumptions were generated, music was valued as a model of artistic ambitions for self-containment. Having already thus arrived at what the other arts sought, music failed to question its own representational operations, even though acoustic and elec- tronic recording were to offer other possibilities. Thus secured, musical auto-re- ferentiality did violence to a system of aural signification whereby the associative characteristics of sounds, their attendant social and imaginative domains, were reduced, trivialized, or eradicated. * Many thanks to Fran Dyson for her assistance with this essay, and to Mitchel Clark, Heidi Grundman, Dan Lander, Christopher Schiff, Ron Kuivila, Dan Warner, and Gregory Whitehead.</page><page sequence="2">68 OCTOBER A reading/listening of music from the time of Luigi Russolo's formal introduction of noise in 1913 to John Cage's musically emancipatory postwar endgame demonstrates that the incorporation of ever-expanding realms of hith- erto extramusical sound has been performed strategically to rejuvenate musical practice. Russolo, however, contradicted his profession of a potentially autono- mous "art of noise" in his writings, his compositional and performance practice, and in the design of his instruments by diminishing a complete play of the aural signification of worldly sounds to their timbral signatures in order to engineer "a great renovation of music." From that point on, Western art music has been consistent in its maintenance of a unity for music. Varese battled against noise and imitation to situate his own "liberation of sound" more securely within the conservative institutions of Western art music. Stockhausen valorized electronic sounds over "all instrumental or other auditive associations; such associations divert the listener's comprehension from the self-evidence of the sound-world presented to him because he thinks of bells, organs, birds, or faucets."' Pierre Schaeffer similarly safeguarded musique concrete, beginning with his very first work Etude aux chemins de fer, and continuing in a recent statement: You have two sources for sounds: noises, which always tell you something-a door cracking, a dog barking, the thunder, the storm; and then you have instruments. An instrument tells you, la-la-la-la (sings a scale). Music has to find a passage between noises and instru- ments. It has to escape. It has to find a compromise and an evasion at the same time; something that would not be dramatic because that has no interest to us, but something that would be more interesting than sounds like Do-Re-Mi-Fa. .. .2 The intrinsic despair of "compromise and . . evasion" found quick and sad fruition even more recently, however, in an interview in which Schaeffer dis- missed his entire career as having been a futile venture, returning to an ex- tremely conservative notion that no music was possible outside of conventional musical sounds: "It took me forty years to conclude that nothing is possible outside Do-Re-Mi . . ."S (When told of Schaeffer's lament, Cage replied, "He should have kept going up the scale.") In 1963 the famed musicologist H. H. Stuckenschmidt framed musique concrete in terms of a feminized mystery of music: 1.

It is a technique of metamorphosis with results no less astonishing than the ancient metamorphoses of mythology described by Ovid, such as the transformation of a nymph into a laurel tree.4 The traditional ritual of negotiation will be present in any and all arenas of discourse and event has its further cast of characters: the work of Pierre Boulez, Milton Babbit, Hans Werner Henze, Trevor Wishart, Chris Cutler, Alan Durant, Evan Eisenberg, Marvin Minsky, Throbbing Gristle, Peter Kivy, Jean-Jacques Nattiez, Roger Reynolds. While its terms may be indispensable to the policing of musical boundaries, the strategies of proliferation, rhetorical play, and semiotic mobility characteristic of certain postmodern and poststructuralist theory de- mand their replacement. These strategies would provide a means of response to the problematizing or transgression of musicalization. They do not necessarily entail an attempt to constitute a "sound" composition consisting of that which music has historically excluded, for that would simply repeat the same demarca- tive procedures. One might, of course, expect Roger Scruton to balk at quota- tions of Charles Ives, or Claude LUvi-Strauss to pull up short at musique concrete. One is, however, somewhat surprised by the thoroughgoing Ludditism of Jacques Attali. In Noise, he makes the phonograph the wicked steam engine of the era of "repetition," banishing it from the desirable epoch of "composition." And Deleuze and Guattari, the champions of deterritorialization, toe the line with an even finer irony. Having celebrated Varese's composition as an exem- plary musical machine- "a sound machine (not a machine for reproducing sounds), which molecularizes and atomizes, ionizes sound matter and harnesses a cosmic energy" 5-and after suggesting the extension of the electronic synthe- sizer to philosophy- "like a thought synthesizer functioning to make thought travel, make it mobile, make it a force of the Cosmos (in the same way as one makes sound travel)"6 - they flash the inevitable warning: "Sometimes one overdoes it ... " The claim is that one is opening music to all events, all irruptions, but one ends up reproducing a scrambling that prevents any event from happening. All one has left is a resonance chamber well on the way to forming a black hole. A material that is too rich remains too "territori- 4. H. H.

(this even applies to Cage's prepared piano).7 Of course, the name of Cage leaps instinctually to the lips of most post- modern theorists when required to add a musical name (acid test: do they ever name a tune?) to the roster of painters, poets, novelists, theorists, architects, and the like. But Cage's emancipatory endgame does not depart from Russolo's modernist strategy for musical rejuvenation. The "lateness" of his modernism is directly related to the conservatism of Western art music. Cage performed the last possible modernist renovation of Western art music and thereby "filled music up." After him there is no dividing line between musical sound and sound because all sound can be music. Also, there need be neither artistic intention nor any other act of human volition except the willingness to attune to aural phenom- ena for music to exist. This collapse of sound into a problematic of musical sound betrays a contradiction at the very center of his philosophy. By saying that sounds not intrinsically human should be thought of as music, he contradicts his anti- anthropomorphism. His suppression of anthropomorphism opposes the politics of ecology, which must begin with an assumption of both the social incursion into nature and the historical determination of the very idea of nature. Cage's sub- scription to Eastern philosophies--which were constituted prior to the effective capacity for domination of nature, let alone total global ruin - betrays his notion of an idealized separation of nature and society. He speaks for an odd transcen- dence through musical means that entails something of an urban asceticism. Individuals lack or must deny or purge themselves of subjectivity, sociality, and historical situation in order to become empty vessels, receptive of the aural surround as natural and pure as the air they breathe. In fact, it is because he understands music to be a natural element of the world that his claims for "all sound" run counter to an ecology of aural signification that includes sociality. The Nature of Sound The naturalizing consequences of avant-garde musicalization have run counter to the increasing sociality of sound within the century of sound-- maturation of phonography and telephony, microphony, amplification, sound film, incidence of radio, television, synthesis, acoustical engineering, virtuality, and so on--where technologies proper are both marked by and the markers of complex relationships among social practices. The early breakup of naturaliza- tion began with the rise of communications technologies in the nineteenth cen- tury. The result was the technical capacities to see visual sound and visual speech 7. Ibid., p. 344.</page><page sequence="6">72 OCTOBER and to transport over great distances the movements of the finger and the voice. Phonography played a crucial role, for with it came the unique ability to return the subject's voice to his or her own ears; previously this return had been limited to mandibular and cranial resonance along the throat on up through the head. The voice as the privileged site of union between audition and utterance (per- haps the most common privatized act performed in the company of others) was "deboned" as vocal presence was wrenched from the throat and phonographi- cally inscribed. This served to represent and technologically manifest the sever- ance of speech from the speaker, the voice from the body, the voice from the soul, and the voice from the literary voice. The mix of utterance and audition moved from experience to representation, a representation bereft of the reson- ating chamber of the skull or the reflective landscapes of the echo; but it could move back toward experience, simulating it, in moments of dislocation, composi- tion, relocation, dispersal, and so forth. Ultimately, however, at the turn of the century, the mix and mobility remained fixed in systems of mechanics, scientism, natural philosophy, metaphysics of presence, spiritualism, Gesamtkunstwerk, syn- esthesia, etc. The twentieth century of perception actually got underway, according to Henri Lefebvre, with a decline and breakdown of referentials around the years 1905-10.8 The importance of referentiality did not decrease. Because it was problematized it became more of a concern, eliciting its first trenchant critiques and desperate celebrations. A contributing factor and consequence of this break- down was a growth in the complexity of the senses--not a commonsense of coming together, but an articulation of senses within complex configurations, with listening among them. Ears had not suddenly grown prehensile, but what was made of what was listened to and listened for had become increasingly social, cognitive, and self-conscious. Furthermore, it is not only that the complexity of our senses and of the information they impart has increased; the sense of hearing has acquired a greater aptitude for interpreting visual perceptions and the sense of sight for interpreting auditive ones, so that they signify each other reciprocally. The senses are more highly educated and their theoretical ability has increased; they are becoming "theoreticians"; by discarding immedi- acy they introduce mediation, and abstraction combines with immedi- acy to become "concrete." Thus objects in practice become signs, and 8. Henry Lefebvre, Everyday Life in the Modern World (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Books, 1984), pp. 110-14. "A hundred years ago words and sentences in a social context were based on reliable referentials that were linked together, being cohesive if not logically coherent, without however constituting a single system formulated as such. These referentials had a logical or common- sensical unity derived from material perception (euclidean three-dimensional space, clock time), from the concept of nature, historical memory, the city and the environment or from generally accepted ethics and aesthetics" (p. 111).</page><page sequence="7">Track Organology 73 signs objects; and a "second nature" takes the place of the first, the initial layer of perceptible reality.9 Within the avant-garde at about this time, sound began to be consistently conceived in nonmusical and nonsynesthetic ways, relating instead in a new way to graphic, textual, spatial, spatial/static, conceptual, and corporeal forms. Im- portant in this respect were Roussel's novels, Duchamp's ideas for conceptual sound, Marinetti's documentary onomatopoeia, Apollinaire's writings, the French Surrealists' approach to sound and their antipathy to Western art music, and so forth. Some ambitions were keyed to actual phonographic realization, among them: Dziga Vertov's aspirations to develop stenographic audio montage within a Laboratory of Hearing; Moholy-Nagy's plans for a phonographic alpha- bet of all sounds-his lost drawn-sound film The Sound of ABC and the drawn- sound films of others; certain H6rspiele of the Weimar period, Ruttmann's Week- end among them; and the brash experimentation introducing Alexandrov's Romance Sentimentale (debatedly in collaboration with Eisenstein). These ambi- tions remained isolated and never attained a state resembling an established practice. Optical sound film held out the greatest technological promise through its plasticity and graphic overlap with writing. During the mid-1930s, however, the question as to why this promise was never fulfilled exceeded attempts at its realization. In the latter half of the 1920s, however, radio and the sound film did change sound in two major ways. They introduced spatial representation and modulation among the auricular and ventricular chambers of minds, bodies, and environments, and they introduced on a social scale a pervasive, detailed, and atomized encoding. For the first time, a diapason of worldly sound encom- passing all of its visual, literary, environmental, gestural, and affective context could be displaced, presented, and represented. Worldly sound became worldly; the nature of sound was less natural; the realm of sound expanded and the number of sounds increased, confirming Lefebvre's claim that "The senses are more highly educated. .. ." By the 1950s, when, for instance, Cage's influence was beginning to be registered, television was introduced, and there had already been more than two very active decades during which cinema and radio bel- lowed, often in a mutally parasitic manner. Sound began to be sedimented with multiple allusions and meanings. The famed ephemerality of music itself began to be inflected with code, even if it was just the code of a famed ephemerality. In a century during which the nature of sound had increasingly become one of sociality, the goal of Cage's art - "to imitate nature in the manner of her operation"- has become beleaguered, and Adorno's axiom- "music rescues name as pure sound-but at the cost of severing it from things" -has become deeply wistful.'0 9.

Recent appropriative strategies within Western art music at least acknowledge the sociality of musical sound, including that which was once noise (as well as novelty music, cartoon music/fx, Spike Jones, and others), and have incor- porated it on an elemental level. Music has always covered and quoted other music, but this has relied upon appropriations at least as long as a melodic fragment, in which ostensibly neutral elements are organized to invoke a for- merly meaningful experience. Now, however, single sounds - those of a twangy guitar such as that of the Ventures, Duane Eddy, Ennio Morricone, spaghetti westerns, Clint Eastwood films, John Zorn arrangements, etc.-are deployed. But no one, to my knowledge, yet composes musically in a semiotic framework within which, among other possibilities, the vertical organization of encoded elements strains at the coherence of a passage through associative irregularities, chains, and din - the role formerly reserved for dissonance. All this would still remain comfortably within the prescribed bounds of music. But composition could go much further if the demarcation were ignored. From the graphic, textual, spatial/static, spatial, conceptual, and corporeal regis- ters of sound, combinatory possibilities suggest the development of numerous transformative rhetorics. For example, even while being crassly formal, consider a mobility of the voice as generated amid noise teased out of noise by signal, then sustained at a fevered pitch in text with three-part harmony bleeding off to a space in the body which is racked and choked in puns, overtones, and allusions of choking and so on. What will be required are notions based on a materiality of sound and grounded in the idea that sound's ambient medium is not merely air. All the absorption, refraction, reflection, inflection, bifurcation, multi-tracking, mixing, bodies, voices, writings, spaces, places, noises, and information; all in- scriptive, dislocative, migratory, and reconfigurative strategies of the reproduc- tion and necrosis you've come to expect is not merely air. Instruments are currently pitched for composition, writing, and accumula- tion, not for performance, speech, and improvisation. They are laggard and methodical like a pen, not fast and first-draft like a tongue. Writing condenses through the action of the writer's repeated listenings to the art-work-in-forma- tion prior to public display; an accumulation of listening and utterance is thus stacked amid a detached interlocution. A certain sense of writing has been technologically facilitated by the increased availability of digital audio recording workstations" capable of providing this form of writing with sound, or rather, a 11.

Workstations present a graphic representation alluding to the alphabet of all audible sounds entertained by avant-gardists in the 1920s and 1930s. Workstations can cut and paste at subperceptual durations and thereby simulate signifiers; they can pivot, branch out, detour, and flesh out. And, like any other form of recording they can also manipulate durations of pure tedium. There is no restriction to duration that mandates sequencing, no neces- sary adherence to any form of interval. Rather, the configurations are potentially rhetorical in the most general sense of the word, and they are very conducive to admixture, stretch, continua, and transformation. Such compositional latitude results from the conflicting industrial exigen- cies of film/video and music (post-dub and mastering) being designed into the technology, a conflict that makes it much easier to defeat the technology's protocol for artistic purposes. For instance, although subperceptual editing is designed for glitch control, it can be redirected toward constructing sounds/ words from the inside out and toward semanticizing glitches. Likewise, although macro manipulation at the textual level is designed to expedite production, it can be redirected toward intensification. Even a minimal effort invested in the defeat of the technology, however, necessarily leaves scars; the original never exists, but it is always signal (despite the fact that the terms one hears are either synthesis or recording, either complete artifice or lack of it, never simulation). Workstations mimic synthesis because the cut-and-paste editing occurs at such a minute level that it is transformed into a generative operation independent of its source. The charade is displayed when an elastic independence from the source is amplified and results in the emblem of the technology: electronic grate and sheen. There can be no writing from scratch. The source is always generated with its microphones posed, spaces modu- lated, networks played back, already marked. Composing with and through it layers code upon code, including codes that can distract and otherwise interfere. The code of the technology can itself be easily shielded and, although this is what most people are offered, it can occur in a spirit of masquerade. The primary dependence is upon recorded sources, requiring a working mode of interpola- tion that functions best with a quantity of material at hand, and this presents some severe limitations. But the amount of accumulated and composited material - whether recorded, prerecorded, or played back again; available from archives, cheap recording, or the daily din- does not exactly represent a crip- pling situation, nor does the simulation of the most common unrecorded and unrecordable sound - the sound of verbal thought. The next generation of extend this list considerably. Digital workstations are relatively user-friendly and thereby promise some relief from the thick toys-for-boys climate of programming, mathemusic, and electronics that plagues the experimental media arts of sound. Equipped with the desktop and word-processing designs, the field should soon open to all those who write, not just those who solder.</page><page sequence="10">76 OCTOBER technology will break free of such accumulation through analysis and resynthesis; eventually sophistication will be gauged by the minuteness of the sample needed to elicit a simulation of potentially infinite articulation. A formal trope for a compositional process can begin with the capability to join sonic and phonic events at the level of the signifier and move to and from larger events and to fields between and among them. To date, however, concen- tration on the auditive signifier has been contained by the urge to anchor an event in physicality, technicism, in utterance and presence, in asocial tropes of nature, in a modeling of events outside of it, and, when it comes to composition with sound conceived at a minute level, in music. Yet the signifier is already somewhere else. It signifies before it exists in its own right. It is therefore never an anchor, but something continually in transit, dispersing movement into other areas.12 This dispersal could be the figure of echo as allusion, echo as decay into resonance, an allusion to noise, or it can be modeled on coarticulation, a phono- logical term for a meshing of adjacent phonemes (especially vowels, glides, nasals, and laterals) such that it becomes extremely difficult if not impossible to describe when one ends and the other begins. They are cast in anticipation and recursion, not vertically like simultaneity, although new harmonies and counterpoints could be built. The greatest benefit is the increased probability of encountering "un- spoken" nascent or moribund states"s and the capacity to extend procedures to the coarticulations of ideology. Ideologues themselves can be ventriloquized, as can any voice given a proper supply. This paradigmatic practice of generating uncharacteristic candor or untypical intensity is afforded by the ambiguity often attendant upon sound. As site of redirection, amplification, and ambiguation, then, one could explore intricate transitions. There would be certain expecta- tions for the existence of a median between two sounds, including a vocal median between two people, whereas in reality the characteristics would be entirely arbitrary, and a gradient between them would provide an occasion for a trail that would always be off-track. 12. Acts of "privileging the signifier," if they truly aspire to this figure, must become mobile. Pregutteral and musicalized speech/sound performed under these auspices would be self-contradic- tory. Even the musical privileging of pitch over timbre is called into question. It is still argued that musical elements must remain "minimally encoded" and "highly polished" (Serres) to appeal to universality, to relate "partial to global structures" (Boulez), and to be comprehensible in passages of horizontal or vertical density. The former two ideas should be manifest as ambient sounds for watchmakers. Difficulties with timbral and invocatory density should have been addressed long ago by Cagean musical listening and by acknowledging the capacities already practiced in mass media, spectacular viewing/listening, and much not so spectacular. 13. For example, Russolo crudely proposed that the acoustic periodicity of conventional musical sound is inscribed in vowels and the aperiodicity of noise is inscribed in consonants. Thus, in someone's speech or in any type of auditive event, there is not only an inscription of one sound upon another, there is a coarticulatory relationship of large categories of sound from one moment to the next.</page><page sequence="11">Track Organology 77 But this is all composition; workstations are still modeled upon the desk top, not the stage. The instruments are not pitched to speaking and performance. Digital sampling, unlike digital recording workstations, has been generated al- most entirely within a framework of music, which is thus burned into the design of the sampler. Certain limitations of the musical sampler can be defeated, but with undue effort for little result. But how would another type of digital record- ing-based instrument be constructed? It would be constructed first of all by an entirely reconstructed concept of the instrument, beginning with the simple question, "where and what is the instrument?" The sound of a musical instru- ment is thought to be contained by the instrument itself; the sound of a violin may be directly traced to action upon the physical materials and mechanics of the violin. Recorded sound or radiophonic sound cannot be traced in the same manner but must be played across locations. Instruments, therefore, are to be constructed as much at the constellated semiotic dislocations invoked by the sound as at the immediate physical site of physiological contact by the performer. Instruments constructed in and with the medium of semiosis are exceedingly malleable and transformative; they can "fold back" upon themselves like a Klein bottle by incorporating the presumed integrity of the performance itself into a rhetoric constructed dislocatively; they can dissolve any lingering distinctions among instrument, performance, and composition; and they are theoretically infinite. The biggest challenge becomes to name the instrument, which may be as constraining as the name of your best friend, your own, or that of an epoch. Naming cannot be equated with the simple metonymic procedures of sampling, quotation, and appropriation. Metonyms would of course play a large part, not as reductive markers that organize and silence what they exclude, but as way stations dispersing attention to the elements of what was, could have been, or could have never been excluded, or even as markers of formations constructed within the performance itself. It should be remembered, however, that some very simple musical instruments require years of intense study to master in performance and that instrument-building itself can be an extremely meticulous practice; the expediencies usually associated with digital electronics should not mask the possibility of a similarly rigorous practice for this new class of instruments. The physical attributes of the instrument should be built with aspects over- lapping and leading past the writing-oriented model of the desktop digital work- station (perhaps by shorthand?), and the intervalic segmentation of musical samplers should be extended to designs based upon the space of gesture and the recursive and "fuzzy" segmentation of a general grammar, or of elements within a constituted rhetoric. It is obvious that the two general areas of construction - in semiosis and physical-electronics - would be entirely interdependent. Both aspects of construction are unorthodox and unfamiliar and require equally com- prehensive attention; the former, however, should be privileged, i.e., the instru-</page><page sequence="12">78 OCTOBER ment should be named before it is built, not only to hold in check the technicism that plagues all types of design but, more substantively, because it would be extremely presumptuous to build a general physical instrument that would put undue restrictions upon the field of potential instruments. The technological area of virtual reality promises a hospitable topos for these types of considerations because - and this is not a prediction - spectatorial systems of representation are at once sensorially coordinated, completed, and then forever confounded by experiential modes of activity. Composition and performance will have incredible transformative capacity over all elements of the sensorium, including the actual venue and the corporeality of everyone "present." It must be emphasized, however, that the instruments described in this essay are not dependent upon any "new technology" in the physical-elec- tronic sense, just in design, and that there is no guaranty whatsoever that virtual reality will not repeat one more time the inhibitive precepts of modernism, musicalization, and musicalized postmodernism.</page></plain_text>
