Sperber's insights on thÃ¨ Teraphims interpretation as pickled red men In a Hebrew-language ar- ticle, Daniel Sperber (1995) showed how thÃ¨ biblical ac- count of Rachel stealing thÃ¨ Teraphim (unsually under- stood as Penates) of her father, Laban (Genesis, 31:19, 31:34- 35), was integrated with leg- endary elements in rabbin- ic sources, in such a way that she was shown to have done so in order to protect her fam- ily from Laban, who other- wise would have made magie use of those objects. The lat- ter were taken to be mummies, that could be magically inter- rogated1. David Mescheloff summa- rized Sperber s paper in Eng- lish as follows (1995, p. xiv): Rabbinic and medieval Jewish sources describe thÃ¨ Teraphim of Genesis 31, 19 as pickled red men [my emphasis] who were capable of foretelling thÃ¨ fu- ture. In "Teraphim", Daniel Sperber traces thÃ¨ various el- ements which make up this strange legend to a variety of disparate sources, demonstrat- ing how this motif evolved. This was part of a represen- tation of thÃ¨ pagan Laban that made thÃ¨ character especial- ly forbidding, further to his quite flawed behaviour as de- scribed in Scripture. Sperber showed that as thÃ¨ legendary interpretation of Labans Ter- aphim evolved from thÃ¨ ver- sion given in PirqÃ© deRabbi 'EliÃ©zer (a Jewish homiletical work from Palestine, ca. 8th century), thÃ¨ nature of thÃ¨ Ter- aphim was described different- ly. Originally, it was claimed that these were magical im- plements, which pagans ob- tained by severing thÃ¨ head of a firstborn male person, pre- serving it with salt and bal- sam, and placing it on a gold- en tray on which a magical for- mula was inscribed (Sperber, ibid., p. 372). The same is also related in thÃ¨ pseudo-Jonath- an Jewish Aramaic translation (and elaboration) of Genesis (Sperber, ibid.). In later versions - in thÃ¨ per- icope Vayyetse'm SÃ©fer haRoqÃ©ah by Rabbi Eliezer of Worms (b. Mainz, 1160, d. Worms, 1237), while commenting on Gene- sis, 39:19, as well as in thÃ¨ com- mentary ad toc. by Rabbi Me- nahem Tsiyyoni (Worms, I5th century) - it is stated that thÃ¨ person so sacrificed had to be an *adam 'adom (DITO D7K), "a red person". Sperber, ibid., p. 373, propends to reject thÃ¨ hypothesis that this version arose from a wrong repetition, and proposes instead that it existed in thÃ¨ earlier sources as well, from which it was deleted by emendation (as some copy- ist must have thought it was a wrong repetition). According to Sperber, thÃ¨ description of thÃ¨ sacrifice was originally applied to thÃ¨ Phoe- nicians (who used to sacri- fice their firstborn children indeed, a practice associat- ed with thÃ¨ tophet of Phoeni- cian and Carthaginian colo- nies throughout thÃ¨ Mediter- ranean). The very name of thÃ¨ Phoenicians, in Greek, was de- rived from cpolvic; for *red\ (Sperber adopts thÃ¨ etymolo- gy according to which thÃ¨ eth- nic name was given because of thÃ¨ involvement of thÃ¨ Phoe- nicians in thÃ¨ produetion of purple dye). Whereas it is quite possible that thÃ¨ early rabbinic litera- ture would reimagine Phoe- nician or Canaanite pagan practices in a horrified man- ner1 - and one can find indeed a legendary narrative in thÃ¨ homiletical literature, about 1 Similarly, in Section 3 below, a child flees taking a skull that otherwise his captors could in- terrogate, to capture him again. 2 An account of cruelty based on an individuai case, is thÃ¨ an- ecdote about a Kutaean who bound his own father and let his dog eat him alive. On thÃ¨ other hand, a paragon of filial piety is, in thÃ¨ talmudic literature, thÃ¨ pagan Dama, a notable of As- calon, about whom anecdotes were related: he wouldn t wake his father in order to obtain thÃ¨ key to a coffer, thus renounc- ing a major business deal, and when his crazy mother hit him on his head and spate in his face in front of thÃ¨ city council, he didn t react other than by ask- ing her: "Mother, enough".</page><page sequence="2">134 EPHRAIM NISSAN how a pagan father would take his son to thÃ¨ temple of thÃ¨ Moloch to be sacrificed, enter- ing a succession of inner and inner rooms, until thÃ¨ child was put in thÃ¨ fire and pagan priests kept drumming to cov- er thÃ¨ victims cries3 - I would like to state thÃ¨ importance, in this context, of Egyptian hu- man sacrifices. In fact, Sperber refers to thÃ¨ victims made in- to Teraphim as being explicitly red. This carries significance, in an Egyptian context. Social anthropologist Sir James George Frazer (1854- 1941), in his dassic The Gold- en Bough (Pt. 4, voi. 2, p. 97), stated: "With regard to thÃ¨ ancient Egyptians we have it on thÃ¨ authority of Manetho that they used to bum red- haired men and scatter their ashes with winnowing fans". That Egyptian rite was intend- ed to ensure fertility for thÃ¨ earth. Frazer listed examples, drawn from various cultures, of human sacrifices intend- ed to make thÃ¨ ground fertile, and Adi Zemach (1998, pp. 44- 45) mentions this in relation to agriculturalist Cain slaying thÃ¨ shepherd Abel. Sperber (1995, p. 374) as- cribes thÃ¨ detail about thÃ¨ sev- ered head being mummified (instead of just thÃ¨ skull being preserved) to a coincidence: a transcription of thÃ¨ Hebrew word terafim into Greek would have resulted in Gepoupiv or Bepacpeiv, thus being amena- ble (once one also considers that [f] and [p] in Hebrew and Aramaic are allophones of thÃ¨ phoneme /p/) to fblk-ety- mology relating thÃ¨ term (as though it was Geparceiv) to thÃ¨ Greek verb GepcwteiKD, which in turn had thÃ¨ acceptations 'to serve', 'to heaT (cf. English therapy), and also 'to mummi- fy\ thÃ¨ latter sense being doc- umented in an Egyptian Greek text from thÃ¨ fourth century CE, namely, Harapollos Hie- roglyphica, i. 39. 2. The Teraphim and Michal'strick Mandelkern (1896, edn. 1977Â» PP- 1252-1253, s.v. D^JJ) defines terafim in Latin as usu- ally understood, "dii domes- tici, penates", and then, in a Hebrew note, cites Joseph Ha- levy s interpretation: "thÃ¨ skel- eton of thÃ¨ human body that remains after thÃ¨ flesh is de- composed (in Ethiopian rpn 'thÃ¨ remaining'), like reliquiaÃ©" (sic, in Latin). The peculiar tradition of in- terpretation of thÃ¨ Teraphim as being a mummified severed head was by no means thÃ¨ on- ly one found in Jewish exeges- is. In / Sarnuel, 19:13 and 19:16, it is related that when Saul sends men to guard David's house with thÃ¨ order of killing him in thÃ¨ morning, Michal, Saul's daughter and David's wife, warns David, has him flee from thÃ¨ window, and simu- lates his being in bed by plac- ing there thÃ¨ Teraphim she had at home (pace Samuel's re- proach, in 1 Samuel, 15:23, to Saul, in which he mentioned Teraphim as a metaphor for something obviously unworthy of Hebrew piety), and placed a hide on top of them, so that thÃ¨ hair of thÃ¨ hide would look like a person's hair (accord- ing to David Qimhi),4 or as though David had covered his hair with thÃ¨ hide for warmth (according to Gersonides).* In his commentary to 1 Samuel, 15:23, Gersonides ex- plained thÃ¨ magie involved in questioning thÃ¨ Teraphim: he claimed that using them aroused thÃ¨ questionerÃ  im- agination, resulting in a mix of true insights and false ones, like in a dream. In his commentary to / Samuel, 19:13, Gersonides ex- plains that thÃ¨ Teraphim were shaped like a human body. David Qimhi, ad loc, cited Abraham ibn Ezras commen- tary to GenesiSy 31:19, in which 3 It is important to realize that this late antique account was legen- dary, indeed with fabulous fea- tures, and temporally locateci in Canaan between three quarters of a millennium to over a mil- lennium earlier. This can also be seen from a separate early rabbin- ic text mentioning thÃ¨ Moloch, in which a legalistic discussion ana- lyzes thÃ¨ pentateuchal condem- nation of child sacrifÃ-ce by fire, as practised by Canaanite paganism. The casuistry of thÃ¨ discussion of thÃ¨ biblica] wording with thÃ¨ par- titive, "who gives of his offspring to thÃ¨ Moloch" (what about one who sacrificed allof his offspring? or himself?), is cogent proof that thÃ¨ debating Sages considered thÃ¨ universe in which such a practice was real, to be quite remote. 4 The exegete and grammarian Rabbi David Qimhi (or Radaq, b. 1160?, d. 1235?) is one tne main Jewish medieval biblical exegetes, and there also were Christian He- braists or apologetes who pub- lished his biblical commentaries. His grammatica! writings were analysed by thÃ¨ linguist William Chomsky (father of thÃ¨ more fa- mous linguist Noam Chomsky), who nevertheless only translat- ed thÃ¨ introduetion verbatim, re- organizing thÃ¨ rest in a form ac- cessible to readers used to mod- ern grammars (Chomsky 1952). Moreover, on David Qimhi and his biblical commentaries, see Talmage (1975). This Provencal scholar, David Qimhi, was thÃ¨ son of Joseph Qimhi (b. ca. 1105, d. ca. 1170), a grammarian, ex- egete, apologete, and poet, who left Andalusia in thÃ¨ 114OS (as an effect of thÃ¨ Almohad conquest, which because of thÃ¨ intolerance of thÃ¨ new rulers was a disaster for thÃ¨ Jews of thÃ¨ region), and set- tled in Narbonne. 5 We provide a discussion of thÃ¨ thÃ¨ Provencal Jewish scholar Ger- sonides, Le., Levi ben Gershom (1288-1344), in Appendix A.</page><page sequence="3">GHASTLY REPRESENTATIONS IN FOLKLORE, I 135 he had daimed that thÃ¨ Tera- phim were shaped like a hu- man body (thÃ¨ proof being that Michal had placed them in David s bed), and that their magie consisted in attracting supernal forces. Yet, David Qimhi to / Sam~ uel, 19:13 also mentions other opinions. He rejects thÃ¨ view according to which thÃ¨ Tera- phim were idols (Rachel stole Labans idols so thÃ¨ object of his idolatry be removed), be- cause he, David Qimhi, finds it unacceptable that David had idols at home; he also mentions an interpretation, by which thÃ¨ Teraphim were a copper-made clock which was also used as an astrological instrument, "and this is possible concerning La- ban, but concerning Michal it is difficult to explain why she put them in bed in David's piace, whereas that instrument is not with such a feature"6. In addition, it is difficult to see how, if thÃ¨ Teraphim were a severed head (which is an interpretation that nei- ther Gersonides, nor David Qimhi mentions, as far as I know), Michal could effec- tively replace them for David in bed, as thÃ¨ body would stili be missing, and thÃ¨ bed would look empty. 3. The child prodigy and thÃ¨ skull: an early modern Maharal narrative literarized by Ben Yechezkel Further to thÃ¨ considera- tions made by Sperber, and to these further remarks I have made here, also note that thÃ¨ severed head of a person being interrogated by a pagan sect turns up in a Jewish folktale which, in a literarized form, was induded in Ben Yechezkel (1957/8, repr. 5737 = 1976/7, voi. 3, pp. 92-100. As found there, thÃ¨ tale is given thÃ¨ ti- tle GulgÃ³let ha-IllÃ¹y ( The Skull of thÃ¨ Prodigy Child), and an old-fashioned note placed un- der thÃ¨ title informs that thÃ¨ events related took piace at thÃ¨ times of thÃ¨ famous Mahar- al of Prague, on whom, see in Appendix B. On p. 420, Ben Yechezkel indicates his source as being thÃ¨ book Pe er mi-Qdoshim (['Magnificence from Saints'] Lemberg [= Lwow], 1865). He then proceeds to enumerate sources in ancient and more recent rabbinic texts (especial- ly in relation to thÃ¨ Teraphim), and provides citations for par- allels in international folklore. Rather than delving into these, let us consider Ben YechezkePs version. A great merchant in Prague, who is a learned Jew, has a child prodigy who is a pupil of Maharal. A marriage is soon arranged for thÃ¨ boy. By de- ception, thÃ¨ boy is taken away from his family, and led into a tower, where, as he longs for books so he could study, he is dosed by his captors inside a room tuli of books. Then a skull (or a mummifÃ-ed talk- ing head: Ben Yechezkel is am- biguous concerning which is what) talks up and warns thÃ¨ child. The talking head commiser- ates with thÃ¨ captured boy, ex- plains thÃ¨ situation, and pro- poses a pian for escape. He, too, had been a Jewish child prodigy. The captors are from a Gentile sect7 that every eighty years (once thÃ¨ powers of thÃ¨ previous talking head are de- pleted) capture such a child, kill him, and by magical means (placing a magical formula un- der his tongue) cause his head to become a talking tool which they worship (thÃ¨ talking head refers to thÃ¨ candles lit in his honour inside thÃ¨ room), and which they can interrogate, and then thÃ¨ head is forced to give them accurate answers. To avoid such a fate, thÃ¨ living child must flee from thÃ¨ window, and moreover, thÃ¨ talking head must leave with him, lest it be questioned by thÃ¨ captors, upon which it would be forced to advise them about how to capture thÃ¨ boy again.8 As to thÃ¨ features of thÃ¨ victims, no mention of redness is made. Rather, they are child prodigies, and they each are a firstborn, thÃ¨ son of a firstborn, whereas thÃ¨ sacri- fice (apparently consisting of decapitation) takes piace when thÃ¨ boy s age is thirteen years and one day.9 The talking head instruets thÃ¨ boy to flee from thÃ¨ win- dow on thÃ¨ night of his thir- teenth birthday: he is to hold thÃ¨ magical head, that would enable him to fly away. The talking head has thÃ¨ boy take an oath, that he would give thÃ¨ severed head a proper Jew- ish burial, and would recite thÃ¨ kaddish prayer for thÃ¨ deceased afterwards. 6 The feature tekhunÃ  of being so shaped, as to enable thÃ¨ de- ception. 7 This is an example of inter- denominational mistrust that presents thÃ¨ Other, or rather, some within thÃ¨ Other, as de- monic. Imagining thÃ¨ Other as monstruously abject is, of course, a kind of prejudice of which thÃ¨ Jews in Europe have greatly sufFered over thÃ¨ cen- turies (and which, some main- tain, stili shapes some percep- tions of Jewish statehood, as though it must per force be characterized by what thÃ¨ Span- ish language terms thÃ¨ judia- da, for a 'monstruous wicked deecT). In Part II, we consider how Anglo-Saxon Protestant anti-Catholic polemic also pro- duced demonizing narratives, and, in particular, we discuss a nasty cartoon by Thomas Nast (New York, 1871), about Catho- lic education, in which thÃ¨ chil- dren were presented as though they were being sacrifÃ-ced to crocodile-bishops in New York City, with thÃ¨ tide of thÃ¨ car- toon implying that child sacri- fices to crocodiles were current on thÃ¨ River Ganges. 8 This is also why, according to thÃ¨ tradition analysed by Sper- ber, Rachel stole Labans Tera- phim before Jacob s household fled. 9 The age of thirteen is thÃ¨ ca- nonical age for thÃ¨ religious ma- jority of male Jewish children (thÃ¨ time when thÃ¨ Bar-Mitz- vah ceremony, basically equiva- lent to thÃ¨ Catholic First Com- munion, usually takes piace). For girls, thÃ¨ age is twelve.</page><page sequence="4">136 EPHRAIM NISSAN Meanwhile, as thÃ¨ child is missing and no news can be had by his parents, also his teacher, thÃ¨ famous Maharal, becomes concerned; he prays, and is su- pernaturally informed about thÃ¨ danger in which thÃ¨ boy has found himself. Maharal prays, and on thÃ¨ Ã¨ve of thÃ¨ boy s es- cape Maharal prodaims a pub- lic fast in Prague. Psalms are read, thÃ¨ shofar (thÃ¨ ram horn) is blown, and finally thÃ¨ boy ar- rives flying through a window into thÃ¨ synagogue. The child relates that before his flight, he had a dream,10 in which his grandfather instruct- ed him to hold his belt, so he could fly away with him. Then, once he awoke, he actually flew out of thÃ¨ window in thÃ¨ tower by holding thÃ¨ talking skull - that by now can no longer talk, but as it contained thÃ¨ magical device which would have en- abled thÃ¨ magicians to reiter- ate thÃ¨ process with some oth- er victim, Maharal removes thÃ¨ device (a formula inscribed on paper or parchment) from in- side thÃ¨ skull and tears it in- to pieces, there is a happy end to thÃ¨ story, to thÃ¨ extent that a story which ends in a funer- al (for thÃ¨ boy murdered eighty years before) could be said to have a happy end. At any rate, it ends in relief". 4. A paradox about boundarÃ-es: An efFect of oikotypization? It is paradoxical - it could be considered a flaw of thÃ¨ narra- tive indeed - that thÃ¨ father was so easily duped into entrusting his son with thÃ¨ magicians pos- turing as merchants. He doesn't even accompany them, yet thÃ¨ prospect is a wedding. Arguably there is much more to this than a reflection of thÃ¨ practices for arranged marriage for children. There is a more fundamental issue: thÃ¨ telos of thÃ¨ folktale, along with its message about thÃ¨ availabil- ity of supernal help for some who are especially deserving, and about thÃ¨ stature of thÃ¨ Maharal of Prague as an agent or conduit for such help to be given, is quite clearly about thÃ¨ chilling threat from thÃ¨ out- side of thÃ¨ community. Yet thÃ¨ father readily entered into an agreement with thÃ¨ ma- gicians who were posturing as unobjectionable members of thÃ¨ ingroup. This can be ex- plained out by hearing in mind that non maintenance of thÃ¨ boundary in a detail of a sto- ry (which is surprising in a sto- ry that is as eminently about boundary maintenance as this one) sometimes occurs in Jew- ish folktales as thÃ¨ result of thÃ¨ adoption of a thematic series (a story, or a subnarrative with- in it) from thÃ¨ repertoire of in- ternational folklore, by making this borrowed narrative fit with- in thÃ¨ oikotype of thÃ¨ given cul- ture at thÃ¨ receiving end.12 In thÃ¨ case at hand, thÃ¨ ad- aptation may have involved thÃ¨ child being entrusted to his soon to become father-in- law (or to an emissary) rath- er than through some differ- ent narrative device, as well as thÃ¨ child being characterized as a child prodigy, as thÃ¨ Jew- ish oikotype prizes learning: perhaps a gentile version of thÃ¨ story had a young prince or noble youngster, instead. It is less cogent that thÃ¨ in- ternational type featured a wondrous child, who in this story is powerless instead of powerful. The other child prodigy, thÃ¨ one who met a dire end eighty years earlier, underwent a transformation in thÃ¨ sense of Vladimit Propp s (1928) functions. The flying skull is in a helper role, but thÃ¨ two characters' success in escaping depends (at least in part) on their joining forces. 5. The fallacy of thÃ¨ image in thÃ¨ negative In thÃ¨ folktale we have been considering, which is about thÃ¨ threat posed by a malevolent and powerful Other, one thing that stands out is thÃ¨ presump- tion that thÃ¨ magicians (thÃ¨ bad guys in thÃ¨ story) are after, of ali things, Jewish child prod- igies, Le., children who not on- ly are Jewish, but have both a demonstrated excellent record and a dear potential in Jewish religious learning. Such a presumption entails that thÃ¨ enemy - while at thÃ¨ opposite end of thÃ¨ scale of values and of thÃ¨ spectrum of identities vis-a-vis thÃ¨ collec- tive Self to whose members this folktale was intended to cater - does acknowledge as a source of supernal power pre- cisely such elements that are extolled by thÃ¨ religious iden- tity of thÃ¨ collective Self of this narrative s oikotype. 10 This part of thÃ¨ story incor- porates yet another motif - thÃ¨ dream - that is not infre- quent in thÃ¨ international folk- tale, and in thÃ¨ Jewish folktale in particular. 11 Sometimes one finds a report about mirades performed by thÃ¨ head of a beheded saintly man. Sindawi (2003) discusses such a tradition from Shi'ite Is- lamic hagiography, concerning Husayn ibn 'Ali, that religioni arch-martyr. Sindawi (2007) compares that role in Shi'ism and Christianity. 12 Either a thematic series may occur in variants in different cultural contexts, or then they may be just a shared motif, or rather, more abstractly, a mo- tifeme - a concept introduced by Alan Dundes (1962, repr. 1975), and for which Lubomir Dolezel (1972) provided an im- portant discussion - which can be customized as a motif in thÃ¨ given environment. The environment in which thÃ¨ adaptation takes piace is known by thÃ¨ name oikotype or oicotype or oecotype, thÃ¨ concept and thÃ¨ term having been introduced by Von Sydow (1948). In a structuralist perspective, a motifeme stands to a motif as a phoneme stands to a phonet- ic value, and so forth; Le., they respectively are an ernie unit (more abstract), and an etic unit (made concrete within partic- ular contextual conditions). In fact, Dundes titled his paper "From etic to ernie units in thÃ¨ structural study of folktales".</page><page sequence="5">GHASTLY REPRESENTATIONS IN FOLKLORE, I 137 To say it plainly, a Jewish child prodigy is thÃ¨ necplus ul- tra not only to his own com- munity, but also to an imag- ined very dangerous enemy of that community, and if this is thÃ¨ case, it must be because that enemy acknowledges thÃ¨ truth of thÃ¨ faith of that com- munity, while combating it. Such an image in thÃ¨ nega- tive, which precisely because it is in a sense specular, is utter evil, is part and parcel of thÃ¨ de- monization of thÃ¨ Other in an- other egregious example from thÃ¨ folklore of another denomi- national identity: thÃ¨ one of thÃ¨ host community with respect to European Jewry.13 Namely, this is thÃ¨ case of thÃ¨ medieval libel of thÃ¨ desecration of thÃ¨ Host, levelled against thÃ¨ Jews since thÃ¨ Middle Ages in West- ern Christianity.14 Supposedly, they would surreptitiously obtain physical possession of thÃ¨ Host, then stab it, causing it to bleed.15 Red stains were detected on thÃ¨ Host.16 The logicai falla- cy of thÃ¨ claim of thÃ¨ desecra- tion of thÃ¨ Host is that it as- sumes that thÃ¨ Jews believe in thÃ¨ Eucharist. The point is that not only they dont, but what is more, thÃ¨ Eucharist is not even an item conceptualized in their culture. Their own belief System is not thÃ¨ image in thÃ¨ negative of thÃ¨ belief System of their accusers. It can be said that in thÃ¨ folktale about thÃ¨ child prod- igy we have been discussing, thÃ¨ enemy likewise displays thÃ¨ chimaera of a reversed, yet iso- morphic belief System, at any rate when it comes to placing any value on a child superbly proficient in Jewish learning. In a folklore perspective, such reversals arguably fulfil a function. Ascribed acknowl- edgement by an enemy (an imaginary enemy, as in this folktale) provides confÃ-rma- tion. If thÃ¨ enemy seeks con- trol of something that pecu- liarly thÃ¨ oikotype values, then this is taken to validate thÃ¨ val- ue thÃ¨ culture places on it. 6. Possible environmental influences: thÃ¨ unburied within thÃ¨ sacred in thÃ¨ hosting outgroup As mentioned earlier, Ben Yechezkel cited both thÃ¨ textual sources for thÃ¨ thematic series, and scholarly literature (from thÃ¨ late i9th and early 2Oth cen- turies) that deals with it in a folklore studies perspective. Rather that taking that way, it would be perhaps more use- ful here to provide thÃ¨ fol- lowing remarks. One may speculate whether, for a story like thÃ¨ one drawn from Ben Yechezkel, as well as, perhaps, for thÃ¨ further evolution of thÃ¨ tradition about thÃ¨ Teraphim and thÃ¨ shaping of thÃ¨ Jewish versions of thÃ¨ tale in medieval and early modern Europe, any impact can be ascribed to per- ceptions of thÃ¨ cult of saints* relics (unburied body remains, 13 One must bear in mind that for about one millennium, Jews were thÃ¨ only tolerated different reli- gious group in Christian Europe, and this was because Augustine of Hippo saw them (by interpreting in a peculiar manner Psalms 59:12) in thÃ¨ role of thÃ¨ wretched wit- nesses of thÃ¨ Ecclesia Triumphans. They were to be tolerated, but not encouraged. This was a viable situation for survival, unlike thÃ¨ harsher stance advocated by Duns Scotus, who maintained that ali that was required was that there would be a remnant of thÃ¨ Jews, and that no matter how small that remnant was, it was desirable that it would be further reduced to an even smaller remnant. Duns Sco- tus' stance justified thÃ¨ expulsion of thÃ¨ Jews from England. Euro- pean attitudes were swinging be- tween these two views, and during thÃ¨ 2Oth century this continued in a secularized form. 14 In Italian folklore, a variant of this myth is known as II fritto dell'Ebrea, and at any rate this is thÃ¨ name under which literature making that charge was dissemi- nateci by thÃ¨ bishopric of Oria as late as thÃ¨ second half of thÃ¨ 2Oth century, as pointed out by thÃ¨ late Alfonso Di Noia (1973). CaliÃ² (2007, p. 201) relates about thÃ¨ re- vival in thÃ¨ early 1970S of thÃ¨ myth of thÃ¨ desecration of thÃ¨ Host, and of a related procession in thÃ¨ town of Trani, by thÃ¨ archbishop of Tra- ni. CaliÃ² (ibid., p. 210, nn. 87, 88) cites Lo Presti (1975), Di Noia (1975), and thÃ¨ reply to thÃ¨ latter by Archbishop Carata (1975). 15 At thÃ¨ Galleria nazionale in Urbino, there is a predella (aitar step) painted by Paolo Uccello, and depicting in six scenes thÃ¨ Profana- zione dell'ostia. The fÃ-rst scene shows a woman making a deal with a Jew. The second scene shows thÃ¨ Jew and his family desecrating thÃ¨ Host that thÃ¨ woman has stolen from a church, but a mob is about to either tear down, or simply open thÃ¨ door. In thÃ¨ third scene, thÃ¨ miraculous Host is carried in pro- cession. In thÃ¨ fourth scene, horse- men and an executioner stand to- gether with thÃ¨ guilty Christian woman under a tree, on which a ladder is leaning; she is about to be hanged, but she is pardoned, while an angel flies above thÃ¨ oth- er characters. In thÃ¨ fifth scene, thÃ¨ Jew and his family are burnt at thÃ¨ stake. In thÃ¨ sixth scene, angels and devils contend thÃ¨ corpse of thÃ¨ Christian woman, who meanwhile has passed away. 16 Red stains on bread are due to bacteria of thÃ¨ species Monas pro- digiosa, discovered by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, who report- ed about it in 1848 in a commu- nication to thÃ¨ Academy of Sci- ence of Berlin. This is thÃ¨ scientif- ic explanation for what had trig- gered thÃ¨ libel of thÃ¨ desecration of thÃ¨ Host. During thÃ¨ siege of Tyre by Alex- ander thÃ¨ Great, "bloocT stains on bread were considered by thÃ¨ besiegers to be a bad omen, but a priest, Aristander, convinced them that thÃ¨ omen was bad for thÃ¨ besieged, because thÃ¨ stains were found inside thÃ¨ bread, not on thÃ¨ outside (Sagredo 1961, pp. 364-365).</page><page sequence="6">138 EPHRAIM NISSAN or ones enclosed inside reli- quaries) in other co-territorial denominations. This does not appear to have necessarily been an in- fluential factor. Nevertheless, as we are going to see in thè next section, there was an in- direct, tortuous link. Consider that reliquaries can be various- ly shaped. It is a silver-made container, shaped like a head17 with a staring face, in thè case of thè "testa reliquiario di S. Amico", in thè church of St. Amicus (Sant'Amico) in San Pietro Avellana, in thè Alto Molise region of Italy. Actu- ally, it is sometimes referred to as being a "testa argentata". It was made by some silversmith from Sulmona, in thè late 14A century. Head reliquaries are thè subject of Appendix C. Mummies aren't unheard of, either. In thè 1976 film Ca- daveri eccellenti - directed by Francesco Rosi, and based on a novel by Leonardo Sciascia, // contesto - an initial episode shows an aged police chief in- spector while he visits thè crypt beneath a church, and stares in silence at several real mummi- fied corpses which stand there (such an environment exists independently of thè filming). After thè old man leaves thè church, he is murdered. When that strange scene in thè crypt has been described by film crit- ics, it was interpreted as though he was silently questioning thè mummies. It wasn't taken to be equivalent to his, say, visit- ing thè zoo so he could reflect calmly18. 7. The Baphomet of thè Knights Templare There is more to say about possible influences. In Section 4, we proposed that thè folk- tale about thè child prodigy who is saved from thè fate of his predecessor, turned up in East European Jewish folklore (specifically, in thè Maharal cy- cle) by adaptation to thè Jew- ish oikotype of a thematic se- ries originating elsewhere in in- ternational folklore. It is quite possible that we may be able to pinpoint a precise origin. In thè Jewish folktale, thè kidnappers are a sect of ma- gicians, whose ways are clan- destine. Perhaps thè same was thè case in a preceding Gentile version of thè tale: thè child may have been noble, rather 17 The human head has an impor- tant symbolic value, in human cultures (Blakemore and Jennett 2001, Corbin et al. 2005). Hab- lot (2008) discusses thè image of thè head of thè King in medieval politicai discourse in France. As to beheadings, Janes (2005) deals with their cultural and literary representations, from scafFold dra- mas to beheadings in thè colonies. As to Jewish culture, thè essays in Eilberg-Schwartz (1992) are con- cerned with thè role of thè body. Specific parts of thè human face, too, have received attention in thè scholarly literature, e.g., thè nose (de Rijke et al. 2001). In thè tale we have analysed, thè head of thè kidnapped boy is of interest to his kidnappers because of his intellectual power in holy matters. It is this that gives value to his head and talking mouth, it- self necessary for communication. The kidnappers are conceived of as magicians, a kind of hostile Oth- er that nevertheless is aware of thè value of those it attacks. Yet, there are other hostile Other s perspec- tives on Jews* human body, and such negative views have been sometimes internalized by some Jews, in thè modern era (e.g., Gil- man 1994, 1996). 18 Having mentioned Italian cine- ma, consider that thè famous actor Ugo Tognazzi (1922-1990) pub- lished a detective story, Kuatter contro Kuatter (i.e., Lombard for 'Four Against Four': Tognazzi was born in Cremona) as a supplement to thè weekly Panorama. ("Allega- to a Panorama numero y66-j6yny which should be sufficient, but no explicit date of publication is giv- en in thè booklet.) On p. 11, thè text relates that in- side a theatre, thè actor Luxman is about to utter Hamlet s mono- logue, holding thè skull. "La fan- tasia del grande Shakespeare mai avrebbe previsto che il teschio potesse esplodere. Beh, quella sera avvenne e Luxman non potè ter- minare il monologo in quanto de- capitato dallo scoppio. Nella sala si scatenò il panico." - "The imag- ination of thè great Shakeaspeare would never have foreseen that thè skull could explode. Well, on that evening it happened, and Luxman was unable to conclude thè mon- ologue, because thè blast decapi- tateci him. In thè hall, people were taken by panie." Even though thè blast was confined to thè stage, thè public rushes to thè exits. "E qui sarà bene sorvolare sull'increscioso comportamento di note personal- ità della cultura e della politica." ("Let us ignore thè shameful be- haviour of well-known literati and politicians.") In this episode, thè protagonist loses his head precisely because he is deal- ing with a skull: thè goal of killing him succeeds, because he was hold- ing thè skull. By contrast, in thè folktale from thè Maharal cyde, thè child prodigy avoids beheading pre- cisely because he was able to com- municate with a divinatory skull, or rather an embalmed head. Vittorio Luxman, who does both serious plays and comedy, is a dis- guise for real-life actor Vittorio Gassman. In thè plot, Luxman s death follows thè sudden violent death of two comedians (one falls into thè well of a lift, thè oth- er one is electrocuted by a cof- fee-vending machine). The detec- tive, who is an unnamed profes- sor, witnessed thè blast that kills Luxman. He later intervenes and saves actor Ugo Strapazzi (a dis- guise for Tognazzi). By then, thè reader is made to understand that up to that point thè story was a parody (ludic transformation) of thè whodunit genre, and that thè episode when thè mysteries are solved is an out and out travesty (a satirical transformation, here stylistically cast as a farce). Each murder was perpetrated by a dif- ferent second-rate actor. With seven rivals either dead or arrest- ed, Strapazzi savours his being thè only comedian remaining around. He was thè one who had sent four anonymous letters, inspiring ad- dressees to murder rivals. Appar- ently Tognazzi was inspired, for his alter ego's role as head of a conspiracy, by thè parodie period- ical II Male portraying Tognazzi as head of thè Red Brigades. (This is mentioned in a biosketch follow- ing thè story, and Strapazzi was previously wrongly arrested for something similar.)</page><page sequence="7">GHASTLY REPRESENTATIONS IN FOLKLORE, I 139 than a child prodigy, and his father, a nobleman, may have trusted some men because of their social standing. These men were acting as a knight- ly order, and were secretly in- volved in initiatic activities of a creepy nature. European history has an event, that may have caused such a notion to develop: a co- hesive group of people who were trusted by thè nobility, yet were eventually found (so it was alleged) to have been acting out horrific mysteries. The event was thè Templar tri- als. These are now usually con- sidered to have been one of thè many sins of King Philippe IV thè Fair.19 On 13 October 1307, this king had ali Knights Tem- plars arrested. The men them- selves were tortured, tried and condemned. Many were exe- cuted. The quite considerable assets of thè knights were con- fiscated. In 1312, Pope Clem- ent V acceded to thè request of thè King of France, and abol- ished thè knightly order of thè Templare. One of thè charges made against thè Templare while on trial was idoltary. In particular, it was alleged that they adored and used to kiss a bearded head. This was called Baphomet. The Knight Templar Raynier de Larchant, under interrogation on 20 October 1307, daimed he had seen thè Baphomet a doz- en times. It was variously de- scribed, in thè trial proceedings. Allegedly, its eyes were made of carbunde, thus, as a precious garnet, a deep red gem. Suppos- edly, it was kept at thè Knights Templare' Temple in Paris. What were thè Templare ac- tually doing, while venerating (did they?) a sculpted head? One comes across an interpre- tation that makes sense: it ei- ther was a sculpted head, or, more specifically, a head reli- quary, or a preserved human head. The prosecutions interpre- tation of thè Baphomet as be- ing thè head of thè Devii, or an idol, suited thè purpose of finding them guilty. The name Baphomet that was ascribed to that head is usually assumed now that this was a variant of Mahomet, just as a form of thè term Mahomeries was Bapho- meris, applied to mosques. An effect of thè trials was thè pro- liferation of a kind of gargoyle in France: a sculpted demon- ic figure (rather than just thè head), also called Baphomet. It is a bearded, androginous dev- ii, horned, winged, and sport- ing daws, as found on thè por- tals of thè churches of Saint- Merry in Paris and of Sainte- Craix in Provins. In Italy, such a sculpted image (called Bafo- metto) is found in a grotto near Padua, called thè Grotta dei Cavalieri Templari.™ What really may solve our puzzle, is that by one (presum- ably legendary) account, thè Knights Templari Baphom- et was thè head of a man, em- balmed with herbs and spic- es, and interrogated as an ora- de. This is thè missing link, to- wards a Gentile version of thè folktale whose Jewish oikotyp- ization we have been analysing in this artide. Perhaps thè historical Knights Templare had a special veneration for a head reliquary, thus, with positive connota- tions as found by devouts' at- titudes to reliquaries in main- stream Catholicism (see Ap- pendix C). The effect of thè Templar trials was that thè par- ticular head reliquary that thè Templars had been venerat- ing, carne to be deemed to be a demonic implement: a head- reliquary, but in thè negative, thus, an idolatrous and dia- bolical head. One further stage was to consider that head to possess real magie properties, of an oracular nature. The step til Richelieu, that a crypto-Jew- ish community of refugees from Spain carne to be tolerated in prac- tice, in order to spite Spain and deny thè Spanish Inquisition thè right to intervene on French ter- ritory.) Italian Jews remember thè expulsion of thè Jews from France as thè event that eventually gave rise to Piedmontese Jewry. 20 Present-day popularistic treat- ments of thè Knights Templars and of thè Baphomet are them- selves of interest to folklore stud- ies, but outside our present scope. One thread relates thè Baphomet to thè Holy Graal, whereas anoth- er thread relates it to theTurin Sin- done (thè Holy Shroud), thè latter being related by some devotees to thè Templars anyway (see thè web- pages bafometto.htm and sacra_sindone.htm at thè site http://www.templaricavalieri.it/) . Like in New Age ideologies, some bizarre hypotheses about thè Tem- plars are made in ali seriousness by Templar devotees, and for thè interested scholar thè best course of action would be to analyse this within a folklore studies approach to present-day popular culture. 19 The nickname le Beau in French and thè Fair in English is associat- ed with thè name of Philippe IV, King of France (b. 1268, r. 1285, d. 1314). He is referred to as 'Fair' with reference to his looks, not to his behaviour, which is widely per- ceived as having been grossly un- fair for various reasons. Catholic Italians mainly associate him with thè Insult of Anagni, to which Pope Boniface Vili was subjected on orders of this king: on 7 Sep- tember 1303, thè Pope was arrested in thè town of Anagni by Sciarra Q&gt;lonna and Guillaume of Noga- ret, who acted on orders from thè King of France. Philippe IV ob- tained in 1309 from Pope Clem- ent V that thè headquarters of thè Papacy be transferred from Rome to Avignon, and this is anoth- er reason for displeasure for Ital- ians, who have long considered thè "Avignonese Captivity ' to be as lamentable as thè biblical "Bab- ylonian Captivity". Jewish history associates thè same king with thè expulsion of thè Jews from France. He chased thè Jews out of France, then called them back for a hefty sum, only to chase them again, de- finitively. (It would only be un-</page><page sequence="8">I4O EPHRAIM NISSAN was conceptually short towards thè Jewish version of die tale. Thus, it is true that thè Jew- ish folktale of thè kidnapped child, from thè Maharal cy- cle, was ultimately based on a Catholic head-reliquary, but it hadn t been thè Jewish oiko- type that had reversed its cul- tural connotation from positive to negative. The negative value had been bestowed already in some quarters whose allegiance was to mainstream Catholi- cism, because this was thè head venerated by thè Knights Tem- plars, who had themselves had a reversai of fortune: from val- iant knights of Christendom, into reprobates, utter villains exposed by Philippe IV thè Fair, King of France. (That by doing so, he had enriched him- self, just as he did by extortion from France s expelled Jews, was not in his time and age an aetiology to be entertained by dominan t rethoric).21 As thè military and religious Order of thè Poor Knights of Christ had risen to wealth and power in thè affairs of Europe because it had attracted men of noble birth and wealth, thè proposai we made in Section 4, that thè child prodigy of thè Jewish tale had originally been a noble young man in a gentile source, is confirmed. This may explain out why he had been entrusted with thè men who turned out to be magicians. By contrast, especially con- sidering that thè Jewish tale is part of thè Maharal cycle, it makes no sense that a mar- riage would have been ar- ranged for thè boy without his father getting reasonable assurances as to thè identity of thè in-laws. What is more, thè boy is being sent away without any relatives accom- panying him: weren't they to prepare a wedding? And there is more to it; thè historical Maharal, as being a rabbi, tried to curb a worrying phenomenon he had observed in Prague: namely, there was an overly emphasis on geneal- ogy, and unwarranted asper- sions cast on a family would sometimes taint it into unmar- riageability. This is a kind of attitude that Maharal tried to counteract. In a society that placed such a value on blame- less genealogy, thè arranged marriage from thè folktale we have been considering is not credible. But then, thè histor- ical Maharal has little to do with thè Maharal of folklore. 8. A variant from science fiction of thè tale The theme of thè story of which we considered Ben Yechezkel s version, with thè detail about thè talking head being replaced every eighty years as its powers are depleted, is curiously similar to a centrai notion in a particular episode of thè science fiction televi- sion series Star Trek. Mr. Spock was captured by thè rulers of a planet, who took out his brain and planted it at thè core of a computer System that controls thè physical functioning of that planetary environment. A new brain has to be re- placed for thè old one every 10,000, and once Mr. Spocks companions arrive into thè con- trol room, Mr. Spocks brain, talking with Mr. Spocks voice from inside thè computer, ex- plains that thè experience of his new situation is very tiresome and unpleasant, yet he despairs of their attempt to save him turning out to be other than fu- tile. Captain Kirk nevertheless takes Spocks' brain out of thè computer, and puts it back in- side Spocks body, just in time before such surgery could no longer take piace. One could easily consider this particular science fiction narrative to be no less an insult to intelligence than thè partic- ular horror story of old is, yet thematically they exhibit in- teresting shared features, that deserve to be remarked about. The viewpoint of internation- al folklore is all-important, for making sense of such stories. It is quite possible that thè script of that Star Trek episode was invented from scratch, based on thè notion that a nat- urai brain is more efficient than a computer System, and also on thè poetic convention that ex- trapolations into thè future of 1960S and 197OS Western tech- nology could be applied to sup- posed civilizations from out- er space. Yet thè resemblance to thè story of thè child prod- igy skulls being replaced eve- ry eighty years, for purposes that pertain to what in current parlance we would term "brain power", cannot be discounted.22 Therefore, it is certainly val- id to point out thè taxonomical affinity of thè two stories. This " Could thè Templare' venerat- ed head be interpreted against thè backdrop of thè promi- nence (itself discussed by Ha- blot 2008) of thè head of thè King in medieval politicai dis- course in France? Reinach (1911) related thè Baphomet to thè myth of Perseus and Medu- sa, through a tale set in Byzan- tium. See our inset 'More on thè Baphomet' on p. 143 (in thè notes column). " Spock is thè "brainy ' char- acter in thè dramatis personae from thè spaceship upon whose adventures thè Star Trek series revolves. (Spocks ancestry isnt entirely human, either, but is part human, and part outer space humanoid alien.) The task of Spocks brain at thè core of thè machine, in thè giv- en episode after thè brain was taken out of Spock's body, is well beyond its normal tasks: it controls (in thè cybernetic sense) a planetary System for thè benefit of thè civilization that abducted Spock. Spock's tone of voice when his brain speaks out from inside thè ma- chine when Captain Kirk ar- rives, conveys dire sufferance that supplements thè contents of what he is saying. Likewise, thè severed head of thè child prodigy is to carry out divinatory tasks by magie, thus, something that thè child prodigy in his normal life could not perform, and its thè magi- cians' magie that would enable thè severed head to perform for his abduetors' benefit, whereas thè situation of thè murdered child is unpleasant. The reward for thè child murdered by thè magicians eighty years earlier, is that he gets a proper Jewish fu- neral, and is no longer captive to magie, being able to enter af- terlife like other well-behaved deceased people.</page><page sequence="9">GHASTLY REPRESENTATIONS IN FOLKLORE, I H* does not mean they descend from each other, or that they both are correlated by common ancestry in some given type from international folklore.23 9. Ben Yechezkels styilistic means for referring to thÃ¨ Teraphim, in thÃ¨ story about thÃ¨ flying skull Ben Yechezkels wording, in his version of thÃ¨ story about thÃ¨ child prodigy saved by thÃ¨ flying skull, not only mentions thÃ¨ Teraphim explicitly, but moreover is allusive (because of thÃ¨ co-occurring wording in thÃ¨ short context) to bei in thÃ¨ Hebrew Bible where thÃ¨ Tera- phim are mentioned. The art of thÃ¨ magicians is described by reference to knowledge of thÃ¨ Teraphim, but also of thÃ¨ priestly Ephod, thus thÃ¨ word- ing results in an intertextu- al reference to Judges, 17:5 (cf. Hosbea, 3:4). Whereas thÃ¨ Ephod was part of thÃ¨ dress of thÃ¨ penta- teuchal High Priest, thÃ¨ He- brew Bible also refers to an ephod being made in thÃ¨ serv- ice of some pagan or at any rate disapproved cult (Judges, iy:$9 18:14-20 and 8:27). There- fore, in referring to thÃ¨ Ephod, Ben Yechezkel literary oper- ation - as condueted on his folkloric material which por- trays the/some Other as ex- tremely dangerous - did so by recyding cultural items in a manner comprehensible with- in thÃ¨ culture itself. APPENDIXA On Gersonides' way with exegesis.Two examples about Elijah biblical narratives Gersonides, i.e., Levi ben Gershom (1288-1344), is also known by thÃ¨ names Leo He- braeus, and Maestre Leo de Bagnols24. In a rather popularistic paper (actually, a keynote speech ad- dressing an audience of astron- omers), Gersonides' scholarly achievements have been sum- marized thus (Ne'eman 1983): As a mathematician, he redis- covered [sic] thÃ¨ law of sines and published a sine table, correct to thÃ¨ 5th decimai. As an astronomer (he wrote 136 "chapters"!), he is thÃ¨ first to have relied on his own obser- vations (in his studies of edips- es) rather than on Ptolemys. He invented "Jacobs staff', a navigational instrument which was widely used for 3 centu- ries, and was thÃ¨ first person known to have used a Camera Obscura for his observations. Rabbi Levi is also thÃ¨ first sci- entist to derive more realistic estimates of thÃ¨ distance to thÃ¨ fixed stars. Ptolemys estimate was of thÃ¨ order of io"5 light years (a million times smaller than thÃ¨ distance to thÃ¨ near- er star), whereas Rabbi Levi reached a figure of about io5 light years, io times our present estimate for thÃ¨ distance to an average star in thÃ¨ Galaxy. Let us consider an example of how Gersonides related Ca- naanite practices to astronomy. In iKings, 18:23, Elijah pro- poses thÃ¨ mode of his contest against thÃ¨ 450 priests of Baal, and in particular he specifies that two parim (bulls) should be allocated, that thÃ¨ priests of Baal should choose one par (bull), dissect it, piace it upon thÃ¨ wood, but not set fire, and that likewise he, Elijah, should prepare one par and piace it up- on thÃ¨ wood without setting fÃ-re. The next verse explains that thÃ¨ competitore should in- voke their respective deity, and that thÃ¨ deity that would re- spond and light thÃ¨ fire of its sacrifice would prove itself to be thÃ¨ true one. The people agrees. Then, at v. 25, Elijah turns to thÃ¨ priests of Baal, and tells them to be thÃ¨ ones who start, as they are thÃ¨ numerous camp (whereas he is alone). At v. 26, "They took Ã ie par (bull) that he had given to them", prepared it, and invoked Baal from thÃ¨ morning until noon, to no avail. At noon (v. 27) El- ijah mocked them. Then in thÃ¨ afternoon they continued with their invocations, producing wounds to themselves as part of their ritual, apparendy so that Baal would take pity of them: Gersonides interprets both El- ijahs mocking and thÃ¨ priests' behaviour as being motivated by thÃ¨ latters' supposed identi- fication of Baal with Ma'adt'm,15 i.e., thÃ¨ planet Mars, "thÃ¨ Red One". Gersonides daims that Mars was in thÃ¨ constellation of thÃ¨ Lamb, and makes astro- logical considerations; he al- so suggests that thÃ¨ challenge proposed by Elijah to have thÃ¨ sacrifice set alight supernat- urally was attractive to those priests because this was befit- 23 By resorting to a metaphor with biological dassifications, we could say that thÃ¨ typologi- cal affinity of thÃ¨ two narratives is cladistic, rather than phylo- genetic. 24 The derivational morphology of thÃ¨ proper name Mdadim is as thÃ¨ masculine singular forni of thÃ¨ participle of an active conjugation which itself can express a number of verbal as- pects, especially thÃ¨ causative, thÃ¨ factitive, and thÃ¨ inchoa- tive (i.e., becoming), or then, in just a few instances in Bib- lical Hebrew, thÃ¨ expression of a physical feature, namely: lor maqrin, 'horned bull', and ma- fris parsa, 'that has a cleaved hoof. The verbal aspect rele- vant for thÃ¨ derivation of thÃ¨ name Mdadim is either inchoa- tive, or expressing a bodily fea- ture. As a participle, mdadim denotes 'that is becoming red\ But Mars is thÃ¨ Red Planet, rather than becoming red. 25 For studies about thÃ¨ Prov- encal scholar Gersonides, who lived mostly in Orange and was also a scientist, see Freudenthal (1992, 1995), Staub (1982). In thÃ¨ Renaissance, Gersonides was challenged qua scientist in thÃ¨ context of Scriptural exeges- is (Kellner 1976). Also see Sirat et al. (2003), Kellner (1998), Goldstein (1985), Freudenthal and Mancha (2005), Gerson- ides (1866).</page><page sequence="10">142 EPHRAIM NISSAN ring Mayadimy and that moreo- ver thÃ¨ rimai shedding of their own blood that those priests practised was likewise befÃ-t- ting Mdadim. In thÃ¨ event, thÃ¨ priests of Baal are ineffective, whereas next, Elijahs sacrifice is wondrously successful (he had thÃ¨ flesh of thÃ¨ bulls watered, and a ditch dug around thÃ¨ ai- tar and rilied with water, yet thÃ¨ fire that descends upon thÃ¨ ai- tar, consumes both thÃ¨ meat and thÃ¨ water in die ditch). Let us also consider how Gersonides' perspective as a scientist quite possibly made a diflference, in how he inter- preted Elijahs ascent to Heav- en in a chariot guided by an angel. The usuai Jewish and Christian interpretation is that Elijah reached Heaven alive, without experiencing death.26 To Gersonides, thÃ¨ human body could be transported by air, but not kept in thÃ¨ sky per- manently (at 2 Kings 2:1). He daims (/ Kings 17:1) that Elijah was lifted and taken to some unknown piace, where he re- mained alive, as his letter to Je- horam, who reigned later on (2 Chronicles 21:12), refers to sins that Jehoram hadn't commit- ted yet before Elijahs Ascent, and free will prevents foretell- ing them. We fÃ-nd instead another major exegete who deemed thÃ¨ account of Elijahs bodily as- cent to Heaven problematic, which he solved by assuming that Elijahs body was burnt in thÃ¨ process, and that only his soul reached Heaven. Gerson- ides ascribes this to divine will, and does not try to explain why such a positive charac- ter should die such an unusu- al, violent death (even though rabbinic texts sometimes try to conjecture that an event of which thÃ¨ protagonist was a positive biblical character was in retribution for a given sin). It was indeed precisely Dav- id Qimhi, a medieval exegete who wasrÃ- t a scientist (he was a grammarian), who maintained (at 2 King 2:1): And Elijah became spiritual, and thÃ¨ body was consumed in thÃ¨ supernal fire, and each ele- ment went back to its own el- ement. [...] His dothes were consumed in fire as well, except thÃ¨ cloak that fell down, so that Elisha could take it and hit with it thÃ¨ water. [...] Should you say: it wasn t for thÃ¨ ben- efit of Elisha that thÃ¨ cloak fell down, but as he became spirit- ual, thÃ¨ cloak fell off him - If so, why didn t his other dothes also fall down? Yet David Qimhi at 2 Kings 2:1 states, along with this view of his own, also a different, widespread opinion: And thÃ¨ wind of thÃ¨ tempest raised him up from earth in- to thÃ¨ air: just as when it raises light things, likewise it raised him, by God s will, up to thÃ¨ Circle of Fire, and there his dothes were burnt except thÃ¨ cloak, and his flesh and bones were consumed, and thÃ¨ spir- it went back to God who had given it [after Ecclesiastes 12:7]. And thÃ¨ opinion of our mass- es, as well as of our sages, is that God introduced him into thÃ¨ Garden of Eden along with his body, thÃ¨ way Adam was [there] before he sinned, and likewise he introduced Enoch there. And in thÃ¨ Drash [i.e., midrash (homily), it is main- tained in Dvei Eliyahu Zuta 1] that there are ten who entered thÃ¨ Garden of Eden alive. The same commentator, David Qimhi, wrote some- thing relevant in his commen- tary to Isaiah 10:18 (in partic- ular about "from thÃ¨ spirit to thÃ¨ flesh it will consume"), as he contrasta that verse to Isai- ah 37:36, and uses both verses in order to contribute to a dis- cussion in thÃ¨ Babylonian Tal- mud, tractate Sanhedrin, 943.. He maintains that Isaiah 37:36 illustrates a situation (con- cerning thÃ¨ Assyrian camp) in which thÃ¨ soul was burnt, but not thÃ¨ body, whereas in thÃ¨ former verse both were burnt. APPENDIX B On thÃ¨ cyde of legends about thÃ¨ Maharal of Prague - From thÃ¨ Golem, to inspiration from Conan Doyle The historical Rabbi Yehu- da Liwa ben Betzarel, bet- ter known as thÃ¨ Maharal of Prague (b. Poznan, 1512I?], d. Prague 1609), w*s mainly in- volved in homiletics and phi- losophy. Tradition made a mystic out of him, but wheth- er he was involved in mystics is controversial.

In thÃ¨ early 2Oth century, it was a popularistic author of fiction - Rabbi Yehuda Yudel Rosenberg from Poland, even- tually based in Canada, and whose career was in thÃ¨ rabbin- ate27 - who (in a book he pub- lished in 1909) originated thÃ¨ current perception of thÃ¨ Ma- haral in relation to thÃ¨ Golem. In 1909, thÃ¨ year on which R. Yudel Rosenberg moved from Warsaw to Lodz, he pub- lished Niflaot Mah arai mi- Prag ['The Wonders of thÃ¨ Ma- haral of Prague'] (Piotrkow, 1909). In some stories, he even made him into sort of a Sherlock Holmes; it has been pointed out that one such nar- rative was inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle s Purloined Let- ter (Leiman 2002, cf. Segai 1991). Brody (n.d.) states: In 1913, R. Rosenberg pub- lished Choshen Mishpat shel Kohen Gadol [Le., "Ihe Breast- plate of thÃ¨ High Priest'] (Pie- trokow, 1913). This pamphlet consisted of two parts. The first part was from R. Manoah Hendel's sefer (book) Kelai Ha- Mikdash, a treatise devoted to thÃ¨ various utensils that had been in use in theTemple serv- ice in Jerusalem. In his discus- sion of thÃ¨ whereabouts of thÃ¨ utensils that had survived thÃ¨ destruction of thÃ¨ Temple, R. Manoah Hendel incorporat- ed a story as told by thÃ¨ Ma- haral and that thÃ¨ Maharal or- dered that thÃ¨ story be record- ed for ali generations. [fri. 67: See Choshen Mishpat, p. 3.] R. Yudel Rosenberg then said that thÃ¨ second part of thÃ¨ book is a translation from a book by Conan Doyle. [fn. 68: See Choshen Mishpat, p. 5.] Brody (ibid., fn. 66) points out that Rosenberg "surmis- es that this is thÃ¨ same R. Manoah Hendel, who" was a famous rabbinic scholar, was born in Brestitzka, Poland (Volhynia), ca. 1540, and died in Vienna in 1611. In claiming earlier sourc- es than Rosenberg for thÃ¨ as- sociation of Maharal with thÃ¨ Golem - which Brody does in Appendix I to his paper, an ap- pendix titled The Maharal and thÃ¨ Golem' - Brody {ibid., fn. 172) points out: Reference to thÃ¨ Maharal s Go- lem appeared in B. Auerbach, Spinoza, Stuttgart, 1837, voi. 2, pp. 2-3. Two printed referenc- es to thÃ¨ Maharal s Golem ap- peared in 1841. For thÃ¨ non- Jewish reference, see E Klut- schak's "Der Golam des Rab- bi Low," Panorama des Univer- sums 8 (1841), pp. 75fF, reprint- ed in H.J. Kieval, "Pursuing thÃ¨ Golem of Prague: Jewish Culture and thÃ¨ Invention of a Tradition," Modern Judaismy 17 (1997), p. 21-23. For thÃ¨ Jewish reference, see G. Philippson, "Der Golem," Allgemeine Zei- tung des Judenthums 5 (1841), number 44, pp. 629-631. See Leiman, p. 42, n. 34. The artide by Leiman is thÃ¨ one I cited earlier. In fn. 173, Brody states in addition: See also A.M. Tendlau, "Der Golem des Hoch Rabbi LÃ²b," in his Dos Buch der Sagen und Legendenjudischer Vorzeit, Stutt- gart, 1842, pp. 16-18. Inanaddi- tional note on p. 242, Tendlau attests that his knowlege of thÃ¨ Maharal s Golem is based en- tirely upon orai tradition. Segai wrote, in his own ar- tide (1991): Conan Doyle composed a sto- ry entitled "thÃ¨ Jew's Breast- plate" which deals with a ficti- tious theft of thÃ¨ artefact from thÃ¨ British museum. The story was first printed in a magazine in 1899 and subsequently in- duded in a collection entitled "Round thÃ¨ Fire,n published in More on thÃ¨ Baphomet Reinach (1911) remarked that already Raynouard in 1813 would not believe any Baphomet ever existed. Melville (1999) thinks it may have been a head reliquary. She remarks about thÃ¨ erudite sources of thÃ¨ accusation levelled by Philip thÃ¨ Fair through Nogaret. Marillier (1999) explains that thÃ¨ name Baphomet is not found in thÃ¨ trials proceedings; an adjective was ('Baphometic'). Gaucerant of Montpezat avowed he had adored a "Baphometic image". (Bafomet is found in an Occitan poem of 1265; that is for 'Muhammad' is questioned by some: see s.v. Baphomet in thÃ¨ English Wikipedia). Perhaps Magometus in thÃ¨ proceedings referred to Muhammad. Gaucerant s confession must have been false, as it accepted thÃ¨ false myth that Moslems adored images (a myth also found, e.g., in Italian knightly epics as late as thÃ¨ Renaissance). Based on thÃ¨ misconception from thÃ¨ trials, Marillier explains, thÃ¨ name for thÃ¨ head, Baphomet, carne into existence, and was variously etymologized: "Baphe-mÃ©tous, baptÃ¨me de sagesse; Bios-phos- mÃ©tis, vie-lumiÃ¨re-sagesse; Bapho ou Bafo, nom d'un port de Chypre dont le Temple fut trÃ¨s peu de temps le propriÃ©taire; Abufihamat, corruption de l'expression arabe le PÃ©re de la comprÃ©hension , ou encore de l'arabe Ouba el- Phoumet, la bouche du PÃ©re'; etc". (May I add that perhaps only Abu-fihamat makes any sense.) Yet, Marillier explains, there is evidence for thÃ¨ Templare having been in possession of a head, perhaps a reliquary. Marillier proposes that thÃ¨ Templare had an initiatic rite, "de nature hÃ©roÃ-'co-solaire", which at least symbolically replicated an ancient "rite de la tÃ¨te coupÃ©e", known to international folklore. The Baphomet resurfaced in 19th-century occultism, and was depicted as a winged humanoid goat (like thÃ¨ Devilc in tarot cards). In 1996, Revolution Software launched a video game in French, called Les Chevaliers de Baphomet (s.v., in thÃ¨ French Wikipedia). Only thÃ¨ German vereion retains Baphomet in thÃ¨ title (in thÃ¨ U.S., it is Circle ofBlood). Appearances of a Baphomet character in games or films are listed s.v. baphomet' in thÃ¨ French Wikipedia. 27 It was, and is, quite unusu- al for a rabbi to publish adven- ture fiction.</page><page sequence="12">144 EPHRAIM NISSAN 1908. The story is admitted- ly not one of his better known works, and has rarely been re- printed. In 1913, there appeared in Pi- otrkow, Poland, a book enti- tled "Sefer Hoshen ha-Mish- pat shel ha-Kohen ha-Gadol" - "thÃ¨ Book of thÃ¨ High Priest s Breastplate." The Hebrew vol- ume told a story that was vir- tually identical to Conan Doy- le's with one signifÃ-cant dif- ference: thÃ¨ hero was thÃ¨ i6th century Bohemian Rabbi Ju- dah Loew of Prague, better known by his acronym "thÃ¨ Maharal." In thÃ¨ story, thÃ¨ Ma- haral journeys to London in order to solve thÃ¨ mysterious theft of thÃ¨ breast-plate from thÃ¨ "Belmore Street" museum. This statement about thÃ¨ as- sociation of Maharal with thÃ¨ Golem being unknown before Rosenberg introduced it, is in conflict with data in Aaron Brody (supra), who is able to point out secular Jewish as well as non-Jewish texts mention- ing it already in thÃ¨ I9th cen- tury. In particular, thÃ¨ German Jewish writer Berthold Au- erbach (1812-1882) had men- tioned it in his Spinoza. According to Brody's bio- graphical paper, R. Yehuda Yu- del Rosenberg was born on 8 November 1859 in Skaryszew (or Skaraschev), Poland, and in 1913 emigrated from that country to Toronto, Canada. "On Wednesday, February 18, 1931, thÃ¨ Jewish community of Montreal had a banquet, at thÃ¨ Chevra Kadisha28 Synagogue, in honor of Rabbi Jehudah Rosenbergs seventieth birth- day" (Brody, ibid.). He passed away on 23 October 1935. Moshe Idei29 (1996) re- fers to Eli Yassif VÂ° edition (1980/81) of tales by Yehuda Yudel Rosenberg and in partic- ular to thÃ¨ tradition about thÃ¨ Golem which associates it with Prague. Yet, Idei is mainly con- cerned with medieval, Renais- sance, and premodern texts, and therefore thÃ¨ association with Maharal is only perife- ral in Idels book. Moreover, Idei (in thÃ¨ introduction) dis- misses as merely historiosoph- ical (and therefore deprived of philological significance) An- dre Neher s Faust and thÃ¨ Ma- haral of Prague (1987). APPENDIX C Head Reliquaries An example of head reli- quary made in Section 6 is that of St. Amicus, from San Pie- tro Avellana in Molise, Italy.31 Let us consider thÃ¨ typology. The online thesaurus of para- phernalia of Catholic rites de- fines anthropomorphic reliquary as "A reliquary whose shape re- produces thÃ¨ body part that thÃ¨ relic itself is (head reliquary, skull reliquary, arm reliquary, hand reliquary, finger reliquary, leg reliquary, thigh reliquary, foot reliquary, rib reliquary, and so forth)" (our translation from Italian, Thesaurus del corredo ec- clesiastico di culto cattolico, http://80.205.162.234/thesaurus/ stmttura_gerarchica/index.jsp? ger=oi.oi.o6.o6.54.i8&amp;idnews =3637). "The presumed head of St. John thÃ¨ Baptist is exhibited in Rome, in thÃ¨ little church of San Silvestro in Capite that was named after it" (translated from http://it.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Lista_di_reliquie). East of thÃ¨ Adriatic Sea: "The skull of St. Blasius (San Biagio) in Dubrovnik (formerly Ragusa, in Croatia)" (ibid.). And for Sicily: "The body of St. Agatha in Catania, subdivided in sev- eral reliquaries: some organs in thÃ¨ bust with head; goldsmiths of Limoges also made thÃ¨ reli- quaries for arms and legs: one for each femur, one for each arm, one for each leg. In 1628, thÃ¨ mamillary one was made [for one breast]" (ibid.).32 Also consider: "The dish that allegedly contained thÃ¨ head of St. John thÃ¨ Bap- 28 In traditional as well as present- day Jewish communities, thÃ¨ hevra qaddisa is a pious associa- tion that organizes funerals. The reference in thÃ¨ quotation is to a synagogue in Toronto that was established by such an associa- tion; presumably, members had formed a minyan, i.e., a quorate congregation, and eventually an autonomous piace of worship was formed, whose congregants of course could also be non-mem- bers of thÃ¨ pious association of thÃ¨ undertakers. 29 Moshe Idels scholarly domain, in which he is prominenti, is thÃ¨ study of thÃ¨ history of Jewish mysticism His book on thÃ¨ Go- lem (Idei 1996) is a scholarly das- sic, essential for understanding thÃ¨ Golem myth. JO Eli Yassif is prominent in thÃ¨ study of thÃ¨ Jewish folktale from thÃ¨ viewpoint of international folklore studies (Yassif 1994). 31 Also in Molise, in Venafro, thÃ¨ head reliquary of St. Nicander (San Nicandro). It was com- missioned by Johannes de Goc- co, and made in 1340 by Barba- tus de Sulmona. A French influ- ence, through a Neapolitan con- duit, has been detected. The nat- ural-size head shows a man in his youth, and is girded by a chiselled crown. The eyes are enamelled, and converge. The base has eight enamel medals. Enamels were contextualized within a region- al artisan school of Abruzzi (and Molise), indebted to thÃ¨ models of Tuscan artisans and ones from Siena (southern Tuscany). 32 In Sicily, there are a head rel- iquary of a crowned saint, and a bust reliquary with a contain- er in thÃ¨ breast, as well as eight arm- and one leg-reliquaries, in- side a glasscase found on thÃ¨ left side in thÃ¨ terminal chapel in thÃ¨ right-side aisle of thÃ¨ Basilica of S. Maria Maggiore of fspica, in thÃ¨ province of Ragusa (according to http://www.sentieridelbarocco.it/ STORIAECULTURA/TRIGILIA/lI_2.htm) .</page><page sequence="13">GHASTLY REPRESENTATIONS IN FOLKLORE, I 145 Reliquary bust ofSt. Januarius (busto-reliquiario di San Gennaro), fromNaples. It was made during thÃ¨ Angevin period. It is dressed up during thÃ¨ procession towards thÃ¨ Basilica di Santa Chiara. This image, in thepublic domain, was taken by Julia Janfien (postedat httpillit.wikipedia. org/wiki/Immagine:St._ Januarius__-_Bust.jpg) tist (Genoa, treasury of San Lorenzo cathedral)" (ibid.). Also in Liguria, more to thÃ¨ west: "The relics of St. Lucid- us (San Lucido) in Aquarara (in thÃ¨ province of Savona). They were repeatedly stolen. At thÃ¨ long last thÃ¨ head was found by law enforcers [ei- ther thÃ¨ police, or thÃ¨ Cara- binieri] at a private home in 1999" (ibid.). Further to thÃ¨ west, stili in Liguria, in Alben- ga (in thÃ¨ province of Impe- ria), in Hall III of thÃ¨ Museo Diocesano d'Arte, some glass- cases contain silverware, along with thÃ¨ I5th-century head rel- iquaries of two saints, name- ly, "di San Calocero e di San Verano" (quoted from http:// www.diocesialbengaimperia. it/Museo/Museo_2.htm) . The following is translated from Bavoni (2002), who de- scribes exhibits at thÃ¨ Museum of Sacred Art of thÃ¨ Bishopric of Volterra in Tuscany: In thÃ¨ glasscase above, thÃ¨ Te- sta reliquiario di San Vittore (St. VÃ-ctors head reliquary), of silver, embossed, chiselled, and enam- elled. It is thÃ¨ archetype of thÃ¨ entire production of bust reli- quaries of thÃ¨ vestry of thÃ¨ ca- thedral (Sacrestia del Duomo). It was donateci, along with thÃ¨ skull of thÃ¨ Saint, by Pope Cal- ixtus II in 1120. HistorÃ-ans relate that this head, too, was taken as a booty by Ferrucci s soldiers, in 1530, and that it was ransomed with offers made by thÃ¨ people and quickly obtained and con- signed to thÃ¨ soldiers before they would destroy it. The head is represented as a face that is not characterized [i.e., not delineat- ed to match a specifÃ-c person], with almond eyes and of thÃ¨ pu- pils of blue enamel. It is remark- able how thÃ¨ wavy hair is treat- ed in great detail; thÃ¨ decorative effect is great, and one can stili see traces of thÃ¨ ancient gilding. Even though not ali critics agree about ascribing thÃ¨ manufÃ ctur- ing of this head to thÃ¨ udÃ- cen- tury, in my opinion it befits with dignity thÃ¨ output of first-rate artisanship with artistic intents, from either France or Germa- ny from that period. [...] On thÃ¨ right side, one can see St. Octa- vians reliquary bust (Busto rel- iquiario di Sant'Ottaviano), of embossed and chiselled silver, thÃ¨ bust proper being of gilded copper. The originai was com- missioned by Bishop Ugolino de* Giugni from thÃ¨ Fiorentine goldsmith Antonio del Pollaio- lo, who consigned it in 1470. This was thÃ¨ first reliquary of this typology manufÃ ctured for thÃ¨ Cathedral of Volterra. The bust, that used to contain thÃ¨ head of thÃ¨ Saint, is described as follows in thÃ¨ first inventory of thÃ¨ cathedral, perhaps from 1525: "Una testa di Sancto Ot- taviano testa et barba elargente) tutto il resto di rame dorato di- adema di rame dorato con ba- sa di legno dorata et smaltata1 ["A head of St. Octavian: head and bearci of silver, ali thÃ¨ test of gilded copper, diadem of gilded copper, thÃ¨ base being of gild- ed and enamelled wood"]. The bust escaped thÃ¨ rapacity of thÃ¨ soldiers of Federigo of Urbino during thÃ¨ looting of 1472. It didn't escape, instead, accord- ing to thÃ¨ chroniders, thÃ¨ raids of Francesco Ferrucci in 1530, and perhaps thÃ¨ silver head was melted in order to mint coins in order to pay thÃ¨ mercenaries. Four years after thÃ¨ events relat- ing to Ferrucci, in 1534, thÃ¨ Pri- ors of thÃ¨ Commune (Priori del Comune) donated to thÃ¨ Ves- try (Sacrestia), offers having en- abled this, a new bust reliquary of St. Octavian, thÃ¨ one current- ly exhibited. It may be that thÃ¨ Commune of Volterra had thÃ¨ silver head made anew, perhaps by a Fiorentine goldsmith, in or- der to insert it above thÃ¨ ancient bust of gilded copper made by Pollaiolo.
