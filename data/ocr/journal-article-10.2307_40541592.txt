<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tarasca: Ritual Monster of Spain DAVID D. GILMORE Professor of Anthropology Stony Brook University HUMAN MIND needs its monsters. Throughout history dragons, demons, ogres, and other horrible fantasies have served as metaphors for evil and fear. Awful beings are as old as the human imagination: one of the earliest images is the Paleolithic engraving "The Sorcerer," depicting a bizarre anthropomorph combining a human head and legs with animal horns and paws (Leroi-Gourhan 1982, 54). Western literature is full of fearful cryptomorphs; the cannibal fiend Grendel in Beowulf was probably the earliest example in English (War- ner 1998; Cohen 1999). 1 Today Hollywood's ghouls and extraterrestrials carry on this ancient monster genre and draw the same eager audiences. For cultural anthropologists like myself, these images command in- terest because they feature prominently in the lore of every society, past and present (Cohn 1993). As such, monsters and mythological beasts have been the focus of some scholarly attention in the past decade (An- driano 1998; Rose 2000). Typically, mythic creatures provide foils for epic culture heroes from Gilgamesh to the mythologies of modern tribes (Campbell 1968). Similarly, scary effigies, grotesque masks, and other frightful paraphernalia combining human and animal elements appear in luxuriant variety in rituals worldwide, engaging ordinary people in mock battles pitting good against evil. Across time and cultures, mon- sters, rituals, and epic struggles seem to go together. In this paper I examine a monster in a ritual context in Europe. Our example is the Tarasca: a gigantic dragon-like creature that appears in many shapes and guises throughout the Iberian peninsula, variably com- bining reptilian, mammalian, and avian morphological features, adding the customary ingredients of malice, violence, and man-eating. The par- ticular Tarasca I looked at in Spain was that of the village of Hacinas in 1 Beowulf of course has other monsters: the Sea-Hag (Grendel's mother), elves, ores, giants, and the dragon that ultimately kills the hero in an epic battle. "The Sorcerer" is the name archaeologists have given to the cave drawing in the French Pyrenees.

Related to the Pentecostal dragon and possi- bly to the Leviathan of the Bible, the Tarascas make their appearance in Iberia mainly during the feast of Corpus Christi in June, but in some remote villages like Hacinas during the February Carnival. Unleashed from their hibernation in town hall basements and ani- mated by mechanical contrivances, these Tarascas attack bystanders, frighten children, and "bite" and "eat" passersby. Along with innumer- able various proxies, myrmidons, and attendants such as demons and imps, Tarascas appear also in southern France (where they are called Tarasques after their birthplace, the Provençal town of Tarascón). Ta- rascas are also fixtures throughout Latin America, including Brazil and the islands (Dumont 1951; Foster 1960). Despite the colorful festivals and imagery involved, scholars on both sides of the Atlantic have virtually ignored the Tarasca as an object of study. Aside from Dumont's excellent but dated book on Tarascón in France and a whistle-stop tour by Foster (1960, 195) of Latin America, we have very little systematic analysis. This is perhaps most surprising when it comes to Hispanic studies, since the tradition remains most vi- brant in Spain. There has been some folklorist interest in France, but there the Tarasque ceremonies have become largely tourist attractions (Nourri 1973; Renard 1991; Gueusquin 2000). What is of particular interest in the Spanish case is the Tarasca's promiscuous blend of the- matic elements: the Tarasca combines monstrosity with cannibalism, all leavened with a dose of misogyny - a combination not often empha- sized outside of Spain and capable of providing insights about Spanish folk culture. Let me pause to consider this misogynistic element. In Spain the Corpus Christi dragons often carry a female figurine or statuette on their spines or display some other female symbol. They thereby seem to con- flate womanhood in some implicit but ambiguous way with mythical dread, aggression, and danger. Most frequent here are representations of colorful sirens or biblical femmes fatales and temptresses, i.e., sexy bad girls. In the city of Granada, for instance, perched atop the dragon stands a life-sized female model resembling a department-store manne- quin. Each year this plaster beauty sports the latest come-hither fash- ions selected by a municipal committee (fig. 1). Farther north, in To- ledo, the official Tarasca mascot is a papier-mâché dragon that carries on its back a tiny doll with long yellow hair representing the sixteenth- century English queen Anne Boleyn. The blonde doll symbolizes Henry VIII's sexual dalliance and the subsequent discarding of Catherine of Aragon (the Spanish princess the king got rid of to marry Anne), an act that ushered in the Protestant Reformation and thus represents evil in- carnate to Spanish Catholics as well as a blow to Spanish pride (López</page><page sequence="3">364 DAVID D. GILMORE Figure 1. The Granada Tarasca with female statuette. Photo courtesy Salvador Rodriguez Becerra. Gómez 1996, 4-5) (fig. 2). In other cases, such as that of Hacinas, the Tarasca does not carry a female emblem of sin, but rather attacks women and girls and eats them up. No matter what form it may take, the Ta- rasca unifies multiple notions of infamy, aggression, and illicit sexual- ity, producing a composite metaphor that combines human and animal with fantastic components. A Synoptic Approach: Four Theorists My approach will lean on work by four anthropologists who have stud- ied "the Monstrous" in culture and rite, starting with familiar and clas- sic studies by Mary Douglas and Victor Turner. More recently Timothy Mitchell (1988, 1990) and Maurice Bloch (1992) have enlivened the discussion. Douglas (1966) provides insights into the relevance of de-</page><page sequence="4">TARASCA: RITUAL MONSTER OF SPAIN 365 Figure 2. The Toledo Tarasca led through the streets monic imagery to belief and public ceremony. Working with concepts of pollution and "un-naturalness," she correlates notions of terror with the transgression of established cultural categories. In her terminology, monsters and other awesome grotesqueries are "interstitial" because they cross the ontological and moral boundaries recognized by the cul- ture. Such deviations are frightening or shocking to people because they fail to follow known rules and limitations, because they threaten the cosmological order, and because they are taboo - invested with magical destructive powers. Further insights come from Turner's work on African rituals (1968, 1977). He helps us further understand how ritual works to contain the fears embodied in monsters. He argues that all societies have pressure points or "nodes of affliction" (1968), where internal contradictions and conflicts abound, creating affective ambivalence that must be de- fused by the body politic. For Turner, rituals and ceremonies perform the function of relieving these tensions in society and in individuals. Ritual presents a liminal time when people can reconcile ambivalent</page><page sequence="5">366 DAVID D. GILMORE or contradictory tendencies in the culture. The essence of liminality is found in its release from normal constraints. Hence the "meaningful- ness of ordinary life" may then be reconstructed in novel ways, "some of them bizarre to the point of monstrosity" (1977, 68). These useful observations have been expanded recently by Timothy Mitchell and Maurice Bloch in ways that are especially relevant to the Spanish case. Working with folklore narratives, Hispanicist Timothy Mitchell (1988, 1990) has proposed a similar interpretation for Spanish community rituals like Carnival that channel aggressions into "mytho- poetic" expressions such as demons, ghouls, and dragons. In a similar vein and in a more general sense, Maurice Bloch (1992) has proposed a universal theory of religious ritual involving the idea of "rebounding violence," a concept derived from earlier work by Girard (1972) and others on the role of aggression in worship. Bloch's ideas seem espe- cially relevant in the case of Tarasca. Like Mitchell, Bloch argues that in order for societies to regenerate themselves over time, they must have rituals in which people are at- tacked by an external force representing evil, usually embodied in the form of a menacing animal or a monster. The people then defeat the monster through common action, killing the beast and returning to normalcy, not in the same form as before, but with a renewed "vitality" that they derive from appropriating and "consuming" the power of the thing they have killed. Through this "rebounding violence" the commu- nity "consumes the vitality of the external reality" and absorbs the power of the "sacrificial object" (hence the common "eating" imagery in religious ritual). The rites turn the tables on the alien aggressor, trans- forming the people from prey into hunter and enacting "societal regen- eration" (Bloch 1992, 46). Citing far-flung evidence, Bloch concludes that all societies must create such rituals to survive: "To end here is per- haps to suggest that, given the raw materials of our shared perceptions of the processes of life and with the limited goods of ritualisation and metaphor at our disposal, the constructions of rebounding violence, in their many structural forms and contents, are the only way in which the necessary image of society as a transcendental and legitimate order can be constructed" (ibid., 105). The Spanish case serves as corroboration of this theory. In what follows I will try to build upon the work of Bloch and the others cited above to show how the Tarasca ceremony supports a model of reli- gious ritual as a dialectic of "moral regeneration" in Bloch's terms. But there is one further element that requires separate treatment: this is the specifically erotic and misogynist rendering of the Tarasca tradition in Spain. Here I must rely on some psychoanalytic concepts for fuller understanding.</page><page sequence="6">tarasca: ritual monster of spain 367 Origins: the Tarasque As Roman Catholic and Latin countries, France and Spain naturally share many ceremonial traits (Noyes 2003). One of these is the Ta- rasque, the dragon-serpent originally associated with Pentecost and Cor- pus Christi (literally the Body of Christ). According to French scholars, the Tarasque monster is probably of Celtic origin, historically repre- sented in statuary and pictorial art as a sea serpent or dragon complete with fire-breathing snout and studded tail. It may have originated in the Middle Ages in the town of Tarascón, from which it takes its name. What is known, however, is that the contextual legend of St. Martha the dragon-slayer arose in the early twelfth century in southern France and quickly spread over the Pyrenees to Catalonia and then to the rest of Iberia. In this legend, the awful Tarasque appears as a huge amphibious beast with an equine shape but with a lion's head and toothy mouth, six bear's paws, a carapace studded with fearsome spikes, and a viper's tail. One local historian describes it as resembling "a giant armadillo" (Nourri 1973, 44). It supposedly originated in Asia Minor but migrated to the Rhone River in southern France, where it holed up, preying upon local people and eating virgins, as is customary for monsters. Celebrat- ing the beast's man-eating proclivities, the town crest of Tarascón shows a dragon with a wide-open mouth from which protrude the legs of a half-eaten human victim. Naturally, the beleaguered tarasconnais sought celestial assistance to rid themselves of this pest. Luckily for them, the holy woman St. Martha happened to be wandering around the area after a shipwreck. Alerted to the danger, she immediately stopped the monster in its tracks by drenching it with holy water. Afterward, the Tarasque supposedly became tame, but was nevertheless put to death by the people, who could no longer stand having such a horrible monster in their midst (Barber and Riches 1971, 434). Although the first written mentions of the Tarasque date from the mid-fourteenth century, one text dated 1497 cites a holy monk named Raban Maur (ca. 776-856 AD), who wrote that, between Aries and Avignon near the banks of the Rhone, there flourished a dragon "unbelievably long and huge; its breath is pestilen- tial smoke, its eyes glare sulfurously, and its snout is lined with horrible sharp teeth" (cited in Nourri 1973, 52-53). In time the monster cult became an integral part of Provençal tradi- tions, with its death at the hands of the folk of Tarascón commemorated annually on Corpus Christi or Pentecost, but latterly in some villages during Mardi Gras, or at Carnival time (Renard 1991, 5). In Tarascón proper, the observation today reaches its apogee under the auspices of</page><page sequence="7">368 DAVID D. GILMORE the Ordre des Chevaliers de la Tarasque, founded in 1474, an official Tarasque "knighthood." Using ancient prototypes, townspeople in Tar- ascón constructed a huge mechanical effigy of the beast, which they oc- casionally take out and parade during St. Martha's Day. Constructed piecemeal, the present French statue was built at various times between 1840 and 1943, according to Dumont (1951, 49-50). Supported by the efforts of sixteen members of the order inside the hollow body (repre- senting swallowed victims) and guided along city streets by another eight (symbolizing the city fathers), the French model is twenty feet long and constructed of wood and metal. It has numerous moving parts, es- pecially snapping jaws and a large spiked tail that swivels like a boom to menace bystanders. Louis Dumont tells us in his book that major processions took place in the years 1846, 1861, 1891, and right after World War II in 1946, as a thanksgiving. However, since 1946, the rit- ual continues to occur on an annual basis largely for tourists and, hav- ing lost any religious connection, has been renamed "The Feast of the Tarasque" (Gueusquin 2002, 103). From Dumont's detailed description, we learn that the effect of the effigy on celebrants was to convey the awesome power of evil and the redemptive counterforce of human bravery. As manipulated by its car- riers, the Tarasque shows animal ferocity toward onlookers as the great statue makes feints and lurches, its huge mouth yawning, its lethal tail flailing. The inevitable anthropophagie theme is also played up in the procession, as the huge beast makes as if to snatch up children in its me- chanical jaws. However, despite all this pretend violence, both Dumont and other observers have noted the keenly ambivalent attitude of the people of Tarascón toward their namesake monster. Deriving from the myth of St. Martha, the beast, as a ruthless monster from Hell, of course represents infernal forces opposed to God, but because of the associa- tion with the saint, it also symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. The Spanish Tarasca The myth made its way down to the Iberian peninsula by the thirteenth century, the first recorded mention in Seville dating from 1282, shortly after the Christian reconquest of that city (Cuesta García 2002, 183). From there it diffused rapidly to the rest of Andalusia, where, as an added fillip in some localities, the effigy would be mounted by a choir- boy called a tarasquillo (little Tarasca), whose job it was to yelp, cavort, and snatch off the hats of bystanders (Rodríguez Becerra 2000, 158). In some cities such as Madrid and Granada (Molina Blázquez 2000) the tradition in the early modern period ripened into elaborate proces- sions in which the papier-mâché effigy invoked the Dragon of Revela-</page><page sequence="8">TARASCA: RITUAL MONSTER OF SPAIN 369 tions and carried on its spine a woman playing the role of the Whore of Babylon or some other biblical temptress. Attracting much popular interest, the dragon and its good-vs.-evil rituals had become the focus of Corpus Christi all over Spain by the eighteenth century. By that time it had become such an entrenched fig- ure among the rabble that clerical and civil authorities felt it had gotten out of hand. To stem the growing licentiousness, Charles III issued a royal pragmatic, dated 21 June 1780, prohibiting further use of Taras- cas in the Corpus or Pentecost celebrations and declaring them a pagan and frivolous entertainment that imparted too much "irreverent atmo- sphere" to what should be solemn events (Sánchez Herrero 1999, 49). As in other cases of the legal interdiction of vulgar celebrations, this edict was more honored in the breach than in the observation (see Juárez and Martinez 2002). Still, the temporal switch of the parade to Carnival that occurred in Hacinas (as in other small, remote villages) at this time may have been in response to such official opprobrium, because Carnival has always been unsupervised by the Church and thus immune to official injunc- tions. The first recorded notice of the Tarasca in the Hacinas municipal records dates from 1890, at which time certain rules were promulgated governing its route during the three days of Carnival. For example, the effigy was prohibited from entering the church portico and from cross- ing the path of any cleric or entering any bakery or going to the mu- nicipal cemetery, but given free rein to roam through any street wide enough to accommodate its imposing bulk. The Village of Hacinas Situated in the Province of Burgos (Old Castile), Hacinas is a farming pueblo of about 2,000 people, but shows a pulsating population pattern because many natives live nearby and return on weekends and for holi- days, especially for February Carnival.2 The population may therefore 2 The research upon which this paper is based was supported by awards from the National Science Foundation, the Program for Cultural Cooperation between Spain's Ministry of Cul- ture and United States Universities, the John S.

Economic activities consist mainly of commercial cereal farming, with some residual cattle herding and some sheep and goats. In addition, because of the supposedly salu- brious air and cool summer nights, numerous urbanités from nearby cities and even as far away as Madrid - two hundred miles to the south - have constructed modest cottages in the hills north of the village. Consequently, construction work has provided many jobs for Hacinas natives: it is a prosperous community. Like many Spaniards, the inhabitants of Hacinas are fond of pa- rades and celebrations, both liturgical and secular, and zealously main- tain a rich ritual cycle that attracts many visitors. Standout festivals are those of the three-day pilgrimage of Santa Lucia beginning on 21 Sep- tember, in which the entire population accompanies a float carrying the female saint, whose image is located in a shrine some three miles dis- tant. Villagers bring votive offerings such as ceramic pots filled with food and bottles of alcoholic drinks (later shared by everyone), and no one may return to the village without first touching the hem of the saint's embroidered gown. As is common in the region, the winter pig slaughter has its own festival, called the remojón, (from remojar: to cel- ebrate with toasts and drinking), in which families compete in a kind of sausage-making contest and then exchange samples of their products along with other specialties, wine, and food. Despite its small size, Hacinas boasts six fully-attended clubs or civic associations: the Santa Lucia Dance Troupe (active during the Romería), the Flageolet-Players' Orchestra (a troupe of musicians ac- tive during Carnival), the Association of Home Owners (essentially a housewives' club given over to both gossip and boosterism), the Friends of Hacinas Organization (an eleemosynary association), the Hunt Club (men only), and the Club de Fútbol (men and boys only in the past, but today open also to girls and women). Obviously, civic spirit runs high in this tiny town. Although Hacinas is well known for its clubs and foods, it is best known in Spain for its Carnival, which is well attended by tourists from other parts of the country. What makes its Carnival special is its huge Tarasca effigy, which has garnered fame throughout the region for its pranks and mischief. In Hacinas people say that Carnival is the Tarasca and the Tarasca is Carnival, and many outsiders agree. As it does every- where in Spain, the Carnival in Hacinas takes place prior to Lent, usu- ally in mid-February. An entirely secular event, Carnival takes place on three days, beginning on the Sunday before Lent and ending on the following Tuesday (Shrove Tuesday), that is, the day preceding Ash Wednesday, officially the first day of Lent and the start of forty days of fasting. The French term Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, commemorates</page><page sequence="10">TARASCA: RITUAL MONSTER OF SPAIN 371 this chronology, Shrove Tuesday being the last day when people are al- lowed the pleasures of the flesh - gustatory or erotic. The Hacinas par- ish hierarchy does not, of course, participate in the celebration, which the Spanish Catholic Church has condemned as blasphemous, espe- cially since Carnival in many areas maintains anticlerical themes (Caro Baroja 1965, 28-29). In Hacinas, politics and ideology are negligible, and what matters is the march of the terrible Tarasca and its malevo- lent minions. The Hacinas Tarasca Although, as we have noted, Tarascas are common in Spain, the Haci- nas example is one of a kind. Constructed in a half-cylinder shape on a rectangular base, it is made of five or six flexible arcs of wood bent over in a semicircle, over which numerous canvas tarpaulins or other varie- gated cloths are tossed and fastened with dense stitching. Traditionally, the color of the sheets constituting the Tarasca's carapace varies each year: one year it may be monochrome and the next all the colors of the rainbow, depending upon whim. This great polyglot shell forms a kind of enclosed arch that provides ample space for the five young men who carry and operate the mechanical dragon from within. The supporting ribs are traditionally fashioned from elm or oak branches collected in the surrounding woods. However, today, both wood and metal ribbing or plastic tubing, or a combination may be used depending on avail- ability. Hacinas purists of course bemoan the use of artificial products, but as in so many other things, convenience has won out over conven- tion. Much else, however, remains as in decades past (fig. 3). The body of this great contrivance measures more than seven feet in length and about five feet in width, large enough to accommodate five men. A youth stands at each corner and acts as a pedestal, so that each of the beast's "legs" is a pair of human limbs. Although this looks somewhat bizarre (people call their Tarasca an eight-legged beastie), it provides the statue with the agility and stability by which it performs startling leaps and bounds, the acrobatism of which is considered more important than any banal morphological naturalism. The interior of the effigy is divided into three sections by the hanging folds of the can- vas tarps. Four slits in these sheets permit each corner "legman" to peer outside and also allow those outside to see the leering faces of those within. The third anterior section of the Tarasca model is occupied by the "neck-and-head man" (cuellero). His job is to manipulate the neck, head, and jaws of the mechanical beast (fig. 4). The effigy is built so that there protrudes a long flexible neck and head from the body, rather in the manner of a monstrous turtle. The</page><page sequence="11">372 DAVID D. GILMORE Figure 3. The Hacinas Tarasca in silhouette retractable neck is formed from a series of dovetailed wooden pulleys covered in cloth or canvas, which at its fullest extension can reach over a meter in length. These gimcrack devices have been salvaged from old agricultural machinery and preserved in the town hall from year to year. To the end of this "neck" the youths have affixed the ugly little head, which is made of a wooden plank affixed to the jawbone of a donkey, a mule, or occasionally a horse - whichever equine happens to be available in a given year (the jawbone of a recently deceased mare was used in 2002). The headman manipulates the pulleys from within, moving the neck laterally like a boom, whipping the head from side to side and backward and forward and, using additional strings and wires, "snapping" the jaws open and closed like a carnivore. To the wooden upper jaws have been attached "teeth," usually made of nails or other pointed objects painted white. The final product closely resembles the mulassa figures found in Corpus Christi festivals throughout Catalonia in northeast Spain: something morphologically between a dragon, a weird mule, and an immense tortoise (see Noyes 2003). Some of the Catalonian mulassas have fireworks or roman candles affixed to their mouths and so are made to be fire-breathing (Armengou i Feliu 1994) (fig. 5). In Hacinas, there are no such pyrotechnics; the head simply moves on its boom to snap at passersby and, more important, to cap- ture young women by its magical touch.</page><page sequence="12">TARASCA: RITUAL MONSTER OF SPAIN 373 Figure 4. The Hacinas Tarasca, showing legs of tarasquillos The townspeople elect five young men, chosen at random every year, to the positions of Tarasca carriers (called tarasquillos). The youths so honored must by unwritten agreement be legal residents of the village, having been born within its confines; they must be willing to accept the role of tarasquillo with enthusiasm, must be in good physical condi- tion, and must be in the twenty-year-old consort or quinta (previously when Spain had a universal draft, this was the quinta of conscription for all able-bodied males). Every year, two weeks before Carnival, the five honorées meet and go off together on an expedition to neighboring villages and farmsteads to find or dig up an appropriate jawbone from an equine skeleton. This is the disagreeable part for the tarasquillos. The men complain vociferously of the distastefulness of this task, which, unless someone has preserved and cleaned a jawbone for them, may in- volve excavating dead farm animals, disarticulating skeletons, putting up with the awesome stench, gaining the requisite permission from often disputatious farmers and landowners, and so on. Nevertheless, all the youths of Hacinas consider it a privilege and an honor to carry on the tradition. In 2002, after a long, fruitless search for the preferred don- key's jawbone, the five boys finally came up with a horse's mandible, teeth intact, which they found in a garbage dump. The head of the Ta- rasca is, and is supposed to be, smelly, ugly, and loathsome. Traditionally, after finding a suitable skull, the elected five, along with their compeers and friends, would assemble for their own preliminary</page><page sequence="13">374 DAVID D. GILMORE Figure 5. The fire-breathing Guita of Berga, a town in Catalonia. Photo courtesy Manuel Escobet/Foto Luigi, Berga. rites in the forests surrounding Hacinas. Starting after Christmas, they would locate secluded spots where they gathered the (often purloined) materials for making the Tarasca effigy: wood or metal jibs, canvas strips or discarded sheets, needles and thread, pulleys, ropes, and so on. Treated as hallowed ground, these secret forest places were called tena- das (deriving from a word meaning cattle shed). These Tarasca caches were imbued with an aura of mystery and reverence, which was, how- ever, mingled with much merrymaking on the part of the tarasquillos. On the days before Carnival the men would meet in the tenadas to cook late-night meals, to build bonfires, and finally to construct the Tarasca structure in its entirely and carry it into the town to begin their depre- dations on the first day of Carnival. After the 1980s, these customs</page><page sequence="14">TARASCA: RITUAL MONSTER OF SPAIN 375 Figure 6. The Hacinas curra led through the streets lightened up a bit: in 2002, for example, the tarasquillos met openly on weekends in the village rather than hiding in the forest, and stored the Tarasca materials in their own homes rather than sequestering them in the tenadas. Like many Tarascas in Spain, the Hacinas monster boasts a color- ful retinue of smaller creatures. Accompanying the Tarasca through the streets are many attendant mythical figures. The most important of these is the "curra," also known as the "vaca romera" (a colloquialism that may be rendered as magical cow). The curra is a hollow statuette made of wood and resembling a bovine, pegged out with colored pin- ions, banners, streamers, and other fanciful ribbons (fig. 6). It sports long and pointy horns, but these are not used aggressively. Holding it up are three boys who carry the figure aloft and dance merrily through- out town, not attacking or molesting people but demanding gifts and money, combining ludic and aggressive elements typical of Spanish Car- nivals (Gilmore 1987, 1998). Running and jumping through town, the curra recites the following nonsense ditty: Un huevito para La gallinita pinta, Gallo gallina Para la tia Martina, Gallina gallo Para el tio Nazario Give us a little egg A present for the little hen, Rooster, hen Give a gift for Aunt Martina, Rooster, hen Something for Uncle Nazario</page><page sequence="15">376 DAVID D. GILMORE The magical cow follows the Tarasca rather like an assistant, and when the big monster effigy disappears at the end of the festival, the little one disappears as well. Following closely in the path of the curra and the Tarasca are smaller figures called curritas (little demons), played by children in the guise of devils, diabolical clowns, little monsters, ghouls, and pitchfork-wielding imps, rather like American Halloween masquer- aders. These figures disport and gyrate, emitting high-pitched wails. One of their objectives is to generally "annoy" (molestar) bystanders by throwing things at them. Although the curra 's attacks are solely ver- bal, the little curritas, who can become overexcited, sometimes engage in physical abuse, striking out, hurling water from concealed bottles at bystanders, tossing rags, rubbish, and ashes at anyone crossing their path. Some of their costumes are store-bought, some handmade. As one may see, children play a major role in Hacinas Carnival, both as participants and spectators, frightening and being frightened. Virtually every child is in the streets as an observer if not in costume, smaller ones supervised by parents, those old enough to walk left pretty much to their own devices. Thus unleashed, the urchins run in packs, shrieking and crying with mixed emotions, half terrified and half intox- icated with their unsupervised freedom. Some of the bolder ones may ap- proach and pummel the effigies, slapping and shouting, and are in turn attacked by the cavorting demons scampering alongside the Tarasca's jaws. Most of the kids, however, content themselves with pelting the monster with candy from a distance, throwing wads of paper and plas- tic objects, and generally running wild. Hysterical children form a kind of kaleidoscopic, endlessly flowing backdrop to the entire festival. While all this mayhem is going on, the Tarasca rushes about through the town, attacking nubile girls and women, stomping, leaping, and gy- rating. If the beast's ugly, malodorous head touches a girl, she is sup- posed to be magically "swallowed" and must enter the capacious body of the effigy until "ransomed" by her husband, boyfriend, or a male kins- man. To rescue their maidens the boys are supposed to offer bottles of wine, usually cheap local champagne (cava), small amounts of money, or other portable valuables. Sometimes, depending on whim, the Tarasca will accept as ransom sexual jokes or witty repartee from the gallant man standing outside the beast's belly, but in all cases such verbal offer- ings must have some crude double entendre to secure the girl's release. Although victims are almost all female, the ravenous Tarasca will oc- casionally swallow a young man. When this happens, the tradition is for the tarasquillos to pull off their victim's pants and to sprinkle salt and vinegar on his genitals as a warning to keep away from the local girls, who belong to the Tarasca. However, from what I could gather, this pain- ful punishment has not been inflicted since the early 1990s. Instead, the</page><page sequence="16">TARASCA: RITUAL MONSTER OF SPAIN 377 tarasquillos throw water on the male captive's crotch to mark the victim as "unmanned." The Tarasca has sexual monopoly during Carnival. The mechanical beast treats its female victims worse than the occa- sional boys it ingests. Having engulfed a young woman, the Tarasca proceeds to "undress" and symbolically violate her, as denoted by much jumping, shaking, and shouting. To add verisimilitude, the tarasquillos carry articles of female clothing - shoes, socks, and sweaters, et cetera - which they toss out of the monster's belly to demonstrate how the beast is having its way with its victim. As soon as the ransom is paid off, the girls emerge and flee to the safety of their homes. All of this is of course done in fun, but some of the girls complain rather glumly about ill treatment and the roughness of the sexual horseplay, which they find offensive. My female Spanish research associate was volun- tarily caught by the Tarasca in the 2002 festival and eaten up, and al- though she reported no physical abuse, she did experience some very rough sexual horseplay and threats before being released. Her chival- rous husband achieved her freedom by reciting some dirty jokes memo- rized for this purpose. Perhaps the most striking element of the Tarasca is its ability to dance, prance, and pirouette while chasing its prey. Inspired by past performances, the tarasquillos practice their capers beforehand and ex- ecute them with an amazing agility. The huge ungainly beast scampers over obstacles effortlessly, leaps up and down steps, kicks up its four hind "legs" like a perverse mule, and has been known to jump two feet into the air, all the while tracking down and cornering its victims. Each year the monster's athletic performance is subjected to heated debate and evaluation. Finally, of course, the Tarasca must be sacrificed so that good con- quers evil according to custom. After the three days of choreographed mayhem and cannibalistic depredations, the Tarasca admits defeat, wilts, and withdraws meekly to the outskirts of town, where it is sym- bolically "killed" by the mayor wielding a wand. Free from their servi- tude, the tarasquillos emerge into the air to celebrate the death of the monster with a final meal together. With this last repast the festival is done. The monster of course waits in suspended animation for Carni- val the following year. Summary and Conclusions Let us now revisit our original assumptions. First, we note that for the participants in Hacinas Carnival the Tarasca is a figure of fun and joy, but it also exudes a strain of aggressive misogyny that many female res- idents, not to mention tourists, find somewhat unsettling. In the spirit</page><page sequence="17">378 DAVID D. GILMORE of feminist currents in Spain, a group of young women protested in 1992 to town officials and, when rebuffed, sought to build their own female monster, which they intended to use to attack boys and men. While their plan was never carried out, and indeed met with stiff oppo- sition from officialdom and, especially, from older women, some of the younger, more modern girls find the Tarasca appalling, and they told me so without compunction. Accordingly, today the festival tends to polarize the sexes as well as the generations. Also, many children are frightened by the gigantic mock- up with its snapping teeth and foul breath, and many of them burst into tears at the roaring of the demons. But despite these negatives - or perhaps because of them - the Tarasca breaks down boundaries be- tween things normally kept separate in the mind: humor and terror, man and beast, order and disorder, old and young, life and death, and so on. In so collapsing opposites, the Tarasca causes people to pause and to think about and question everyday reality in the non-Carnival uni- verse. All these observations of course support the structural arguments of our four theorists above and in particular seem to corroborate Bloch's concept (1992) of the regenerative power of "rebounding vio- lence." However, there are three specific features here that need psycho- logical amplification beyond simply confirming the work of previous theorists. We must first note that like most grotesque fantasies, the Hacinas monster combines disparate organic "realities" into a bizarre and mon- strous image that by its very oddness and the resulting "cognitive mis- match" captures people's attention and sparks the imagination, especially that of children (Konner 2002, 222). The Pentecostal beastie combines equine, reptilian, and bird-like features with a giraffe's neck, an ele- phant's bulk, an impossible number of legs, the usual human malevo- lence, and the satyr's insatiable lust. The monster also combines cognitive antitheses in a way that re- inforces cultural biases while at the same time undermining them - a typical paradox of the Monstrous in ritual and art (Andriano 1999). In the Hacinas festival the integrated themes are those of bodily mutila- tion, sexual abuse, cannibalism, death, and decay. All these themes come together in certain compelling Iberian traditions: misogyny, costumed parading, religious revitalization, ritual displacement of aggression onto external objects, spontaneous street theatre. All forms of aggression are visually embodied in the image of the mystic beast, as happens every day in the classic Spanish bullfight pitting man against raw nature (Mitchell 1991). Peremptory male sexuality both parodied and glorified, women both raped and rescued, children both terrified and liberated. As Bloch has argued in the aptly titled Prey into Hunter (1992), the narrative of</page><page sequence="18">TARASCA: RITUAL MONSTER OF SPAIN 379 the Tarasca rite, turning victim into victimize^ enables the community to "absorb the vitality" of the external threat and thereby to regenerate itself and to transcend everyday reality. We may make a third, psychoanalytic, observation. As with all such fabulous and scary images, the Tarasca provokes regressive responses that probably go back to the primary organization of the mind before the advent of speech. In this childhood environment, sensations are limited to visions and primary emotions, and the world is experienced largely through the eyes and mouth. Psychoanalysts of childhood have called this the phase of oral/visual primacy. It may explain the locus of aggression in typical monster imagery: the rending teeth, the gnashing jaws, the cavernous belly. It would also help us understand the terror at being devoured by a giant predator during the ritual or, as Bloch puts it (1992, 101), "the horrifying possibility of being consumed" as an es- sential aspect of ritual process. The snapping mouth as well as other in- corporative morphological features of the Hacinas monster, for exam- ple, the bulging belly, give an animated shape to primordial fear, with its dynamic mixture of oral, erotic, and self-identity themes. This is exactly what Bloch refers to as the "consuming" threat, the evil that "bites" and "eats" before succumbing to the power of the good. The Tarasca exemplifies both childhood anxieties and the resid- ual fears of adults; and so the festival evokes passionate intensity in all age groups. As Turner might have put it, the "pressure points" that find expression in Hacinas are those between sexual desire and guilt, terror and curiosity, good and evil, purity and corruption; the tensions are those between old and young, death and re-birth (emerging anew from the Tarasca's belly). All of these themes are probably universally en- countered and thus constitute the "core" of rituals everywhere by "re- enacting the creation of moral life" (Bloch 1992, 47). Although the Tarasca frightens children and makes them bawl and run away, it also stimulates their cognitive growth and offers ultimately a sense of safety provided by a united and victorious community. Some child psychologists such as Denyse Beaudet (1990) and Jean Piaget (1962, 229) have surmised as much. Piaget says that unconstrained mental op- erations caused by shock or disorientation provide Spielraum: an imag- inary playground where youngsters experiment with ideas. Bruno Bettel- heim says that such creativity permits children to give anxieties tangible form: these can then be distanced and defeated (1976, 120). This pro- jective process, beginning in infancy, of course continues in adulthood, not only in dreams and fantasy but in community rituals, where it reaches apotheosis as Bloch has so persuasively argued. Finally, we must address the misogynist theme that is so marked in the Spanish festival. Many anthropologists have noted the theme of the</page><page sequence="19">380 DAVID D. GILMORE treacherous siren in Spanish folklore, a theme that corresponds to the female models carried aloft on the Tarasca's spine in Granada, Toledo, and other places. One observer, Stanley Brandes, was impressed with the pervasiveness of this specific male anxiety in the Andalusian town of Monteros. In his book on male folklore, Metaphors of Masculinity (1980), Brandes records a number of popular aphorisms that warn men to protect their fragile manhood from duplicitous females or suffer emas- culation (one urges men literally to keep their penises in their pants or be castrated). In my own fieldwork in Seville Province, I found the eating/castration theme paramount in male folklore and I have recorded numerous Carni- val ditties warning men and boys against the vagina dentata and other forms of female sexual aggression (Gilmore 1987; 1998). Literary scholar Louise Vasvari (1991, 3) refers to the "gastro-genital equivalence" sym- bolism of Spanish versification, which she identifies in writings dating back to the Middle Ages. Given all this evidence, we may conclude that with its defining misogynist theme and its female/monster imagery, the Spanish Tarasca embodies a dread of feminine sexuality that colors the Spanish male subculture. In particular, in the Hacinas case, the misogy- nist element combines a devouring theme along with the castration threat in the attack on the boys' genitals and in the liquid thrown onto the crotch, symbolizing, one may conjecture, semen and blood. While these themes are probably universal, their annual apotheosis in visual tropes, public rites, monster effigies, and masques may be specific to Spain. Both appalling in its ferocity and ennobling in its ultimate function as sacrificial object, the Tarasca is one of countless projections of uni- versal human mental shadows as an embodiment, a visual metaphor, as James Fernandez has shown in his classic paper on the role of tropes in culture (1986). Like the other monsters of the world, the Tarascas of Spain are man-eaters and rapists, both lascivious females and priapic males; their toothy (and in Hacinas smelly) oral symbolism is at the same time lurid and hypnotic to the crowds that fight them. As an as- pect of local pride, the beast calls forth reverence as well as repugnance. Frightening and also endearing, the Tarasca embodies the human imag- ination in all its whimsy, grotesqueness, and terror. References Andriano, Joseph. 1999.
