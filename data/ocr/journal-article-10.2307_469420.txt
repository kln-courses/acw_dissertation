<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetry as Invocation Thomas M. Greene I RANOISE GILOT'S memoir of her years with Picasso includes an anecdote in which the painter relates his first visit as a young man to the Musee de l'Homme, the ethnographic mu- seum in Paris. Friends had encouraged him to go, but the mildewed atmosphere of the place almost drove him away before he saw anything. However, he told Gilot, "I forced myself to stay, to scrutinize those masques, all those objects which men had fashioned with a sacred, magical intent, as intermediaries between them and the unknown hostile forces which surrounded them, thus attempting to overcome their terror in giving the forces color and form." Then, continues Picasso, making a remarkable leap from the ethnographic collection to the universal realm of art, "then I understood that this was the true meaning of painting. Painting is not an aesthetic process; it's a form of magic which is interposed between the hostile universe and ourselves, a means of seizing power, of imposing form on our fears as on our desires. The day I understood that, I knew that I had found my way."' Picasso's links between form and control, form and power, potentially transcend the visual arts. In the pages that follow I want to consider to what degree his "magical" theory of art might be reformulated to apply to lyric poetry. The consideration of that question will be focused on a scheme which was once a subgenre of poetry and later became both a topos and a structural element-namely, the invocation. At least three influential critics of the last fifteen years have suggested that the trope of apostrophe is central to the poetic text.2 The argument here will be that apostrophe constitutes half of the dual act of invoking, which act can be read as an epitome, in some respects an allegory, of the activity attributable to poetry. An invocation typically contains both an apostrophe, an address to an absent or inanimate being, and a summons to appear or to make its influence felt in the invoker's experience. Ostensibly, apostrophes are more common than invocations. But the rarer speech-act, combining spe- cific verbal form with assumed power, may be the more rewarding key to the force of poetry.3 New Literary History, 1993, 24: 495-517</page><page sequence="2">496 NEW LITERARY HISTORY We can begin with one of the briefest of the Homeric hymns, "To Hestia," a text from archaic Greece which was doubtless used for purposes of religious cult: "Hestia, you who tend the holy house of the lord Apollo, the Far-shooter at goodly Pytho, with soft oil dripping ever from your locks, come now into this house, come, having one mind with Zeus the all-wise-draw near, and withal bestow grace upon my song."4 This text is typical of the collecti6n in which it appears, as it is of Greek religious practice generally, in following the name of the divinity addressed with her "attributes," conventional characteristics or associations or specifying accoutre- ments. Listing the attributes (here the dwelling-place, the associations with Apollo and Zeus, the oiled hair) was apparently a form of paying honor which also increased the substance, the specificity, the density and power of the god. Structurally, the attributes fill out the name of the figure apostrophized; they are properly considered part of the name, and they are frequently filled out with periphrastic alternatives for it. Thus this little hymn exemplifies the basic dual structure of the invocation: first, the (extended) name called upon in the vocative and, second, the summons to "draw near" as a physical presence and as a source of benevolent favor. In Greek cult, hymns of this kind were not expected to be binding; that is, they were not conceived to coerce the divinity addressed to perform the requested action, but they were conceived, as are most prayers anywhere, to place pressure upon him or her to comply. In this respect the invocation as prayer lies in a middle position between magical rites, which were regarded as coercive, and poetic invocations, which are not expected to produce the literal results they request. Despite this difference, the texts employed with magical expectations are relevant to the study of poetry. Poetic invocations pretend to behave as though the speaker had magical power, and there exists strong evidence that the verbal techniques we associate with versification did not in fact first enter human culture to gratify aesthetic pleasure but rather to make something happen (or to prevent its happening).5 Part of the evidence is etymological; in a large number of languages, the usage of a word such as carmen to mean "charm" appears to have preceded its usage as "poem." (The English and romance languages, being derived, exhibit both usages simultaneously, but the connections are easily traceable: compare "chant" and "enchantment" in English.) Even if there were no diachronic priority, the impulse to use words and signs teleologically is culturally primordial. When the struggle for subsistence has few tools, men and women have recourse to what they possess insofar as they are acculturated at all-their symbols. The persistence of</page><page sequence="3">POETRY AS INVOCATION 497 magic, the nostalgia for magic, the dangerous returns of suppressed magic, betray what looks like a perennial human need for signs endowed with potency in themselves. These are not the formulas, catalogued by Austin, empowered by the designated authorities in conventional speech-acts; these are signs which carry their energy within them, although in some cases the energy can only be tapped by specifically gifted individuals. In the verbal gestures of poetry which has detached itself from its putative origins, we can discern the vestigial gestures of the shaman, as Picasso discerned analogous gestures in painting. Ut pictura poesis. The vestigial continuity does not mean of course that poetry is merely withered magic, but it might suggest that we continue to be afflicted by the sensation of lack that confronted our earliest ancestors. We wrap the shawl of the imagination tightly round us, wrote Stevens, "since we are poor."' We have no strictly magical texts extant from archaic Greece, but we have them in abundance from other times and places, and in these the dual invocational structure is common. I select examples from three disparate societies. The first is an Egyptian love spell from the twentieth dynasty, several centuries earlier than the "Hymn to Hestia": Hail to thee, Of Re-Harakhte, Father of the Gods! Hail to you, O ye seven Hathors Who are adorned with strings of red thread! Hail to you, ye Gods, lords of heaven and earth! Come [make] so-and-so born of so-and-so come after me.7 Any male speaker could use this spell apparently to acquire the favors of any desired female, filling in the blanks in the fifth line. (But other love spells existed in Egypt and elsewhere for females, as the more sophisticated texts of Theocritus's second idyll and Virgil's eighth eclogue remind us. Magic appears not to be gender specific.) The full Egyptian text only varies from the basic two-part structure by adding a threat at the end to ensure the expected compliance. The awesome power of the name as a repository of power is explicit in an invocation of Saint Patrick from eighth-century Ireland: We invoke holy Patrick, Ireland's chief apostle. Glorious is his wondrous name, a flame that baptized heathen; He warred against hard-hearted wizards. He thrust down the proud with the help of our Lord of fair heaven. He purified Ireland's meadow-lands, a mighty birth.</page><page sequence="4">498 NEW LITERARY HISTORY We pray to Patrick chief apostle; his judgment hath delivered us in Doom from the malevolence of dark devils. God be with us, together with the prayer of Patrick, chief apostle.8 Although the speakers employ the verb "pray" to describe their communal action, they are in fact using the name of Patrick as a talisman to ensure divine support, and the text has rightly been regarded as an example of Christian magic. Here the attributes are actions performed by the saint according to legend, including the apotropaic struggle against (evil) wizards. My last example calls upon an object, rather than a divine or legendary personage, as a repository of power. This Middle English spell, to be spoken by one departing on a journey, is taken from the anthology Secular [sic] Lyrics of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, where it is entitled "A Charm by the Holy Rood": Helpe, crosse, fayrest of tymbris three, In braunchys berynge bothe frute and flowr; Helpe, banere beste, my fon to doo flee, Staf and strencthynge full of socowr; On londe, on see, where that I be, Fro fyir brennynge be me by-forne, Now, Cristis tree, sygne of pyte, Helpe me evir, I be nowght lorne!' The attributes of this cross shade off into periphrases ("banere beste," "Cristis tree, sygne of pyte") that multiply versions of the name. Here again the apparent appeal for help should not obscure the coercive character of the charm, which tells the cross that it is full of succor in order to draw upon the succor. Each of these compositions, for all their differences, attempts to initiate a circular process which will be advantageous to the speaker. Each of them calls upon a source or sources of power which is accorded the kind of extended naming we have already met in invocational poetry. (The Egyptian divinity Hathor is given her strings of red thread.) Each attributes to charged language, and to the actions possibly performed during the composition's utterance, a power similar in kind to the power invoked. The prominence of the phonic element produces a drift away from the semantic while heightening the density and autonomy of the word as object, as in the densely alliterative lines of the Middle English charm ("In braunchys berynge bothe frute and flowr, / Helpe, banere beste, my fon to doo flee"). Meaning is on the way to losing itself in sound:</page><page sequence="5">POETRY AS INVOCATION 499 "Hoc est corpus meum" is threatened by "hocus pocus." Each com- position assumes a bond or correspondence or even identity between word and referent which will be triggered by the utterance and will ensure the operation's efficacy. The sign is reified and energized in order to enter into a network of energized powers which will respond to the claim made by the speaker(s) and complete the circle of demand and fulfillment. The circle will be completed when the desired presence makes itself known, satisfying the wish, relieving the existential hollowness that stems from lack. That pervasiveness of felt lack behind the magical impulse needs emphasis. The Egyptian fragment quoted above is banal in itself and can be matched by innumerable texts from other cultures. But its fiat--"make her be mine!" -can be read in a broader sense as the essential fiat of all magic, which always aims ultimately at possession through appropriation. In spite of the immense diversity of spells, one senses a single profound fiat underlying them all. The obvious command "Obey me!" leads to a second "Belong to me!" and finally to a third "Be mine! Be a part of me!" The apotropaic spell which wards off the malign and the hostile com- plements the will to appropriate what can be made a part of the self. Magic situates its users in a world made tolerable, even docile, through the preemption of their physical and social context. A hostile and undifferentiated Umwelt is mastered and connected with the subject. The crude desire of possession expressed in the Egyptian text can be read as a synecdoche of this fundamental, universal need to appropriate reality. The line between magical invocations and those used in religious cult is not very sharp. A magical element insinuates itself into the "Hymn to Hestia" precisely to the degree that it was felt to be effective, just as analogous elements can be found in Pindar and later classical poets.'" A poet such as Catullus might not have been able to say to what degree the invocation that opens his immensely influential epithalamium (number 61) was coercive, to what degree supplicatory, to what degree conventional: Collis o Heliconii cultor, Uraniae genus, qui rapis teneram ad virum virginem, o Hymenaee Hymen, o Hymen Hymenaee, cinge tempora floribus suave olentis amaraci, flammeum cape, laetus huc</page><page sequence="6">500 NEW LITERARY HISTORY huc veni niveo gerens luteum pede soccum." [O haunter of the Heliconian mount, Urania's son, thou who bearest away the tender maid to her bridegroom, O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus! Bind thy brows with the flowers of fragrant marjoram, put on the marriage veil, hither, hither merrily come, wearing on thy snow- white foot the yellow shoe.] The degree of compulsion is uncertain although the ritual element is strong, and ritual, properly defined, always contains a magical core. The strength of ritual here, visible in the ceremonial cry of lines 4-5 above, which is repeated throughout, can be measured by its diminishment in Catullus's innumerable Renaissance imitations, of which Spenser's is only the best-known ("Ye learned sisters. ... Helpe me mine owne loves prayses to resound.... Ye Nymphes of Mulla. ... Be also present heere.").'2 The magical vestiges, unmistakable still in Catullus, are submerged though not eliminated in Spenser and his contemporaries. Despite the spasmodic and fragmentary use of magical elements through much of ancient poetry, a drift away from magic can be found as early as Sappho, whose only complete extant poem is an invocation to Aphrodite, asking her assistance in winning the favors of a girl the speaker desires-asking such assistance not, as the text makes wryly clear, for the first time. There would be much to say about this devious and playful poem, but it can only serve here to exemplify the firm transformation of spell into poetry. I cite the opening and closing lines: Richly-enthroned immortal Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, weaver of wiles, I pray to you: break not my spirit, lady, with heartache or anguish; But hither come, if ever in the past you heard my cry from afar, and marked it, and came, leaving your father's house .... Come to me now also, and deliver me from cruel anxieties; fulfil all that my heart desires to fulfil, and be yourself my comrade-in-arms.' This abridged text makes it clear that the extended naming pro- longed with attributes common to invocations, followed by the ritual summons, was already available for poetry in the early sixth century. The conditional phrase ("if ever in the past") itself has devotional roots, as Homer, among others, demonstrates.'4 The phonic density of the spell is perpetuated in the original Greek by Sappho's intricate manipulation of sound-effects. But one also discovers in the com- position as a whole, with its rich play of tone and delicate humor,</page><page sequence="7">POETRY AS INVOCATION 501 an inventiveness that resists cultic solemnity and which renders the text a poem. "The incantatory element is already a latent metaphor," writes Charles Segal.'5 With Sappho's ode, which only pretends to summon the goddess, a line is crossed which needs examination. It is true that both spell and poem take their origin in the experience of lack and in a wish that stems from it. The poem like the spell is energized by the wish, which in Sappho as in the Egyptian example takes the form of sexual desire. What distinguishes the two kinds of composition? The Sapphic ode first of all ironizes gently the desire that engendered it, as the speaker recalls previous visits Aphrodite has already made in response to similar appeals: You, Fortunate, with a smile on your immortal face, asked what ails me now, and why I am calling now, And what in my heart's madness I most desire to have: "Whom now must I persuade to join your friendship's ranks? Who wrongs you, Sappho?" (3-4) The Aphrodite of this text is not exactly the goddess who was an object of worship, even if one supposes that Sappho did truly believe in her existence and worshipped her. The Aphrodite of this ode is already a fictional character, as we must suppose that her alleged visits to "Sappho" are fictional. The poem creates an oppositional presence which is a construct, and in the interplay between the speaker and the construct each acquires a definition. Here a teasing dramatic relation emerges between the poetess and the goddess, reinforced by the threefold repetition of the adverb deute (now). The banter mingled with desire requires an effort of understanding on the part of the reader which would be irrelevant in a spell. This relation and the play with tone which evokes it are not teleological; they are not goal-oriented; they are themselves poetic goals. They only require an intuitive recognition from the reader. Thus the poem, as it breaks away from the spell whose form it imitates, involves a fall into interpretation. It shifts the dominant relation away from signifier-referent to signifier-signified. And it imposes a tonal or dramatic frame around the originating wish, a frame which offers a perspective and an attitude to the reader. The attitude in Sappho as we have seen is ruefully and gently ironic; in another poem, such as Theocritus's second idyll, it might be pathetic, even anguished. Spells have nothing to do with tone or attitude and little with meaning; they rather tend to exhibit, in Malinowski's phrase, a "coefficient of weirdness."</page><page sequence="8">502 NEW LITERARY HISTORY The shift from magic to poetry substitutes one kind of satisfaction for another. Magic responds to the libido by trying to satisfy it. Poetry responds by giving it a voice which is unique and which, in one or another guise, circumscribes it. Poetry situates the libido within a frame which acculturates desire without suppressing its force. Desire within the poem, however mysterious it remains, is a force that can be dealt with, apprehended, and contained. Poetry substitutes one crude form of control for a type of indirect control. One might say that in passing from spell to poem, the originating wish is diverted from its intended goal. When, as in Sappho's ode, the magical form is retained, the wish could be said to undergo a process of "conversion," and even when the form fades, the pressure of the wish within a circumscribing frame still produces, though less visibly, the same process. What varies from poem to poem, along with the variation of tone, is the scenario of conversion which each poem acts out. All scenarios of conversion must begin with the fundamental conversion of language itself. The language of the charm privileges sound over meaning while assuming a bond or identity with the referent. Magical words might be taken to suggest the possibility of a perfect language in which phonic echoes would mirror meta- physical correspondences. The passage from spell to poem requires a sacrifice of that utopian possibility and a sacrifice of the word as a charged teleological instrument. The name employed by an in- vocation ceases to be what it had once been, the ideal name.'6 The poem, insofar as it is a poem, renounces the network of metaphysical correspondences in which signs take their place and by which they operate concretely.17 The poem must settle for a scattered world barren of correspondence, and it must settle for provisional meanings emergent from incomplete analogies. The characteristic trope of modern poetry is the metaphor, which is by definition the trope of imperfect and fleeting correspondence, its motive being, according to a twentieth-century practitioner, "the exhilarations of changes." Poetry as scattering breaks up the magical order to assign subtler, more fluid names, names requiring interpretation. It leaves us with metaphors which are quasi denominations, more and less than names. Thus poetry enacts a struggle between the divisive and the inte- grative. Isis is forever piecing together the fragmented body of Osiris.</page><page sequence="9">POETRY AS INVOCATION 503 II The body of English poetry is rich in invocational texts, and it is time now to turn to a few of them. We can begin with one of the many examples in Blake's Poetical Sketches, the lyric entitled "To the Evening Star": Thou fair-hair'd angel of the evening, Now, while the sun rests on the mountains, light Thy bright torch of love; thy radiant crown Put on, and smile upon our evening bed! Smile on our loves; and, while thou drawest the Blue curtains of the sky, scatter thy silver dew On every flower that shuts its sweet eyes In timely sleep. Let thy west wind sleep on The lake; speak silence with thy glimmering eyes, And wash the dusk with silver. Soon, full soon, Dost thou withdraw; then the wolf rages wide, And the lion glares thro' the dun forest: The fleeces of our flocks are cover'd with Thy sacred dew: protect them with thine influence." The conventional name of the evening star, Venus, is withheld, but the first four and a half lines remind us of it; they explicitly link the appearance of the star, a "bright torch of love," with sexuality. The lighting of the torch, the assumption of the radiant crown, are equivalent to the star's making itself visible, an act which will allow it to "smile on our loves," to favor propitiously "our evening bed," although the reference of the possessive adjective is somewhat un- clear. An interesting and slightly mysterious movement away from explicit sexuality then follows, as the benign influence of the star is extended to the crepuscular harmony of a wide landscape. The focus moves from the bed to flower, wind, and lake, thus diffusing and circumscribing the libidinal wish which first seems dominant. The wolf and lion, emblems of aggressive violence, emerge as symbolic antitheses of the star's brief benevolence. The narrow convergence of venereal emanations on a single object is disseminated and partially desexualized as the potency of Venus is perceived as a source of beautiful concord throughout the natural world. The penultimate line, introducing "the fleeces of our flocks," offers a pastoral context which renders the reference of "our" more specific. More significantly, the final line sacralizes that dew already (line 6) evoked as the star's own gift, as a concrete mediation of its influence.</page><page sequence="10">504 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Sexuality-dispersed, redefined, and converted--acquires an aspect of the sacred. "To the Evening Star," once past the opening line, does not appear to supply attributes, which is to say that the name does not appear to be thickened with detail to the degree exemplified by the poem's companion pieces. Thus one might conclude that the apostrophe proper ends with the first line and that the remainder of the poem consists of a richly phrased summons. But that crude division would misrepresent the poem. Many more attributes like the "bright torch" and the "radiant crown" of the third line find their way into the imperatives of the extended summons. More broadly, the imperative clauses which carry the dynamic force of the poem are themselves in effect helping to "name" the star. They invite it to exercise its characteristic functions, those functions which, when well-disposed, it performs typically and uniquely. In effect, the poet asks the star to do what it does, to do its thing, to act as he perceives it to act, so that in this sense the verbs could be read as attributes and the entire poem could reasonably be said to amplify the name, that name which in its divine form is missing. But the poet's perception of the star's marvelous and beneficent functioning is not of course in itself preordained. Another poet would assign somewhat different activities to the star, whose effi- cacious rays would then have a different character. Its "name" would be something else. Only Blake's star disperses its sexual focus on a sacralized landscape. Only Blake's star speaks silence with its glim- mering eyes; only Blake's star is hymned in his particular rhythmic cadences punctuated with abrupt enjambments. Only Blake's star exercises that "influence" which the tropes and rhythms of the poem have defined in the verbal texture concluded by that word. The influence is the sum of the linguistic elements; it would change with the alteration of a single word, so that this is an influence which the reader has never met, could not meet, elsewhere. The poem has in effect constructed an ad hoc oppositional presence never before encountered. The presence is not oppositional because it opposes or threatens, but because it is set over against the speaker as the object of his address. Invocations require that situational opposition creating a space for the vocative to cross. Thus the apparently dual structure of this lyric seems to mingle "name" and summons inextricably. What looks like an address in the vocative followed by a series of injunctions in the imperative is more usefully considered as a single elaborately periphrastic and metaphoric act of denomination denoting an entity previously un- named and unknown. The denomination brings the entity into</page><page sequence="11">POETRY AS INVOCATION 505 being, so that the wish for reception, the wish for the presence of a specific emanation, is a unique wish actualized by the unique text.'9 A remark by Hart Crane is relevant: "It is as though a poem gave the reader as he left it a single, new word, never before spoken and impossible to actually enunciate, but self-evident as an active principle in the reader's consciousness henceforward."20 This sug- gests that the influence desired by the speaker is akin to the enduring experience of the poem carried away by the reader. In each case it is a question of a distinct "active principle," something absorbed which remains at work within the consciousness. If the magical spell can be said always to aim at appropriation, a poem seems to make possible a finer interiorization. The word "influence" retains its original meaning of arcane power; it had been a technical term in astrology, and we happen to know that Blake, not surprisingly, was familiar with that usage.2' One could begin to analyze the scenario of conversion in this invocation by tracing the semantic shift of its last word. The "influence" for us as readers is that lively seed it plants in us. It would doubtless be misguided to attribute to a single lyric of Blake's adolescence too powerful a working force within most readers. But like the other invocational lyrics of Poetical Sketches, "To the Evening Star" in its flawless fragility can serve paradigmatically to exemplify the dynamics of a long series of poems, not all of them so slender. The influence called for by the speaker can be read as an allegory of the power of his text. Blake could have found the invocational structure of his early lyrics most immediately in his preromantic predecessors and notably in Collins and Thomson. But for our purposes, they have less to teach us than do two of the youthful Milton's most celebrated poems, "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso," which are in effect extended in- vocations. The former inverts the order of vocative and imperative, once the mock exorcism of the opposed goddess has finished ("com thou Goddes fair and free, / In Heav'n ycleap'd Euphrosyne, / And by men, heart-easing Mirth").22 But the latter retains the more conventional order we know, interposing twenty lines devoted to attributes and genealogy between the name and the operative verb: Hail divinest Melancholy, Whose Saintly visage is too bright To hit the Sense of human sight; Comrn pensive Nun, devout and pure, Sober, stedfast, and demure .. .*2</page><page sequence="12">506 NEW LITERARY HISTORY In each case, of course, the closing lines reveal the "Com" to be only conditional, in Milton's ludic variation on the invocational structure. But what deserves stress is that special thing which may or may not come, according to the speaker's caprice. The short name, Mirth or Melancholy, serves as an umbrella term; it encap- sulates the immensely complex, freely ranging, definitive and original long "name" which occupies almost all the respective poems. The short name in each case is brilliantly filled out by a set of images which is not predetermined by its umbrella; no one could have predicted, that is, the specific wealth of development the word "Mirth" is accorded as well as its delicate shadings of tone and its answerable rhythms. The result is a complex signified which first appears in the world with this text, a signified which would be altered by the change of a single word or accent. Milton's twin poems differ from other invocations chiefly in the marvelous density of the oppositional presence in each. The chain of attributes, epithets, descriptions, mythologies, fantasies, literary allusions, and intertextual echoes constitutes in each case a macrosign for which no synonym exists- Crane's "single, new word." This singleness needs emphasis because it creates an exception, the exception of the poem, to the semiotic philosophy of Peirce and Derrida, as formulated in Of Grammatology: "Peirce goes very far in the direction that I have called the de-construction of the transcendental signified, which, at one time or another, would place a reassuring end to the reference from sign to sign. I have identified logocentrism and the metaphysics of presence as the exigent, pow- erful, systematic, and irrepressible desire for such a signified. Now Peirce considers the indefiniteness of reference as the criterion that allows us to recognize that we are indeed dealing with a system of signs."24 The poems we have considered, and not only these poems, do in fact arrest the infinite reference (renvoi) from sign to sign, from word to word, because they exclude synonymy. It is true that poems invite paraphrase in the form of interpretation, but the interpreter understands that the paraphrase will always be inade- quate. The signified of the paraphrase may arguably approach the fullness of the complex signified evoked by the poem, but it can never pretend to be its synonym. Thus poems do satisfy the desire for an end to Derrida's indefinite substitutability of signs. They invite the advent of the otherwise unnamable. This presumably is what Plato's Diotima meant when she told Socrates that poetry, like the other arts, calls something into existence which was not there before.25 Thus the two parts of the simple structure we have been</page><page sequence="13">POETRY AS INVOCATION 507 considering--naming and summoning-begin to approach each other as they do in Blake's lyric and as they do in the delphic thought of the later Heidegger: "[Poetic] naming does not hand out titles, it does not apply terms, but it calls into the word. The naming calls. Calling brings closer what it calls."26 It appears to follow that the invocational structure of certain poems can be read as an allegory for the activity of all poetic language. Insofar as poetic language brings into being something previously inexistent or unknown, it exhibits a maieutic power-maieutic rather than epiphanic, as Heidegger sometimes appears to suggest, since there is nothing to be called before the calling. Lacan writes that the goal of a psychoanalysis is the release of the analysand through the pronunciation of a single word which names a desire that has been inchoate up to the moment of its verbalization. "En le nommant, le sujet cr6e, fait surgir, une nouvelle presence dans le monde. Il introduit la presence comme telle, et du meme coup, creuse l'absence comme telle" (In naming it, the subject creates, causes to emerge, a new presence in the world. He introduces presence as such and in so doing hollows out absence as such)." Lacan for one seems to believe in linguistic presence, whatever restrictive limitations it ac- quires in his thought. To the degree that the Lacanian process also depends on a maieutic moment, poetry and psychoanalysis are analogous. Thus the sacrifice required in the conversion from spell to poem appears to find a compensation. The wish that animates both spell and poem is not fulfilled in the poem; it is circumscribed and diverted or allowed to remain in an indefinite future. The magical circle of literal fulfillment remains unclosed. The poem that fails to circumscribe the wish to some degree begins to drift toward the status of spell. But the wish acquires in the poem a precision of voicing of which the spell is incapable. A precarious metaphoric or mythic construct, an anthropomorphism, is projected upon the world which, in the very act of projection, makes possible an assimilation. To evoke the oppositional presence is already to take it in. Projection and assimilation are two moments of a single activity, two moments separated somewhat artificially in the structure of an invocation. In this circle, already present in all human use of signs but heightened by art, lies that true magic which makes us human. Coercive magic, shamanistic magic, can be regarded as a literalized performance, a misplaced concretization, of the capacity for creating anthropo- morphisms, that power to organize and control and assume the world which the use of signs, including the motivated signs called</page><page sequence="14">508 NEW LITERARY HISTORY symbols, makes possible. If, as Hegel thought, the fundamental vital activity is appropriation, then poetry is a schooling in that activity which coercive magic parodies.28 Does the heightened circular power of art, and specifically of poetry, operate upon the writer, or the semifictive speaker of his compositions, or the reader? We know too little about authorial experience to generalize about it, although it would seem ill-advised to exempt the writer, being human, from an experience which remains in some measure universal. But the self within the poem, which is a partially fictionalized stylization of the writer, does initiate that precarious circle which, within the fictive boundaries of the poetic utterance, calls a new active principle into being. The reader participates in that verbal experiment, projecting his/her interpre- tations upon it in order to interiorize the speaker's dramatized interiorization. Thus the reading of poetry involves a double cir- cularity; that active force at work within the reader's consciousness is itself an experience of an anterior experience. The anterior, dramatized experience can act as model, positive or negative, for the reader; it can even serve as a critique. It is true that the circle of assimilative projection is subject to distortions and pathologies, all of them discernible in poetic texts. The symbol projected may be manipulative or it may be tarnished by history. The self which would assimilate the constructed reality may prove too incoherent to succeed. The speaker may be repelled or bewildered by that "reality" he or she might choose to name. Or, as in a poem like Baudelaire's "Obsession," the very use of signs may be abhorrent, so that the speaker yearns for a semiotic vacuum which he will never find: Comme tu me plairais, 6 nuit! sans ces etoiles Dont la lumiere parle un langage connu! Car je cherche le vide, et le noir, et le nu! (O night, how you would please me without these stars whose light speaks a language too familiar! For I seek what is empty and black and naked!)29 The projection may be so private that its obscurity renders assim- ilation impossible to the reader. These pathologies and others can problematize or paralyze the circular calling which is receiving. They are particularly writ large in "modern" poetry, which according to Hugo Friedrich needs to be analyzed largely in negative terms. But the existence of distorted versions need not obscure the norm.</page><page sequence="15">POETRY AS INVOCATION 509 What if the oppositional presence is negative, destructive, poi- sonous? Seneca's Medea opens with a long, chilling invocation by the sorceress of the divine powers, both higher and lower, to assist in murder. What does that allegorize? One can conceive of an apotropaic function of art which would exorcise a speaker's besetting demons, converting the homicidal venom of a Medea or of the historical figure Archilochus from literal to figurative elimination. Picasso's speculations seem to envisage such a role for the visual arts. But this exorcistic function is not incompatible with an inter- iorization which is a salutary release. The word which releases Lacan's patient is presumably a threatening word escaping from repression. "As a man is, So he Sees," wrote Blake. "As the Eye is formed, such are its Powers."30 Those powers are exerted in poems of experience as well as of innocence. Thus "London" exemplifies the purifying release achieved by the naming of the terrible. Dark poetry enacts a ritual of cleansing by finding adequate language to name a per- ceived pollution. In the "marking" and the "hearing" of the speaker in "London"-and both of those activities in context combine re- ception with imaginative projection-the unspeakable is admitted to consciousness, and in this admission we can suppose the speaker to be liberated. His language distinguishes itself from the impotent cries around him; it allows him to take the city as he names it into himself, as the reader is enabled to bring it into awareness. To name pollution is like the naming of desire in Lacan; it is an "action efficace" (effective action). III Barbara Johnson refers to Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" as "perhaps the ultimate apostrophaic poem."3' Perhaps it is also the ultimate invocation in our language. The energy of its vocative address is sustained through the entire first section: O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being, Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing, Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou, Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed</page><page sequence="16">510 NEW LITERARY HISTORY The wingeid seeds, where they lie cold and low, Each like a corpse within its grave, until Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill (Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) With living hues and odors plain and hill: Wild Spirit, which are moving everywhere; Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh, hear!"3 The textual wind of course has little to do with the wind blowing through a wood near the Arno which Shelley's prose note describes. It is indeed hardly a wind at all; it has the virtue of negative capability; it serves chiefly as a flexible conceptual entity to which metaphors can be attached. The interplay of image and metaphor fills up a nearly indeterminate space and creates a fertile new thing of astonishing ramifications. Nowhere is the creation ex nihilo of naming so evident as in this series of vocatives, periphrases, epithets, and metaphors. The "west wind" is an entity mingling strands which are political, artistic, metaphysical, and existential, strands which will be further thickened in the following two sections. These in effect extend the address to the wind by a progressively freer association of attributes expressed as actions, not unlike the attribute-activities attributed by Blake to the evening star. The awesome dynamism energizing Shelley's oppositional presence doubtless stems from the force of the wishes reflected in the meta- phors that animate it. The opening three sections reveal a wish for deliverance from pollution (the "pestilence-stricken multitudes"); they reveal a wish for the cleansing destruction of a coming storm, which will be at once political and internal; they reveal a comple- mentary wish for a tumultuous radical renewal, a wish for the cold inhumanity of the subaqueous, a wish for the power to transform death into life, as the natural cycle transforms the dead seed into living hues and odors, a wish finally to be heard. This cluster of wishes along with others can only find expression through the detour of the construct whose metaphorization offers them an outlet. The metaphors are drawn from a world which is truly scattered, leading the reader through abrupt and jagged shifts like the movement in the third section from drowsy palaces to submarine growths. What matters most doubtless about these metaphors is the inevitable conversion they impose on the wish in the very process of giving it being. The wish is synthesized and harmonized by the overde- termined images of the poem, images which "refine" and filter,</page><page sequence="17">POETRY AS INVOCATION 511 render more precise in the act of recasting, displacing, transferring. I take the penultimate fourth section of Shelley's ode to represent a mistaken version of the productive relationship which the ode is now seeking between the speaker and the turbulent energy he has called into being. In that section emerges a wish for passivity, a wish to lie without volition in the wind's power: If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear; If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee; A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share The impulse of the strength, only less free Than thou, O uncontrollable! (11. 43-47) But this wish accompanies its mirror opposite: an impulse of em- ulation which proves a blind alley as the speaker strives with the wind, recalls a desire to "outstrip" it, and ends bloody and chained. The crude wish to share, to imitate, to be the wind is exposed and ironized. The speaker wants on the one hand to give up his own autonomy, revealing as he does a profound weariness of the self. But he also reveals an assertive egocentrism which forms the other side of his self-rejection. Neither aspect will allow the closure of the projective circle. The true release appears with astonishing and naked candor in the final section: Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is: What if my leaves are falling like its own! The tumult of thy mighty harmonies, Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone, Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce, My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one! Drive my dead thoughts over the universe Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth! And, by the incantation of this verse, Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind! Be through my lips to unawakened earth</page><page sequence="18">512 NEW LITERARY HISTORY The trumpet of a prophecy! 0, Wind, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind? (11. 57-70) The section displays a series of shifts from its opening to its close. The "lyre" of line 57, presumably an Aeolian harp, retains something of the passivity of the preceding section but will be replaced by the clarion trumpet (1. 69). There is a shift from the falling leaves (1. 58) to the sparks of the unextinguished hearth (11. 66-67). There is a shift from the wind as enchanter (1. 3) to the speaker as source of an incantation (1. 65). There is a shift from the sadness of autumn (11. 60-61) to the hope of spring (1. 70). The pivotal moment for all these shifts coincides with the extraordinary articulation of the Ur-wish: "Be thou me!" (1. 62). To the degree that the ode is a political poem and the cleansing it anticipates is European, that wish is megalomaniac. But to the degree that the deepest yearnings are private-and the balance surely tips in this direction-the interior- ization of the metaphoric construct can be seen to close an immense circle of assimilative projection constituted by the entire poem. The entire poem names and summons. It illustrates the release and the self-enrichment of a circle which is not narcissistic and which is not vulgarly acquisitive. The speaker cannot surrender his individuality and his will to become the wind, as he had misguidedly wanted to do in the disastrous fourth section. But the wind as a metaphoric construct can be assimilated by the speaker, who would then retain the emergent selfhood gathering definition as he speaks. Indeed, the act of naming by an autonomous subject, and "naming" in particular with this degree of vocative intensity, are inseparable from interiorization; as we have seen, the temporal separation of the two moments is artificial, since to evoke is to intuit. The final metaphor quietly underscores the process of interiorization, since the wind as "breath" (1. 1) passes through the speaker's lips in order for the prophecy to be sounded. The sounding of that prophecy remains in the future, as does the arrival of spring; from this perspective, nothing has changed. What has changed is that the "clarion" of spring, opposed to the speaker in the first section (1. 10), is now his own. The multiple wishes we have divined through the dense imagistic orchestration have not been directly satisfied; in fact, a crude version of their satisfaction has been exposed as self-destructive in section four. But at the close they have been converted "by the incantation of this verse"; that is to say, an alternative release has occurred. With that phrase, the one allusion to the projective force of this ode, the poet's withered leaves become living sparks from an unextinguished hearth.</page><page sequence="19">POETRY AS INVOCATION 513 It is true that a residual pathos undeniably remains. But the poem has acted out with exemplary force the precarious performance required of us to exist and to grow with sanity in a scattered world. The invocational structure of language permits a reading of the culminating summons "Be thou me!" which is neither ironic nor deconstructive. The joy at the close, which no deconstructive reading can plausibly suppress, is released by a conversion of clustered wishes. If the poem has created an active principle which can work within us, then it has provided an illustration of that circular animation we require against the deadening threat of spiritual poverty. A speaking, perceiving subject has gained a measure of coherence. The ode is not an "incantation" (1. 65) in the sense of the shaman but in the sense of that universal insecure magic ap- propriate to us as human beings. "Poetry makes nothing happen."33 Auden's dictum has become a cliche. Not all readers remember that by the end of the elegy for Yeats where it appears, poetry becomes capable of making many things happen, the most important kind of things: With the farming of a verse Make a vineyard of the curse. In the deserts of the heart Let the healing fountain start. (249) Poetry makes nothing happen as magic, but by constructing intricate and irreplaceable signifieds, by calling things into being which can be interiorized in a living consciousness, it succeeds sometimes in that feat of animation which apostrophe claims to perform. This may not be precisely Picasso's thought, but poetry like painting relies on an insecure operation more common than either, an operation permitting a minimal intuitive control over an otherwise intangible universe. Poetry celebrates, heightens, and tests the act of the mind which situates us as subjects, provisionally and contin- gently, in the postmagical disorderly world.

Their mood is never purely descriptive but always optative or imperative: what description enters is ritual in character." The essay that follows can be read in part as a commentary on the implications of Hartman's pun.

Although most of his odes are not circumscribed by an invocational structure, they characteristically begin with a richly orchestrated address and many add an explicit or implicit summons. I cite the opening of a characteristic Pindaric ode, "Olympia 14": You who have your dwelling in the place of splendid horses, founded beside the waters of Kephisos: O queens of song and queens of shining Orchomenos: Graces; guardians of the primeval Minyai, hear!

I am indebted for this reference to my former colleague Sheila Murnaghan. 15 Charles Segal, "Eros and Incantation: Sappho and Oral Poetry," Arethusa, 7 (1974), 154. 16 Michel Foucault localizes a comparable loss in Renaissance reflection upon the tragedy of Babel: "Languages became separated and incompatible with one another only in so far as they had previously lost this original resemblance to the things that had been the prime reason for the existence of language. All the languages known to us are now spoken only against the background of this lost similitude, and in the space that it left vacant" (Michel Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences [New York, 1973], p. 36). 17 A poem by Emily Dickinson may be relevant in this regard: Prayer is the little implement Through which Men reach Where Presence-is denied them. They fling their Speech By means of it-in God's Ear- If then He hear- This sums the Apparatus Comprised in Prayer. Emily Dickinson, "Prayer is the little implement," in Final Harvest: Emily Dickinson's Poems, ed. Thomas H. Johnson (Boston, 1961), p. 101. I take it that this poem underscores the absence of a divine response to prayer (God's hearing ends the process; nothing more can be expected) and thus articulates the inefficacy of our calling upon Him. 18 William Blake, "To the Evening Star," in The Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed.

Riffaterre's theory presupposes a "matrix," a word or phrase which underlies the poem but which typically does not appear in it explicitly; rather the poem constitutes a "greater or lesser expansion of the matrix's components" (p. 12). The poem, according to him, expands periphrastically a familiar stereotype or cliche abundantly familiar to the reading audience. I would argue rather that poetry invents a unique content for a given word, as Blake invents one for his star or as, in an example to be discussed below, "L'Allegro" invents a content for "mirth" which does more than actualize or expand what that word could be perceived a priori to contain. Poetry is not a Cusanian explicatio. To the degree that a versified text expands a stereotype rather than offering a unique, new, complex signified, it fails to interest its readers as a poem. 20 Hart Crane, "General Aims and Theories," in The Poet's Work, ed. Reginald Gibbons (Chicago, 1989), p. 182. 21 On 14 Oct. 1807 Blake wrote a letter to Richard Phillips, the editor of a monthly periodical, protesting the arrest of an astrologer and appealing for understanding of his alleged misconduct.- "The Man who can Read the Stars," writes Blake, "often is oppressed by their Influence." The letter appears in Erdman, Poetry and Prose, p. 706. 22 John Milton, "L'Allegro," in The Poetical Works ofJohn Milton, ed.

Jacques-Alain Miller (Paris, 1978), II, 267. 28 Hans-Georg Gadamer paraphrases this thought of Hegel's: "Life is determined by the fact that what is alive differentiates itself from the world in which it lives and with which it remains connected, and preserves itself in this differentiation. The self-preservation of what is alive takes place through its drawing into itself everything that is outside it. . . . The fundamental fact of being alive is assimilation (Aneignung). ... This structure of what is alive has its correlative in the nature of self-consciousness. Its being consists in its being able to make everything the object of its knowledge, and yet in everything that it knows, it knows itself. . . . The only way of grasping life is . . . to become aware of it" (Hans-Georg Gadamer, Truth and Method, ed. Garrett Barden and John Cumming [New York, 1975], pp. 223-24). I take it that Gadamer is here paraphrasing the fourth section of Hegel's Phenomenology of the Spirit. Appropriation, Aneignung, acquires a more specifically linguistic character in the late Heidegger, who complicates its meaning in his German text with various plays on words. I cite a representative passage in translation: "Saying, which resides in Appropriation, is qua showing the most appropriate mode of appropriating. . Saying is the mode in which Appropriation speaks. . . . For appropriating Saying brings to light all present beings in terms of their properties-it lauds, that is allows them into their own, their nature" (Martin Heidegger, "The Way to Language," in his On the Way to Language, tr.

Johnson's brief but powerful deconstructive reading of Shelley's ode, focusing as it does on the interplay of animation and death, seems to me finally to fall short because the representation of death in the ode receives less than full justice in her interpretation. "The wind animates by bringing death, winter, destruction," writes Johnson. "How do the rhetorical strategies of the poem carry out this program of animation through the giving of death?" (p. 187). But the poem repeatedly represents death as a forerunner of rebirth, as the first stanza demonstrates. Shelley recalls the belief, at least as old as the Bible, that the seed must die in the earth if the plant is to grow. Thus the reference in lines 7-10 to "the winged seeds ... / Each like a corpse within its grave, until / Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow / Her clarion." The growth of life out of death will be reaffirmed in the final stanza: "Drive my dead thoughts over the universe / Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!" (11. 63-64). Johnson suppresses this sequence whereby death precedes birth and makes it possible, and in so doing she seems to me to misrepresent the poem's dialectic. 32 Percy Bysshe Shelley, "Ode to the West Wind," in Selected Poetry, ed.
