And who would want to hear love reduced to that? Is the heart but a pump and not the seat of the soul? Though science may clock the beats of a racing pulse, such a sterile accounting of the muscle in our breast is cold and, well, blood less. Isn't such a heartless picture of the world always what science leaves us with after it has explained (or explained away) some previously mysterious miracle of nature? Such antipathy toward science and its pur ported effects is probably more common than scientists would like to admit. The German sociologist Max Weber was the best-known figure to articulate this worry about science. In his 1918 lecture "Science as a Vocation," for instance, Weber spoke of the "disenchantment of the world," which he suggested is the result of its modern worldview. He thought that the scientific idea that everything in nature can, at least in principle, be explained in natural terms effectively drains the world of mystery and thereby of transcendent purpose and mean ing as well. For many, the world as science explains it is a bleak and unfeeling place. Of course, given the often exaggeratedly im personal way in which many scientists have described the goals of objectivity and quanti fication, there is a sense in which science has brought this plague upon itself. In the past, physics, especially, contributed to this malaise in its insistence on reducing the world to the inter actions of matter, but another discipline is most often singled out for blame: With the familiar references to the "uncaring" Darwinian struggle, and the "mechanical" and "pitiless" action of natural selection, evolutionary biology has long been the obvious whipping boy for those who are uncomfortable with scientific naturalism. It is not just fundamentalist religious beliefs that motivate creationists' attacks on evolution; they are also driven by a deep existential angst?a fear that evolution renders the world pointless, emptying it of purpose, meaning and morality. George Levine's book Darwin Loves You con fronts Weber's problem of the loss of enchant ment head-on. Levine's thesis is that this all-too common view of science in general and evolution in particular is dead wrong and that, in fact, Dar winian evolution provides a model for what he calls "secular re-enchantment." The aim of the book, in his words, is to enlist Darwin on the side of the angels. keeping with the bumper-sticker comparison of Darwin to Jesus in the title of the book, Levine doesn't hesitate to use religious language, sometimes for its shock effect, to get his point across. He says he will argue for "a re deeming Darwin" who is "an apostle of secular ism." Some readers will find the periodic inser tion of such indirect, unnecessary jabs at religion off-putting, but I hope they can ignore them and focus on the emotionally uplifting view of science with which Levine aims to inspire those who are open to the idea. Evolution, he argues, if properly portrayed, is not only perfectly compatible with meanmgfulness but provides a new basis for it. Levine makes the important point that at the same time that evolution pulls the rug out from under anthropocentrism (which is not only a smug but ultimately a dangerous attitude), it provides a foundation for a justifiable form of anthropomorphism. Darwin showed that hu mans are not the apex of creation but are one with the rest of the biological world, related to all living things through our common ances tors. This discovery allows us to find common ground with other animals without denigrating our humanness, Levine argues, permitting us 528 American Scientist, Volume 95</page><page sequence="2">to legitimately attribute human characteristics (albeit in simpler or incipient forms) to them. This provides an avenue to the re-enchantment of the world, for it shows we are not wrong to find in it a recognizably human notion of mean mgfulness. It is wrong to see nature as cold and unfeeling; for those who understand evolution ary processes and relationships, the biological world becomes a warm and caring network of mutual interactions that are suffused with mean ing. Levine is a romantic, but not a naive one; he does not close his eyes to those aspects of nature that are "red in tooth and claw," but shows how these need not negate the positive vision. Along these lines, Levine does miss one im portant opportunity to extend his argument. He accepts the common view that evolution removes teleology (the characteristic of being directed to ward an end or shaped by a purpose) from na ture, and he fails to see that, by making a move similar to his anthropocenrrism/anthropomor phism distinction, it might be possible to eluci date an evolutionarily legitimate notion of teleol ogy. This could allow a human notion of purpose in nature that is not at odds with the require ments of science. But no matter; the thesis he does defend is correct and important even by itself. When properly understood, scientific research is not passionless but filled with excitement and wonder. With unabashed emotion that is entirely appropriate to his project, Levine again and again shows how evolutionary science can allow one to view the world with awe and reverence. The book is erudite and wonderfully inter disciplinary. In making his case, Levine weaves together a narrative that features the work of not only biologists, but also sociologists such as Weber, historians of science such as Janet Browne and Adrian Desmond, and philosophers from Ren? Descartes, John Stuart Mil and Jean-Jacques Rousseau to William James, Hilary Putnam and Daniel Dennett?not to mention literary figures, including William Shakespeare, John Milton, Wil liam Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Word sworth, George Eliot and Thomas Hardy. An emeritus professor of English at Rutgers University, Levine reads Darwin?not only the Origin of Species and the Descent of Man, but also The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, the H.M.S. Beagle research journals, Darwin's cor respondence and even The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Action of Worms?with a keen eye on his language. The book is especially good in pointing out subtleties in Darwin's choice of words and metaphors and in noting revealing uses of alliteration, personification, passive voice and so on. Levine also highlights the poetry that may be found in Darwin's prose, such as in his precise and yet "literary" description of the amazing thread-aided leaps of the shipboard spi ders he observed while aboard the Beagle. Levine's contention that science can engen der awe and reverence is certainly right, and his Also Reviewed in This Issue 531 GLORIFIED DINOSAURS: The Origin and Early Evolution of Birds. By Luis M.

However, I must note two small but pervasive weaknesses that prevent the book from making its case as well as it might have. Levine mentions that there are hun dreds of examples in Darwin's writings that could illustrate and support his thesis. Anyone who has read Darwin carefully knows this is so, but others do not, and they are the ones Levine needs to reach. Hoping to see more of this enchantment of science revealed, I found myself disappointed that Levine didn't multiply his examples and flesh out his analysis more fully. He might have profitably spent less time saying what he was going to do and more time actually doing it. This fault relates to the book's sec ond weakness, which is the author's self-consciousness. Levine worries aloud that he will be seen as preach ing, as trying to turn evolution into a religion, as assuming the easy middle class lifestyle and forgetting the dis enchanting hardships of poverty, as writing hagiography or as sentimental izing his subject. He does none of these things, but his fretfulness about them calls attention to what ought not to have come up as a problem in the first place. Academic writing cannot help but cover itself with caveats?woe to one who would offer a naked gener alization?but the habit risks obscur ing important insights. (For instance, Levine refers in many places to the sci entific notion of a world governed by laws and to the evolutionary laws that Darwin discovered, but then near the end speaks of "'natural law,' whatev er that might mean," a flippancy that risks undermining his previously seri ous use of that very concept.) And he spends an inordinate amount of time justifying the "risky" bumper-sticker title he gave the book; if one is going to take such a risk, it would be better to do so boldly and without apology. Such weaknesses do not mar David Sloan Wilson's excellent book Evolu tion for Everyone, which tackles some of the same issues (and more besides) in quite a different way. In a brief first chapter that grabs one by the lapels, Wilson states his ambitious goals: that his audience should come to see that evolution can become attractive for ev eryone to learn and so uncontroversial that even evolution and religion can be brought together harmoniously. By the third chapter he has already plunged readers into working out on their own how evolutionary thinking might ex plain patterns of infanticide in nature. The book is chockablock with examples, data, thought experiments and, telling ly, stories?stories about how scientists think and what wonders such thinking can reveal about the world. Moreover, they are stories told with feeling. A professor of biology and anthro pology at Binghamton University, Wil son often draws here on his own evolu tionary research, which ranges from the provision of a sound theoretical basis for group selection, to behavioral stud ies of burying beetles, to the evolution ary value of cooperation and forgive ness. In the service of finding harmony between evolution and religion, he dis cusses some of the evidence for his evo lutionary hypothesis that religions are adaptive at the group level, providing practical benefits relating to the specific The most extraordinary thing about the public's view of evolution, Wilson says, is not that 50 percent dont believe in it, but that nearly 100 percent haven't connected it to anything of importance in their lives. conditions the group is confronted with. Throughout the book, as when he talks about bacterial morality, he conveys an infectious enthusiasm for his subject. Given the central importance of evo lution in biology, the most extraordinary thing about the public's view, Wilson points out, is not that 50 percent don't believe it, but that nearly 100 percent haven't connected it to anything of im portance in their lives. One of Wilson's chief goals?one he accomplishes admi rably?is to demonstrate the relevance and value of evolutionary biology not just to scientists but to ordinary people. story after engaging story, he conveys not only the sweep and the power of evolutionary thinking but the grandeur, as Darwin put it, of this view of life. By the end of the book, the reader under stands Wilson's metaphor that evolu tion is an artist that has helped fashion the sculpture that is the living world. A natural teacher, Wilson also seizes every opportunity to highlight both the ordinary and the distinctive ways in which scientists gather data, test hy potheses and reach conclusions. For instance, a chapter about his research on understanding religion from an evo lutionary perspective begins with an obvious concern: Might not any conclu sions he draws be biased by which re ligions he picks to examine? Of course they might. This leads to a discussion of selection bias and how scientists use random sampling to help avoid it. He then explains how he wrote a comput er program to pick page numbers at random from the 16-volume Encyclope dia of World Religions as a way to get a sample set of religions for his students to examine, rather than make the selec tions himself and perhaps inadvertently stack the deck. There is scarcely a page that doesn't exemplify, either explicitly or implicitly, the way a scientist works on the basis of evidential reasoning. But Wilson's tone is never pedantic or preachy. With only a few exceptions, the writing is light, conversational and filled with apt metaphors and felicitous turns of phrase. In explaining the ubiq uity of groups-as-individuals, for in stance, he writes of how "life emerged as tiny molecular fellowships." He compares an ant colony forcing out the smaller competition as it moves into a rotten log to "a Wal-Mart moving into your neighborhood." The copying of DNA during cell division occurs with the care of "a monk transcribing a holy text." And although Wilson aims for a down-to-earth way of talking about science, to emphasize it as an approach able "roll-up-your-sleeves" kind of ac tivity that anyone might learn to do, at times one finds a hint of the poetic in his language and images. He describes, for instance, one scientist who studies social insects as having been original ly inspired by "the aroma of wax and honey and the spectacle of thousands of bees crisscrossing the summer sky." To contemplate and appreciate that not only our bodies but also our minds and our thoughts are the result of the same evolutionary sculpting action that formed hemlocks, wood turtles, bury ing beetles and cellular slime mold, Wilson says, is both "awesome and humbling." These are the same words Levine uses to express the enchantment that Darwinian evolution makes pos sible. But Wilson has conveyed this en chantment with the world, and with the 530 American Scientist, Volume 95</page><page sequence="4">scientific way of thinking that leads to it, so dramatically throughout his book that by the time he puts the words to page in the last paragraph, readers can't help but understand the point, for he has allowed them to get a sense of the feeling for themselves. Both Levine and Wilson leave one with an important take-home mes sage: that science is by no means in compatible with finding joy, meaning and purpose in the world. Moreover, it may even contribute to such emotional richness, not by divorcing reason and feeling but by yoking them, and an understanding of evolution provides one of the best ways of seeing how this link can be made. The heart may be a pump, but that fact need not prevent one from also seeing it as the seat of the soul. More scientists need to follow Levine's and Wilson's lead in express ing, with feeling, the heart-stirring emotions of awe, beauty and wonder to be found in the scientific view of na ture. Then, perhaps, the general pub lic might come to no longer associate science with loss of meaning and to no longer think it incongruous that a scientist might speak of love. It's an enchanting possibility. Robert T.
