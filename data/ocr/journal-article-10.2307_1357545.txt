In his work, Michael Emmenddrffer closes this gap. As his main point of reference, he uses the latest research on the psalms, which is at present in an auspicious phase of reorientation. The theological subjects covered in these texts range from the condemnation of God as the enemy to the perception of God as the father. 1997. 350 pages (est.) (Forschungen zum Alten Testament ).

ISBN 3-16- 146667-5 cloth US $ 125.00 (est.) -Fall Beat Huwyler Jeremia und die Volker Untersuchungen zu den VOlkersprtichen in Jeremia 46-49 The question regarding the origin and significance of prophecies and poems addressed to non-Israelite nations (the so-called Foreign Nation Oracles) is still receiving very controversial answers from Old Testament researchers. Beat Huwyler analyzes the texts in Jeremiah 46-49, establishes the criteria for distin- guishing between the authentic texts written by Jeremiah and later additi- ons and traces the complex develop- ment of the text. In doing so he focu- ses particularly on the problem of the various final versions in the Masoretic text and the Septuagint. 1997. 440 pages (Forschungen zum Alten Testament).
