<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLU KULE, TARSUS, 19361 ON the ninth of March, 1936, in weather unusually warm and bright for the season, the excavation of the Hiiytik of Gtizlti Kule was resumed. Only one new trench, number eight, was cut. It lies to the south of the mound in a field on which, owing to the proximity of the modern town, all the earth from the excavation has to be dumped. It seemed advisable, before the whole area had been covered, to discover whether it concealed anything of archaeological importance. The trench measured 3.00 m. by 10.00 m. and was dug to a depth of five meters. Up to this point it was filled with drift earth containing a plentiful admixture of modern sherds. At the time it was impossible to carry it to a greater depth for lack of workmen, but another attempt to find undisturbed deposits will be made when the excavations are re- sumed. Section A, which was again in charge of Robert Ehrich, was widened to the east, primarily to get a better understanding of the large building at the three-meter level.2 When discontinued, a section approximately 22.00 m. from east to west and 15.50 m. from north to south had been uncovered. The dig acted as a check upon the evidence from the comparatively small area of last year and gave us a much larger body of ceramic material upon which to base our conclusions. This, taken together with the evidence of Hittite hieroglyphic sealings both from this section and Section B (see p. 280), leave little doubt that the so-called brown or "drab" ware represents the final phase of the Bronze Age and not, as seemed possible at the end of the first campaign," the beginnings of the Iron Age. At the two-meter level, and less than a meter under the soil,4 there were remains of a large building in a very fragmentary state of preservation. At the same level Mycenaean pottery began to appear in fairly large quantities. The accompanying pottery was almost uniformly of the monochrome "drab" variety in which carelessly made plates with 1 The work of the 1936 excavation was supported by: Bryn Mawr College, the Archaeological In- stitute of America, which associated with it Haverford College, and the Fogg Museum of Harvard University. Bay R. Yalgin, Director of the Museum of Antiquities in Adana, again represented the Turkish government and by his energetic action, whenever needed, and his enthusiasm for the work, was of much assistance to the excavators. The work was under the general direction of the writer. Mr. Robert W. Ehrich acted in the same multiple capacities as in 1935 and had under his supervision an even larger force of workmen. Miss Dorothy Cox made all the drawings and plans in addition to supervising a large area of field work. Miss Margaret S. Woods participated in the field work for the first five weeks and later devoted herself to photography and the cleaning and conservation of bronzes. Mr. J. Franklin Daniel arrived in April and remained with the expedition for two and a half months. He divided his time between the supervision of a trench and a study of Mycenaean pottery and Iron Age pottery of Cypriote type. Miss Florence E. Day came to us from Beyrut and devoted herself ex- clusively to preparing the Islamic pottery and lamps for publication. She was able to complete the organization and reconstruction of all the material and was well advancel with the cataloguing and drawing when the 1936 campaign came to a close. Miss Sara Anderson, out on a Bryn Mawr Schol- arship, worked on the reconstruction of terracotta figurines and made a preliminary catalogue. 2 A.J.A.

While there are some carefully turned plates,' the majority are of a coarse, impure clay, without well defined base. Many were merely hacked with a knife from the wheel. Among the more interesting shapes are the trumpet-spouted vessel (Fig. 1) found standing on a bed of ashes in a shallow pit. This pit, like a number of others of the period, was doubtless used for cooking purposes. The lentoid flask, mentioned in the last report, can now be illustrated (Fig. 9), and a type of miniature jug (Fig. 3) which is quite common at this and the lower or three-meter level. The ceramic material and bronzes from these two levels are almost identical. While there is some use of slip at both levels, more bowls and plates with slipped and burnished rims are found at the lower level. Red is the usual color, although brown is also used. This, as we shall see, is a survival of the technique of the preceding period of the Bronze Age. Bronze arrow-points and chisels with both hollow sockets and solid shafts were numerous. Fig. 4 illustrates the more interesting of the clay bullae found at the two-meter level. While the Mycenaean sherds belong to a disturbed area, owing to the shallow covering of humus, and do not permit of much reconstruction of shapes, they are, nevertheless, at approximately their original level. This is amply proven, both by the fact that they are practically restricted to this area and by the evidence of Sec- tion B, and I shall leave the more detailed description and evaluation of the Mycen- aean pottery to the discussion of that section (pp. 279 ff.). Suffice it, for the moment, to say that it belongs uniformly to two phases of the "Granary style." For the trumpet-spouted vessel I know of no parallel, but both the lentoid flask 2 and the very peculiar miniature jug 3 are characteristic of Hittite pottery. The flask, indeed, is an old Anatolian form and, with certain variations in shape, goes back, not only to early phases of the Hittite pottery,4 but also to Troy II.j As the Hittite empire came to an end around 1900, it is evident that on the basis of the ceramic parallels alone one would be forced to place the final appearance of the " drab " ware not much later than this approximate date. In the report of last year one of the reasons given for a later dating was the fact that immediately above the "drab" ware Iron Age pottery of the Cypriote variety appears. The same phenomenon was observed this year in Section B and over a sufficiently large area to make it highly improbable that it was accidental. The problem, therefore, seems to have shifted from one of dating the monochrome "drab" wares to that of finding the correct date for the first appear- ance of the pottery of Cypriote character. Mr. Hamilton, excavating for the Pales- tinian Department of Antiquities,6 assigned some Iron Age pottery to a date as early as the end of the twelfth century or early eleventh. Unless something similar can be assumed for Tarsus, we must take for granted that the mound of Gtizlti Kule, if not all of the more extended city of Tarsus, was deserted for some time. Inher- ently this is not impossible or even unlikely. The twelfth century was a peculiarly 1 A.J.A., l.c., fig. 16. 2 Bittel and Gueterbock, "Bogazk6y," Neue Untersuchungen in der hethitischen Hauptstadt, Taf. 8, 2. 3 Bittel and Gueterbock, op. cit., Taf. 7, 5. 4 Bittel, "Vorlufiger Bericht ueber die Ausgrabungen in Bogazkiy," Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient Gesellschaft zu Berlin, Nr. 74, 1935, fig. 4. 6 C.

GOizlti Kule was an exposed point overlooking an inland basin reached by a navigable river 1 and the inhabitants may here, as elsewhere, have retired inland for safety. The evidence from Section B is not conclusive. There certainly was no accumulation of earth to mark such a hiatus in occupation; and in Section A the last phase of the Bronze Age lies, as has been said, very near the surface. The only way out of our present dilemma would be to assume that the catastrophe which befell the Hittite Empire did not affect Cilicia and that the late Hittite ceramic shapes here continued in use for some time longer. Before the evidence of Tarsus on this important point can be definitely stated, at least one more sector must be opened on the mound. I return now to the description of Section A. Although the building at the three- meter level (Fig. 5)2 was uncovered, as has been said, over an area measuring ap- proximately 9292.00 m. from east to west and 15.50 m. from north to south, this represents in all probability only a fraction of the whole structure. Both to the north and east the walls run into the undug earth. It presents the picture of a large central area-probably an open court-bordered by a corridor somewhat wider on the southern than on the western side. The outer wall, averaging 1.10 m. to 1.90 m., is of heavy construction with large stones on the outside and only slightly smaller ones forming the inner row, while the core is chocked with rubble. This supports a superstructure of crude brick, at the base of which run horizontal, roughly rec- tangular, adze-trimmed beams. Their appearance and dimensions are given in the reconstruction (Fig. 6), while Fig. 7 shows, in the groove visible on the floor, the position in which they lay. For the 5 a/le/. .wnd , c 0:605 FIG. 6.- CROSS SECTION OF WALL SHOWING USE OF HORIZONTAL BEAMS support of the interior wall, of an average width of 0.90 m.-1.00 m., the stone base was naturally neither so strong nor so deep. In the case of these walls, the clay surfacing of the floor had been smeared up over the vertical face of the beams, instead of the wall dressing being carried down to the level of the floor. By means of this technique the joint was covered and moisture could not seep in and undermine the crude brick of the wall. The angle of wall to the west represents the smaller room with cement floor, labelled provisionally the "bath room," of the 1935 report. The drain, which carried off the water, emerges from under the wall at the southeast corner of the room and turns sharply towards the east at the angle of the main room of the building. It can be seen in Fig. 8, at the point where a later wall has broken into it. It is characteristic of the closely built site of Tarsus that walls of successive periods are frequently not more than a few centimeters apart. Of the exact shape of this smaller room little can be said at present. The a If we may believe that early conditions correspond to those of later times. It seems most likely that the Hittites, at the height of their power, at least in the first half of the thirteenth century, kept their water highway open to the chief city of their vassal state of Kizwatna. 2 The stippled walls are of later date.</page><page sequence="5">704~ 46107 JI-07 4006 tJo fh5, ..72A.e 0411;1: t n JLI i rI4/.9' 3662 .0.0 afl6o. 3.50 '4:: il~l ~t$ FIG. 5.-BUILDING AT THREE-METER LEVEL, SECTION A FIG. 7.- WALL OF CRUDE BRICK SHOWING POSITION OF HORIZONTAL BEAMS FIG. 8.-- DRAIN OF BUILDING AT THREE-METER LEVEL, SECTION A</page><page sequence="6">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLU KULE, TARSUS, 1936 967 foundations at the northeast corner of the ground plan correspond in width and alignment with the short western wall to the south, but in view of the havoc caused by the intrusive pits, some of which are of Islamic date, others sunk from the two- meter level of the late Bronze Age, it is impossible to determine whether they were ever connected. A number of small rooms, instead of one long, narrow chamber, may have abutted on the western corridor. In spite of the poor preservation of our building and its very incomplete excavation, one is tempted to speculation. In its present state it presents a picture not unlike the southwest corner of Temple II at Bogazkiy.1 In order to continue the stratigraphic study of the site, which could be profitable only here, as elsewhere in Section A the deep Roman levels had destroyed the last phase of the Bronze Age, a portion of the western side of this building was removed. Instead of finding the traces of other structures immediately below it, we came upon no walls of any size, but uncovered a series of pebble layers to the astonishing number of at least fourteen. They were so well and evenly laid that one questions whether they were a fill or a foundation for the support of the upper building, made up of superimposed layers of earth and river-stones, or a succession of pave- ments covering a larger area. Their extent can only be determined by very careful investigation, which will be the work of some future campaign. At all events, there can be little doubt that they are connected with a building of considerable importance which occupied a commanding position on the highest point of the mound. The monochrome "drab " pottery did not persist in any quantity much below the foundations of the three-meter level building.2 At 4.50 m. the units were almost free of any admixture of this ware and at five meters the character of the pottery, as well as of the houses, had changed completely. Some of this pottery had been found in the first campaign and is illustrated by figs. 15, 20, 22 and 23 of the 1935 report. There, however, it was wrongly said to represent the last phase of the Bronze Age, a r61le which, I now believe, should really be assigned to the monochrome "drab" ware. It is characteristic rather of the preceding phase. It comprises two distinct ceramic styles: wares with simple geometric patterns, often of rather careless exe- cution, on a light ground, and vessels covered either partially or completely with a highly burnished slip. Red is a favorite color, but buff, brown and black also occur. While the burnished wares have very definite Hittite connectiions,3 the painted wares seem to me very unlike the so-called painted Cappadocian found at such sites as Alisar. When the publication of this site has appeared, it will facilitate a comparative study, as not much of the material is in easily accessible museums. Figs. 9-14 illus- trate some characteristic examples of the painted wares. The small high-footed bowl (Fig. 9, p. 264) occurs very frequently. Fig. 10 shows those of a somewhat lower level. Fig. 11, with its effective, but badly planned and executed design, is typical of the careless work of this period. Fig. 12, on the other hand, is much better in execu- tion, and with its dotted rosettes and crossed and dotted triangles suggests Aegean 1 Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient Gesellschaft, Nr. 74, Tafel III. 2 It must be remembered that three meters represent the general level at which the walls first appeared; the floors lie at a lower level, as can be seen from the plan.

All these pieces reveal the potter as an excellent craftsman, as far as the building up of the vessel on the wheel is concerned. The fabric, too, is hard, close- grained, and comparatively free of impurities. Even the monochrome vessels, such as Figs. 13 and 14, are of good proportions and impressive size, although frequently of less well-levigated clay. FIG. 15.-BUILDING OF LOWER BRONZE AGE LEVEL, SECTION A The houses of this period have comparatively narrow stone foundations with a minimum width of 0.45 m. (Fig. 15). The living unit sometimes consists of only two rooms, although it usually forms part of a larger complex with party walls. The hearth, of horseshoe shape on the inside, is frequently situated in the center of the larger of the two rooms. Sometimes it has a simple ornamental design on the front panels of the clay parapet, which protects the actual fireplace from draughts. This is illus- trated by the flutings on the front of the hearth (Fig. 16) which also shows the careful stone bedding and the fre- quent rebuildings of these fireplaces. A number of spit supports were found in connection with hearths, and a quern usually lay somewhere in the immediate vicinity.

It is shown enlarged (Fig. 17, p. 268). It is only at this earlier Bronze Age level, too, that the incised biconical whorls so characteristic of Anatolia, first make their appearance. None has as yet been found in the levels of the "drab" wares. Small metal objects are numerous, but the most important find was a hoard of sixteen pieces of bronze and three of lead at a depth of 5.50 m. They actually repre- sent only eighteen objects, as the two pieces of bronze tubing were originally one. The hoard consists of five flat axes or chisels (Fig. 18) of a simple type and two with lateral protrusions of the type called "aermchen Beil" in German (Fig. 19). This is the first time that this type has been found south of the Taurus mountains,' but it was widespread in all of Anatolia and also occurred in a bronze hoard from Megiddo.2 The pickaxe (Fig. 19) is a particularly fine piece of metal work. A solid chisel and one with socket (Fig. 20), five daggers varying greatly in size (Fig. 21), and three lead rings (not illustrated) complete the hoard. The tubing has a number of small holes at the upper end. It is exactly paralleled at Tell Asmar.3 It was probably used for drinking beer in the manner illustrated on cylinder seals.4 A cache of twenty- one flint blades occurred somewhat above the bronzes. Directly under the three-meter level no seals of either stamp or cylinder type were found, but they again became fairly common at a depth of six meters. A num- ber, among them Fig. 22, with its fabulous beasts in lively motion, were found in ! l disturbed earth. This is of light blue faience and resembles cylinder seals of Assyrian character found in Cyprus.5 Fig. 23 was washed out of the side of a trench by the rain. The unit centering around a paved court 6 at the southern edge of Section A was, after further study, in part removed. Before the construction of this building, the FIG. U2.--CYLINDER SEAL OF LIGHT BLUE FAIENCE FIG. 23.--CLAY BULLA area had been, for a long period, open and somewhat sloping ground. It was this which necessitated the laying of the court pavement over a very heavy underpinning of rough limestone. In the 1935 report it was said that "toward the south the whole complex (of the Terrace building) is sharply cut off," and this year we discovered that the cutting was due to a very heavy stone wall, with an average width of about 3.30 m., and at some points considerably wider. Just what the date of the wall is cannot be said with certainty as yet, but a series of ovens along the south face, of which four have been at least partially excavated, certainly belong to the Iron Age and were used for the manufacture of Black-on-Red and White-Painted wares of 1 S.

This is amply proven by the numerous misfired pieces lying both inside the ovens and in the general area. There is every reason to believe that when the excavation is carried further along the face of the wall, we shall find more ovens attesting the fact that Tarsus was a center for the manufacture of much of the "Cypriote" Iron Age pottery used locally. Mr. Daniel, who made a special study of these wares, says that of the "Iron Age" pottery from one given area in Section B he believes about 20 per cent to be import and 80 per cent of local manufacture, and adds: "I did not find a single Cilician piece in Cyprus." The ovens were built in a hard mass of burned clay and pebbles, lying directly in front of the stone wall. The sides were strengthened with stones, and the fire-chamber, built of the same material, was reached through an arched opening. A floor of thick clay overlay it and was pierced at frequent intervals by holes for the penetration of the heat. On this the pots stood during the process of firing. The oven, which was most thoroughly ex- amined, had a length of 3.75 m. and was shaped somewhat like a pointed leaf, with the opening of the fire-chamber at the narrow end. Sections Four and Five of the 1935 campaign were this year thrown into one by the removal of the embankment which had supported the railway and will in future be referred to as Section B. Miss Woods and Mr. Daniel shared at different times the supervision of this sector with Miss Cox, who, however, finally took over the whole area. A slight rectification of the outlines along both the eastern and the west- ern boundaries permitted us once more to follow the successive cultural levels. The ground level at this point was at G9.25-9.50 m. Directly under the surface lay a group of Islamic graves. The pottery in the earth around them was naturally very mixed, including a large percentage of Roman; for the Islamic level had every- where disturbed the upper Roman strata. At 11.00 m. lay a Roman grave and fragments of the fine thin lamp disks characteristic of the last pre-Christian era and early first century A.D. At roughly @11.50 m. Rhodian stamped amphora handles were fairly common. At approximately @12.00 m. Roman red glazes and "Perga- mene" virtually disappear in favor of Hellenistic fabrics, and the amphora handle with the signature Philodamos gives us a date around 200 to 180 B.c.1 At an average depth of e12.25 to 12.50 m. lay the Hellenistic house with bath, discussed in the 1935 report. More of this complex was uncovered this year. At approximately the same level, @12.35 m., a pebble mosaic (Fig. 24), which seems to have paved the entrance to a building lying east of the one just mentioned, came to light. Except for breaks around the edges the mosaic is in a fair state of preservation. It is com- posed in three colors; white, red and blue-black. Within a border showing succes- sively wave, cable, and egg-and-dart patterns, there lies a narrow central panel flanked by two wider ones. In the center four dolphins are arranged symmetrically around a flower or rosette enclosed in a circle. The side panels contain circles and palmettes. Fig. 25 shows the details of the pattern, which is pleasing, chiefly on ac- count of the graceful dolphins in the central panel, and in spite of the extraordinary carelessness of the design, illustrated by the variations in the size of the palmettes and circles. It looks as if it had been laid without the help of a measured drawing. It compares unfavorably with pebble mosaics known to belong to the fourth century, 1 V. Grace, Hesperia, III, 3, 1934, p. 296.</page><page sequence="12">FIG.

The shape of the palmettes and also the accompanying ceramic material suggest a date not earlier than the very end of the fourth, more probably the third century. This is further supported by a number of silver tetradrachms, two of Alexander and one of Lysimachus found at about the same level. Between the levels of 11.25 and 11.50 m., and all within a small space, four terra- cotta fragments were found which are of considerable interest (Fig. 96). It will be seen at a glance that, although not from the same mould, they all represent parts of the same monument. A two-stepped base is surmounted by an Ionic half column between half pilasters. In each compartment thus formed, a shield and dagger hang against the wall. In the triangle of the steeply rising pediment, the sides of which are slightly concave, stands the well-known figure of the god Sandon, as he was represented on coins from the Seleucid period to the time of the emperor Galli- enus. From the coins we know that the pediment was surmounted by an eagle. The monument, of which the terracottas are a copy, does not correspond in detail to any one numismatic representation. I know of none with the shield and dagger. The base, too, is usually lower and broader, with garlands festooning the wall. On our terracottas Sandon holds the double axe and wreath and wears quiver and sword. He is mounted on the horned lion, which is flanked on either side by low circular altars. According to the British Museum Catalogue of Coins, "The erection in which he (Sandon) is represented as standing on some of the coins, is either a permanent monument or the pyre which was burned in his honor at the annual Tarsian festival called Trbpa." 2 The evidence of the terracottas seems to me to favor a permanent monument. The heavy vertical relief lines to either side of the mounted figure sug- gest that it represents an actual cult statue: a bas-relief such as was not uncommon in the Orient. One may compare the stele of Amrit.3 A comparison of the terracottas with cylinder seals shows that many other features of the monument are oriental.4 Even in the steep triangle of the pediment there may be a reminiscence of the aniconic form of the deity as it appears mounted on an animal and facing the anthropomorphic deity on such seals as one of Cappadocian style found at Byblos.5 If we consider that among the hun- dreds of terracotta figurines found last year in Section A there was not a single representation of the oriental Sandon, although a great many of his Greek equiv- alent, Herakles, it seems possible that these are actual offerings from the immediate neighborhood of the shrine and that we are not far from the site of this important monument. We hope to look for it in the 1937 campaign. The date of our terracottas, too, is of interest. They were found, as we have said, between the 11.00 m. level, which was Roman of the first centuries B.C.-A.D. and 012.00-192.50 m., probably belonging to the third century B.c. The Sandon figure appears for the first time on 1D.

Its representation on the coinage may indeed commemorate a rebuilding of the monument by the new rulers. The mosaic was retained, the contemporary Hellenistic structure removed. Immediately beneath it the remains were insignificant, and at about @13.50 m. the whole southern part of Section B was covered with a fairly heavy dressing of pounded poros and clay. This was undoubtedly an artificial leveling and resurfacing, intended to cover an enormous deposit of refuse and broken potsherds which had been dumped in this area. That it was really a dump, and not a gradual accumula- tion, was amply proven by the fact that no chronological sequence could be ob- served in the ceramic material for a depth of about one meter. Indeed, pieces of the same pot were scattered throughout the deposit. Then, too, the quantity of potsherds was far greater than in any of the areas where they had accumulated gradually. The earth, too, was looser in texture, had a dirty black look, and was mixed with ashes. At frequent intervals during the dumping process, attempts were made to level it off, and various irregular and very sloping "floors" or "pavements" were isolated. They ran, for the most part, rather sharply from south to north. Many of them were, in reality, little more than drift levels hardened by the constant flow of water from numerous drains which emptied in this region. In the north end of the section (the original Section 5), it will be remembered that pottery of the early sixth or late seventh century I had been found just before the close of the 1935 campaign. The building directly over this level was removed this year, and the lower one was found to lie along a narrow street or alley running north- south, with a stone sill at the south end under which passed a drain (Fig. 27, p. 273). The street was long in use and had been resurfaced at least four times. The building which lay to the west of the street showed the same continuous use with slight rebuildings over a considerable period of time. Most of the floors were relaid at least four times (Dc. 13.00 to e13.60 m.). Of course, in the case of these dirt floors with thin clay dressing, renewals are frequent, but in the one paved room or court too, the stone flagging had been twice renewed. To the west this building has not been completely excavated. As far as it has been uncovered, it represents a complex of nine rooms, in two cases separated by walls of unbaked brick without stone founda- tion. Five of the rooms communicate by well-preserved doors. The stone walls are badly built in comparison with those of the Hellenistic level. They are composed of rough-hewn material, varying greatly in size and irregularly laid. The average width is 0.75 m. to 0.85 m. and the height about 0.80 m. This probably represents the original height of the foundation on which the crude brick was laid. In the narrow room towards the south, Assyrian clay tablets (cf. Fig. 37A, p. 280) were found, unfor- tunately not lying on the floor, but in the composition of the floor itself, and also in the earth below the floor. They belong to the seventh century, therefore to the period after the conquest of Sennacherib (see the account of Dr. Goetze, p. 288), a date sub- stantiated by the accompanying finds, of which I shall mention only a Corinthian kotyle with a bird in white paint on a black background and a figurine of the Mother 1 A.J.A., l.c., figs. 41-43.</page><page sequence="16">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLU KULE, TARSUS, 1936 277 and Child type (Fig. 28, p. 275), in this case probably the goddess Astarte. The terra- cotta, of a very impure clay and not well fired, was evidently made locally. At the level of this house the ceramic material begins to be preponderantly Cypriote Iron Age in character, although there are also a number of local wares and shapes. Of these the most characteristic are bowls with stepped profiles (Fig. 29, p. 275) of plain or red-slipped clay; high-stemmed, very poorly made goblets (Fig. 30), and a rather fine buff ware ornamented with thin red stripes. Characteristic shapes for the last are a piriform jar and a calyx-like bowl on a solid high stem (Fig. 31). This does not exhaust the list of non-" Cypriote" wares. Much use is made of a rather metallic glaze, brown or red in color for simple geometric patterns, usually on a light clay background, and there are local varieties of bichrome wares. Frag- ments of Rhodian orientalizing style also appeared at approximately this level. Characteristic of the architecture of this period is the use of stone bases into which the wooden pillars or roof-supports were socketed and the frequent use of inner walls of brick. The typical oven consists of a circular clay floor, surrounded on three sides by a parapet of clay, supported by either large potsherds or clay plinths. The para- pet, when composed of plinths, is sometimes angular, but as a rule it follows the curve of the oven floor. The whole structure through constant firing was burned hard. Bronze fibulae are of the angular knobbed type (Fig. 32), found not only in Cy- prus, but, like the Iron Age pottery itself, along the eastern end of the Mediter- ranean coast in Syria and Palestine as well. Fig. 33 shows the characteristic bronze arrow heads with single barb. The bronze of which they are made seems to be harder than that used for pins, and, consequently, they survive in a better state of pres- ervation. A truly amazing number of iron tools and implements of every sort was found: knives still showing traces of the wooden haft (Fig. 34), awls, sometimes to- gether with their bone handles (Fig. 35), a plow, a large axe-adze and chisels. Stone celts and pounders were also used, but they were not numerous. A short iron knife with traces of a wooden handle which had been ornamented with ivory disks at- tached by bronze rivets, was unique. Innumerable were the small grotesque terra- cotta figures, chiefly of horses and riders (Fig. 36). At this general level, too, were found faYence seals (Fig. 37).1 They show the customary designs of hieroglyphs and other Egyptian motifs, such as the sphinx, the hawk and the boat with high-curving prow and stern (not illustrated), or a simple design of petals. The Cypriote Iron Age elements increase in quantity from @13.00 m. down and are at their maxi- mum between @13.50 m. and e14.50 m. There was a second building level, with about the same orientation as the one just described, but neither so well built nor so well preserved, with floors from about e13.70 to e14.00 m. At e14.00 m. there was every indication of great disturbance and although, unlike the area to the south, this northern half of Section B contained houses at this level, the thin, poorly preserved walls, the uneven, badly dressed floors, showed that the dwellings were little, if any, above the level of squatters' huts. This section of B was left at this level, and the work for the last month con- centrated on the southern half, with the intention of uncovering more of the large 1 Enlarged in the illustration to twice the actual size.</page><page sequence="17">FIG. 32. - BRONZE FIBULAE FIG. 33.--BRONZE ARROW HEADS FIG. 34. -IRON KNIVES FIG. 35.--IRON AWLS</page><page sequence="18">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLU KULE, TARSUS, 1936 279 FIG. 36.- TERRACOTTA FIGURINES OF RIDERS house described in the 1935 report.' Pieces of Mycenaean pottery of the Granary style had been turning up sporadically in the much disturbed earth of this region, but between approximately the fifteenth and sixteenth meter it became the charac- teristic ware and represented a higher proportion of the total ceramic material than painted wares did at any other level. It was mixed with a certain amount of the "drab" pottery. Again, as in Section A, the pottery immediately above the Mycenaean was that of the Cypriote Iron Age. Owing to the ubiquitous intrusive pits, which here, on account of the erosive action of water on their sides, often spread to enormous proportions, there was much confusion and Iron Age sherds were carried to considerable depths below their original level. Wherever an undis- turbed area could be isolated, however, the Iron Age and the Mycenaean were never found together. The pits varied greatly in character. While some had obvi- ously been dug in order to receive drainage water, others were shallow and lined with broken poros. These were probably used as silos for the storage of grain, a practice which may be observed in the modern villages of the region. Others, not as shallow as the silos nor as deep as the drains, were filled with miscellaneous rubbish and refuse of all kinds. It was not uncommon to find the top of such a refuse pit either chocked with stones or sealed over with clay. The purpose of this becomes evident when one learns that one pit, for example, contained the hide and some of the bones of a black goat. A living goat cannot be classed among the good neighbors. No won- der that even in those early and doubtless less fastidious days, the inhabitants of 1 A.J.A., .c., pp. 544 ff.</page><page sequence="19">FIG. 37. - FAiENCE SEALS FIG. 37A.- ASSYRIAN TABLET FIG. 39.- HITTITE LAND DEED FROM SEALED REFUSE PIT FIG. 40.--BULLA WITH IMPRESSION OF SEAL OF QUEEN PUDU- UEPA FROM REFUSE PIT r244 0 FIG. 40.- DRAWING OF SEAL SHOWN AT LEFT</page><page sequence="20">EXCAVATIONS AT GOZLUT KULE, TARSUS, 1936 281 Tarsus felt the need of insulating the carcass of this defunct goat by some primitive method. It was our good fortune to find such a sealed refuse pit at the Mycenaean level. It contained two sherds of a single Mycenaean pot of panel style (Fig. 38), a frag- mentary Hittite tablet recording a land deed (Fig. 39),' some insignificant bronze fragments and a bracelet composed of small faience beads strung on bronze wire. Most important of all the finds were a large number of clay bullae with Hittite hieroglyphs, among them a bilingual one which could be identified as that of Pudu- hepa, the wife of Hattusil III (Fig. 40).2 Her name appears, together with that of her royal husband, on the famous treaty signed after the battle of Kadesh. She is there referred to as "the lady of Kizwatna." The reign of Hattu'il belongs to the first half of the thirteenth century 3 and Pudu-tlepa seems to have survived him, for she probably acted as regent for her son.4 I think the contents of the refuse pit can- not be much later than the actual lifetime of the queen. Such clay sealings as the bullae represent, when once removed from the objects they protected, could have had no value and would have been almost immediately discarded. That the contents of the pit do not represent a gradual accumulation over a period of years is proved by the fact that the two pieces of Mycenaean ware (Fig. 38), which were found to join, lay respectively at the top and the bottom of the pit. I think it could not have been filled in and sealed much after the third quarter of the century. But the pit does not represent the latest level at which Mycenaean is found, for its edge was at e 15.75 m. The Mycenaean pottery, if we accept the evidence of the bulla as con- clusive, probably persisted until the end of the century, but not very much beyond. I quote from Mr. Daniel in the following account. It should be emphasized that he is responsible only for what appears in smaller print and not for the general views on dating which I have expressed. This can readily be seen from his own report. I am fully aware that further excavation may bring more decisive evidence, but it seemed worth while to state the conclusions that can, I believe, legitimately be drawn from the presence of the queen's seal and the Hittite land deed at this level. "The painted pottery found between the 15.15 and 15.90 meter levels in the southern half of Section B at Tarsus is almost without exception imported Mycenaean of the so-called Granary Class (Figs. 41, 42). Wace has shown (B.S.A. XXV, pp. 30 f., 40 f., etc.) that pottery of the Granary Class was in use at Mycenae at the time of its destruction. It was present in large quantities in the burnt debris of the palace; it also occurred in the last preceding level, and was characteristic of a brief period of reoccupation after the destruction. Similar pottery has been found at several other Greek sites, and most recently in the Homeric city of Troy. That it is to be associated with the final disaster of the Mycenaean civilization is now generally believed. Three varieties of the Granary Class were found at Mycenae. Most common was a light ground ware decorated with very simple patterns in a vaguely lustrous black or brown paint. The second group consists chiefly of open bowls, painted dark inside and out, sometimes with a horizontal reserved band around the outside. The third group is the well known Close Style, which is generally better finished than the first two classes, and is decorated in an elaborate and minute style, often with highly stylized birds or octopods. 1 See Dr. Goetze's notes, p. 288, where he assigns this Hittite land deed to the fourteenth or thir- teenth century. 2 The drawing is actual size, the photograph enlarged. 3A.

Most of the simple style sherds of Tarsus are from bowls, either deep and bell-shaped, with lifted horizontal handles, like Wace, B.S.A. XXV, P1. 11, f, g, or shallower and with a concave rim and ribbon handles, like loc. cit., Fig. 9c and P1. 11, k. There are a few fragments from jugs or amphoriskoi, but no certain pieces from false-necked jars or stemmed kylikes. The decoration of these simple style sherds is rudimentary. Some are decorated with horizontal bands only; others have wavy lines, zig-zags, spirals, or a design which derives from the early octopus, composed of two affronted loops. The shapes of the Close Style pieces (Fig. 42) are not always ascertainable. One, painted dark on the inside and with the protome of a bird on the outside, is from a bell-shaped bowl. Two sherds with parallel vertical wavy lines, a dot line, and stacked semicircles are from a closed pot, possibly but not necessarily a false-necked jar. Two others, with netted triangles, stacked chevrons, and probably birds, are from undetermined shapes. The relative date of the Tarsus pottery is indicated by the absence of the second group and the scarcity of the third. In Mycenae these two groups did not become common so soon as the first, and had their greatest popularity in the period of reoccupation. The style of the Tarsus sherds is identical with that of the Granary Style pots from Mycenae, and the shapes are the same. In Mycenae as in Tarsus, the bowl was the predominant shape; the jug and amphoriskos were less common, and the false-necked jar,' and stemmed kylix, of which we have no sure examples, were rare. The similarity of style and shapes of the pottery of Tarsus and Mycenae suggests the possibility of complete identity. With this in mind I made a careful comparison of Tarsus sherds with the pottery found in the British excavations at Mycenae and with sherds picked up on the surface at Tiryns. Over eighty per cent of the Granary Style sherds of Tarsus were made of the same clay as those of Mycenae and Tiryns, and they were fashioned and baked in the same way. This complete correspondence of technique, shapes, and decoration imposes the conclusion that all were made in the same workshops. The pottery found in Tarsus must have been imported from the Argolid.2 This find of Granary Style pottery is particularly significant, because, in spite of extended investiga- tions, no earlier Mycenaean pottery has been found at Tarsus. The Granary Style itself does not seem to have borne fruit in a derivative geometric style, as it did in so many places. It appeared full grown in the first squatters' levels over the ruins of the large Bronze Age House, stayed a few years, and then disappeared again as suddenly as it had come." At the level 16.60 m. the Mycenaean pottery was no longer represented, and with a few exceptions the sherds were all of the pure "drab" variety, with a small admix- ture of the slipped and burnished. This is the level of the large house and represents, like the three-meter level of Section A, the earlier period in which this ware was in use. This house developed some truly astonishing features which centered around the area to the north of Room II. Of this we said in the last report, "As no true floor level could be found, it may be either an area completely outside the house or an inner court." It proved to be neither, but a room, the floor of which lay some 2.50 m. below that of Room II (Fig. 43). At present, it represents the northwest corner of the building. The stone shaft to the left in the illustration is a well of Roman date. The walls are preserved to a maximum height of 3.90 m. and an average height of 2.00 m. A trough, continuous except for two subdivisions towards the south, runs from the north wall for a distance of some 7.50 m. and then turns and abuts against the west wall. Inside the troughs the west wall consists of crude brick sixty centimeters wide which rest on a stone socle for most, but not all, of its 1 Mr. Daniel writes only of Section B. There was at least one example from Section A. One remembers with interest the legend that Tarsus was founded by Argives: Strabo, XIV, 673T.</page><page sequence="23">284 HETTY GOLDMAN length. It is backed by a stone wall 2.00 m. high and 1.10 m. wide. The height of this stone wall probably represents the ground level to the west and that of the upper floor of the building. The west wall has two recesses, some 0.75 m. above the floor and a series of holes filled with carbonized matter, running the length of the wall suggest that a shelf resting on light poles may have protruded at this point. The space between the west wall and the troughs is 1.30 m. at the widest point, for the distance between the two is not evenly maintained, owing to the fact FIG. 43.-RooM WITH TROUGHS IN LARGE BUILDING OF SECTION B that the brick wall does not form a true right angle with the troughs. Their height averages 0.90 m. above the floor. What was their use? The most probable explanation is that they served as mangers for the feeding of animals. They are too high above the ground for sheep or probably even goats, and the space between them and the east wall, some 2.20 m., seems too narrow for the move- ment of horses. An animal the size of a donkey could best be accommodated. But, again, we must ask, how did they enter the cellar? A ramp may have led down from the east. Further excavation may solve the problem. A definite conclusion is at present impossible. In the debris which filled the southern end of the room, the charred top of a wooden post (d. 0.&amp;i m.), pierced with a hole (d. 0.04 m.) was found: surely the remains of a hitching post. In this same region, where the intense heat of the fire which destroyed the house had turned the fallen brick to a substance as hard as cement, lay a beautiful bronze sickle (Fig. 44, p. 282), in a</page><page sequence="24">FIG. 45. - TERRACOTTA FIGU- RINE; CARICATURE OF VICTOR WITH PALM FIG. 46.- TERRACOTTA FIGURINE OF ELDERLY MAN FIG. 47. - TERRACOTTA FIGURINE, TYCHE FIG. 48.-TEIRRACOTTA FIGURINE, YOUTH- FUL MALE FIGURE</page><page sequence="25">986 HETTY GOLDMAN perfect state of preservation. It is exactly paralleled by one found at Ras Shamra.1 Bits of straw and grass-seeds still adhered to the blade, and the intensity of the heat at this point was doubtless generated by the conflagration of the hay which was used as fodder. At Ras Shamra, the house of the bronze sickle is said to be anterior to Mycenaean tombs of the end of the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries and pos- terior to a mass burial ("charnier") of the period, sixteenth to fifteenth century. This places it in the fourteenth century. If, as I believe, the level above our house is dated by the Pudu-hepa seal to the thirteenth century, the fourteenth is the in- herently probable date for what lay directly below it. Much still remains doubtful about the house. The depth beneath the soil at which it lies (over seven meters for the upper rooms and over nine for the lower) makes progress slow. In closing, a few miscellaneous and unstratified finds may be mentioned. In an Islamic cistern lay embedded a marble inscription erected by a guild of porters in honor of a son of Septimius Severus.2 Unfortunately, the name of the son is missing. To our interesting series of caricature figurines, that of a victor carrying a palm has been added (Fig. 45), and to the realistic ones the bald-headed old man of Fig. 46. The better part of a blue-green cup with foliate design belongs to the vitreous glaze of Hellenistic-Roman date (not illustrated). From among the broken terracotta fragments found last year in the so-called "Roman fill," Miss Anderson's patience and ingenuity restored for us the Tyche of Fig. 47 and the splendid male figure (Fig. 48), with its vigorously modeled torso and face reminiscent of the Hellenistic ruler, though of a somewhat more ascetic type.3 HETTY GOLDMAN INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY Princeton, N. J. 1 Syria XVI, 1935 p. 143. 2 This will be published separately. 3 Since this report was written, another fragment of this figurine has been found. It shows that the left hand grasped a club and that the hero represented must therefore be Herakles.</page></plain_text>
