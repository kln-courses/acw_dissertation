(PRESIDENT) WHEN, IN 1935, Sir Richard Terry was editing the Scottish Psalter-tunes' and was looking for information concerning the Revd. Neil Livingston, whose monumental recension of the Psalter2 he so greatly admired,3 he found the nearest surviving relative'of this divine and scholar, Anne Gilchrist, living outside Lancaster in a spacious Victorian house high above the estuary of the Lune. Its windows looked westwards to the lakeland mountains, the sea, and the countryside where as a girl she had walked, sailed and fished,r and exchanged plants with the future Regius Professor of Botany,5 and where she made the archaeological discoveries cited at her election to the Society of Antiquaries.6 At that time she was just over 70, still in the prime of her intellectual life, and with another twenty years before her. Anne Geddes Gilchrist was "a pure-blooded Scot on both sides of her family" born and brought up in North-West England. The connexion with Neil Livingston came through SThe Scottish Psalter of 1635, edited with modal harmonies by R. R. Terry, Novello, 1935- 2 Published by private subscription in 1864. 3 see A Forgotten Psalter, O.U.P., 1929. 4 The writer is indebted to Miss Gilchrist's youngest sister, Mrs. Swainson, to Miss Maud Karpeles and to Mr. Frank Howes for papers and letters referring to these early days. 5 The late Professor Sir William Wright-Smith. 6 Anne Gilchrist was admitted to the Society of Antiquaries in 1935. Two of these discoveries are described in papers read before the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society: A Medisoal Sculptured Stone presented to Grasmere Church; and A Late Anglian Cross-head and Anglo-Saxon Crucifix at Bentham, Torks. She was also a member of the Cockersand Abbey Excavation Committee. 43</page><page sequence="2">44 THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, I863-1954 her mother, Helen Thomson, and from a family album she gave Terry the portrait of the forebear from whom she inherited both the love and the knowledge of the old Psalter- tunes which laid the foundation of her unique genius. Among eleven brothers and sisters, of whom Anne was the second child and eldest daughter, painting and music flowered in a liberal Presbyterianism, and it was in a literary and musical society connected with St. George's Church at Southport that she first found opportunity for learning the business of writing and lecturing. It can be seen from the surviving papers, illustra- tions and preparatory notes that she was an admirable lecturer; that she was appreciated is evident from the regular recurrence of lectures and lecture-recitals, and from the press-reports which, in more spacious days, would give the text of a lecture in extenso, serialising it over three consecutive issues. She received a formal musical education at the Royal Academy and Trinity College, and in I886 won the Gold Medal which the City Fathers of Manchester at that time offered for competition by Academy students. Whether or no she came directly under the teaching of W. S. Rockstro, she came home with a thorough understanding of what were then believed to be the "obsolete ecclesiastical modes". It is probably not putting it too high to say that the discovery of modal tunes still surviving "in the mouth of the people" as the phrase went, predisposed the professional musical world to folk song and played a leading part in the foundation of the Folk Song Society whose Diamond Jubilee occurs this year. If it would be too much to say that in the 90's folk song was identified with modal survivals, it is certain that collectors were concerned with tunes and not with texts (which latter they freely re-wrote) and that there was a marked tendency to admire the modal, and to prefer modal examples for pub- lication in the Society's Journal. For many years after this Journal was established as a serious musical organ it was an editorial habit to identify tunes modally, and collectors may be said to have vied with one another in discovering tunes in the less common modes. Anne Gilchrist filled note-books with Psalter-tunes classified a la mode, if one may so put it, drawing upon the rare collec- tions of Este, Day and Windet, as well of those of Beza, Calvin and others who furnished forth the Protestant Church of</page><page sequence="3">THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, 1863-1954 45 Europe and Scotland. These note-books, now part of the Gilchrist Bequest at Cecil Sharp House, are not dated, and it is probable that she added to them as other collections, for instance Playford's, came within her reach through Frank Kidson, but the inference from the handwriting, and for other reasons, is that they are amongst the earliest of the note-books, and prompted by the bibliographical passages in the 'Disserta- tions' which preface Livingston's Psalter of 1635, rather than by a current fashion in the Folk Song Society. This Society she joined in 1905. She had already carried out a good deal of field-work on her own account as shown by the note-books of songs collected in North-West England and Scotland, of singing-games collected in the same terrain, and Rush-cart Morris tunes gleaned in Lancashire, largely through the correspondence-columns of the Manchester City News. Some of this material was used in the Folk Song Journal at various times and in the Folk Dance Journal many years later: it pro- vided a store upon which she drew for observations on ballad-survivals in children's games, and for correspondence, during the last years of her life, with Mr. and Mrs. Peter Opie during their compilation of The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes. In some scanty notes about these early days, she said that a chance invitation to sing at a lecture given by Frank Kidson- a popular speaker on folk song and the by-paths of musical bibliography at the turn of the century,7 deflected her from a more conventional musical career into "taking her own way" under the influence of Frank Kidson and Lucy Broadwood. With these two founder-members of the Folk Song Society, she was intimately associated for the remainder of their joint lives. The friendship with Kidson, prolonged in delicate charitableness to his niece, Ethel Kidson until her death in 1948, was one of those fruitful relationships between two people of different sex and background in which both can call upon all that is most generous in the other, and each accept what the other has to give. From Miss Gilchrist Frank Kidson freely accepted suggestions and a certain literary polish regarding his own lectures, while he was able to bring to her notice many tunes and sources of tunes which came within his ambit as collector, bibliographer and indefatigable tran- 7 see 'Frank Kidson, by some of his friends', in JEFDSS, 1948; also 'The Vitality of Melody', in PRMA, I9o8.</page><page sequence="4">46 THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, I863-1954 scriber.8 But between Miss Broadwood and Miss Gilchrist existed the close friendship that is bound by common interest and an equal but different mastery in the same skills. Through- out the long series of Folk Song Journals to which both con- tributed as annotators, and which both, together or severally edited, their differences of temperament and approach stand out:-the one, matter-of-fact, shrewdly concerned with life as it is lived, characterised by the objective precision that brought her recognition as a serious archaeologist and botanist; the other, erudite, attracted to Christian mysticism and mediaeval allegory on the one hand, and, on the other, to the magical and primitive beliefs by which the German pre- decessors of The Golden Bough enhanced folk-lore studies in the last quarter of the i9th century. Together they were har- moniously complementary; together they raised the Journal of the Folk Song Society to a thing of knowledge and value. "Erudite" is not a term fitly applicable to Miss Gilchrist, but it is certain that, like Bridget Elia 'she was tumbled early, by accident or design, into a spacious closet of good English reading, without much selection or prohibition, and browsed at will upon that fair and wholesome pasturage'. The whole passage is so apt one may quote the rest: 'Had I twenty girls they should be brought up exactly in this fashion. I know not whether their chance in wedlock might not be diminished by it, but, I can answer for it that it makes (if the worst come to the worst), most incomparable old maids'. "Incomparable", "incomparable annotator of melody" was how those who knew Miss Gilchrist described her in later life. It cannot be perceived that in "taking her own way" she followed any systematic or premeditated course; rather, it appears that she was prompted by fortuitous opportunities, a friendship, a correspondence, an invitation, happening to be in a particular place. Whatever engaged her attention was absorbed into her memory, to be drawn thence, no matter how many years later, as fresh as ever. There is a celebrated story, repeated in the Times obituary, that when Weinberger's Chestnut-tree, called 'Variations on an English folk song' (of 8 see the sections 'Tune-books' in 'The Gilchrist Bequest' by Margaret Dean-Smith, JEFDSS I955. Three of Kidson's transcriptions, Forbes's Songs and Fancies, Henry Playford's Original Scotch Tunes, and Oswald's Companion for the Flute, Vol. III, are among the Gilchrist Bequest to the National Library of Scotland, others are at Cecil Sharp House; many are filled with commentaries, correspondence and annotations.</page><page sequence="5">THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, 1863-1954 47 which no-one had heard by this name) was everywhere sung in the 1930's, she instantly recognised it as 'Tell me, Daphne' in Fitzwilliam, otherwise known as 'Go no more a-rushing'; she had used it as a lecture-illustration in 1899. Practically all her field-collecting and lecturing seems to have taken place between the mid-go's and about I9Io. In addition to the games, songs and morris-tunes already men- tioned, she -collected Pace-egging rhymes in Lancashire, Sword-dance tunes from Yorkshire, Chanties and Sailors' songs from a retired salt (who made "quite neat" substitutions in lines he judged unsuited to a lady's ear) and a variety of songs, games and street-cries from London, the home-counties and East Sussex, where she used to stay with a brother who was Presbyterian minister in the village of Blackham, on the Kent border. Such collecting was not, like that of many of her fellow- workers, to the end of publishing or of reviving folk song. Rather, it was an interest in tunes for their own sake-the building-up of a kind of genealogical knowledge of melody-- and an interest, similar, but secondary, in the texts, and in the customs, occasions and labours that engendered recognisable types of song. Out of these united interests grew the writings and the editorial skill that only became manifest after she had reached middle life, and after, so it would seem, she had turned from the field-work of song-collecting to the field-work of archaeology. In variety of type and subject nothing came amiss, but five of these, easily separable from the rest, and large enough for separate consideration, I do not propose to discuss above mention this afternoon. The value of her work on Rush-cart Morris tunes9 and Pace-egging songs'0 with their associated customs peculiar to North-West England is fully to be recog- nised only by those interested in folk-drama and the dramatic or ceremonial dance. Her work on Children's Singing-Games is international in extent and requires particular knowledge for exposition.

It may be recorded in passing, however, that this study which Miss Gilchrist was so eminently fitted to make seems to have developed in correspondence with James Lightwood (1856-I944), a friend of Frank Kidson, founder (in 191o) and editor of The Choir and author, inter alia, of Music of the Methodist Hymn-Book (i935). Between 1920 and 1937 Miss Gilchrist wrote over 30 articles for The Choir, the majority on hymn-tunes or on biographical or historical sub- jects connected with what for want of a better term may be called popular religion in 19th-century England.12 This study of evangelism with its songs and hymns was later extended to America in correspondence with the Washington bibliophile, Mr. Frank Metcalfe, and the late Dr. George Pullen Jackson.'3 Apart from articles on certain particular songs (as, 'The Bitter Withy', 'The Briery Bush', 'Deep in Love', 'Down in Yon Forest', 'The Shooting of his Dear') her most important con- tributions to the Folk Song Journal were as editor, or joint- editor of the numbers requiring knowledge of Gaelic music, song, and language, No. I6 (the Frances Tolmie collection from the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, edited by Lucy Broadwood, Anne Gilchrist and J. A. Fuller-Maitland) in 1911; Nos. 23-5 (Irish songs collected mainly in Ballyvourney, Co. Cork by A. Martin Freeman, annotated by Lucy Broadwood, Robin Flower, Anne Gilchrist and Frank Kidson) 1920-22; and Manx Songs, chiefly from the collections of Dr. James Clague and Sophia Morrison, comprising Nos. 28-30 edited and annotated by Miss Gilchrist 1924-26. Of this sustained work Miss Broadwood wrote in her preface: 'only the greatest devotion to folk song and folk-lore can make the production of (these Journals) possible. The task of choosing and analysing, of transcribing the whole of the material and of annotating it later; the additional difficulties to be sur- mounted in the case of the Manx script; the endless cor- respondence with helpers living far away, have involved an 12 see particularly the article on Richard Weaver (Choir 1927) and transcrip- tions from his Tune-Book of I86I at Cecil Sharp House. 13 'The Folk-Element in Early Revival Hymns and Tunes', JFSS 32 (1928) and 'The Gilchrist Bequest' loc. cit. above.</page><page sequence="7">THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, 1863-1954 49 amount of skill, learning . . . and energy such as none can realise who have not . . . successfully carried through gratuitous work of the same kind'. The final outcome, fully annotated, and indexed in both languages remains as a witness to Miss Gilchrist's editorial qualities. To the Journal she remained a contributor after the Folk Song Society and English Folk Dance Society amalgamated in 1931, and some of her most mature work appeared there in the succeeding years under the editorship of Mr. Frank Howes, including her examination of ancient Orkney songs'4 and of the Wedder- burns' Gude and Godlie Ballates.'5 These two studies have a bearing on each other and on the recently published Music of Scotland (in Musica Britannica). Taking first the identification of the "profane" songs which were parodied in the Godlie Ballates, correspondence with Miss Gilchrist from the Revd. Millar Patrick, now in the National Library of Scotland, suggests that she was the first to attempt identifying the tunes, and while, in her article she disclaims being the first of any,'6 she admitted that her method of following stanza-patterns was original to herself. The editors of Music of Scotland, in discussing the Gude and Godlie Ballates infer. that the secular originals were "courtly songs", but Miss Gilchrist's convincing deductions of some fifteen items suggest that the Wedderburns, like Marot, deliberately adopted popular songs whose airs were already in the ear and mouth. Two examples suffice to illustrate the method she employed: 'All my lufe, leif me not' and 'Hey now the day dallis'. The first exhibits a very distinct stanza-pattern imitated in songs of the most varied complexion from, to take extreme instances, 'Remember Adam's Fall, O thou man' to the ballad 'Sam Hall' sung in music halls "of a certain sort". In searching for an earlier song which the Wedderburns could have parodied, Miss Gilchrist found reference in The Complaynt of Scotland (1549) to 'My love is lyand seik, send him joy', and in Ancient 14 An unique copy (not in British Museum) of Ancient Orkney Melodies by Colonel David Balfour of Balfour, 1885, was acquired by another member of the Society's Editorial Board, the Revd. E. A. White, and passed to and fro between himself and Miss Gilchrist, each capping the other's annotations. Their article on the songs is in JEFDSS 1938 and I939. 15 JEFDSS 1938, 'Sacred Parodies of Secular Songs'. 16 The appendix to A. F. Mitchell's recension of the 1567 edition (Scottish Text Society, x897) contains numerous tentative attributions.</page><page sequence="8">50 THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, 1863-I954 Orkney Melodies a tune, with text 'My love's in Germany, send him hame' which tradition imputes to Colonel Thomas Traill, called "Germany Thomas", who served with Gustavus Adolphus in the early I7th century. It is a plausible argument that Traill wrote the words to an existing tune (possibly even the tune of 'My love is lyand seik') current when the Wedderburns were compiling their Ballates. There is nothing unusual in such a practice, and to the tune of 'Germany Thomas' (as it is now known) 'All my lufe leif me not' can be perfectly underlaid. In identifying the air of 'Hey now the day dallis' (one of many textual parodies on the aubade or dawn-song with its characteristic opening to the effect that 'now the day dawns' and lovers must part) with 'Hey tuttie taiti', the air Burns adapted to 'Scots wha hae' and Lady Nairne (from its bag-pipe form) to 'Land of the Leal' Miss Gilchrist adduced a chain of evidence extending from Dunbar's complaint that the air of the dawn-song was the common minstrel's almost sole stock-in-trade, to the time when the air was used as a reveille played by the town pipers in certain Scottish boroughs, from which tucket or "toot" it derived its imitative name, and to the still later use of the distinct metre, and the words 'Hey tuttie taiti' in place of the characteristic triplet refrain, in songs relating to the dawn that breaks up a drunken carouse, as 'Hey tutti taiti, Hey drucken Patie, 'Wha's fou' now?' Wedderburn's parody fits the old form of the air (as in Oswald's Caledonian Pocket Comrpanionfor the Flute c. 1750) which, following the practice of "chorus to begin", places first the strain belonging to 'Hey now the day dallis' (or to 'Hey tuttie taiti') which both Burns and Lady Nairne, ignoring the practice, placed second. This observation and application of stanza-pattern, had, like other interests, its root in a much earlier period of Miss Gilchrist's life. In 1896 at the Burns Centenary Exhibition, she saw among the autograph MSS one entitled 'Bannockburn, Bruce to his troops' (i.e. 'Scots wha hae') directed to be sung to the tune 'Lewie Gordon', which has a totally different structure from the poem now regarded as "the Scottish National Anthem." Investigation showed that Burns' pub- lisher, George Thomson, recommended this tune and several banal alterations to the stanza-pattern, saying, "Your friends</page><page sequence="9">THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, 1863-1954 51 reprobated giving it a tune so totally devoid of interest and grandeur as'Hey tuttie taiti'." Burns made the alteration, but posterity has preferred both the form and the tune of the ancient dawn-song. Miss Gilchrist had no illusions concerning the inappro- priateness of what she called the "very secular nature" and "elegant eroticism" of the songs the reformers saw fit to parody for religious use; upon songs whose words were used as "practice-verses" for psalm-tunes (lest scripture be brought into contempt) she dryly remarked "What memories of these secular texts the choir carried into the kirk on the Sabbath it is better not to enquire". Equally she inclined to the amatory and anthropomorphic interpretation, rather than the magical or romantic, of such refrains as 'Parsley, sage, rose-mary and thyme' or 'Aye and the gowans are gay'.'7 The 'good English (and Scottish) reading', the capacity for assimilation, and a remarkably retentive memory enabled Anne Gilchrist to make her interests, whether musical, literary, linguistic, archaeological or botanical contributory to the study of folk song, a subject otherwise too narrow to be self-sufficing, and one prone to be submerged in a priori theories and sentimental assumptions to which she never subscribed. In her approach from these several directions Miss Gilchrist was, in her time, unique and while never formulating the way in which she worked, still less deliberately communicating it, she has left, and illumined, a path which others may follow. In 1945 she was appointed to the Order of the British Empire 'for services to folk song', but her admission to the Society of Antiquaries, ten years previously, at which two of her supporters were J. A. Fuller-Maitland and the late Dr. W. L. Hildburgh, gave her, perhaps, the most gratification in that both music and archaeology-unusual pair in the celestial consort-were honoured together. In the last nine years of her life when failing sight, a crippling fall, the death of the sister who had lived with her for 30 years and the constraints of petrol-rationing which restricted visits from family and friends left her much alone, she found con- solation and renewed happiness in correspondence with '7 Forbes, Songs and Fancies, 1662, No. I9, 'The gowans are gay, my jo', from Straloch MS., 1627. The Orkney May Carol (op. cit.) shows a similar use, so does that very unabashed ballad 'Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight'. A comparison with Farmer's Slang and its Analogues would bear out many of her conclusions.</page><page sequence="10">52 THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, 1863-1954 Dr. Thomas Wood-the 'Dear Captain Tom' of letters which contain more personal recollection, and more revelation of her personality than any of her published writings. In these years, also, relinquishing the formality that knew her as "Miss Gilchrist" nearly all her life, she enjoined and enjoyed the title of "Aunt Anne" among the like-minded younger friends towards whom warmth and beneficence flowed as long as life lasted. She died in the house looking towards the mountains within a few months of her 92nd birthday, in July 1954, her last contribution to the Journal she had served so long being an acknowledgment in verse (which she had always turned very neatly) to a number compiled in her honour by those who were honoured in being her "nephews and nieces".

The President added some personal reminiscences of Anne Gilchrist, whom he had known as his most valued contributor</page><page sequence="11">THE WORK OF ANNE GEDDES GILCHRIST, 1863-1954 53 to the Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society during the time he was its editor. His story of 'The Chestnut Tree' showed in a striking manner how Miss Gilchrist had tunes stored in her memory as well as the places in books where they were to be found. When King George VI was Duke of York, he was interested in a boys' camp at which a song called 'Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree' was sung, with action, as part of the camp ritual. The Czech composer Jaromir Weinberger, wishing to pay a compliment to Britain, wrote a set of variations on this "folk-song." Edwin Evans was called upon to write a pro- gramme-note for its first London performance, in December, I939. However, enquiry at Cecil Sharp House failed to locate it as an English folk-song. Hearing it over the radio, Miss Gilchrist instantly recognized it as 'Go no more a-rush- ing, maids in May.' She wrote indignantly to the President, saying where it could be found and quoted the various versions: in W. Chappell's Popular Music of the Olden Time (2 vols., 1858-59, I, i58); M. H. Mason's Nursery Rhymes and Country Songs (Ist ed. 1877, 2nd ed. I9o8-o09); the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (ed. J. A. Fuller-Maitland and W. Barclay Squire, 2 vols., 1899), No. 280, under the title, 'Tell me Daphne'; and, finally, as a hymn tune, 'Innocents', in the monthly publication, The Parish Choir, I85o.
