<plain_text><page sequence="1">'S'IO M'INTUASSI, COME TU T'INMII (PAR., Ix. 81): PATTERNS OF COLLECTIVE BEING IN DANTE Dante's is in one sense an eminently solitary view of man's journey into God. Called from beforehand to be in, through, and for him as the first and final cause of all being,' the pilgrim spirit is engaged on a journey which, for all its implications on the plane of the collective, is a matter first and foremost of private affirmation. For all his standing alongside others similarly committed to the process of properly human being and becoming, and for all his reaching out to them (and being reached out to) in a mood of charitable concern, he none the less stands alone in respect of his vocation as one called to be transhumanly (Par., I. 70), over and beyond self in respect of knowing and loving. This situ ation is everywhere discernible in the Commedia. It is discernible as far as the Inferno is concerned both in the preliminary moment of self-recognition in the dark wood-the moment in which, conscious of his dividedness on the plane of willing, the poet-pilgrim contemplates self in the inexplicability of self2-and in the moment of his justification, the moment in which, quickened by Vergil's proclamation of grace in Canto ii, he sets about the business of self-renewal with fresh courage.3 Everywhere, even with Vergil alongside him, he is impressed by the need to affirm himself from out of himself, from out of the resources of his now revitalized spirituality, and, to this extent, by the loneliness of it all, by his standing alone in respect of what matters alone. And what applies to the Inferno as a study in the isolation of the pilgrim spirit as one alert to the inalienability of the ontological project applies also to the Purgatorio and to the Paradiso as studies in self-liberation and in self-transcendence. Notwithstanding a sense in these two canticles of common vocation and shared undertaking (that, pre cisely, of being in, through, and for God as the beginning and end of properly human happiness),4 prominent even so is an emphasis on the discrete character 1 See especially the 'volontier torna a ci? che la trastulla' passage of Purg., xvi. 85-90 and the 'Ciascun confusamente un bene apprende | nel quai si queti l'animo, e disira' passage of Purg., xvii. 127?28 relative to the notion of antecedent awareness and desiring in man, the 'concreata e perpetua sete' passage of Par., 11. 19-21 relative to the kind of longing given with the act itself of existence, and the 'somma beninanza [. . .] la innamora | di s? si che poi sempre la disira' passage of Par., vu. 142?44 relative to man's prior affectivity, each in its way confirming Dante's sense of the primordial nature of the call in man to be in, through, and for God on the planes of knowing and loving. I quote throughout from the Commedia secondo I'antica vulgata edition of Giorgio Petrocchi, 4 vols (Verona: Mondadori, 1966). 2 Inf. 1. 10-12: 'Io non so ben ridir com' i' v'intrai, | tant' era pien di sonno a quel punto | che la verace via abbandonai' (after Augustine, Confessions, 1. 6. 7: 'Quid enim est quod volo dicere, domine, nisi quia nescio, unde venerim hue, in istam, dico vitam mortalem, an mortem vitalem?'). 3 Inf., 11. 136?39: 'Tu m'hai con disiderio il cor disposto | si al venir con le parole tue, | ch'i' son tomato nel primo proposto. | Or va, ch'un sol volere ? d'ambedue'. On the importance of this passage for a reconstruction of Dante's grace theology generally, see Antonio C. Mastrobuono, Dante's Journey of Sanctification (Washington: Gateway, 1990), with reference also to operative and co-operative grace as principles respectively of renewed friendship with God and of moral empowerment.

On the one hand, then, there is the Purgatorio, where, for all his breaking bread with those he meets along the way (the meaning of the term 'companion'), it is none the less the resolution of his own humanity, the restructuring of his own affective existence, that occupies the mind of the pilgrim-poet as he makes his, properly speaking, still solitary ascent. Party to a new kind of collective spirituality, he, like everyone else here abouts in the poem, is engaged in the working out of an issue as intimate as it is incommunicable. On the other hand, there is the Paradiso, where, for all his participating with the elect in a universal cry of acclamation, the integrity and intelligibility of his own act of specifically human being remains even so his leading concern. The choral and choreographic aspects of this third canticle are, to be sure, prominent throughout, and everywhere serve in their prominence to confirm the collective dimensionality of properly human being in its authen ticity; but for all that, the truth of properly human being in its authenticity is the truth of its discrete instantiation, the choral and choreographic unanimity of paradise being in this sense no more than the sum total of its parts. Blessed as it is, therefore, as a principle of strength and encouragement, the presence to self of the other-than-self in circumstances of authentic being is but an acciden tal presence in respect of what actually matters, of the quintessentially private process of properly human self-affirmation. It is a matter, less of empathy, than of sympathy, of co-celebration in respect of this or that discrete ecstasis of the spirit. Dante's, then, is a sense of the loneliness of the upward way, of the soli tary nature of the soul's journey into God. Responsive like any number of his peers and predecessors in the scholastic tradition of the high Middle Ages to a classicizing habit of mind making for an interpretation of human expe rience in terms of a consummation of the intellect, his is a sense of properly human being and becoming tending by nature to marginalize the next person, to exclude him or her from the still centre of concern. But for all its apparent inescapability, its following on more or less inevitably from a certain way of seeing and understanding human nature in its rational substance and finality, the conclusion is somehow troubling, for Dante everywhere impresses us as a poet of collectivity, as one engaged at the point, not only of discrete being and becoming, but of the emergence of the group as a whole into its proper identity. Again, this situation is everywhere discernible in his work. It is discernible in the Convivio with its commitment to an order of communal civilization alert to the destructive forces at work within the entrepreneurial idea, and it is dis cernible in the De vulgari eloquentia in its commitment to a form of vernacular eloquence answering faithfully to the circumstances of a certain set of people at a certain stage in their socio-political development. It is discernible in the Monarchia with its commitment to a programme of universal government ex cogitated from beforehand in the depths of the divine mind as an answer to tema; | che, per quanti si dice pi? li "nostro", | tanto possiede pi? di ben ciascuno, | e pi? di caritate arde in quel chiostro.'</page><page sequence="3">404 Patterns of Collective Being in Dante the forces of self-destruction in human experience, and it is discernible in the Commedia with its at once poetic and prophetic preoccupation with the kind of dysfunctionality-including the kind of specifically social dysfunctionality always and everywhere following on the alienation of self from self on the plane of fundamental willing. Throughout, the pattern is the same. Everywhere, it is a question of the ontological project-emphatically a matter of discrete being and becoming-as proposed in and through its collective outworking, its spe cifically social dimensionality, this, in Dante's mind, constituting an object of concern in its own right. But the argument needs now to be deepened, or, if not deepened, then re fined in point of cultural consciousness, for the collective dimension of Dante's meditation in the Commedia is open to development in terms of two specific ally biblical paradigms of human relationship, two ways of understanding how it is that, in the state of authentic human being (of being, that is to say, as properly responsive to its own intimate rationes), one individual may be said to stand significantly in the company of another: the Pauline paradigm of co presence, where it is a question of each bringing to the other gifts of the Spirit apt to encourage them in a joint building up of the body of Christ on earth, and the Johannine paradigm of co-immanence, where it is a question of one person's indwelling another as a principle of intimate affirmation. Neither of these paradigms excludes the other, for just as the presence of one individual to another opens up the way for their mutual indwelling on the plane of under standing and willing, so also their mutual indwelling confirms each alike in the kind of perseitas everywhere indispensable to such indwelling as a condition of its proper creativity. Both, however, enter into the Commedia in such a way as to qualify its spiritual geometry, its proposal of the ontological issue in terms of a solitary ecstasis of the spirit on the plane of the vertical; for the solitary ecstasis of the spirit on the plane of the vertical at every point presupposes within the soteriological and eschatological economy of the whole the fact of significant encounter on the plane of the horizontal, the presence of one person to another as by turns, and indeed simultaneously, an extrinsic (Pauline) and an intrinsic (Johannine) principle of affirmation. The vertical is in effect con strained to the horizontal, to an acknowledgement-in the event as rapturous as it is conscientious-of the I-Thou component always and everywhere at work in the recesses of properly Christian being and becoming. Paul's, throughout, is a preoccupation with the unity and integrity of the Christian community as the hallmark of Christ's kingdom in its historical af firmation.5 What matters to him, more exactly, is the unity and integrity of 5 Once and for all, Victor Paul Furnish, Theology and Ethics in Paul (Nashville and New York: Abingdon Press, 1968), p. 203: 'The conception of salvation as an individual matter between man and God is utterly foreign to Paul's preaching. It is true that the gospel he proclaims is a summons of individual men to God in the sense that it is the individual who stands addressed and confronted by God's word. And yet the individual does not stand apart from the whole people of God. The call to men to belong to their Lord is at the same time a call to belong to one another. Incorporation into Christ's death and resurrection does not occur apart from participation in the household of faith; baptism and the Lord's Supper are both corporate acts (e.g. Gal. 3: 27 ff.; 1 Cor. 10: 16-17). To be in Christ, in the Lord, in the Spirit means to be in the community of Christ, the Lord, and the Spirit' (emphasis original).

Exemplary in this sense is his discourse in i Corinthians I2 with its sustained development of the anthropomorphic model of the individual's being in Christ. There is, Paul says, a variety of gifts, each of which bears witness to the way in which the Spirit operates in this or that man or woman. Some, he goes on, have the gift of wise speech and able articulation while others have gifts of faith, healing, prophecy, and ecstatic utterance. But-and this is the point-none is dispensable, for 'Christ is like a single body with its many limbs and organs, which, many as they are, together make up one body' (v. i2).6 Just as there can be no question, therefore, of the ear's complaining that because it is not an eye it does not belong to the body, or of the eye's announcing that it does not need the hand, or of the head's insisting on the superfluity of the foot, so also there can be no question of this or that member of the faith community as a whole dispensing with the services of another, for all belong to Christ's body and each has a part to play: Now you are Christ's body, and each of you a limb or organ of it. Within our commu nity God has appointed, in the first place apostles, in the second place prophets, thirdly teachers; then miracle-workers, then those who have gifts of healing, or ability to help others or power to guide them, or the gift of ecstatic utterance of various kinds. Are all apostles? all prophets? all teachers? Do all work miracles? Have all gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues of ecstasy? Can all interpret them? The higher gifts are those you should aim at. And now I will show you the best way of all [. . .] (i Corinthians I 2. 27-3 I)7 This, therefore, is Paul's sense of the kindgom in its positive implementa tion. Everywhere alert to the forces of destabilization and of disencouragement threatening the embryonic Christian community both from within and from beyond itself,8 he confirms its equality to every kind of difference, its acknow 6 'Sicut enim corpus unum est, et membra habet multa, omnia autem membra corporis cum sint multa, unum tarnen corpus sunt; ita et Christus' (Vulgate). 7 'Vos autem estis corpus Christi, et membra de membro.

So shall we at last attain to the unity inherent in our faith and our knowledge of the son of God-to mature manhood, measured by nothing less than the full stature of Christ. We are no longer to be children, tossed by the waves and whirled about by every fresh gust of teaching, dupes of crafty rogues and their deceitful schemes. No, let us speak the truth in love; so we shall fully grow up into Christ. He is the head, and on him the whole body depends. Bonded and knit together by every constituent joint, the whole frame grows through the due activity of each part, and builds itself up in love. (Ephesians 4. 7-I6)9 Paul's, then, as he contemplates the outworking in human affairs of the Spirit, is a sense of that outworking in terms, not of the properties of discrete selfhood, but of the gathered community, of God's chosen people as alert in one and the same instant both to the unity and to the variety of their calling. And this, I think, enters into Dante's sense of collectivity, for his too is a sense of the infinitely varied modality of properly human being in its historical realization and of the complementarity of the parts within the whole. Acknowledgement of this in a minor key, en passant and in relation to matters of a specifically political kind, comes in the course of Paradiso viii, where, questioned as to the necessity or otherwise of civic existence (about which he is in no doubt),'0 Dante develops a discourse turning (a) on the variety in human experience of aptitude Ephesians 4. 11-16; Philippians 1. 27; 2. 1-2; Colossians 3. 15, etc. (on unity in the Christian community and on that community as the body of Christ). 9 'Unicuique autem nostrum data est gratia secundum mensuram donationis Christi [. . .] Et ipse dedit quosdam quidem Apost?los, quosdam autem Prophetas, alios vero Evangelistas, alios autem pastores, et doctores, ad consummationem sanctorum in opus ministerii, in aedificationem corporis Christi.

But important as this is for Dante- important enough for him to make an issue of it-it is, in truth, but part of a more ample preoccupation in the text with the singularity of selfhood and with the relativity of properly human happiness; for while the what or quid est of that happiness-namely the presence to self of God as the subsistent principle of all happiness-is one and the same for all men, its how or qualis est is as many and varied as those participating in it, the pleasure of seeing, understanding, and rejoicing in God as a subsistent principle being a matter of intimate disposition, of self in the precise psycho epistemic configuration of self. This at any rate is the substance of the following passage from Paradiso iII (11. 70-go) designed by way of response to the pilgrim poet's-in truth demonic-enquiry relative to status in paradise ('Ma dimmi: voi che siete qui felici, I disiderate voi piu alto loco I per piCu vedere e per piiu farvi amici?', 11. 64-66) to confirm once and for all the notion of difference in point of properly human happiness, of otherness in point of properly human well-being: 'Frate, la nostra volonta quieta virta di carita, che fa volerne sol quel ch'avemo, e d'altro non ci asseta. Se disiassimo esser piu superne, foran discordi li nostri disiri dal voler di colui che qui ne cerne; che vedrai non capere in questi giri, s'essere in carita e qui necesse, e se la sua natura ben rimiri. Anzi e formale ad esto beato esse tenersi dentro a la divina voglia, per ch'una fansi nostre voglie stesse; si che, come noi sem di soglia in soglia per questo regno, a tutto il regno piace com' a lo re che 'n suo voler ne 'nvoglia. E 'n la sua volontade e nostra pace: ell' e quel mare al qual tutto si move ci6 ch'ella cria o che natura face.' Chiaro mi fu allor come ogne dove in cielo e paradiso, etsi la grazia del sommo ben d'un modo non vi piove. No two cases, Dante has Piccarda explain, are the same; and neither can they be, for each and every soul called into communion with the truth by which it is transcended enters into that truth in a manner wholly its own, the result of which is a cry of acclamation exquisitely one in purpose and piety but variously constituted in respect of its component parts." It is the substance too of the following passages from Cantos vi and viii of the same canticle, where, in to the soldierly, ibid., 145-48: 'Ma voi torcete a la relig?one | tal che fia nato a cignersi la spada, | e fate re di tal ch'? da sermone; | onde la traccia vostra ? fuor di strada.' 11 See too, for a swift restatement of the same issue, these lines from the following canto (iv. 28-36): 'D'i Seraf?n colui che pi? s'india, | Mo?se, Samuel, e quel Giovanni | che prender vuoli, io dico, non Maria, | non hanno in altro cielo i loro scanni | che questi spirti che mo t'appariro, | n? hanno a l'esser lor pi? o meno anni; | ma tutti fanno bello il primo giro, | e differentemente han</page><page sequence="7">408 Patterns of Collective Being in Dante and through a series of images intended to confirm the reader in a sense of the infinitely precious data of selfhood, Dante explores the notions (a) of individual happiness as a matter of sweet 'commensuration' (the 'commensurar' of vi. i i 8), and (b) of collective happiness as a matter of the discrete instance as taken up in the patterned character of the whole: Ma nel commensurar d'i nostri gaggi col merto e parte di nostra letizia, perche non li vedem minor ne maggi. Quindi addolcisce la viva giustizia in noi I'affetto si, che non si puote torcer gia mai ad alcuna nequizia. Diverse voci fanno dolci note; cosi diversi scanni in nostra vita rendon dolce armonia tra queste rote. (Par., vi. i i8-26) E come in fiamma favilla si vede, e come in voce voce si discerne, quand' una e ferma e altra va e riede, vid' io in essa luce altre lucerne muoversi in giro piu e men correnti, al modo, credo, di lor viste interne. (Par., viii. I6-2I) The pattern is the same throughout. Everywhere persuaded of the sanctity of selfhood even its ecstasy (for never can there be any question here of sublimity as self-loss, of ecstasy as unrecognizability),'2 Dante makes his own the Pauline sense of discrete giftedness and of gracious complementarity as the hallmarks of the kingdom in its positive implementation. Sublimity on the plane of under standing persists-how could it not?-as the telos or point-towards-which of properly human endeavour, but within the economy of creation as a whole, sublimity is affirmed in and through the presence to self of the qualitatively other-than-self. Uniquely potentiated in respect of seeing, understanding, and choosing-a set of psychological processes by dint of which each man or woman dolce vita | per sentir pi? e men l'etterno spiro.' Similarly, the 'per ch'a la vista mia, quant' ella ? chiara, | la chiarit? de la fiamma pareggio' moment of Peter Damian's discourse at Par., xxi. 89-90 and the 'cosi quelle carole, differente-|mente danzando, de la sua ricchezza | mi facieno stimar, veloci e lente' of xxiv. 16-18. In each case it is a question of spiritual wealth as apportioned, as coincident with personality itself in its unique substance and profile. 12 See on this point Etienne Gilson on Bernard of Clairvaux: 'C'est donc qu'il [i.e. the term deificatio] signifie autre chose. En effet, ? d?faut de cette unit? proprement dite entre l'homme et Dieu que l'on vient de voir impossible, une certaine union du moins reste concevable, et rien n'interdit m?me d'en parler comme d'une unit?, pourvu qu'on se souvienne, en le faisant, qu'il ne s'agit plus alors que de l'union la plus intime qui soit concevable entre deux ?tres radicalement distincts l'un de l'autre. Cette union, c'est la ressemblance. Chacun sait ce que signifie ce terme, mais rien n'est plus myst?rieux que le fait qu'il d?signe. Pour un ?tre quelconque, ressembler ? un autre est ?tre ce qu'est cet autre tout en restant soi-m?me' (Saint Bernard: textes choisis et pr?sent?s par Etienne Gilson (Paris: Pion, 1949), p. ix, emphasis original). Paul Tillich, on the Protestant side (and still on Bernard), has something similar: 'In the third stage man goes over into the divinity, like a drop of wine which falls into a glass of wine. The substance remains, but the form of the individual drop is dissolved into the all-embracing divine form. One does not lose one's identity, but it becomes part of the divine reality' (A History of Christian Thought, ed. by Carl E. Braaten, (London: SCM Press, 1968), p. 174).</page><page sequence="8">JOHN TOOK 409 might be said to constitute a species in their own right3 -the individual is con firmed in the completeness and consistency of his own humanity in and through the alternative humanity of his neighbour, by way of otherness as a principle of moral and ontological sameness. But there is more, for it is a question here, not simply of co-presence (at which point the text reflects the Pauline model of collective existence), but of co-immanence (at which point it reflects the Johannine model). It is, in other words,' a question, not simply of alongsidedness as a powerful, certainly, but none the less extrinsic principle of affirmation on the plane of properly human being, but of the mutual indwelling of those who profess the faith. Fundamental here are the farewell discourses of Christ prior to his passion as recorded in the fourth gospel, discourses designed by way of a series of immanences to confirm the love-unity which binds man and God-and, in consequence of this, man and man-in an intimate continuum of concern. First, then, and everywhere energized by a sense of forthcoming catastrophe, comes the co-inherence of Father and Son, the deeds of the Son proclaiming the purposes of the Father: 'If I am not acting as my Father would, do not believe me. But if I am, accept the evidence of my deeds, even if you do not believe me, so that you may recognize and know that the Father is in me, and I in the Father [. . .] Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? I am not myself the source of the words I speak to you: it is the Father who dwells in me doing his own work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else accept the evidence of the deeds themselves' (John IO. 37-38; 14. io-i i)'4-where what matters is the Evangelist's sense of the mutual inherence of the Father and Son in point of being and truth, of their inner abiding, one in respect of the other, on the planes of understanding and willing. And this is a species of abiding apt in the degree to which he professes the name of Christ to involve man himself; for in so far as he professes the name of Christ, Christ dwells in him and makes of him one, not only with himself, but with every other man who professes the name: But it is not for these alone that I pray, but for those also who through their words put their faith in me; may they all be one: as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, so also may they be in us, that the world may believe that thou didst send me. The glory which thou gavest me I have given to them, so that they may be one as we are one; I in them and thou in me, may they be perfectly one. (John 17. 20-23)'5 Here, then, it is a question, not of complementarity, of each bringing to the 13 De vulgari eloquentia, i. 3. 1 : 'Cum igitur homo non nature instinctu, sed ratione moveatur, et ipsa ratio vel circa iudicium vel circa electionem diversificetur in singulis, adeo ut fere quilibet sua propria specie videatur gaudere' (ed. by P.

The other, in circumstances of mutual indwelling, is present to self as an intrinsic principle of new life, as that whereby the individual is confirmed, no longer from beyond, but from within self, from out of the recesses of self as host to the other-than-self. Dante's too, in the Paradiso, is a sense of the indwellingness of one person in respect of another in the state of authentic human being, but, as in the Gospel, his point of departure is theological in character-trinitarian, to be precise. Like the Evangelist, he starts out, not with the mutual indwellingness of man, but with the self-indwellingness of God, with the immanent presence one to another of Father, Son, and Spirit within the economy of the Godhead. Dante's, it is true, is, under one of its aspects, a pre-eminently processional account of divine being in its threefoldness, an account, that is to say, developed in terms of the begetting of the Son and of the breathing-forth of the Spirit by the Father; so, for example, these two passages from Canto x of the Paradiso (11. i-6 and 49 5 ), the first differing from the second only by virtue of its more recognizably Augustinian sense of the breathing-forth of the Spirit by Father and Son alike (filioque):'6 there at v. 11: 'ut sint unum, sicut et nos'). See too I John 2. 24, 27-28; 3. 24; 4. 12-16 (variations on the 'in ipso manere'motif of 2. 6); 5. 20; in Paul, Romans 8. 10?11 ('esse' or 'habitare in vobis'). Eloquent in respect of what he sees as the mystical component of these passages, A. Feuillet, Le Myst?re de l'amour divin dans la th?ologie johannique (Paris: Lecoffre, 1972), especially Chapter 3 ('La R?ciprocit? de l'alliance ou de dialogue de l'amour divin'), pp. 83-132, while open both to this and to their non-mystical component?to their sense of Christ as confirmed in his union with God in and through his works (the 'Pater autem in me manens, ipse facit opera' of 10. 37-38 and 14. 10)?Rudolf Bultmann, Theology of the New Testament, trans, by Kendrick Grobel, 2 vols (London: SCM Press, 1958), 11, 49-50: 'In the hour of Jesus' departure Philip asks him: "Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied." The answer he gets is: "Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father [. . .] Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me?" (14. 8-10). In the person of the man Jesus?and only in him?is God Himself to be met, for: "no one comes to the Father, but by me" (14. 6). In constantly varying expressions this unity of Jesus the Son with God the Father is insisted upon: "I and the Father are one" (10. 30). With a formulation from the Gnostic myth it is said: he is not alone, but the Father who sent him is with him (8. 16, 29; 16. 32). Formulations from mysticism are pressed into service to describe this unity: the mutual knowledge of Father and Son (10. 14, 38) and the mutual immanence of each in the other (10. 38; 14. iof., 20; 17. 21-23). Or, in mythological language once more, we read that the Father "loves" the Son (3. 35; 5. 20; 10. 17; 15. 9; 17. 23f., 26) and that the Son "abides in his love" (15. 10). The continuation of the answer to Philip nevertheless indicates that in none of these expressions is either mythology or mysticism really present, nor is a metaphysic in the sense of the later two-nature doctrine. This continuation is an exegesis of "I in the Father and the Father in me": "The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me is doing his works" (14. 10 tr.). In the work of Jesus, therefore, God appears, but God is not perceptible, as Philip's request implies, to the gaze of an observer. He is perceptible only to that man who has the openness to let himself be reached by the work of Jesus, the man who can "hear" his word (8. 43)' (emphasis original). Similarly, C. K.

But within the tradition generally, the mystery of the Trinity stood to be un folded in terms, not only of procession, but of perichoresis, of participation or inherence.'8 In an attempt to give greater precision to the notion of one sub stance in three persons, of one ousia in three hypostases, the idea of procession is complemented by that of permeation, by a sense of the inner abidingness of the persons of the Trinity, something of which is caught in Latin by the terms circuminsessio ('mutual indwelling' or 'in-seatedness') or circumincessio (London: Black, 1977), pp. 275-76 (on filioque as the 'double procession of the Spirit from the Father and from the Son' ). See, by contrast, Aquinas on the procession of the Spirit from the Father by way of the Son (Summa theologiae, ia. 36. 2-3) and on the procession of the Spirit from the Son (Summa contra Gentiles, iv. 24-25). Notable in relation to the Dantean filioque, Par., xxxiii. 115-20 with its sense of dual and equitable spiration ('che quinci e quindi') on the part of Father and Son alike: 'Ne la profonda e chiara sussistenza | de l'alto lume parvermi tre giri | di tre colori e d'una contenenza; | e l'un da l'altro come iri da iri | parea reflesso, e '1 terzo parea foco | che quinci e quindi igualmente si spiri.' 17 Cf., for the first three lines of the canto, Albert the Great (Summa theologiae, 1, tr. 7, q. 31, m. 3, ad 1 ) on the Father and the Son as a single spirative principle in respect of the Spirit.

I 39-4I, of the propriety in God's case of both singular and plural predication (a grammar, in effect, of trinitarianism): e credo in tre persone etterne, e queste credo una essenza si una e si trina, che soffera congiunto 'sono' ed 'este'. In both cases, procession as apt to express the notion of coming-forth gives way to possession as apt to denote a sense of self-containment and inner kinesis, a notion finding its most consummate expression in the 'O luce etterna che sola in te sidi' tercet of Paradiso, XXXIII. I24-26 with its at once circuminsessional imagery ('in te sidi') and its overall sense of rapturous self-understanding ('sola t'intendi'), self-loving ('te ami'), and self-smiling ('te [. . .] arridi'): O luce etterna che sola in te sidi, sola t'intendi, e da te intelletta e intendente te ami e arridi! But-and this now is the point-the careful and carefully perichoretic sub stance of Dante's meditation on this, the most sublime form of interpersonal being extends to inform his sense of human relations too in their authenticity; for ideally human relations too, he thinks, have about them this same quality of mutual inherence, of one person's entering into the being of another as an inwardly operative principle of affirmation. Eloquent in this sense is the follow ing passage from Paradiso Ix (11. 73-8I), in which, starting out with the notion of man's in-Godding ('inluiarsi') as a matter of co-equality, in some degree at least, to the height and depth of God's own intellection, Dante goes on to con firm the kind of 'in-youing' and 'in-meing' whereby self, in circumstances of proper homecoming, is indwelt by the other-than-self, mutual indwellingness thus emerging as the most radiant paradigm of human being in its collectivity: 'Dio vede tutto, e tuo veder s'inluia', diss' io, 'beato spirto, si che nulla voglia di se a te puot' esser fuia. Dunque la voce tua, che '1 ciel trastulla sempre col canto di quei fuochi pii che di sei ali facen la coculla, perche non satisface a' miei disii? Gia non attendere' io tua dimanda, s'io m'intuassi, come tu t'inmii'. 19 Commentaria in quatuor libros sententiarum, i. dist. 19. 1. 1. 4 cone; Itinerarium mentis in Deum, vi. 2 ult.; Aquinas on the common inherence of the hypostases, Summa contra Gentiles, iv. 1 ff. (especially 9, ult.); Summa theologiae, ia. 42. 5 ('Utrum filius sit in p?tre et e converso'), etc.</page><page sequence="12">JOHN TOOK 4I3 The argument is worth following through step by step. Understanding among the elect, Dante suggests, is by way of an entry of the created into the uncre ated intellect such that every exigency of the spirit as yearning is satisfied ('si che nulla I voglia di se a te puot' esser fuia'). With every act of intellection, the spirit as yearning is party to the hymn of the universe, at one in rejoic ing with the Seraphim and Cherubim-cognitively and affectively, that is to say-in their attendance upon God as the first and final cause of all yearning ('Dunque la voce tua, che '1 ciel trastulla I sempre col canto di quei fuochi pii che di sei ali facen la coculla'). But then, in a further inflexion of the immanen tist idea, comes the mutual compenetration of the elect themselves as, one in understanding and inclination, they enter fully and freely into the experience one of another as principles of intimate affirmation. Rather like light passing through water-a cause for curiosity earlier on in the Paradiso (II. 34-42)-one individual enters into another in such a way as to occupy the same spiritual space, the intrinsic thus superseding the extrinsic as a way of seeing and under standing human togetherness in the state of grace. Again, nothing here is at the expense of personality. Nothing diminishes the kind of particularity whereby each and every individual subsists well-nigh specifically in their own right. On the contrary, each individual lives on in the fullness of his or her proper humanity, the only difference being that now-in and through a consummate movement of love as the first and final condition of the whole experience-the other-than-self is drawn into self as a creative principle active from within, from out of the recesses of personality as disposed through grace to the most radical kind of self-transcendence. This, then, is what it means to speak with Dante of co-immanence in the state of authentic being. To speak with Dante of co-immanence in the state of authentic being is to speak of the real presence of one person to another as an immanent principle of actualization, as a power to resurrection operative from out of the depths. It is, I think, impossible to overstress the importance of this as an aspect of Dante's distinctive theological temperament. Enough has been said in the course of Dante criticism generally to confirm the urgency with which he addresses the social and political disorders of his day. But this urgency has about it a depth-dimensionality, a profoundly meditated sense of what it means for one person to stand significantly in the presence of another. Dante, in pondering the love-configurations of the New Testament, found there something to nourish his spirit, something to assist him in his conception and formulation of the 'hori zontal' substance of human experience in its positive unfolding, the presence to self of the other-than-self as party to an in some sense shared project: on the one hand, the Pauline paradigm of co-presence, and, on the other, the Johannine paradigm of co-immanence, each of which-refashioned in his own image and in keeping with the prophetic purposes of his own undertaking-provides him with the means of spelling out afresh the contents of the new commandment.
