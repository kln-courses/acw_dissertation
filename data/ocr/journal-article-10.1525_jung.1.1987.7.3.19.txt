GardenCity, Anchor Press Doubleday, 19 5. Paperback Edition: New York, Vintage, 1986. r Reviewed by Kirk Thompson r This partly popular and partly scientific book has recently appeared inpaperback. It contains innovative ideas, but they are presented with an awkwardness and grandiosity which have earned mixed reviews. From the r standpoint of analytical psychology, however, this effort deserves a fullmeasure of consideration. r Jonathan Winson is a neuroscientist who seeks the organic processes of thebrain which correspond to the functions of the unconscious as Freud conceived I it, particularly in The Interpretation of Dreams. He claims to have discovered what he was seeking: ill believe that the phylogenetically ancient mechanisms r involving REM sleep, in which memories, associations, and strategies are formedand handled by the brain • • • in the prefrontal cortex and associated structures, are in fact the Freudian unconscious." (p. 209, italics omitted) r But as can happen to explorers, he seems to have reached a differentdestination than the intended one. As his work proceeds, his conception of the unconscious differs more and more from Freud's. His evidence does not support r the notion of a dream censor, nor of a difference between the "latent" and the"manifest" dream. The evidence also runs against infantile sexuality as Freud conceived it. At a more speculative level, Winson's hypotheses about. the unconscious accord with Jung's theory of complexes and even of the Self. As I r read them, these ideas bear much more kinship to analytical psychology than topsychoanalysis. 'If Winson has indeed arrived at (or near) the biology Jf the unconscious, then it seems to be the Jungian conception of the unconscious r which evolutionary biology and neuroscience suppport. I Biology and PsychGlogy r The idea of a biology of the unconscious might strike some Jungian readersas unnecessary or confused. Rarely since Freud abandoned his "Project for a Scientific Psychology" has the idea been reconsidered by depth psychologists. r- Initially Freud, as a neuroanatomist, assumed that function and form would be I'IiI clear1y related. But he found his "Project" premature and chose instead to construct theoretical models of psychic functions alone, without reference to r neurophysiology. His models were metaphorical, spatial, and anthropomorphic,rather than neurophysiological. In his original topographic model, the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious systems were conceived as geological r or archaeological strata, with repression restraining unacceptable impulses andwishes below the surface of consciousness. In the later structural model, ananthropomorphi zed ego, caught between erupt; ve id and overbeari ng superego, The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 </page> <page sequence="2"> - 20 - Thompson ,- - - , anxiously scanned the horizon of reality. Analtyical psychologists employ the same kind of discourse when they talk about the persona facing the world, the four functions of consciousness residing upon two axes, and the animus or anima "doi ng" somethi ng. But most Jungi an psychotherapi sts do not expect to open skulls and find the functional quadrants ruled off, nor the complexes talking to one another. Thei r mode of di scourse does not ordi nari ly imp ly that the functions and processes have physiological "incarnations." 1 From the depth-psychological perspective, then, statements about lithe unconscious" are statements of psychic function, with no implications about neurophysiological process or neuroanatomical location. And from the Jungian 1 perspective, an organic location for the unconscious seems even less necessary because the psyche has no limitation to individual biological persons, and is finally collective or transpersonal. (I recall James Hillman saying that 1 whenever we become confused about this, we might chant to ourselves the mantra: "I am in Psyche; Psyche is not in me.") , Yet a biologist can justifiably view the matter differently, and so do many psychologists. Clinical and experimental neuropsychologists have illuminated specific mind-body connections both by studying brain damage and by , performing experiments. Physiological and experimental psychologists study ) dreaming, memory, even syrnbol-formation--the stuff of depth psychology. They approach these subjects from different but legitimate perspectives. Since biology and depth psychology are not closed systems, there are bound to be areas of overlapping concern; and an inquiring psychologist cannot dismiss the other vantage points. From the Hippocampus to the Unconscious 1 Winson's basic argument is that ., II certain recent neuroscientific findings provide a link between brain and psyche--a link that begins with an evolutionary change in the brains of mammals that occurred some 140 million years ago. This change was reta i ned in the bra ins of succeed i ng mamma1s up to and including man and, in the brain of man, constitutes the physical basis of Freud's unconscious. This biological understanding leads to , a new conception of the unconscious as well as of repression and the meaning of dreams. (p. 5) His major hypothesis is that physiological activity observable in the l hippocampus corresponds to the symbolic activity of the unconscious. The hippocampus is perhaps better known for its role in constructing emotions, but , it is also active in converting recent experience into long-term memory. It is active in both waking and sleeping states, and it shunts signals to different parts of the cortex and limbic system for processing into memory. Winson has studied this process in the laboratory ,and calls it "neuronal gating." During REM sleep and dreaming, the hippocampus shunts information about recent experi ence into contact wi th the oldest symbol i c patterns of the persona1 unconsci ous. What Freud ca11 ed "the day I s res idue" is replayed duri ng sleep and is integrated with older psychic contents. These were encoded during the "critical period" of childhood, the period of early symbolic experience and of rapid growth of the brain. Evolution required the development of this sort of process, which is like "off-line processing" in a computer, because if all The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 , I </page> <page sequence="3"> r - - - Brain and Psyche - 21 - r integration of experience and memory had to occur in the "rea l time" of the r waking state, then we would have to have cortexes of impossible proportions.Brain evolution provided for mammalian learning and human memory within a modest cortical apparatus by initiating "off-line processing" in sleep states, r carrying out the deepest levels of integration when the brain's circuitry isnot occupi ed wi th current sensory experi ence. When the bra i nwaves of lower mammals exhibit "theta rhythm" and when animals and humans engage in REM sleep, r there is evidence that this integration of recent experience with the symbolicsubstrate is in progress. In humans, dreams are a "window" into theunconscious, through which we bear witness to this integration of new experience with primary process symbolism. (p. 209) r The Hippocampus: r Winson's area of neuroscientific expertise is the hippocampus, the twoseahorse-shaped components of the so-called limbic system of nervous connections. The hippocampus has long been identified with the expression of emotion. But it is also well-known for its role in the formation of long-term r memory, particularly because of the plight of William Scoville's famouspatient, H. M. To relieve H. M. 's serious epileptic seizures, Scoville, a 1950s lobotomist, performed a bilateral medial temporal lobe resection. r Medical experience indicated that seizures decreased and little functionaldamage fo 11 owed from remova1 of one amygda1a and hippocampus, so Scovi 11 e reasoned that bilateral removal would be better. Since the operation in 1953, r however, H. M. has experienced severe anterograde amnesia: he has lived in aneternal present, unable to transfer declarative information from short-term tolong-term memory. From this neat but appalling experiment, we know the amygdala and hippocampus play an important role in forming memory. (See r Winson, pp. 10-17; and B. Kolb and I. Whishaw, Fundamentals of HumanNeuropsychology. 2nd ed. New York, Freeman, 1980, pp. 481-485.) r What is the particular function of the hippocampus with regard to memory? "- The hippocampus is that central structure in the limbic system that is closely associated with memory. Our best understanding of its function is that it makes possible the registration in the brain of an event by drawing together all of the various sensory inputs that constitute the experience•••• (p. 207) r It receives from the cortex the most highly-processed sensory data, the kind we can recognize as an event. It transmits such signals back to the cortex or on r to the limbic system. liThe hippocampus is the gateway from the neocortex tothe rest of the limbic system." (p. 30) As suggested by Papez, the limbic system is essential to emotional expression. It intercedes between sensory r input and motor output, contri but i ng the affect i ve element to mot i vat i on andaction. Overall, then, the hippocampus participates in linking sensoryinformation, memory, and emotion. This can be translated freely into Jungian terms. The hippocampus is the 1inking agency in "feel ing-toned ideas. II The cortex provides the sensory experience and the limbic system contributes the affective element to images, sYmbols, and complexes. The hippocampus is the connecting link between sensory experience and affect in the process of symbol-formation, and it conveys these sYmbols to long-term memory. In this sense, it creates and maintains feeling- The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 </page> <page sequence="4"> ,. - 22 - Thompson - - - I , toned ideas. Sleep and Dream: 1 The symbols of the unconscious are envisioned in dream, and Winson calls REM sleep and dreaming a "window" into the unconscious. Sleep research has , established that dreaming occurs primarily during REM (rapid-eye-movement) sleep. There have been a number of explanations of the biological function of REM sleep CR. M. Jones. The New Psychology of Dreaming. Harmondsworth, , England, Penguin, 1978, pp. 24-31). But Winson (PP. 51-53, 210-212) is impressed by Howard Roffwarg' s new experiments whi ch indi cate that dreams contain a systematic reprocessing of what Freud called the day's residue , (actually several days' residue). Winson concludes from this research that REM sleep and dreaming are a mode of information processing: "Sleep, at least its REM stage in whi ch there is dreami ng, apparent1y is used by the bra in for a unique type of information processing reflected by the dream." (p. 50) What kind of information processing? Winson approaches this question ingeniously by considering the one mammal, the echidna, which does not indulge , in REM sleep. The echidna is a small spiny anteater which looks like a hedgehog and is native to Australia (it may be met in the nocturnal animal house of all the best zoos). By comparing the echidna with other species, Wi nson can determi ne the function of REM sleep and dream; ng as a poi nt of comparative anatomy and physiology: REM sleep is what the other mammals do, but the echidna either does not do, or does differently. , On the evolutionary path from the reptile to the marsupial and placental mammals nature produced a genus called the monotreme, which hatched its young from eggs but was otherwise, and technically, a mammal. Two monotremes , survive, the duck-billed platypus and the echidna. The monotremes evolved from the· reptiles about 180 million years ago, and Winson thinks they indicate the evolutionary alternatives which were then available. The echidna has an enormous prefrontal cortex, in comparison to other ,mammals; its brain does not generate theta rhythm; and it never enters REM sleep. The proportionally large cortex would seem to be the option that evolution , rejected in working out the design for later mammals. The prefrontal cortex is generally thought to be "the executive of the brain," and its function is that of "forming strategies of behavior to achieve a given purpose or goal." (pp. , 58-59) In both animals and humankind, a cortex in working order is necessary to formulate strategies of behavior and to plan for the future. Experiments with dogs and natural lesions in humans indicate that without it, the organism is apathetic, the envi ronment is not scanned in order to form appropri ate , responses, and behavior is restless, impulsive, and unplanned. I We now have two important pieces of the jigsaw puzzle which Winson will , put together to explain the biology of the unconscious. The echidna does not engage in REM sleep, as other mammals do. And proportionally, it has a much larger prefrontal cortex. But certainly other mammals are not deficient in cortical functions; they simply get the work done more efficiently, with ,a J smaller organ. The question then becomes: is REM sleep--the other major difference between the echidna and other mammals--the information-processing mechanism that gets the work done without a large cortex? It is this premise , about REM sleep and dreaming, drawn from comparative neurophysiology, on which The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 , </page> <page sequence="5"> r - - - Brain and Psyche - 23 - r Winson's central hypothesis is based. But before explaining it, he has to r supply us with more data about activity of the unconscious.Critical Period: r The oldest patterns of symbolism within the psyche are from a Jungianstandpoint the archetypes of the collective unconscious. Winson vehemently rejects this concept, because he cannot accept what he thinks are the r Lamarckian implications of an archetypal inheritance. (pp. 145-146) He is, therefore trying to shed light only on what analytical psychology calls the L personal unconscious. In the formation of the personal unconscious, there is a r "critical period" in childhood, during which children encode the fundamentalschemata of perception and cognition. These early encodings are not readilysubject to revision. This explains why primary process thinking and fundamentally infantile complexes haunt the world of dream, and why they remain r forever available to be acted out in times of stress, regression, andpsychosis. r The most extensive evidence about critical developmental periods comesfrom experiments with kittens; but Winson believes it can be extrapolated to other mammals and children, to establish the general point that "the critical period coincides with the time period during which the neocortex develops r anatomically," and that "••• after a time, certain ••• strategies forbehavior are not reversible or easily modified--presumably the critical period for connect ivi ty in the prefronta1 cortex has passed, and the strategy for r behavior is largely set." (pp. 162, 208-209) Direct evidence about children suggests that humans are genetically r programmed for "categorical perception," especially for phonemes, which are thebuilding-blocks of language. (pp. 163-168) What is predetermined is not thecategori es or percepts themselves, but the predi spos it i on to organi ze some categories and percepts during the critical period of neural growth. Two- and r three-month-old infants can differentiate some phonemes, which did not correspond to the language in the environment but appeared to r be uni versa1. Thi s suggested the exi stence of an inborn perceptua1mechanism, "ready to be modified so as to perceive optimally the particular phonemes heard by a child during the first few years of r life. (p. 167)From thi s and other evidence, Wi nson conc1udes that deve1opment of the prefronta1 cortex exp1a ins "the profound i nfl uence of early experi ence on the r formation of the unconscious." (p. 179) The basic structure of theunconscious is laid down during the period of most rapid brain growth, and learning about life--if one may speak so broad1y--is the processing of current r experience in relation to these fundamental patterns. According to Winson'shypotheses, this is what is tapped in dreams. r This notion of critical developmental periods would seem to be compatiblewith Jung's idea that the genetic program of the psyche contains archetypalstructures which will be filled in by culturally-specific symbols. Winson, however, does not make this connection, and elsewhere says that archetypes and r the collective unconscious are "mystical,t1 "fantastic," and "Lamarckian." (pp.145-146) But he has either misread Jung or has read him unimaginatively, for r The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 </page> <page sequence="6"> - 24 - Thompson - - - 1 what Jung had in mind was not necessarily a Lamarckian inheritance of ideas. Why not exact1y that kind of genetic programmi ng whi ch Wi nson descri bes in kittens and children? ,Presumably Jung would have been agreeable to a modern scientific formulation. (See also Anthony Stevens, Archetypes, New York, J Quill, 1983, pt. 1.) Hippocampal Theta Rhythm: 1 "Critical periods" explain the primacy of early experiences in memory; but ... how are these linked with current experience? Winson is excited by a ! particular clue, the appearance of "theta rhythm" in the neocortex and hippocampus of lower mammals, during both waking and sleeping states. Theta rhythm ;s an EEG pattern like alpha rhythm, only slower. (It should ,not be confused with alpha rhythm, which figured so prominently in consciousness studies, e.g., of meditation, in the 1960s.) Winson's reasoning about theta rhythm is unc1ear, and I have had to reconstruct a seri es of premi ses and , conclusions which 'are somewhat scattered in the text. The starting point is that theta rhythm is emitted by the hippocampus and neocortex in laboratory animals under two different but perhaps related circumstances: in the waking state, during specific activities peculiar to each species; and in the sleeping state, during REM sleep. , In the waking state, the activities accompanied by theta rhythm in ; different animals have a common denominator: "the behaviors during which theta rhythm was generated in the hippocampus in each species were behaviors , important for the survival of that species." (p. 184) Theta rhythm in the .J waking state thus signals activity important to the survival and adaptation of the organism. , Furthermore, when theta Irhythm is emitted during these waking-state survival activities, the hippocampus is active and is carrying out a mode of information processing. It is receiving high-level sensory information from , the entorhinal cortex and is processing this information in three kinds of neurons called lamellae, which can be thought of as three kinds of processing chips. (pp. 185-187) The lamellae provide three stages of processing, , accompanied by theta rhythm in the first and third stages. Winson puts these facts together: if theta rhythm accompanies waking survival activities, and if the hippocampus during the emission of theta rhythm is processing information, then presumably it is the information relevant to 1 survival that is being processed. Theta rhythm signals hippocampal processing of survival information. 1 We have already learned from the unfortunate patient H. M. that the hippocampus is necessary for forming long-term memory. Building upon the , previous inference, Winson concludes that theta rhythm. in the waking state. signals the processing of survival information by the hippocampus into long- l' term memory. , So far, this chain of reasoning concerns the occurrence of theta rhythm in the waking state, as part of species-specific survival activities. But Winson is also aware that theta rhythm occurs during REM sleep (and in no other stage of sleep). He assumes that the brain is parsimonious in its operation and does The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 , </page> <page sequence="7"> r Brain and Psyche - 25 - r not use theta rhythm to signify one function in a waking state and a different r one in a sleeping state. He therefore concludes that during both wakingsurvival activities and during REM sleep, theta rhythm indicates that thehippocampus is processing survival information into long-term memory. In his own words, r The same neurons in the hippocampus are performing the same process characterized by theta rhythm during ••• REM sleep, when there is r no sensory output from the outside world; it is as if certaininformation gathered during the day, information associated with survival behaviors, was being dealt with again by structures in which theta rhythm is generated: the entorhinal cortex and the r hippocampus. (pp. 190-191) It must be mentioned that when he applies this line of reasoning to r humans, Winson is scientifically premature: in contrast to alpha rhythm, thetarhythm is not well documented in humans. It is not a usual accompaniment either of REM sleep or of waking activity in humans. As a human phenomenon, it demands further research. (pp. 185-190) If we allow Winson to speculate about humans on the basis of the animal evidence, then we can anticipate the outcome. Humans report dreaming (as r distinct from hypnogogic thoughts) only during REM sleep. If the general rulesof evolutionary biology hold in this instance, then what goes on in animal REM sleep probably goes on also in human REM sleep. On this long line of r reasoning, it follows that human dreams are instances--or pictures ofinstances--of the hippocampus transforming important survival information intolong-term memory. r Neuronal Gating: Winson himself has experimented on the hippocampi of rabbits and rats to r find out just what is happening while theta rhythm is generated. He andCharles Abzug discovered "neuronal gating in the hippocampus." (ch. viii) The metaphor of a "gate" is used by computer engi neers to descri be e1ectroni c r circuitry: an open gate passes a signal, a closed one arrests it. Themetaphor has come to be used by neurophysiologists to describe brain circuitry.Winson and Abzug discovered that the hippocampus's three kinds of lamellae pass or gate signals differentially, depending upon the activity-state of the r organism. They measured hippocampal signal-transfer, or neuronal gating, infour states: attentiveness, exploration, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep. There were two different kinds of output, directed to different limbic r structures, depending on the activity-state; and the survival-activity states(attent i ve and exp1oratory) were attended by the same ki nd of output as REM sleep. (pp. 196-201) r The process of neuronal gating in the hippocampus is the final destinationin Winson's search for the incarnate unconscious. All that is needed is an extrapolation to humankind. In lower mammals, neuronal gating is the r observable and measurable control connection of the cortical-hippocampal-limbiccircuit which processes survival information and establishes long-term memory. It is also the core connection between waking survival activity and REM sleep. r If humans are like mammals in this respect, then Winson can hypothesize thatthis is the biological process which accompanies dreaming: The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 r </page> <page sequence="8"> - 26 - Thompson ,- - - ] I would hypothesize that ••• hippocampal circuitry is modified during certain activity states ••• so that a specific information processing is performed 1•••• ••• This change of information processing ••• underlies ••• , dreaming ••• and ••• constitutes the neural substrate for a brain mechanism evolved early in the history of mammals, a mechanism that constitutes what Freud saw as the unconscious. (pp. 201-202) , Hypothesis Winson is now prepared to summarize his biological corroboration of the unconscious and to elucidate the function and meaning of dreams. These are the 1 subjects of a central chapter entitled "Hypothesis." (ch. ix) , He begins with the function and meaning of dreams. "In man, dreams are a window on the neural process whereby, from early childhood on, strategies for behavior are being set down, modified, or consulted." (p. 209) To understand dreams, we must turn back to the echidna, because "the key is evo1ution--the evolution of the dreaming state." (PI 204) 1 Echidna1 1 1 , 1 , , The echidna was exceptional because of its ••• huge, convoluted prefrontal cortex. And ••• it had no REM sleep•••• With the marsupials and the placentals, nature arrived at a ••• 1 solution to a basic problem of the mammalian state--how to integrate experi ence over time, that is, how to construct or mod i fy neural circuits to guide future behavior. This integrative process is learning. • • • Is learning not a process that goes 1on when an animal is awake and interacts with his environment? Perhaps in the echidna • • • this integration of new with older experience did take place during the waking state, and that is why it needed its outsized 1 cortex•••• This was apparently not a productive direction for , 1 Illustration from Winson, p. 54. The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 , </page> <page sequence="9"> r - - - Brain and Psyche - 27 - r evolution to follow•••• The new solution, which allowed the same tas k to be performed wi th much 1ess prefrontal cortex, was made r possible by REM sleep. (p. 205) Apparently the echidna and its ancestors had to do all of their r information processing in "real time," learning to survive by means ofimmediate processing in their very large cortexes. This accounts for both the large cortical size and the evolutionary dead end of the monotremes, for more r comp1i cated mammals wou1d have needed enormous cortexes. II In short, man wou1dnot have evolved." (p. 206) The evo1ut i ona ry a1ternat i ve was mammals wi th small er cortexes, ab1e to r process information into long-term memory more efficiently: The scheme that nature hit upon ••• was, in computer terms, off- r line processing•••• The task of associating recent events to pastmemories and evolving a neural substrate to guide future behavior was accomp1i shed when the ani ma1 was as1eep. A small prefrontal cortex r was suffi ci ent. • The new stage of sleep, REM sleep, was thecrucial element. • •• (pp. 206-207) Off-line processing is simply the delay of information processing from r current or "rea1" time to a time when the computer ci rcui try is not so busy,which is like the situation in the brain when, during sleep, we receive no new sensory information. In the lower mammals, theta rhythm marks the "off-line" r processing of sensory information during REM sleep. In humankind, theta rhythmhas not been established as the accompaniment of any specific brain activity,but REM sleep presumably serves the same function of off-line processing. REM sleep and dreaming are windows on the reprocessing phenomenon, which consists r of integration of new experience with the old primary process symbol systemlaid down in the critical period. Hence Winson's italicized hypothesis, that Freud was looking at the symbolic representations of this biological process: r I believe that the phylogenetically ancient mechanisms involvin~ REM sleep, in which memories, associations, and strategies are forme and r handled bf the brain as a distinct category of information in therefronta cortex and associated structures, are in fact the Freudicnunconscious. p. 209, Winson s italics r We must at this point accept some ambiguity, for Winson is not certain howmuch reprocessing occurs, nor when it takes place. First, he extends the kind of material being reprocessed, from survival-related experience in lower r mammals to all of experience in humans. Lower mammals were said to bereprocessing -SUrVival experience only, on the evidence that theta rhythm occurred during both survival activities and REM sleep. The content of dreams, r however, suggests that humans are reprocessing all of their experience,cognitive and affective as well as sensory, during sleep and dreaming. SoWinson asserts (Without explanation in terms of this theory) that liThe experiences being evaluated and integrated in humans are no longer restricted r to occurrences during particular activities, ••• but now consist of allexperience." (p. 209) He even adds that "It is possible ••• that all of long-term memory is consolidated via this process." (p. 213) r Secondly, he extends the time during which unconscious processing might be r The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 </page> <page sequence="10"> - 28 - Thompson - - - J 1 occurring. In lower mammals, theta rhythm indicated processing only during REM sleep. Again, he speculates without adequate explanation: in humans, unconscious processing might go on during all of sleep, or even during all of sleeping and waking life. For example, he speaks broadly of "an unconscious J brai n mechani sm, cont i nua lly active • • • awake and as1eep, that has been inherited from our earliest mammalian ancestors." (p. 7) 1 When his claims grow this broad, the ambiguities become troublesome. But he is convinced that the biological evidence supports a narrower, stripped-down , version of his hypothesis, that "a brain system for information processing operates during sleep in man, and suggests that the hippocampal gating mechanism described in lower mammals may constitute, at least in part, its neural substrate." (pp. 213-214) 1 Winson a.nd Freud , Winson next proposes a reasonable test of his neurophysiological explanation of the Freudian unconscious: , If this system is truly what Freud observed and called the unconscious, • • • can it explain the characteristics of the unconscious that Freud identified such as the repression of dream content via dream distortion (symbolism, the need for , representability, condensation, and displacement) and the unraveling of latent dream content by means of free association? (p. 214) , In other words, he proposes that his biological evidence and hypotheses will account for the main characteristics of dreams and the unconscious as Freud described them in The Interpretation of Dreams. , Here, however, Winson's line of inquiry takes a dramatic turn. Prior to comparing his theory to Freud's he criticizes and revises Freud's ideas until they are no longer Freudian. Winson eliminates the "dream censor" and , repression in dreams, so that dreams directly symbolize the activity of the unconscious. (p. 228) This is not Freud's conception of the dream; it is Jung's. With the dream concept so radically revised, the whole drift of the book changes, to the extent that it is finally, though unadmittecly, a 1 biological explanation of the unconscious as conceived by Jung. Freud thought that repress i on had to be ~t work in dreami ng, for the wishes and desires which bubble in the 1cauldron of the unconscious are too repugnant to be allowed to reach consci ousness in thei r natural form. Hence the idea of "dream distortion" by an anthropomorphic "dream censor," a kind of , court-functionary who makes sure that the id's unruly wishes dress decently before presentation to consciousness. The dream censor represents "the conscious ego's share in dreaming," and substitutes acceptable "manifest" , contents for unacceptable "latent" ones (Interpretation of Dreams. James Strachey, trans. New York, Avon Books, 1967, p. 268). Dream interpretation therefore must work back through the manifest content to the latent. The whole psychoanalytic idea of interpreting dreams assumes that repression ,causes the manifest dream to differ from the latent one, which can be retrieved only through the power of symbolic decoding which comes with psychoanalytic expertise. , The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 1 </page> <page sequence="11"> r - - - Brain and Psyche - 29 - r As a neurosc i ent ist, Wi nson simply disagrees. No evi dence from r neurophys i 01 ogy suggests that a censor controls the gat i ng process of thehippocampus, nor that distortion or repression occurs in dreaming. The evidence suggests only that humans reprocess new experience in relation to a r basic symbolism of survival during REM sleep, and that this is what we see indreams. Dreams simply "tell things as they are in the unconscious mind (thatis, as they are registered in the functional subsystem of the brain we have discussed)." (p. 228) "••• There is no dream censor distorting dream r content to keep its meaning from conscious awareness. I see dream distortionnot as a defense but as a reflection of the normal associative process by which experience is interpreted and integrated." (p. 214) ,.. , From this standpoint, what Freud called condensation and displacement would be natural modes of symbolic expression, explicable without reference to ,.. repression. "••• Condensation does not function as a disguise but as a means ! of representing an unconscious idea." (p. 217) And what Freud called ! "representability"--the reliance of dreaming on visual sysbols--is explicable wi thout assumi ng that a censor has chosen the acceptab1e symbols. The fact r that dreams emp loy primari ly vi sua1 representati on is understandab1e because i' dreaming is, in both evolution and individual development, an "old" process, formed long before the capaci ty for 1anguage and abstract thought. Hence r visual representation is primary and verbalization only secondary in dream.(pp. 217-218) What is remarkable about Winson's reV1Slon of The Interpretation of Dreams r is its familiarity. Jung explained in the following words how his conceptionof the dream was incompatible with Freud's: r I was never able to agree wi th Freud that the dream is a "facade"behind which its meaning lies hidden--a meaning ••• withheld from consciousness. To me dreams are a part of nature, which harbors no pili intention to deceive, but expresses something as best it can•••• f Long before I met Freud I regarded the unconscious, and dreams, which are its di rect exponents, as natural processes. • • • (Memori es, Dreams, Reflections. New York, Vintage Books, 1965, pp. 161-162) Winson first claims that his own theory of dreaming derives from Calvin Hall's (p. 216); but finally he acknowledges its proper origin: "From his r c1in i ca1 experi ence, Jung deri ved a descri pt ion wh i ch corresponds to what Ipropose here: 'The dream gives a true picture of the subjective state • • • as it really is.·" (p. 228, quoting Jung's Modern Man in Search of a Soul). And r he adds the basic assumption of dream interpretation in Jungian analysis: I "Indeed, if one had access to and could analyze one's dreams every night, one cou1d fi nd a continuous seri es of thoughts on the most important aspects of one's life, free of rationalization and often startling in what they reveal r about motivation." (p. 228) His conception of the dream is, then, Jungian. r Winson and Jung r From a major change in the concept of dreams fo 11 ow changes in otherpsychoanalytic concepts, particularly repression and sexuality.

Repression does occur and "is clearly operative in keepin? , painful thoughts from consciousness," but it occurs in the "preconscious, I which is Winson's term for the functional system of cognitive processes, particularly associational searches, "probably going on constantly beneath the ., level of conscious awar,eness." (p. 233) Neurological studies by Libet (pp. 276-278) suggest that in waking life, repression might occur in the I preconscious during the split second between sensation and consciousness: the one-half-second required for sensation to become conscious l appears to provide a neuropsychological basis for repression in that there is time for other associative processes in the ., preconsci ous to analyze events, thoughts, and memori es and repress them if their content is too painful. (p. 234) Furthsrmore, we have much less to repress than Freud thought: , Freud saw the unconscious as containing the id, a cauldron of untamed passions and destructive instincts held in check by repression. In , contrast, I find the unconscious a cohesive, continually active menta1 structure whi ch takes note of 1i fe's experi ences and reacts according to its own scheme of interpretation and responses. (p. 245) This shift is again in a direction anticipated by analytical psychology, which .., sees the unconscious not as a cauldron of inadmissible desires, but as an i 1 energic system of complexes and functions which cannot all be realized at once, and must therefore unfold progressively. In particular, we do not have to repress infantile sexuality by the practice of "childhood amnesia." Winson believes that "Jung's criticism of Freud's theory of infant sexuality was cogent. " (p. 146) The evolutionary and biological evidence about critical periods .,can account sufficiently for the primacy of early memories in the unconscious. We form our bas i c primary process imagery for purposes of psycho1ogi ca1 survi va1 in the period before we have verbal and analytic $kills. These remain rooted, sometimes persistently and dysfunctionally, causing neurosis and other mental disorders. (p. 220) Among these early impressions, those of separation from the parents are likely to loom large (and most psychologists would emphasize , those of, attachment to the mother). Sexuality, also, "is a major source of I disturbing ideas," though Winson rejects the idea that early experience is sexual experience in the sense that Freud meant. There is evidence that , children's dreams rarely touch upon sexuality, and that sexuality becomes prominent in dream-life only at puberty and adolescence, at which time it is read backward into primary-process symbolism; it is thus at adolescence, not in childhood, that we dream of incestuous couplings with mother and father, , brother and sister. And the analytic situation itself tends to generate iatrogenic dreams of incestuous childhood sexuality. That is not to say that all of the frequently misconceived infantile The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 , I </page> <page sequence="13"> Ir - - - Brain and Psyche - 31 - r and childhood impressions of sex are not registered in memory•••• However, only in adolescent or adult years when sex does become a r major preoccupation, and the associative networks are called upon togovern attitudes and behavior in this area, would these early impressions surface. (pp. 231-232) r These seem to be reasonable inferences, quite compatible with analytical psychology but unacceptable to Freud. r In a more speculative vein, Winson touches upon two more Jungian conceptswhich he believes are compatible with his hypotheses: autonomous complexes, and the Self. Autonomous complexes might be part-personalitites which r developed as alternative agents of survival in the critical period: The normal mind may be constituted so as to consider, in early years, r alternate strategies of behavior, alternate personalities. However,one personality emerges as the final one. • • • In multiplepersonalities, these alternate strategies with concurrent personality r characteristics may rise to consciousness and periodically take overfrom one another. (p. 236; see also p. 244) And the whole of the unconscious might be conceived as what Winson calls "the r unconsci ous persona1i ty," and whi ch Jung ca11 ed "the Se1fll (and in hi sowncase, "Personality No. 2"). In Winson's words, r The scope of the unconscious ideas that occur in an individual'sdreams appear to be so broad-ranging--sexual orientation and desires, self-image, insecurities as well as secure areas and grandiose ideas, jealousy and love, strategies for coping with the real world--and so r interrelated in their viewpoint that I suggest they may be describedas constituting a personality: the unconscious personality of the dreamer. r I suggest then that dreams are the statements, wishes, hopes, and fears of the unconscious personality. r ••• But one feature of dreams and the unconscious personality isoutstanding: The motivations underlying and guiding behavior in many of the important areas of our 1ives are to be found there. (pp. r 228-229; Winson's italics) Overall, Winson has been ambivalent in his relationship to Jung. He has r overtly maintained that Freud's concept of the unconscious inspires the idea ofpsyche in the title of his book. He has vehemently denounced Jung for "his fanciful ideas of archetypal figures and the collective unconscious, concepts r which can hardly be taken seriously today" (p. 146) -- even though, as I havesuggested, these ideas are not really out of accord with Winson's thought aboutcritical periods. And he has argued that basically "Jung's work does not change our 1i st of the psycho1ogi ca1 phenomena as observed by Freud in any r major regard." (pp. 145-146) But Jung's work does change Freud's in importantrespects, and in all those respects it is Jung's formulation which Winson chooses and supports as more compat i b1e wi th the evo1ut i onary and r neurophysiological evidence. The dynamic unconscious is not dominated byrepressed wishes, but ;s a structured, organized system of striving, a whole r The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 </page> <page sequence="14"> - 32 - Thompson ,- - - , I personality, a Self. And it is this structure, this Self, that is nightly the bringer of dreams. This is not simply a revision of Freud. It affirms a , different depth psychology. 1 Conclusions , Winson's oplnlons about the complexes and the Self are interesting, but they are inferences at several removes from the biological evidence. His theory has an evidential base only while he discusses the unconscious as it may be functioning during REM sleep, and it is in this sphere that his conclusions 1 are most important. In addition, I will draw some secondary conclusions about the status of biological evidence in inquiry about the unconscious. , In my opinion the main conclusion to be drawn from this book is that if Winson is on the right track, then neuroscientific evidence confirms not Freud but Jung, wi th regard to the psycho logy of dreami ng. The evi dence now comes from two sides, biological as well as psychological. If REM sleep and dream 1 allow humans, like other mammals, to reprocess new experience in relation to an early-formed and basic primary process symbolism, then it is reasonable and , parsimonious to infer that the manifest dream is an image of this process. The psychological tradition which studies sleep and dreaming has not been able to sustain the ideas of censorship, distortion, or even repression in dreaming. The anthropomorphic metaphor of the dream censor and the idea of 1 dream distortion have not proved useful in explaining the psychological process of dream construction. Richard Jones rejects it in The New Psychology of , Dreaming: "In all future reconsiderations of the theory of dreaming, let us resolve to substitute the term 'transformation' whenever we encounter the terms 'disguise,' 'distortion,' or 'censorship. "' (Jones, p. 122.) Nor have , censorship and distortion proved to be necessary assumptions from the standpoint of dream interpretation (see especially C. Hall, summarized in Winson, pp. 215-216; and in Jones, pp. 90-95). And it has proved difficult to maintain that repression operates in dreams, especially repression of infantile , sexual wishes (see especially E. Schachtel, summarized in Jones, pp. 134-139). Censorshi p, di storti on, and repress i on seem to be overly elaborate concepts, unnecessary in the explanation of dreaming. , It is easy to accept the less elaborate but quite familiar idea that the biological function of dreaming is the adaptive one of integrating new experience into old symbolic patterns. The implication is that the psychology , of dreaming should explain integration and adaptation. As part of the general theory of human evolution, it should be what Jones calls "an adaptive theory of dreaming." (Jones, p. 160; see pp. 146-166) Piaget's concepts of assimilation , and accommodation, and Jung's of compensation (in contrast to censorship, . distortion, and repression) are appropriate concepts. In dreams, new experience is assimilated into the older symbols of the collective and personal , unconscious. When the symbolism of the personal unconscious reaches a disequilibrium state, then its symbols must shift to accommodate new experience. (Jones, pp. 146-166) This should be observable in clinical experi ,ence. In accord wi th the pri nci p1e of compensation, the att i tude of the unconscious--of Winson's "unconscious personality" or of Jung's Self--may take the lead in the adaptive process (Jung, Two Essays, pars. 202-217). Jung's ideas of interplay of opposites, of compensation, of progressive development, , and of individuation are familiar elements of an adaptive theory of dreaming The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 1 </page> <page sequence="15"> r - - - Brain and Psyche - 33 - which is compatible with Winson's biological approach to the dream process. Finally, what conclusions can be reached about the way biological evidence has been used here, and might be used elsewhere, in a discussion of unconscious processes? What exactly is the status of evi dence from neurosci ence, wi th r regard to depth psychology? It is comfortable to feel that Jung is l corroborated by Wi nson, but are we a1so ready to be di sconfi rmed by the findings of evolutionary biologists and neurophysiologists? r 1 I In comparison, exactly the same question has come up in the area of cognitive science or "artificial intelligence," where there is debate about the r relevance of neuroscience to the study of "mental representations." The latterare the propositions, rules, and models of cognition that can be recreated by i the computer. Cognitive science began as "cybernetics," with the assumption that the computer might reproduce the pattern of neuronal connections in the r brain. But an approach at this level was soon replaced by one. in whichfunctional, not physiological, patterns would be reproduced; and now cognitive scientists are ambivalent about, or resistant to, neuroscientific r investigation, "out of a desire to ensure the legitimacy of a separate level ofmental representation." (Howard Gardner. The Mind's New Science. New York,Basic Books, 1985, p. 40) r In parallel terms, the psychology of the unconscious is a separate levelof mental representation. Jungian psychology, like Freudian, is a functional theory (as is cognitive science). And functional theories do not, as was said r at the outset, depend upon evidence about organic processes. So when, if at all, does information about biological function become r evidence about psychological process? There is a small range of psychologicalissues for which neurophysiological evidence is decisive, but these tend to be I relatively simple matters of sensation, motor control, and automatic regulation. With regard to complex functioning in the memory system (where r Winson has been working), the neurophysiological evidence is too sketchy andtoo remote to be anywhere near decisive. A direct look at the psychological processes themselves is bound to be more informative. r Nevertheless, biological evidence can be suggestive, and it can be one of several kinds of evidence that accumulate until, with no one factor being r decisive, one can reasonably say that a psychological hypothesis or theoreticalmodel is currently preferable to its alternatives. At present, almost all r isues about higher cognitive functions and major unconscious processes will have to be addressed at this level of the less-than-certain, where biological r data is part of an accumulation of suggestive but not conclusive evidence. The issues Winson has raised are not the kind about which neuroscience can make definite pronouncements. First, the hypotheses themselves are quite speculative. Secondly, his data present themselves at a considerable distance from the phenomena of the unconscious (those were tiny electrical impulses, not r dream images, being shunted by the hippocampus). And third, his hypothesesdepend on long and occasionally fragile chains of inference. Winson is aninteresting neuroscientific theorist whose conception of dreams is compatible with Jung's; but he can address the psychology of the unconscious only Ir, speculatively and indirectly. i r The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 l </page> <page sequence="16"> - 34 - Thompson - - - , But finally, at the level where different kinds of evidence add up for iand against different hypotheses, and for or against one's own preferred theory, one simply ,cannot overlook biological evidence. My own opinion is that analytical psychology is a broad structure which must assimilate and accommodate the findings of other fields of psychology and other branches of science, and that this receptivity is precisely its strength. , , 1 1 , , , I , i , i , , , The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal Volume 7, Number 3  1987 , 1 </page> </plain_text>
