Also, behavior may produce immediate pleasure, and the performance of activities may through remote relationship-be prerequisite to life functions. Some activities carry out more than one function. A few activities are evidently not adaptations to any func- tion. They may be regarded as blind activities unless they are discovered to be adaptations. This treatise presents an ecological classification of behavior. It is concerned with discrepancies that occur in comprehension, interpretation, and ineasure- ment of activities, and serves as an index to impor- tant literature. The author is indebted to Professors V. E. Shelford, S. C. Kendeigh, and A. S. Pearse for aid in clarifying parts of this material. PRINCIPAL ECOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES Subdivisions within each categorical level under capital letters are practically equivalenit. They are to be regarded as ecological equivalents. Locomotion and anchorage have evolved in relation to more than one function. Miany treatises cited are important for their bibliographies as well as their texts. Some of these are especially valuable as general references (e.g., Pearse 1939, Warden et al. 1935-40, Shelford 1929, Allee 1931, Elton 1935). I. Nutritive behavior. It is convenient to consider water as a food when it is absorbed through diges- tive systemiis and/or wheni it is used after intake in conniectioni with release or energy from food. A. Activities that make food available in habitats (Fig. 1). 1. Migration (locomotion, Fig. 9) and habitat selection (Wetmore 1926, Lincoln 1939, Allen 1939). 2. Defense of territory (Howard 1929, Kendeigh 1941, Nice 1941). 3. Storage of food. a. Storage in physical niches as occurs for most ants; usually involves construction of niches (Wheeler 1910, Forel 1928). b. Storage in plant niches as carried out by woodpeckers; involves conistruction of niches (Jordan &amp; Kellogg 1922). c. Storage in animal niches as occurs for honey ants (Wheeler 1910). d. Taking care of commensals such as those that secrete food. For example, some species of ants keep aphids (Wheeler 1910, Forel 1928). 4. Agriculture and animal culture; practiced by humans and some species of ants (WVheeler 1910). 5. Keeping slaves that obtain food as occurs for certain species of ants (Wheeler 1910). 6. Employment of adherence mechanisms such as (1) release of odor-producing chemicals, (2) display of color and form, (3) produc- tion of light, and (4) use of trap mechanisms (Fig. 6). 7. Employment of anchorage mechanisms (Fig. 8). Through growth and differentiation, Bryozoa and most large plants obtain anchor- CONSTRUCTION OF EMPLOYMENT OF PLANT AND FOOD-STORAGE SLAVES THAT ANIMAL HUSBANDRY CHAMBERS AND SECURE FOOD STORING OF FOOD EMPLOYMENT OF ADHERENCE MECHANISMS TIMING OF ACTION TO THE TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT OR SEASON THAT FOOD IS AVAILABLE EMPLOYMENT OF ANCHORAGE MECHANISMS / \ \ \ | J / D~~~~~~EFENSE OF / \ \ \ / Z / t~~~~~~ERRTORY MIGRATION AND HABITAT SELECTION P'IG. 1.

Anchorage keeps organisms within environments in which food is available. MAost spermatophytes employ anchorage mech- anisms as part of their food contact appa- ratus. The same holds true for such parasites as Sacculina. 8. Timing activity to the nychthemeral or sea- sonal period in which food is available (Elton 1925). B. Procurement of food (Figs. 2 and 3). Procure- ment does not pertain to the act of eating. Food accepted may be organic and nonliving (saprophagy or saprophytism), or living (vitophagy), or may consist of both living and nonlivirig substance (saprovitophagy). Animals may feed upon plants (phytivorism), upon animals (carnivorism), or they may eat both plants and animals (omnivorism). Para- sitism is a form of phytivorism or carnivorism and is characterized by the slow consumption of the tissues, fluids, or food stores of living organisms. 1. Active securement of food by means of trap, separator, or excavating mechanisms. Loco- motion or anchorage is involved. In this category, organisms are self-dependent at least to some extent. Traps are constructed through dynamic activity in some instances. a. Independent procurement. (1) Capture of food. (2) Union with hosts (parasitism and com- mensalism) in those instances in which union is carried out via activity of the parasite or active commensal. Anchor- age or excavating mechanisms are in- volved, and locomotion may be involved as applies to cereariae. b. Partial dependency upon other individuals and partial reliance upon locomotion. (1) Robbery. (a) Robbing other individuals of food that they hold or possess in food stores. Jaegers, gulls, and eagles are known to rob other birds of their catch of fish (Allen 1925). Some guests of ants and termites rob their hosts of food (Donis- thorpe 1927, Emerson 1935, cf., 1938). (b) Poaching. Foraging in the terri- tories of other individuals or col- onies as occurs among birds (Nice 1941, Kendeigh 1941). (2) Sycophantism, inquilinism, or gleaning as illustrated by Remora (Borradaile 1923). This type of behavior is char- acterized by the gatLering of food that INTRASPECIFIC FOOD TRANSFER DIRECT ROBBERY (TROPHALLAXIS, etc.) FROM POSSESSORS INTERDE- DENT SLAVE MAKING SECUREMENT OF AND INTERSPECIFIC PREY (e.g., WOLVES) FOOD TRANSFER POACHING INQUILINISM INDEPENDENT CATCHING OF MOVING PREY ROBBERY COMMENSALISM- O&gt;.PARASITISM \ / ~~~~~~~(e.g. .

Some of the feeding of certain scavengers such as hyenas belongs in this category. (3) Interdependent procurement. Cooper- ative predation illustrated by wolves as they form into packs when attacking prey (Hammerton 1930). 2. Passive procurement of food. Dependency upon other individuals for food procurement. a. Intraspecific food transfer as illustrated by the acceptance of food from adults by immature altricial birds (Allen 1925, 1930). b. Parasitism and commensalism in those in- stances in which dependents are eaten by their hosts or are presented with food by their hosts; occurs for cowbirds (Allen 1925), for ants that are fed by slaves (Forel 1928), for other insects that are fed by hosts (Donisthorpe 1927, Emerson 1935, cf., 1938), and for many parasites (Chandler 1940, Pearse 1942, Hegner et al. 1938). C. Feeding. Eating. 1. Absorption, as occurs for the venus fly-trap and many parasites. Growth and consequent increase in absorptive surface is involved as for trees and Sacculina. 2. Protoplasmic engulfment. a. Immediate formation of food vacuoles; occurs for Amoeba. b. Gradual formation of food vacuoles; occurs for Paramecium. 3. Swallowing (Fig. 3). D. Making room for food. 1. Regurgitation; occurs for Hydra. 2. Defecation. 3. Regurgitation plus defecation; occurs for owls (Allen 1925). 4. Absorption of food only; occurs for ant- lions (Comstock 1930). II. Respiratory behavior, with especial regard to aquatic animals (Fig. 4). A. Activities that make oxygen available in the general habitat. 1. Migration (locomotion) upstream and habitat selection (Shelford 1937, pp. 106, 110-113). 2. Employment of anchorage mechanisms as by aquatic animals that live in rapids; for ex- ample, Parnidae (Fig. 8) (Lutz 1918, Pearse 1939, p. 317). B. Procurement of air (oxygen). 1. Breathing movements. For instance: inspira- tion and expiration by means of pumps in- cluding abdominal respiratory movements in connection with intestinal respiration of dragon-fly nymphs and tracheal respiration of bees and flies; gill movements; manipula- tion of respiratory valves by fishes; etc. (DYNAMIC DEPENDENT (PASSIVE EMPLOYMENT) (AUTOMATIC INDEPENDENT EMPLOYMENT) EMPLOYMENT) CURRENT TRAPS AVE TRAPS SNARE TRAPS BOX TRAPS GLUE TRAPS HYPODERMIC TRAPS NEMATOCYSTS) VALVE TRAPS STRAINERS (GILL RAKERS) HOOK TRAPS GLUE TRAPS SUCKING MECHANISMS g //GRASPING TRAPS\\ \ // CONSTRUCTION OF NET TRAPS R // gPOISON TRAPS--if- \ &gt; | ONSTRUCTION OF PIT TRAPS W// ELECTROCUTIONi T A\\| / / V SHOOTING OR X \ \ \ \ / CONS RUCTION OF TRAPS VGSQUIRTING M 3.ISMI T (DEVELOPMEN OF\\\\\1 I / MOUTHS OR LINB\\ \I FIG. 3.

In down; occurs for Hydrophilus, Noto- necta, Argyroneta (Borradaile 1923). b. In external reservoirs; for instance, collec- tion of air under forewings or plates by aquatic bugs and beetles (Borradaile 1923, Needham &amp; Lloyd 1928). c. In internal reservoirs such as lungs or trachea. This type of air trapping occurs for turtles, whales, and mosquito larvae. Air trapping, conveyance, and storage oc- cur for water lilies. 3. Use of extension tubes as by Ranatra, Nepa, and Eristalis. 4. Locomotion (involved in obtainment of oxy- gen, as occurs for mosquito larvae, aquatic beetles, Corixidae, Notonectidae, and Belosto- matidae) plus air trapping (Comstock 1930). 5. Construction of an air chamber for self, mate, eggs, and young as illustrated by Argyroneta (Borradaile 1923, p. 250). 6. Tapping of oxygen from plants as occurs for Donacia (Carpenter 1928, p. 56). 7. Anaerobiosis as occurs for some kinds of bacteria. 8,. Diffusion in such animals as Amoeba. 82. Diffusion assisted by oscillatory movements of the whole body or by locomotion as occurs for some Diptera larvae and certain annelids. III. Excretion. Activities associated with exeretion. IV. Protective behavior (Fig. 5). Protection from adverse influences. Adverse influences are repre- sented by predators, competitors for food or terri- tory or shelter, temperatures that are sufficiently high or low enough to be harmful, light in some instances, and concentrations of moisture that vary from the normal sufficiently to influence activity. Also, in aquatic habitats, salts, minerals, and hy- drogen and hydroxyl ions may be of such a con- centration as to be detrimental, and they may cause definite types of behavior that result in protection from detrimental conditions. Those mechanisms which can serve to protect organisms only from biotic influences are marked with an asterisk. A. Self protection. *1. Concealment. a. Quiescence on appropriate backgrounds- often as a result of complete or partial tonic immobility-in cooperation with camouflage (Warden et al. 1935-40). Erro- neously called lethisimulation when the re- sult is concealment (IV, A, 3, h). b. Camouflage. (1) Passive camouflage (by evolving pro- tective resemblance to surroundings) . Protectiveness of apparent resemblance to environment must be supported by sound evidence for each species. There is much evidence to indicate that many species of animals are protected from predators by their color and form (Cott 1940, Pearse 1939). (a) Protective color. (b) Transparency as illustrated by many plankton organisms. This category may be considered a sep- arate one: IV, A, 1, f. (e) Protective shape or form. (d) Protective stable color and stable form when they occur together MOVEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION OF MIGRATION CILIA (OF SPONGES), AIR CHAMBERS (AND HABITAT GILLS, VALVES, SELECTION) AND PUMPS EMPLOYMENT OF ANCHORAGE MECHANISMS IN RAPIDS AIRTRAPPING LOMOTION TAPPING OXYGEN FROM USE OF AIR \ / PLANTS EXTENS ION = TUIBES x ROCUREMENT OF FOOD PLUS ANAEROBIOSIS FIG. 4.

Resemblance to dung, etc. (2) Active camouflage. Passive camouflage often occurs with active camouflage, especially for category (c). (a) Through chromatophoral activity; occurs for some fishes, crustace- ans, cephalopods, chameleons, etc. (Parker 1932, Hanstrom 1940). (b) Through placement of natural ob- jects on the body as occurs for spider crabs (Pearse 1939). This is not usually intelligent behavior as at least some crabs do not need a brain to perform their camouflage activities (Minkiewicz, cf., Holmes 1911). This type of behavior is analogous to concealment brought about through excavation (IV, A, 2, b and Fig. 7). (c) Background selection; occurs for crayfishes (Brown 1939). (d) Imitation of the environment through behavior of the whole animal as occurs for larvae of geometrid moths (Jordan &amp; Kel- logg 1922; Cott 1940). c. Timing of activity and rest. Timning of community activity to the nychthemeral or seasonal period in which the majority of possible predators cannot see efficiently. Also, timing of rest and shelter procure- ment to the period when shelters are not used by competitors (Elton 1935). d. Procurement of shelters, especially those which completely conceal inhabitants; may involve construction of shelters. e. Minute size. The smallest organisms such as bacteria are not eaten by animals that depend upon sight for locating food and cannot be captured by organisms larger than protozoa and rotifers since strainers and all other traps except current traps are not fine enough to catch them. 2. Removal from adverse influences. Escape. a. Retreat. (1) Migration (locomotion) to new habitats in which an adverse influence is less pronounced or lacking and (2) movements that lead a portion of an organ- ism away from a detrimental influence. Such movements may oceur as negative re- responses to harmful stimuli (Pearse 1939, p. 138). They often occur as either posi- tive or negative responses to either harmn- less or harmful factors that are always DORMANCY ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION REPULSION BY SOUND COOPERATIVE OF SHELTER AND ACTIVE WARNING FORM AND PRODUCT ON FIGHTING OR SECRETION OF SCREENS COLOR AND MIMICRY t L CHASING ESTABL ISHMENT AUTOMATIC REPULSION BY OF NEST SIGHTS CONSTRUCTION ACTIVE RELEASE '* OF SHELTER OF OBNOXIOUS t \ / i/ .

Escape from detrimental influences may rely upon random movement or upon trial and error orientation. Response to stimuli is not always essential for escape to be accomplished. b. Obstruction of adverse influences by bar- riers. (1) Procurement of barriers to adverse in- fluences (Fig. 7). The building of city and state walls by ancient peoples and remaining in niches, especially those too small for enemies to enter, belong in this category. Active construction of shelters may be involved. (2) Direct blocking of detrimental factors. (a) Active placenment of shields as when the latter are moved so as to receive attacks; occurs for stags. (b) Exposure of defense structures to a maximum extent. This type of be- havior occurs for porcupines, some armadillos, and certain sensitive plants. (3) Blocking openings; dependent upoIn procurement of shelter. (a) Active blocking of openings as through the employment of heads as plugs; occurs for the ants of the genus Camponotus (i\Iann 1935). (b) Blocking of openings dependent upon retreat; illustrated by snails that use operculae or epiphragms. (4) Cooperative blocking. This mechanism is illustrated by animal groups when members form aggregates, each unit of which plays a part in sheltering the group from cold, wind, or predators, etc. Musk oxen employ this mechanism as protection against predators and cold (Clements &amp; Shelford 1939). The same mechanism assists in the protec- tion of bees from low temperatures. c. Retreat into or behind obstructions such as shelters. di. Timing of activity and rest. Timing of community activity to the nychthemeral or seasonal period in which the majority of possible predators are least active or to the time at which temperature, moisture, or other environmental conditions are most satisfactory (Elton 1935, Pearse 1939, Park 1939, 1940). d2. Dormancy following procurement of shel- ter (Shelford 1929, Pearse 1939, Warden et al. 1935-40, Benedict 1938). 3. Repulsion of adverse influence. *a. Release of repulsive chemicals (odors); occurs for Papilio (Comstock 1930). 'b. Exposure of warning coloration or/and form, sometimes in connection with storage of distasteful or poisonous chemicals (Pearse 1939); includes resemblance to faeces. *c. Combination of a and b; occurs for Papilio (Comstock 1930).

Consider the aggressive attitude of pus moth cater- pillars. *i. Lethisimiulation may in some instances re- sult in the indifferenlce of possible pred- ators that feed only upon living organisms (Holmes 1908, Warden et al. 1935-40). 4. Removal or destruction of adverse influence. a. As a consequence of bathing and combing (Pearse 1939, p. 323). *b. Killinig or incapacitation of intruders through the use of trap inechanisms (Fig. 3). 5. Counter action of adverse influenice. Sonie animals such as bees may counteract low temperatures by remaining hyperactive. High teniperature may be counteracted by humans through increasing rate of evaporationi as by faniiing. B. Family, commensal, and species protection. Pro- tection of offspring, potential offspring (eggs), mate, or members of a colony. 1. Concealment. a. Quiescence on an appropriate background in conjunction with camouflage while the body covers or encloses offspring or any members of an organismal unit (see IV). b. Nocturnalism when behavior of some mem- bers determines the time of activity or location of other members of an organismal unit. c. Procurement of shelters when safety of immature is effected. 2. Escape. a. Movement away from adverse influences when family members are carried within or on the body or when members follow or imitate a leader that moves into a more suitable environment. b. Category IX is often a protective mecha- nism when members of an organismal unit are carried, or when members follow or imitate a leader that inoves inito an einviroii- ment in which adverse inifluences are less effective. c.

This mechanism occurs for lace- wings and certain snails which form eggs that are situated upon long stalks. c . Remaining in niches or retreating into niches when members are carried by or at- tracted to a leader. This applies especially to instances in which shelters are too small for enemies to enter. Secretion or con- struction of shelter may be involved. d. Timing of activity to the invchthemeral or seasonal period in which the majority of possible predators are least active, or to the time at which temperature, or moisture, or other conditions are not suitable. This aspect of behavior protects family or group members when the latter are carried by or led by special individuals (Elton 1935). e. Rapid reproduction. Reproductive rate may be sufficiently high to permit a por- tion of individuals to outnumber the total number of adverse influences. This applies to all species that have not become extinct, and once held for extinct species up to the time of their extinction. This provision applies especially to those species that lack most of the other protective mechanisms; for example, most grasses, some plankton organisms, many insects, and bacteria. Reproduction is essentially a mechanism that prevents the complete destruction of protoplasm. 3. Repulsion (IV, A, 3, points a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h). 4. Removal or destruction of adverse influence (IV, A, 4, point b). 5. Distraction of enemies as by self display. a. Rapid movement; often occurs in conjunc- tion with point b for many birds. b. Sound production such as the singing of male birds. c. Simulation of injury (Tomkins 1942). 6. Counteraction of adverse influences (IV, A, 5). C. Protection of home, territory, and miscellaneous property. 1. Repulsion (IV, A, 3). 2. Removal or destruction of adverse influence (IV, A, 4). The most indirect trap mecha- nism is the propagation and release of para- sites of cirop pests. V. Cleansing behavior. A. Body cleaning movements: scratching, bathing, preening, and combing. B. Elimination of refuse from abodes. For ex- ample, elimination of feces from nests. 1. Independent elimination of refuse as occurs for young herons. 2. Dependent elimination as occurs for the im- mature of most passerine birds. Parents remove egested material for a period after the young hatch (Kendeigh 1941).

Elimination of irritation, pain, discomfort, or displeasure caused by influences not detrimental to a significant extent. Influences and adaptations may be the same as those listed for protective be- havior (IV). Positive responses to stimuli either assist in the perforinance of some life function (I-V or VI inclusive), lessen pain or discomfort (IX), give pleasure (XI), or are blind (XIII). X. Prerequisite activities. Behavior prerequisite to any life function; for example, learning a trade or working at an occupation. Humans usually carry out prerequisite activities when penalties or mo- tives such as rewards are realized. Some organisms carry out preiequisite acts by working for humans, by providing food or entertainment, or by serving as symbionts to other species. XI. Recreation and behavior that gives immediate pleasure as occurs for some birds, otters, and many primates. For example, otters repeatedly slide down banks that border bodies of water (Ham- merton 1930). XII. Complex activities. Some activities serve si- multaneously as complexes of more than one life function. Five subdivisions are given. Many more are possible. A. Protective - cleansing - organizational be ha v io r. Combing is not necessarily confined to cate- gories V, VII, or VIII. This act may si- multaneously serve an organism as a means of organization of external conditions, cleansing, and protection. B. Nutritive-protective behavior. Some migrations probably protect certain animals from adverse climatic conditions and at the same time bring about availability of food. C. An activity may be both restful and recreational. D. Nutritive-respiratory behavior. Migration in a stream may bring about satisfaction of both nutritive and respiratory requirements. E. Nutritive-protective-respiratory behavior. XIII. Blind activities. Some activities cannot be ex- plained as a function of any adaptation. Some activities do not always appear to be related to purposes or definite needs. A. Some migrations; for example, as occur for in- sects (Williams 1930). B. Some hibernations. The factor which brings about hibernation of the beetle, Cicindela hlirti- collis Say, is not yet explained (Shelford 1929, p. 154). This hibernation finallv is accompanied by winter and is then adaptive. Hibernation of this beetle is blind only up to the time that an adverse environment exists. C. Some abnormal actions (Part K). D. Some tropistic behavior; for example, as for nocturnal animals attracted to artificial lights. The adaptive functions of particular structures and their actions must be determined with consider- able care. Trichocysts are commonly regarded as a mechanism that tends to protect Paramecium from the attacks of Didinium. The following procedure demonstrates that trichocysts probably have no pro- tective value to Paramecium. The cover slip and mounting medium are removed from a micro-slide preparation of Paramecium individuals in various stages of being eaten by Didinium. A stain for ex- ploded trichocysts is added and the material re- mounted. Usually no evidence of the presence of a single expanded trichocyst appears for any of the stages of engulfment. Use of a special staining technique is ordinarily not necessary for making trichoeysts visible, but evidence is more reliable when special methods are employed. A method of fixing Paramecium in these stages is used by well-known dealers in biological supplies and rarely-if ever-causes expansion of trichocysts; so, a prepared slide affords the evidence mentioned as well as would observations of living material, pro- viding it were possible to see expanded trichocysts oIi normal living specimens.</page><page sequence="13">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 351 POSSIBLE ASPECTS AND SUBCLASSIFICATIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL ECOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES In those iinstainces in which references are not mentioned in connection with behavior traits, consult such general treatises as have been presented by Shelford (1929), Pearse (1939), Warden et al. (1936- 40), Heilbrunn (1937), and texts on taxonomic groups such as those concerned with entomology. In those instances in which hypotheses or theories have been drawn from aiiy sources, citations to authors are given. Physiological Ecology may be studied according to several standpoints. The most important of these aspects are: vital physiological activities, classes of complexity of action, responses, guiding mechanisms, orientation, adaptations, adjustment, timing of activ- ities, relative importance of endogenous and environ- mental factors that govern activities, modification of behavior, physiological functions of aggregations, and abnormal behavior. Autecology merges with both physiology and syn- ecology. Behavior may be studied according to the following standpoints (points 1 through 9 have autecological applications; synecology is covered by points 3 through 11): 1. Physiological activities (see physiological ecology above). 2. Adjustmentt in behavior. 3. Modification of behavior. 4. Timing activities: ecological causes and results. 5. Place relationship between organisms and their environment. 6. Importance of activity to survival of organismal units: community, species, colony, symbiotic or commensal unit, individual. 7. Nature of biotic food and shelter relationships. 8. Extent that organisms are exposed in communi- ties. 9. Methods employed that influence other indi- viduals. 10. Activities may affect physical or biotic environ- ments, or both. 11. Extent of influence upon environment. [1] PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES PART A. VITAL PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES Div. 1. Vital individualistic activities. I. Nutritive activities. II. Respiratory activities. III. Excretion. IV. Secretioni: secretion of protective mucus (Plan- aria); secretion of shelters (clams, octopuses), etc. (see VIII). V. Growth and differentiation; that is, embryonic and postembryonic growth and differentiation, metamorphosis-including pupal differentiation (Weiss 1939, Hanstrom 1940); regeneration (Loeb 1924). VI. Rest. Recovery from fatigue. VII. Rejuvenation. Conjugation and fission may be of immediate vital importance for some organ- isms such as certain species of infusoria. VIII. Protective activities: autonomy, regeneration, secretion of mucus and shelters, secretion of poisonous or obnoxious chemicals, fighting of disease as by development of antitoxins or antivenins, counteraction of endosmosis by em- ployment of contractile vacuoles, etc. Div. 2. Vital species activities. Besides the phys- iological activities that are of immediate vital importance to individuals, the following are im- portant for the survival of species. I. Reproduction. A. Asexual reproduction for some species. Fis- sion; or, budding followed by oviposition or birth for parthenogenetic species. B. Sexual reproduction. Budding and mating fol- lowed by oviposition or birth; or budding plus external fertilization. II. Care of embryo or immature. A. Automatic provision of nutrition to embryos or immature in some species; occurs for Peripatus, guppies, Gambusia, dog-fish sharks, mammals- especially placentals and marsupials. B. Protection of immature. Protection is pro- vided by mammals, especially placentals and marsupials, Cladocera, Peripatus, guppies, Be- lostomatidae, skates through provision of egg cases. C. Provision of oxygen to immature. Automatic physiological provision occurs for placental mammals, guppies, and Peripatus. Provision through dynamic behavior occurs for crayfishes by means of oscillation of pleopods. D. Provision of an excretory outlet for immature; occurs for placental mammals, guppies, Peri- patus, etc. Div. 3. Vital group activities. Besides the phys- iological activities covered in Division 1, several are especially important for continued existence of groups. Most activities involved in aggregations may be too complex to be considered within the scope of phys- iological ecology. On the other hand, individuals may be regarded as organs in the aggregation and all of their activities regarded as physiological. Co- operative and peck-order activities are often essen- tial to the existence of groups where a high degree of organization is required (Allee 1931, 1938). Physiological activities that are vital to the existence of aggregates especially for sessile forms include re- production. Tropistic reactions of many individuals to a common source of stimulation are sometimes responsible for the formation of groups (Allee 1931). Div. 4. Vital community activities. Communities may be regarded as super-organisms (cf., Allee 1931, p. 352, Clements &amp; Shelford 1939, p. 22). Species are equivalent to organs, and individuals are comparable to cells. Members of commu-</page><page sequence="14">352 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 nities must interact in a definite manner if superorganisms are to survive. The following activities must occur in superorganisms. I. Species procurement of food. The amount of food secured must be in small proportion to that which exists, or must be obtained through effort and expenditure of considerable time. Secure- ment of food by a species must not be overly successful (Clements &amp; Shelford 1939, p. 185), but must be sufficient to provide for an increase in reproduction at times. Kind of food accepted may change at times (Shelford 1937, p. 31) and tends to depend mostly upon what is available. IT. Provision of enemies. Communities must pro- vide at least one predator or parasite for each species (Clements &amp; Shelford 1939, p. 185), ex- cept for those species which have a low coeffi- cient of reproduction (due either to adverse physical conditions of the habitat or to low re- productive capacity) and for those species which have special difficulty in finding or obtaining food. Eagles and parasites or hyperparasites do not require enemies to check their abundance. Enemies may change from time to time (Shel- ford 1937, p. 31). III. Provision of shelter. In some communities such as tundras, hot dry deserts, and some grasslands, plants do not provide shelter to many of the larger community members, and burrows con- structed by one species serve as habitations for one or more different species. In forests, only a small proportion of species depends upon the inanimate environment for shelter, and the direct provision of shelter is an important activity of plant constituents. It is important that this activity of plants be maintained if the existence of certain types of communities is to continue. IV. Retreat. For example, nocturnal associations must retreat during the day by way of some method of concealment to prevent their being destroyed by diurnal associations (Elton 1935). Diurnal time-associations are concealed by dark- ness at night from nocturnal time-associations. Time-association is substituted here for time- community as used by Elton. PART B. CLASSES OF COMPLEXITY OF ACTION Div. 1. Extent to which control of activity is direct or indirect. Activities differ in complexity ac- cording to whether they are carried out directly through protoplasmic action or executed by re- mote control through function of a nervous sys- tem, through influence of substances carried in circulatory systems, or through functions of both nervous and hormonal mechanisms. The behavior of various chromatophores illustrates these stages of complexity (Parker 1932, Hanstr6m 1940). Div. 2. Extent to which behavior is instinctive, learned, modified by intelligence, or innovated (Parts I and J also, pp. 368-375). I. Simple instinct. Elementary instinct. A. Spontaneous protoplasmic activity. B. Direct protoplasmic response as for Amoeba and some chromatophores (Holmes 1911, Parker 1932). C. Guidance of activity by organelles; for ex- ample, function of the stigma in many flagel- lates, and neuromotor regulation of activitv in many protozoans. D. Spontaneous protoplasmic activity of tissues and organs (such as effectors) of metazoa; for instance, repeated waves of ciliary move- ments on ciliated epithelium responsible for locomotion of Planaria, activity of certain glands such as the secretion of shelter by clams, and action of special muscles such as the beating of myogenic hearts. E. Direct protoplasmic response to external stimuli in specialized cells of metazoa; neuroid and neuromuscular activity (Parker 1919). F1. Wave response; as when a wave of muscular contraction occurs on the margin of the bell of a medusa, or a wave of ciliary movement occurs on a unicellular or multicellular base. F2,. Continuous wave response; as when the com- pletion of one wave cycle stimulates the origin of a new wave stimulus; probably occurs for the beating of cilia on Vorticella. G. Response to rhythmic release of spontaneous nervous impulses that originate in ganglia (Prosser 1934); illustrated by the beating of neurogenic hearts and the movements of entomostacran phyllopods (direct observa- tion). H. Reflex action (Pavlov 1927, cf., Warden et at. 1936; 1941); activity dependent upon un- modified, spontaneous, nervous activation of effectors as results through stimulation of sensory receptors located on the organs that are finally activated. Afferent and efferent nervous paths run parallel to each other for most of their course and an original sensory impulse is reflected by an adjustor. Reflex and reflection are derived from the same Latini root. Reflex is a misnomer for deflected action. If it is preferable to retain the term reflex to cover deflected action, then two types of reflexes must be recognized according to two separate classes of complexity: (1) simple reflex or reflected action (point H), (2) de- flected action (the next point). I. Deflection. 1: Direct shunting. Shunting or abridged de- flection. In this category, a nervous impulse is switched directly from the point of stimu- lation to another part of an organism. a. Mirror shunting. An impulse is shunted to the opposite side of an organism. b. Orthometameric or axial shunting. Inter- nuncial adjustors switch nervous impulses to adjacent areas along the body axis.</page><page sequence="15">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 353 2. Central deflection or central transfer of ner- vous action; central deflection. Activity re- sults through stimulation of sensory receptors located on organs other than those that are activate(l. Afferent and efferent nervous paths do not run exactly parallel to each other. Original sensory impulses are deflected by a central adjustor, the brain. This type of mech- anism was presented by Loeb (1918) to ex- plain certain tropisms of arthropods. Loeb did not attempt to explain how tropisms may be modified in accordance with conscious localization of stimuli in mental space, desires, volition, and intelligence. The fact that specific characteristics of tropistic behavior may be inhibited or modified following tropistic ex- perience does not indicate that explanations originally presented by Loeb to account for orientation of adult arthropods should neces- sarily be incorrect. The ability of many animals to regulate behavior so as to accom- plish original tendencies after one side is injured indicates that psychological phenomena of an order higher than at first realized often occur in many organisms (Warden et al. 1940, p. 63, 781, 783). It is not unrea- sonable that one of these psychological phe- nomena that assists in controlling behavior in many lower as well as in higher organisms amounts to desire in some instances. Experi- mental evidences show that deflection mecha- nisms account at least in part for the original nature of tropistic action for the arthropods studied by Loeb (1918), that is, for the tro- pistic tendencies previous to their modification. Abridged and central deflection also account for many compensatory movements (Holmes 1911, p. 39), although some compensatory movements involved in equilibrium of higher organisms result through proprioceptive reflex action. Deflected nervous action is responsible in part for many individualistic activities, to include scratch movements and body cleaning movements when foreign substances or irrita- tions on the body provide the stimulation for movements. II. Compound instinct. A. Chronological instinctual behavior. Consec- utive occurrence of specific and different un- learned, un-innovated actions. In compound instinct, completion of one act serves as a stimulus or release of a new tendency that starts another type of specific action. To start an act serves as sufficient stimulation for executing it. Successive activities depend upon a chain of stimuli, most links of which are brought about by an animal's own activity. 1. Spontaneous centrogenative compound in- stinct. Stimuli from the external environ- ment are not involved. Native activity of whole organisms is dependent upon spon- taneous activity of a controlling nervous center that may in some instances be reg- ulated by hormones; for example, body cleaning routines as occurs for flies, cray- fish, mice, etc., and singing of birds inde- pendently of environmental stimulation. Descriptions of cleaning movements of some invertebrates have been presented by Szymanski (1918). 2. Envirogenative compound instinct. An en- vironmental stimulus starts a chain of stimuli no longer dependent upon stimuli produced by external conditions. A male canary may be prompted to sing by the presence of a female and may complete the song after the removal of the female. 3. Externally guided compound instinct. Ex- ternal stimuli and responses are involved at more than one stage of action, for ex- ample as occurs for birds during nest making. A single step of a complex instinct is equivalent to a simple instinct. The first step in execution of a fighting instinct is approach towards an enemy. A chase may ensue and end without further involvement of instinct. If an enemy does not leave when approached by an aggressor, further steps of fighting instinct tend to take place (Herrick 1905). B. Reversal of instinctive action. For example, first experiences in homing as when gradients or landmarks are present to guide activity. Carrying out reversal of instinctive action is not dependent upon previous experience of going through the process. The activity proc- ess is not learned nor innovated, so it must be classified as instinctive. Memory of fea- tures in an environment are required in some instances as for homing behavior of some higher animals. Abstract memory is not al- ways involved as illustrated by the homing behavior of chitons and limpets (Crozier 1921, cf., Warden et al. 1940; Holmes 1911, p. 187, 188). III. Learned action. Conditioned action. (Kinsey 1941.) A. Direct training. Actions are conditioned by experiences that create associations between actions or between abstractions, or between abstractions and action. The tendency for associations to occur through experience and the tendency for action to be conditioned by associations are instinctive. Conditioned ac- tions are learned. Conditioned deflected action. Activity is dependent upon conditioned nervous associa- tions that are not immediately modifiable. (Conditioned deflection is usually known as conditioned reflex action. Reflexes are nor-</page><page sequence="16">354 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 mally executed by instinct and do not lend themselves to conditioning.) Habits are action or thought chains that are created by associative experience. Links in chains may be composed of actions, thoughts followed by specific actions, actions followed by specific thoughts, or may occur between thoughts only. Some mental habits are coincident with, some precede, some fol- low, and others are independent of bodily activity. Habits that have a primitive physiological basis do not differ essentially from conditioned deflected action mechanisms. Habits that de- pend upon conscious centers differ from con- ditioned deflected actions, since habits that depend upon conscious centers are immedi- ately modifiable at least in humans. B. Transfer of training (may belong under IV, cf., psychol. texts). IV. Intelligent action. Activity may be modified in- telligently through learning, or through reason- ing and forethought (innovation, point V). Learning may occur by trial and error, by what is directly observed, or by way of ideas received through communication. Points of advantage gained through learning are: (1) characteristics of efficient action, (2) method of action, (3) what acts lead to success or a goal regarded by individuals as desirable, (4) what acts lead to pain and what ones lead to agreeableness. Activ- ity may be modified intelligently as follows: A. Modification through guidance of activity of organs (e.g., as organs of locomotion) in ac- cordance with whether objects or acts sym- bolize pain or satisfaction, that is, according to conditioned mental state. B. Modification through increased efficiency in action as is attained by reduction of inter- mediate and unnecessary movements (or thoughts) originally involved in complex activities; that is, by elimination of random movements. C. Modification through guidance of a nerve cen- ter so as to carry out an original tendency or a desire when one method or mechanism is blocked by injury or removal. Such an in- stance of modification occurs for robber flies in their reaction to light after one eye is painted (Loeb 1918). Refer to modifiability of activity in Part J, p. 370. Ability to modify behavior is not evidence that an original, nat- ural reaction to a stimulus is not instinctive. D. Modification through invention (point V be- low). Behavior may be modified intelligently by addition of new features or elimination of certain aspects originally involved. V. Innovation. Creative activity. Originality in Action (Morgan 1933). A. Originality involved in choice of action. Orig- inality may be involved when choice must be made between actions, all of which symbolize pain, or all of which symbolize satisfaction. Choice of activities followed by human beings is determined by relative importance of de- sires. Most human desires are based upon relative importance of the following (point 1 illustrates primitive desires). The following are usually purely instinctive or absent in most species. 1. Physiological desires: tendencies to eat, sleep, etc. Selection of food, mate, habitat, time of rest are in part guided by original- ity and individual differences in taste. 2. Selfishness, desires to be happy, to acquire wealth, to have social approval, to dominate others, to be praised. 3. Desire to satisfy emotions built upon wish- ful thinking. 4. Desire to do or repeat creative work that appeals to aesthetic sense. Activities that give rise to art, music, poetry, etc. 5. Desire to help others to relieve suffering or to increase happiness. 6. Desire to discover and know what is true and to guide one's activities in accordance with facts, a basis for invention and re- search. 7. Desire for high quality of action or product of action. Points 4, 5, 6, and 7 are peaks in the evolution of behavior. B. Development of new methods by substitution of new acts that modify or tend to satisfy natural tendencies when instincts cannot be carried out naturally. This explanation usually accounts for an animal's adoption of young that belong to remotely related species. C. Purely creative activity. Creative activities depend upon mental trial and error processes and constructive imagination that depends upon nervous associations and symbols. Cre- ative activitv is involved in the arts, inventing, metaphysics, etc. Sympathy, curiosity to discover and know what is true, and determination to discover and do what is best for the welfare of all con- cerned are among highest mental achieve- ments. Comments Evidences that innovations occur as an outcome of mental ingenuity for animals besides primates are not common (Holmes 1911, p. 164-259). However, mutations that bring about improvement in adaptiveness of behavior are analogous and per- haps equivalent to innovations. It is possible that when such mutations first occur in single individuals, behavior traits that follow have the appearance of representing innovated behavior. It becomes a ques- tion of whether a tendency to carry out a definite type of behavior or whether an ability to make a</page><page sequence="17">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 355 suitable invention (adjustment) is inherited. Ob- servers tend to consider behavior instinctive when it characterizes all individuals of a species if individuals are capable of showing such behavior when isolated following birth. If beneficial behavior is shown by a small portion of individuals of a species, the tend- ency is to consider such behavior as an expression of intelligence. It is perhaps not possible in all in- stances to determine whether behavior is innovated by individual intelligence. This is a difficult prob- lem to solve for the wasp, Ammophila, which has been observed to use a pebble as a hammer (Peckham &amp; Peckham 1905). The possibility exists that cer- tain tropical bats did not construct shelters for themselves until recently. This trait was recently discovered in several widely separated localities (Barbour 1932, Chapman 1932, cf., Allen 1939, p. 68-69). If bat leaf shelters existed previous to re- cent years, they must have been overlooked by the many zoologists now famous for their descriptions of the tropics, and this seems unlikely. Beneficial behavior may be originating in some species at pres- ent. This should not seem strange as there must be a first occurrence for every trait, and evolution has not come to an end. It is of great interest to know whether beneficial behavior traits arise in the off- spring of one pair of parents and become numerous only as these characteristics appear in their descend- ents. The construction of shelters bv bats suggests that behavior traits may arise independently at about the same time in many individuals. Desires, volitions, and manner of thinking may depend upon random mental activity in combination with automatic or predetermined mental processes entirely guided according to influences of past and present experiences in turn dependent upon quality and quantity of inherited equipment and environ- mental opportunities. Loeb (1918) held such a view. PART C. RESPONSES (Morgan 1891-1930, Loeb 1893a, 1900-24, Jennings 1906, 1910, Pearse 1906-39, Holmes 1907-16, Mast 1911-18, Shelford 1911-30, Holmes 1916, Allee 1926, cf., 1931.) Responses may differ in the following respects: I. Intensity or magnitude of action (Shelford 1937, p. 28, Bayliss 1931). Extremes of in- fluence are (1) cessation of activity, (2) initia- tion of activity. II. Rate of action (Shelford 1937, p. 28). Ex- tremes of influence are (1) cessation of activity, (2) initiation of activity. III. Action may be carried out by direct proto- plasmic response; or may be executed through function of a nervous or humoral mechanism, or by a mechanism involving both nervous and secretory influences (Parker 1932, Hanstr6m 1940) (see complexity of response, Part B). IV. Type of stimulus that excites response (Part D), and kind of sense that responds to stim- ulus: photic response, color response (Pearse 1911, Brown 1934), thermic response, pain re- sponse (Cannon 1915, Boring et al. 1939) pressure response (Shelford 1929), etc. V. Responses differ according to type of activity that constitutes response: feeding, mating, or fighting, etc., may constitute the response of an animal as it sees another individual (Shel- ford 1937, p. 28). VI. Extent to which response is positive or nega- tive or indifferent to stimuli received including objects perceived (Shelford 1937, p. 28). This category includes orientation responses, but also applies to refusal or acceptance of food, etc. VII. Speed at which reaction follows stimulation; that is, length of reaction time and latent period (Bayliss 1931). VIII. Miscellaneous adjustments (point [2]). IX. Responses differ according to position and nature of stimuli (see factors that may account for variations in research results, p. 173, and Warden et al. 1940, p. 63, 780-783). PART D. GUIDING AND REGULATING MECHANISMS Phvsiological - including psvehological - mechan- isms that guide or control behavior. These mechan- isms serve to guide activities of whole organisms. Some of them guide the behavior of single cells and tissues during embryonic development and differen- tiation (Weiss 1939). Guiding mechanisms may serve for orientation and taxis that lead towards securement of food, mate, and habitat. They may restrict organisms by trap action to areas that lack particular influences and may cause animals to retreat from adverse influences. Recognition, selection, and rejection of food, mate, and habitat, and of materials put to various uses such as construction of shelter depend unon guidance mechan;sms. Guiding mechanisms mav be responsible for the nature of reactions (see Responses, Part C). I. Behavior guided by single mechanisms. A. Activities guided by fundamental phvsiolog- ical non-psychoprojective mechanisms. L. Photoresponse. a. Photo intensity response (or "photo- reaction") pertains to reaction of organ- isms to light, and is not concerned with responses to visual images. Response occurs to presence or absence of a light stimulus or varies according to the inten- sity of light. (1) Direct photoresponse: immediate re- action brought about through sensitiv- ity of organisms to light. Special photoreceptors are not always neces- sary, for example, as for Amoeba. On the other hand, organs sensitive to light may be highly complex. (2) Indirect photoresponse: reaction of gonads of fishes, birds, and mammals to changes in photoperiodism; re-</page><page sequence="18">356 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 action of some chromatophores to hormonal regulators released accord- ing to influence of illumination (Amer. Med. Assoc. 1935, p. 271, Hanstrom 1940). b. Photo wave-length response; occurs for organisms that may or may not form mental coneepts of colors, yet react dif- ferently to widely different wave-lengths. 2. Cheino-reaction. This reaction involves those activities controlled by way of a sim- ple chemical sense, gustatory sense, or olfac- tory sense (Imms 1937, Powers 1941). 3. Gravity-reaction. Centrifugal force reaction. a. Ortho-gravity reaction: negative reaction to gravity leads some kinds of caterpillars to food (Loeb 1918). See magnetic re- sponse. The force of gravity is repro- duceable by centrifugal force, although the pull of objects towards the earth is not due to centrifugal force. b. Diagravity or lateral gravity reaction (diageotropism) as shown by twining plants (Rober 1929, Stiles 1936). 4. Thigmoreaction. For example, withdrawal reaction of shell-bearing mollusks when touched by moving objects. Thigmoreac- tions guide some organisms in selection of habitats (Shelford 1914). 5. Push-reaction. Unilateral pressure reaction. For example, some reactions to current: rheotropism. 6. B3aro-reaction. This type of response is dependent upon sensitivity to total pres- sure. For instance, regulation of volume of air in swim bladders of many fishes. 7. Thermnoreaction. Temperature may serve as an exogenous stimulus when animals come into contact with objects or media capable of causing sensations of hot or cold. This is possible only when nerve endings that are sensitive to heat or cold are present in the skin. Temperature sensations can occur only when temperatures with which organ- isms come into contact are different from body temperature. Ordinarily, temperature exerts its influence upon metabolic rates as an endogenous influence, especially for poikilotherms, but also for homeotherms. That is, environmental temperature often exerts its influence by changing inner body temperatures. The result is due to an in- ternal temperature state, and not to a stimnulus. Direct responses to sensation of heat or cold may be designated exothermal responses and the result in this instance is due to the reception of stimuli that con- tinually originate from the external en- vironment. Changes in behavior that result from modification of internal temperatures may be referred to as endothermal results or endogenous thermal responses. Thermo- reactions are treated by many authors (e.g., Shelford 1929, p. 22, 373-375). 8. Hydroreaction. Response may be due to a sensation of touching water, so a thigmo- reaction may be involved. Response to water may be dependent upon water tem- perature or to temperature changes brought about by presence of water. Increased humidity reduces evaporation and thus slows reduction in temperature. Decrease in humidity has the opposite effect. Con- tact with water or selection of special con- centrations of humidity may be governed by the manner that contact with water can modify osmotic relations, turgidity, and water content of skins. It is probable that hydroresponses, humidity responses, and osmotic pressure reactions are interrelated in some instances. Hydroreactions may be coupled with temperature or touch sensa- tions and may act as a single stimulus in rare instances if at all. Hydroreaction and humidity-reaction are listed separately from other influences for convenience and coia- pleteness in organization of material. See Allee 1926, cf., 1931. Refer to II, p. 41. 9. Evaporation reaction (Shelford 1913, 1914a, cf., 1929). See II, p. 41. 10. Osmotic pressure reaction and turgidity re- action. When hands are in contact with soap water for a long time, an "osmotic sensation" is produced. The emptying of contractile vacuoles in protozoa serves to counteract osmotic influx of water. That this process occurs as a response to presence of vacuoles is proved by disappearance of vacuoles when a marine water medium gradually replaces fresh water. Many cells tend to take up water and salt until a high concentration is reached. Finally certain changes (reactions) occur which alter the endosmotic process. A similar phenomenon occurs when cells excrete or secrete surplus amounts of substances required for their own existence (Livingston 1903, p. 140, Krogh 1939). 11. Vibration reaction. Occurs for trap-door spiders (Passmore 1935, p. 229). 12. Muscle-tension reaction. Proprioceptor re- flexes are employed in mammalian balance, especially when sight (IB, 1, a) and semi- circular canals are eliminated from action (IIC, 2). 13. Magnetic response. Galvanoresponse (Loeb 1918, Warner et al. 1935-40, Stetson 1937). Response to gravity has no dependence upon sensitivity to magnetic waves ("mag- netism" ). It has not been proved that organisms encounter electric currents in</page><page sequence="19">October, i942 BEEIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 357 natural habitats nor that they respond to magnetic waves. B. Behavior guided by single psychoprojection conceptions. Objects and sensations perceived in space are projected in mind through a phenomenon of imnagination. Space-perception and perception of feelings, objects, and hap- penings in space is consciousness when prac- tically coincident with and brought about by actuality. The accuracy that characterizes judgment of distance by mantids, kingbirds, and chameleons as they attack their prey proves that the images seen by these animals occur within protoplasm. The optical images and what happens to these images are re- created in a mental world that represents the world of reality. Consciousness requires no other criterion, assuming that it is correct to rule out the sensation of self-consciousness as unimportaiit. Self-consciousness is probably not an essential characteristic of consciousness. It is unknown to most young children and is not a continuous mental experience for adults. We do not react directly to the objects which we see. Our responses are to mental con- cepts of objects which we project into space. When objects and happenings are located practically where they seem to be located, con- sciousness is being experienced. It is impor- tant to regard consciousness as not quite coincident with actuality. Objects under water when viewed from the air are not seen where they are located. The sun is seen only after its light travels for eight minutes, so the sun is usually two degrees further in its course than what it seems to be. At a distance of 1,090 feet, animals hear sounds one second after sound producing vibrations are created. Common perceptions usually occur almost simultaneously with actuality. 1. Reactions based upon sense of distance, spatial localization of objects, and changes that occur in the spatial relationships be- tween objects; that is, reactions to objects conceived in space. A chameleon's capture of a fly illustrates a response that involves a sense of distance and spatial localization of an object. Spatial localization is accom- plished by several mental mechanisms, and responses may be classified according to the type of mental phenomenon that serves to create a mental spatial concept. a. Vision response. Visual image reaction. The sense of distance and localization of objects reaches greatest perfection through creation of mental space concepts by means of bifocal vision. Perception of depth is probably acquired as organisms learni the significance of shadows, high- lights, and angles. Many animals em- ploy "psychoprojection movement" (e.g., rapidly turning or swaying the head); occurs f or wrens, owls, humming birds, and mantids. Such movements provide images of objects at different angles and afford a basis for judgment of distance similar to that of bifocal vision. b. Auditory reaction. Spatial localization of vibrations ("sound"). c. Odor response. d. Taste response. e. Touch response. f. Psychothermal response. Responses to feeling of heat or cold. g. Pain response. h. Articular localization response. The sense of position of body parts is dependent upon skin and muscular sensations. i. Tickle sensation response. 2. Reactioii to symbols. Concepts may symbo- lize pain, bitter taste, satisfaction, insig- nificance, unknown significance (concepts that lead to curiosity), etc. These mental concepts are created in mind by way of the senses and nerves which serve as inter- mediaries between conscious centers and environment. The concepts become symbols through direct experience with objects or through what is learned from other indi- viduals. 3. Reaction to perception of weight. Sense of weight is often a mental concept probably dependent upon the touch, muscular, and pressure senses. Reaction to gravity can be -in part at least-a reaction to an animal's sense of the weight of its own body parts. 4. Reaction to perception of proportion. Many animals including humans rely upon their recognition of characteristic body pro- portions in reacting positively to members of their species and negatively to enemies. 5. Reaction to concept of speed (see 6). 6. Reaction to concepts of time and space- time; occurs when used by predators as they attack rapidly moving prey. Kingfishers can capture a moving fish by striking where the fish will be. This involves attempting to strike ahead of the actual location of prey. Humans use this sense in estimating distance they have traveled during a definite period of time, and it is possible-but not likely-that some migrating animals also rely upon this criterion of distance trav- eled. This is possible only when a concept of speed of travel is also present. 7. Optic sense; taking advantage of any prin- ciple of optics. Kingfishers, gulls, terns, and certain other birds strike accurately at objects under water regardless of the fact that due to diffraction of light as the latter passes from one medium into another of different density objects under water are</page><page sequence="20">358 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 not where they appear to be at most angles of observation above water. 8. Responses to ultra-abstract concepts; that is, to concepts of right and wrong, truth, beauty, theory of relativity, etc. Such highly abstract conicepts guide human social behavior and the planning of research, etc. II. Behavior guided by compound response mech- anisms. A. Compound complementary physiological re- actions. Psychoprojection is not involved. 1. Osmothermic evaporation reaction. It is not conceivable that evaporation exerts any influence by its process alone. Evaporation may modify temperature and can bring about a decrease in water content of eells such as those which form skins. 2. Thigmopressure reaction. Touch and pres- sure stimuli probably act together in some instances. 3. Hydroreactions are usually as complex as evaporation reactions. Reaction to contact with water may involve temperature, pres- sure, osmotic, and chemical reception in any combination. B. Compound supplementary reactions. Psycho- projection may be involved. Response occurs to one type of stimulus but is conditioned by one or more stimuli of other kinds than the one which excites a definite type of response (p. 173-177). 1. Chemically conditioned photoreaction (Welsh 1930). 2. Photo-thermic reaction. Tendenev for re- aetion to light may be reversed or eradi- cated by temperatures above or belqw cer- tain limits. 3. Gravity-pressure reaction. Tendency for reaction to gravity may be reversed or eliminated by total pressures above or be- low certain limits. 4. Gravity-nutritive reaction. Change in nutri- tive state may reverse or destroy tendency to respond to gravity. 5. Gravity-thermic reaction. Temperatures above and below specific limits can cause reversal or extirpation of tendenev to react to gravity. C. Physiological psychoprojection mechanisms. Psychoprojection is involved in one or more of the aspects that constitute a reaction. 1. Unilateral pressure visual response. Rheo- visual response. The orientation of many fishes in streams is controlled partlv by their direct response to current and in part through apparent movement of that which is seen. Objects that are seen do not nec- essarily form very definite mental images, but are probably projected into space in imagination. That is to sav, the photic aspect of response of fish to objects in the environment belongs oni the psvehological level (Lyon 1904-09, cf., Loeb 1918, Shel- ford 1929). 2. Muscular-gravity-visual response. Mam- malian balance and locomotion normally involve proprioceptive reflexes, deflected actions dependent upon stimulations that originate in semicircular canals and response to images. D. Compound psychoprojection mechanisms. Most or all of the perceptions that are responsible for a reaction are psychoprojections. 1. Visual-muscular or visual-skin sensation re- actions. This type of complex is involved in recognizing localizations of body parts, surface pains, etc. 2. Visual-sound reaction. When objects are heard and seen simultaneously, they create a more concrete concept than when only one sense is stimulated. Addition of stimulation to sense of color adds further to the vivid- ness of mental concepts. The popularity of sound and color motion pictures compared to that of the silent cinema illustrates this point. 3. Osmothermic evaporation reaction when psychoprojection is involved. It is not un- likely that evaporation may exert influence in part through thigmosensitivitv, so osmo- thermic thigmoreactions probably occur. Probably an osmotherm:c thigmosensation occurs when one's hands are withdrawn from strong soap water. 4. Miscellaneous. Vision may act along with the olfactory sense to produce sensations and reactions. The olfactory and gustatory senses sometimes act as a complex. Skin sensations may consist of the simultaneous perception of more than one type of stim- ulus; for example, psvehothermal thigmo- response, touch thermal pain response, etc. III. Stimulus production reaction mechanisms. Be- havior of an animal is brought about by simul- taneous response to stimuli created through its own activity. A. Vibration-production audioreaction complex. This mechanism is employed bv bats in locat- ing objects in path of flight (Griffin &amp; Galam- bos 1940, Galambos &amp; Griffin 1940). Blind persons can learn to rely upon the same mechanism by producing sounds in walking or by tapping a cane instead of through employ- ment of the voice. B. Light-production visual-reaction complex. This mechanism is employed by some deep sea ani- mals that produce light (Harvey 1940). C. Chemical release-reaction complex as occurs for limpets. PART E. ORIENTATION Besides fitting into the following classifications some orientations can be classified according to Parts A, B, C, D, F, G, H, and/or I.</page><page sequence="21">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 359 Div. 1. Manner in which organisms orient to stimuli as determined by result of response. Trop:sms and(l o(Iciitatioii plus locomotioii (Loeb 1918, Meyer &amp; Anderson 1939, Wigglesworth, 1939). I. Kineses: (A) ortho-, and (B) klino- (Fraenkel &amp; Gunn 1940). II. Taxes: (A) klino-, (B) tropo-, and (C) telo-. III. Transverse orientations: (A) compass reaction; for example, light-compass reaction, (B) dorsal or ventral reactions to stimuli. Div. 2. Method of accomplishing orientation. I. Random movement or/and trial and error (Jen- nings 1904-10, cf., Child 1924). II. Spiral movements; employed by homing pigeons, wasps, and bees (Holmes 1911, p. 194, Stetson 1937). The function of spiral movements has been supposed to afford opportunity of observa- tion for wasps (Peckham 1895). A different possibility is suggested for homing pigeons (Stetson 1937). A spiral path in a horizontal plane should eventually lead to home territory. However, it has not been demonstrated that any animals employ this method throughout unknown terri- tory as a method of homing. Such a method is probably not used by organisms that have been carefully studied. Homing pigeons spiral when released in territory unknown to them, then straighten their path and tend to fly a fairly definite course towards home in practically all instances (Stetson 1935). Orientation tests for homing tendency should be judged by the direc- tion in which animals start out on their courses when released and not by determining the pro- portion of animals that are successful in reaching home. III. Guidance of orientation by special stimuli (Parts C and D). A. Unconditioned orientation. 1. Instinctive reaction to objects. 2. Instinctive reaction to environmental fac- tor gradients. 3. Imitation of that which is immediately ob- served. Includes following of leaders in migrations. B. Conditioned orientation. 1. Learned reaction to "landmarks." Land- marks may be represented by objects that create images or light-shadow impressions, vibrations that produce recognizable sounds, particular temperature levels or chemicals that produce recognizable odors, etc. Land- marks may be learned through previous ex- perience or through what is conveyed abstractly by way of communication. 2. Learned reaction to gradients. Such reac- tions depend upon associations learned by experience or communication. 3. Physiological memory. Muscular memory (Pieron 1913, cf., Pearse 1939). IV. Complicated methods. A. Intelligent action may be involved (e.g., in- vention, construction, and/or employment of compasses or other special instruments). B. Complex of other methods. V. Unexplained methods of orientation. It is diffi- cult to believe that landmarks serve to guide orientation for many species of bats, especially in long migrations. Some migration routes of bats follow those taken by certain species of birds (Griffin 1940, Hitchcock 1940). The orientation mechanism of homing pigeons and many other species of birds is not known (Fraenkel &amp; Gunn 1940). Landmarks and con- scious memory do not often play a part in migra- tions (Peterson 1941, p. 55). Homers are trained to return to their nests by releasing them only short distances from their homes at first and gradually increasing the dis- tance between known territory and point of re- leasement (Lea 1923). Probably training homing pigeons is accomplished by increasing their tend- ency to return home through ruling out distrac- tions at first, thereby causing them to increase their sensitivity to whatever factors serve to guide them. It is important to recognize the significance of a number of facts that concern the homing ability of pigeons. (1) For the total of known records in which homing pigeons have been re- leased over 1,000 miles from their homes, the proportion of returns is high within a number of days following their release. Some return flights have covered as much as 2,100, 2,200, and 7,200 miles (Vance 1937). No visible "land- mark" except the sun could have served as a directional guide in these instances, and return- ing home by reliance upon random and trial and error movement should require a number of years on the average. Therefore, repeated or independent returns over new and lengthy courses must be ruled as not results of chance inasmuch as there are no failures on record to counter- balance the successes. (2) Pigeons that have acquired the ability to reach home when released 100 miles from their stations may immediately be released at distances of 500 miles with about 100 percent success (Lea 1923, p. 9, 11). In such an instance, the gap of territory with which the birds are not acquainted amounts to about 300 miles with an allowance for a vision range of 100 miles. Under such conditions, there is no opportunity for recognition of landmarks upon release. (3) Homers almost invariably start out in their homeward direction (Stetson 1935, 1937). It is this characteristic that should serve as the principal basis for judgment of the accu- racy of orientation. Flight in a straight course may be preceded by a brief narrow spiral. (4) Pigeons reach their destinations when released in smoke and fog (Lea 1923). (5) Homing pi-</page><page sequence="22">360 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 geons are trained to be independent. There is no evidence that some homers follow leaders. Rather, the evidence is to the contrary (Lea 1923, p. 8). (6) Evidence has been obtained from several sources that pigeons may be sen- sitive to magnetic or other electrical waves (Stet- son 1935, 1937, Vance 1937, Pop. Mech. 1937). In reference to orientation of homing pigeons subjected to radio frequency waves, it is held that experimenters so far have usually failed in method of control to make results convincing (Stetson 1937 and personal communication 1940). Stetson's theory may explain a mechanism of orientation that would not require use of a spe- cial sense organ or complex of organs for per- mitting detection of direction (Stetson 1935, 1937). Stetson's suggestion is that sense of direction may depend upon electrical stimulation of central nervous systems by way of nerve cords. If this mechanism is functional, magnets placed over the heads of the birds would not prevent electrical reception. (7) Views of the ground from the air are not required. An injured pigeon with clipped wings has been known to walk its last stretch home (Vance 1937). (8) As flight ranges are increased from one to 500 miles, etc., birds make better records when they are always carried in the same direction for release (Lea 1923). This indicates that pigeons prob- ably learn to respond to some type of gradient. (9) Pigeons make a high proportion of returns when released at places that require their fol- lowing radically different directions than those previously taken (Pop. Mech. 1935, 1940). This suggests that whatever stimulus serves as a direc- tional guide is of general distribution. Pigeons can fly both with and against winds (Lea 1923), so the possibility is slight in most instances that odors serve as important guides. (10) Pigeons have been recorded in several instances to fly a number of miles out of straight courses in going around storms (Pop. Mech. 1935, Vance 1937). This fact does not support the idea that birds rely upon definite courses characterized by visible landmarks. (11) It is recognized that pigeons rely upon vision in finding their home lofts after the latter are practically reached. However, re- liance upon recognition of visible objects in the territory that surrounds lofts can never be im- portant since homing pigeons do not wander far from home (Lea 1923). Pigeons that are re- leased far from mobile stations, the locations of which are set within twenty-four hours previous to their release, have no time to learn landmarks in surrounding territory (Pop. Mech. 1935, 1940). Lofts have been moved from New Jer- sey to Ohio with successful results. (12) Rup- ture of semicircular canals is reported to destroy homing ability without destruction of ability to fly (Hannah 1929, Vance 1937). In the North- ern hemisphere, water moves counter-clockwise as it leaves a funnel. It moves in a clockwise direc- tion in the Southern hemisphere. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the water particles to- wards the equator move around the earth's axis at a more rapid rate than do those towards the nearest pole. Since water in a small funnel is sensitive to direction of earth movement, it should not seem strange if some animals can sense direc- tion of earth movement with the aid of semi- circular canals. (13) The following information applies to night flying pigeonis. (a) The best records which amount to nearly sixty miles have been made on the darkest nights when moonlight is absent (Hannah 1929, Pop. Mech. 1940). Some of these have occurred after 11 :00 P.M. during rains (Pop. Mech. 1940). (b) Nocturnal flights of 20 to 60 miles are as successful over the ocean as over land (Pop. Mech. 1935, 1940). (c) Speeds average higher for night flying than for day flying. (d) Homers reach dark lofts and illuminated lofts in about the same amounts of time (Pop. Mech. 1940). (14) It appears that valleys and coasts are followed as a result of other advantages than the presence of landmarks (Hannah 1929). (15) Application of homing data to statistical analysis (page 53) indicates that chance and landmarks taken together do not account for percentage of homing returns. It is not unlikely that some organisms may be assisted in orientation by general or specific "odors" liberated by different communities, bi- omes, soil types, seas, or lakes. Some animals are not sensitive to specific chemicals to which others are sensitive (Imms 1937). This point may be demonstrated for individuals of a single species as well as for those of different species. Some persons are not capable of tasting phenyl thiourea (Sturtevant &amp; Beadle 1939, p. 43). It is significant that certain chemicals may not serve to stimulate sense organs of some animals- either as a result of their specific constituency or due to their weakness of concentration-and yet be capable of stimulating sense organs of other individuals or species. Sex chemicals of some female lepidoptera are barely noticeable if noticeable at all to human beings. Males of each species are highly sensitive to the chemical re- leased by females of their species. Males of some species are stimulated by these diluted chemicals over distances of several miles (Rau &amp; Rau 1929, Poulton 1929). Chemicals of plant hosts stimulate female lepidoptera at great dis- tances, though human beings may or may not be able to detect any plant odor. If an odor is noticeable to humans, it remains to be demon- strated that the chemical responsible for stimula- tion of the human olfactory sense is the same one to which other animals respond. Mechanisms involved in finding of water by toads and certain mammals have not been demon- strated. Some turtles are said to employ geo-</page><page sequence="23">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 361 tropism in locating water (Loeser 1940). This mechanism may serve the same purpose for a few other animals. How organisms orient excavations so that tun- nels of nests meet at particular points is not known. Consider the difficulty involved in ex- plaining how moles and kangaroo rats construct nests without trial and error attempts to make ends meet that would result in the existence of many blind alleys (Borradaile 1923, p. 93, Clem- ents &amp; Shelford 1939, p. 81). Trial and error, chance, environmental guid- ance, and memory of landmarks have not been shown by experiments to explain the mechanisms by which some organisms orient their movements. The performance of physiological experiments will be necessary to demonstrate what mecha- nisms animals employ to accomplish orientation. To attempt to solve this problem for homing pigeons, olfactory nerves of many birds must be cut, and a portion of those released must wear glasses that prevent ordinary vision. Div. 3. Probability that accident accounts for homing. Probably, for homing pigeons and bats that have not had opportunity to learn landmarks over large areas, the chance ratio that accident could account for return is approximately equal 2,rD to: 1: (Fig. 10). FIG. 10. Probability that chance accounts for homing of animals that tend to locomote in a straight line through regions unknown to them 27rD 3600 2 sin xyor = 1: or 360 When d equals the point at which an animal is re- leased outside of territory with which it is acquainted; dx and dy are lines that extend from d to the outer- most limits of the home range; dx and dy should be drawn outside of the limits of the home range to an extent that represents the distance the animal can see landmarks for the height at which locomotion occurs. The figure is drawn to scale so the addition of the proper distance is not difficult. D + E = the hypothenuse of the triangles. D = the radius of a circle that has its center at d. It is a bisector of angle xdy. .iy = an arc formed by angle xdy as it intercepts the circle. The formula may also be ex- pressed as follows: Chance of 3600 (angle value of sin) accidental 1: - d or = 3602 return X This formula applies as it stands to the homing of pigeons. Corrections need to be applied to the for- mula for migrations of species that follow bodies of water when the latter serve as visible landmarks and to those species that do not tend to fly in straight lines. The formula cannot be applied to any species that may tend to fly in a spiral or at random over unknown territory. Div. 4. Mechanisms that accomplish orientation. I. Orientation by growth, or change in tissue ten- sion (e.g., some plants and Bryozoa). Regulation of water content of cells and growth can control orientation movements (Borgstr6m 1939, Stiles 1936). "Growth" often amounts to absorption of water by protoplasm. II. Orientation by dynamic movement of organisms or specialized parts of organisms. A. Orientation accomplished through protoplasmic response (e.g., Amoeba). B. Orientation accomplished through employment of organs or organelles that push or pull di- rectly against environment. 1. Accomplishment by parts of single cells or tissues (e.g., ciliates, Planaria). 2. Accomplishment by body movements (e.g., Hydra, snails, snakes). 3. Accomplishment through appropriate use of specialized locomotor organs as occurs for some echinoderms, many marine worms, arthropods, cephalopods, and most chordates. PART F. ADAPTATIONS (Dublin 1903, Osborn 1903, Shimer 1903, Lull 1904, Robertson 1906-24.) Environmental influences can alter structure and physiological processes (Tur- resson 1922, Hall 1932, Miintzing 1935, Turrill 1935, Duggar 1936, Clausen et al. 1939, Galdston 1940, Hiesey 1940, Castiglioni 1941, Dobzhansky 1941). Behavior may be indirectly modified. Structures and phvsiological mechanisms are commonly regarded as determined by heredity. However, environmental in- fluences are responsible for bringing about develop- ment or holding in check those developmental and differentiation mechanisms which are inherited. Par- ticular conditions of environment can be responsible for both development and degeneration of mentality, eyes, etc., and can bring about both strengthening or atrophy of muscles and other organs. These facts have nothing to do with the inheritance of changes that occur in parents as a result of environmental influences (Lamarekianism). These facts do explain why it is not possible in some instances for named genotypes, species, and subspecies types to be recog- nized as actualities. Many taxonomic problems re- main unsettled unless it can be shown whether differences that appear to distinguish species or sub- species are due to inherited peculiarities or to thp</page><page sequence="24">3 62 T ILDEN W. ROBERTS I48( cological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 results of environmental influences (Div. 2 and Uvarov 1928). Div. 1. Adaptations in behavior of protoplasm and physiological mechanisms. Complex struc- tures of organisms are not inherited as such. Mutations modify structural development by modifying behavioristic tendencies of protoplasm via changes in the structure of genes. Modi- fication of the dynamic behavior of protoplasm finally leads to a variety of structural adapta- tions (Weiss 1939). Finally, the nature of dynamic behavior of whole organisms is precon- ditioned bv the nature of the structures of which it consists. The physico-chemical basis of be- havior is explained by a number of writings (Goldschmidt 1923, 1938, 1940, Newman 1937, Coghill 1929, Davis 1936, Estabrooks 1936, Gray 1937. Hill &amp; Clegg, 1937, Lit. Dig. 1937a, Sci. News Letter 1938-41, Shoemaker 1939, Brain 1940, Kaempffert 1940, Kinsey 1941, Clark 1941, Gibbs 1941, Stockard 1941). Adaptations to an environmental influence may be structural and not involve dynamic movement. An example of such an adaptation is offered by the shells of snails. However, no structural adaptations can come about except through activ- ity and expenditure of energy. Behavior adapta- tions cannot be regarded as isolated entities. On the contrary, behavioristic adaptations must be considered in combination with both external and internal structures upon which they depend. Adaptations consist of structures with their asso- ciated phvsiological equipment and activities per- formed. Some adaptations apply to factors of limited distribution*. Others apply to factors of general distribution. The latter are the more pr-imitive. I. Xdaptations for procurement of food. A. Feeding mechanisms. 1. Separator mechanisms such as osmotic contact apparatus including plant roots; also, plankton strainers of whales and gill rakers of fishes. Excavation may be in- volved as for Sacculina and other para- sites. 2. Trap mechanisms; include suspension feeding apparatus (current traps) pos- sessed by Bryozoa, rotifers, and such ciliates as Stentor; *other types of traps such as grasping traps, etc. B. Locomotor mechanisms. C. Anchorage mechanisms. D. Attraction (adherence) mechanisms. II. Adaptations for respiration. A. Respiratory surfaces (lungs, gills, trachea, etc.), usually associated with devices for moving them or associated with pumps and valves for moving air or water to and away from such surfaces or anaerobiosis. *Spe- cial tubes or reservoirs may be employed for leading air to respiratory surfaces. 'B. Locomotor mechanisms of aquatic air breath- ing animals (Fig. 9). *C. Anchorage mechanisms of aquatic air breath- ing animals (Fig. 8). III. Adaptations for excretion. One of the most important excretory traits is the behavior in- volved in keeping abodes and general habitats clean. This problem is solved by caterpillars through combination of excretory behavior with egestion. Dung pellets composed in part of excretory material roll and drop away and in so doing remove the possibility of excrement being eaten or induction of putrefaction in food. IV. Adaptations for protection. (1) Secretion of epidermis, shells, mucus, plates, webs, inks. (2) Trap mechanisms such as chelicerae of starfish, etc. (3) Chromatophores and pig- ments or absence of pigments. (4) Timing mechanisms. (5) Locomotor mechanisms. (6) Reflex and deflection mechanisms. (7) Mecha- nisms for dormancy; temporary return of ho- meotherms to a poikilothermal condition. (8) Release of chemicals. (9) Sound production. (10) Tonic immobility. (11) Cleaning mech- anism such as combs (Pearse 1939, p. 323, ilegner 1932, p. 285). (12) Reproduction. If all existing life were never destroyed by nat- ural death and other causes, reproduction would be a disadvantage instead of an advan- tage. V. Adaptations for reproduction. A\. For fertilization. 1. Without sperm transfer. Locomotion of males may be involved (points b and c). The motility of spermatozoa is important. a. Retention of eggs until after fertiliza- tion, although sperm may be released independently of the presence of fe- males and fertilization may be external or internal; occurs for some medusae and hydroids such as Hvdra. b. Release of eggs and sperm independ- ently or in close consecutive order; in- volves production of many gametes. Occurs for some fishes such as cod. c. Release of eggs and sperm simulta- neously during "mating" or amplexus; occurs for some fishes and amphibians. *2. Dependent upon sperm transfer. a. Adaptations for procurement of and at- tachment to females. (1) Locomotion. (2) Anchorage mechanisms such as fore- leg suckers of Dytiscus (Comstock 1930, p. 482). b. Adaptations for sperm transfer. Sperm transfer apparatus is treated by Borra- daile (1923, p. 161, 170). It may be intromittent or extramittent. Peculiar methods are employed by cephalopods,</page><page sequence="25">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 363 leeches, spi(lers, and it is believed the Chimaeridae fishes may employ a frontal clasper. B. For release of immature or potential young (eggs). Apertures are usually present but are lacking in rediae and certain other or- ganisms including certain Diptera larvae in which paedogenesis occurs. 1. Haphazard release of new generation in combination with reproduction of many individuals. 2. Placement of new generation in niches or on special food; may involve use of oviposi- tors and sense of larval food as occurs for ichneumon flies (Comstock 1930, p. 917). 3. Care of immature. (1) Provision of food may involve employment of placentae and mammary glands. Trap mechanisms for food securement, locomotion for food pro- curement, and anchorage during food transfer are usually involved. Anchorage may be provided by oviducts or such pouches as those possessed by Daphnia and marsupials. (2) Provision of oxygen, (3) excretion, and (4) protection have been presented sufficiently to form a framework for further detail (see [1]). VI. Adaptations that assist in retention or procure- ment of habitat anid shelter. (1) Streamlined form (Needham &amp; Needham 1935), (2) lateral or dorso-ventral compression of growth, (3) anchor-age mechanisms including locomotion, hydrostatic organs, secretion, spines, and trap mechanisms, etc., and (4) secretion, locomotion, and trap mechanisms in connection with con- struction of shelters; ability to use tools pos- sessed by humans and tailor ants, etc. VII. Adaptations for dispersal (see [5], Part B). A. Passive mechanisms. 1. Cuarrent or energy trapping. a. Mechanisms for wind transport. (1) Minute size. (2) Development of wind catching mech- anisms. (a) Passively secured; for example, many seeds. (b) Actively secured; for example, spiders (Fabre, cf., Kinsey 1938). b. Mechanisms for water transport. In- corporation of air pockets; for example, cocoanut, statoblasts of Pectinatella. 2. Attachment mechanisms. a. Use of anchorage mechanisms; occurs for many seeds, statoblasts of Pectina- tella, glochidia. b. Living within organisms; occurs in many instances of parisitism and com- mensalism. 3.

Modification of structure Growth or Alteration of Vitalit V Withi Consequient Modification of Behlarior I. Modification by response to temperature or to temperature plus some other factor such as nutrition (II). . A. Wing pattern phenocopies and pseudocopies result for some species of insects when pupae are subjected to particular temper- atures (Goldschmidt 1938). Melanism does not occur in the butterfly, Papilio glaitcus Linn, north of the United States possibly as a result of temperature influences (Hol- land 1931, p. 318). There is a relation be- tween amount of pigment, amount of heat absorbed, and consequent intensity of move- ment (Uvarov 1928). B. Exposure to low temperatures during devel- opment may cause reduction in size of appendages (Doms 1916, Sumner 1915, cf., Weiss 1939) and of course influence the nature of eventual dynamic behavior. C. It appears that exposure to low temperatures causes some reduction in size of adult lepidoptera through temperature influence during pupal differentiation (Holland 1931, Goldschmidt 1938, Roberts 1942). There is thus some evidence that Bergmann's phe- nomenon is at least in part a direct result of environmental influence. There is usually a positive correlation between size and speed of movement. Large individuals of Papilio fly more rapidly than do small ones (direct observations). D. The color bands on feathers are a result of a rhythmic temperature and metabolic phenomenon under environmental control (Riddle 1908, cf., Shelford 1937). Temper- ature may influence behavior so as to affect structure which acts again on behavior (Uvarov 1928). II. Modification by response to nutrition (see XIII also). A. Reduction of food for caterpillars as might result from early onset of winter can result in</page><page sequence="26">364 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 formation of dwarf pupae and development of dwarf imagos for certain butterflies (Hol- land 1931, p. 318, Roberts 1942a). B. Many studies have indicated that vitamins, sunlight, and definite minimum quantities of water and food are required for both mental and physical development. Reductions be- low requirements lead to dwarfism and ab- normal shape of body parts. Both rate of growth and type of growth are influenced by nutrition (Borradaile 1923 and texts on nutrition). C. Kind and amount of food, living space, and other environmental factors indirectly deter- mine morphology and color of certain castes in insects, for example, in bees. Behavior of different castes is radically different (F}orel 1928, Emerson 1939, Maeterlinck 1939). III. Modification via responses to chemical influ- ences. Great modifiability of form and be- havior may be dependent upon chemical influ- ences. Consider control of sex in Bonellia, caste and sex control in bees. IV. Modification through response to light (Blum 1941, Duggar 1936). A. Illumination is known to be important for utilization of vitamin D which in turn in- fluences size, shape, and strength of certain body parts. Illumination influences the amounts of vitamins A and D in milk pro- duction (Chick &amp; Roscoe 1926, cf., Shel- ford 1929). B. Light is a regulator of food manufacture- and therefore, a controller of growth in plants. C. Light brings about development of certain pigmentations (Borradaile 1923, Hesse 1937, p. 532), and lack of illumination may bring about elimination of pigment. D. Some animals do not develop eyes unless subjected to illumination (Noble 1931, cf., Hesse 1937, p. 533). The development of eyes when light is present in turn results in a different type of behavior for animals that live exposed to illumination than what would occur if eyes were absent. E. Changes in photoperiodism may cause alter- ation in structure and behavior (Marcovitch 1923, Shull 1927-29, cf., Chapman 1931). V. Modification through influence of mating and fertilization. Fertilization can account for be- havior and structural differences. For example, consider differences of structure and behavior of queen bees as contrasted to drones. Whether eggs will be diploid or haploid in some instances depends upon whether mating occurs, for ex- ample, rotifers and aphids. VI. Modification by influence of behavior. Be- havior may account for structural differences as shown for certain locusts (Uvarov 1928). Queen ants remove their own wings which in turn makes a type of behavior (flight) im- possible. VII. Modification as a result of aging. Structure and behavior may depend upon changes that accompany aging; this is especially notable in those organisms that experience metamorphosis. This category is of interest especially to tax- onomists and ecologists because many organ- isms are described under two names as a result of dimorphisms that are partly controlled by environmental influences. Among animals that have received two names as a consequence of metagenetic changes are: flukes, tapeworms, some roundworms, polyps, and jelly fishes. The palolo worm divides into two rather unlike parts, each of which were at one time given different species names. In the case of the palolo worm, the time that the epitoke breaks away from the atoke is governed by the state of the moon (Pearse 1939). This category of behavior and structural changes is important because ecological study is required not only for clarifying the environ- mental relations of such changes but for ascer- taining nature of species. VIII. Kind of ambient medium. Metamorphosis and consequent type of behavior may depend upon whether the environmental medium is water or air. Consider the axolotl which may or may not retain gills throughout life (Carpenter 1928). IX. Gregareousness and solitude and change in in- tensity of action modify morphology and be- havior of certain locusts (Uvarov 1928, cf., Allee 1931, Faure 1935, Lea 1938). X. Osmotic concentration in aquatic environments may alter morphology and as a consequene- behavior (Abonyi 1915, cf., Weiss 1939, p. 140). XI. Density and viscosity and temperature of aquatic environments may possibly control modification of structure and consequent alter- ation of behavior. For example, Ceratium, some entromostraca, and rotifers (Wesenberg- Lund 1911, cf., Pearse 1939, p. 67, Carpenter 1928, p. 199). XII. Nature of selection of mate (coaction) deter- mines kind of offspring. Although this cate- gory has a genetic basis, the genetic result depends upon an organism's reaction to envi- ronmeint. Consider the difference in result in pairing of golden and blue-winged warblers to each pairing with its own type. A cross gives a 9 :3 :3 :1 ratio in phenotypes (R. Boulton 1936, personal communication, Nichols 1908). XIII. Modification by rhythmic growth phenomena as illustrated by tree rings, rings of clam shells, and scales of fishes. In these instances, modi-- fication of growth may not have any influence upon behavior. However, the structures listed</page><page sequence="27">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 365 are significant as concrete records of behavior and are often records of changes in environ- mental conditions (Creaser 1926, Hansen 1937, Stallings 1939). PART G. ADJUSTMENT Subelassification may be made according to what environmental factor stimulates physiological or psy- chological changes. An adjustment is a process of improvement in adaptiveness of an organism to the condition of environment responsible for stimulation of either a physiological or psychological change or both physiological and psychological changes. The abilities and tendencies of organisms to adjust them- selves to environmental conditions or environmental changes constitute a class of adaptations. All abil- ities to adjust or learn adjustment mechanisms are inherited either as a property of cytoplasm or by way of what has been contributed by genes through species heredity. The ability to acquire tendencies or desires to carry out adjustments not already pres- ent exists by way of inheritance. I. Direct adjustment to direct environmental in- fluences. A. Physiological adjustmeint. For example, dogs grow hair more rapidly when taken to colder climates. Physiological changes do not neces- sarily bring about changes in behavior or psychological state. Psychological adjustment may or may not depend upon physiological adjustment. This category belongs to the field of pure physiology. It also belongs to the field of behavior. In many instances, physiological adjustments may involve move- ments of whole organisms and may involve response to stimuli provided by the external environment. B. Behavior adjustment. Adjustment in behavior for animals low on the evolutionary scale is likely to be dependent upon purely physio- logical adjustments. Adjustment in behavior for organisms capable of modifying their be- havior in accordance with past experience is likely to involve psychological change. C. Psychological adjustment. So far as behavior is directly concerned, psychological adjust- ments may be equivalent to some types of behavior adjustments for those instances in which behavior is definitely related to mental processes. II. Adjustment to concepts. Self adjustment. Some psychological adjustments such as those involved in recovery from pessimistic philosophies and outlooks are not directly concerned with behavior. All psychological adjustments are dependent upon physiological adjustments inasmuch as mind is a function of a particular kind of sub- stance. PART H. TIMING OF ACTIVITIES Animals and the physiological mechanisms that control their actions may be active continuously or intermitteintly. Intermittent activity may be rhythmic or arhythmic. Activities may or may not change or synchroiize with fluctuations of environmental factors. It is inot suggested that the following outline be used to classify "general activity." The classification may be used for the purpose of classifying specific types of activity: community exposed activity, loco- motor activity, securement of food, feeding, mating, or acquirement of shelter. Many physiological activ- ities of organisms fit into this classification in accord- ance with descriptions given by authors who have treated these subjects. These activities include move- ments of leaves, petals (Stiles 1936) and chromato- phores (Hanstr6m 1940); intestinal movements and "hunger" (Richter 1927, cf., Park 1940) ; periodic development of gonads (Rowan 1938); -migratory tendencies in some birds (cf., Clements &amp; Shelford 1937); nychthemeral migrations for some species of filaria (Elton 1935); periodic conjugation in Para- mecium (Sonneborn 1941). References for timing of activities in the day-night cycle: Park 1937; for timing of activities through the year: Shelford 1929, Clements &amp; Shelford 1939; miscellaneous: Craig 1917, Allard 1916-18, cf., Allee 1931. It is convenieint to employ Part I along with tim- ing of activities in this classification. Locomotion serves to illustrate types of activity outlined. I. Ephemeral activity: pertains to activities that occur but once either for individuals or for par- ticular life stages. For example, mating flights of ants and termiites; locomotion of newly hatched meloid beetles (Stiles 1936, Comstock 1930). II. Continuous activity: pertains to nychthemeral activity and to activity that occurs through sea- sons and years. This type is illustrated by locomotion of many plankton organisms. "Per- ennial" activity pertains to activity of animals that do not hibernate or die when subjected to winter or other adverse climatic conditions that recur periodically. TII. Intermittent activity. A. Arhythmic activity; may be subelassified according to whether endogenous or environ- mental factors regulate action. The distri- bution of activities in accordance with time is also a basis for classification. 1. Opportune activity. Activity occurs when- ever environmental opportunity and physio- logical conditions permit. Individuals of some species of ants evidently rest from specific activities only when environmental coinditioins are unsatisfactory for executing them and when fatigue occurs (1McCook 1877, Flint 1914, Park, Lockett &amp; Myers 1931, cf., Park 1940). Morning-cloak but- terflies and bees are active outside of niches whenever weather permits. Their activities that involve locomotion are arhvthmie so far as seasonal time-distribution is con-</page><page sequence="28">366 TILDENW. ROBERTS Ecological Monogrp)IIS Vol. 12, No. 4 cerned, rhythmie so far as most nychthem- eral activities are concerned. 2. Occasional or irregular activities. Move- ments of inany reptiles and leeches occur irregularly. 3. Rare activities. For instance, migration of lemmings and migrations of individual birds of some species (Peterson 1940, p. 524). Activities that are regarded as rare for individuals may be regarded as occa- sional for species. B. Rhythmic activity. 1. Exogenous rhythm. Environmental rhythm. Environimental rhythms may be subelassified according to the environmental factor or combination of factors responsible for reg- ulation of periodicity. They may also be classified according to whether inhibition or activation are responsible for periodicity. a. Activation rhythm: a rhythm that occurs when activity increases as a response to rhythmic changes in enviroinmental influ- ences. For example, this phenomenon occurs for the crayfish, Cambarus virilis Hagen (Roberts 1936, 1941). b. Inhibition rhythm: a rhythm that occurs when activity is periodically inhibited by rhythmic ehanges in environmental influ- ences. For instance: occurs for roaches (Park &amp; Keller 1932) and crayfish (Rob- erts 1941). c. Activation-inhibition rhythm: a rhythm controlled in part by inhibitory influence of fluctuating enviroiineintal factors and in part by an increase in activity brought about as a response to periodic environ- mental changes. Locomotion of Cambarus virilis fits point c. (Roberts 1936, 1941). 2. Endogenetic rhythm. Endogenous rhythm (Webster 1942). a. Eiiviroinentally-induced rhythin. Acquired rhythm. Occurs in Cambarus virilis. b. Inherent or innate rhythm (not acquired). 3. Composite rhythm (Roberts 1936): a rhythm of activity, the highest peaks of which depend upon both endogenous and exogenious rhythmic influences to bring about their total normal magnitude. Some problems that concern nychthtemeral rhythtms: Endogenous synchronization of rhythms with oc- currence of day and night may be acquired while an endogenous tendency for activity to occur at 24-hour intervals is already present (Roberts 1942). Averages of activity records of many individuals do not always indicate the true nature of individual activity. In these instances, single activity records reveal nmore than averages. For instance, individuals kept in constant darkness may retain periodicity in time of occurrence of activity, but peaks of activity may fall at different hours of day and night for different individuals, as results when synchronization of activity with day and night is lost at various rates. The averages of a great number of such rhythmic records shows arhythmicity; that is, a hori- zontal line when data is represented by a graph covering activity of the 24-hour cycle. The average interval in occurrence of locomotor activity of the crayfish, Cambarus virilis, when kept in constant darkness, is about 24 hours (23.8 hr.) though the intervals between peaks measured to date vary from ten to forty hours. 23.8 hours is the average of forty-three intervals for nine individuals. This indicates that the physiology of the crayfish, Cambaruts virilis, is probably in accord with a 24-hour plan, even though no fixed endogenetic rhythm is present after animals remain under constant condi- tions for a few days (Table 1). The adjectives inherent and innate when applied to endogenous rhythmic tendencies imply that a periodic quality is inherited or inborn (Webster 1942). These terms should not be applied to rhythms unless evidenee secured under conditions known to be light-proof indicates the presence of a 24-hour rhythm that retains this average as long as an animal continues to obtain sufficient food.

If fatigue occurs because ainimals refuse to feed under laboratory conditions, the question of whether an activity rhythm is ac- quired or inherited would be likely impossible to answer unless nutrition could be administered into the blood stream or perhaps through foreed feeding. It is important in investigating this problem for noc- turnal animals to have their rhythmic tendencies checked both in continuous darkness and under very weak illumination, but not under brilliant illumina- tion. Rhythms of diurnal animals should be checked by exposing animals continuously to brilliant illumi- nation. Nothing is gained by testing their endogenous rhythmic tendencies in continuous darkness. For tests carried out in darkness, it is also important to know that every measure is taken to create a con- dition of perfect darkness. It is important to check cabinets and darkrooms for light holes or cracks and this matter should be stated in research papers unless a careful description of dark cabinets is pre- sented. The average photographic darkroom allows "pin-hole light" to enter. Instead of trying to create conditions of perfect darkness which do not occur for most animals, very weak artificial illumination may be reflected continuously from a black surface. Probably the amount of illumination so reflected should be not quite enough to make human visioIi possible. Some problems concerning seasonal rhythm: The question has been raised as to whether con- siderable periodic inaccuracy in timing of migration is the rule amonig species of birds that migrate periodically. An affirmative answer has been offered (Phillips 1913). There is some evidence that many species of birds are generally quite accurate in tim- ing their arriival or/and timing their departure at their northern quarters. Also, some birds of tropical Pacific islands are known to restrict their breeding periods to specific times of the year in an environ- ment that scarcely changes at all through the year. California barn swallows (Hirundo erythrogaster Boddaert) that nest at the San Juan Capistrano Mission have been watched by residents of the region for three quarters of a century and have the reputa- tion of ordinarilv being accurate in regulation of both time of arrival and time of departure at the Mission (personal communication and New York Times index (1930-40). If what is reported is fac- tual, there would be no known explanation for the phenomenon. It is known that some seasonal be- havior phenomena have an endogenetic physiological basis. Consider time of shedding of leaves of certain trees transplanted to opposite hemispheres (Stiles 1936) and the timing of hibernation by the beetle, Cicindela hirticollis Say (Shelford 1929). It is unfortunate that taking of written records of the time of arrival and departure of San Juan Capistrano swallows was not undertaken by anyone of scientific reputation many years ago. It is still not clear that carefully written records are being regularly taken through encouragement of any scien- tific institutions. Other species might be mentioned to illustrate periodic accuracy in timing. The barn swallow is taken for illustration because its reputa- tion for accurate timing has been made by popular observations and writings. It is up to scientists to investigate popular observations and opinions rather than to dismiss them as insignificant before careful investigation is made. The following problems arise in connection with employment of date as a means to measure timing of activities. Seasonal activities of animals may de- pend upon: (1) immediate response to environ- mental changes. Activities in this class may be called weather controlled or climate conttrolled activ- ities. For example, some kinds of birds (robins, bluebirds, blackbirds, and meadowlarks) follow the retreat of winter northward. They are "weather migrants" to a certain extent (Peterson 1940) and usually belong to category (3) below. (2) Activities may be directly and immediately dependent upon endogenous influences controlled by other factors than weather. Activities in this class may be called calen- dar activities. Self-controlled physiological timing appears to be illustrated by the beetle, Cicindela hirticollis Say. It becomes dormant in August and hibernates all winter. There is no apparent factor in the summer environiment to cause this quiescence. Individuals of other associated species do not become quiescent until later (Shelford 1929, p. 154). Most of the more highly migratory birds, especially the tanagers, orioles, the yellow warbler, and other war- blers that winter in the tropics, migrate by night and make their passage as if according to a strict schedule on some invisible calendar. Thev are calendar migrants. Weather does not influence their timing of migration to a great extent. "Adverse conditions might hold them up within narrow limits for several days, perhaps, but on the whole, their punctual ar- rivals are a never ending source of wonder" (Peter- son 1940, p. 526). (3) A complex of endogenous and enviromental influences that are usuallv quite well synchronized under natural conditions: com- posite controlled activities. This point applies to those birds which regulate their migrations largely through internal (perhaps hormonal) influences and at the same time are influenced by climate at least to the extent that their migratory tendencies are in- hibited or eliminated while they are exposed to ad- verse temperatures that are below certain limits yet sufficiently high to permit locomotion and feeding. If mean environmental temperatures are important as regulators of timing of migrations, it follows that time of migration correlates with whether seasonal changes occur early or late in the year, and date of the year is an arbitrary consideration irrelevant to this problem. Whether climatic factors are impor- tant as regulators in timing migrations must be</page><page sequence="30">368 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 known before date of arrival and departure can be considered as a possible basis for judgment of "peri- odic accuracy" in timing. Date cannot serve as a criterion for judgment of accuracy in timing of activities when climatic factors such as mean tem- peratures are important as regulators of timing, be- cause different intensities of climatic factors often vary considerably in time of occurrence from year to year. Time may be an arbitrary concept and an artificiality so far as the expression of physico- chemical laws is concerned. The changes in external inifluences to which animals react may appear later in one year than they do in another, and it is the time that such changes occur that usually marks time so far as protoplasm is concerned. These facts invali- date conclusions that weather migrants show periodic inaccuracy in timing migrations (Phillips 1913). This point is worthwhile in connection with appli- cations of Hopkins's law (Hopkins 1918, cf., Shelford 1929, p. 5, 15, Shelford 1930, Lutz 1941, p. 113-114). To the extent migrations are regulated by inde- pendent internal drives, 35.5 days total variation in time of starting or ending a migration amounts to 10 per cent inaccuracy or 90 per cent accuracy for periods of 365 days (the average of intervals that occurs in repetition-not reversal-of migrations in a particular direction). Endogenetic rhythms may be significant even though their peaks vary in time of occurrence by an error of thirty or even more per cent when 100 time units represent the average time space between peaks. Consider the extent that the endogenous nychthemeral locomotor rhythm varies for the crayfish, Cambarus virilis (see p. 366 and Table 1). These considerations invalidate conclu- sions that calendar migrants are not reasonably accurate in timing migrations (Phillips 1913). Analysis of stomach contents to determine time of feeding. In order that stomach contents may serve as a criterion for determination of when natural food is eaten, a knowledge of habitat conditions is necessary. Food should not be available as a result of unnatural conditions. Nocturnal beetles have commonly been found in sparrow stomachs. It was at first assumed that sparrows probably secured such nocturnal ani- mals from their natural habitats. It was finally ob- served that sparrows eat many exhausted or dead animals that fall at the bases of street lights. The fact that artificial light attracts nocturnal beetles ex- plained how it happens that many nocturnal animals are made available to sparrows. By analyzing stomach contents of wood rats at regular intervals through the day, it was possible to determine the time at which feeding occurred both inside and outside of niches (Spencer 1941). A similar study has been made for hawks and owls (R. Lindeborg 1942, personal communication). According to Hamilton (1941), experimental meth- ods probably can but rarely if ever reveal what foods mammals normally take from their natural habitats. When it is not possible to employ other methods, the offering to laboratory animals of a great variety of foods taken from their habitats should indicate the probable nature of normal foods. The larvae of the butterfly, Papilio cresphontes Cramer do not accept any food plants except those upon which the females of their species are known to deposit eggs (direct observations). This rule does not hold true for Papilio glaucus Linn. PART I. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ENDOGENOUS AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES IN GUIDANCE BEHAVIOR I. Inherited behavior tendency. II. Inherited tendency modified by acquired features. III. Completely "acquired" tendency. If determinism is an actuality, then no behavior is completely acquired, and the arrival of inventions is pre- determined, perhaps partly as a result of chance but not by "freedom" of thought. IV. Acquired tendency modified by addition of ac- quired new features. Whether environment or heredity are more impor- tant in controlling activities is not an important question. It need not be answered, for heredity and environment cannot be separated. All capabilities to carry out acts are inherited. But, not a single ability can function unless offered opportunity by proper environmental conditions. This law applies to activ- ities involved in physiological processes including embryonic development and differentiation as well as to dynamic acts. What activities are carried out by adult organisms and the nature of such activities con- tinues to depend upon both heredity and environment, and to attempt to decide which is more important is like trying to decide whether the motor, or the gas- oline and track are more important for the running of a diesel locomotive. Many activities that are often referred to as ac- quired are modifications of activities that already exist. Modified tendencies owe part of their char- acteristics to heredity and part to environmental influences. Both inherited and acquired tendencies may be modified through (1) learning, (2) changes that accompany aging or development of sexual maturity, (3) imitation of what is seen or learned abstractly, or (4) by way of intelligent or creative activities. Therefore, behavior does not fall into two natural classes such as inherited behavior and acquired be- havior. The questions of importance are: (1) the extent that environmental stimuli are important in instiga- tion and maintenance of protoplasmic functions, and the extent that endogenous influences function inde- pendently of environmental stimulation. (2) The extent that previous experience, learning, and intelli- gence modify behavior tendencies. It should be understood that environmental control or environmental guidance does not mean that con- trol in the last analysis is not internal. Control of activities is always fundamentally taken care of</page><page sequence="31">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 369 within cytoplasm except when organisms are forced by externial meanis (poinit 2, p. 371). In some in- stances, however, activities are at the mercy of en- vironmental stimuli; hence, "environmental control." In other instances, no matter what the environment is like-within normal limits-behavior remains the same; hence, "self-control." In other instances, activ- ities are prompted by internal influences, yet guided by external stimuli, and come under the category of "auto-environmental guidance." It is convenient to incorporate a consideration of the functions played by cytoplasmic, nervous, and hormonal mechanisms in this classification. When the nervous mechanism is important, the question arises whether consciousness is experienced as activ- ities are carried out. When there is evidence that animals experience consciousness, it is desirable to know whether desire, volition, free will, intelligence and creative thought play a part in controlling their activities. Typical species beharior (may be modified accord- ing to Part J). Atypical behavior is covered by Part K. I. Environmental regulation (independent of in- ternal drives). Instigation and maintenance of activity are brought about through environmental stimulation. Both instigation and maintenance of activity depend upon stimulation by an en- vironmental influence for the duration of action. A. Direct environmental regulation. Direct pro- toplasmic reaction controls some activities, as when Amoeba reacts to light. B. Remote control or indirect environmental regulation. 1. Nervous control. Control of activity de- pends upon nervous activation of effectors. For example, reflexes and deflections. Some chromatophoral activities are regulated through nervous control in turn stimulated by environmental influences. This category pertains to behavior controlled by guiding mechanisms when stimuli lead to predictable responses not dependent upon interrnal drives. When responses involve internal drives, they belong to the category of auto- environmental guidance. 2. Hormonal control. This type of control is not dependent upon transmission of nervous impulses to effectors, although secretions that control activity may be liberated from glands that are activated by nerves. Activ- ities that fall into this class include: growth, some instances of metamorphosis, periodic development of gonads and migrations of some birds when their migratory tendencies are governed by day length; some instances of chromatophoral control. 3. Neurohuinoral control. This class may be considered a subdivision of point 2 above (Parker 1932, Hanstrom 1940). II. Environgenative control. Exogenative control. Externally activated niative control. In this class, stimuli that excite initiation of activity originate outside of animals, and the activity is main- tained by endogenous tendency. This type of control accounts for breathing in humans in those instances when breathing must be arti- ficially forced at birth. III. Conditioned control or "endex-environmental con- trol." Endogenous ex-environmental control; that is, endogenetic control dependent upon pre- vious environmental influence. This type of control is characterized by internal influences that depend upon the physiological or psycho- logical state brought about through past environ- mental influence. Such a state remains for a time after the stimulus responsible for internal change is no longer effective. A. Control dependent upon hormonal influences. For example, migratory tendencies that are initiated by changes in day length. B. Control dependent directly upon structures altered by modifications during normal growth (see modified growth phenomena). C. Control dependent upon nervous conditioning as when behavior is instigated and maintained by memory of objects. D. Control dependent upon physiological con- ditioning. This mechanism accounts for Hop- kins's host selection principle when food eaten by larvae consists of plants normally selected by adults. IV. Self guidance. Self control. Spontaneous be- havior. A. Native control. Inherited behavior. Virgin behavior independent of environmental stimu- lation. This category includes behavior con- trolled by various drives without presence of specific external stimuli while the environ- ment is appropriate for normal activity. For example, activity brought about directly by hunger, and wandering movements adapted to species securement of food or other necessity when no indications of presence of such ob- jects exist. Wandering of newly-hatched wasps leads them to their prey without the wasps having a knowledge of any purpose of their movements and without visual knowledge of what their particular larval host consists. This category includes physiological tenden- cies to eat, to mate, to secure shelter, and to sleep. Nervous phenomena are usually in- volved (always involved for many higher ani- mals) if it is assumed that8cytoplasm of single- celled animals possesses a nervous property. This category includes those activities that are guided by mental concepts such as thoughts of food, etc., not immediately dependent upon environrnental stimulation for their creation or occurrence in mind.</page><page sequence="32">370 TILDEN W.

Through direct nervous control; for ex- ample, singing in canaries (Shoemaker 1939). b. Independent of direct nervous control; for example, some aspects of metamor- phosis (Hanstrdm 1940). 2. Activity independent of hormones; for example, securement of shelter through secretory activity or by secretion and pas- sive selection, locomotor movements of plankton organisms, some examples of nomadism, spontaneous locomotion of Amoeba. B. Acquired behavior. Behavior in this category is entirely new for individuals. Acts may be acquired in at least three ways. 1. Acquirement tbrough learning (memory). a. Acquirement by imitation; for instance, smoking. (1) Imitation of that which is directly observed. (2) Imitation of that which is learned through abstraction, as by way of communication. b. Acquirement by accidental experience, as when trial-and-error actions that are suc- cessful are repeated. 2. Acquirement by invention. Smoking orig- inated as an invented act. V. Auto-environmental guidance. Behavior tendency may be inherited or acquired. Environmental stimulation is important, but activity is not al- ways an immediate result of environmental stimulation for any particular stimulus. Self- guidance and environmental influence and usually nervous phenomena are involved. Nervous phe- nomena may be said to be always involved when it is presumed that cytoplasm possesses a nervous property. Nerves of animals have developed through the improvement of a nervous property already characterized by cytoplasm. A. Activity independent of hormonal control. This class includes homing of limpets, many trial-and-error actions, and activities guided by such complexes as hunger plus observance of food. See learning, p. 27 and modified behavior, Part J. B. Activity under humoral control or regulation. The extent that an animal tends to dominate others before opportunity occurs for the na- ture of other individuals of a group to be learned illustrates an instance of guidance partly by the appearance of objects in the environment and in part by an endogenous tendency controlled by a physiological mech- anism. [Another factor-modification of be- havior through learning-occurs when an animal's attempts to dominate other individuals are unsuccessful and when it is domineered by other individuals. See references on social hierarchy including "peck order" (Allee 1931) ]. PART J. MODIFIED BEHAVIOR For clarification of abnormal behavior, see Part K. References: physiology and psychology texts. This category differs from acquired tendency and acquired action. Acquired tendencies and actions are entirely new to individuals. They are-in a sense- modifications in native behavior but are not modifica- tions of specific tendencies or acts already existent. Modifications in native behavior that are completely new belong to the category of Innovation (Part B, Div. 2, V). "Modifications" in this outline apply especially to particular tendencies and actions that already exist. Many modifications occur for behavior tendencies that are inherited. Other modifications occur for actions that are previously acquired or inherited and already modified to some extent. Not all modifications are "acquired" in the usual sense as through imitationi or learning. Modifications in behavior may occur as a result of changes that accompany aging and senescence, development of sex- ual maturity, injury, metamorphosis, or in accordance with what opportunity offers to behavior expression. Modification in some behavior traits occurs through other types of experience than behavior experience, as illustrated by certain influences of physiological or growth experience. Modifications of behavior for some animals mav be ac(luired by way of physiolog- ical or/and psychological adjustment and may depend upon invention of new features of action. Modifications listed below may apply to any of the categories of behavior listed elsewhere in this outline. There are no behavior traits which are immune to modification influences. Endogenous changes are often but not always brought about by environmental forces or changes. Some endogenous modifications occur as a result of internal changes that are independent of environ- mental changes so long as environmental conditions remain normal. All individual behavior is typical for individuals since the behavior of individuals follows laws that depend upon (1) inheritance, (2) the nature of op- portunity that is available for expression of inherited tendency, and (3) change of initial inherited tend- ency by direct or past environmental influence. The end results would probably always be predictable for normal individuals, and therefore be typical for species if all facts could be known concerning the heredity, past experience and its modification of be- havior tendencies, and nature of all environmental opportunities that are available to individuals pre- vious to the point of behavior analysis. I. Environmental regulation of modification. A. Modification by absence or rarity of objects normally used. When environmental objects are lacking that are rnormally used, normal behavior is modified. Environmental influi-</page><page sequence="33">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 371 ence may in this manniier cause modification in behavior concerne(d with construction of shel- ters when exogenetic materials are employed. The same rule ap)plies to substitution of foods. 1. Modificationi by substitutioni of different ob- jects. Sonie carnivores will eat vegetation rather than starve. 2. Modification by substitution of a new act; for examnple, migration from areas in which food is scarce or absent. 3. Modification by inhibition. Animals do not eat when no food is available. B. Modification by extent of availability or in- tensity of influences. 1. Free modification. The behavior of animals after they are washed into caves is not normal in some respects. It is modified in p)art by the alteration of enviroiimental coniditions. To be treated comprehensively, this subject would need to cover the in- fluence that all environmental factors can bring about ill behavior, depending upon an animal's contact with light, water, food, enemies, (drugs, pressures, etc. 2. Forced modification. Behavior forced by environmental mechanisms. An animal's behavior can be modified by trap mecha- riisms or other environmental forces to the extent of inhibition of all activities (death'). Modification of behavior by mere exposure to predators is not in itself forced by ex- ternal means. Animals may be carried by win(ls, hurricanes, and currents, etc. a. Forced activation; for example, seed filaments of Stipa are forced to curl as a result of desiccation so that the seeds are pushed into soil (Coulter et al. 1931, p. 445). b. Forced inhibition of movement; occurs when animals are frozen in ice. C. Modification according to number of influences that are effective simultaneously. See modi- fications by supplementation, antagonism, and conversion. Confusion is one type of modi- cation that occurs when a number of stimuli are present at once. II. Change in behavior through direct environmental modification of physiological phenomena (in- cludes modification of vitality and growth phe- nomena, Part G). In this category modification occurs as a result of internal changes that are in some way closely dependent upon influences that come from the environment. A. Direct environmental modification of vital physiological processes. 1. Modification by alteration in availability of oxygen to respiratory (including circula- torv) svstems. 2. Modification by alteration of availability of water to suirfaces of animals (when direct contact with water is normally required for locomotion or osmotic processes, etc.). 3. Modification by injury or obliteration of mechanisms, as when organs are amputated (belongs in Part K). 4. Modification by temperature. Temperature modifies viscosity of protoplasm and circu- lation fluids, surface tension, osmotic mech- anisms, etc. Modification of such processes changes behavior-especially in regard to rate of processes. Extreme consequences are injury, inhibition of action, death. 5. Modification by pressure. External osmotic concentrations influence osmotic processes (Krogh 1939, 1941). 6. Modification by circulatory disturbances, as when viper venom enters the blood stream of mammals (Harris 1938). 7. Modification by digestive disturbance, as when poisons are eaten that cause indiges- tion, regurgitation, etc. B. Direct modification of nervous phenomena. 1. Through modification of receptors. Over- stimulation may be injurious and may cause increase or decrease in sensitivity of re- ceptors. Consider the influence of over- stimulation of the eyes of man by bright light. Understimulation can cause degen- eration of sense organs, and stimulation may be required for maintenance of re- ceptors (Noble 1931, cf., Hesse 1937, p. 533). Extent of sensitivity also depends upon the extent that receptors have been conditioned to stimuli of normal intensity. 2. Through modification of the principal nerv- vous center. a. Modification by chemical influence. (1) Modification by invigoration of par- ticular mental functions, as bv intox- ication. (2) Modification by inhibition of special or all mental functions by narcotics or other specific chemicals. (3) Modification of sensitization, as by alcohol. b. Modification by pressure, as received by blows or skull fractures, as when fol- lowed by coma or insanity. c. Modification by temperature, as delirium that accompanies high fevers. d. Modification dependent upon direct nerv- ous stimulation received through syrn- pathetic or other nerves. (1) Modification dependent upon extent of present stimulation. (a) Overstimulation (either in inten- sity or duration of stimuli); for example, temporary inisanity due to excessive pain.</page><page sequence="34">372 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographis Vol. 12, No. 4 (b) Un(lerstimulation either in inten- sity or duration of stimuli. Some instances of stupor, hypnosis, and sleep. (2) Modification dependent upon previous experience. (a) Overstimulation (either in inten- sity or duration of stimuli). For instance, some types of insanity, shell shock, knock-outs by way of the solar plexus. (b) Understimulation (either in in- tensity or dur ation of stirnuli). Some instances of stupidity and mental degeneration. e. Modification depenident upon thought ob- sessions, fears, anid disappointments caused by overstrenigthening of thought associations. (1) Modification depenident upon present overstimulation; for example, some instances of tenmporary and curable insanity. (2) Modification dependent upon previous ovei stiiulatiori; for instance, some foirms of insanity. 3. Thlough rnodification of nerve paths that extend between nervous centers and recep- tors or effectors. a. Modification by chemical influence. (1) Modification by invigoration as by stimulants. (2) Modification by inhibition or oblit- eration; for example, as by the in- fluence of curare upon synapses. (3) Modification by alteration in extent of sensitization. (4) Modificationi by chemnical antagonism or counteraction. (5) Modification as a result of activity of nerves. Alodifications may occur for points (3) and (4) as a result of nervous activity. Fatigue and strengthening effects of nervouis or neurohumoral action belong to "en- dogenous reguilation of behavior" modification noted below, yet are often dependent upon e nvironimental influence as inentioned above under "environmental regulation of modi- fication." (a) Overactivity inay lead to delayed action or inhibition. (b) ITnideractivity may lead to de- genieration of nerve paths and in- capacitation to perform acts that depend upon the nerves. b. Modification by pressuire. For example, nervous impulses can be initiated by pressure exerted upon nerves as may oceur wheni vertebrae are dislocated. c. Modification by obliteration, as when limbs are amputated or when nerves are severed (Part K). 4. Through change in the complexity of nerv- ous impulses received by a principal ad- justor. a. Modification by supplementary influences. One type of stimulus may support an- other type of influence [see guiding mechanisms (Part D) in regard to phys- iological-mental mechanisms and com- pound mental mechanisms]. b. Modification by antagonistic influence. One type of mechanism may dominate another when two or more act simultane- ously. This phenomenon may cause ap- parent reversal of an action (see factors that may cause variations in research results). c. Modification by conversion influence. A particular kind of stimulus may bring about a change in the original nature of a response even to the extent of reversal (see point 2, p. 398). It is usually diffi- cult to distinguish between antagonistic and conversion influences unless special experiments are conducted to answer the problem. It is also sometimes difficult or impossible to know whether or not reversal of an action tendency such as change from a positive response to a negative response is due to previous con- ditioning (Welsh 1930). 5. Through modification of effectors (illus- trated by modification of inuscles). a. Modification according to extent of use. (1) Overuse may lead to high develop- ment or injury. (2) Norinal use leads to norinal develop- inent. (3) Underuse leads to weakness. (4) Lack of use may cause atrophy. b. Modification according to extent of strain. (Subdivisions follow those of a.) c. Modification according to chemical influ- ences as when poisons enter the body. d. Miscellaneous. Modification by injury or obliteration (Part K). Ill. Endogenous regulation of behavior inodification. Endogenous rnodification of behavior may or may not be dependenit upon environmental changes. A. Modificationi that accompaniies life history processes; or, the result of tirne on the ex- pression of heredity. 1. Modification that accompanies inetamnorpho- sis, growth, and differentiation. 2. Modification that accompanies aging and senescence. 3. Modificatiomi that accompIinies reaching of sexual imaturity.</page><page sequence="35">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 373 B. Modification as a direct consequence of action or stimulation. The modification is dependent upon chemical or physico-chemical changes. This type of modification may form nervous associations but is not the process of carrying out actions. 1. Fatigue effect. The maximum externt of in- fluence is inhibition. 2. Exhaustion effect. Substances from which energy is obtained, or oxygen supply, or secretions that are products of cellular activity may become exhausted. The max- imum extent of influence is inhibition or death. 3. Shock effect; that is, nervous shock. Shell shock serves as an example. 4. Strengthening effect. Nervous paths, mus- cles, and mental mechanisms are strength- ened through use. Strengthening effects may be the result of the influence of stimu- lation upon growth phenomena, or may be due to release of stimulating or invigorating chemicals bv cells, or may be due to redue- tion of resistance forces by stimulation factors. This type of phenomenon is illus- trated by the formation of all types of nervous associations including thought asso- ciations. Nervous associations mav be classified as follows: a. Basic nervous association. Abstractions are not involved. (1) Internal association: muscular mem- ory (Pieron 1913, cf., Pearse 1939). (2) Environmental-internal association: as the nervous association that permits homing of limpets (cf., Holmes 1911). b. Semi-abstract association or physiolog- ical-abstract association. An association is formed between an abstraction (such as images of food) and an activity (such as secretion by salivary glands or a tend- ency to locomote towards images of food). This phenomenon illustrates the formation of associations upon which deflected actions ("conditioned reflexes") depend. c. Semi-abstract substitution association or physiological-abstract duplication associa- tion. If a bell is rung when a dog sees food, the souind of the bell forms a nerv- vous association between the sight of food and the ring of the bell. The visual image symbol of food is duplicated by a sound symbol. This is another type of deflected action ("conditioned reflex") mechanism. In semi-abstract duplication associations, one symbol duplicates an- other through a nervous association and a, physiological process is prompted bv a stimulus associated with the substituted symbol. d. Abstract associations are purely mental associations such as thought associations; thoughts may be immediately dependent upon stimuli for their formation. In the sense used here, mental images created through optical stimuli are among the types of thoughts that are possible. C. Modification through physiological and/or psychological conditioning. Many important activities that are modified in this class belong to endex-environmental control. It is some- times impossible to determine whether psy- chological phenomena are involved in con- ditioning of animals to stimuli. Even when modification is undoubtedly psychological, it is not always clear whether modification is by way of subconscious learning or through con- sciousness. It is therefore safer and not in- correct to include psychological processes within the scope of physiology since mental processes have a physico-chemical basis. If a phenomenon is known to be mental, it is more specific to refer to it as a mental phe- nomenon. 1. Conditioning through past physiological ex- perience other than nervous experience. a. Modification in selective tendency. (1) Partial modification. In some in- stances native behavior tendency is only partly dominated by modified physiological state. For instance, most lepidoptera behave in accord- ance with Hopkins's host selection principle but to a limited extent (Imms 1940, p. 286). (2) Complete modification. Host selec- tion for some insects is controlled through what organisms feed upon during their larval stage. This phe- nomenon is unlike a "conditioned re- sponse" because radical changes occur in sense receptors and other organs (Imms 1940, p. 286, 318). It is sug- gested that this phenomenon is made possible by sensitization of the an- tennal chemoreceptors and that such sensitization is controlled by the presence of specific chemicals ob- tained during the larval stage. The problem is being attacked by inter- changing antennal chambers of pupae formed from larvae conditioned to different kinds of plants (unpub- lished research). Modification in selective tendency occurs onlv whein larvae feed upon new kinds of plants not normally fed upon. b. Modification in timing action. Modifica- tion of action by influence of past phys- iological experience upon the rate at which energies are built up and released.</page><page sequence="36">374 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 The fundamental forces of nature are not rhythmic although they may be cyclic. Fundamental natural forces are constant at any definite complex of conditions. It is probable that all inanimate rhythms and all biotic spontaneous rhythms de- pend upon two influences for their perio- dicity: (1) fairly constant and gradual increase in an energy that acts towards a direction of escape, and (2) resistance to this energy that is overcome when energy reaches a point above a certain threshold. The resistances tend to be constant. These mechanical functions ex- plain why water drips rhythmically from a faucet when th2 rate of flow is properly regulated. The energies behind the water (water pressure and gravity) are con- stant. The resistances are cohesion and surface tension forces. When pull of weight increases to points that outweigh cohesion and surface tension forces, re- lease occurs and the phenomenon repeats itself. The same explanations hold for spontaneous biological rhythms. When resistance is never complete and when some release of energy tends to be per- petual, rhythms may not at first appear to be a result of these functions. Con- sider the formation of waves and tides. Rhythms such as cellular motion are re- sults of spontaneous impulses plus acti- vation. Each wave begins spontaneously and it is only this spontaneous aspect that follows the laws mentioned. An example of modified timing is offered by composite rhythms (Part H). Periodic activity of whole animals must depend upon cells in which energies increase. Cell membranes probably offer the necessary resistance for the production of rhythmic influences. The following types of activ- ity rhythms are theoretically possible: (1) periodic activation of protoplasm that tends to be immobile, (2) periodic inhibition of protoplasm that tends to be perpetually mobile, (3) (1) plus (2). 2. Conditioning through previous nervous ex- perience. a. Modification by increase in efficienev. (1) By way of elimination of random movements. (2) By way of increase in rate of action. (3) Miscellaneous modifications. b. Modification by compensation as, for ex- ample, asymmetrical compensation. When a functional mechanism is partly injured or partly obliterated on one side of the body as by blocking out of a receptor, an asymmetrical compensation adjustment may take place so that the end result that would originally have been accom- plished is still achieved. When one duct- less gland of a pair such as an adrenal is injured, the other gland may compen- sate for it. This instinctive phenomenon occurs when robber-flies react to light after one eye is blackened (Loeb 1918). c. Modification by substitution following partial or complete obliteration of a mechanism due to injury (Kiihl 1932). This type of modification occurs when a new mechanism is relied upon that is normally superfluous or undeveloped. This phenomenon occurs for some guid- ance mechanisms. Blind persons may rely upon touch for guidance. Some blind persons subconsciously learn the vibration production audio-reaction com- plex mechanism. d. Modification by availability of product of action or basic stimulus essential for the excitation of complex instinct. The point at which a complex instinct begins often depends upon what link of action is stimulated. Hens and rough-winged swallows construct their own shelters if none are available but usually accept shelters that already exist when they are constructed in accordance with the nature demanded by the species. e. Modification by previous personal or en- vironmentally constructed experience of the principal nervous center. That is, through learning accomplished by prin- cipal nervous centers. This phenomenon is important in guidance of selectivity. (1) Through construction of perceptions guided by external influence, as modi- fication by automatic imitation of mental experience created by per- ceptions of environmental phenomena. Some birds modify their songs ac- cording to the sounds they hear. (2) Modification by thought associations or formation of symbols. (a) Formed by personal experience. Acts tend to be repeated when accidental actions or acts "tried" are successful or when they pro- duce mental symbols that repre- sent satisfaction. Keas continued to eat fat after trying it (Bor- radaile 1923, p. 308). Chicks peck at all objects and in this way finally learn to distinguish food from other objects (Loeser 1940). Peck order tendencies are modified in accordance with what is learned of the extent of ag- gressiveness of other individuals.</page><page sequence="37">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 375 (b) Formed by what is implied by the actions of others. Learning by imitation. (e) Formed through construction of ideas received by way of com- muinicatioII. 1) When mental association be- tween act and result is under- stood. Active acceptance of advice. 2) When mental association be- tween-an action and its result is lacking; for example, men- tal association of punishment or rewards in relation to acts serve as substituted symbols. f. Modification by invention of new features. For exaiimple, the use of forks, chop- sticks, etc., was an innovated modification of a native act for the persons who in- vented their use. To put things in the mouth is instinctive. The use of forks is usually learned by way of points 2, e, (2), (b) and (e) covered immediately above. g. Transfer of training. PART K. "ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR" Abnormal behavior probably does not exist in many of those instances ordinarily considered as ab- normal. Behavior that is not typical of most indi- viduals of a definite age and sex is often the result of unusual experience. In such instances, it is the experience and not the product of experience which is unnatural. A portion of the men who become insane-including those who attempt suicide as a result of war experiences or similar trying experi- ences are normal persons, and their consequent atypical behavior should be regarded as a normal product of certain specific types of experience. Atypical behavior that comes about due to weakness in mental adjustment following the usual disappoint- ments, nervous shocks, and fears likely to be con- fronted by a majority of persons falls under the category of abnormal behavior. The point is that many actions cannot be classified as abnormal or normal, because so much depends upon past experi- ence (News Week 1936, Dorsey 1925, Garrett 1930, Devine 1933, Hart 1934, Davis 1937, Valentine 1938, Cole 1939, Dorcus &amp; Shaffer 1939, Brown &amp; Men- ninger 1940, Lawson 1940). "Abnormal" behavior is due to structural defects of the brain (mind) or to defects of other parts of an organism. These defects may be caused by mutations, by hereditary flaws in genes or by injuries such as those brought about by pathological conditions; or they may be the result of abnormal environments during or following embryonic development (Barker &amp; Sprunt 1925, Amer. Med. Assoc. 1935, Sturtevant &amp; Beadle 1939, Yapp 1939). Some atypical features of behavior are listed under Modification of Behavior (Part J). PART L. PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF AGGREGATIONS (ALLEE 1931) [2] ADJUSTMENT IN BEHAVIOR AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE See [1], Part G. [3] MODIFICATION OF BEHAVIOR See [1], Parts F., J. [4] TIMING OF ACTIVITIES Nocturnal, crepuscular, diurnal, and auroral activ- ities have been discussed (Crawford 1931, Thompson 1931, 1932, Elton 1935, Carpenter 1935, Park 1939). Some animals are believed to be strictly crepuscular; for example, certain tropical owl butterflies (Ham- merton 1930). Their locomotor activity is rhythmic, yet neither definitely nocturnal or diurnal. It occurs under a complex of environmental conditions inter- mediate between extremes of day and night. It is not scientific to consider intermediate conditions within one complex of extreme conditions any more than to regard them as belonging within the opposite extreme. Probably, crepuscular activity is to be con- ceived as a separate category for some animals. Dawn may prove to be a distinct time for activitv for some species. Certain activities of some organ- isms probably consist of two peaks and two rest periods for each twenty-four hours. This tends to hold true for the locomotor and feeding activities of some species of Caprimulgidae (Eaton 1910, 1914) and Caligo owl butterflies (W. J. Gerhard 1942, per- sonal communication). A conception of locality communities being some- what divided into time associations (time "communi- ties" of Elton) has been presented (Elton 1935, Park 1935). Seasonal faunas have been outlined according to abundance of active species: prevernal, vernal, aestival, serotinal, hiemal, and perennial animals or societies (Shelford 1937, Shackleford 1929, Clements &amp; Shelford 1939). The same adjectives may be applied to activities as they occur in or are restricted to various seasons. Recognition has also been given to animals that are temporarily active in a community while passing through it: "permeants" (Clements &amp; Shelford 1939). [5] PLACE RELATIONSHIPS Div. 1. Activities characterized by type of environ- ment. Activities vary according to the types of environ- ments in which they occur; that is, according to the features of environment to which activities must be adapted and adjusted. Amphibians divide their time between aquatic and terrestrial activities each class of which is open to further subclassification. Some kinds of animals such as many species of the butterfly Argynnis (Holland 1931) divide their activities between forest and grassland. Other combinations of activities</page><page sequence="38">376 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 that occur for various animals are forest-tundra, grassland-desert, aerial-terrestrial, aerial-aquatic, terrestrial-aquatic-aerial as for some diving birds, terranean-arboreal, terraneaii-subterranean, terranean- subterranean-ar boreal activities. Refer to classifica- tions of habitats according to their biotic and physical peculiarities (Shelford 1937, Pearse 1939, p. 223-229, Clements &amp; Shelford 1939). I. Aerial activities. II. Aquatic activities. III. Terrestrial activities. A. Supra-terranean activities. 1. Arboreal activities. 2. Shrub or herbal activities. B. Terranean activities. C. Subterranean activities. A. Tundra activities. B. Desert activities. C. Grassland activities. D. Forest activities. 1. In deciduous forest. 2. In coniferous forest. 3. In broad-leaved selerophyll forest. 1. In temperate forest. 2. In tropical forest. A. Arctic-Alpine zonal activities. B. Hudsonian zonal activities, etc. Div. 2. Movement of organisms (Fig. 9). Movement of organisms in their environment con- cerns means of species dispersal and changes of im- mediate environmental spatial relations. I. CoInvectioni. Passive conveyance. A. Entrapment of energy. Current trapping. 1. Entrapment of wind. a. Passive entrapment. Aerial conveyance; occurs for parachute seeds and winged seeds. b. Active entrapment. (1) Wind riding ("parachuting"); occurs for spiders that spin "wings" (Kin- sey 1938). (2) Soaring; occurs for certain birds. Orientation in soaring is accomplished through employment of special glid- ing mechanisms (B, 2). Continuous activity of organisms carried is in- volved. 2. Entrapment of water currents. a. Flotation. (1) Passive securement of buoyancy; for example, Pectinatella and cocoanuts. (2) Active securement of buoyancy; for example, some mollusks. b. Locomotioin; as for plankton organisms that locomote. Organisms that locomote sufficiently rapidly to prevent water cur- rents from controlling their movements cannot be properly classified as plankton. Cladocera and Copepods are nekton when they occur in ponds that cover but a few feet of territory. 3. Attachment to organisms or within organ- isms. a. Passive attachment; occurs for Pectina- tella, hooked and spiny seeds of many plants, eggs of parasites. b. Active attachment; occurs for ticks, leeches, Remora, hookworms, cerearia. B. Conveyance by gliding on ambient medium. Conveyance and guidance depend fundamen- tally upon employment-usually active em- ployment-of gliding mechanisms. This point overlaps with entrapment of energy (A) and II. 1. Passive gliding; occurs for a tropical spider (Lull 1929). 2. Active gliding; occurs for a species of tree frog, snake, lizard, several rodents, "flying" lemur (Lull 1929, Hammerton 1930). II. Active conveyance. Locomotion. Manner of loco- motion depends upon what medium of propulsive force is exerted and upon what method or meth- ods are employed to expend energy. A. Propulsive force acts against water medium. 1. Swimming. Diving denotes locomotion car- ried out under water by organisms that live mostly on water or out of water. Propul- sive force is exerted in water more than on water. a. Appendicular propulsion. (1) Organic propulsion: as occurs for the Gyrinidae, fishes, penguins, water ouzel, etc. (2) Organellular propulsion. (a) Pulling; demonstrated by the use of flagellae by Mastigophora. (b) Pushing; demonstrated by the in- fusoria. (e) Pulling and pushing; illustrated by some colonial flagellates. b. Propulsion by squirting. Propulsive force is exerted through employment of the bellows principle; for example, occurs for squids and dragon-fly nymphs. c. Undulatory propulsion. (1) Cellular undulation. (2) Body undulation. (a) Axial winding; occurs for eels, sea snakes, arid some worms. (b) Lateral-winding; occurs for Chi- ronomid larvae. d. Secretory propuls:on; occurs for greg- ar.nes. 2. Walking or running. Propulsive force is exerted on the surface of water; occurs for Gerridae and basalisk lizards. B. Propulsive force exerted against solid medium. 1. Propulsion exerted by pushing ambient medium. Excavation. Fossorial locomo- tion; occurs for moles and mole crickets. Locomotion fits point 2 when animals move</page><page sequence="39">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 377 through pathways independently of the pull exerted by burrowing activities. 2. Propulsive force is exerted upon solid or semisolid surfaces such as surface tension films. a. Protoplasmic flow: Amoeboid movement. Pseudopodial phenomena may be involved such as alternation of gel and sol. Roll- ing occurs for some amoebae. b. Appendicular propulsion: force exerted directly by appendages. (1) Organic propulsion. Locomotion is accomplished by organs. (a) Walking. Running, if rate is above normal. Locomotion de- pends upon (1) leg movements, (2) spine movements, (3) em- ployment of pulling-tubes (pull- ing-tube locomotion) ; occurs for echinoderms. (b) Springing (jumping or leaping). Locomotion may be accomplished by means of legs or abdominal springs; as occurs for kangaroos and collembola. (2) Tissue appendicular propulsion; oc- curs for Planaria. (3) Organellular propulsion. Ciliary pro- pulsion occurs for Trichodina. c. Measure-shoving, shoving, or measuring; that is, geometrid locomotion; occurs for Hydra and many caterpillars. Termed looping when movements are sufficiently exaggerated in extent to form body loops. d. Somersaulting; occurs for Hydra. e. Undulation. "Gliding." (1) Tissue undulation; occurs for snails and large polyps. (2) Body undulation. (a) Axial winding; demonstrated by worms and snakes. (b) Side winding; occurs for the side- winder snake. f. Peristalsis: illustrated by locomotion of some flagellates and Planaria. g. Swinging and release of anchorage. Pro- pulsive force for locomotion is obtained from kinetic physical energy obtained through the influence of gravity upon bodies permitted to fall. This type of locomotion occurs for gibbons. h. Complex locomotor mechanisms that often function simultaneously or in rapid alter- nation. (1) Organellular plus peristaltic propul- pulsion (Planaria). (2) Shoving plus appendicular propulsion (Hydra, some caterpillars). (3) Undulatory plus appendicular pro- pulsion (some salamanders). C. Flight. Propulsive force is exerted upon air. Gliding or parachuting are believed to pre- cede flight in its stages of evolution. Prob- ably flight may be either preceded or followed by soaring ability. Aerial locomotion has developed in animals of the following groups: spiders, insects, fishes, frogs, snakes, lizards, birds, bats, ro- dents, Dermaptera, etc. (Lull 1929, Hesse 1937). Flight has evolved in the following categories: insects, extinct reptiles, fish, birds, bats. Jumping and swinging and "wind rid- ing" of some animals approaches aerial loco- motion; for instance, Collembola, gibbons, and spiders (Lull 1929). D. Complex locomotion. Propulsive forces may be exerted against inore than one type of medium at the same time. The Sargassum fish, water ouzel, and octopus can half walk and half swim at the same time. E. Compound locomotor mechanisms that may occur alternately. 1. Swimming and walking; for example, polar bears. 2. Swimming and flight; for example, flying fishes. 3. Walking and flight; for example, passerine birds. 4. Walking, swimming, and flight; for ex- ample, ducks. III. Compound passive and active coniveyances in- volved simultaneously. Many plankton organ- isms depend upon locomotion and upon water currents for their distribution. IV. Combinationi of passive and active ineans of con- veyances. Birds that fly and soar alternate active and passive methods of conveyance. To the extent that soaring is oriented arid main- tained by gliding, it is-in itself-an activity. Soaring in itself-when not modified by gliding --permits conveyance by air currents. Convey- ance by unmodified soaring is carried out pas- sively. The entrapment of air is carried out through active employment of wings in soaring and gliding of many birds and insects. Migration Migration is a special aspect of locomotion. Migra- tion depends upon locomotor mechanisms and amounts to (1) movemcnt from one type of env ronment to the same kin(d of environment in those instances in which crossinig or penetration of a different type of habitat is involved, (2) may amount to movement from one kind of habitat to a different type, or (3) inay be nomad e locomotion (Webster) in those in- stances in which movemenit is nAt piacticallv con- tinuous. Migrations may be c'assified according t9) the factors that assist organisms n oriemitation ([1], Part C, I), and E). They may also be classified according to the enviromimental amid emidogemious in- fluences that are respomisible for iiistigatioin and main-</page><page sequence="40">378 TILDEN W. ROBE:RTS Ecological Monographs 378 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Vol. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~12, No. 4 tenaace of inmgiatoly moveinenits (Part 11, seasonal rhythms). I. Horizonital migrationi (Wetmore 1926, Williams 1930, Ileape 19:31, Lincoln 1938, Allen 1939, Pearse 1939, litchcock 1940, Griffin 1940, Mayer 1940, cf., Peterson 1940, 1941, Warden et al. 1940, Powers 1941). II. Vertical mnigratioii. Vertical migration is known to occur at periodic intervals for many organ- isms including copepods and other plankton organisms (Loeb 1893, Jennings 1906, Franz 1911, Schallek 1942), rotifers (Jennings 1900, cf., Shelford 1937), certain spiders (Sanders &amp; Shelford 1922, cf., Carpenter 1928), pentatomid, Menecles (Park &amp; Strohecker 1935), and the milliped, Spirob ol us marginatus. Horizontal migrationis bring about a modification in the biotic composition of coinmunities, and vertical migra- tions change the biotic constituency of stratal socies. Such changes teind to modify food rela- tions amonig or-anisms. Div. 3. Procuremeint of shelter. There are at least six aspects of activity concerned with securement of shelter: (a) securement of gen- eral habitat, (b) whether securenient is a passive result, or the result of activity of the animal receiv- ing the benefit of cover, (c) whether securemeiit is directly or indirectly obtained, (c) what drive (or function) is responsible for activity involved in se- curing shelter, (e) what environmeintal influences are involved in guidinig an animal to a suitable environ- ment and to objects suitable for use in construction of shelter; this point is covered by classification num- ber [I]D, (f) whether the building of shelter involves the use of materials and if so, whether body-derived materials or extraneous materials or both are in- volved. Points a and e are best treated in separate classifications, subdivisions of which may depend upon remaining staii(lpoiimts (b, c, d, f). Points b, c, and f fit satisfactorily into a single classification. The classificatioiis follow accordiiig to the various standpoints mentioned. Section 1. Procurement of habitat (based on a). I. Passive procuirement. A. "Accidental" procurement, that is, accidental conveyance. 1. Through physical factor such as wind. 2. Through biotic factor. Parasites gain en- trance to hosts by being eaten f rom the inanimate environment. B. Placement. 1. By individuals of a species as through oviposition. 2. By individuals of another species adapted for transporting a rider to a new host, as for insect transmission by way of biting, or, by hosts egesting a rider into the outer environment. C. Indirect procureinenit; occurs for parasites that change hosts through primarv hosts feed- ing upon secoindary hosts. D. Growth and physiological adaptation, for ex- ample, developnient of hydrostatic organs by certain pelagic hydroids, barnacles, and suc h mollusks as Ioaithina fragilis (Borradaile 1923). II. Active secureinienit; that is, through locomotion, etc. Section 2. Procurement of shelter for self or/and possessions (based on b, c, f). Nests and other shel- ters conistructed by organisms are records of be- havior (Peckham 1898, 1905, Hartman 1905, 1913, Fabi e 1918, etc., Borradaile 1923, Ealand 1926, Jones 1927, 1999, Hammer toia 1930, Mills 1932, Schmidt 1934, Needham 1935, Kinsey 1936, Emnerson &amp; Fish 1937, Emerson 1938, Cory 1940, Felt 1940, and texts on anthropology ancd huinani geography). Pellets are a record of behavior also and usually inidicate an aniinal's presenc e w ithini habitats of reasonable di- meinsions (Taylor 1930b, cf., Clemnents &amp; Shelfor d 1.939). I. Passive procureiient. A. Without involvemiieint of physiological activity on part of the animal receiving benefit of shelter. 1. Through placemnent. Animals may be placed in relation to niches, or shelters may be built around individuals, or both activities may occur. Both biotic aind physical secure- ment may be subdivided accordiing to whether selectioin of habitat by parent or host is specific or non-specific. a. Biotic procurement. Biotic environment serves as shelter. (1) Direct procurement. Direct secure- ment is obtained for the young of the bitterlinlg, parasites and commenisals when reproduced within a host, eggs and neNwly hatched larvae of plant- boring insects, certain amphibia, for example, the Surinam toad, and ob- stetric toad, youIng in brood pouches of marsupials or the sea horse or Daphnia, etc., eggs or immature cov- ered through "incubation," or through being covered by many individuals as occurs for the immature of Eciton. (2) Indirect procurement through evolu- tionary involvement of other species among community members as occurs for parasites that change hosts wheni one of their hosts is eaten. b. Physical procurement. Physical environ- ment serves as shelter. (1) Direct l)rocurement. Securement may be onlv species dependent as for rob- ills, or may be community dependent as for cowbirds. (a) Placement of individuals in a niche as when eggs are laid in a concealed place.</page><page sequence="41">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 379 (b) Formation of shelter around in- dividuals; for example, skate egg cases. This is accomplished by passive physiological activity or by dynamic behavior, or by pas- sive activity followed by dynamic action, for example, as occurs in the formation of egg cases and egg-baskets of spiders. Criteria (a) and (b) are also appropriate under biotic securement 1, a, (1). (2) Accidental procurement as by pre- cipitation. For example, some of the eggs of cod fish reach secluded places following their release. 2. Evolvemenit of adaptations to habitats in which predators are helpless. a. Remaining in dark hahitats, e.g., cave and (leel) sea ainimals. b. Remaining in habitats devoid of pied- ators, e.g., parasites of dominant carni- vores, organisms of hot springs. B. Through involvement of physiological activity, that is, secretory activity. 1. Direct securement as occurs for Coleps, ostracods, pupa cases, oysters, and snails. Both epiphragms and shells of snails are results of this type of securement. 2. Indirect securement as occurs for gall- insect larvae. II. Physiological activity in collaboration with pas- sive or automatic selection of environmental material (locomotion not necessarily involved). This type of shelter securement occurs for Dif- flugia, Floscularia (Melicerta), and might take place for Cistenides. III. Active securement. A. Through submersion as occurs for tapirs (re- lated to points E and F). B. Through attachment to organisms prepared to attack aggressors, as occurs for Remora and Melia, the "polvp crab." See anchorage mechanisms. C. Through creation of dark habitat. Creation of turbidity as accomplished by crayfish. D. Through finding and fitting into niches (modi- fication of environment is not involved). 1. Physical selection. a. Independent of biotic construction as oc- curs for black bears. b. Dependent upon biotic construction as occurs for hermit crabs. 2. Biotic selection. For instance, chicks go under a hen for shelter. E. Through construction (on part of the indi- vidual receiving benefit for itself or posses- sions). Active modification of environment is involved as well as complex behavior of the individuals that obtain shelter either for self or "possessions" or for both self and pos- sessions. 1. Excavation or burrowing (materials not used for construction). a. In biotic habitats. This category includes tunnelling, dissolution, and digestion (a coaction). This type of shelter secure- ment occurs for Sacculina. b. In physical habitats. This category in- cludes fossorial behavior, carving (a re- action). This type of behavior occurs for kangaroo rats. c. In physico-biotic habitats. This category may involve carving or dissolution, etc. This type of behavior occurs for oyster sponges and woodpeckers (as when food channels or food storage cavities are made). This category of behavior is illus- trated whenever cavities penetrate both secreted shelters and living tissue. 2. Construction through use of materials. Each of the following classes may be subdivided according to whether: (1) ground, (2) cliffs, or (3) various types of objects [(a) living or (b) inanimate] serve to support shelters. Intergradation exists from points a through c. a. Through use of indigenous material as occurs for orb weavers and octopuses. So far as the shelter function is con- cerned, some spider webs are equivalent to the ink screens of octopuses. b. Through use of indigenous iuaterial and exogenetic material. (1) Use of endogenous material most im- portant. Some caterpillars illustrate this point by the manner in which they construct nests and cocoons. (2) Use of endogenetic and exogenetic materials about equally important as holds true for caddis-fly larvae, laby- rinth fishes, and sticklebacks. (3) Use of exogenetic material or mate- rials most important. For example, many birds. c. Through use of exogenetic material only. Humans illustrate this type of shelter securement in the construction of various types of shelters. The same type of be- havior occurs for alligators as they con- struct nests for their eggs. 3. Excavation and construction with materials in combination. The construction of nests by termites and flickers illustrates this type of behavior. F. Through finding, fitting, and constructive activity in combination, that is, the construc- tion of a niche in an already existent cavity. 1. When endogenetic material is used for con- struction of the niche. This type of be-</page><page sequence="42">380 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs TiLDEN W. ROBERTS ~~~~~~~Vol. 12. No.4 havior is illustrated by edible swifts (edible nest swifts). 2. When both endogenetic and exogenetic mate- terials are used. This type of shelter con- struction occurs for chimney swifts and still occurs to some extent for "esculent" swifts (Loeser 1940). 3. When only exogenetic material is used. a. Instances in which cavity is modified as occurs for toucans. b. Instances in which cavity is not modified except as to contents as illustrated by the behavior of some wrens and certain mam- mals. G. Through finding and fitting and construction; or construction only. Some swallows may build nests one year and select already exist- ent cavities during another season. Section 3. Securement of shelter according to the adaptiveness responsible for activity (based on point d, p. 000). I. In relation to feeding. A. As a consequence of feeding as illustrated by the behavior of wood-boring insect larvae. B. As a process necessary for obtaining food. This holds true for moles and some spiders (Borradaile 1923, p. 93, 52). C. Points A and B combined as applies to earth- worms. D. As a process carried out for food storage (at least in part). This holds true for certain species of ants in regard to certain rooms of nests (Wheeler 1910). E. As an indirect result, for example, as a secre- tory process. This phenomenon occurs for gall insect larvae. II. In relation to protection and rest. This category is illustrated by the formation of aestivation niches by lung fishes. III. In relation to both feeding and protection as applies to wood-boring larvae. IV. In relation to reproductive drive. This adaptive- ness is illustrated by nest construction as carried out bv most birds. V. In relation to feeding, protection, and reproduc- tion. The niches of moles provide for a complex of functions. Section 4. Methods of anchorage. I. Secretion. A. Secretion of adhesive as occurs for Stentor and snails. B. Sccretion that assists vacuium formation for adherence bv suction as occurs for snails. C. U'se of spun fibers as occurs for some mol- lusks and insect larvae (Hesse 1937). D. Secretion of weight as occurs for giant clams (po:nt V). TT. Use of hooks, spines, or claws. Claws of ap- r)endages are used for anchorage by mammals and arthropods; spines are used for anchorage by Scapholeberis (Carpenter 1928). III. Use of suckers (Hesse 1937). A. A surface of an animal serves as a sucker. Use of this mechanism occurs for aquatic larvae of water penny beetles. B. Use of sucking organs. 1. Developed on "limbs." This type of mechanism is used by male Dytiscus, some copepods, starfish, cephalopods, some Ranidae and Bufonidae, Hylidae, some lizards, some mammals, certain bats, pri- mates, etc. 2. Developed on body. This mechanism is used by fishes (Remora, Riacichthys, mouths of some catfishes) some frog tad- poles, certain annelids (leeches, Branchi- obdella), flatworms (tapeworms, flukes), some diptera larvae, and May fly nymphs (Pearse 1939, Hesse 1937). IV. Use of prehensile "organs." A. Prehensile body. This mechanism is used by snakes. B. Prehensile limbs. Use of this mechanism occurs for cephalopods and some brittle stars. C. Prehensile organs on limbs. This type of mechanism is used by chameleons, mar- supials, primates, etc. (Hesse 1937). D. Tails. This mechanism is used by fishes (sea horse), chameleons, and snakes, some marsupials and certain other mammals. V. Use of grasping organs occurs for some arthro- pods, certain frogs, and primates (Hesse 1937). VI. Increase in specific gravity of body or shelter. Some fishes empty their hydrostatic organs. Some species lose their swim bladders through evolution. Some caddis-fly larvae weight their shelters (Hesse 1937). VII. Indirect attachment by retreat from areas characterized by currents or pressure influences either physical or biological. This method of anchorage is carried out by procurement of shelter: excavation, finding and fitting, con- struction, etc. VIII. Locomotion. Most fishes that live in rapids. rely upon locomotion to bring about their re- maining in stationary positions. Section 5. Means of dispersal (see [1] Part F, and [5] Part B concerning movement of organisms). [6] RELATION OF ACTIVITIES Organismal Units: Community, species, colony,. symbiotic or commensal unit, and individual. 1. Community activity. Synecological activity. This catcgory is based upon interspecific relations (Pearse 1939, p. 498-533). A. Active particpation. Animals may carry out activities that directly involve or influence other species. Influence may be indirect as</page><page sequence="43">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 381 when behavior is affected as a result of activ- ities of other species. All predators are active participators during the time period in which they take prey. All individuals that locomote outside of their seclusion niches are active participants to some extent, since (1) their motion tends to attract predators, (2) in locomoting in the open, animals go to- wards predators at least a part of the time instead of requir:ng predators to go all the way in obtaining them. The fate of ants that fall into ant-lion traps serves as an example of an instance in which prey performs much of the work that leads to its being eaten. B. Passive participation: passive members are concealed at least to a considerable degree through being more or less under cover, or by being immobile and protectively formed or colored, or through restricting time of rest to night, etc. Passive participators are usually taken only by predators especially adapted for securing them or/and in recog- nizing indications of their presence, as occurs for earthworms when taken by robins, and wood-inhabiting insects when taken bv wood- peckers. II. "Species-limited activity." This category is based upon intraspecific relations (Pearse 1939, p. 458-497). This category concerns activity be- tween members of a species. It may be sub- divided according to reproductive activities, etc. III. Group and unit activities. Gregareous behavior (Allee 1931, 1938); flocking, forming into a circle for protection from wind or enemies, processes that bring about union with a symbiont or commensal, etc. IV. Individualistic or independent activity: concerns activity of an individual in relation to itself only. Individualistic activities include cleaning the body, preening, general use of sound organs without regard to presence or absence of other individuals. Locomotion and feeding while in a seclusion niche, and insignificant reactions upon the physical environment may be included. It is not always possible to determine whether an activity pertains to only a single individual. [7] NATURE OF BIOTIC FOOD AND SHELTER RELATIONSHIPS Phys'ological bases for classification are mentione(d under classification number [1]L. Further classifica- tion has bcen presented (Allee 1931, 1938). I. Complexity of behavior and of relationships that occur between organisrns. This categorv has twvo pr'ncipal subdivisions. A. Solitary behavior. B. Gregareous behavior. 1. Non-social group behavior. 2. Sub-social behavior. 3. Social behav:or. II. Nature and degree of (lependeney of organisms upon each other. Independence exists for many activities of some organisms. This holds true for the nutritive aetivity of nmany plants. Some organisms draw their food directly from other organisms: predator prey relationships and par- asitism. Some organisms depend upon others for shelter or other benefits besides food: host- guest relationships and commensalism (Allee 1931, Emerson 1935, cf., 1938, Pearse 1939). Through special types of associations, some or- ganisms make life requirements available to each other: symbiosis. III. Accidental and causal factors that bring about assoc-ations (Allee 1931). IV. Ecological values and detrimental effects of asso- ciations to organisms involved (Allee 1931, Pearl 1939, Park 1942). V. Constituency of aggregations: homogeneous and heterogeneous associations, etc. (Allee 1931). [8] EXTENT THAT ORGANISMS ARE EXPOSED I. Community-exposed activity. "Community activ- ity." II. Community excluded behavior. Exclusively spe- cies, group, and/or individual behavior; that is, behavior that is successfully and at least tem- porarily independent of the rapid dvnamic move- ments of other community members, although probably a result of influences of other species during evolution. A. Through concealment (cf., Principal Ecolog- ical Activities IV). 1. By inhabiting a seclusion niche without pro- viding significant evidences of presence that are likely to lead to personal destruction, as occurs for most wood-inhabiting insect lar- vae during most of the duration of their larval stages. 2. By evolving through evolution a protective coloration, protective form, and habits that bring about concealment. 3. By restr etion of quiescence for rest and sleep to the night, especially for those ani- mals that rest in the open and do not possess shelters. B. Partly concealed activity as illustrated by cer- tain passive members which allow evidences such as odors, sounds, etc., to indicate their presence to at least one natural-not acei- (ledtal-predator constituting a normal com- ponent of the same community. This tvpe of behavior is illustrated by earthworms and maniy wood-'nhabit-ng insect larvae. 1. Fair extent of concealment as occurs for earthworms. 2. Alrnost perfect comicealment as illustrated bv Tremex (Comstock 1930).</page><page sequence="44">382 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 C. Through dominanice, that is, by ability of ani- mals to dominate possible enemies when at- tacked at any time including their resting period. Ordinarily, the characteristics of exposure and concealment do not hold for any partic- ular species throughout its life history nor necessarily for the duration of any particular life stage. Extent of exposure and conceal- ment may vary, and exposure may alternate with concealment from time to time for any individual. [9] METHODS EMPLOYED THAT INFLUENCE ACTIVITIES OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS. ACTIVITIES THAT LEAD TO COdPERATION I. Employment of attraction mechanisms. Activity that leads to coherence among organisms. A. Use of coherenice mechanisms. Activity in- fluences individuals within organismal units such as members of a species, familv, group, commensal, or symbiotic unit. Activity leads to coherence among organisms that benefit from the activities of each other. 1. Through passive exposure of the body or its parts. For example, exposure of color or form or both color and form. a. As a means of coherence of family mem- bers as occurs for antelopes and cottontail rabbits. Many species recognize members of their kind by their form and perhaps color. Special recognition marks are probably unnecessary at least in most instances. b. As a means of stimulating sexual impulse as illustrated by the influence of courting colors in many birds (Borradaile 1923, Pycraft 1914, Hammerton 1930). 2. Through production of light as occurs for fireflies, some crustaceans, and certain fishes. 3. Through provision of contact stimuli. a. Contact with other individuals. Contact of young animals with a parent may be a sufficient factor to account for their quiescence. b. Contact with product of action as occurs for some caterpillars that follow silk which is spun on paths. 4. Through production of physical movements or vibrations. a. Production of sound (Warden et al. 1936, 1940). (1) By means of sound organs as illus- trated by the behavior of many in- sects and birds. (2) By means of oscillatory contact with environment as illustrated by the tap- ping of woodpeckers. b. Physical contact movements with other organisms as illustrated by the mating stimulus of rainbow darters (Reeves 1907). c. Feeding of other iindividuals; occurs for ants and birds. This point may be con- sidered a part of point b. d. Visual display of attractive behavior or/and production of attractive objects. (1) Peculiar motions. This type of be- havior often involves color display as for prairie chickens and birds of paradise. (2) Building of bowers or nests as occurs for bower birds and wrens. 5. Through release of chemicals; for instance, release of sex and species odors (Rau &amp; Rau 1929). B. Use of interspecific fertilization mechanisms. 1. Passive exposure of color or form or color and form. This function is provided by the petals of flowers. 2. Release of chemicals. This mechanism is employed by plants. C. Adherence mechanisms. Activity that influ- ences prey or host-food of next generation. 1. Use of methods of attraction. a. Through chemical attraction as occurs for sundews. b. Through visual attraction as illustrated by color or color-form display of some plant insect traps and orchid-mimicking mantis (Pearse 139, p. 22). c. Through production of light as occurs for some deep sea fishes, especially the angler fishes (Beebe 1934). 2. Use of trap mechanisms and separator mechanisms. a. Passive function of mechanisms as bv way of growth and differentiation. Activ- ities such as growth and differentiation involved in the procurement of traps are relatively slow and precede the function of traps. Passive traps such as osmotic contact apparatus (roots) and valve traps of pitcher plants do riot depend upon rapid motion to fulfill their func- tion. Movements involved in the function of active traps are relatively rapid and accompany or follow the capturing of prey. Some traps function without em- ployment of dynamic force. Others are useful only when put to active employ- ment. It is not justifiable to assume that nervous phenomena occur only in animal protoplasm. Some plants are capable of making use of a nervous property of protoplasm even though-so far as is known-this property has not developed in plants into specialized tissue deserving the term nervous tissue. HTowever, such a development should be possible. It is worthy of note that the leaf parts of venus fly-traps do not close unless sense rece)tors receive stimulation at least</page><page sequence="45">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 383 twice in rapid succession. Point (1) is not distinctly different from point (3) and point (2) is intermediate between the two extremes. Trap mechanisms that function passively are not distinctly dif- erent from traps that function by way of dynamic employment of force, and activ- ity does not subdivide into natural cate- gories according to whether a nervous system, intelligence, or volition are or are not involved. (1) Traps functioning passively: (a) valve traps of pitcher plants, (b) strainers such as gill rakers of fishes, (c) glue traps of sundews, (d) os- motic contact apparatus, absorption surface traps such as root hairs. (2) Traps functioning automatically through independent dynamic action of trap mechanisms: (a) some snare or wrapping traps; for example, cer- tain nematocysts of coelenterates, (b) some piercing traps that may involve use of barbs; for instance, certain types of nematocysts function by means of spring or pressure mecha- nisms, (c) some piercing and poison traps illustrated by certain nemato- cysts, (d) grasping glue traps of sundews, (e) current traps as used by Vorticella. (3) Traps functioning through remote control: (a) box traps such as mouths used to trap prey, (b) valve traps, for example, pharyngeal valves through which prey is forced in swal- lowing, (c) hook traps and barbed traps as illustrated by tongues of woodpeckers and hummingbirds, (d) glue traps as illustrated by the tongues of ant eaters, (e) sucking mechanisms such as mouths, beaks, and tongues of certain fishes (e.g., hog suckers), birds (e.g., humming- birds), and insects (e.g., butterflies), and suckers such as sucking disks of cephalopods, (f) grasping traps such as raptorial legs as used by many insects, crustaceans, and chelate or- gans that function for crustaceans, arachnids, wasps, and primates, pre- hensile organs as illustrated by the body of boa constrictors and the pro- boscises of elephants, jaws usually made efficient by spines or teeth, grasping leaves as used by venus fly traps, (g) poisoning and paralyzing mechanisms such as stings as used by some wasps, (h) electrocution as em- ployed by torpedo fish, (i) shooting projectiles: (1) as a means of in- capacitation. This mechanism may function by blinding as when em- ployed by the ringhals or spitting cobra. (2) As a direct method of trapping. This mechanism is em- ployed by archer fish, (j) sweep-net traps as employed by goatsuckers. b. Active securement as through construc- tion. This type of securement involves complex behavior and may involve secre- tory activity. (1) Net traps as used by some spiders, some caddis fly larvae and humans. (2) Pit traps as employed by ant-lion larvae and humans. (3) Miscellaneous. Various types of traps made by man include some already listed for other animals. 3. Complexes of more than one method. II. Repulsion. Activity having repulsive influence upon enemies. A different treatment of repul- sion is given under Principal Ecological Activ- ities IV. A. Through exposure of the body or special parts of it. 1. "Warning" coloration (Pearse 1939, Cott 1940). 2. "Warning" mimicry. Batesian and Muller- ian mimicry (Pearse 1939). Each instance of mimicry requires evidence. B. Through release of obnoxious chemicals. 1. "Repellent odor" as provided by skunks. 2. "Repellent taste" as provided by toads and some plants. 3. Poisonous substances as provided by some species of fishes, certain frogs, and some plants such as nettles. C. Through combination of exposure of brilliant color and release of obnoxious chemicals. This mechanism functions when Papilio and Ornithoptera caterpillars protrude osmeteria as a response to attack. D. Through securement of cover. For example, production of ink screens by squids (see securement of shelter, classification number 5). E. Through pretense or bluff. 1. By pretense of aggressiveness. a. By aggressive motions including chase in some instances. b. By bold attitudes as occurs for some caterpillars such as those of the pus moth. 2. By lethisimulation, that is, by tonic immo- bility as occurs for opossums, many birds, reptiles, some insects, etc. F. Warning. 1. Through production of sound as a probable "warning" such as a bird song. A concept of force being a more primitive method of protection than pretense of aggressiveness or warning has been presented for birds</page><page sequence="46">384 TILDEN W. R{OBERTS EEcological MonographIs Vol. 12, No. 4 (Kendeigh 1941). A similar idea is held for snakes (Gadow 1908). a. By use of sound organs as occurs for rattlesnakes, dogs, and birds. b. By oscillatory contact with environment as illustrated by the behavior of some snakes (Gadow 1908). 2. Through gestures. For example, chasing. G. Through use of trap mechanisms (see above). This category includes throwing projectiles as occurs for some primates, shooting "projec- tiles" as occurs for certaini ants, nasuate termite soldiers (Emerson 1926, cf., 1938), certain beetles, the ringhals cobra (Hammer- ton 1930), and skunks. Man has acquired the same mechanism through invention of several types of instruments. 1. Passive overpowerment of enemies by use of automatic trap mechanisms (overlaps with points 2 and 3). 2. Indirect elimination of enemies through construction of traps. 3. Active overpowerment through dynamic use of force. III. Interchange of ideas. Communication. Means of stimulating or discouraging impulses in other individuals (Long 1919, Davidson 1936, Bierens de Haan 1929, Emerson 1929, Stoddard 1931). A. Through employment of sound symbols, for example, speech, telegraphy. B. Through employment of visible symbols, for instance, writing, facial expressions, gesture, smoke signals, etc. C. Through establishment of conditioned re- sponses dependent upon symbols. For ex- ample, pain inflicted as punishment or offer of rewards as occurs for several primates. D. Through application of pressure as by push- ing. E. Through performance of motions as when teaching by principle of imitation. [10] ACTIVITIES MAY AFFECT PHYSICAL OR/AND BIOTIc ENVIRONMENTS OR BOTH For example, coaction, reaction, interaction (Clem- ents &amp; Shelford 1939). [11] EXTENT OF INFLUENCE UPON ENVIRONMENT Animals may be predominant, subdominant, domi- nant, influent, or subinfluent. Activities may be referred to by the same adjectives (Clements &amp; Shel- ford 1939). EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR Discussions that treat evolution of adaptations have been given by Clark (1914), Lull (1929), Craw- ford (1931), Elton (1935, 1927), Ewing (1935), Shull (1936), Kinsey (1936), Emerson (1938), Imms (1937), Park (1937, 1941), Kendeigh (1941), and others. Structural and physiological mechanisms may pas- sively satisfy the same requirements for some organ- isms that dynamic movements accomplish for others. It is not proper to consider mechanisms that are passively effective as distinctly different from activ- ities carried out by way of dynamic behavior. The adaptiveness of a particular species characteristic to environment cannot be judged by absence of the same character in related species, since different means may satisfy the same ends. Related species may possess very different methods of adaptation to the same influence. To illustrate: one kind of organism may be adapted for self-defense by mechanically secreting a chemical that repels "enemies" which would otherwise destroy it. Other species may de- pend upon dynamic complex behavior that leads to the same end. It is appropriate to treat both dy- namic activity and passive activity in classifications that are concerned with adaptations. Mechanisms that are passively effective arise through growth and differentiation. Growth and differentiation and instinctive and intelligent acts are subject to environmental influence by way of elimina- tion of the least fit. This amounts to a mechanism of environmental guidance. Many mechanisms that are passively effective intergrade into those dependent upon use of force for effectiveness. Illustrations: consider variability among organisms in mechanisms that serve for means of dispersal, means of protection, methods of anchorage, mechanisms that serve for trapping, and means of procurement of shelter (Figs. 1-9). There are intergradations between the types of activities involved in the securement of shelter by protoplasm from secretion of a body structure that serves as a support to one that serves as a shelter, from instances in which a secretion is used alone to those in which an endogenetic substance is combined with foreign material, to those characterized by use of only exogenetic material for construction. There are intergradations between functions of shelters from those that serve for reproduction to those that provide for food storage or protective retreat to those that serve complexes of functions. Shelter securement, an aspect of ecology and behavior, can- not be separated from growth, embryology, differen- tiation, metamorphosis, or physiology in a significant or comprehensive classification. For possible courses of evolution followed in evolvement of adaptations, one may refer to several charts (Figs. 1-9) that accompany this discussion. There is a strong tend- ency for activities to be adopted in order of their complexity. It is a natural law that also applies to psychological pheniomena for an activity method or behavior trait of greater complexity to be preceded by activities of less complexity. Consider learning as it is involved in acquiring ability to play a musical instrument. It is not stranige that this law-as well as the process of trial and error-should be impor- tant in both method of evolution of organisms and in thought procedure. Just what activities are rela-</page><page sequence="47">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 385 tively complex or simple varies with a particular organism in regard to: (1) its type of physiological organization, (2) its structural and physiological complexity, (3) its ancestral hereditary makeup as may be judged in part through a knowledge of char- acteristic behavior of the taxonomic group in which the organism in question belongs, (4) its adaptations in relation to the general environment, (5) the nature and components of the habitat into which the organ- ism (a) tends to remain or (b) is forced, (6) degree of intelligence, that is, ability to become adjusted to new situations. The following illustrations show that behavior of organisms follows lines of least resistance. Activities are pursued that are the simplest so far as a par- ticular organism or type of organism is concerned. The least complex methods of shelter construction that single cells can possibly employ are those which depend upon secretion (as for plant cells and pro- tozoa in general). Whereas, the simplest methods that most birds can possibly use in making definite shelters are: (1) construction by means of excavation, (2) construction through use of exogenous material. These methods incidentally determined through this line of reasoning-are also shown to be the original methods used by the first birds and their reptilian ancestors as borne out by palaeontology. For birds, the secretory method of the edible swift is the most specialized in contrast to its being a primitive method for Arcella. However, for swifts, the secretory method is not the most complex, since the "chimney- swift method" involves greater complexity in environ- mental relations and requires greater selectivity by the organism. This is an instance in which evolution is observed to proceed from a degree of complexity to a degree of less complexity and is comparable with retrogression or degeneration of structure as happens in parasites. These suggestions account for a tendency of behavior traits to be recapitulated in individuals in the same order as occurs among dif- ferent organisms on the scale of phylogenetic com- plexity from the simplest to the most complex. Be- havior traits as they evolve for a particular species and those that appear through the various taxonomic categories are comparable by analogy at least; partly, as a result of common laws that govern the develop- ment of both groups of traits. These laws are: (1) following a line of least resistance which is the easiest and most practical for the organism's equip- ment, and (2) complexity being led up to through development of simpler components. It is natural that simpler behavior traits are first to appear among inherited qualities since they are first to occur and prove useful. Probably, they originate and remain through mutation, orthogenesis, natural selection, etc. Gradually, more behavior traits are added, and new qualities arise as modifications of previous ones, so that a heredity-complex becomes composed of a physico-chemical basis for chains of reactions, that is, complex instinct. Finally, in some instances, complex behavior represents a peak in the recapitula- tion of activity traits that developed in ancestors of the species. These suggestions are not in discord with the fact that at any point in evolution, certain traits, especially useless traits, may "disappear," that is, be subdued or dominated; nor do they inter- fere with the fact that reversion may occur. Evolu- tion without the occurrence of intermediate steps is a likely explanation of the origins of many complex behavior traits (Goldschmidt 1940). Evidences indicate that the behavior of molecular aggregates including protoplasm is controlled by laws which finally depend upon the characteristics of atoms (Planck 1937). The characteristics of atoms or their component parts finally depend in part upon chance (Schr6dinger 1935). In other words, one fi- nally arrives at a point where the behavior of matter is not always predictable even when environmental con- ditions are known, and there can be no causal expla- nation for first causes. If every cause were depend- ent upon another cause, this state of affairs would go on to infinity. Phenomena that occur for molecular aggregates are the results of causes which in turn depend upon causes which in turn or in a sufficient number of turns depend upon the characteristics of the particles that make up matter. To date it cannot be explained in all instances why atoms behave just as they do. One cannot conceive of any factor except chance to account for first causes. In the light of modern knowledge, behavior of matter that conforms to nat- ural laws which apply at least to molecular aggre- gates falls within the scope of determinism. Evidently, matter behaves in accordance with laws that can be expressed by mathematics (Rashevsky 1938, 1940), and it appears that determinism governs the behavior of organisms with the element of chance entering in when explanations of first causes are de- sired. This would hold not only for ordinary be- havior but for changes that occur in matter whether it be changes involved as uranium divides into radium and other substances, or as simple organisms become complex colonial units, or as mutations take place in the genes of chromosomes. If evolution occurs in accordance with laws, that is-by way of determinism-then life would probably always develop in the same manner under definite complexes of conditions whether it be on another planet exactly like that of the earth or whether it be on two or more separate parts of the same planet. That is to say, this principle should apply to the evolution of life on different parts of the earth where environmental conditions are similar and where or- ganisms are sufficiently separated to prevent their inbreeding. Determinism evidently plays an impor- tant part in evolution, and genetic relationship is only one of the factors that accounts for the similarity of structure and behavior among different organisms. The simplest organisms probably gave rise to metazoa and metaphyta in many distinct instances and so on up the evolutionary scale. Convergence and parallelism and straight-line evolution have oc-</page><page sequence="48">386 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 curred much more commonly than is indicated by evolution "trees." This holds true for the evolution of behavior; and convergence, parallelism, and straight line evolution should also be important in bringing about the various structures and forms as we see them in different species. The mole life form represents one of the adaptive radiations that mammals might take when they take to the ground to live. Different species of insecti- vores that took to mole habits in the remote past should develop into a "mole." That mole environment is capable of "moulding" animals as a result of nat- ural selection influences into the mole type, is proved by the existence of a marsupial "mole." If the mar- supial mole had been a generalized Australian in- sectivore instead of a marsupial at the beginning of its underground life, it would now be arbitrarily in- cluded in a mole, shrew, or mole-shrew "family." Therefore, criteria upon which phyla, orders, etc., are based may be largely arbitrary and artificial. The same principles are illustrated by the develop- ment of similar organs such as cephalopod and verte- brate eyes. If natural laws can bring about the development of such similar structures as cephalopod and vertebrate eyes without depending upon genetic relationships, the same laws can bring about the same close similarity among organisms. It should not be possible for taxonomists to know how much genetic relationship accounts for similaritv in structure ex- cept for individuals of subspecies and species that interbreed or can interbreed (Dobzhansky 1937). However, the following rule should hold: the more similar organisms are, the greater the probability that their similarity is to be accounted for in part by genetic relationship, especially recent relationship. This probability might amount to 100 per cent for animals that interbreed regularly. For evidences that some taxonomic categories rep- resent artificial concepts in part, see Kinsey (1936) and Huxley (1940). For evidences that evolution tends to occur along straight lines perhaps as often as it tends to continue by branching, see Kinsey (1936), Neumayer &amp; Hyatt (cf., Locy 1908, p. 355), and discussions on ortho- genesis (Eimer, etc., cf., Lull 1929). Ideas similar to those here expressed have appeared in previous writings (Gadow, cf., Jordan &amp; Kellogg 1922, p. 205). The principal fault of the evolution concept that holds prominence is that it does not recognize the possibility that several mechanisms may be about equally important. In other words, most theories that concern evolution have considered one or two principles as important and disregarded others almost entirely. According to one theory, the im- portance of natural selection is overemphasized (Willis 1940, Darwin, cf., Lull 1929). In another, the importance of divergent mutation is exaggerated (Willis 1940) ; whereas the importance of genetic re- lal ionship is underestimated by Gadow. Jordan &amp; Kellogg (1922) strike closely to a middle ground that recognizes the importance of several principles. Taxonomic parallelisms are recognized by Seitz (1930, vol. 14, p. 387). This discussion is an attack upon the dogmatic assumption (1) that evolution of all taxonomic groups depends entirely or almost entirely upon divergence so that genetic relationships may be dia- grammed in the form of a tree, (2) that similarity signifies genetic relationship, especially when taxo- nomic features are not adaptations to environmental influences. There is sufficient reason to believe that when protoplasm reaches a certain age under conditions within definite limitations, specific changes (mutations and gradual variations) tend to take place to lead evolution in one or two or rarely a few (but never an unlimited number) particular directions. This reasoning is based upon (1) a philosophy of "deter- minism" (laws of cause and effect perhaps built partly upon chance in final analysis) supported by what is known of physical and chemical laws as they are known to function, (2) evidences of orthogenesis (Lull 1929 ), (3) the fact that in many instances resemblance between different types of organisms are too perfect to be accounted for by chance or by the benefits of mimicry. See illustrations of similarities between types of butterflies (Punnett 1915). (4) Universal processes. Some processes appear to be occurring throughout groups of organisms independ- ently of close genetic relationship. The primitive condition of spermatophyte and fern leaves is sup- posedly the uncut and simple leaf type. It is easy to observe that simple leaves tend to become com- pound and doubly compound leaves tend to become triply compound (now in the process of occurring in honey locusts), and simple leaves tend to become ser- rated and incut. Papaw, spicebush, and magnolias are among the few plants that have retained a primi- tive condition for the most part. Even some papaw leaves are incut. As a result of the function of natural forces upon molecules and molecular aggregates, parallelism should be a common phenomenon. The extent to which genetic relationship exists between species that comes about through parallelism can probably not be determined; that is to say, there is no criterion for determination to what proportion genetic relation- ship, parallelism, and convergence function in bring- ing about the nature of structures and behavior of species within a genus, genera within a family, etc. However, the higher the category, that is, the greater the total similarity, the greater the probability that genetic relationship is an important factor in account- ing for similarities. The extent that parallelism plays in bringing about similarities among organisms and how much diver- gent evolution plays in bringing about differences cannot be answered without basing judgment upon whether natural changes come about haphazardly or function mainly in accordance with laws. The answer to this question falls upon organic chemistry, physics, and mathematics, at least as much as upon biology.</page><page sequence="49">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 387 The unit of measurement that should serve for judgment of the amnount of difference in structure and behavior that can occur among members within a single species is the amount observable for the sexes of sexually dimorphic species and perhaps also for the alternate generations of metagenetic species and perhaps for those which differ in type in differ- ent seasons. Examples of sexual dimorphism serve as proof for the previous statement. The limitations to structural and behavior variations within species are not rigid and may be scarcely limited. Consider the amount of variation within certain species of moths (Lutz 1918, p. 18), Lernaea, Bonellia (Borra- daile 1923, p. 171, 173), and Coccidae (Comstock 1930, p. 441). Probably the total extent of similarity possible between remotely related species should be as great in magnitude as the amount of difference that can occur within a species. At least, this is re- garded as true according to present taxonomic stand- ards. Structures should not constitute a problem in addition to that of behavior since they come about as a result of the behavior of protoplasm. Conclusion. Divergence, parallelism, and conver- gence all function in accordance with natural laws to determine the nature of structures and behavior. As a result, genetic relationships are likely to be ob- scured in many if not most instances. Taxonomy is as important as ever, but all of the taxonomic cate- gories except individuals-and perhaps species-can- not be regarded as more than artificialities. The one criterion which ecology can recognize to distinguish between species is whether or not members of one type regularly interbreed with another type to pro- duce fertile offspring; that is, human discrimination between species depends upon the species reaction to or recognition of its own kind. This type of re- action is a special kind of coaction. The criterion is acceptable to Dobzhansky (1937). Ideas expressed in this discussion are not in disagreement with those of Goldschmidt (1938, 1940). SIGNIFICANCE OF SYNCHRONIZATION OF ACTIVITIES WITH DAY AND NIGHT Probable advantages of nocturnalism and diurnal- ism have been presented by several authors (Clark 1914, Crawford 1931, 1934, Park 1939, 1940). These advantages are believed to account for natural selec- tion of mechanisms that limit occurrence of activities to appropriate time-communities. Theoretical dis- cussions of this problem have also been given by Vestal (1914), Kennedy (1928), Pearse (1934) and others. A summary of the likely survival value that nocturnal activity has in relation to relative humidity, temperature, and evaporation rate, and other factors has been presented by Park (1939, 1940). Limitation of activities to appropriate time-com- munities may be due to one or more advantages pro- vided by special environmental factor complexes: (1) availability of food [(a) There is much evidence that community activity of predators is greatest dur- ing periods in which their prey is also most active. Such a relation is analogous to the fact that an animal's most important competitors are usually members of its own and closely related species. There are exceptions to the rule (Pearse 1939, p. 499). (b) A theory that has no evidence for support except for few animals holds that predators have adapted themselves to be active in a period during which their prey is at rest and incapable of prevent- ing attack. In both instances, it is held that advan- tages for securement of food are sufficiently great to bring about confinement of predation within appro- priate time-communities characterized by availability of food]. (2) Opportunity for evasion of enemies (Elton 1935, p. 88). Reasoning dictates that noc- turnalism of the crayfish, Cambarus virilis, has come about through natural selection of behavior that leads to avoidance of predators. This species of crayfish is a plant feeder and scavenger, so its nocturnalism cannot be accounted for as an adaptation for secure- ment of food. (3) Opportunity for elimination of competition of other species for food (Vestal 1914) or shelter (Elton 1935, p. 83-84; Willey 1904, cf., Park 1940, p. 500). (4) Availability of illumination that permits the best possible visibility. Most birds of the temperate zones are diurnal in relation to this influence. (5) Opportunity to avoid exposure to h;gh temperatures (Elton 135, p. 88; Pearse 1939, p. 426). (6) Opportunity for removal from air hav- ing a high evaporative power (Park 1938, p. 209). (7) Opportunity for transfer to a secondary host (Elton 1935, p. 87). (8) It is not improbable that a complex of influences already mentioned accounts for the survival value of nocturnalism and diurnalism for many species of animals; for example, both points 5 and 6 are of advantage to certain desert animals. It is worthwhile to give theoretical consideration to certain of the advantages gained by limitation of activities to day and night. What animals are noc- turnal as a consequence of adaptation to times at which food is available and predators are avoidable can be determined only through application of logic to facts secured by observation and experimentation. Sufficient information has not been obtained in order to make application of reasoning to this problem possible for most of the known animal species. It is probable that most North American species of owls became nocturnal as a result of increased availability of prey such as mice that had already become objects of instinctive attack. There are a limited number of environmental influences that de- termine the preservation of tendencies of animals to be active in appropriate time-communities. Such influencts are listed at the beginning of this chapter. Elimination of factors not likely to have influ- enced timing of food securement for owls leaves only points 1 and 2 as possible explanations for development of their nocturnalism. Since owls are as capable of self-defense as most other diurnal birds, and since owls probably have not had any specific or important diurnal enemies, only point 1 remains as a likely explanation for nocturnalism of</page><page sequence="50">388 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 owls. Iowever, it is also possible that adaptation for night vision preceded and determined adoption of nocturnal behaviol. Not much informnatioin has been obtained concern- ing the extenit that carnivorous animals prey upon sleeping or quiescent animals (Elton 1935, p. 83- 100). Behavior of owls illustrates that sleeping and quiescent aniimals are more likely than are active animals to be overlooked by predators (Eaton 1920, part 2, p. 116). The examination of stomach con- tents of many birds by the United States Biological Survey reveals that of seven species of owls studied extensively, only one species-the great horned owl- commonly preys upon sleeping animals. The species studied were: the barn, long-eared, short-eared, barred, saw-wbet, screecb, and great horned owls. The great horned owl normally prevs upon skunks, rabbits, mice, and muskrats. The screech owl feeds upon mice and insects. The food of the saw-whet owl consist almost exclusively of mice and insects. For the remaining species, 60 to 95 per cent of their food consists of mice, and 5 to 12 per cent consists of small birds. The barred owl and other large owls commonly prey upon the saw-whet owl. The barred owl is known to feed commonly upon crayfish, frogs, insects, an(l birds. Concerning the barred owl, Eaton (1920, p. 116) wrote: "I have known repeated in- stances of poultry roosting in the trees of a farmyard where these owls were hooting every night about the place without a single fowl being disturbed. About 16 per cent of their food consisted of birds. The remaining proportion consisted of mice." Similar information is available for most species of Herodi- ones and Caprimulgidae (Eaton 1920). The Strig- idae, some of the Ardeidae, and Caprimulgidae comprise almost all of the North American birds that are active at a time when feeding upon sleeping diurnal animals would be possible. Predatioin of most animals is limited to the nych- themeral period in which prey is most active. Take for example: predation by flycatchers, most feeding for the majority of warblers, wrens, shrikes, hawks, owls, eagles, herons, gulls, goatsuckers, kingfishers, mice, shrews, skunks, bats, and most predation for members of the Canidae, Felidae, and Ursidae (ref- erences: treatises on special taxonomic groups, nat- ural histories, United Sates Government Farmers Bulletins, United States Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service, and Wild Life Review). Florsheim (1906) states that diurnal forms are in a less alert condition at night "at which time they are quite available to nocturnal predators." Clark (1914) holds that nocturnal predaceous mammals and birds take prey when least capable of defense, ini fact, "owe their nightly activity to such an ecological arrangement." These views have not been attacked. The total evidences that the writer has found to sup- port these assumptions are as follows. A few species of animals uncover and prey upon animals that are sheltered from most possible predators. The pro- portion of North American animals that have such specialized tendencies for securement of food can be listed in little space, and it is obvious that these ani- mals constitute a very srnall proportion of the total number of species and individuals. An attempt is mnade to mention taxonomic groups that cover all species that possess such tendencies. Most examples include species that occur in North America. Preda- tors that usually uncover animals while the latter are concealed in niches include: sandpipers, turn- stones, towhees, oyster catchers, badgers, hogs, ant- eaters (Edentata), aard varks, brown creepers, most woodpeckers, nuthatches, titmice, and some species of snakes. The tendency of robins to uncover earth- worms falls into this category. Squirrels, snakes, jays, and crows occasionally rob bird nests of eggs and young. Many carnivores attack poultry and stock while they are resting. Carnivores known to prey upon poultry or other farm or ranch animals in- clude: the puma, the lynx and wild cat, leopards, tigers, lions, foxes, wolves, weasels, and hawks. Coy- otes and wolves usually do not attack poultry or stock except during periods in which food is scarce as in winter. The extent that most carnivores prey upon sleeping animals especially in the wild has not been discovered. Confinement and domestication have placed domestic animals at a disadvantage so far as vigor in fighting and possibility of escape from enemies is concerned; and, unless it can be shown that animals which attack sleeping farm animals also make similar attacks upon wild species, such a food relationship has little ecological significance. Change from either diurnalism or arhythmicity to nocturnalism should not always be a successful means of escape from predators. It appears that specific predators can occasionally adapt their own time for activity to time of activity of their original prey in part as a consequence of increase in sensitivity of certain of their sense organs as evolution progresses. On the other hand, as species become nocturnal, their predators do not always adopt special nocturnal adaptations sufficiently effective to make nocturnal hunting of original food possible. The difficulty in- volved in development of organs that are hypersen- sitive to particular types of stimuli may be respon- sible for retention of diurnalism for many carnivores such as hawks. Hypersensitive senses referred to include: hypersensitivity to light such as occurs for owls (Vanderplanck 1934, cf., Park 1940, Dice 1942, personal communication) and most members of the Felidae, hypersensitivity to sound-producing vibra- tions as occurs for bats (Griffin &amp; Galambos 1940), and hypersensitivity of the olfactory sense as devel- oped in many members of the Canidae including blood hounds. It is believed that all of the carnivores including the Canidae also rely upon sight in order to capture their prey. Personal observationis indicate that night-jars rely upon sight for capture of food and that bats may rely partly upon vision for the same function. Evidently, sight has become useless only for subterranean animals such as moles, cave</page><page sequence="51">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 389 animals, and for most of those animals that live in the deep sea (Pearse 1938, Hesse 1937). It follows that most vertebrates whether nocturnal or diurnal-rely upoIn sight for securement of food. It appears to be evident also that nocturnal predators are usually attiracted by motion of prey instead of the latter's color and shape. Motion also tends to be the important factor that attracts diurnal predators (Borradaile 1923, p. 87). Protective coloration may also be of assistance even to animals that are exposed at night (Verrill 1897, cf., Park 1940). After preda- tors are attracted to moving objects that represent possible food, the prey is followed or forgotten ac- cording to whether or riot its size, form, and color are in accord with what represents food to a species -as determniiied by instinct or past experience of particular individuals. These considerations make it apparent why miiany diurnal animals have little need of protective resemblance to surroundings. Vestal (1914) suggests that there are several types of characters to which animals may become adapted "so as to be removed from competition for food . . . one of which is biographical-permitting adaptation of life eveles to favorable seasons, feeding to par- ticular timnes of day, etc." Pearse (1934) looks upon such an idea with approval. Elton (1927) and Park (19.31, p. 709, 1937, p. 16) indicate that nocturnal and diurnal faunas constitute associations ("com- munities") that are quite separate from each other. Nocturnalism is probably iio more often an adapta- tion to securement of food than it is an adaptation for escape from predators and other detrimental in- fluences. Darwin's logic concerning survival of the fittest animals involves both struggle for food and struggle againist being eaten. So far as has been de- termined, both of these factors are equally important in guidance of evolutionary trends. In most instances diuriialism is iiiore likelv to be an adaptation for securemeiit of food than an adaptation for escape from predators, since diurnal predation does not re- quire as great a specialization of sense organs of predators as is required by nocturnal predation. That nocturnal animals may adopt diurnalism should be possible; however, no instances of secondary turn to diurnalisin are deflnitely known. THE PROBLEMI OF PROTECTIVE COLORATION AND FORM The fact that most male birds and butterflies are brilliantlv colored is not to the disadvantage of their species, because during their period of greatest activity, if one of a species is to be taken by a predator, it will more likely be a male than a female. The disadvantage of brilliant color to male birds is riot so great that they cannot usually hold their own long enough to take part in reproducing their kind. Birds obtaiii protection by being alert, by employing the partial tonic immobility meehanism during first indications of danger, by communicating a call to others that results in quiescence and in part, by maintaining a sufficiently high reproductive rate for their species to outlive misfortunes of individuals. Conspicuousness of diurnal animals cannot be used as an argument against protectiveness of "concealing coloration and form." The important point to re- member is that the nocturnal animals which do not tend to conceal themselves by taking to shelter are protected by concealing coloration during the day, that is, during the sleeping period when they would not be very capable of self-defense if attacked by larger predators. According to the writer's knowl- edge, not a single nocturnal moth, nocturnal bird, or nocturnal mammal shows conspicuous coloration while in its resting poise during the day, and the relatively few conspicuously colored nocturnal ani- mals such as certain salamanders and lizards obtain concealment under shelter during the daylight period. Exceptions such as the gila monster are few; they are poisonous, or are adapted for protection in some other manner. It is worth reniembering that the only brilliantly colored moths (Catocala sp., Uran- iidae, Zygaenidae, and similar species, Seitz 1930) are diurnal fliers and rest in such a manner as to cover their brilliant colors. Fishes can afford to be brilliantly colored in part because their visual sense does not become useless during the day. Most con- spicuous fishes live in a brilliantly colored environ- ment such as is offered by coral reefs, or are poison- ous, or remain motionless among stones most of the day. Examples of the latter type have special struc- tural adaptations for living in rapid currents. Evidence has been offered in a previous chapter that nocturnal animals ordinarily do not attack rest- ing prey. Other evidences indicate that most diurnal animals with the exception of several already men- tioned do not commonly attack nocturnal animals. Very few species are known to uncover animals that are under shelters. These have been listed. Of those animals that are exposed during the dav while at rest, most are protectively colored and none are brightly colored. Of those day-quiescent animals that are not protectively colored, other protective mech- anisms that are of less common occurrence for many groups of animals replace protective resemblance and serve as its equivalent. There is no evidence in ecolog- ical literature to indicate that any animals which appear to have a well-developed resemblance to their surroundings in conjunction with quiescence are preyed upon except possibly in rare instances. On the other hand, there is much experimental evidence that animals which are colored or both colored and formed like their natural surroundings are seldom attacked by predators when both protectively colored and more conspicuous foods are available at the same time (Pearse 1939, p. 21, Cott 1940). It is probable that nocturnal animals are protected during the day from diurnal predators by being protectively colored and shaped or by being concealed under shelters to about the same degree on the whole that diurnal forms are concealed at night from nocturnal predators as a result of reduced light intensity. The extent that</page><page sequence="52">390 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Vol.g12, no.a4 Vol. 12, No. 4 nocturnal and diurnal communities are protected from each other balances and illustrates one of the "balances of nature." IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING TYPES OF BEHAVIOR IMPORTANCE OF ACTIVITY CLASSIFICATIONS TO STUDENTS OF BEHAVIOR A comprehensive classification of behavior should provide a synopsis of all activities. Books on "Ani- mal Behavior" that have appeared thus far do not cover all of the available categories of importance that pertain to the field treated, so their titles are misleading. Some treatises entitled "Psychology" do not limit their analysis of behavior to activities that involve mental phenomena. They are valuable to students of physiology and behavior but tend to be overlooked by students who are particularly inter- ested in the behavior of lower organisms. General treatises on behavior have not indicated what topics they omit from consideration so as to indicate what remains to be determined through new experimenta- tions or by dependence upon separate writings al- ready published. In general treatises on anmal behavior, topics cov- ered are usually fragmentarv, and many topics essen- tial to comprehensive knowledge are omitted. An exception to this rule is offered bv Warden, Jenkins &amp; Warner (1935, 1936, 1940). General treatises as a rule do not present several ecological aspects of behavior, whereas there are at least eleven important standpoints that serve as a hasis for comparison and evaluation of ecological activities. Comprehensive ecological texts tend to treat be- havior incidentally. Thev distribute considerations of behavior among such topics as autecology, syne- cology, d-stribution, and parasitology, so that organ- izationl of activtes is not apparent. Such a plan of organization is essential for the presentation of gen- eral ecologv, and a recognition of this feature of general ecology is not a criticism. Classification outlines of many categories of be- havior have beenl presented. Examples are offered by the following: adaptations (Galloway 1913); tropisms (Loeb 1918; Fraenkel &amp; G-unn 1940); group activities aInd biotic activities that concern food and shelter relationships (Allee 1931, 1938) ; timing of activities (Park 1937); reactions or responses (Loeb 1918; Shelford 1913, 1914b; Warden, Jenkins &amp; Warner 1935-1940; Kiihn cf., Fraenkel &amp; Gunn 1940); and bird migrations (Peterson 1940-1941). Other references to original classifications are made in connection with Behavior of Organisms. Most of the condensed classifications of particular classes of behavior offered to date omit important topics or are too fragmentary to be very useful to students of behavior. It mav not be clear to students that such treatises as "Orientation of Animals" (Fraenkel &amp; Gunn 1940) omit certain aspects of orientation unless reference is made either to a comprehensive classification of activity or to special reviews. Topics not covered by Fraenkel &amp; Gunn have been mentioned by Allee (1941). "Failure to recognize the relative importance of the different activities is in part responsible for the general unorganized state of our knowledge" (Shel- ford 1937, p. 32). When behavior categories are subdivided, different adaptations that meet similar ends may be compared in such a manner as to illustrate parallelism, con- vergence, and adaptive radiation. Primitive types of activities that exist at present for some organisms often represent stages through which other activities are reached by way of evolution. A classification of behavior shows that many physiological phenomena are e(uivalent to and perfectly comparable with dynaniic behavior of other organisnis. Growth and many other passive or automatic physiological proc- esses belong to the field of behavior in many instances. A classification clarifies concepts. In the preface of Fraenkel &amp; Gunn (1940) the authors state that "the object of this book is to give an account of those reactions of animals which used to be called tropisms." There is no reason to drop the term tropism. The fact that Fraenkel &amp; Gunn make such a statement indicates that there is unwarranted con- fusion riot only in terminology but in the concrete- ness of concepts. It is unfortunate that confusion exists in regard to the meanings of some important terms sueh as instinct and tropism. The variety of meanings at- tributed to these words is beyond justification. In- stinct and tropism can change in meaning within definite limits only. Their elimination only creates necessity for other new terms to replace them. Un- necessary introduction of new terms does not help the concept situation since all new terms that can be defined only by complex qualifications (see glos- sary) are likely to go through stages of misunder- standing arid consequent misuse. It is necessary that the significance of terms be illustrated and explained in order to prevent further delusion and uncertainty in the understanding of the important concepts they represent. Misuse of terms indicates that important concepts have not been formed that should be a part of common knowledge. Some authors have held that physico-chemical laws cannot explain those actions which are guided by desires. As a result, Loeb has received undeserved criticism. Careless thinking that results in unfair criticism ought to be pointed out when possible-in part-to safeguard thought proc- esses of students. A classification of activities provides opportunities to mention misunderstandings that have developed coiicernin- the functions of structures such as the opinion that Paramecium is-to some extent-pro- tected from Didinium by means of trichocysts. It is possible to permit a view of many aspects of a subject to be perplexing. This point may be illus-</page><page sequence="53">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 391 trated by structure as well as behavior. In some instances taxonomy must rely upon the criterion of wing venation or structure of genitalia. In other instances the nature of wing venation or structure of genitalia cannot serve in the least to show rela- tionships. Size, shape, color, length, and width of structures and of whole organisms, behavior, and physiological characteristics are important to various extents according to the type of organism that is to be classified. If one attempts to learn all of the vari- ous criteria that taxonomists employ to classify or- ganisms, taxonomy itself appears to be in a muddle. Nevertheless, various criteria are important in making taxonomic evaluations and are essential to the clari- fication of taxonomic relationships (Huxley 1940). All of the points in a comprehensive classification of behavior cannot be used to classify the activities of all organisms because many organisms do not possess particular features of action. This is com- parable to the fact that all points that may possibly apply to the taxonomy of organisms cannot apply to all types of organisms. Naturally, responses to images are not involved in the behavior of protozoa. By analogy, the criterion of wing venation cannot be applied to the taxonomy of sponges. The same combination of criteria cannot usually be employed to evaluate the behavior of different kinds of organisms. Behavior of some organisms may be analyzed in greater detail than the behavior of other organisms as a result of differences in complexity. By analogy, the possibilities of considering different structures for taxonomic classification of species and genera of amoebae are far less than the possibilities for con- sidering the differences of structure among species and genera of crayfishes. All activities do not have equivalents. Some tax- onomic categories for particular groups of organisms are not subdivided at present. For example, some orders are not divisible into families. They do not need to be subdivided unless new equivalent types of organisms are discovered. By analogy, some tvpes of activities do not lend themselves to subdivision at present. The original and fundamental problem of adapta- tion is borne by protoplasm-not by organisms. Or- ganisms are units of matter that represent protoplasm in the various forms that it may take. Protoplasm has become adapted to catch food by forming valves in some forms such as pitcher plants and by forming trap mechanisms that function as a consequence of rapid movement in certain other or- ganisms. Both types of adaptations are brought about via movement that is, dynamic behavior-of protoplasm. Rapid dynamic movements of parts of organisms represent a type of behavior that is on a higher level of evolutionary advancement than em- bryonic and post-embryonic growth and differentia- tion movements. Weiss (1939) has made it clear that post-embryonic growth and differentiation move- ments are not essentially different from growth and differentiation movements of embryos. He has also emphasized that embryonic and post-embryonic growth and differentiation movements are regulated by responses to stimuli and by endogenous influences that also serve as regulators of more rapid dynamic behavior of whole organisms. A strict line of separa- tion cannot be drawn between behavior and embry- ology or physiology. In this outline an attempt is made to restrict behavior principally to post- embryonic activities and to those movements that have a direct relation to the external environment. This treatise could be properly entitled: Ecological Classification of the Dynamic Behavior of Proto- plasm. The term Protoplasm may be replaced by Organisms since organisms represent protoplasm. Summary: It is better to have a fairly compre- hensive condensed classification of activities available to students of behavior than to have none. An ex- cellent classification should come eventually. The outline entitled Behavior of Organisms is in the proc- ess of expansion. To produce work that brings criticism stimulates both thinking and investigation that in turn bring about improvement of that which is attacked. This is one aim of publication. A general survey of available knowledge of animal activities can be summarized and organized in a manner that encourages comparison of activities that serve the same purposes or needs. To attempt to grasp the whole of animal behavior by covering most of the important treatises on animal behavior leaves comprehension of the subject in an uiiorganized state. A classification places knowledge on a scientific level. One of the important functions of science is the organizing of knowledge. It is not implied that general treatises should cover every possible topic in detail. However, literary works on behavior should state what topics are not covered by their titles when the latter do not accu- rately designate what material is treated The scien- tific attitude dictates that titles should not refer to more than what is covered. When it is pointed out that certain aspects of behavior are scarcely treated in the literature, it becomes apparent what fields offer the greatest opportunities for research. IMPORTANCE OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIEs THAT ARE OBSERVED OR RECORDED The time-distribution of relative degrees of qui- escence and general activity through day and night usually has purely physiological significance. Many animals are active in some way or another through a considerable portion of both day and night. Sleep is a type of activity (restful activity) and for some animals involves sleep movements, which indicates that mere movement is not of ecological significance. This point is illustrated by fishes and humans. Time-records of nychthemeral or seasonal move- ments are not ecologically significant except when such facts as the following are determined: (1) Nor- mal place or places in which activity occurs, that is,</page><page sequence="54">392 TILDENW. ROBERTS Ecological Moinographs Vol. 12, No. 4 nature of the environment in which movement takes place; (2) adaptive accomplishments of particular types of movements; (3) nature of movement; whether accomplished passively or actively, and whether accomplished by means of appendages or other mechanisms. Community activity involves procurement of food and exposure to enemies and is correlated with move- ment of animals through their habitats. Therefore, for purposes of measurement-when opportunity for distractions that might influence reproductive or parental tendencies is eliminated-community activity can be represented by locomotion outside of niches for animals that do not wait for food to come to them. It is to be expected that the usual degree of over- lap should exist between communitv and species activity as normally lies between synecology and autecology. Reproductive activity includes courtship and breeding behavior and consists largely of species activity. When birds obtain food for their young, community activity is involved and family activities may alternate with or be superimposed upon com- munity activities. In all instances, special recording devices and direct observation are useful in discov- ering the nature of individualistic, family, and com- munity activities and in separating activities as to types. By comparing locomotor activity curves of an animal when solitary and when paired both in and out of the breeding season, and subtracting differ- ences, a curve of locomotor activity having to do with courtship and breeding can be derived. Apparatus has been used successfully in the field to record reproductive and community activities (references noted below in connection with technical difficulties). Personal or individualistic behavior includes sleep and semi-sleep movements, movements involved in body cleaning, preening in birds, and spontaneous use of sound organs. It is not desirable to allow the latter type of activity to be registered as loco- motor activity, nor to confuse the two in a general activity curve. Activity curves are not comparable on a similar basis when dependent upon criteria be- longing to different classes of behavior. The occurrence of a discrepancy as a result of using an autecological behavior trait for measuring community activity is illustrated by the following examples based upon personal observations. Mock- ingbirds often sing through most of moonlight nights. During late April and during May (Urbana, Illinois) robins commonly sing from 2 :30 A.M. until shortly after sunrise. Their singing through the day is gen- erally limited to brief or intermittent periods and usually is prominent during evenings. Rainy days bring about modified behavior and are not considered in connection with ordinary activity. The robin's call notes are prominent at twilight and are often associated with a group activity such as flocking. These facts do not indicate that the nocturnal activity of mockingbirds and robins has any significance ex- cept as an autecological behavior trait. Ornithologists continue to regard these birds as being almost entirely confined to the diurnal time-community even though records of song and call notes through the day-night cycle would often show their activity to be predomi- nantly crepuscular or/and nocturnal. Their voice curve does not correspond to their locomotor curve as we know it to be, and it becomes evident that the time at which sound is produced by special organs of animals does not indicate the time at which their community activity occurs except when sound pro- duction can be shown for specific instances to be asso- ciated with activities of other community meinbers. Crayfishes often move about in their seclusion niches and clean various parts of their structure dur- ing the day. They lose their nychthemeral locomotor rhythm while mating. These individualistic and breeding behavior characteristics do not alter the fact that the activities of the virilis crayfish that concern its relationship to various members of the community occur almost completely within the noc- turnal period. Some species of animals become predominantly nocturnal temporarily for breeding activities in a way that is analogous to temporary terrestrialism of sea turtles during periods of oviposition. For the adults of some species, for example, may-flies and mouthless moths, activity is restricted entirelv to the nocturnal period for reproductive functions onlv. In certain species of turtles, community activity mav be mainly diurnal, but activities that have to do with oviposition are nocturnal. It appears that for some species of animals, only one of the reproductive activities occurs under the nocturnal realm while other activities except purely physiological processes occur during the day or during both day and night. It is not unlikelv that the reproductive drive will prove to be an important factor responsible for pro- nounced nocturnalism in some kinds of animals and for temporary increase in diurnalism of others as holds for most crayfishes during mating. Feeding at night may be a secondary and temporary phenomenon that secondarily accompanies a special time for repro- ductive activity among some kinds of animals such as most sphynx moths. Feeding is limited to a con- siderable extent to their larval period. Therefore, consideration of time of feeding for manv species must involve the larval stages. A pond at 1003 West Nevada Street, IUrbana, provided personal opportunities to observe activities of toads during a period of two years. Casual ob- servations suggest that locomotor and calling activ- ities of male toads are not predom;nantly nocturnal before or after the breeding season. Nor is bodily activity restricted to night during the breeding season as has been well shown through carefully conducted research (Higginbotham 1939). Also, in a number of instances, males were heard to sing through the morning until after noon and again before sunset. Only adults came to water (all of the males copulated when offered mates and all of the females laid fertile eggs) .</page><page sequence="55">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 393 Three toads were observed to eat ants while ex- posed to the full rays of the sun at midday in middle July, 1940. During dry periods in summer, the toads covered themselves with soil and usually remained in it at night as well as during the day. A long white string attached to a hind leg of each individual per- mitted their positions to be noted. Night proved to be perhaps no inore important than moisture (and perhaps other factors) in regulating time of activity. The toads would rernain in the soil through many dry days and nights and emerge during rains whether rain fell during day or night. Preponderance of noc- turnal activity was not to be observed before or after the breeding season. Usually, the toads moved about in the evening only until they secured an aquatic habitat. The females remained quiet after reaching water. The only activity of males was singing unless a female was noticed. When a female was observed, it was pursued. During mating, nychthemeral rhyth- mic tendencies were reduced or lost. Copulation continued during both night and day-mostly in water, but also continued for copulating pairs when they were placed in terrestrial niches. Two points deserve emphasis. (1) Vocal utterance is more likely to be concerned with autecological activity reproductive activity in particular than with community activity, probably rarely with the latter as should be possible in instances characterized by associations of different species for mutual or co- operative interests. For example, sounds made by some species may have value to other species for such partnerships as occur between ostriches and zebras; giraffes and elephants (Roosevelt &amp; Heller 1914; Borradaile 1923, p. 109; Allee 1931, p. 30). Evidence that vocal utterances excite the attention of predators is probably meager if it exists in any quantity. Direct observation of time of feeding shows that an animal's taking of food its principal community activity-tends to occur independently of vocal activity and may occur in a different time period than that in which vocal utterances are promi- nent. (2) It is important to be concerned with the ecological ilature of immature animals at least as much as with inature individuals, because at any given time most communities usually consist of more immature individuals than adults (Darwin's evidence of overproduction). Analysis of activity of imma- ture individuals and adults when not studied during the breeding period should-on the whole contribute a worthwhile picture to a knowledge of the synecology of various species. Probably, this information would come neaIrer to representing truth than the knowl- edge which can be derived from studies of adult activity alone when recordings are based largely upon activities directly or indirectly associated with reproduction; since, in the behavior of the immature, the reproductive influence is ruled out. For the pic- ture to be complete, activity of adults during the breeding per od would need to be studied also. It should be kept in mind that the significance of an animal's activity varies according to whether it is viewed from an autecological or synecological viewpoint. The only consequence to the flight of Saturniid moths and May-flies so far as species adaptation is concerned is the finding of mates and laying of eggs in a suitable habitat. Their activity centers entirely around reproduction (reproductive activity). A drive for food has been eliminated from the behavior of adults. However, from the stand- point of the community, such aiiimals are to be in- cluded with the wheels turning in the community machine, since their flight excites attack by nocturnal predators to a greater extent than does quiescence. A classification of activities includes the following possibilities. So far as the autecology of a species is concerned, certain activities may involve or tend to influeilce other species in communities (community activity) or may be dependent upon its own species only (species behavior). Certain activities of an individual may pertain to itself only (individualistic behavior). So far as synecology is concerned, animals may take part actively or passively in community dynam- ics, or they may be excluded from the influences of the dvnamic activities of other community members. Exclusion does not tend to apply to complete life histories of any species. It usually holds only for particular life stages of particular species such as wood-boring lepidoptera. The extent of exclusion varies amoing different species since animals may be entirely exposed to community dynamics, or they may be more or less successfully hidden from predators by retreat or by possession of both protective colora- tion and a tendency to remain motionless, or by restricting exposure during rest to night when natural light intensity is reduced to its minimum intensity. Apparatus can be relied upon to automatically record the time at which a f ew principal types of activity such as locomotion, rest, incubation and feed- ing occur for a great variety of animals when ap- propriate controls are employed. It serves to eliminate error in analysis of activity when each type of activity is measured and studied as separately as possible from every other type. After different kinds of behavior have been studied as to their particular time of occurrence, it becomes possible to discover what relation each activity has to other types. After different activities are studied, an attempt to determine interrelatioinships between different kinds should be attempted. One result should be an understanding of how different activities are integrated. To observe, measure, and summarize at random all of the activities that can be observed gives un- organized accounts of behavior. DISCREPANCIES ENCOUNTERED IN DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF ACTIVITIES DISCREPANCIES CAIUSED BY THE Low RATE OF SPEED OF 24-HOUR KYMOGRAPH DR.UMS WHEN USED IN CONNECTION WITH DIRECT RECORDERS Certain linitatioiis in direct methods of measuring activity and discrepancies that teild to occur on 24-</page><page sequence="56">394 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monograplhs Vol. 12, No. 4 hour kymograph drums have been mentioned (Stew- art 1898, Roberts 1940, Spoor 1941). During periods of an animal's activity, opportunity is offered for overlapping of activity marks whether rate of locomotion is constant or not. Rate of loco- motion is regarded as constant for accurate judgment of error since the important concern is with theoret- ical possibilities of error in method while all variables are constant except time at which activity occurs. I can be observed that as a result of overlapping of activity record marks ("units") opportunity for errors of over 90 per cent are offered by the 24-hour kymograph for any quarter of a minute or for peri- ods of longer duration. The same degree of error is possible when amount of diurnal activity is compared with that of a nocturnal period (Figs. 11, 12, 14, and 15). 3:15 3:11? 9 1 A 3 -(X) 3 -3 3364 (150) 420 (420) 15:15 15:15 4 124 (150) 28 (26) A B FIG. 11.

The fractions not enclosed in parentheses are the proportions of an inch that should be represented on the reeord for the time eovered (15 seeonds). The fractions in parentheses are the actual proportions of an inch consumed, as shown on the record by markers. The diserepancy is due to the minimum size of markers, and is eliminated by providing record- ing paper at a relatively rapid rate as illustrated in B. A. As registered on the 24-hour kymograph drum mov- ing reeording paper at a rate of 1.07 inches per hour. B. As registered on the chronograph providing 81/4 to 81/2 inches of recording paper per hour. In section B, there are three examples taken from an infinite number of possibilities. The horizontal distance covered by a marker per hour on a conventional drum is about 1.07 inches. Practically 1/3364 of an inch is covered per second. 1/3364 of an inch is about twenty times narrower than the finest line that can be drawn distinctly by practical markers. 150 lines to the inch requires a clear space on each side of each line, or a total of 301 spaces per inch. The same limitation is encoun- tered in printing. A fine photographic print is com- monly made according to a 150 screen. It is concluded that although the maximum number of distinct lines that can be drawn by a marker is from 150 to 200 to the inch, the number of activity "units" represented for the same period can amount to at least several hundred. This conclusion is supported by experi- mentation with fine marking pens, pencils, and wax S C A L E (.27 inches) A B4 B (one fourth hr.) FIG. 12.

Siniee for direct recordinigs, a horizontal mark represenits no activity, it is appropriate to count as activity marks those which diverge definitely from the horizontal plane and those which reverse their vertical slant. It follows that an overlap is not necessarily a retrace since amount of error (over- lapping) following an unrecorded rest period (which should show as a horizontal line) is the same whether an activity record mark continues to be made up- wards or downwards in reference to its previous posi- tion (Fig. 13). 3 L -16 R -1 L --2 R --1 L -16 K --I L I_ 4Fufbl e @tratongt OR --2 L apparent I L SL -i L 15 FIG. 13A.

(This is an error of 471%. 17 - 9 - 8; 17 . 8 - 2.125; 100 . 2.12 = 47). This error is due in part to overlapping of units anid is illustrated graplh- ically in Figure 5 for the period from 5:00-6:00 P.M. The principle outline(d has been realized by phys- iologists since Ludwig and his associates employed the kymograph in physiological experiments. It is presented here only because its importance has been overlooked in many animal behavior studies. Stated briefly, the principle is that a kymograph record is false as long as an increased rate of supplying recording paper would change relative values of record marks; while, of course, rate of supplying paper is constanit for each experiment (Fig. 11). ERRORS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIRECT METHODS, ESPECIAL,LY WHEN EMPLOYED IN CONNECTION WITH A 24-HOUR KYMOGRAPH DRUM 1. Activity record marks usually represent unequal values. In order to better understand values of vertical or slanting recording lever marks of different lengths, one may investigate rates of locomotion of the ani- mal being studied, perhaps only to find that as for a cravfish, average rate of locomotion is ordinarily practically the same whenever it takes place at a defi- nite temperature. Apparent difference in rate is ofteni in proportion to the extent locomotion is inter- rupted by rest periods for the crayfish, Camlbarus ririlis Hagen (Fig. 13). However, this is beside the point. It is important whether marks would be equivalent in value providing rate of locomotion is constant. If rate is constant, differences in length of vertical or slanting marks are not of qualitative record taken by the "direct" lever method. record taken by the Indirect, unit method. 16 6.14 12 10 A 94 .4 N2 6 8 10 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 2 4 6 A.M.

Activity curves of Cam.barus virilis Hagen, one based upon a recor(l produced by the activity unit ietliod used in connection with a chronograplh that pro- vided eight inches of recordinig paper per hour, the other based upon a record iiiade by means of the lever method usedl in connection with a kymograph that provided one and one-fourth inches of paper per hour. Both records were pr oduced simultaneously by the same individual. The direct method indicates that only 90 per cent of all activity is nocturnal, while the indirect (electrical) method shows that practically 100 per cent of activity occurs at night. The hour in whieh darkness falls and the hours of darkness are considered nocturnal. Assume that the direct method indicates an animal's activity to be 80 per cent nocturnal. This should mean that the aiiiount of activity which occurs at night is four times greater than that which occurs during the day (80/20; 4/1). Assume that the activity unit method in connection with the relatively rapid chr oniograph inidicates activity of the same animilal to be 90 per cent niocturnial. This would iiaean that the nocturnal activity is niine times greater than that which occurs durimlg the day (90/10; 9/1). 90 per cenit would be practically correct, and the extent of error can be deter mined by comiiparing the in- corr ect ratio of activity to the correct ratio. The approximnate error obtaiiied through the direct method is 55 per cent (9 - 4 - 5; 9 --- 5 - 1.8 100 - 1.8 -_ 55.5). Based upon Table 2. significance, that is, do not indicate rate of action but are quantitative in proportion to amount of loco- motion and duration of time in which such locomotion occurred. The greater the vertical or horizontal space covered by vertical or slanting activity marks, the greater the duration of activity that is repre- sented (Fig. 12). Rate of locomotion is indicated only by degree of slant of activity marks; the nearer the mark is to being vertical, the more rapid the motion; the slower the movement of an animal, the nearer will the activ- ity mark be oni the horizontal plane that represents inactivity. This criterion is the only one that indi- cates rate of motion. The error in evaluating activity marks which are iiot equivaleit in length is reduced by use of a relatively rapid chronograph, especially when the sum of activity periods as measured by proportion of kymograph record space covered by slanting lines -is compared to the sum of rest periods-as meas-</page><page sequence="58">396 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs4 ured according to proportion of space covered by horizontal lines and the comparison evaluated as a ratio or per cent. Illustration: if the total horizontal space covered by horizontal lines per 1.07 inches per hour amounts to 0.535 inches and the horizontal space covered by slanting lines totals 0.535 inches, the activity for this hour represents 50 per cent of the amount of activity which would be possible for any hour and would be tabulated as 50. To make such determinations requires careful measurements. The task is time consuming and for this reason is prob- ably not practical, although far more accurate than is the method of attempting to translate directly recorded activity marks into activity "units." It is voncluded that for direct recordings, vertical or slant- ing activity marks are generally not equivalent to each other, regardless of the rate at which the kymo- graph paper is provided (Fig. 12). The questions are sometimes asked: (1) "Is it nec- essary and desirable to determine activity curves to a high degree of accuracy, since they generally vary for each individual from day to day and among indi- viduals of the same species?" (2) "Is it necessary or preferable to analyze for cornparison activity periods of less duration than an hour?" "Do not comparisons of hours of activity to hours of inactiv- ity satisfy requir ements of significant knowledge ?" These questions can be answered as follows: (1) It is not so important to determine activity curves to exact accuracy as to admit in every research the amount of error permitted by methods of measuring activity when and where considerable degree of error occurs. It is necessary to be reasonably accurate in order that the results be in the least significant. To illustrate: if an activity curve shows 60 per cent tiocturnality, and the amount of error offered by method of measuremenit amounts to 18 per cent, it is within a reasonable possibility of error that the activity is actually arhythmic or predominantly di- urnal. (2) For the purpose of accuracy in deriving nychthemeral activity curves, it is necessary to ana- lyze an animal's activity within every hour and finally to every minute and fraction of every minute of day and night. This would not be necessary if the activ- ity of animals occurred entirely within one period, that is, either day or night (so far as determination of percentage nocturnal activity is concerned), and it is not necessary for determining whether animals are to sonie extent active during day or night, or (luring the various hours. However, if one's interest were confinied to what hours species are active and inactive, such information could best be shown by a check system, the hours in which activity occurs merely being checked so as to contrast them with hours in which activity does not occur. It is neces- sary to determine the percentage of an animal's activity that occurs during each hour of day arid night in detail so far as is possible in order to deter- mine the relative distribution of activity and qui- escence through day and night. Accurate results can be secured only by determining the proportion of total duration of activity as compared to total dura- tion of rest periods for night in contrast to the pro- portions of activity and rest during the day. The proportion of activity which occurs during the night may be compared to the total as percentage nocturnal activity. The importance of such percent- ages has been well explained (Park 1937, 1940, 1941, and other references listed in his bibliographies). This type of result is significant from ecological as well as physiological standpoints as illustrated by the following example. If all animal were active on the average onie second out of every fifteen during the day, and ten seconds out of every fiften during the night, it would be tell times more active at night than durinig the day. This difference probably ha-, ecological significance. It indicates that the animal's community influence and conitact should be corre- spondingly greater at night. It infers that a corre- spondingly greater amount of area is covered by the animal at night, accompanied by a greater amount of food encounitered and an increase in number of enemies attracted as a result of the animal's motion. It should be emphasized that although ecologists are interested in knowinig such differences in proportion of activity (as illustrated above), such differences in distribution of activity are not revealed on the 24- hour kymograph drum when used in connection with direct marking levers or cage movements. This is because all space of the record would be completely filled with activity marks and the record would ap- pear to represenit arhythmic activity. The errors in this inistance amounit to zero for the diurnal part of the record, and ninie tenths of the correct value (90 per cent) for the nocturnal part of the record. 2. Seclusion niiche activity is not distinguishable from community activity. Activity in seclusion niches registers as equivalent to commnulnity activity when activity is recorded by means of levers attached directly to animals or when activity is recorded omily by suspended cage move- ments.

The occurrence of this error is illustrated for the crayfish, Cambaruts virilis Hagen in Figures 4 and 5. Such an error would not tend to occur for animals that are generally seden- tary, for example, ant-lion larvae; nor for animals that do not rernain in limited, secluded areas during periods of comparative rest; nor for those animals that remain inotionless during their periods of least activity. This problem has been solved through dif- ferent means for various animals (references noted below in connection with technical difficulties). For crayfish, activity unit switches have been used to regulate magnetic recorders. Activity units are reg- istered on chronograph paper that moves sufficiently rapidly to prevent overlapping of marks (Roberts 1940, 1941). Activity of an animal while in its seclusion niche may or may not be registered accord- ing to the way the apparatus is adjusted to possible positions that animal may take. For experiments upon which Figures 4 and 5 are based, apparatus was so adjusted that activity was not registered for animals while they were in seclusion niches. It is considered that a correct distribution of community activity is shown by activity-unit methods. Observe the general amount of error according to individual hours (on the average) as shown graphically in Fig. 15. The exaggeration of activity during the day in the direct method is due to recording of activity while the animal is in its niche; underrated activity at night in the direct method is the result of over- lapping of units, since overlapped units do not show for counting. Refer to Figs. 14 and 15. UNNATUIRALNESS OF ENVIRONMENT AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF DISCREPANCY When studying animals, it is important that they be exposed to the total complex of environmental influences to which they are normally subjected in their natural environments. This point has been ex- plained by Shelford (1934). It is widely recognized that but few animals on a psychological level as high as that of birds are likely to regulate their feeding and other activities nor- mally when transferred from their natural environ- ment to ordinary laboratory conditions. Such ani- mals must usually be subjected to laboratory condi- tions for a long period or be reared in captivity, sometimes for more than one generation, before activ- ities are likely to be regulated to occur at normal times. Activity records of toads have been made in this laboratory, direct observation and unit apparatus being the usual methods employed for recording. Toads were connected to counterweights by way of nylon thread tied at the knee region. During the process of automatically recording activity of am- phibians, it has been possible to provide animals with large aquaria, three feet in length placed so as to tilt towards one end. The lower half serves as a pond area, the upper half is a soil and grass ter- rarium. Activity records resulting through use of Unit apparatus in connection with an environment offering a variety of conditions do not show the ex- tremes in degree of activity as appears when animals are confined to very small (directly recording) activ- ity cages. This holds true for toads whether a small tray of water is or is not included in their container. An explanation may be that toads tend to go to water and remain in water to some extent at night during the breeding season. If a suitable body of water that can be easily recognized by toads is not avail- able, their activity becomes exaggerated in degree above that which would be normal. A problem that is not yet completely solved in this connection is how toads find water. Toads have often been observed to climb a foot-high fence situated across one end of a backyard and continue their course to a lily pool that is thirty feet from the fence and not visible from ground-level at that distance (Knipp 1941). Unit apparatus of the electrical type will probably not prove useful in activity studies of small mammals, since individuals of some species at least spend con- siderable time biting or clawing any harness into which they are placed. This is true for the mouse, Microtus ochregaster Wagner (experiments not pub- lished). Methods of obtaining separate records of niche and community activities of vertebrates, etc., are presented in connection with technical difficulties. SOLVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES The problem of separating seclusion niche and community activity is solved for the house wren, catbird, robin, and phoebe with especial regard to parental care and community activity by having an electric treadle switch situated at nest entrances. For this method, different positions taken by a double magnetic recorder (operated through two treadles in a single pathway) indicate the time at which animals leave or enter their niches (Kendeigh &amp; Baldwin 1930). By having separate exit and en- trance tunnels connected with a nest box, an electric treadle switch in each pathway and a one-day door at each end of both tunnels, magnetic recorders indi- cate when an animal enters and leaves its nest (L. Foss 1941, personal communication). For the wood rat, a pendulum switch is situated at the entrance of a niche (Spencer 1939, 1941). A contact is placed on both sides of the pendulum, each one leading to a double-magnet recorder as for the Kendeigh-Baldwin method. The time at which an animal is in and out of its niche is indicated by the position of the line that is drawn by a magnetic pen on a chronograph tape. The space within which an experinental animal can move is quite limited when it is attached directly to recording levers. A recording lever can be bal- anced carefully by a- light counterweight when mouinted on jeweled pivots. If glazed smoked paper on a Harvard kymograph is used in connection with such a lever, friction and the limitation of space</page><page sequence="60">398 TILDENW. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 available to an animal are at a minimum for direct levers. Similar levers have been used in physiolog- ical research for a considerable period. For pulley and sliding-bridge activity unit switches, space that the animal can cover is not limited beyond a reasonable degree (that is, not beyond that which it is practical to provide for laboratory or field ex- periments), since a pulley switch may be placed sufficiently high to allow a leeway of a number of feet for the counterweight (Roberts 1941, 1941a, 1941b). Also, the length of sliding-bridge switches may amount to several feet. In the several tvpes of apparatus which do not require direct connections between animals and apparatus, space available to animals is not unreasonably limited, if limited at all. The possibility that a direct connection to an animal may alter activity has been stated (Spoor 1941). This is reasonable for instances in which a pull upon experimental animals is more than negligible, and probably holds for all organisms having nervous systems sufficiently highly developed to enable them to be aware of being attached. Unit switches re- quire such light counterweights (as low as .02 gram) that the pull upon ordinary animals is insignificant; that is, more than counter-balanced by the animal's own weight. All but the smallest organisms can move about in any direction without showing any exertion. During two years experience in using unit apparatus in connection with certain crustaceans and amphibians, animals have never shown evidence that their attention may be focused upon, diverted by, or influenced by the thread that connects animals to counterweights. A very valuable contribution is offered for meas- uring fish activity by a method that does not limit the space an experimental animal would normally tend to take (Spoor 1941). The same method does not require a direct connection between animal and apparatus, and as stated by Spoor omits the exist- ence of a factor that may in many instances be an adverse influence and source of error in measurement of activity. Through using a number of apparatus units each one leading to a separate recorder (and probably also by adjusting sensitivity), this appa- ratus provides a means of measuring locomotion as distinct from mere fin movement. There are several methods which do not require direct connections between animal and recording ap- paratus. These include: treadle methods (Kendeigh &amp; Baldwin 1930; Fautin 1941; Foss 1941; R. Linde- borg 1941, personal communication); other treadle methods (Lutz 1932a, 1932b; cf., Park 1935; Park 1935); the pendulum method (Spencer 1939, 1941); audio-frequency apparatus (Emerson 1929; Park 1937); a drop-bar activity apparatus (Wright 1939); the piezo-electric recording apparatus (Odum 1941; Odum &amp; Kendeigh 1940); the paddle-switch method (Spoor 1941); and tambour-controlled activ- ity apparatus (Szymanski 1914). Observance of tracks at hourly intervals has also been emploved as a means of determining the times at which certain animals are active (Szymanski 1918). By using sev- eral strategically spaced apparatus-units it should prove possible to measure locomotion as distinct from other activities by several methods including the following: the audio-frequency method, the piezo- electric method, treadle methods, and tambour- controlled recorders. Some of these modifications and other methods are probably in use at present. Ordinarily, methods are limited in some respect either in being practical only for aquatic animals or only for terrestrial animals, or they may be ca- pable of measuring activity of only relatively large animals. SOME FACTORS THAT MAY ACCOUNT FOR VARIATIONS IN RESEARCH RESULTS 1. Reaction to light may be reversed or prevented when animals are subjected to temperatures above or below certain levels. This phenomenon occurs for certain copepods (Loeb 1893), certain crayfish (Bell 1906), and leaf-mining beetles (Chapman 1923). 2. Reaction to light may be reversed or checked by chemical influences. The aquatic mites, Unioni- cola, are positive to light when in pure water. When stimulated by dilute chemicals that emanate from clam tissues, these mites are negatively phototropic, possibly as a result of conditioning of photic re- sponse to light during immature stages (Welsh 1930). Also see Loeb 1900, p. 198; Barnes 1937, p. 339. 3. Evidently phototaxis may change with height of tide, becoming negative when the tide is high and positive when the tide is low. This behavior is illus- trated by Littorina as observed by Bohn (cf., Holmes 1911, p. 157). See point 13. 4. Reaction to light may change according to whether illumination is direct or diffuse, as illus- trated by Cambarus affinis (Bell 1906). 5. Reaction to light may change from positive to negative in accordance with intensity of light. Man- ner of reactions to various influences (light, pH, etc.) depends upon intensity of the stimulus (Warden et al. 1940). 6. Reaction to light and shade of background may vary for crustacea according to the proportion of light that reaches the dorsal, lateral, and ventral surfaces of the eyes, as illustrated by certain shrimp and crayfish. How these animals react to light de- pends largely upon whether the background upon which they rest is light or dark (Keeble 1904; Brown 1934). 7. Change in light intensity may regulate the man- ner in which adult toads react to air and water (see text). 8. A minute "pin-hole" trace of light may bring about maximum response, as illustrated by influence of light on chromatophores of Macromysis (Keeble 1904). It is important therefore either to keep "darkrooms" perfectly dark or to provide constant illumination when investigating whether endogenouL rhythms synchronize with day and night.</page><page sequence="61">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 399 9. Reactions of animals to light may require such a long tine that investigators might conclude light exerts no influence. When Hippolyte is transferred to an enlvir onment characterized by background col- ors different to those to which it has been accustomed, about seven days are required before color adjust- ment to niew surround(inlgs takes place (Gamble &amp; Keeble 1900; Clark 1921; cf., Pearse 1939). 10. Imnmiatur e animals may respond one way to light and adults in a different way. This phenomenon has been observed for the shrimp Palaemon (Keeble 1904) and crayfish, Cambarus affinis (Andrews 1907). 11. MIales may react differently to light than do the females of the same species. This type of be- havior difference between sexes has been described for certaill copepods (Parker 1902; cf., Pearse 1939). 12. Feeding may reverse or check reaction of ani- mals to gravity. This is noted to occur for certain caterpillars (Loeb 1918). 13. Changes in barometric and water pressure may reverse or check response of animals to gravity. This influenice of pressure upon reaction to gravity has been described for Cambarus affinis (Bell 1906). 14. Touch may check photo-response in the shrimp Macromysis (Keeble 1904). 15. Temperature differences may alter the manner in which animals respond to gravity. This phenom- enon is illustrated by Cambaruts affinis (Bell 1906). 16. Significant results cannot be obtained if ani- inals are allowed to become fatigued unless a special problem of studying fatigue is undertaken. Behavior of crayfish illustrates this point (Kalmus 1938; Rob- erts 1941a). 17. Quantitative variations in an environmental factor&gt; may bring about qualitative differences in biotic phenomena as shown by recognition of colors. 18. Behavior differences may result from influence of environment on structure. In turn, modified be- havior may assist in bringing about further modi- fication of structure. See modified growth phe- nomena. 19. Responses to stimuli may be reversed as a result of internal changes that occur without relation to external influence, such as changes brought about by reaching sexual maturity (Shelford 1937, p. 30). 20. The inherent natur e of particular individuals that are selected for study may account for apparent discrepancies of research results (Crozier &amp; Hoag- land 1934). 21. The kind of stimuli to which animals are ex- posed and the extent that animals are conditioned to stimuli just previous to their subjection to change in intensity of stimuli are factors of importance in modifying behavior. 22. Past conditioning through the formation of nervous associations or conditioned response tendency may influence experimental results. Consider the nature of Unionicola's response to light. 23. It is not safe to make physiological tests on organisms nor to take extracts from organisms for experimental tests only during the day since endog- enious rhythmic influences may modify physiological states and behavior tendencies. Endogenous influ- ences may be sufficiently powerful to dominate or camouflage effects of stimuli to which animals are subjected for experimental tests. 24. Averages of many records do not reveal endo- genous rhythms except when such rhythms syn- chronize with definite influences. Therefore, there are instances when single activity records reveal more than averages of many records. 25. The percentage of activity which is nocturnal and diurnal for exogenous nychthemeral rhythms has often been based upon the proportion of activity that occurs from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M. as compared to the amount of activity that occurs in the 24-hour period (6 P.M. to 6 P.M.). This permits a great error when night and day are quite different in length. Also, night may not begin at 6 P.M. It is proper to determine percentages of activity that occur during periods of special environmental factor complexes by comparing the amount of activity that occurs during hours of darkness to the amount of activity that occurs during day-light hours. 26. For averages of environmentally controlled rhythms, such as light-controlled rhythms, activity records of the first hours that immediately follow daylight should be averaged together and activity records that immediately follow darkness should be averaged together. Hours that immediately follow daybreak and those that immediately follow darkness should be spaced twelve hours apart. Averages for the hours of activity for the intermediate hours should be spaced for averaging in reference to times that dark- ness and daylight begin and not in regard to clock time. When periods of thirteen hours or more are reduced to twelve hours as when days or nights are longer than twelve hours, those hours that overlap may be dropped or averaged. When days or nights are shorter than twelve hours, the spacing of day- break and dusk to twelve hours apart leaves a gap of one or more hours. This gap may be filled by intercalation. The averages of activity for the hours on each side of the gap may be merely connected by drawing a line between two points plotted on a graph of activity. This system is the only one that permits a stand- ardization of activity curves. If this method is not followed in averaging environmentally controlled rhythms, the averages of activity peaks tends to flatten due to the fact that night begins at a different time each day. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. When recording activity on a 24-hour kymo- graph drum, there is great possibility of error as a result of overlapping of units for direct activity- lever attachments and suspended cage movements. 2. Activity marks made by levers attached directly to animals or to cages do not represent equivalent amounts of activity, and do not merit numerical translation into units, unless one cares to measure</page><page sequence="62">400 TILDEN W. ROBERTS EEcological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 the relative lenigths of the activity marks in order to determine their values. The latter procedure is so time consuming as to hinder progress. 3. For ally given period for the same methods as mentioned above-duration of activity can be de- termined by comparing amount of horizontal kymo- graph space covered by horizontal lines to the amount of horizonital space covered by slanting lines, but this method is also too time wasting to be desirable. 4. Wheni these direct methods of recording are employed, activity of an animal while in its seclusion niche registers as general activity, and community activities are niot distinguishable from seclusion niche activities. 5. Activitiy curves based upon general body move- inent have only physiological significance. The times at which particular kinds of activities occur is of ecological significance. 6. Population densities based upon the number of active individuals in time communities are more likely to be ecologically significant than population densities based upoIn the total numbers of individuals in place communities. Diurnal and nocturnal communities possess their own population densities. 7. Environmental conditions to which animals are subjected for activity recordings and laboratory ob- servations should resemble conditions of an animal's natural environment as closely as possible. All en- vironmental influences should be allowed to fluctuate at a given time in a reasonable portion of experi- ments. Generally, a portion of experiments requires constanit conditions, and another portion requires that all influences remain constant except one. Laboratory studies of behavior should be supported by field studies. 8. Knowledge of activity of immature animals is as important as that conieerning adults. 9. It is as important to know the nature of activity of animals out of the breeding season as well as that which occurs during the breeding season. It is im- portant that activity researches state whether animals are studied in the breeding season. 10. Probable trends in the evolution of several be- havior traits are given. Their consideration eluci- dates relationships between different characteristics and assists in augmenting the significance of a classification. Complex behavior traits are reached via evolution- ary processes through stages of less complexity. After a stage of complexity is once attained, evolu- tion may follow a course towards greater complexity or greater simplicity. This is an illustration of or- ganisms taking lines of least resistance so far as particular inherited and environmental equipment are involved. That which represents maximum simplicity for one kind of organism may be the most complex route possible to another type of organism. 11. A force or phenomenon may manifest itself (with our limited ability in detecting biological phe- nomena) only in what would appear to be exceptions to a rule. To emphasize the importance of this fact can assist in discovering obscure phvsiological rhythms and in finding the existence of behavior tendencies that appear to be absent in the majority of examples. By following this idea instead of con- cluding that definite landmarks are important for the orientation of all birds, it was possible for a branch of the United States army to develop night- flying homing pigeons. Consider also: the average interval in occurrence of pronounced locomotor activ- ity for a crayfish when kept in constant darkness. The average interval (about 24 hours) and its sig- nificance are niot apparent without application of mathematics to data. 12. Biological science should advance more effi- ciently and at a more rapid rate when it is assumed that entirely new-and perhaps unthought of- mechanisms may exist to control commonly observed phenomena, rather than assume that mechanisms probably already known through studies of some organisms should account for phenomena thus far unexplained in other organisms. Conclusions con- cerning the importance of landmarks for the homing of some organisms have been given prematurely, and chance has sometimes been offered as a possible explanation without support of computation of mathematical probability. An important attitude in research has achieved results in a study of orientation in bats, and may lead to valuable discoveries in con- nection with mechanisms that enable both bats and homing pigeons to return to home areas over exten- sive unknown territory. 13. The fact that many animals are brilliantly colored is not evidence that protective coloration is of little value. Brightly colored animals have some other adaptation that replaces and is equivalent to adaptation of resemblance to surroundings. Also, bright color is useful in many instances. 14. A synopsis of behavior of organisms is pre- sented. Activities are subdivided so that different adaptations that meet the same ends may be com- pared so as to illustrate parallelism, adaptive radi- ation, and convergence of behavior adaptations. 15. Mere growth or secretion for some organisms' is perfectly comparable with and equivalent to dy- nainic activity of other organisms. Nutritive, repro- ductive, and protective activities, trap mechanisms, repulsion mechanisms, means of anchorage, means of dispersal, and methods of shelter securement are rep- resented by passive activities in some organisms and by their equivalents in dynamic activities for other organisms. Therefore, passive physiological proc- esses belong to the field of behavior in many instances. GLOSSARY Adaptations and adjustment: The meanings of adaptation and adjustment are often confused. Any structural, physiological, be- havioristic, or psychological traits that help an organ- ism, or aggregation of organisms, or a species, to survive is an adaptation. Individual adaptation. Adaptations of individuals consist of equipment and abilities that meet life requirements while learning</page><page sequence="63">October, 1942 BEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 401 from other individuals is not involved. Equipment and abilities already referred to may involve tenden- cies or motives. The enivironment to which adapta- tions are suited may be static or changing. The abilities to carry out adjustments are always adapta- tions, but not all adjustments depend exclusively upon adaptationis. This applies in those instances in which adjustments depenid upon acquirement of methods, tendencies, or motives through training or encouragement received from other individuals. Ad- ,justmrents are always processes of improvement in the adaptiveness of self in the meeting of life require- ments in response to changing environmental condi- tions. Some ad justments may be made by reliance upon nothing but inherited equipment. Such adjust- ments are equivalent to adaptations. On the other hand, some adjustments depend upon acquirement from other individuals of tendencies, motives, or learning of methods that play a part in adjustment. In such instances, more factors than possession of adaptive abilities are involved. An example of such an adjustmenit is the recovery from certain mental ills where outside aid is required (Sci. Dig. 1942). Species adcaptoition. A species adaptation involves whatever is necessary to carry out a useful act. For primitive man securement of food involved teaching new individuals how to hunt or grow crops plus the ability to learn and carry out the methods learned. Many adaptations and adjustments are described by Pearse (1939). Autecology: Autecology deals with relations of individuals to their environments. It often makes use of phys- iological experiments to obtain knowledge and so tests the responses of parts of living organisms (Pearse 1939, p. 1). Community activity: Community activities of individuals and groups of animals and species are those activities that involve or are likely to influence other individuals-including at least those of different species. Since animals are likely to influence other species such as predators by exposing themselves through movement in the open, "exposed activity" is equivalent to community activ- ity. Locomotor activity is an important community activity. Locomotion correlates so closely with ex- posed activity that it may be used to measure com- munity activity. It is convenient to refer to loco- motion as a synonym for community activity when it is understood that locomotion occurs in the open and represents exposed activity. These terms apply to those animals that move about to get food and are especiallv useful in application to animals which take to shelters during periods of quiescence. Strictly speaking, community activities include: securement of food, retreat or attempts to escape from enemies, movements that attract predators to them or result in their being caught by a predator; for instance, locomotion of ants that results in their falling into the traps of ant-lions. Community activities are based upoin interspecific relations (Pearse 1939, p. 498- 533). Compound instinct: In compound instincts, conipletion of one act serves as a stimulus or release of a new tendency for start- ing another type of specific action. Successive activ- ities depend upon a chain of stimuli, most links of which are generally brought about by an animal's own activity. Consciousness, desire, and volition: Consciousness is a reality only to the extent that it is an abstract function of complex nervous sys- tems, experiences of which nearly coincide with actuality. In consciousness, specialized protoplasmic meehanisms act as intermediaries between conscious centers and environment. In subconsciousness, the conscious center is isolated from environmental stimulation so that mental experiences depend upoii inherited mental equipment and past stimulations received and experienced in relation to actualities. Consciousness is a product of perceptions received through all of the senses available to an organism, and may be in part a result of an assumption, sen- satioii, or belief that objects and experiences are actual. The subconscious state may be fooled in dreams. A nerve center may experience sensations of being conscious as a result of recurrence of ini- pressions while no synchronization exists between mental experience and actuality. This type of men- tal experience falls short of being consciousness only because mental experience is not directly related to actual happenings, and is not as vivid as normally results when experiences and perceptions are created through direct environmental influence. In con- sciousness, each sense enables its own contribution to be created as a space concept within a special nerve center. Each contribution is a part of consciousness. All that appears to an organism as occurring in its environment is known only through what occurs in an animal's own nervous system, for all objects and movements that seem to occur in the environment are imagined to be in space by a phenomenon of the imagination which is the most important aspect of consciousness. Visual and all other perceptions to include physiological pains are not sensed where they seem to be located. A pain in an arm is not actually felt in the arm. This fact is illustrated by the oc- currence of sensations that seem to be located where injured limbs once existed previous to their amputa- tion. Pains are real but their apparent locations are projected entirely in the mind. Sounds are not heard at a distance but within protoplasm. It is equally true that a cloud is not seen in the sky but in the mind by being projected into mental space. This point becomes clear when it is realized that visual perception of depth arises from stimulations sent to conscious centers from almost flat retinal sur- faces. Consciousness is a specially modified "sub- consciousness." Consciousness is equivalent to a dream (a phenomenon of the subeonscious), experi-</page><page sequence="64">402 TILDEN W. ROBERTS Ecological Monographs Vol. 12, No. 4 ences of which are made consistent, vivid, and guided to a great extent through sense perception. This is so literally true that these qualifications of subcon- sciousness serve to define consciousness. Conscious mental experiences do not necessarily represent a true nature of objects perceived, nor do conscious per- ceptions take place at exactly the same time as per- ceived phenomena occur. The archer fish, mantis, chameleon, and kingbird experience perception through consciousness. This logical conclusion relies upon the following considera- tions. The animals mentioned prove by their actions that they perceive depth in visual experience. Through mental experience, these animals recognize the distances visual objects and sources of sound are away from their own positions. This fact is demon- strated by the high degree of accuracy these animals employ in striking and catching their prey. They do not reach or grab for their food until it has been approached to a distance that is appropriate for suc- cessful contact. The archer fish can hit flies by squirting water to distances of several feet. A chameleon is capable of striking flies with its tongue without error at distances of several inches. Nasuate termite soldiers are capable of squirting juice upon enemies within fairly close range without employ- ment of visual perception. (It may be that termite soldiers sense positions of enemies. However, no at- tempt will be made at this time to apply this rea- soning to termites.) Both locomotion and trap mechanisms are guided accurately in relation to position of prey. These considerations provide logical proof that such animals as fishes, mantids, chameleons, and kingbirds project what is perceived into space through consciousness, that is, via a phenomenon of imagination. Their perceptions are projected into space as mental abstractions that represent realities. It has been mentioned above that such perceptions as mental space conceptions are a part of an animal's consciousness; in fact, that mental space-creation is consciousness when practically coincidental with actuality due to environmental stimulation. Desire is a nervous phenomenon that can be ex- perienced by either "consciousness" or "subcon- sciousness" in relation to concepts of objects or experiences that symbolize mental satisfaction or pain. Objects or experiences may become symbols of satisfaction or pain through experience (condi- tioned mental experience), or through imagination (trial and error or random thinking), especially when in combination with wishful thinking. Desires and wishes do not depend directly upon consciousness, for they can be experienced in subconscious nervous states (dreams). It is reasonable that desire and volition are quali- ties of conscious mental experience when behavior is modifiable according to nature of past experience and consciously controlled. This reasoning is applicable to many lower animals as well as to man and is based upon the only available explanation for behavior that is both modifiable and consistent in accordance with peculiarities of objects and acts that are ab- stractly perceived when peculiarities of objects and actions are responsible for the nature of symbols formed which are in turn responsible for repetition or inhibition of acts. This explanation is as follows: some acts and objects become symbols of "satisfac- tion" through past experience. It is recognized that the most primitive type of satisfaction may be repre- sented by absence of pain. Some acts and objects become symbols of pain. Some activities are con- trolled through stimulation by objects and happen- ings that symbolize neither pain nor satisfaction according to observed reactions. Such activities may be carried out through self-guidance, and organiisms may or may not be conscious of these activities. Such activities never can serve as evidence that desire, volition, or consciousness accompany activities. Symbols are perceived through mental abstractions, that is, as conscious conceptions. Definite positive or negative conscious reactions to symbols are based upon mental tendencies. Tendencies-so character- ized-are known as desires. Employment of this criterion to judge when desires occur in animals re- veals that many other animals besides humans are capable of experiencing desires. This is not an indi- cation that any lower organisms are ever capable of realizing consciousness of their desires. Conscious- ness of one's own desires involves "self-consciousness" which is practically lacking in all animals except humans and probably certain apes. Confliction of desires or confusion results when an object becomes a symbol of both pain and satisfac- tion, or when two or more like svmbols excite an animal simultaneously. When desire is responsible for instigation or execution of action, such action is designated as vol- untary. Thus, organisms which are capable of ex- periencing desire are also capable of experiencing volition. This does not mean that any lower organisms are conscious of a sensation of volition experience. Volition is performance of an act guided by desire. Voluntary actions are those dependent upon desire for their instigation or/and execution. This defi- nition of volition also serves to define "free will." Desire may or may not be dependent upon fore- thought, sense of right and wrong, aesthetic sense, physiological drives, learning, training, or emotions. Desire may or may not amount to an emotion in some human activities carried out by volition. De- sire may be dependent upon a determination to illus- trate that any desire can be inhibited or carried out at a time chosen by a performer. In the latter in- stance, a line of least resistance is being followed as for all others; since an original desire is dominated by a new and greater desire. In this instance a de- sire to inhibit or carry out an action is dominated by a desire to demonstrate "free will." A principal desire can initiate the subdesires necessary to carry out a main objective. Behavior is at the mercy of desires for animals that recognize symbols of pain and symbols of agreeableness.</page><page sequence="65">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 403 Origin of desire and volitioin undoubtedly precedes or arises coincidentally with origin of intelligent actioii. This is shown by the fact that children realize desire anid volition before intelligence becomes functional. It is not strange that desire and volitioll should occur to some extent in those lower animals which show soine intelligence. As previously ex- plained, behavior of aiiiinals that is very readily modifie(d when associated with conscious perception of pain is an instance of intelligent action. The converse tends to hold true. Hlumans that do not possess the ability to learii to inhibit acts when pun- ished show lack of intelligence and are likely to possess the inental development of imbeciles. How- ever, refusal to learn as a result of powerful endog- c-nous countertendencies does not prove lack of intelligence. Anirnals that are capable of learning r eadily through conscious reactions include some fishes and animals above the fish level of complexity that reveal evidences of consciousness. A question as to whether desire, volition, or con- sciousness exist in many lower organisms should not remain after these points are conisidered. Logic and the rule of parsimony require that the probabilities mentioned shoul(d be assumed unless negative evi- dence can be provided. At present the only sensible question that remains is to what extent vividness of volition, desire, and consciousness occur in different species. In somne organismns, existence of these quali- ties must be zero. There should be intergradations in vividness of sensation from zero in the lowest organisms to a state of extreme realization in humai beings. It is now realized that desires are not dependent upon nervous systems alone. They are in some in- stances at least indirectly dependent upon hormonal influences which modify nervous centers. This has been demonstrated by glandular studies of peck order and parental care in fowls. With proper hormonal influemwe, a weak hen will become dominant over other hens of a flock; and a young pullet will become a foster parent. That some desires are similarly con- trolled in humans has also been proved by sex in- juries, oleratiomls, and reversals. Chemicals may evidently brinig about their influence upon instinct by nmodifying centrtal nervous centers or through effect upon effectors. It is within the realm of logic to show that con- sciousness, desire, and volition are phenomena experi- enced by some lower organisms. Although it is beyond humani comprehension at present to under- stand how pIrotoplasm or matter of any sort can acquire abstract properties of consciousness an(l emotions, ther e is reasonable proof that the nature of consciousnesFs and desires has a mechanistic basis as evidence(d by studies of inentalitv and char acter of identical twins, geniuses, and the intellectuallyT incomipetent, aii(l as evidence( byv compar'sonis of desires and behavior tenidencies of personis before andl after brain operations (reference: authorities in the fields of psychology and nmedicine and Sci. News Letter). Anthropomorphic interpretations are formed by what is implied by similarity of behavior of lower animals to the actions of and associated sensations of man. Anthropomorphic interpretations are unscieii- tific and are naturally to be looked down upon. Conclusions drawn by way of logic are not anthro- pomorphic. It is not what is concluded but the manner in which conclusions are drawn that counts. Summary: Mental images have usually been con- sidered to belong to one of two classes: (1) concrete images when created through sense perception, (2) abstract images when occurring in mind as after im- pressions (menmory) or imagination (modified after impressions and mental creations). This differentia- tion does not have a sound basis. All images that are experienced in mind are abstractions. The only differences between images that are created through sense perceptions and those that occur as after-im- pressions are that those images that depend directly upon sense perception for their formation are nor- mally more vivid and more exact than are memories or invented images. Both types of images are cre- ated as abstractions in the SAME protoplasm. This idea is proved by the following fact. Motion pic- tures do not flicker as a result of the existence of after-impressions. This is possible because after- impressions are vivid and exact for a brief perioa. An animal that experiences both consciousness (as shown by criteria that reveal the occurrence of mental space creation) and will (as evidenced bv criteria that reveal modification of behavior in accordance with the peculiarities of abstract symbols), possesses to some extent those nervous qualities designated as desire and volition ("free will"). In order that this judgment be justified, it must be applied onlv to initial acts and not to habitual acts, for there must be evidence that guidance of behavior occurs via consciousness and not through mere subconsciousness. (Habitual and unmodifiable acts cannot serve as evi- dence of will because they can occur via primitive physiological processes.) These principles for anal- ysis of consciousness, desire, and volition should usually be applied without disregard of Mor gan's law (cf., Holmes 1911). Scientists are more inter- ested in probabilities than proofs. Most research data are significant according to coefficients of prob- abilities and are not proofs in a literal sense. The eriteria offered to determine whether mental phe- iiomena of animals are on the psychological level can never give positive proof of con-sciousness. However, wlhat is expected for proof can be carrie(d to a point of absur(lity. It is unreasonable to regard simple animals such as protozoa ai(i others which do not have speecalized senses and a brain as capable of experiencinig con- sciousiiess to any extent, becauise we cannot conceive of the existence of a phenomenon unless some cri- terion or evi(lelece or logic can be produced for the formulatioii of belief. This probleni cannot be an- swercd( for those animals in which it cannot be (letelhinie(1 whether mental space-projection p)he- noricia ocecur.

ROBERTS Ecological Monogra.hs Vo.1,N.4 insects, an(l all but the simplest chordates there is evideniee of consciousness, and many experiments that have been carried out to determine the nature of modifiability of behavior reveal evidences of desire and volitioil. According to Webster, desire may be defined as conative consciousness or (conscious) inclination. In this treatise, pain and satisfaction are emploved in the broadest sense. Pain can be experienced with- out emotioni. Although satisfaction is usuallv thought of as an emotion, its most primitive equivalent is lack of pain. It is not safe to assume that inverte- brates anid lower chordates sense pain as a conscious sensation, but some phenomenon equivalent to pain must take place. It is not assumed that lower ani- mals experience any emotions. Pieron's criterion for the occurrence of a mental phenomenon in lower or- ganisms that is equivalent to emotion may possibly be souud when (but only when) it is revealed that conscious abstractions or symbols determine the nature of action (Warden et al. 1940, p. 788-789). Dvnamic cominunity: A dynamic community consists of all the organ- isms in a place-commiiunity which-at any particular time are actively exposed in the community. DY- namic community nmeans active time-community (Elton 1935, p. 86). Ecology: Eeology is the science concerned with relations of organisms to their environment (Adams 1913; Shel- ford 1937; Elton 1935; Pearse 1939). Environmental factor: An enviroiimental factor is a possible or potential ecological influence and may he considered as syn- oniymous with environmental condition. Light, dark- ness, heat, vibrations, evaporative tendency of air, physical pressure, are examples of environmental factors and become ecological factors when organisms come into coiitact with them. They are ecological influenices in those inistances in which they affect organisms. Exposed activity: All activities that occur for animals while thev are not concealed (either through taking advantage of shelters orl by relying upon protective coloration or/and quieseeniee) are exposed activities. Habit and rhythm: Habits are acquired methods or sequences of actions in the repetition of activities. Almost un- limited variation in time may occur in the perform- ance of each of the activities of a complex act. As long as a definite sequence of different actions is correctly carried out, peculiarities that characterize an entire act as a habit are not being violated. The meaning of "habit" as used in relation to method or sequence of different activities is probably more ap- propriate than the application of this word to acquired periodicitv in alternation of activity and quiescence. It is sufficient to characterize rhvthmic tendencies as "rhythmic phenomena" without relating this quality of action to habit. A rhythm is periodic release of energy or response to periodic releases of energy, or may involve both endogenous regulation and response. An acquired rhythm is based upon modification of tendency of energy release and may be merely a result of modification in rate of energy release; whereas, all habits are learned actions; not mere modifications of rates of processes. Rhythms may be acquired by single cells. Blossoms of some cacti, such as Cereus, can open and close in contin- uous darkness as a result of endogenous influences. Many rhythmic biological phenomena originate inde- pendently of environmenital influences; for instance, the beating of hearts, movements of appendages of fairy shrimps, and electrical activity of ganglia (Prosser 1934). Individualistic activity: Individualistic activities are those which concern only the individual. Examples of "personal" activ- ities are: the process of feeding, cleaning the body, etc. Instinet: Instinct signifies behavior that is not learned, nor innovated, nor modified by intelligence. When modi- fied, it should be designated as modified instinct. The word instinct is important because it has no syn- onym. Words are invented in order to eradicate descriptive phrases. Simple instinct consists of a single unlearned, uninvented, and unmodified action in contrast to compoun(l instinct which consists of two or more different acts, one following another ill a definite sequence. There are modified simple iii- stincts and modified compound instincts. A single link or all links of a compound instinct mav be modified. Unnecessary links may be eliminated to give abbreviated instinct to illustrate one tvpe of modification. Instinet appears to depend upon chem- ical conditions of protoplasm (Hartman 1942). Evi- dently, chemicals rnay regulate instinct by influencing brains. It is possible that chemicals may modify effectors (Loeb, cf., Livingston 1903; Barnes 1937, p. 338). Intelligent or intellectual behavior: Intelligence is capacity to react beneficially to situations that require originality in action or choice of possible actions. Intelligence involves knowledge or understanding or depends upon previous mental experience, and therefore exists only on a psycholog- ical level (Webster). 1. In new situations. Innovative or inventive in- telligence; that is, reasoning. a. Advanced intelligent action. Trial and error thought procedure followed bv action. Be- havior is guided by forethought, in turn de.- pendent upon employment of mechanical activities, such as, trial and error thinking, inhibition of thoughts that are least adaptive, and selection of the most fit. Efficient think- ing is analogous to choice of shortest routes</page><page sequence="67">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANIISMS 4 05 and reduction in random movements as occurs in aniiimals well experienced in orienitationi and in finding their way home when released at great distances firom their horne areas. In man, f'orethought is at first substituted for physical activity as an indirect route to solve problems that are solved through direct activ- ity by most lower organisms. b.

Benieficial behavior guided without forethought. Intelligence without forethought probably occurs in wasps that use tools. Lower organismiis tend to try out one p)rocedure or another probablv without previously thinking about probable outcomes. If ani act tried is successful, opportunities for their recurrence comes again. Tendeency to repeat successful acts increases as a result of strengthened nervous associations and op- portunity is ofteni extended for the reproduc- tion of offspring that inherit a capacitv to repeat the same acts. Both beneficial con- scious trial and error acts and acts based upon selection of appropriate actions as de- terrnined by forethought represent intelligent action. Intelligent actions of human beings are not distinct from those occurring in somne lower orgasnisms except that they are often preceded by and guided by abstract trial arid error and selective mental processes. Mental tendencies may be considered as determined. They dliffer according to the manner in which the mind is trained in the use of thought meehanisms. Trial and error mental tenden- cies are carried out in a inanner similar to less abstract and mechanical nervous activi- ties of sonie "lower" organiisms relatively high on the scale of nervous comnplexity and are also analogons to the trial an(d error actionis of Paramnecium. 2. Intelligenit behavior dependent upon learned mental associations related to the behavior situatioi in questioil. a. Selection of objects or acts learned through previous personal experience based upon the nattire of past experience.

Learned thirou-h observation of what hap- pens for othelr imi(livi(lmials. c. Learned via abstract coimnunication. Locomotion : Amiimnals can locomote wNlhile in their seelusioni niches. Hlowever, space ill the seclnsiosn niches of iost animal species is very limited. It is, therefore, convenient to consider locomnotioni as occurring in the open unl1less otherwise stated. Locomnotion is so closely correlated with securement of food anid escape from enemies that rneasur erlleInt of locomlotion inay he accepted as nmeasuremenlt of commintnniity activity or exposed activity. Niche activity: "Niche activity" as used in this treatise meanis "seclusion niche activity"; that is, activity of an animal that occurs while the aninal is in its seelusion niche. For exarmple, a crayfish may locomote to a slight extent anid perform hody-cleaninig inovements while it is in its seelu-sioni niche. Such activities are "niche activities" so long as they are carried out ill the niche. Niche activity is synonyrnons with "con- cealed acivity." Noctornal commanniuity: A night-comnininity consists of all inember s of a place-comminuniity that are active in the open dur ng the perliod of darkness. The nocturnal community is one of the timne-commonities, and onlv those organ- isms which take part in community (lynamics con- stitute a part of it (Elton 1935, p. 83). Nychthemneral: Nychthemeral refers to a period that consists of a day plus a night. It has no synonym. This word has heeni used repeatedly hy Bohn (1903) and Parker (1919). Physiological ecology: The scope of physiological ecology has heen given by Shelford (1937, p. 299-308). Psychological: Pertains to abstract-though not necessarily con- scious rnental phenomena. Place-comnmunity: A place-comminunity consists of all of the organisms within any particular territory characterize(d through- out hy the presence of particular species (SShelford 1937, p. 3; Clemnenits &amp; Shelfor(d 1939; Eltoni 1935, p. 86). Securenment of food: Seenirenient of food inivolves going after food, andl oftern niecessitates catching or trappinig it with some skill wheni food is animnate. Securemienit of food is a communr ity activity anid contr asts w'itlh feedling aftet food is obtained. The act of eating is an individlual- istic activitv. Species activitv: Species activity refers to those hehaivior relatioris that occur hetween memhers of a sl)ecies. Species activities include matiig amid takinig caire of yvoung. Species activity comprises hehavior hased upon initra- specific relatiorns (Pearse 1939, ). 458-497).</page><page sequence="68">Ecological Monographs 406 TILDEN W ROBERTS 1~Vol. 12, No. 4 Syniecology: Synecology is the branch of ecology concerned with interrelations that occur among members of particular communities and the relations that exist between plant-animal societies-considered as a whole and their environments (Shelford 1937; Pearse 1939; Clements &amp; Shelford 1939). Time-community: A time-community consists of all of the animals in a place community that are active in the open during a particular time period characterized by a special complex of environmental conditions. Di- urnal and nocturnal communities are examples of time-communities. Tropism: Tropism does not apply to a class of complexity of response. Tropism must be applied independently of all the known classes of complexity of actions such as instinct, learned behavior, intelligent modi- fication of behavior and creative behavior. Tropism applies to a manner of response, that is, to whether movement of an animal is towards or away from a stimulus. Tropism covers predictable reactions to particular stimuli. It is correct to regard tropistic tendencies as automatic or mechanical although they are not necessarily instinctive. The opinion that tropisms are necessarily instinctive is a misconcep- tion that resulted from the fact that the person who first elaborated upon tropisms believed all behavior to be automatic and mechanical in its last analysis. Loeb believed that human behavior is free only to the extent that desires control behavior. He believed that desires are dependent upon what environmental experience does with inherited tendencies and that all of man's behavior follows lines of least resist- ance. No one has offered evidence that Loeb was mistaken. On the contrary, the results of brain and gland operations prove his views to be correct. How- ever, most zo6logists who adopted the word tropism as soon as it was made available either did not quite understand or did not accept Loeb's point of view. They took the term tropism and applied it only to behavior which in their own opinions could come under the scope of mechanistic philosophy. Tropisms are natural tendencies. They may be either instinctive or learned through conditioned ex- perience. When higher organisms inhibit a tropistic tendency, a desire (of a high order) is merely domi- nating a more primitive tendency. If tropistic tend- ency is experienced in consciousness, it is to be regarded as a desire of either a high or low order depending upon how abstract is the concept of the stimulus. Concepts are abstract if perceived as images that seem to be projected into space. If an organism goes towards or away from a stimulus as a result of intelligence, the act is a tropism, providing the manner of action is predictable. The criterion of predietableness indicates that the nature of an act is within the scope of automatic and mechanical behavior. All behavior would be predictable if all could be known concerniing the heredity of particular individuals, anid if all could be knowni regarding past experiences and their influences. An illustration of a tropism as it can be experi- enced by human beings may make the concept clearer. A person lost in a forest tends to go to the first artificial light that may be seen. Carrying out of this natural tendency illustrates a tropism even though fear might cause such a tropistic tendenev to be inhibited. A young child might not tend to react positively to light until after learning to think of a light in connection with a home. The learned asso- ciation of light and home would be sufficient to produce a natural tendency for definite predictable positive response. Responses cease to be tropistic only when natural tendencies to move towards or away from stimuli are confused or completely inhibited by thought proc- esses. Ducks that have learned to recognize water respond to it tropistically. Their response to water may be possibly tropistic the first time they see it. On the other hand, a person who refuses to go swim- ming because of fear of punishment or because of desires to do other things is not reacting to water in a tropistic manner. His action is not a response to water but a positive reaction to fears or desires re- lated to other factors than water. Refusal to go into water as a result of fear of water has all the essen- tial aspects of a tropism. "A tropism is most effectively defined as an ori- ented movement in an energy field" (Crozier 1928, p. 214; Barnes 1937, p. 338). Misconceptions of tropisms are pointed out by Crozier (1928, p. 214) and Warden et al. (1940). Taxes such as phototaxis amount to directed locomotion. Normally, each species of animal orients towards or away from stimuli by orienting its front, side, or back to stimuli. So, taxes and kineses are normally tropisms at least in part, and for the sake of brevity may be referred to as "tropisms" since tropisms are always involved. Re- versal in taxis moveinent does not always involve reversal of the part of the body that faces a stimulus. An animal may orient towards a st mulus and move away from the stimulus at the same m9mcnt a negative tropism from the standpoint of total move- ment (cf. Barnes 1937, p. 339). "Loeb's approach to the problem of individual organic behavior (1918) was initially and primarily philosophic, in the sense that through recognition of the elements of action and the modes of their control, he looked to find an answer to the puzzles of free will and determinism. With the insight pelrmitted to a superbly penetrating intelligence, he was able to see beyond the immediate consequences of relatively simple experiments and to extract from them their utmost general significance. A quantitative treat- ment of tropistic behavior is essential if the undel standing of conduct is to be furthered in this way. It is curious and noteworthy, however, that very seldom do current general discussions of the tropism situation appear to realize the significance of the</page><page sequence="69">October, 1942 BEIIAVIOR OF ORGANISMS 407 quantitative aspects of behavior" (Crozier 1928, p. 213). The tropism theorv for orientation of bilateral animals as presented by Loeb cannot explain orienta- tion mechanisms of all animals (Warden et al. 1940). This is not a fault with the theory since Loeb was especially concerned with one type of orientation mechanism and did not believe that "deflected nervous mechanisms should accouiit for all orientations." This is obvious s nce Loeb considered tropistic be- havior of protozoa as well as tropistic actions of arthropods. BIBLIOGRAPHY Allee, W. C. 1931. Animal aggregations. Chicago ix + 431. 1938.
