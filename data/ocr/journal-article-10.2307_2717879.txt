<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 93 Heinrich ZIMMER, Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civili- zation, edited by Joseph CAMPBELL. The Bollingen Series VI. New York: Pantheon Books Inc., 1946. Pp. xiii + F248, pls. 70. $4.50. In 1942 Heinrich ZIMMER gave a course of lectures at Columbia University. After his death in 1943, his lecture notes were edited and rearranged by Mr. Joseph CAMPBELL. The book under review is the result of these labors. In discussing the book it is well to bear in mind its posthumous character. Had ZIMMER lived he might well have added to or changed the text in order to present more clearly his point of view. ZIMMER interprets Indian symbols and mythology by explaining the metaphysical ideas and yoga experiences which he believes underlie them. " Our task," he says, " as students of Indian myth and symbol, is to understand the abstract conceptions of India's philosophical doctrines . . ," and again, " The mythical tales are meant to convey the wisdom of the philosophers and to ex- hibit in popular, pictorial form the experiences or results of yoga." This method of investigation seems to the reviewer too limited. But before criticizing it, it is only fair to show its advantages. ZIMMER'S method can be used successfully in dealing with two fields of Indian studies: the Tantric symbolism, and those myths of the epics which are primarily of philosophical interest. In the case of Tantric symbolism it is obviously the only method by which to proceed, for the symbols are expressly given meta- physical meanings by the Tantrics themselves. We possess texts by which to interpret them. ZIMMui's explanation of the Sr1- yantra in his chapter on Siva-Sakti is excellent, as are also his remarks on the dance of Siva. Here his interpretation can be shown to be the Indian interpretation. When dealing with the philosophical myths of the epics, one must proceed more cautiously, since the symbolism is not often explained by the texts themselves. Among ZIMMER's successes I should list his interpretation of two myths dealing specifically with maya.' In one myth, Narada is shown the power of mdya ' The first of these myths is stated by ZIMMER (p. 27) to be given in the Matsya Purina. This is an error. The myth occurs in Brahma Purdna, Section 228 (Anan-</page><page sequence="2">94 REVIEWS upon entering a lake which transforms him into a woman. The other is the extraordinary tale of how Mdrkandeya wandered about inside the body of Visnu. Markandeya suddenly falls out of Visnu's mouth into the surrounding waters. He asks himself if he is dreaming or if he is subject to an illusion. ZIMMER gives a psychological commentary that is valuable because it suggests a new approach to an important problem in Indian thought. "Reality," he says, " is a function of the individual." While Markandeya was within the cosmic giant he perceived what was congenial to his nature and regarded this as reality although it was only a dream of the giant. Again, he says of Ndrada, " . . . the waters initiated him into the unconscious side of his own being." In another section of the book, ZIMMER develops a theory very close to primitive Buddhism: "We are all of us . . . the victims of our own individual maya. .. Were this not the case we should not be individuals at all." But ZIMMER's method must be used with great care. One is apt to impute to the mythmaker psychological and metaphysical meanings which he never intended. I believe ZIMMER often falls into this snare. He finds symbols of maya everywhere. From this book no one would ever conclude that only a part of Indian philosophy is monistic, and that only a part of that part accepts the theory of mdyd. When ZIMMER applies his method to myths that are not prima- rily of philosophical content, the results seem to me unsatisfactory. An example is his treatment of snake-symbolism. He states on page 692 that the snake as the couch of Visnu is the animal counter- part of the anthropomorphic sleeper himself, and adds that snakes in general symbolize the life-giving power of the terrestial waters. The story of the snake, Mucilinda, who sheltered the Buddha is said to represent a reconciliation of the life-force with the severing of the bonds of life. Two chapters later, when Visnu is rescuing the earth from the serpent of the deep, the serpent (p. 78) represents, indeed, the all-containing substance of Vishnu, but on a primitive level of differentiation." Visnu must counteract dasrama Edition). The second myth is, as stated, from Matsya Purdna 167.13 ff. (Ananddsrama Edition). In the Calcutta text (1876) it occurs in 166.13 ff.)</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 95 " . that retrogressive tendency of his own substance." In the story of Krsna and Kdliya the snake represents a destructive power, but on page 88 the snake-symbol represents the ". divine nature which the hero-savior . . ." Krsna concealed from mortals. At this rate I fail to see what advantage there is in speaking of symbols at all. The abstractions " represented " or " symbolized " are as various as the plots of all the stories in which snakes take part. In the Krsna-Kdliya story, ZIMMER finds Krsna, in his nature of incarnate god, to be a ". . . mediator or moderator, between the antagonistic energies that are active in the life-process of the universe." This approach to mythology by way of metaphysics is, I feel, most unsatisfactory when applied to the Krsna legend. It seems fairly obvious that most of this legend developed long before the identification of Krsna with Visnu. The Krsna myths still preserve a charming unintellectual freshness. Krsna seems to me far from embodying an Hegelian principle that includes mutual contradictories. In general, while some of ZIMMER'S work is of value, his method, when applied indiscriminately, will be found cramping, except by members of the metaphysical school of myth-interpretation.2 Most scholars will favor the use of anthropology and history as well as metaphysics in dealing with myths, and will agree that much mythology, like poetry, springs from the heart without passing through channels of philosophical speculation.
