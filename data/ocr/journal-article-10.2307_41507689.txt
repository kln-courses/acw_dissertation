Magical gems are amulets created by carv- ing words or symbols into precious stones; most were made during the Roman Empire. Magical gems are compounds created by modern scholars in which a variety of beliefs can be recognized. These documents provide us with many interesting approaches, from the point of view of magical medicine, of linguistic features of magical words, of the merging of Graeco- Roman and Eastern iconographies, and so on. My purpose here is to use the iconographies and the texts about magical gems as documents to understand the most refined religious thought of Imperial Age theologists. During the Imperial Age, gems were often seen as tools used to cope with the problems of common daily life; for modern scholars they preserve elements of ancient theological and cosmological theories. Even the most banal problems were faced by appealing to the higher gods and using sophisticated divine names and iconographies. In several cases we know of these names and images only through magical gems. This small book gathers five studies on magical gems and religions of the Roman Empire. The first, second, and fifth chapters deal with topics that I have previously explored;1 but this volume presents texts and archae- ological evidence in a new way. The research on Shiva-Helios and Asklep- ios of Ascalon are the result of my studies of the magical gems in Italy and of those in the Cabinet des Medailles in France. I realize that this topic is very obscure and I will try to explain myself avoiding rare or unusual words. The varying degrees of reliability of my proposals will be clarified by my putting hypotheses in the footnotes and more plausible explanations in the text. I hope to offer some new perspectives on the intriguing, elusive, and intricate religious environments that existed during the Imperial Age in Egypt and the Near East. vii</page><page sequence="7">PREFACE I thank very much all the scholars who helped during my research and improved the results, in particular Pierre Amandry, Mathilde Avisseau Broustet, Silvana Balbi De Caro, Glen Bowersock, Christopher Faraone, Teresa Giove, Patricia A.

The compound of "magical gems" is the result of a modern choice, whereas antiquity did not know such a category. On the other hand, "amulets" (periammata, phylakteria) were known. Campbell Bonner entitled his very important handbook on this topic Studies in Magical Amulets .l He dealt also with bronze amulets of Late Antiquity and the Byzantine age, which are different from magical gems. In fact, amulets consisted mainly of pieces of papyrus or metal lamellae bearing prayers and other texts, as we can see by reading the recipes of magical papyri or Hippiatricae. The category of "magical gems" was conceived in the Counter-Reforma- tion intellectual environment to refer to iconographies of non-Olympian gods and odd images or inscriptions that appeared on carved gems. Scholars formulated various hypotheses.2 Pirro Ligorio (Naples, 1513/14-Ferrara, 1583), in his work II libro cinquantesimo dell'anticbita sopra delli signifi- cati dell'antichi intagli che si trovano con la imagine del scarabeo symbolo del sole, says that these gems were inspired by the cults of Helios and Asklepios, and that they were amulets used against disease; Cesare Baronio (Sora, 1538-Rome, 1607), in his Annates ecclesiastici (Rome, 1588-1607), interpreted these gems as evidence of Gnosticism. This point of view was shared by Abraham van Gorle3 (Antwerp, 1549- Delft, 1609) and Jean L'Heureux4 (Gravelines, mid-sixteenth century-Aire en Artois, 1614). L'Heureux was a follower of Francois de Foix de Candale, bishop of Aire, a passionate researcher on Hermeticism. Jean Chiflet5 (Besan^on, 1612-Tournay, 1666) recognized gnostic and mithraic influences within the iconography of these gems. Athanasius Kircher (Geisa by Fulda, 1602- Rome, 1680), Lorenzo Pignoria (Padua, 1571-?), and Bernard de Montfau- con (Aube, 1655-Paris, 1741) were looking to magical gems for evidence of Egyptian religion. In the century of Enlightenment, Luigi Bossi6 supposed that magical gems were the artifacts of magicians, tricksters, and charlatans. In the 1 C.

King.8 In 1914 Armand Delatte9 founded the modern approach to magical gems thanks to comparisons made with magical papyri, and credited the magicians of the Roman Empire, inspired by the Egyptian religion, with the production of texts and images of magical gems. Starting from this date magical papyri and magical gems were studied together; defixiones and magical lamellae were added to this corpus to create the documentation of Imperial Age magical arts. Modern scholarship has been satisfied with this grouping of docu- ments, which has been more or less accurately separated from texts and images that constitute what we regard as Classicity. In this way the Olym- pian gods were safe from contamination by magical iconography and texts. Adolf Furtwangler10 excluded these gems from his work Die antiken Gemmen and from the National Archaeological Museum of Berlin, in favor of placement in the Egyptological Museum. The British Museum entrusted these embarrassing gems to the Medieval Department. Ulrich von Wilamowitz never took into account the magical papyri, which were considered an inferior product of antiquity. In an about-face, during the middle of the twentieth century, Campbell Bonner and Alphonse Barb produced a series of seminal works in which they clarified the basis of the religious and theological speculation that underlay the iconographies and inscriptions of magical gems. These two authors recognized a plurality of religious streams that directed the engrav- ers of gems. They discerned traces not only of Egyptian and Greek religion, but also speculations on Judaism. Neither magical gems nor magical papyri and other types of magical documents were separated from ancient religions; on the contrary, they have to be held as precious evidence of religious streams that could not be classified as Olympic, classic, or Homeric. Neither were they evidence of true Egyptian or Jewish religions. Impurity, the contamination of what is deemed to be "a true religion" is the reason for singling out a magic document. One could also separate in the same way the theological works of Theurgy and Hermeticism, because they are inconsistent with Homer and Classicity. The magical papyri of the Anastasi collection, gathered from a find near Egyptian Thebes, are a sort of litmus test for us to judge what is 7 J.

In several recipes of those papyri the word "magic" is used to label a ritual or a religious attitude, but it is true that the owner of this library was interested in alchemy, theology, and literature.11 This library is also a testimony of new forms of Egyptian religion in Imperial times,12 in which the ancient local tradition was merged with the near-Eastern wisdom of the "Magi." The wisdom of these Magi was shaped in Persian or Jewish form.13 According to modern scholarship, Greco-Roman, that is, "classic" reli- gion was only that of Homer and Cicero, and not that of Porphyry and Julian the Apostate, and even less that of the Hermetic texts or Chaldaean oracles. Classicity14 stops when Oriental cults infect the Greco-Roman tradition. During the Roman Empire, the Jews and the Christians thought that the true Israel could not be where pagan or especially near-Eastern religious influences were present. The Christian apologists and heresiolo- gists labeled as "magic" the doctrines that they recognized as Christian heresies. This approach to non-Olympian religious traditions of the Imperial Age is embedded in the widespread opposition between magic and religion, which Christianity founded and first used against heretical Christians.15 These heresies were mostly labeled as Gnosticism, which is a variety of Christianity infected by paganism and especially by Oriental religious elements. In this book we will see that even characters of the ancient, classic Greek religion, such as Empousa, are present on the magical gems. Recent studies by Christopher Faraone have shown that many elements of Imperial Age magic arts were already present in Greek religion of the classical age. Hitherto the iconography of Empousa had not been recognized, neither was the iconography of Asklepios of Ascalon; consequently these iconographies had been labeled as "magical." In fact, they are characters of Attic religion and of a Palestinian pantheon, respectively. Our classification of these gems among the magical ones is not false, but only traditional. The god of Ascalon appeared odd, and because of that his gems became "magic." This is a tradition in the studies - a tradition that compels us to exclude 11 See G. Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes.

THEOLOGY ON MAGICAL GEMS Magical gems are very precious when attempting to understand particular religious speculations. We can recognize these speculations only when they are parallel to texts. These texts are found in the magical papyri or among the work of philosophers of Imperial times who were addicted to theology, astrology, and cosmology. In particular, many aspects of Kronos could be clarified thanks to magical gems. We will discover that this god was very important in theological multicultural speculations of Imperial times, and that believers resorted to him for love magic. His sexual features were the subject of important theological definitions, for example, the return to divine unity through the renunciation of sex. Kronos was he who generated many gods but finally gave up generation and resorted to con- templation of the supreme divine being. The opposition of procreation through sex and generation through contemplation of God were features of many doctrines, such as Gnosticism, and the solar religion of Neoplatonism (one can think of Julian the Apos- tate). The magical gems bear witness to these speculations; in fact we find on them the emasculated or hermaphroditic Kronos, the god who obtains knowledge by contemplating the supreme and perfect god. We find also a creator god who is contemplating the form of the supreme god. According to Plato, love causes the issue of the procreating substance when one sees Beauty. The famous discourse of Diotima in Plato's Banquet is as follows: Then love may be described generally as the love of the everlasting posses- sion of the good . . . what is the manner of the pursuit? What are they doing who show all this eagerness and heat which is called love?... I will teach you: The object which they have in view is birth in beauty, whether of body or, soul . . . All men are bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their souls. There is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreation - procreation which must be in beauty and not in deformity; and this procre- ation is the union of man and woman, and is a divine thing . . . Beauty, then, is the Moira or the Eileithyia who presides at birth, and therefore, when approaching beauty, the conceiving power is propitious, and diffusive, and benign, and begets and bears fruit . . . 16 See A. Mastrocinque, "Le gemme votive", in Artisanats antiques d'ltalie et de Gaule. Melanges offerts a Maria Francesca Buonaiuto, ed. J.-P.Brun, (Naples: Centre Jean Berard, 2009), 53-65. 6</page><page sequence="15">INTRODUCTION For love, Socrates ... is love of generation and of birth in beauty .... But why of generation? Because to the mortal creature, generation is a sort of eternity and immortality, and if, as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possession of the good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good: Wherefore love is of immortality.17 Plato is saying, through the words of the Delphic priestess Diotima, that Beauty produces the creative act, that is, the issue of semen. This statement was the starting point of a number of theological speculations of the Imperial Age. The main idea that firmly rooted itself was the idea that contemplation of the supreme god produced semen, which generated the most splendid and divine children. The figure of the creator god himself was shaped according to the theory of the contemplation of Beauty, that is, of god, for this god created when contemplating. Therefore, the creator, the Platonic Demiourgos, was believed to be inferior to the supreme god. There were several religious communities in which rituals were per- formed so as to attain contemplation of god and consequently to issue generative substances. Imitation of the creator god was a means of interfer- ing with a divine power, and producing a substance that bore sparks of supreme deities.18 Now we will see how Kronos, a cosmic god, gave up generation and preferred contemplating the supreme Beauty. The first chapter of this book will deal with the castration of Kronos and his transformation from a begetter of cosmic gods to an asexual divine being. According to Greek mythology, Ouranos was castrated by Kronos, but in many theological speculations of the Imperial Age it was Kronos who was castrated.19 For Kronos is described as &amp;paev60T)A,u&lt;;, "hermaphrodite," in the magical papyri.20 It is evident from many sources that Kronos was a very important god in many theological systems of the Imperial Age, but the reasons underlying this importance are still scarce, and in the following chapters we will try to discover some of these reasons. Kronos was also identified with important gods of other religions, such as the Jewish and the Egyptian ones; in fact, he was identified with Sabaoth 17 Plato, Symposium 206 A-207 A, B., The Dialogues of Plato, 4th ed., trans. B. Jowett, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953). Plato, Phaedrus 250 B also dealt with the beatitude of souls who were contemplating the world of Ideas before their descent into this world. 18 See A.D.

The gem is a round obsidian (Figure 1.1) from about the 2nd century CE, which represents, on the obverse side, Kronos holding a sword- sickle ( harpe ) in his left hand and a mysterious object in his right; a globe is placed on top of his head.

Paul Getty Museum, in Santa Monica (Figure 1.2), which bears a similar iconography. He has identified this god with the Alexandrian Kronos, who is represented on several coins of the 2nd century AD (Figure i Kyanides I, K 5, 3, ed.

Other images show Kronos holding the harpe in one hand and a small crocodile (Figure 1.4) or a gazelle in the other.6 On yet another specimen, in the Skoluda collection,7 he is clearly holding a crocodile (Figure 1.5). An obsidian in the Kelsey Museum in Ann Arbor8 shows the same god (Kronos; Figure 1.6 A) and, on the reverse side, Chnoubis in front of a fat pig (Figure 1.6B). This version of Kronos represents the Egyptian Suchos, the crocodile- god, who was especially revered in Krokodilonpolis. During the Hellenistic and Roman period, the god Suchos was often represented with the iconog- raphy of Kronos (see Figure 1.4). This Suchos-Kronos was revered in many Egyptian sanctuaries. In Tebtynis he was called LoKvejJrOvi^ 6 Kort 6 G. Dattari, Monete imperiali grecbe .

A small bronze statue of the god holding the crocodile is kept in the Archaeological Museum at Florence: Fr. W. von Bissing, Agyptiscke Kultbilder der Ptolemaier- und Rdmerzeit (Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1936), 27-8, fig. 17; this author thinks that it represents Kronos identified as Suchos, the crocodile-god, and he quotes the evidence of Pap.

Thanks to the research of L. Kdkosy, "Das Krokodil als Symbol der Ewigkeit und der Zeit", MDAI(K) 20, 1956, 116 ff. = Selected Papers (1956-73), Studia Aegyptiaca VII (Budapest: Archaeolingua, 1981), 113-118, part. 114, it has been clarified that in Egyptian culture the crocodile could represent Eternity; for this reason it was associated with Kronos, the god who was interpreted as time, chronos. Pseudo-Plutarchus, De fluviis 5.3 (where Cleanthes, the author of a work concerning the wars of gods, is quoted) narrates that Kronos, pursued by Zeus, transformed himself into a crocodile. The symbol of the gazelle could recall Seth, whose symbol was the oryx. The crocodile could also be a symbol of evil, and therefore could be linked to Seth. 7 S.

The god on the gem in Bologna may be associated with Egyptian doctrines, but he is also linked to Near-Eastern theological doctrines. The first book of the Lapidarium known as Kyranides (a stone book of the 4th century CE, collecting more ancient works attributed to Hermes Trismegistos and to Harpokration; the first book is called Kyranis) pres- ents, in alphabetical order, groups of one bird, one fish, one plant, and one stone whose names begin with the same letter. These groupings were supposed to share the same properties. This treatise had admittedly bor- rowed from Syrian10 and Babylonian traditions." Dealing with the letter "K" a stone named kinaidios, "cinaedus,"12 is presented, and the Kyranis (i.e., Kyranides' first book) says: "Although this stone is well known, the kinaidios is scarcely recognized; it is called obsidian and is the property of Kronos."13 After that the treatise14 explains how to make a magic gem: "You should engrave on the obsidian an emasculated man, having his sexual organs lying at his feet, his hands downward, and he himself looking 9 G.

He ascribes the 2nd and 3rd books to another later author. Moreover he noticed that the Kyranides were often dependent on the Physiologusy for Christian interpretations of natural phenomena are present in both treatises, but they have no meaning in the Kyranides. The Physiologus could be dated to about 200 AD. However, one must admit that no dependence on this Christian work is noticeable in Kyranides ' first book, which should be older than the others. Its organization has been traced back to the Seleucid Babylonian tradition and therefore suggests a more recent date, maybe the 1st century CE, of its first recension; see E.

In the Hellenistic and Roman world this ribbon became a diadem or a crown on Aphrodite's head that was decorated with many magical gems.16 The Kyrattis says that the gem of Kronos was endowed with the most terrible incantation. As we have seen, it is Kronos, not Ouranos, who was supposed to be castrated; the magical papyri define him as a "hermaphrodite." Additionally, the power of his gem fits well with his features according 15 Iliad , XIV, 214-217; this passage is very rich in myths that depended on Near-Eastern sources (Tethys and Okeanos were Hera and Zeus's parents; at first they loved each other, but later they divorced, in exactly the same way as Tiamat and Apsu, according to the Babylonian Enuma Elish ; moreover Aphrodite's leather ribbon is similar to Mesopotamian ribbons empowered by knots or also semi-precious stones to produce love incantations or to receive the favor of the gods). See C. A. Faraone, "Aphrodite's KESTOS and apples for Atalanta: Aphrodisiacs," Phoenix 44 (1990): 219-43; idem, Ancient Greek Love Magic (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1999), 97-110.

These beliefs were supported by a passage of Homer's Iliad17: I (scil. Hera) am faring to visit the limits of the all-nurturing earth, and Oceanus, from whom the gods are sprung, and mother Tethys, even them that lovingly nursed and cherished me in their halls, when they had taken me from Rhea, what time Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, thrust Cronos down to dwell beneath earth and the unresting sea. Them am I faring to visit, and will loose for them their endless strife, since now for a long time's space they hold aloof one from the other from the marriage-bed and from love, for that wrath hath come upon their hearts. The gem dates from the second century, and, in any case, no later than the third century AD. This is proof that in the middle years of the Imperial Age the topics of the Kyranis were well known. If we take a look at the Bologna gem, it is evident that Kronos is holding his genitals in his right hand.18 He holds his genitals on the gem in the Getty Museum as well. The Museum fur Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg contains a third gem (a green and brown/yellow stone) with Kronos's image.19 On this gem, the god stands over his hooked sword, the harpe, and holds the same object seen in the Bologna specimen. On the reverse side, the Sisisrd logos is legible and a small cynocephalic monkey riding the back of a lion is visible. Two yellow and green jaspers in the Skoluda collection (Hamburg)20 (Figures 1.7A and B) and in the J. Paul Getty Museum21 show Kronos and, on the other side, the monkey riding on the back of a lion, surrounded by the Sisisr6 logos. It is difficult to recognize what Kronos holds in these specimens. A green and yellow jasper kept in the Cabinet des Medailles22 (Figure 1.8) shows the same image - a monkey riding the lion; on the obverse side, the Sisisro logos suggests that the gem is of the same series, and that the god represented is Kronos. Here he resembles Harpokrates (i.e., Horus, the child); his right hand rests near his mouth. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that this is Kronos because a charakter supports him - a character similar to the hieroglyph that represents water.23 17 Homer, Iliad , XIV, 200-208, A.T.

Photograph by S. Michel, reprinted with her permission. The prayer in the fourth magical papyrus, which follows24 an appeal to "the snake, the lion, fire, water, and the tree," is devoted to Horus Harpokrates, the lord of the sun. The prayer to "the snake, the lion, fire, water, and the tree" is offered to Kronos, who is identified with the sea god Proteus, as we will see in the chapter devoted to the reverse side of the gem in Bologna. Kronos and Harpokrates were invoked in the same prayer. There is no contradiction in this: Harpokrates was the shape the sun took during the day, whereas Kronos-Osiris was its image at night. Evidently the author of the spell maintained that Kronos/Harpokrates was a single god with various shapes. This fact could help to explain the shape of the Kronos on the gems, who is making the gesture common to Harpokrates. The Egyptian Suchos-Kronos was worshipped with a similar and younger god.

In the Fayum, the perennity of kingship and the regeneration of the cosmos was fulfilled by two crocodiles, a young one and an aging one, deemed to be a form of Osiris born again as Horus, and of the evening sun regenerated during the night. These crocodiles clearly belong to two differ- ent generations: as Ra is often depicted as a child in the morning, as a mature grown up at its zenith, and as an old man in the evening, and as Osiris and Horus are father and son, I think the two faces of the god with a crocodile, beardless when young and bearded when aging, are not of the same age and refer to different moments of a common cycle. As a matter of fact, in Tebtynis, Soknebtynis, alias Kronos, shared his shrine with a younger crocodile, Sobek-Ra-Horakhty, and in Roman Soknopaiou 20</page><page sequence="28">METAMORPHOSES OF KRONOS ON A GEM IN BOLOGNA Figure 1.8A Green and yellow jasper in the Cabinet des Medailles, Paris, representing the Egyptian Kronos and a monkey riding on the back of a lion (photograph by the author).

Nesos, the two crocodile gods, Soknopaios and Soknopiai(i)s, were proba- bly a son and a father - the young one, Soknopaios, could be depicted as a hieracocephalous crocodile.25 Therefore, we deduce that this form of Kronos represents the younger god, similar to Horus. THE EMASCULATED KRONOS The Kyranides passage about obsidian as well as the doctrine that inspired the design of the Bologna gem, derive from speculations by Hellenistic 25 -Tallet, "Isis, the Crocodiles and the Mysteries of the Nile Floods," (quoted in n. 9) 149-50. 21</page><page sequence="29">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS Figure 1.8B Reverse side. Chaldaeans. In fact, a late cuneiform text26 ascribes to each zodiac sign a temple, a plant, and a stone. The "castrated one's stone" is attributed to Capricorn. According to ancient astrology, Kronos's "home" was in Capricorn.27 It is important to note that obsidian was the stone used for castration as well as for circumcision.28 26 E.

Pseudo-Plutarchus, de fluviis 10 describes a stone that was similar to iron, called machaira (sword); when it was found in the Marsyas river by men who performed the mysteries of Kybele, it made them go mad. Therefore it is possible that it was a stone with which they emasculated themselves. The same author, at $ 12, quotes the autoglyphos stone of the Sagaris river, which bore the image of Kybele. The Galli, who found it, always wore it. 22</page><page sequence="30">METAMORPHOSES OF KRONOS ON A GEM IN BOLOGNA Figure 1.9A Hematite in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, representing an emascu- lated god or priest lusted after by a goddess or a woman. Reprinted with permission of the Kunsthistorisches Museum. It is likely that a gem in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna29 (Figure 1.9) shows the scene that is described in the Kyrattis. It is a hematite on which one can see a standing man, wearing a tunic, possibly his hair is feminine; another person, probably a woman, is kneeling behind him. The inscription on the reverse side is certainly a love charm: NixapoicA.r|2; Sixortcaq, that is, "stimulate the favor! 30 With good reason!" It is unclear whether this man has his feet on the left or on the right side. A foot is visible on the side of the kneeling woman, but on the other side one could say that there are two slightly diverging feet. If we recognize in the gem the iconography alluded to in the Kyrattis, the diverging feet should be 29 E.

Paris: Imprimerie de 1'Institut Fran^ais, 1934-1937,) 131-36. This scene recalls the rituals of the Syrian temple of Bambyke-Hierapolis, where the castrated priests wore women's garments and were desired by women: Lucianus, De dea Syria 19-27; in particular, 22. The Christian writer Rufinus (Historia ecclesiastica II. 25) says that a priest of the Alexandrian Kronos convinced several women that the god wanted them to sleep in the temple; he appeared, disguised as Kronos, and had sexual intercourse with them. It is possible that this scarcely reliable account testifies to rituals similar to those of Bambyke. 23</page><page sequence="31">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS Figure 1.9B Reverse side. interpreted rather as the fallen genitals of the god. He is therefore looking at the genitals and turning his head back to despise the woman gazing at him. THE REVERSE SIDE Our attention now turns to the iconography on the reverse side of the Bologna gem, Figure 1.1B. Here a boar stands over a leontocephalic snake whose head is surrounded by rays, like Chnoubis. As I have already argued,31 this animal iconography represented the metamorphoses of Kronos. In fact, the Vatican Mythographer (an anonymous writer of a Vatican manuscript of mythology, in three books)32 reports that the head 31 Studi sul Mitraismo , 82-83, see n.283. This iconography had been formerly interpreted as that of Horus fighting with Seth (D. Wortmann, "Kosmogonie und Nilflut", Bonner Jahrbiicher 1 66 (1966): 91; cf. also C. Bonner, Studies in Magical Amulets Chiefly Graeco-Egyptian (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1950), 30-31; Ph. Derchain, "Intailles magiques du Musee de Numismat- ique d'Athenes," Chr. d'Eg. 39 (1964), 190. An interpretation of the castrated boar as Seth, the sterile god, could have been (if this is the case) only a secondary one. 32 Mythogr. Vatican. HI (1.8, 155-56), ed. Bode = F.

Carl Schmidt, 207) an evil god is described, whose head was that of a boar with the body of a lion. According to the diagram of the Ophites (in Origenes, Contra Celsum VI. 30), Michael was placed in the circle of Saturnus and had the form of a lion. 24</page><page sequence="32">METAMORPHOSES OF KRONOS ON A GEM IN BOLOGNA of Saturnus (the Latin name for Kronos) had different forms according to the seasons, namely, those of a snake, a lion, and a boar. Moreover, the sacred stone of Kronos was called "snake's stone." 33 On the other hand, the boar was the animal that killed both Adonis and Attis.34 Attis is the emasculated hero of the Phrygian mysteries. According to Ovid,35 Adonis had been castrated by a boar. Decans that have the form of Kronos were supposed to present the features of a boar.36 The identification of Kronos with the boar is reported in the great magical papyrus of Paris,37 where it is explained how to make a phylactery in order to force Kronos to give oracles. This phylactery bore the image of Zeus with the sickle; and was made of a rib of a castrated black boar, which was surely the image of Kronos. In the same instruction Kronos is appealed to as the hermaphrodite (&amp;poev60T|X.')&lt;;) and is attracted by the practitioner with salt, a product of the sea. Kronos delivered his oracles in the same manner used by Menelaos to attract and force Proteus to deliver oracular answers. We will discuss this type of divination in detail in chapter 2. Now we will discover why Kronos should be conceived as a boar. The use of the lion as an image for Kronos is more difficult to explain. However, monuments found in Roman Africa38 show Saturnus accompanied by a lion. Homer's Odyssey 39 tells the story of the capture of Proteus - the Old Man of the Sea. Proteus's daughter Eidothea explains that this hidden and omniscient god can transform himself into water or fire. When caught by 33 Kyranides 1. 10, 63 ed. Dimitris Kaimakis; Ps.

He says that it was translucent and was placed in the head of snakes, cf. Tertullianus, De cultu feminarum 1.6. According to Philostratus, Vita Apollonii III. 8, a stone in the head of snakes was bright with many colors (cf. Orphei, Lithika kerygmata , 49). It was used to make Gyge's ring, which gave invisibility to its owner (Plato, Respublica 359 B ff. and Phot., Lexikon , s.v. Kav8oa)Ax)D yuvT|).

A prayer to the sun in a spell found in the great magical Papyrus of Paris, which merges Egyptian and Jewish-Gnostic elements, is to be recited in front of the rising sun and later in front of a lamp; it begins thus: Hail, Snake and invincible lion, natural sources of fire. And hail, clear water and lofty-leafed tree!40 Identification between Kronos and a sea god41 is predictable because the Babylonian god Ea, god of sea water and of magic, was called "Kronos" by the Greeks; Marduk, on the other hand, was called "Zeus." According to the Peratae (a "Gnostic" sect), Kronos was identified with the biblical god; he was also a hermaphroditic god of watery substances.42 The Pytha- goreans believed the sea was formed out of Kronos's tears.43 The later Neoplatonists gave Kronos and his planet sovereignty over water.44 In the next chapter we will analyze the identification of Kronos with Osiris, who was another god of water, particularly of the flooding of the Nile. The multicultural magic used during the Imperial Age endorsed the myth of Proteus, as stated by Pliny the Elder45: "if, indeed, we are willing to grant that his [viz. Homer's] accounts of Proteus and of the songs of the Sirens are to be understood in this sense [viz. as evidence of magic arts]." The Gnostic sect of the Naassenes believed Proteus was the god who moved the heavenly pole. They identified him with the Phrygian god 40 PGM IV, 939-941; a quotation is to be singled out: 8ev8peov ityutÂ£TT|Ax)V: PGM IV, 941 = Homer, Odyssey , IV.458. 41 F.

To remind us of these identifications, the constellation of Draco (Latin for "snake") sits on the cosmic pole. In the mithraic mysteries the leontocephalic god Frugifer was worshipped;47 his head corresponds to that of the leontocephalic Aion, who is represented on the top of the cosmic globe in the fresco of the Barberini mithreum.48 His name, Frugifer, seems to correspond to Polykarpos. The leontocephalic god of Mithraism was also a hyperouranic god - he had features of Chronos (Time) and Herakles - whose cosmic manifestation was that of Kronos.49 The hermaphroditic nature of the highest god is a feature that occurs not only in Gnosticism and other doctrines followed during the Imperial Age. As we will see in chapter 3, hermaphrodism is also present in very different cultural environments, such as Indian or Egyptian religions.50 The god on the gem, moreover, is emasculated, not hermaphroditic. In the Greek Theogonies, Kronos was the father of many gods. Evidently his castration happened after his theogonic phase. The Naassenes applied the term arsendthelys, "hermaphrodite," to Attis, the emasculated god.51 Also it is possible that a complete refusal of sex was supposed to be equivalent to divine hermaphroditism, and that each religious stream thought of the refusal of sex by the old god differently. MANY FORMS OF KRONOS AND OF THE JEWISH GOD The reverse side of the Bologna gem shows a triple animal form of the god: a lion, a snake, and a boar. This triple nature is also seen on the gem 46 Hippolytus, Refutatio haeresium V.8.35. The Naassenes doctrines were often shared by the Peratae. On the other hand it is noteworthy that Simon Magus took Helene into the center of his doctrine. According to the Greek myth, Helene was related to Proteus and Menelaos. 47Arnobius, adversus nationes VI. 10: "Inter deos videmus vestros leottis torvissimam faciem mero oblitam minio et nomine frugifero nuncupari.

Vermaseren, Corpus inscriptionum et monumentorum religionis Mithriacae , II (The Hague: Niihoff, 1960), 390. 49 Just as Mithra was the hyperouranic sun, Helios was the cosmic one.

Paul Getty Museum. The gem combines the image of Kronos holding a harpe52 with the names 'Iaco Ca|3ad)0 'AScovoa, oi xpet&lt;; oi (leyaXoi. Perhaps these three names correspond to three forms or manifes- tations of Kronos. During the age of Tacitus, Saturnus (i.e., Kronos) was identified with the Jewish god.53 The Jewish god had three forms or features in addition to his own; Macrobius in fact reports a famous oracle of Apollo Klarios,54 who, when questioned about Iao's nature, replied: "You must know that Iao is the most great among the gods, who is Hades in winter, Zeus when spring comes, Helios in summer, and the mighty Iao in autumn." Three Hebrew names, Iao Sabaoth Adonai, correspond to three animal features: a snake, a lion, and a boar. The Jewish god as a snake and a lion was known to the Gnostic sects,55 especially in the compound form of Chnoumis (or Chnoubis), the lionheaded snake.56 Indeed, the snake and the lion merge into one form: Chnoubis. There is no specific reason for such an iconography on the gems of Kronos. The only possible explanation is that Chnoubis is considered to be lord of the Nile flood and of every watery substance.57 A gem depicts this god with the hieroglyph that signifies water;58 the same hieroglyph accompanies Harpokrates- Kronos on the gems in the Cabinet des Medailles (see Fig. 1.8). Pagan magi, as we have seen, shared the idea of a great god in the form of a lion and a snake: "Hail, Snake and invincible lion," was the prayer to the prophetic god.59 The bishop Epiphanius testifies60 that some Gnostic thinkers claimed that the Jewish god took the form of a pig. This strange belief does not depend on the famous prohibition of pork,61 but on the boar's feature of Kronos-Y ahweh.

The gems in Bologna, Hamburg, and Santa Monica suggest the value of identifying Kronos with the Jewish god.62 Varro, in the time of Caesar, wrote that the Chaldeans studied the nature of the Hebrew god in their secret writings.63 The Greeks and Romans wanted to identify such a myste- rious god with an Olympian god so as to understand his nature, and Kronos was featured in an appropriate manner for that identification. He had been removed from Olympus and confined in distant lands. A myth was told, according to which Kronos left Crete, after the victory of Zeus, and was followed by the Jews.64 This points to the idea that Kronos was the god of the Jews - proof of such an identification65 resided in the etymology of Sabaoth as the god of the number seven, sheba' in Hebrew.66 Consequently, the seventh planetary heaven, Saturnus, was that of Kronos- 62 On the importance of that identification, see A.

However, others say that it is an observance in honour of Saturn, either from the primitive elements of their faith which have been transmitted from the Idaei, who are said to have shared the flight of that God, and to have founded the race, or from the circumstance that of the seven stars which rule the destinies of men Saturn moves in the highest orbit and with the mightiest power, and that many of the heavenly bodies complete their revolutions and courses in multiples of seven." See also Origenes, Contra Celsum VL31 (Ialdabaoth has the form of a lion and a sympatheia with the Phainon planet, that is, with Saturn). 66 Jacoby, Der angebliche Eselkult, 268. John Lydus (de mensibus IV.38) writes: "The Chaldeans call Dionysos Iao, in Phoenician language (...); furthermore he is often called Sabaoth, because he is placed over the seven spheres; this signifies that he is the creator. Than he adds: "creator Sabaoth: this is indeed the name of the demiurgical number by the Phoenicians. " Commentaries of the Bible construe the name of Sabaoth as "week," or as "fullness," "completeness"; cf. Hieronymus, ad Jeremiam 5.24 [in Hebraeo enim scriptum est Sabaoth , quod pro ambiguitate verbi , et septimanas significat, et plenitudinem). Translations of the Bible by Aquila and Theodotion have: 7i^T|a|J.ova&lt;; ( =plenitudo , "completeness," "fullness"). Cf. also Lactantius, Institutiones VII. 14: hie est autem dies sabbati, qui lingua Hebraeorum a numero nomen accepit, unde septenarius numerus legitimus ac plenus est. If we take into account this concept of "fullness," we must remember that Sabaoth was identified as Kronos, and that Plato (Cratylus 396 B) suggested interpreting "Kronos" as koros nous , "full mind"; similarly St Augustine (De consolatio evangelica 1.23.35) defined Saturnus as satur nous , "full mind." On those ethymologies, cf. J.-G. Preaux, "Saturne a l'ouroboros", in Hommages a Waldemar Deonna , Collection Latomus 28 (Bruxelles: Latomus, 1957), 394-410, part. 397-403. 29</page><page sequence="37">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS Sabaoth.67 The seventh day of the week was considered sacred to Saturnus (Saturday, identified with Sabaoth) and corresponded to the Sabbat. The later Neoplatonist Damascius68 states that Pythagoreans and Phoe- nicians assigned to Kronos the number seven, which encapsulates unity and triplicity. Indeed, again we are faced with doctrines and speculations that were shared by Gnostic thinkers, magicians, and learned pagans. Similar cases are frequent. The gems testify to speculations on the asexual, hermaphroditic, and trifold nature of the Jewish god. One can remember the long disquisition of Hippolytos, in the fifth book of his Refutatio, on Naassene theories: To explain the mysterious sexuality of their supreme god, they resorted to the myths of Attis. It is evident that the iconography of the gems in Bologna, Hamburg, and Santa Monica trace back to Chaldean speculations on the Jewish god and speculations of Gnostic thinkers. Ploti- nus69 testified that Gnostic thinkers attended his school and that many of them persisted in their beliefs. Forms of cultural osmosis occurred between pagans and Gnostics. Nevertheless the iconography of Kronos and the comparison with the Kyranis leads one to assign the gem in Bologna to pagan environments.70 SARAPIS AND THE JEWISH GOD The identification of the Jewish god with Kronos runs parallel to Kronos's identification with Sarapis (i.e., the Hellenistic form of Osiris), a god whose image was often equated with Yahweh. In fact, Sarapis was invoked with names or formulae of the Jewish god. For example, we read beside him H&amp;yoc to bvojia xox&gt; Kupun) ZepaTuq (=Zepam6o&lt;;), or eii; Zetiq Eapamq &amp;yiov bvo|ia71 or "Yxjaoxo^ ZapaiCK;.72 Several gems represent Sarapis 67 In the Nature of Archons 95 (Coptic Gnostic Library , H.2, 255) Sabaoth refused the actions of his father Ialdabaoth, and therefore was shifted to the seventh heaven. Here, he obtained a power which was seven times greater than the Archons of the seven planetary heavens, and seven Archangels were recruited into his service. The Phariseans called the planet of Saturn aapeG (Epiphanius, Panarion XV.2; I, 211, ed. Karl Holl), a name which could easily be linked to Sabaoth. 68 Dubitationes 265, II, 131, ed. Ruelle (this work is commonly called also de principiis). 69 Enrteades II, 10, 125, ed. Brehier. 70 It is worth remembering that R. P. Casey, in "Naassenes and Ophites," Journal of Theological Studies 27 (1926): 374-87, part. 387, suggested searching at Hierapolis for the origin of the Naassene Gnostic movement. They were the worshippers of the snake, which was thought of as the image of Christ; according to Casey, from Naassene doctrine sprang the sects of the Peratae, the Sethians, and the Ophites. It is known that Naassenes greatly valued the myth of Attis and Magna Mater. 71 Respectively: Bonner, SMA, p. 322, D 398; Delatte-Derchain, no. 101; C. W.

He required all his subjects to be followers of this cult. The Jewish tradition claims that Ptolemy manifested his devotion to the god in Jerusalem.81 According to the Historia Augusta, 82 during the time of Hadrian Christians in Egypt venerated Sarapls. There are no valid reasons to claim that the Historia Augusta is wrong in this respect, since at the time of Hadrian the word "Christians" was also used to designate Gnostic Christians. In chapter 2 we will deal further with the identification of Sarapis or Osiris with Kronos.

Now we will attempt to explain the meaning of the spell inscribed on the Bologna gem and present comparisons with similar magical texts. The first words are Egyptian. Siopw (Sisr6) signifies "son of the ram." Ram, Â£pa&gt;, was the form of the sun during the sunset. Zep^ouG |iom opto were indeed the forms of the sun during the day: lotus, lion, ram. Three gods corresponded 35</page><page sequence="43">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS to these forms: Re, Khepri, Atum.94 However, Simone Michel95 correctly maintains that Sioi Zpco (Sisi Sro) are two Decans of Capricorn,96 and that Capricorn was Saturnus's astrological "home."97 We will address the astrological features of the gems of Kronos in the section "The Monkey on the Back of a Lion." Zapa%(0 occurs in a magical papyrus,98 where it is the name of the Ai6n always restored to life. Xvouoop ends with the name of Horus: Iftp. 'Apouip is Egyptian, and signifies "the great Horus." We notice again that the gem in the Cabinet des Medailles represents Kronos making the gesture of Harpokrates, that is, as a young god with his left forefinger in his mouth. Harouer is also a Decan in the Apocryphon of John 17." APpaoa^, or Abrasax, is the omnipresent divine name; its numerical value is 365. Ovodv is Egyptian, and signifies "the abyss." Bapixa|i(|j.)co is made up of Bari and Cham6. Bari was pronounced "Vari," and correseponded to Jari, the North- Arabian name of the moon, which was present also in the name of the emperor Heliogabalus: Varius.100 Cham6 is equivalent to Xaajioti, the Arabian name of Kore.101 94 M.-L.Ryhiner, "A propos des trigrammes pantheistes", Rev. d'Â£g. 29, (1977): 125-136; cf.

On another gem the same magical vox is inscribed close to the monogram of Christ.103 Gormakaiochlabar is a Decan in the Apocryphon of John 16.104 BaX, occurs on a gem with the "seal of Solomo" (i.e., a series of charakteres that were supposed to represent the name of god): EaParf&gt;6 BfjX, BaX,.105 Bf^X, BaX, and BoX, were names of the supreme heavenly god that were used at Palmyra.106 BeX,peX, is a Decan in the Testament of Solomo 18, and BaX.pr|X, is his name in the Apocryphon of John 16.107 As in the Egyptian defixio, other occurrences of the logos referred to a male and female divinity: the god of darkness and afterlife (Sarapis or Osiris, who is also called Eulamo, and Kronos), and the goddess of the dead (Brim6 and Hekate on the defixio). The aim of the defixio was to restrain anger, and a recent study by Christopher Faraone108 has shown that Kronos and the Titans were invoked in binding spells to restrain or dispel anger. To conclude this section, we can say that Kronos on the Bologna gem is a Near-Eastern god, who became the object of sophisticated theological speculation. This late-antique Kronos is a synthesis of several features of the Greek god, of the Egyptian Suchos-Kronos, of Yahweh, and of Osiris- Sarapls. He was meant to be emasculated and asexual. His realm is the remote region of the afterlife and of darkness, which is reflected in the dark color of the obsidian also used to represent him.

On the back of this lion stood the monkey, a symbol of Capricorn. Kronos was depicted in his astrological home, Capricorn, which corresponded to the winter solstice. The period represented by this Sign is one of long nights and cold temperatures, during which the sun is considered an aged god. So far we have reported the theory of Simone Michel. Now we take another step forward. Cassius Dio,123 when describing the vices of the emperor Heliogabalus (who was also allegedly called Sardanapalus), men- tions a strange ritual: I will not describe the barbaric chants which Sardanapalus, together with his mother and grandmother, chanted to Elagabalus, or the secret sacrifices that he offered to him, slaying boys and using charms, in fact actually shutting up alive in the god's temple a lion, a monkey, and a snake, and throwing in among them human genitals, and practising other unholy rites, while he invariably wore innumerable amulets. Cassius Dio, as well as the Historia Augusta , underlines the sexual extrava- gances of Heliogabalus, who, among his numerous oddities, behaved like an emasculated priest124 and planned to cut off his genitals altogether.125 The gems depicting an emasculated Kronos and a monkey on the back of a lion may have been inspired by the same doctrines that inspired the ritual of the emperor. This latter was born in Emesa, where Helios was worshipped. Moreover he could read the most secret Egyptian holy books; in fact Septimius Severus, in 199 AD, "took away from practically all the sanctuaries every book that he could find containing any secret lore."126 The doctrines of the great temple of Emesa could hardly contradict those of other religious centers or perhaps those of magical papyri. It is indeed possible that the sexual behavior of Heliogabalus suggests that he was aware of the theology of Kronos, the castrated or hermaphrodite god, and to his animal avatars. The belief that Kronos was emasculated was not shared by every prov- ince of the Roman Empire; it was typical of magical documents, which have no sure geographical roots. The emasculated gods were typical of 123 Cassius Dio LXXIX.11.3 (III, p. 464 Boissevain); transl.

Kronos with the crocodile was typical of Egypt, whereas Kronos with the boar was not Egyptian, but rather a Near- Eastern feature of his cult. In any case, these forms of mythology and the cults associated with it were not the product of the western, Latin regions of the empire. THE PURPOSE OF THE KRONOS GEMS The gems of Kronos were, or were also, love amulets. The specimen in Bologna was placed at the center of Aphrodite's crown and was supposed to be the most powerful love charm, for it could make a man change his sexual behavior. Also the recipe in PGM IV has been mentioned, in which a phylactery had to be used to threaten Kronos: it was a rib of a castrated black boar, engraved with the image of Zeus holding a sickle. Therefore a castrated black boar is an image associated with Kronos, and amulets created from black stones with Kronos's image could favor only an asexual life. A fragment from the philosopher Damascius indicates that the Chal- deans were able to make "chastity rings."127 We can only wonder whether such rings had something to do with the mythology of Kronos. A surprising fact is that a few transparent stones are engraved with the image of a male boar copulating with a wild sow128 (Figure 1.17). Appar- ently these gems represent the opposite of the Kronos black gems: intense heterosexual activity, fecundity, luminous gems, versus asexual behavior, disregard for female beings, sterility, black gems. In fact, boars and pigs are very fecund animals. The legend of Aeneas and the 30 piglets is a very famous example of this. In addition to the series engraved on black, green/yellow, and transpar- ent stones, there is another series, most often engraved on red or yellow jasper, which represents a boar holding a bull's head or something else in its mouth. The details of these gems are as follows: 1. The yellow jasper in the Numismatic Museum in Athens129 shows the boar with an unidentified object in its mouth and the inscription to Tnq &lt;|)iA,la&lt;; MOYIQP.

The gem representing the emasculated Kronos was placed at the center of Aphrodite's diadem and was supposed to be the most powerful love charm; the boar was depicted on gems of the same kind. The copulating boars were obviously linked to sex and reproduction, whereas the gems with this animal holding the head of another animal in its mouth were probably also connected with sexual and love affairs. 135 Michel, Die magischen Gemmen , p. 330, no. 48.2, plate 58.1 136 For example: AE (1962): 394; AE (2003): 249; AE (1990): 88; Caecin(i)ae Privatae; CIL II, 4048: Privat[a] Calpurnia Eutane; CIL HI, 2236: Aurelia Privata; CIL VI, 25059: Pribat(a)e. 47</page><page sequence="55">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS Figure 1.18B Reverse side.

The mummified Osiris is represented on a bed, at whose feet the donkey-headed Seth is standing. There is no doubt that he is Seth, who cut Osiris into pieces, and to whom magicians often resorted so as to threaten Osiris and force him to do things in the realm of the dead.1 This disquieting image is accompanied by the inscription: Xoape "Oaipi: "Hail, Osiris!" On the reverse side there are charakteres and two magical words: KoSripe and aa|A'|/OD%i0a. The bevel is also inscribed, but the stone is broken in many areas of the border and therefore it is impossible to read clearly. To understand this iconography it is beneficial to adduce the secret doctrines of Kronos, rather than the Egyptian myth of Osiris. In fact we know that Osiris and Kronos were often linked during the Imperial Age.2 Figure 2.1 A Obsidian in the Cabinet des Medailles, Paris, representing Seth and Osiris (identified with Kronos) (photograph by the author).

In the great magical papyrus of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris3 we find the following recipe: Oracle of Kronos in great demand, called "little mill": Take two measures of salt and grind with a handmill while saying the formula many times until the god appears to you. Do it at night in a place where grass grows. If while you are speaking you hear the heavy step of [someone] and a clatter of iron, the god is coming bound with chains, holding a sickle. But do not be frightened since you are protected by the phylactery that will be revealed to you. Be clothed with clean linen in the garb of a priest of Isis. Offer to the god moss of a tree together with a heart of a cat and horse manure. The formula to be spoken while you are mixing is this: Formula: "I call you, the great, holy, the one who created the whole inhabited world, against whom the transgression was committed by your own son, you whom Helios bound with adamantine fetters lest the universe be mixed together, you hermaphrodite, father of the thunderbolt, you who hold down those under the earth, aie o paidalis, phrenoteicheid6 stygardEs SANKLEON GENECHRONA KOIRAPSAI K&amp;UDEU THALAMNIA OCHOTA ANEDEI: 3 PGM IV, 3086-124; transl.

These are to be said while the salt is being ground. And the formula which compels him is: mkydobris kodÂ£rieus ankyrieus xant omoulis. * You say these things when he appears threateningly, in order that he might be subdued and speak about the things you ask. The phylactery in great demand for him [is]: On the rib of a young pig carve Zeus holding fast the sickle and this name: "CHTHOUMiLON." Or let it be the rib of a black, scaly, castrated boar.

Be gracious to us, lord. Among the magical words we note "Kerideu" - Kronos's secret name - which is also known thanks to other sources.4 Perhaps the vox Koderieus is related to kodere , which is one of the voces of a famous magical logos for Persephone. In this logos Persephone is identified with Ereschigal (queen of the realm of the dead, wife of Nergal in Mesopotamian mythology) and other goddesses of the night and the netherworld.5 The occurrence of Kerideu and Koderieus in the same spell leads us back to Kronos, leaving Osiris aside for a while. The second word on the gem, "Sampsychitha," is formed from the Greek name for marjoram, aa|Li'|/o')%o&lt;; ( sampsouchos ), which is, in fact, an Egyptian word: "herb of Souchos" (sm Sbk).6 It corresponds to Majorana hortensis.7 A passage of PGM XIII,8 copied from the Eighth book of Moses, quotes the series of seven incenses of the seven planetary gods: Kronos' own incense is styrax because it is heavy and fragrant; the one of Zeus is malabathon, Ares' is kostos, Helios' is incense, the one of Aphrodite is Indian spikenard, Hermes' is cassia and Selene's is myrrh. It is said that these pieces of information came from Manetho's book and that the Moses Key (i.e., a part of the Eighth book of Moses) gave further 4 PGM IV, 3105, cf. 3119. Cf. A. Mastrocinque, Studi sul Mitraismo (il Mitraismo e la magia) (Roma: Giorgio Bretschneider, 1998), 5-6 5 It is the Yessemigadon logos (e.g., PGM II, 35-38: Yessemigadon Ortho Baubo noere soire soire sankanthara Ereschigal sankiste dodekakiste akrourobore kodere: V, 423-6). 6 W. Vycichl, Dictionnaire itymologique de la langue copte (Leuven: Peeters, 1983), 189. Plinius, Naturalis historia XXI.61 says that the term was used by the Syrians and Egyptians. In Athenaeus XV. 18 the so-called "Naucratite wreath" is defined as one made of sampsouchos , a flower that was abundant in Egypt. 7 A.C.

Furthermore, the papyrus mentions incenses and flowers of the seven planets. However, the order in which they are mentioned does not correspond to any planetary order that we know. It is possible that the quotation was not very accurate, for the practitioner had to use the seven substances all together. In this case marjoram is quoted in the first place. 55</page><page sequence="61">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS information. After that the papyrus continues by saying: "Take the seven flowers of seven stars that are the following: marjoram, white lily, lotus, herephyllinon, narcissus, white pansy and rose." Therefore we have the following series: Kronos Zeus Ares Helios Aphrodite Hermes Selene styrax malabathron kostos incense spikenard cassia myrrh marjoram white lily lotus herephyllinon narcissus white pansy rose The planetary order is the canonical one for Imperial times. The same order was also used to assign a single vowel to each planetary god, by shifting the tones from the highest of Selene: E, to arrive at the lowest of Kronos: O.9 The name Sampsouchitha seems to be an adjective that depicts Kronos as the god of marjoram.10 Yet, the obverse side of the gem shows Osiris, not Kronos. This Egyptian god lived in a sort of sleep. He was living, but living in the realm of the dead, wrapped in his bandages. The codices of Dioscorides" report the Egyptian names of marjoram: yovoc, c'Oovpedx;, or onoyovoi; "Ioeox;: "generation of Osiris," "similar generation of Isis." In Imperial times there was a widespread belief that Kronos was sleeping forever in a place where Zeus had confined him as a prisoner. The chains were an iconographical feature proper to this aged god, as we have seen in the "Mill of Kronos" recipe. In addition, the sleeping Kronos was also described in fragments of Orphic works, which have been carefully analyzed by Jan Waszink.12 Let us examine the most important among them. An extract of an Orphic poem13 affirms that Kronos, after eating a deceptive food, fell asleep. Another fragment14 says that Nyx the goddess of night suggested to Zeus 9 Cf. Mastrocinque, Studi sul Mitraismo , 8. In the astrological treatises that assign a plant to each planetary god marjoram is never listed; sage or asphodel is assigned to Kronos: A.

In this way Zeus was able to emasculate him. Other fragments speak of Kronos's revelations. One of those extracts asserts that Nyx was feeding Kronos,15 and giving advice to Zeus during his work of creation.16 As claimed by another fragment,17 Zeus, when he was creating the world, went to consult the oracle of Nyx and also asked for Kronos's help. Another fragment observes that Zeus liberated his father from fetters and was seeking his benevolence; furthermore he got Nyx's oracles, and Kronos gave him helpful directions when he was creating.18 Proclos the Neoplatonist describes those fragments (that we have just referred to) in his Commentary on Plato's Republic, Kratylos, and Timaeus. He gives the following interpretation of those Orphic myths19: Zeus was imitating Kronos, and during his sleep he was lifted to the noetic world, that is, to the world of Ideas.20 He also gained inspiration from the revelations of Kronos when he was accomplishing the creation. In the opinion of Proclos, Kronos transmitted the principles of intelligible truth, that is, of the Platonic Ideas. According to a Hermetic treatise,21 "the sight of Good does not damage, but fills one with all immortality, and therefore those who can reach a part of this sight, fall asleep, relinquish their body and often reach the most beautiful vision, as it happened to Ouranos and Kronos, our ancestors." According to Waszink,22 Kronos unveiled what he saw in his dream by speaking in his sleep. A passage of Plutarch's de facie in orbe Lunae 23 suggests such an explanation. This author says that Zeus made Kronos fall asleep; the latter was in a rocky cave, on an island, and birds fed him with ambrosia; gods and humans took care of him and he gave many oracular answers. Indeed his oracles were revelations of his dreams. More precisely,24 Plutarch maintains that Kronos knew Zeus's thoughts, and, when dreaming, he communicated these thoughts to demons who were 15 Bernabe, 182. 16 Bernabe, 237. 17 Bernabe. 237. 18 Bernabe, 239. 19 Or he takes it over from other Neoplatonic philosophers. 20 Procl., in Tim. 135, 28 ff.; 138, 15 ff.

This passage has been interpreted as if Kronos, thanks to his dreams, suggested to Zeus the fundamental laws of creation, or as if Zeus's forethoughts conditioned the dreams of Kronos; cf. L. Albanese, "Saturno nei misteri di Mithra", SMSR 67 (2001): 63-64. 24 Cf. H.

Thus the humans could know Zeus's thoughts through the demons. Tertullian25 alludes to the Kronos (or Saturnus) dream and claims that Kronos was the first to dream in this world; in addition, Tertullian asks Aristotle to forgive him for laughing at this myth. It is evident that Aristotle dealt with this topic in one of his lost dialogues, maybe in the Protrepticus,26 or in the De anima sive Eudemus ,27 which is perhaps to be identified with the Protrepticus .28 ORACULAR OSIRIS AND THREATENING SETH The obsidian gem's iconography could be interpreted as a portrayal of Seth forcing the sleeping Osiris to reveal his oracles. Seth was indeed a threat to Osiris, who was forced to reveal what he was seeing in his dreams. The shift from Kronos to Osiris is proven by the means that were used to force the oracular god to act, according to the "little mill." This recipe of the magical papyrus does indeed describe the constricting spells used to overcome Kronos. It is said that Zeus used violence against Kronos and that Helios put Kronos in chains. The performer of the ritual should say that it was he who revolted against Kronos, therefore he identified himself with Zeus. Admittedly, the gems could indeed be used in rituals that were supposed to provide the practitioner with prophetic dreams, in which a god,29 and especially Sarapis,30 appeared. Sarapis31 was the Hellenistic form of Osiris and was supposed to give oracles and send dream visions. Moreover Bes, that is, a sort of Osiris as a child, was forced to appear in the night to deliver oracles or do favors.32 The gem in the Cabinet des Medailles represents Osiris, but its features recall Kronos. Obsidian was a stone from which amulets of Kronos were carved, and in the first chapter many of these obsidian gems have been taken 25 De anima 46.10. 26 J. H. Waszink, "Traces of Aristotle's Lost Dialogues in Tertullian," Vig Chr 1, (1947): 137-49. The reason for the attribution to this work is not strong: Iamblichus, in his Protrepticus , spoke of Kronos on the Blessed island; cf. I. During, Aristoteles ' Protrepticus.

We have also spoken of the iconography of the Alexandrian Kronos, who was the Greek form of the Egyptian god Souchos, the croco- dile-god of the Fayum. Kronos was holding a little crocodile and a sickle. The adjective sampsouchitha, as we have said, comes from the name "herb of Souchos." Additionally, the crocodile could be seen as a symbol of eternity.33 According to Pseudo-Plutarch's De fluviis ,34 Kronos transformed himself into a crocodile to escape from Zeus. The multiformity of Kronos was a feature that was often highlighted by theologists during Imperial times. Cornutus,35 the theologist, writes: "the nature of the cosmos - which was precisely called Zeus - became strong and stopped the tranformations of he who moved too much." According to the Vatican Mythographer,36 Saturnus's head took the forms of a snake, a lion, and a boar, depending on the seasons. In the first chapter we also saw the identification of Kronos with Proteus, the sea god who assumed different shapes to avoid answering questions. He had to be forced to stop his metamorphoses and made to answer. Christopher Faraone37 has recently shown that Kronos and the Titans were invoked in magical performances because they were the most ancient living beings in the world - the first ancestors. They were supposed to live in the realm of the dead in a remote land. These features may complete the identification of Kronos with Osiris. One will note that in magical texts of the Imperial Age, Hades is scarcely mentioned. On the gems he is totally absent. In the defixiones from Egypt or those that are heavily influenced by Egyptian ideas, Hades is usually replaced by Osiris as the god of the dead. OFFERING MOSS, A CAT'S HEART, AND HORSE MANURE The performer of the "little mill" had to offer Kronos many odd things, according to the magical papyrus. The offering of horse manure seems 33 L.

Here Faraone writes: "Kronos and the Titans (...) are invoked in binding spells to restrain or send away anger, and Kronos alone appears in a divination spell that closely recalls contemporary necromantic spells. In what follows, then, I shall show how the defeated Kronos and the Titans evolve quite early on from the 'bad guys' of theogonic poetry to become chthonic agents of anger control and necromancy and how their theogonic prehistory plays into their later roles. " 59</page><page sequence="65">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS blasphemous. The horse clearly recalls the equine nature of Seth. He was often represented with a donkey's head. By offering such a substance, the performer takes on the behavior of Seth. He was showing contempt for Kronos, who should react as Osiris had done, and submit himself to Seth.38 Donkey manure or urine was still used in the Middle Ages in Jewish magic to aid childbirth.39 We know that Seth was the god who opened the womb,40 and therefore he could favor the delivery. In addition to manure, the performer of the ritual offered salt, moss of a tree, a cat's heart, and was protected by the rib of a pig or a boar. A recipe in the ninth magical papyrus41 explains how to prepare an amulet to subdue and to silence; in the invocation to an unknown god the practitioner says: "Bring into subjection ... for you have put beneath my feet, like my robe, the heart of Sabaoth." The logos, which has to be written on the reverse side, is E(&gt;Axx|ia&gt; ai(TipPPair|p aeai^epixoi) XvoDcop Appaoa^. The heart of a cat could replace a lion's heart, which was extremely difficult to have at one's disposal. One will also notice that the performer offered horse's, not donkey's, manure. Maybe the former was more easily available and totally identical to the latter. Also the offering of moss, instead of wood, or boughs of a tree, had meaning. Maybe it alluded to an old tree. The use of the rib of a pig or a boar shows the existence of two forms of the ritual, or even of two preexisting recipes. The rib of an old, black castrated boar was a proof of the killing of Kronos's animal avatar, whereas the rib of the pig was a less precise allusion. If we accept these substitutions, we get this series: salt, tree, lion, pig/ boar. In the first chapter we took into account the passage of the great magical Papyrus of Paris, where the god is adressed with these words: "Hail, Snake and invincible lion, natural sources of fire. And hail, clear water and lofty-leafed tree!"42 In this magical and oracular performance the practitioner acted as if he were Menelaus forcing Proteus to deliver his oracle.

Menelaus attracted Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea, with sealskin. In a similar way the performer of the "little mill" attracted Kronos by means of milled salt, for this god was the lord of seawater. It is worth mentioning another recipe, which is also reported in the great magical papyrus of Paris.44 It is that of Nephotes to Psammetichos, king of Egypt. Here the practitioner, wrapped like a corpse, invokes Typhon (i.e., Seth) until a divine sea falcon appears. Thanks to other prayers, the practitioner acquires a divine nature and can begin a request for bowl divination and necromancy and address whatever god or dead man he wants. At the end he dismisses the requested god by pronouncing the most terrible name of Typhon. Here we find again the magician who is resorting to using Seth to force Osiris, or another god or a dead man, to deliver an oracle or to do something. One should note that all the gods are supposed to obey Seth. The famous curse tablets from Porta San Sebastiano, known as Sethian lamellae, bear texts in which Seth is appealed to and also depicted as a horse-headed god, used to force Osiris, also called Eulamd ("eternity"), to subdue a ghost and make him obey the practitioner.45 HIDDEN AND BLACK Osiris was also the lord of water, according to Greek theology, and espe- cially Plutarch's De Iside et Osiride, chapters 33, 39. This influence over water also appears in Egyptian theology, which supposed that the flooding of the Nile was caused by the sweating mummy of Osiris.46 The Egyptian god produced fresh water, whereas saltwater was the domain of Seth, the god of sterility.47 In direct opposition to Seth, Osiris brought fertility. Perhaps this issue of fertility is not an unsurmountable difference between the Greek Kronos and the Egyptian Osiris, which could prevent theologists from identifying them. Both were forcefully removed from their realms and confined to the realm of the dead. Both were hidden. Both were living Â« PGM IV, 154-260; transl. N. O'Neil. See A.

Both were threatened by a mighty god: one by Zeus and the other by Seth. Both were supposed to reveal the hidden truth they learned in their dreams. Gems that depicted them were always carved on black, often obsidian, stone. In case all this proof is insufficient, the existence of a Roman statue might be more persuasive. The statue includes a famous family grouping that is kept in the Vatican museum, and depicts a father as Kronos and a son as Harpokrates, that is, as Osiris's son (Figure 2.2).48 It is possible that this monument is of funerary character and that the deceased, that is, he to whom the monument is dedicated, namely, Cornutus - is portrayed as Kronos-Saturnus. Further evidence exists in the form of coins: Several coins of the Tet- rarchic period,49 issued in honor of deceased emperors ( consecratio issues), show the bust of the deified emperors with their heads covered by the flap of the toga (Figure 2.3). The toga was not the clothing of the Pontifex Maximus, for these emperors were deceased and there was already a new Pontifex Maximus. Rather, this was the clothing of Kronos-Saturnus. In Egypt an ancient custom allowed the deceased to be identified with Osiris, and probably Kronos was the god with whom deified men were similarly identified in the Hellenistic and Roman iconographical tradition. The coin of Gallienus in Figure 2.4 proves that Kronos became a god of Aeternity, like Osiris and the divinized emperors. The gem in the Cabinet des Medailles was previously kept in the collec- tion of Henry Seyrig, who bought it in Aleppo. Therefore, it is probable that the gem was cut in Syria and not in Egypt. Its iconography does not depend on true, sacerdotal Egyptian tradition, but on Hellenistic theology. Sophisticated Near-Eastern speculation used Egyptian iconography to rep- resent Kronos. Also many practitioners of the magical recipes were required to be clothed as Egyptian priests. In the same way Kronos was clothed and featured as Osiris. This Kronos was not, or not only, the Hesiodic god, but was first of all the result of a philosophical and theological refashioning of a Near-Eastern god by Magi or Chaldeans. 48 H.

My purpose in this chapter is to show that this god was conceived by a very sophisticated theologist of the 3rd century CE, who was able to merge the Egyptian form of the sun (Harpokrates) with the Indian Brahmanic iconography of an androgynous Shiva. This god is accompanied by a series of symbols and by an animal-headed creator god, who looks to him during his creative activity. The description of the carved figures is as follows: A naked pantheistic god, who may be named Helios, is standing on a prostrate human corpse. He is viewed from the front, the form of his sex is not precisely recognizable; his arms are slightly opened on both sides. His head is surrounded by 12 large rays, between which the word XAPXENAABPAH can be read. A thin animal skin, its legs hanging down on its right side, covers his chest. With his left hand he is holding a herald staff or caduceus under which an oval object with two points can be seen. The latter could be the bag of Pan, as it is shown in another gem.2 The god's right hand is holding a strange long scepter, composed of a vegetal staff interrupted in the middle part by two little globes and ending with a branch (palm?) and a compound of globes. Perhaps this is a sort of thyrsos. On the left side of the gem a small animal- headed god is standing and looking up toward Helios. His head could be that of a dog or a wolf. He is ithyphallic, holding a whip and a double axe. On the right side a winged thunderbolt and a snake can be seen. The Greek inscriptions on this gem read as follows: On the reverse side: ZEME2EIAANE MIXAHA AXEACO IOY IOY IOY; on the lower part: AKIPQKOMA On the bevel: [ ca. 6 ] COAIABAANAeANAABPEMCONY^IMEACOfflAO) [ ca. 4-5 ] 2ESEN[BAPOAP]ANTHSAPEENOÂ©HBAKPAMMAXAMAPEI AYBIAIOI ABPA[ . . . 1 U.

Here the seven planetary gods are depicted in a mixed Graeco-Egyptian form, and Jupiter has the guise of Re-Atum, the Egyptian creator god identified with the Sun, holding a whip while masturbating.10 The creator god's animal form is often described in the Gnostic trea- tises.11 He has a lion's head and his name is Ialdabaoth.

In the case of the gem in Naples the creator god does not correspond to the solar god, but he is inferior to him.

The god has the symbols of Helios (the rays), of Hermes (the herald's staff), perhaps of Pan (the bag?), Dionysos (the thyrsos? the animal's skin?), and Heracles (the animal's skin?). He is therefore a pantheistic divinity. In late antiquity Dionysos was identified with the Sun god.15 In the aretalogy on a third-century inscription from Chalcis16 Harpokrates 13 Michel, British Museum , no. 107.

HELIOS-SHIVA 73</page><page sequence="78">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS is identified with Helios, Apollo, Dionysos and is recognized as the higher god, lord of the cosmos. Compound divinities with solar features are known from the age of the late Roman republic.17 They were conceived to represent a lord of the cosmos, a god who was mightier than the other gods. Usually, compound divine features were given to the divinities of destiny, such as Tyche, or to the hypercosmic Sun, which is depicted in the Hymn to King Helios by Julian the Apostate. The theme of the snake occurs in many religious traditions of the Roman period and accompanies the birth of Harpokrates, as we have seen, and of Mithra. Furthermore, the thunderbolt is such a common symbol that one can obtain no precise information about the nature of the god from it. The most important feature of this god is the hermaphroditism. The inscription says that he is a hermaphrodite (arsenothelys) and his image shows an incomplete male sexual apparatus, the large flanks and slim waist of a woman. His left breast is prominent. The most important and mighty divinities of late antiquity were thought to be hermaphrodites,18 for they were complete in their perfect unity. In several theological systems two almighty gods were conceived: one young and one elder,19 and they could be hermaphrodites or have no sex at all. This was the case of Kronos, who was thought to be an emasculated god, was prayed to as the hermaphrodite god, and names of male and female divinities were used to adjure him.20 During the Imperial Age, the theme of divine hermaph- roditism was developed in Egyptian and Gnostic theologies.21 Dionysos was said to be a hermaphrodite.22 The disguise of Herakles as a woman is typical of the Omphale myth, and was also present in Roman rituality,23 17 M.H.

According to the Apocrypbon of John,27 the first son or daughter of the supreme god was the bisexual Barbelo; according to the Origin of the World 28 and perhaps the Nature of the Archons,29 the Archons too were bisexual as was their father, the young god Ialdabaoth, and they had both a masculine and a feminine name. In Gnostic theology, sex and separation between male and female genders were among the later steps in the process of creation, whereas paganism kept separate the genders of important cosmic gods, such as Venus and Mars. The theologists who inspired the engraved gem, and who spoke of a god copulating in the ocean,30 placed the creator god in a higher place in the pantheon hierarchy and gave him a masculine character. The same can be said of the Egyptian myth of Atum. In the Imperial Age an ancient Egyptian pantheistic god was often represented as the creator, who had many animal, vegetal, and human features. He was ithyphallic and all the forms in the world derived from his forms; he was the first father.31 24 Lydus, de mensibus IV. 67.

Suffice to say that this is an important feature of several theological streams of the Roman empire. CREATION AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE PERFECT GOD Plato32 said that love produces emissions of a generative substance (semen) thanks to the vision of Beauty, and he interpreted the name of Ouranos as "contemplation of the higher world" (horosa ta and).33 The emperor Julian34 said that "For when the generative substance which is visible in our world desires to beget in the Beautiful and to bring forth offspring, it is further necessary that it should be guided by the substance that, in the region of intelligible beauty, does this very thing eternally and always." Proclus35 maintains that Kronos could have the beatifying vision described by Socrates. The 10th treatise of the Corpus Hermeticum says: the vision of the Good . . . not only does come more swiftly down to us, but it does us no harm, and is instinct with all immortal life. They who are able to obtain more of this Sight, often fall asleep and from out of the body see the fairest of Visions, just like it happened to Ouranus and Kronos, our ancestors.36 As we saw in the second chapter, Waszink37 focused on a series of Orphic fragments, from which it is possible for us to understand that during Zeus's creative activity, Kronos, kept in a cave and asleep, had many dreams and visions of the metaphysical hyperouranic realms. There- fore Zeus could obtain higher directions so as to create the world cor- rectly.38 These fragments are sometimes obscure, among other things, they merge Orphic and Neoplatonic ideas.

Pagan thinkers were of the same opinion.43 Some Gnostic theologists main- tained that the divine Wisdom - called Achamot - created while con- templating the Savior's angels.44 Valentinus said that the divine Mother produced Jesus by thinking of the most sublime things.45 The devotees of Barbelo said that Ialdabaoth contemplated the material substance and created Nous, a snake-like divine being, and then he listened to his mother's voice and created Man.46 According to other traditions, the Archons once saw a bright image in the sky and created Man;47 and again, Divine Providence (Pronoia) saw the perfect angel in the sky, the heavenly Adam, and let flow toward the earth a few rays of her own light, from which Adam was born;48 or, according to other authors, Adam was born from the fallen semen of Archons.49 The doctrine of the Peratae speculated a lot about contemplation and generation through the body's different organs.50 One can stop here with the topic of contemplation and creation or generation in different religious streams of the Roman Empire, because it is clear enough that the creator god took inspiration from the contempla- tion of the supreme god, or from the supreme and unified manifestation 40 Tertullianus, De anima 46.10 says that perhaps Aristotle dealt with the dreaming Saturnus (i.e., Kronos), in his Protrepticus (Waszink, "Traces of Aristotle's Lost Dialogues in Tertullian"), or rather in the de anima sive Eudemus [A.P.

This manifestation often had a human form, it was the Anthropos, a sort of Platonic ideal of Man,51 the perfect man, in which male and female were unified. On the other hand, the Egyptian polymorphic creator god (an example is shown in Figure 3.6) did not contemplate, but engen- dered from himself the beings, which reproduced the forms of himself. Gnostic thought also conceived a statue representing the Anthropos. The Naassenes referred to Chaldean doctrines, according to which the 51 Plato, Respublica VI. 506 D-508 C first said that the supreme god, the Good, manifested himself in the sun. It is perhaps worth mentioning a passage of Epiphanius, Panarion XXVI.3.1 (I, 278, ed. Karl Holl), which reports that the Gospel of Eve described a vision in which a tall heavenly figure, accompanied by another person of small stature, appeared. A link between these two figures and those on the Naples gem is possible, although completely hypothetical. 78</page><page sequence="83">HELIOS-SHIVA Anthropos, or Adam, was begotten forth by the Earth. He was inanimate like a statue, and represented an image of the divine being, who is above, who was celebrated as Adamas.52 INDIAN SHIVAITE INFLUENCES ON NEOPLATONIC THEOLOGY When I first saw the gem in Naples, I had the impression that the style of Helios's image was not Greek, but rather Indian. The movement of his hip, the frontality, and the sensual rendering of the body recalled Indian statuary. My impression was, in fact, correct. In a fragment of Porphyry, from his treatise on Styges's water, we read: The Indians53 who lived in Syria under the reign of the Emesene Antonine54 had a discussion with the Mesopotamian Bardisanes, and related, as Bardi- sanes wrote, the following things . . . They also said that there is a natural big cave, in a big mountain, almost in the middle of the Earth. In this cave there is a statue whose height was estimated to be twelve cubiti. It is standing, with opened arms,55in the form of a cross. The right part of his face is masculine and the left feminine. Moreover, in the same way, the right arm and foot and all this half of the body is masculine while the left part is feminine. One is astonished, therefore, when this mix is seen and one could ask how it is possible to see this diversity of the two parts in one body. It is said that on that statue the sun is carved around the right breast, and the moon around the left, and on the arms . . . .56 In an artistic fashion a number of angels and whatever it is that exists in this world are sculpted, namely the sky, mountains, seas, rivers, oceans, plants, animals and, in short, all the existing things. It is said that God gave this statue to the Son when this latter was creating the world for he had to see a model (in order to create it).57 The tale of the Brahmans, led by Sandales, continues by describing other features of this statue and of the cave. The account was found by Porphyry in the book on India by Bardesanes. The most important thing is that Greek and Syrian theologians knew the form of the Indian androgynous god, after which creation was made. We now have the archaeological 52 Hippolytus, Refutatio haeresium V.7.5-6. 53 From other passages it becomes clear that they were Brahmans. 54 Heliogabalus. 55 Or hands: cheiras: cf.

The gem in the Archaeological Museum in Naples is sound evidence of theological speculation by wise men of the Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, which takes into account Indian religious ideas. This fact suggests an origination date for the gem in the 3rd century CE, the century of Bardesanes and Porphyry. It was the period of Heliogab- alus, the emperor who identified himself with the solar god of Hemesa and sometimes appeared in female disguise.58 The statue described by the Brahmans to Bardesanes corresponds to Indian statues of an androgynous form of Shiva, Ardhanarisvara. Excellent investigations on Indian models of Bardesanes and Porphyry's description have recently been made by Joachim Lacrosse59 and Cristiano Castelletti,60 although the identification of the model with Ardhanarisvara was first proposed by von Schlegel 61 and accepted by many scholars. Ardhanaris- vara means ardha nan iivara : "Lord half woman"62 and represents an iconographic and theological development of Shiva joined to his Shakti (that is, his female counterpart), Parvatl.63 The couple expresses divine unity and the generative force. The first evidence of this iconography dates back to the 2nd century C.E. and the first sculpture of Ardhanarisvara dates from the end of the 2nd century.64 Images of this god (Figure 3.7) were very popular and nowadays they are among the preferred forms of Shiva. They are often abundant in symbols, which characterize the male and the female parts. Two statues are especially interesting and clear in depicting these symbols, one stone relief from Abaneri (Gujara - Pratibara), 58 Cf. a recent book by S.

The left female half wears bracelets and ankle rings, bracelets on hands and feet, and is holding a mirror or a lotus stem. The male half is holding a weapon in the form of a trident with ondulate prongs, the tridula; he wears a tiger skin and is adorned by a skull or a snake.69 The iconography of the Indian hermaphroditic god is repeated in this small theological treatise carved on the gem. The snake and the animal's skin, maybe the lotus stem too, are also present on the intaglio; the trident has been transformed into the caduceus of the herald god. Other symbols, missing in the Indian models, have been added: the corpse, the thunderbolt, the bag of Pan, and, above all, the animal-headed creator god. This god does not occur in the Indian Ardhanarisvara's iconography, but occurs in the Brahmans' interview with Bardesanes. In Indian art it appears that Shakti is embraced by Shiva and is looking up to him; this attitude symbol- ized the beginning of creation.70 But we will also see that the creator was present in Indian literature of the Imperial Age. The idea of creating as copying after a model is a Platonic one. According to Platonism, everything on the Earth is an imitation of a divine and perfect model. Indian theology gives to Ardhanarisvara or to the couple Shiva- Parvatl the function of creating. Nevertheless it is true that several images of Ardhanarisvara represent him accompanied by a number of symbols and deities that symbolize the cosmic reality. The idea of condensing everything in the divine unity is a feature of demiurgical gods in several theological systems of the Imperial Age. The Egyptian Pantheos - or poly- morphic Bes - is one divinity of this kind. The doctrines alluded to in Bardesanes and Porphyry recur in the Up- anishads, that is, in Indian treatises that were known in Imperial times, and not only in India. According to the Upanishads, the divine unity is 65 C. Sivaramamurti.

According to the Svetasvara Upanishad , Brahman cannot be viewed as a cause. For this reason, Brahman, when acting in this world, manifests itself as Brahman Isvara, the Lord, the principle of creation. Isvara is therefore the creator. Isvara is Brahman who has a form and creates every form. Brahman is formless; Isvara has a form and could establish a relation between Brahman and the world. The Upanisbads know one specific creator-god, called Brahma or Hiranya-garbha, which is the World-Soul. He is not clearly distinguished from Isvara. Brahman, Isvara, and Hiranya-garbha are the foundations of the manifested world.71 The Maitrt-Upanishad maintains that Brahman has two aspects, the form- less and the formed. The formed is caused by the formless. Brahman is light and that which is light is sun (Maitrl - Upanishad VI.3). Therefore the Brahmanic doctrines spoken of in Bardesanes were rooted in the theol- ogy of the Upanishads. Very few Indian theological treatises were translated into Greek or Latin or summarized and consequently were relatively unknown in the Roman Empire. During the same period when Bardesanes met the Brahmans, the Christian writer Hippolytos reported in his heresiological work several Brahmanic doctrines72 that correspond to the theology of Sanskrit sources and above all the Maitrt-Upanishad.73 The knowledge of the contents of the Maitrt-Upanishad appears to have been quite correct, even though one cannot decide whether the Christian heretics had read a translation or had learned the Upanishad's philosophy directly from the Brahmans. Now we meet again, on the gem, a doctrine of the Upanishads, and again this concept appears in the Maitri-Upanishad : the doctrine of Isvara, or, more precisely, of Ardhanarisvara. One could suppose that Isvara's theology and Ardhanarisvara's iconography were influenced by Western theologies, and more importartt, by Platonism, and that the Brahmans - traveling, living, or dwelling for some time in Syria - were the medium between India and Western thought.74 But there are strong reasons to suppose this influence came in an inverse way, from India to the Hellenistic 71 See S.

This is not the place to discuss such a complex topic at length. For us it is enough to have discovered important new evidence of the influence of the Maitrf-Upanishad theology on Western theological thought. After having focused on the debt from the Upanishads of the doctrine in Bardesanes and the gem's iconography, it is difficult to accept the hypothesis that Bardesanes strongly modified Brahmanic theology under the influence of his Syrian Christianity, linked to Gnosis and Platonism.75 The description of the god cannot be defined as Bardesanes's fantasy,76 for we have discovered a lot of corresponding particulars in Indian sculp- tures. The series of symbols of everything that covered the body of the god has no precise model in Ardhanarisvara's iconography, and therefore Cristiano Castelletti sought it in several statues of the "cosmological Bud- dha,"77 whose garments are decorated by symbols of the cosmic order. Instead, the gem points, rather, toward Shiva's iconography and the head, which is encircled by sunbeams, depends not only on the solar theology of the western provinces, but also on the doctrines of the Upanishads .78 Leaving these topics aside, it is worth noting that the Brahmans in Syria or Mesopotamia were aware of Platonic theology and other streams of Western thought. They inspired the gem cutter or inspired one wise man, or a Magus, who gave the gem cutter a drawing of the androgynous god in front of the creator. We do not know whether Brahmans or their pupils modified the Indian iconographical models so as to merge them with Platonic or Gnostic ideas. Aristoxenos the Peripatetic imagined a meeting between Socrates and a Brahman, who taught Socrates the identity of man and divine nature.79 The Brahmans' ability to teach in Greek cannot be ruled out, because in India many Greek kings ruled after Alexander the Great and after the foundation of an independent Greek kingdom in Bactria under Diodotos I (3rd century BC). The tradition of Milinda-Menandros (second half of the 2nd century BC)80 discussing philosophy with Buddhist wise men proves 75 R. Reitzenstein, H.H.

A cen- tury before Menandros, Ashoka (first half of the 3rd century BC) wrote letters to Macedonian kings in Greece, Syria, Libya, and Egypt to explain Buddhist ethics.81 The possibility of learning Indian philosophy and religion was open to the Greeks. Furthermore, we are not at all sure that the gem was produced in Syria, because Damascius says that a group of Brahmans once went to Alexandria82 and it is possible that some influences of Brahmanic thought were also accepted in Egypt. The gem in the British Museum described in this chapter (see Figure 3.5, p. 73), depicting Harpokrates with a snake, is similar to the gem in Naples. A Gandharan relief from Swat shows a human being on a lotus flower and indicates an influence of Harpokrates's iconography on Buddhist imagery.83 These facts suggest that Egypt could have played a role in the gem's iconography. Therefore it is possible that a Platonizing theologist influenced by Indian ideas ordered the gem from an engraver, who was used to producing gems engraved with the image of Harpokrates. Knowledge of Indian theologies was gotten through the teachings of the Brahmans and readings of some books. Another way was knowing the iconographies of Indian gods. The best known example of this is found in the ivory statue that represents the goddess Lakshmi, which was discovered at Pompei.84 Contact between India and the Roman Empire was exceedingly frequent during the Severan period, when the Parthian 81 J.

An Indian origin of the gem is out of the question because of the quite correct engraving of the Greek inscription on the reverse. A few magical gems are supposed to come from India [C.W. King, The Gnostics and their Remains (London: Bell and Daldy, 1887), 297-302; C. Bonner, "Amulets chiefly in the British Museum," Hesperia 20 (1951): 308] but their antiquity is under suspicion. Traces of the activity of gem-engraving workshops have been discovered at Virapatnam, near Pondichery, where a cornaline that depicts Augustus has been found: see J. Filliozat, "Les echanges de PInde et de PEmpire romain aux premiers siecles de Pere chretienne", Revue Historique 201 (1949): 18.

This is proved by the discovery of a number of Severan aurei, and even their local imitations, which have been found in India.85 Through the examination of these gems we know of another exceptional case of an interaction between theologies. As claimed by Flavius Philostra- tus,86 the Indian Brahmans taught that the cosmos was a living being that was made up of both sexes, which loved each other and thus created the cosmos itself. The attitude of the creator on the gem recalls that of theurgists during their performances. In fact, Michael Psellus, commenting on a fragment of the Chaldaean Oracles, writes: As they [the theurgists] whirled them [magical golden balls called iynges], they uttered random sounds, or sounds like an animal, laughing and lashing the air. [The Oracle] teaches that the movement of the top, having an ineffable power, accomplishes the rite.87 "Theurgist" meant "he who is acting like a god."88 Theurgists did use whips, roared like animals, and also used axes, so as to imitate the creator god, whose image is depicted on the Naples gem. One could therefore suppose that the gem corresponds to Indian theological ideas merged with some features of theurgical religion. Moreover, one has to admit that the Gnostic ideas shared similar features of the animal-like creator, who was inspired by the vision of supreme realities. According to Gnostic ideas - as we have seen - the supreme divinities were androgynous.89 Having ascertained the Indian influence on the iconography of that gem, it is possible to put forward a hypothetical interpretation of the inscription charkandabrae as a (partially) Sanskrit word, which surrounds the god's head. In Sanskrit cakra signifies "disk, wheel, circle,"90 but the rest, dabrae, has no meaning. It is possible to add that the word 85 P. Berghaus Peter, "Felicitas saeculi in Indien", in MOYLIKOX ANHP.

Actually, the thinker who conceived this amulet had a rich and profound knowledge of theology and philosophy. He was active during the same period as Origenes, Julius Africanus, and Bardesanes, who were tracing new paths in the field of religion. He was looking for a synthesis among the highest theological speculations, such as Platonic, Jewish, Indian, and maybe theurgical ones. The classification of such gems as "magic" is the result of a judgment, a judgment that derives from a biased opposition between magic and religion that occurred during the Roman Empire. The strongest supporters of such an opposition were the Christian apologists, whose points of view had been accepted by Roman Christian emperors and jurists.92 ANOTHER POSSIBLE CONTEMPLATING CREATOR The passage by Porphyry continues by saying: He (Bardesanes) says that he has made an inquiry about the statue's material. Sandales asserted and others claimed that nobody knew the nature of this material. In fact it was not of gold nor of silver, bronze or stone, it is rather similar to hard wood and absolutely free from putridity. But it is not wood. They added that one king wanted to pull out one of the hairs from around the neck, but blood flowed and the king got so scared that with difficulty he got over the shock thanks to the prayers of Brahmans. They say that on the statue's head there is apparently a statue of a god sitting on a throne. From this passage we learn that the statue was hairy, so we can presume that this "hairiness" describes the male half. One hairy god is represented on a gem together with another creator god, Chnoumis. 1. In fact, in the British Museum there is a yellow jasper gem (Figure 3.8)93 on which a divinity is represented in a static position. It is an anthropomorphic hairy animal, with short legs, open arms, and raised 91 PGM II, 65, where the word had to be repeated eleven times, eliminating a letter each time. 92 On this opposition see Mastrocinque, From Jewish Magic , Â§Â§ 64-67. 93 Michel, British Museum , no. 156. J.F. Quack, review of Michel, British Museum , Gnomon 76 (2004): 262, suspects this gem and all those depicting this god are fakes. Actually there are no grounds for seriously raising such a doubt. 87</page><page sequence="92">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS Figure 3.8 Yellow jasper in the British Museum, London, representing a hairy god and the snake Chnoubis.

Over its head a snake is raised, the snake's head is decorated with a palm branch. On the left side the name XNOYMIE and the Chnoubis's sign (SSS barred by one central line) are cut. Chnoumis, or Chnoubis, is a peculiar form of the Egyptian creator god Chnum, whose snake's body has a lion's head. This god is represented on the right side of the gem, coiled and looking up to the tall god. On the reverse side the inscription is: HAIAMBPQ ABPAMAQ0 ANOX (Eliambro Abramaoth Anoch). 2. The same god is depicted on another gem (Figure 3.9) made of the same material, which is kept in the Skolouda collection.94 In this case its arms are almost completely open, its head is that of a dog, it is ithyphallic and standing on bended legs. It is alone and the inscription on the reverse is: HAIABPQ NHMEMOPQ IIOIIEATE AIIONON TON XTOMAXON MAPIAN (Eliambro Nenemoro free Maria from stom- ach pains). 3. The same god is depicted on another yellow jasper in the Staatliche Miinzsammlung in Munich.95 Here the inscription ends with . . .

A red jasper in the British Museum97 depicts the same god and has the inscription: HAIAMBPQ (Figure 3.11). There are two possible interpretations of this gem: two gods (Chnoumis and the hairy god) are simply coupled so as to join their forces in the same amulet, or they are represented in a specific attitude toward each other. We have no sure means of choosing either interpretation. In the second case, the creator, Chnum, is contemplating the image of a static god.

The speculation of the Naassenes looked for traces of such a god in the pagan tradition and through the mysteries of Samothracia they found a record of such a divine manifesta- tion.

Habitually there stand in the temple of the Samothracians two images of naked men, having both hands stretched aloft towards heaven, and their pudenda erecta, as with the statue of Mercury on Mount Cyllene. It is possible (but far from certain) that the ithyphallic and cynocephalic god100 on the gems is Mercury/Hermes in his Egyptian form. The Egyptian Hermes was Thoth, who had two main iconographies, either as a baboon or as an ibis. The cynocephalic ape is often represented on magical gems with raised arms and a phallus, in adoration of the sun god Harpokrates. The interpretation of the gem as the creator in contemplation of the Anthropos is probable. If we want to take a step further in the same direction, we notice the little snake on the Anthropos's head. Its position is the same as the small 99 Or Adamna; see D.M. Cosi, "Adamma. Un problema e qualche proposta", Atti e Memorie delVAccademia Patavina 88/3 (1975-76): 149-56. 100 According to S.

In this case, it is often assumed that it represented the river Ganges over the head of Ardhanarisvara. Sometimes the images of Shiva show a furious old woman twisted in the hair of the god; she is Ganga, the personification of the Indian river.101 In Western thought such a goddess could not have a meaning. According to Bardesanes and Porphyry, instead of this woman, a god on a throne was represented. One image of Ardhanarisvara shows him with a snake in his hair.102 The little snake on the gems could represent the snake-god of the Northern pole of the heaven, the divine supreme god, according to some Gnostic religious streams.103 In this case, the cynocephalic Anthropos was raising his hands and his phallus toward this god. Obviously, other interpretations are possible. The simple use of these amulets, which were cut for the health of the stomach and other organs, should not lead us to underestimate the theological speculation that supports the daily use of amulets. 101 Yadav, 26-27; Castelletti, 264.

Communication between Brahmans and people of the Roman Empire would not have been exceptional, even though it was very rare to have the opportunity of bringing together a thinker like Bardesanes and Indian wise men. According to the fabulous story of Apollonius of Tyana by Flavius Philostratus,104 this Pythagorean prophet once went to India and met the Brahmans. They gave him seven rings, on which the names of seven planets were cut, and he wore these rings alternately during the week. It is very probable that this story is only a fable, but readers of Philostra- tus accepted it as a possibility. The gem in the Museum of Naples shows that such magical stones were produced under the influence of Indian Brahmanic doctrines. In this way the divine Anthropos, the supreme Idea produced by the unknowable and higher god to give a model to creation, was proposed in the Indian style. 104 Vita Apollonii 111.41. 93</page><page sequence="98">Chapter 4 ASKLEPIOS LEONTOUCHOS AND DIVINE TRIADS ON SYRIAN GEMS</page><page sequence="99">ONE ARABIAN DIVINE TRIAD AND ONE FROM HIERAPOLIS Magical gems are not exclusively a product of Roman Egypt. Syria and neighboring areas played an important role in their production. Several years ago Glen Bowersock1 produced a short study about an inscribed jasper gem that was seen by Wilhelm Froehner in Nazareth.2 The inscrip- tion on the gem is: APHX 0EANAPOXO AOYXAPH NOYAEMIÂ© HPAE0H PABON In the fourth line a feminine Semitic name can be recognized: No')Xe|i.l0, or better Zot)Xe|i.i0: Â§lmt. Papoq is a male Semitic name, and line 5 contains a verb, t|paa0T|, "is loved." Therefore Bowersock suggests a magical use for the gem in an erotic context. This fact isolates the three names on lines 1-3 as those of a divine triad: Ares, Theandr(i)os, and Dusare(s). The coinage of the city of Bostra under the Roman Emperors Elagabalus, Decius, and Etruscilla depicts two baetyls (sacred stones supposed to be endowed with life and to be seats of gods) and bears the name of Dusares. The name of the second baetyl could be one of those on the gem. This is not a singular case among magical gems; we know of a few specimens that depict triads from cities of the Near East, and the joint study of gems and coins allows a good understanding of the local civic cults. Indeed, the coinage of a number of Near Eastern cities depicts local gods, which are sometimes organized in triads. Another example is that of a hematite from Seyrig's collection3 (Figure 4.1), now in the Cabinet des Medailles, and bought at Aleppo. The form of this intaglio is very similar to a small kidney. Pliny the Elder4 knew of a stone called "Adad's kidney"; it is highly probable that this stone was 1 G. Bowersock. "An Arabian Trinity," HTR 79 (1986): 17-21. 2 W.

The Orphei lithika kerygmata6 mention the mantic properties of siderite, a sort of hematite, and therefore one cannot exclude a mantic purpose for this intaglio.

This rich collection was acquired by the municipality in 1842. The style of the engraving would suggest a date in the 2nd or 3rd century CE On its surface, from left to right, one can see: an Egyptian god standing and holding a nekhekh whip and a was sceptre. He wears a wig that is decorated with a disc and a large atefctovm. He is accompanied by three lions walking to the right. Tyche is standing at the center, holding the cornucopia with her left hand and a bird with the right. A small crown, formed by two lines, is on her head. It is the same type of crown that usually adorns Isis's head on the gems of Imperial times. Perseus is standing on the right, holding the harpe in his raised right hand; he holds a round shield (rather than the bag to hide Medusa's head) with his left. Behind the shield there is a palm branch. His head bears a Phrygian or Persian hat; on his legs he wears anaxyrides (trousers worn by Eastern nations). 5 On which: Macrobius 1.17.66-67. 6 18, 156-7 Halleux-Schamp. 7 Seyrig, "Antiquites syriennes. 40." 8H.

Many cities of Southern Phoenicia and Palestine, especially Ioppe,12 venerated the Greek hero, who was believed to be an ancestor of the Persians.13 In Egypt too Perseus was greatly respected, especially in the Theban district.14 Fishermen of the Erythrean sea called a big fish "Perseus,"15 clearly remembering the myth of Perseus and Danae recovered by the fishermen of Seryphos, as told in Aeschylos's Diktylkoi .16 Scenes and characters of the myth of Perseus were popular in Anatolia, especially during the Persian domination, as has been proved by the pictures of Elmah in Lycia or by the cult of Chrysaor in eastern Caria. In the late 4th century BC on Samarian silver issues, the Gorgoneion and Pegasus were represented.17 The Gorgon was the monster that Perseus beheaded and Pegasus was the horse that was engendered by the Gorgon and the brother of Chrysaor.

The Persian Empire was probably the catalyst for such a widespread phenomenon. The local name of the Greek hero, Phanebalos, and the bad quality of coin engraving engendered some misunderstanding about this protagonist of Ascalonite mythology. The name derives from the Greek rendering of the Semitic pn b'l, "Face of Baal."19 This name is typical of Tanit as is stated in many inscriptions of Carthaginian territory.20 Consequently, a hypothesis has been proposed according to which the god on the Ascalonite coins is Tanit herself.21 A sign in the form of the Greek A with a bar above, on a bronze coin issued under Hadrian22 has been taken as a proof of this identification.23 However, one has to admit that it is impossible to identify a god with barpe and Persian dress as Tanit. Reinhold Merkelbach and Maria Totti recognized a similar expression in the words &lt;|&gt;ov 060 of the 7th magical papyrus,24 whose meaning could be "face of Thoth." Another occurrence of the same expression is found on a magical axe.25 Javier Teixidor26 underlined that Phanebal signifies "face, or presence of Baal," and that Astarte was named XAMABQA.Q, sm b'l , "name of Baal" at Ugarit and Tyros.27 He supposed also that Phanebalos was identi- fied with Apollo.28 In Egypt it was very common to call a deity "the soul, the heart ... of another god."

The Jewish tradition knew the hand, the arm, the feet, the wisdom, the word of God - in the Imperial Age many of these divine manifestations were worshipped as independent gods. Also Perseus of Ascalon was a major god of Ascalon. His relation to Baal was probably similar to that of the Greek hero to Zeus: His son. The cult of Perseus was a peculiar Near-Eastern and 103</page><page sequence="106">KRONOS, SHIVA, AND ASKLEPIOS Egyptian feature, whereas the Greeks gave him minor importance. In consideration of the antiquity of the spreading of the cult of Perseus in Anatolia, Palestine, Samaria, and Egypt, one cannot exclude that any feature of his myth had been borrowed by the Greeks from an Eastern culture. Furthermore, Perseus earned an important place in the religious doctrines that could be defined as non-Christian gnosis.30 The leontocepha- lic warrior god, who was called Ialdabaoth or Sabaoth, was sometimes depicted as Medusa's conqueror. On several gems he is holding the mon- ster's head and a sword31 (Figure 4.4). Another gem bears an inscription that mentions Perseus as he who pursues the demon of pellagra.32 ASKLEPIOS WITH THE LIONS A lead tessera from Ascalon depicts Phanebalos, AsklepioS, and Hygieia.33 Therefore, it is evident that the physician god was worshipped with the Greek hero. In Ascalon, Asclepios had very peculiar features: he was a god accompanied by three lions. The god with three lions and Egyptian dress is typical of the Ascalonite pantheon, which has been recently studied by Nicole Belayche.34 His image recurs on the coins of that city35 (Figures 4.5 and 4.6) and on six gems.3&lt; 30 A.

Reproduced by courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum. This god is actually Asklepios Leontouchos, an important god of Asca- lon, in honor of whom Proclus wrote a hymn.46 His Egyptian dress and symbols prove that he is not the god of Epidauros and Cos, but rather a local healing god, similar to the Egyptian Imhotep. The famous architect of the Djoser pyramid at Memphis (Saqqara) was identified as Asklepios, which aroused the belief that he was the true Asklepios.47 The myth and the cult of Imhotep is very old (there is evidence of it from the XII-XIII dynasties onward) and the Ptolemies contributed to his success. Manetho48 calls him Imouthes and says that he was a wonderful architect, scribe, and physician, who was therefore identified as Asklepios. He was supposed to be the son of Ptah49; hymns to him were written on the wall of Ptah's temple at Karnak, built in the age of Tiberius, and on the gate of Hator's temple at Dendera, built under Claudius.50 The Egyptian god was con- nected to Osiris at Phile, in the age of Ptolemy V.51 When examining the gem in Verona, the observer may consider himself to be regarding the first known image of a god related to Imhotep, that is, the Egyptian Asklepios. Indeed, his similarity to Osiris was perhaps the result of the link between 46Marinus, Vita Procli 19. 47 PGM VII, 629-42. On Imhotep, see D. Wildung, Imhotep und Amenhotep.

The Hellenistic and Roman form of Osiris, that is, Sarapis, was identified with Asklepios at Bethesda.52 DERKETO- ISIS- TYCHE The goddess at the center of the triad is one of Ascalon's major divinities. A typical goddess of Ascalon was Derketo ("the mighty one"), and her idol was that of a big woman-headed fish. 53 The same goddess is represented on the Seleucid coins of Damascus.54 Diodorus55 says that in Ascalon doves were sacred and revered as divinities. Other authors refer to Ascalon's doves56 as well. In Hierapolis, also in Syria, doves were sacred to Derketo.57 At Ascalon and Aphrodisias, in Caria, the doves, sacred to Aphrodite, lived undisturbed as it was forbidden to catch them.58 The dove was also the symbol of Ascalon on late republican and Imperial Age coins.59 On one coin60 she wears a moon sickle on her head and is accompanied by a sea Triton. The Phoenicians, Syrians, and Cypriots often associated doves with Astarte and Aphrodite (identified with Astarte).61 The bird that the goddess is holding on the gem is a dove. Astarte was another great goddess of Ascalon, often called Palestinian Astarte, or Aphrodite Ourania by her devotees at Delos.62 A symbol of Astarte's rule over the sea is evident on the coin: the aplustre63 (the ornament on the ship's stern), and therefore one can deduce that this goddess is also Derketo.

The presence of the cornucopia indicates that this is the goddess Tyche, who was indeed venerated at Ascalon.64 The cornucopia was particularly important during the first Hellenistic age, when Seleucos founded Anti- ochia and created the cultic image of Tyche. Ptolemy I and II both used the cornucopia (or the double cornucopia) as a symbol of their power.65 The crown decorated with towers and a cornucopia was a common symbol of Tyche and, later, of Fortuna. The goddess on the gem wears a simple crown that is typical of the crown worn by Isis on the gems of Imperial times. On a coin of Ascalon the same goddess also wears the crown of Tyche (Figure 4.10).66 During the Hellenistic period many cities chose the most important local female divinity and revered her as the civic Tyche, that is, the protec- tive numen and the personification of the city.67 The most famous case is that of Kybele at Smyrna, who was represented on the coins as wearing the civic crown. This city-goddess was depicted on a pillar in the basilica at Ascalon (Figure 4.11), of the Severan age.68 Here the goddess wears a polos with an Egyptian ornament, and a small male figure, maybe a priest 64 Fuks, 30-31; Th.

Moreover, it is easy to explain the presence of the attributes of Isis, Astarte/ Aphrodite, and Tyche in the same divine figure. Modern scholarship has recognized that Ascalon was a Philistine-Phoenician city with strong Egyp- tian infuences,71 that is, an intercultural city. Its geographical location is the primary reason for that phenomenon; one hundred years (301-200 BC) of Ptolemaic rule is another. 69 A.

Damascius, the last Neoplatonist, says: "Theologists call the polymorphic gods Aiones because of the first Aion's nature."1 Indeed, Proteus, for example, is only one feature among a constellation of multiform gods. These divine rulers were continuously changing their forms or contained in themselves all the forms of living beings. On many magical gems and other monuments an Egyptian god appears (see Figure 3.6, p. 78), whose head is decorated with many animal heads or even with vegetal2 elements. This god has been known in Egyptian iconography since the first millenium BC. His name varies. In modern literature he is labeled as Pantheos, Bes Pantheos, or a polymorphic god. Sometimes he is depicted with seven or nine heads.3 The speculations of theologists of the Imperial Age connected this god to the Orphic traditions, as is proved by the inscription on a gem from Byblos.4 He was considered a creator god, after whom all the living beings in the world were shaped.5 Several Gnostic sects were interested in the study of this god, who was considered to be the creator and was known by the Egyptians.6 A quite ancient Egyptian tradition claimed that the sun god changed his form during the day: He was a lotus leaf in the morning, a lion at noon, and a ram in the evening. Consequently, he could be called Serphouthmouisrd.7 Several gems and passages of the magical papyri depict four forms of the sun during the day.8 It was thought by several Gnostic sects that Christ himself was a changeable being, alternately young and old.9 Like the sun god, the moon goddess was considered to be a changeable being. In particular, the threeform Hekate - who was identified with the 1 Damascius, in Platonis Parmenidem 1 50 Westerink, Combes; cf. G.

She was similar to Hekate11 in that she was a shapeshifter, continuously changing into differ- ent animals; she was thought to have one bronze leg12 in the form of a donkey's leg.13 She was a popular character of folktales and afterlife scenar- ios during the age of Aristophanes. As Sarah lies Johnston14 has shown, Empousa was the demon who impeded (the name comes apparently from the same root of words such as empodon : "underfoot," or empodeia : "impediment") man from going on his way, and especially impeded safe passage of the soul either through the process of initiation15 or on the way to a safe haven in Hades after death. This same demon is mentioned in Solomon's Testament ,16 a work of the Imperial Age, in which many demons are depicted along with the spells and the angels that could conquer and exorcize them. In this exorcism handbook the demon is called Onoskelis, that is "donkey's leg." It is also evident that he - or she - is none other than Empousa. As one can see in the lexica, repertories, and encyclopaedias, until now no iconography of Empousa was known. But actually three gems do depict Empousa. One description has been published quite recently. This gem came from Gadara,17 in Jordan; the other one is larger and clearer in its details (Figure 5. 1 ) . It was in the De Clercq collection18 and is now preserved 10 See A.

It came from Baghdad. On the obverse side it depicts a demon similar to Hekate, but the demon has one bird's leg and one donkey's leg. Her tail is that of a bird. The same tail is represented on a heliotrope kept in Bonn, on which the goddess has two different legs and feet.19 This is not the only case of a goddess or demon derived from Hekate's iconography. For instance, a recipe in the magical papyri20 orders the cutting of a gem with Hekate's image, but with three heads: one of a horned girl, one of a dog, and a third of a goat. The triple head is reminiscent of the three heads of Cerberus, which were supposed to signify the passing of time, or the forms of the sun.21 Demons who changed their forms were known to the Neoplatonist Iamblicus.22 Perhaps these included Empousa or other similar demons. On the reverse side of the gem depicted in Figure 5.1 in the center one reads: OAY2TINA (i.e., Faustina), surrounded by the palindromon ABAANA0ANAABA (i.e., Ablanathanalba). This magical word can be read in both directions and, when written in a circle, creates a magical ring, keeping everything inside the ring prisoner. In fact a magical papyrus describes a ritual that was able to force someone or something to do what the pratictioner wanted by putting him or it at the center of a magical ring.23 In this case the palindromon to be written was IAEOBAPHRENEMOUNOTHILARIKRIPHIAEUEAIFIRKIRALITHONUOMENERPHABO EAI Recipes of two magical papyri state that this magical word was equal to the name of the Jewish god24 and to the snake ouroboros, which eats its own tail.25 This magical gem was typically used for love magic. Faustina was the name of a desired girl and he who used the gem wanted to subdue her and have her at his disposal.26 19 E. Zwierlein-Diehl, Siegel und Abdruck. Antike Gemmen in Bonn .
