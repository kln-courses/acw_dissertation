<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES * PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS AMERICAN CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Spring 2012, Vol. 86, No. 1 Holy Fear, REBECCA KONYNDYK This essay contends that there is something called holy fear, which expresses love for God. First, it distinguishes holy fear from certain types of unholy fear and from the type of fear regulated by the virtue of courage. Next, relying on the work of Thomas Aquinas, the paper considers the roles love and power play in holy and unholy fear and extends this analysis of the passion of fear by means of an analogy to the capital vices. The essay concludes that this extension illuminates the moral significance of John Paul II's call not to be afraid and shows how this theme of his pontificate is inextricably linked to another great theme of his teaching, that of love as a gift of oneself. Trichotomizing the Standard Twofold Model of Thomistic Eudaimonism : A Solution to a Logical Problem , T. J. LÓPEZ Aquinas's eudaimonism is normally interpreted as twofold in the sense of being divided into the imperfect, natural happiness of Aristotle and the perfect, supernatural happiness of Augustine. This work argues that Aquinas is logically committed to a third type of happiness that, in light of the standard view, renders his eudaimonism threefold. The paper begins with an overview of the standard twofold model of Aquinas's eudaimonism; it then turns to the model's logical problem whose solution requires the postulation of a third type of happiness. In the second part of the paper, two clarifying issues are addressed and several objections are considered. In closing, the essay explains why Aquinas's commitment to a third type of happiness offers the Christian wayfarer grounds for a new optimism. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of the Review.

The Case of Thomas Aquinas , DAVID SVOBODA This paper deals with the problem of the ratio of unity in the work of Thomas Aquinas. More specifically, it tries to answer the question wherein the ratio of unity consists: whether it is a "positive entity of being" or rather the "negative aspect of being undivided." In order to answer the question properly the paper is divided into four main parts. In the first two parts the constitutive characteristics of unity are explained and attention is focused on the concepts division and negation of division. In the third part Aquinas's statements that seem to reflect a negative conception of unity are expounded and the relationship of unity and goodness to the "entitative principles" of being (essence and existence) are elucidated. Finally, in the fourth part the answer to the fundamental question of the article is given and arguments for the "positive" conception of unity are presented. Transubstantiation , Tropes , and Truthmakers , TIMOTHY J. PAWL This article addresses a difficult case at the intersection of philosophical theology and truthmaker theory. It shows that three views, together, lead to difficulties in providing truthmakers for truths of contingent predication, such as that the bread is white. These three views are: the Catholic dogma of transubstantiation, a standard truthmaker theory, and a trope (or accident) view of properties. The paper presents and explains each of these three views, at each step noting their connections to the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas. After presenting the three views, the paper shows why they entail a difficulty for providing truthmakers for truths of contingent predication, drawing on two cases that are not impossible, for all we know. The article then presents four ways that one can respond to this difficulty, afterward noting some shortcomings of those responses. Can It Be Morally Permissible to Assert a Falsehood in Service of a Good Cause? CHRISTOPHER KACZOR This paper examines three arguments that are meant to show that all intentional false assertions are intrinsically evil. The first argument holds that lying is intrinsically evil, and all false assertions are lies. The second argument is that all intentional deception is intrinsically evil, and all false assertions are attempted deceptions. Finally, the paper explores the argument that false assertions are intrinsically evil because they are a violation of self-unity and unity with the community. Each of these arguments, the paper argues, fails to demonstrate the conclusion, which nevertheless, may be true for other reasons not examined in this paper.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 921 Augustine , Aquinas , and the Absolute Norm against Lying , CHRISTOPHER TOLLEFSEN Recent events concerning the guerilla journalism group Live Action created controversy over the morality of lying for a good cause. In that controversy, I defended the absolutist view about lying, the view that lying, understood as assertion contrary to one's belief, is always wrong. This essay steps back from the specifics of the Live Action case to look more closely at what St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas had to say in defense of the absolutist view. Their approaches, while rather different, are nevertheless complementary, and cast light on both practical and principled reasons for thinking that lying is wrong, even for a good cause. The final section of the paper discusses some of the challenges that a further defense of the absolute view would need to meet. Thomistic Perspectives?: Martin Rhonheimer's Version of Virtue Ethics, STEVEN J. JENSEN Martin Rhonheimer's The Perspective of Morality: Philosophical Foundations of Thomistic Virtue Ethics offers a bold summary of Thomistic virtue ethics, laid upon some not-so-Thomistic foundations, culminating in questionable, perhaps even dangerous, conclusions concerning actions evil in themselves. As an introduction to ethical thought, the book covers a wide range of topics, including happiness, freedom, the nature of human actions, the moral virtues, conscience, the principles of practical reason, conse- quentialism, Kantian ethics, and much more. For some of these topics Rhonheimer provides a helpful summary of the ethics of Aquinas, sprinkled with thoughtful reflections for the modern age. For other topics Rhonheimer introduces questionable interpretations and developments of Aquinas, written with obscurity and lack of precision. This article provides some suggested alternatives to Rhonheimer's account, especially with regard to the origin of the first practical principles. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY April 2012, Vol. 49, No. 2 Reflection , Disagreement , and Context , EDWARD S. HINCHMAN How far, if for any length at all, do our intrapersonal and our inter- personal epistemic obligations run in parallel? How are we epistemically obligated to weigh diverging opinions - a change of mind - that we expect we will have in the future? Do those obligations resemble whatever obligations we may have to be responsive to the opinions of peers who disagree with us?</page><page sequence="4">922 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS This essay recommends that we treat these questions as addressing the stability of doxastic commitment in the two dimensions. If we think of belief as paradigmatically the product of doxastic deliberation, as some philo- sophers now do, then we can view forming a belief as bringing doxastic deliberation to a proper conclusion, thereby generating a properly stable commitment. And we can make our questions more specific: Does a doxastic stance that fails to do justice to expected future opinion manifest a properly stable orientation as it moves forward into that future? Does a doxastic stance that fails to do justice to interpersonal disagreement manifest a properly stable orientation as it moves outward into the social give-and-take of reasons? How far, if at all, do these species of doxastic stability run in parallel? Rational Epistemic Akrasia, ALLEN COATES Epistemic akrasia arises when one holds a belief even though one judges it to be irrational or ui'justified. There is some debate about whether epistemic akrasia is possible, but this article will assume for the sake of argument that it is, in order to consider whether it can be rational. More precisely, the article will consider whether cases can arise in which both the belief one judges to be irrational and one's judgment of it are epistemically rational. Perceived Colors and Perceived Locations : A Problem for Color Subjectivism , PETER W. ROSS Color subjectivism claims that colors attributed to external physical objects in virtue of visual experience - or perceived colors - are not instantiated by those objects. Instead, perceived colors are wholly explained in terms of visual experience itself. (Subjectivism is often called elimina- tivism or irrealism.) Subjectivism is a theory of the nature of color and is, strictly speaking, independent of a theory of color perception. But a theory of the nature of color sets constraints on a theory of color perception. For example, subjectivism sets the extremely strong constraint that color perception does not involve a causal relation between perceivers and colors instantiated by physical objects external to the mind. The question that this essay addresses is whether there is a plausible theory of color perception that meets the subjectivist constraint. If not, and assuming that any theory of the nature of color is simply untenable if it cannot be combined with a plausible theory of color perception, subjectivism is untenable. How to Manipulate an Incompatibilistically Free Agent , ROGER CLARKE A prominent criticism of compatibilist theories of moral responsibility is that they do not deal adequately with cases of manipulation, and particularly with induced desires. So, for example, accounts that give the conditions for</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 923 responsibility in terms of the reasons-responsiveness of the mechanism governing one's decisions, as Fischer and Ravizza do, seem to leave the door open to cases such as that dealt with in this article. Reasoning , Normativity , and Experimental Philosophy , SUSANA NUCCETELLI and GARY SEAY The development of modern science, on one widely held view, has come largely through naturalizing domains of inquiry that were historically parts of philosophy. Theories based on speculation about matters empirical were replaced with law-based, predictive explanatory theories that invoked empirical data as supporting evidence. Although philosophers have, by and large, applauded such developments, there is no consensus about whether inquiry into normative domains can be naturalized. Since the early twentieth century, attempts at naturalizing ethics have been at the center of heated debates, and later attempts at naturalizing epistemology triggered similarly contentious disputes. But there have so far been no substantial reactions to attempts at naturalizing inquiry into another plainly normative domain, that of reasoning. The article offers a partial remedy to this state of affairs by challenging a naturalistically minded argument offered by Stephen Stich and his collaborators against the Goodman account of the justification of rules of inference. This argument invokes a number of results from psychology as evidence of a relativism problem facing the Goodman account, and more generally, analytic epistemology as a whole. T-Gunk and Exact Occupation , DANIEL GIBERMAN Evidentiary Fallacies and Empirical Data , MICHAEL BYRON AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY June 2012, Vol. 90, No. 2 Reasons and Causes: The Philosophical Battle and the Meta- Philosophical War , GIUSEPPINA D'ORO "Are the reasons for acting also the causes of action?" When this question was asked in the early 1960s it received by and large a negative reply: "No, reasons are not causes." Yet, when the same question "Are the reasons for acting the causes of action?" is posed some twenty years later, the predominant answer is "Yes, reasons are causes." How could one and the same question receive such diverging answers in the space of only a couple of</page><page sequence="6">924 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS decades? This paper argues that the shift from an anti-causalist to a causalist consensus is not fully accounted for by the results of first-order debates in the philosophy of action and is owing instead to a change in second-order meta- philosophical assumptions concerning the role and character of philosophical analysis. Why Be an Agent? EVAN TIFFANY Constitutivism is the view that it is possible to derive contentful, normatively binding demands of practical reason and morality from the constitutive features of agency. Whereas much of the debate has focused on the constitutivisťs ability to derive content, David Enoch has challenged this ability to generate normativity. Even if one can derive content from the constitutive aims of agency, one could simply demur: "Bah! Agency, shmagency." The "Why be moral?" question would be replaced by the "Why be an agent?" question. It is the aim of this paper to show that the shmagency objection is essentially correct, though not as originally defended by Enoch. Since Enoch posed his argument as ruling out the normative authority of agency under any conception of the constitutive features of agency, constitutivists have responded by arguing for the inescapability of certain minimal features of agency. This paper argues that this amounts to equivoca- tion: the constitutivist appeals to a minimal conception of agency in answering the normative question but to a richer understanding in answering the content question. The key to the shmagency objection, as this paper defends it, is to insist that the same sense of agency must be employed in answering both questions. A shmagent can concede that there may be inescapable ways of understanding agency, but insist that any such understanding would have to be too minimal to generate substantive content. How to Adjust Utility for Deserty BRAD SKOW It is better when people get what they deserve. So we need an axiology according to which the intrinsic value of a possible world is a function of both how well-off and how deserving the people in that world are. But how should these "desert-adjusted" values of possible worlds be calculated? It is easy to come up with some qualitative ideas. But these qualitative ideas leave us with an embarrassment of riches: too many quantitative functions that implement those qualitative ideas. This paper selects one of these quantitative functions and defends its superiority. Modernizing the Virtue of Humility, ALEX SINHA This paper offers a novel, secular account of the virtue of humility. There are only two such accounts in recent philosophical literature: one defended by Julia Driver, the other by George Schueler. Driver attaches the virtue of humility to people who underestimate their merits, or lack beliefs about their merits altogether. Schueler thinks that humility requires indifference to how we are regarded vis-à-vis our accomplishments. This</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 925 paper brings out the limitations of those accounts and constructs a new one which is free from these limitations. The new account derives directly from the under-appreciated approach defended a century ago by Hastings Rashdall, who developed a secular (albeit religiously-inspired) account of humility according to which true humility reflects love for one's neighbour. After indicating the flaws in Rashdall's approach, this essay develops an account based on his intuitions. Specifically, the essay argues that humility requires suppressing our egos when they lead us to neglect or disregard other duties. Humility has two aspects: a private aspect, by which we uphold self-regarding duties rather than succumb to the temptations of ego; and a public aspect, by which we display fidelity to other-regarding duties at the expense of the pleasures of ego. The Value of Imaginativeness , JAMES GRANT The aim of this paper is to explain why imaginativeness is valuable. Recent discussions of imaginativeness or creativity (regarded here as the same property) have paid relatively little attention to this important question. This discussion has three parts. First, it elucidates the concept of imagina- tiveness by providing three conditions a product or act must satisfy in order to be imaginative. This account enables us to explain, among other things, why imaginativeness is associated with inspiration, why it is associated with the faculty of imagination, and why it is relative to persons and to contexts. Second, in the light of this account, the paper says what the imaginativeness of persons is. Philosophical discussions of the imaginativeness of persons usually treat it as a capacity. In fact, it is a tendency or disposition of a certain kind. Third, the paper gives reasons why the imaginativeness of persons has the value it does. It begins by stating the basic facts about the value of imaginativeness and goes on to provide explanations of each of these facts. The essay concludes by addressing the difficult question of whether a person's imaginativeness is noninstrumentally good for him. On Romantic and Romantic-inspired views, imaginativeness is noninstrumentally good for a person because of its connection with self-realization. The paper rejects this claim. However, it argues that, often, imaginativeness is indeed non- instrumentally good for the imaginative person. What Is Analytic Metaphysics For? JAMES MACLAURIN and HEATHER DYKE This article divides analytic metaphysics into naturalistic and non- naturalistic metaphysics. The latter is defined as any philosophical theory that makes some ontological (as opposed to conceptual) claim, where that ontological claim has no observable consequences. The essay discusses further features of non-naturalistic metaphysics, including its methodology of appealing to intuition, and explains the way in which it is taken to be discontinuous with science. The article outlines and criticizes Ladyman and Ross's 2007 epistemic argument against non-naturalistic metaphysics and goes on to present another argument against it. The paper sets out various</page><page sequence="8">926 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS ways in which intellectual endeavours can be of value, and argues that, in so far as it claims to be an ontological enterprise, non-naturalistic metaphysics cannot be justified according to the same standards as science or naturalistic metaphysics. The lack of observable consequences explains why non- naturalistic metaphysics has, in general, failed to make progress, beyond increasing the standards of clarity and precision in expressing its theories. The article concludes with a series of objections and replies. Eternal Facts in an Ageing Universe , FABRICE CORREIA and SVEN ROSENKRANZ In recent publications, Kit Fine devises a classification of A-theories of time and defends a nonstandard A-theory he calls fragmentalism, according to which reality as a whole is incoherent but fragments into classes of mutually coherent tensed facts. This paper argues that Fine's classification is not exhaustive, as it ignores another nonstandard A-theory we dub dynamic absolutism, according to which there are tensed facts that stay numerically the same and yet undergo qualitative changes as time goes by. The paper expounds this theory in some detail and argues that it is a serious alternative to the positions identified by Fine. Dispositionality : Beyond the Biconditional !s, DAVID MANLEY Suppose dispositions bear a distinctive connection to counterfactual facts, perhaps one that could be enshrined in a variation on the well-worn schema "Necessarily, x is disposed to &lt;j&gt; in ''j iff x would $ in v|a" Could we exploit this connection to provide an account of what it is to be a disposition? This paper is about four views of dispositionality that attempt to do so. Lotteries , Quasi-Lotteries , and Scepticism , EUGENE MILLS I seem to know that I will not experience spaceflight but also that if I win the lottery, then I will take a flight into space. Suppose I competently deduce from these propositions that I will not win the lottery. Competent deduction from known premises seems to yield knowledge of the deduced conclusion. So it seems that I know that I will not win the lottery; but it also seems clear that I do not know this, despite the minuscule probability of my winning (if I have a lottery ticket). So we have a puzzle. It seems to generalize, for analogues of the lottery-proposition threaten almost all ordinary knowledge attributions. For example, my apparent knowledge that my bike is parked outside seems threatened by the possibility that it has been stolen since I parked it, a proposition with a low but nonzero probability; and it seems that I do not know this proposition to be false. Familiar solutions to this family of puzzles incur unacceptable costs - either by rejecting deductive closure for knowledge, or by yielding untenable consequences for ordinary attributions of knowledge or of ignorance. After canvassing and criticizing these solutions, this essay offers a new solution free from these costs. Knowledge that p requires an explanatory link between the fact that p and the belief that p. This</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 927 necessary but insufficient condition on knowledge distinguishes actual lottery cases from typical, apparently analogous "quasi-lottery" cases. It does yield skepticism about my not winning the lottery and not experiencing spaceflight, but the skepticism does not generalize to quasi-lottery cases such as that involving my bike. Two Ways to Put Knowledge First , ALEXANDER JACKSON This paper distinguishes two ways to "put knowledge first." One way affirms a knowledge norm. For example, Williamson argues that one must only assert that which one knows. Hawthorne and Stanley argue that one must only treat as a reason for action that which one knows. Another way to put knowledge first affirms a determination thesis. For example, Williamson argues that what one knows determines what one is justified in believing. Hawthorne and Stanley argue that what one knows determines what it is rational for one to do. This paper argues that the defender of the knowledge norms can and should reject the determination theses. For example, the rationality of acting on a partial belief cannot be explained in terms of the subject's knowledge. That is no problem for the knowledge norm, which only governs acting on full belief. (Analogously, the knowledge norm of flat-out assertion does not govern hedged assertion.) One might worry that rejecting the determination theses undermines the importance of knowing. This paper replies that the knowledge norms set the standard for epistemic success. The importance of success is not undermined by loosening its ties to justification and rationality. Modified Occam's Razor , BEN PHILLIPS According to the principle Grice calls "Modified Occam's Razor" (MOR), "Senses are not to be multiplied beyond necessity." More carefully, MOR says that if there are distinct ways in which an expression is regularly used, then all other things being equal, one should favor the view that the expression is unambiguous and that certain uses of it can be explained in pragmatic terms. This paper argues that MOR cannot have the central role that is typically assigned to it by those who deploy it. More specifically, it argues that potential justifications of the epistemic import of parsimony in semantic theorizing are problematic, and that even if MOR could be justified, it has a redundant role to play in adjudicating the debate between the ambiguity- theorist and the proponent of the pragmatic approach. Parallels between Gaps and Gluts , DANIEL IMMERMAN This paper compares two proposed solutions to the liar paradox, both of which involve revisions to classical semantics. The first, that of truth value gaps, denies that all sentences are true or false. The second, that of truth value gluts, asserts that some sentences are true and false. A natural question about these proposals is, "Do they offer equally good (or bad) solutions, or is</page><page sequence="10">928 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS one better than the other?" Parsons suggested an answer to this question, arguing that for every problem for one solution, there is a parallel problem for the other. Since then, several people have given arguments for and against the idea that the two face parallel problems. This paper advances the debate in two ways. First, it answers four attempts by Graham Priest to reject the parallel. In particular, it discusses alleged advantages for the gap solution with regard to the teleological account of truth, an extended liar paradox, Berry's paradox, and inexpressibility. Second, it discusses where, if any- where, the parallel may be broken. EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY March 2012, Vol. 20, No. 1 Identity , Individuation and Substance , DAVID WIGGINS The paper takes off from the problem of finding a proper content for the relation of identity as it holds or fails to hold among ordinary things or substances. The necessary conditions of identity are familiar, the sufficient conditions less so. The search is for conditions at once better usable than the Leibnizian Identity of Indiscernibles (independently suspect) and strong enough to underwrite all the formal properties of the relation. The article contends that the key to this problem rests at the level of metaphysics and epistemology alike with a sortalist position. Sortalism is the position which insists that, if the question is whether a and b are the same, it has to be asked what are they? Any sufficiently specific answer to that question will bring with it a principle of activity or functioning and a mode of behavior charac- teristic of some particular kind of thing by reference to which questions of persistence or nonpersistence through change can be abjudicated. These contentions are illustrated by reference to familiar examples such as the human zygote, the Ship of Theseus, and Shoemaker's Brown-Brownson. The first example is hostage for a mass of unproblematical cases. The problems presented by the second and third sort of examples arise chiefly (the article suggests) from an incompleteness in our conceptions of the relevant sort - the what the thing in question is. That incompleteness need not prevent us from knowing perfectly well which thing we are referring to. In the con- cluding section, sortalism is defended against various accusations of anthropocentrism. The paper touches on the interpretation of Heraclitus, Leibniz's theory of clear indistinct ideas, the difficulties of David Lewis's "perdurantist" or stroboscopie view of persistence, four-dimensionalism, and the relation of personal identity both to experiential memory and to the particular bodily physiognomy of a subject. At some points - as in connection with the so-called "Only a and b" rule - the paper corrects, supplements or extends certain theses or formulations proposed in the author's Sameness and Substance Renewed .</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 929 Spinoza1 s Three Gods and the Modes of Communication, ETIENNE BALIBAR The paper, which retains a hypothetical character, argues that Spinoza's propositions referring to God (or involving the use of the name "God," essentially in the Ethics ), can be read in a fruitful manner apart from any pre- established hypothesis concerning his own "theological preferences," as definite descriptions of three "ideas of God" which have the same logical status: one (akin to Jewish Monotheism) which identifies the idea of God with the idea of the Law, one (akin to a heretic "Socinian" version of Christianity) which identifies it with the idea of Human Love, and one (akin to a form of Cosmotheism, rather than "Pantheism") which identifies it with Nature. Evidence of this analytic tripartition can be found in the letter of the texts themselves. If accepted (at least as a thought experiment), this reading would carry three interesting consequences: first, it would renew our understanding of the theory of the "three kinds of knowledge," which have obvious affinities with the three possible ways of understanding the idea of God; second, this reading would emphasize the critical move associated by Spinoza with each of the three ideas of God (passing from an anthropomorphic legislator to an impersonal command, passing from an imaginary community of similarities to a practical community of singularities, and passing from a teleological and harmonious idea of nature to a causal, even conflictual, idea of its infinite power); third, this reading would locate the essential ethical and political questions associated with religion on the vectors which lead from one idea to another. Knowing the Essence of the State in Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico- Politicus, AARON GARRETT This paper argues that Spinoza's main political writings are concerned, in part, with knowledge of essences as detailed in the Ethics. It is further argued that knowledge of the essences of states, and essential properties that belong to states, may be an example of the elusive scientia intuitiva or third kind of knowledge. The paper concludes by considering Spinoza's goals in his political writings and the importance of metaphysics and the theory of knowledge more broadly for early modern political philosophers. Compelling Fictions : Spinoza and George Eliot on Imagination and Belief MOIRA GATENS Spinoza took it to be an important psychological fact that belief cannot be compelled. At the same time, he was well aware of the compelling power that religious and political fictions can have on the formation of our beliefs. This paper argues that Spinoza allows that there are "good" and "bad" fictions. His complex account of the imagination and fiction, and their disabling or enabling roles in gaining knowledge of Nature, is a site of disagreement among commentators. The novels of George Eliot (who translated Spinoza's works) represent a significant development for those who aim to resolve such</page><page sequence="12">930 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS disagreement in favor of the epistemic value of the imagination and fiction. Although Eliot agreed with Spinoza that belief cannot be compelled, she nevertheless affirmed the potential of certain kinds of fiction to be not only compelling but also edifying. The parallel reading of Eliot and Spinoza offered here raises the question of whether his philosophy can accommodate a theory of art in which the artist is seen to be capable of attaining and imparting dependable knowledge. When Does Truth Matter? Spinoza on the Relation between Theology and Philosophy , SUSAN JAMES One of the aims of Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus is to vindicate the view that philosophy and theology are separate forms of enquiry, neither of which has any authority over the other. However, many commentators have objected that this aspect of his project fails. Despite his protestations to the contrary, Spinoza implicitly gives epistemological precedence to philosophy. This paper argues that this objection misunderstands the nature of Spinoza's position and wrongly charges him with inconsistency. To show how he can coherently allow both that theology and philosophy employ independent epistemological standards, and that philosophy is epistemologically superior to theology, one needs to step back from the immediate disputes to which the Tractatus is a response and examine a Ciceronian distinction on which Spinoza indirectly draws. As well as enabling one to vindicate Spinoza's position, it places his alleged naturalism in a new light and portrays philosophizing as a form of piety. Mark , Image , Sign : A Semiotic Approach to Spinoza , LORENZO VINCIGUERRA Instead of reading Spinoza's account of the imagination in an anthropocentric way, as dependent on the traditional doctrine of human faculties, the author considers it as a consequence of his physics and cosmology. Knowledge by signs, as Spinoza calls imagination, has to be rooted in his theory of marks and images, and concerns all beings (human and nonhuman) that are capable of marking and being marked by other bodies in the infinite semiosis of nature. Husserl on Perceptual Constancy , MICHAEL MAD ARY In philosophy, perceptual constancy refers to the puzzling phenomenon of the perception of properties of objects despite our changing experience of those properties. Husserl developed a sophisticated description of perceptual constancy. This paper sketches Husserl's approach, which focuses on the suggestion that perception is partly constituted by the continuous interplay of intention and fulfillment. Unlike many contemporary theories, this framework gives us a way to understand the relationship between different appearances of the same object. The paper shows how Husserl's work connects with contemporary theories which emphasize perceptual constancy</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 931 from particular perspectives. These theories include appeals to perspectivai properties and Cohen's counterfactual theory. Also, the paper shows how Husserl's account shares important themes with Kelly's recent interpretation of Merleau-Ponty on perceptual constancy. Idealizing , Abstracting, and Semantic Dispositionalism , ADAM C. PODLASKOWSKI and NICHOLAOS J. JONES According to certain dispositional accounts of meaning, an agent's meaning is determined by the dispositions that an idealized version of this agent has in optimal conditions. This paper argues that such attempts cannot properly fix meaning, for even if there is a way to determine which features of an agent should be idealized without appealing to what the agent means, there is no noncircular way to determine how those features should be idealized. The paper sketches an alternative dispositional account that avoids this problem, according to which an agent's meaning is determined by the dispositions that an abstract version of this agent has in optimal conditions. - Correspondence to: apodlaskowski@fairmontstate.edu, Nick.Jones@uah.edu INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY 2012, Vol. 52, No. 1 On the Non-Bracketing of Fairy Tale in Paradox Discourse : Kierkegaard , the Analytic Tradition , and the Importance of Inclusivity , MATTHEW T. NOWACHEK Paradox is a complex notion that has assumed a diverse range of forms within philosophy, and S0ren Kierkegaard contributes one of the more interesting variations by employing a fairy tale to introduce what he identifies as the absolute paradox of the Incarnation. Despite this, more recent discussion on paradox has given little attention to Kierkegaard and has largely bracketed out any interaction with paradox that does not fit within the general analytic framework. This paper evaluates the different characteriza- tions of paradox offered by Kierkegaard and representative thinkers in the analytic tradition. It argues that the non-bracketing of Kierkegaard's fairy tale as a valid form of paradox discourse not only provides a fuller account of paradox but also offers a critique of the attempt to exclude any form of paradox from philosophical discussion that does not already conform to the restrictions of the analytic approach.</page><page sequence="14">932 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Descartes on Indeterminate Judgment and Great Deeds , KEITH G. FENNEN A critical examination of Descartes's Passions of the Soul and Discourse on Method reveals that indeterminate judgments (judgments that do not involve certainty) play a fundamental role in the Cartesian corpus. The following paper establishes this claim and argues that such an analysis provides an avenue for understanding the relationship that Descartes envisions between his Discourse and its readers as well as for understanding his attempts to establish his new science. Finally, it argues that Descartes's provocative claim in the Passions that generous souls are "naturally led to do great deeds" reveals a heroic and Aristotelian element not only in the Passions but also in Descartes's own actions. Myth and the Structure of Plato's Euthyphro , DANIEL WERNER Moving beyond the piecemeal approach to the Euthyphro that has dominated much of the previous secondary literature, this article aims to understand the dialogue as an integrated whole. The article argues that the question of myth underlies the philosophical and dialogical progression of the Euthyphro. It is an adherence to traditional myth that motivates each of Euthyphro's definitions and that also accounts for their failure. The dialogue thus presents a broad criticism of traditional myth. Yet, as Socrates's references to Daedalus and Proteus show, myth can have a positive role and can be used for philosophical purposes. J. M. Bochenski on the Rational Aspect of Weltanschauung , OTTO MUCK, S.J. J. M. Bochenski contributed to analytic philosophy of religion by investigating formal structures of religious belief and questions about its justification. Some of these features are not specific to religious convictions but are also characteristic of other kinds of worldview ( Weltanschauung ). In this article these features are developed as a philosophy of worldviews. Beyond any effort to give a psychological description or explanation of the content of a worldview, special attention needs to be paid to the rational core of one's personal worldview, for this factor shows the potentialities and the limits of the arguments that can be used in dialogue. Such dialogue is important for the reasonable growth of anyone's personal life-carrying convictions. It also helps in developing a respectful understanding of other worldviews and thus promotes cooperation. Aristotle on Beauty and Goodness in Nature , CHRISTOPHER V. MIRUS This article provides a philosophical exposition of Aristotle's claim that natural beings - precisely as beings - are intrinsically good and beautiful. The discussion attends to both living and non-living beings, and also explores the</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 933 relation between Aristotle's account of natural beauty, his teleology, and his ethics. The article concludes by exploring three objections to Aristotle's view: that many existing things are clearly bad; that the concepts "good" and "bad" apply only in relation to living things, being relevant to these not as beings but as alive; and finally, that things cannot be called good or bad in themselves, but only good or bad "for" an appropriate sort of agent. The discussion of these objections gives particular attention to the legacy of Hume's fact-value distinction. Celebrating both Singularity and Commonality: The Exemplary Originality of the Kantian Genius , YU LIU Kant's notion of genius and the related idea of exemplary originality in the Critique of Judgment have been read by Paul Guyer and Timothy Gould as implying a zero-sum game in which all creative artists are willy-nilly patricidal in relation to their predecessors and suicidal in relation to their successors. By way of challenging this interesting but ultimately repugnant reading, and especially its modernist and postmodernist frame of reference, this essay takes a close look at Kant's sustained interest in the monumental change of English garden design in the early eighteenth century and at the provocative implication of this hitherto generally overlooked interest for a radically different reading of Kant's thoughts on the exemplary originality of genius. THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY September 201 1 , Vol. 108, No. 9 On Words , JOHN HAWTHORNE and ERNEST LEPORE In his seminal paper "Words," David Kaplan addresses a pair of questions that have been largely neglected by the philosophical community: fi) Under what conditions are two utterances utterances of the same word? fii) What are words? That these questions have not received much attention is rather surprising: after all, philosophers and linguists frequently appeal to considera- tions about word and sentence identity in connection with a variety of puzzles and problems that are foundational to the very subject matter of philosophy of language and linguistics. Kaplan's attention to words is thus to be applauded. And there is no doubt that his discussion contains many useful insights. Nevertheless, his picture is deeply flawed for a variety of cross- cutting reasons. This paper aims to further advance an understanding of the nature of words, both by remedying the problems with Kaplan's account, and also by achieving a suitable perspective on what the metaphysical investigation of word identity can hope to achieve.</page><page sequence="16">934 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY October 2011, Vol. 108, No. 10 A Distinction within Egalitarianism , ALAN CARTER It is often taken for granted that egalitarians value a completely equal distribution at any moment in time of whatever it is that they believe should be distributed equally. However, an alternative form of egalitarianism may be contrasted with the variety to which it is often presupposed egalitarians subscribe. This alternative form may be called "teleological egalitarianism." Roughly, teleological egalitarianism evaluates momentary distributions according to their contribution to an overall distribution across complete lives. In contradistinction to teleological egalitarianism, what has been taken to be the traditional form may be called "nonteleological egalitarianism." This paper clarifies the distinction between teleological and nonteleological egalitarianism.

V. Quine's Word and Object , two related criticisms of Quine's philosophy have become entrenched. One is that Quine's naturalistic epistemology is descriptive, not normative, and so fails to provide an account of epistemic justification. The other is that Quine's naturalistic account of meaning leads to the absurd conclusion that our sentences are meaningless, so we cannot use them to make assertions. This paper argues that these entrenched criticisms ultimately rest on a failure to grasp Quine's resolutely minimalist understanding of language use.</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 935 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY December 201 1 , Vol. 108, No. 12 On Extending " Empiricism , Semantics , and Ontology " ¿o the Realism/Instrumentalism Controversy , WILLIAM DEMOPOULOS Causation , Norm Violation , and Culpable Control , MARK D. ALICKE, DAVID ROSE, and DORI BLOOM Causation is one of philosophy's most venerable and thoroughly- analyzed concepts. However, the study of how ordinary people make causal judgments is a much more recent addition to the philosophical arsenal. One of the most prominent views of causal explanation, especially in the realm of harmful or potentially harmful behavior, is that unusual or counternormative events are accorded privileged status in ordinary causal explanations. This is a fundamental assumption in psychological theories of counterfactual reasoning, and has been transported to philosophy by Hitchock and Knobe. A different view - the basis of the culpable control model of blame (CCM) - is that primary causal status is accorded to behaviors that arouse negative evaluative reactions, including behaviors that stem from nefarious motives, negligence or recklessness, a faulty character, or behaviors that lead to harmful or potentially harmful consequences. This paper describes four empirical studies that show consistent support for the CCM. - Correspondence to alicke@ohio.edu.

Form and Matter in Later Latin Medieval Logic : The Cases of Suppositio and Consequentia, CATARINA DUTILH NOVAES The paper investigates the influence of Aristotelian metaphysics, especially of the concepts of form and matter, in the development of Latin medieval logical theories, in particular theories of consequence and theories of supposition. More specifically, it presents the main lines in the develop- ment of the concepts of formal/material consequence and formal/material supposition in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The article suggests that the growing influence of Aristotelian metaphysics in the thirteenth century is an important element in the development of these logical theories; nevertheless, the early stages of these theories predate the rediscovery of Aristotle's metaphysics in the thirteenth century. Indeed, other relevant channels of transmission of the metaphysical concepts of form and matter to logical contexts are discussed: the Prior Analytics commentaries of the ancient commentators, Arabic texts, and the neo-Platonic metaphysics of the grammarian tradition stemming from Priscian. Spinoza on Inherence, Causation , and Conception , YITZHAK Y. MELAMED This paper suggests a new interpretation of the relations of inherence, causation and conception in Spinoza. It discusses the views of Don Garrett on this issue and argues against Delia Rocca's recent suggestion that a strict endorsement of the principle of sufficient reason leads necessarily to the identification of the relations of inherence, causation, and conception. The paper argues that (1) Spinoza never endorsed this identity, and (2) that Delia Rocca's suggestion could not be considered as a legitimate reconstruction or friendly amendment to Spinoza's system because it creates several severe and irresolvable problems in the system. The first part of the paper presents the considerations and arguments that motivated Don Garrett's and Delia Rocca's interpretations. The second part presents and examines several problems that result from Delia Rocca's reading. The third and final part (1) presents the author's view on the relation among inherence, causation, and conception; (2) offers a new interpretation of the conceived through relation in Spinoza; and finally, (3) defends and justifies the presence of (nonarbitrary) bifurcations at the very center of Spinoza's system.</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 937 The Metaphysical Fact of Consciousness in Locke's Theory of Personal Identity , SHELLEY WEINBERG This paper makes the textual argument why one should read Locke as having a conception of a metaphysical fact of a continuing consciousness that does not appeal to thinking or bodily substance to establish its continuity. That is, consciousness is something that endures through our momentary conscious states of ourselves even if the full duration of a continuing consciousness is known only by God. The paper then argues that the metaphysical fact of an enduring consciousness is revealed to us as a phenomenological fact of experience. Due to the nature of certain kinds of perceptual situations we have an experience of ourselves as temporally extended. Nevertheless, the metaphysical fact of consciousness is philosophically distinguished from the phenomenological fact. Although the text bears out that Locke seemed to think there is a fact of an ongoing consciousness, the article argues that it is consistent with his reluctance elsewhere that he makes no further epistemologica! or ontological claims about it. Finally, the paper provides an account of Locke's understanding of memory and its relation to consciousness that supports the claim that consciousness is something ontologically distinct from both thinking and bodily substance. The Generality ofKanťs Transcendental Logic , CLINTON TOLLEY What is the nature of Kant's new "transcendental" logic, and how is it to differ from the traditional logic? Many have argued that transcendental logic is distinguished by the domain of understanding it investigates - whether by focusing on a domain excluded from traditional logic, or by focusing a more specific domain. This essay argues that transcendental logic should not be characterized by a difference in domain at all, but rather in terms of the aspect of understanding at issue: while traditional logic investigates the form of understanding, transcendental logic studies its content. This interpretation fits better with Kant's claim that the transcendental-logical categories and the traditional-logical forms "completely coincide." It also clarifies Kant's doc- trine of the spontaneity of our understanding, by highlighting what our understanding is capable of achieving on its own.

WEINBERG, JOSHUA ALEXANDER, CHAD GONNERMAN, and SHANE REUTER It is increasingly popular to respond to experimental philosophy by suggesting that experimental philosophers have not been studying the right things. One version of this response, the reflection defense, involves suggesting that philosophers are interested only in reflective intuitions and that these have not yet been (and possibly cannot be) studied experimentally. As a defensive move, this suggestion works only if reflective intuitions are immune from the problematic effects that form the basis of recent experimental challenges to philosophy's intuition-deploying practices. If they are not (or at least not sufficiently less sensitive), then the fact that experimental philosophers have not investigated the right intuitions would provide little comfort to folks invested in philosophy's intuition-deploying practices. This paper provides reasons to worry that even reflective intuitions can be problematically sensitive, although possibly in slightly different ways. As it turns out, being reflective might sometimes just mean being wrong in a different way. - Correspondence to: jmweinberg@email.arizona.edu Experiments on Aristotle's Thesis : Towards an Experimental Philosophy of Conditionals , NIKI PFEIFER Two experiments investigate two versions of Aristotle's Thesis for the first time. Aristotle's Thesis is a negated conditional, which consists of one propositional variable with a negation either in the antecedent (version 1) or in the consequent (version 2). This task allows one to infer if people interpret indicative conditionals (if A, then B) as material conditionals , A 3 B, or as conditional events , B I A. The first experiment investigates between- participants the two versions of Aristotle's Thesis crossed with abstract versus concrete task material. The modal response for all four groups is consistent with the conditional event and inconsistent with the material conditional interpretation. This observation is replicated in the second experiment. Moreover, the second experiment rules out scope ambiguities of the negation of conditionals. Both experiments provide new evidence against the material conditional interpretation of conditionals and support the conditional event interpretation. Finally, the author discusses implications for modeling indicative conditionals and the relevance of this work for ex- perimental philosophy.-Correspondence to: niki.pfeifer@lrz.uni-muenchen.de Can Folk Aesthetics Ground Aesthetic Realism? FLORIAN COVA and NICOLAS PAIN Aesthetic Realism claims, first, that common sense is realist about aesthetic judgments because it considers that aesthetic judgments are normative, that is, can be right or wrong, and, second, that because Aesthetic Realism comes from and accounts for "folk aesthetics," it is the best theory available in Aesthetic Philosophy. Using a methodology developed in</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 939 Experimental Philosophy, this paper depicts three experiments designed to determine to what extent normativity is a property of folk's aesthetic judgments, and thus to test empirically the foundations of Aesthetic Realism. The results show that common sense does not endorse the idea that aesthetic judgments are normative, and thus that it is not realist and cannot provide a ground for Aesthetic Realism. The last sections address methodological and theoretical objections to the protocol and its results, and provide insights about aesthetic philosophy as a research field without the normative assump- tion that aesthetic judgments are intrinsically normative. - Correspondence to: florian.cova@gmail.com, mikolka.mikolka@gmail.com The Centrality of Belief and Reflection in Knobe Effect Cases : A Unified Account of the Data , MARK ALFANO, JAMES R. BEEBE, and BRIAN ROBINSON Recent work in experimental philosophy has shown that people are more likely to attribute intentionality, knowledge, and other psychological properties to someone who causes a bad side effect than to someone who causes a good one. This paper argues that all of these asymmetries can be explained in terms of a single underlying asymmetry involving belief attribution because the belief that one's action would result in a certain side effect is a necessary component of each of the psychological attitudes in question. The paper argues further that this belief-attribution asymmetry is rational because it mirrors a belief-formation asymmetry, and that the belief- formation asymmetry is also rational because it is more useful to form some beliefs than others. - Correspondence to: mark.alfano@gmail.com The Indeterminist Intuition : Source and Status , SHAUN NICHOLS Evidence from experimental philosophy indicates that people think that their choices are not determined. What remains unclear is why people think this. Denying determinism is rather presumptuous given people's general ignorance about the nature of the universe. This paper argues that the belief in indeterminism depends on a default presumption that we know the factors that influence our decision making. That presumption was reasonable at earlier points in intellectual history. But in light of work in cognitive science, we are no longer justified in sustaining the presupposition that we know what influences our choices. As a result, to the extent that we believe in indeter- minist choice because of this faulty presupposition, our belief in indeterminist choice is unjustified. - Correspondence: sbn@email.arizona.edu WINO Epistemology and The Shifting Sands Problem , CHRISTOPHER ZARPENTINE, HEATHER CIPOLLETTI, and MICHAEL BISHOP Experimental epistemology supports the Diversity Thesis, that different people have systematically different and incompatible packages of epistemic</page><page sequence="22">940 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS intuitions. This raises the specter of the shifting-sands problem: the evidence base for epistemology contains systematic inconsistencies. In response to this problem, some philosophers deny the Diversity Thesis, others flirt with denying the Evidence Thesis, that the epistemic intuition that p is prima facie evidence that p is true. The authors propose to accept both theses and live with the shifting-sands problem. Expanding epistemology's evidential base so as to include scientific evidence can provide principled grounds on which to decide between incompatible intuitions. Although this is simply Wide Reflec- tive Equilibrium, it may seem radical because many traditional epis- temologists practice reflective equilibrium that is WINO, Wide In Name Only.

This paper critically assesses one prominent example of this challenge, namely, Swain, Alexander and Weinberg's recent study of order effects on Truetemp intuitions. It argues that the very data that Swain, Alexander, and Weinberg find do not undermine, but instead support, the reliability of intuition. The paper also shows how intuition can itself be marshaled in the service of figuring out just when we can and cannot expect to find order effects on our intuitions. THE MONIST July 201 2, Vol. 95, No. 3 The Disunity of Morality and Why It Matters to Philosophy , WALTER SINNOTT-ARMSTRONG AND THALIA WHEATLEY Whenever psychologists, neuroscientists, or philosophers draw con- clusions about moral judgments in general from a small selected sample, they assume that moral judgments are unified by some common and peculiar feature that enables generalizations and makes morality worthy of study as a unified field. This article assesses this assumption by considering the six main candidates for a unifying feature: content, phenomenology, force, form, function, and brain mechanisms. The conclusion is that moral judgment is not unified on any of these levels and that moral science should adopt a more fine-grained taxonomie approach that studies small and carefully defined groups of moral judgments.

The idea of modulation, however, suggests that there may be optimal levels of cognition, conation, and mood and the neurotransmitters that regulate them. Manipulating the brain and mind beyond these levels through psycho- pharmacology or neurostimulation may weaken rather than enhance the will. Moral Enhancement , Freedom and the God Machine , JULIAN SAVULESCU and INGMAR PERSSON This paper reviews the possibilities for using advances in the neurosciences and biological sciences to enhance people's moral dispositions and behavior - moral enhancement. It examines one objection to moral en- hancement that it would undermine freedom. It begins by examining what would count as a moral enhancement: increased altruism (including increased empathy, sympathy, and willingness to self-sacrifice), reduced violence and aggressions, increased willingness to co-operate, and impulse control. The paper argues that enhancing these together would not undermine freedom. Such enhancements would not undermine our capacity to act according to reasons; in fact, they would increase this capacity and in some cases increase autonomy. However, for argument's sake, the paper considers a kind of intervention that would promote more moral behavior that does eliminate freedom: the God Machine. This removes the freedom to perform grossly immoral acts by changing people's minds without their knowledge. The paper argues that freedom is only one value and such an intervention could nonetheless be justified despite loss of freedom to commit grossly immoral acts, in certain circumstances. Another Scientific Threat to Free Will? ALFRED MELE This article's topic is scientific arguments for the nonexistence of free will that include the premise that our having free will depends on the truth of substance dualism. Based partly on some empirical work on what lay folk mean by "free will," that premise is called into question. The article also discusses a recent fMRI study of free will and proposes that before we make a judgment about whether particular data threaten the existence of free will, asking ourselves how free will would need to be understood in order for the threat to be a genuine one may often prove useful. - Correspondence to: almele@fsu.edu</page><page sequence="24">942 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Beyond Button Presses : The Neuroscience of Free and Morally Appraisable Actions , ROBYN REPKO WALLER What are the types of action at issue in the free will and moral responsibility debate? Are the neuroscientists who make claims about free will and moral responsibility studying those types of action? If not, can the existing paradigm in the field be modified to study those types of action? This paper outlines some claims made by neuroscientists about the inefficacy of conscious intentions and the implications of this inefficacy for the existence of free will. It argues that, typically, the types of actions at issue in the philosophical literature require proximal or distal conscious decisions and have the right kind of connection to reasons. It points out that neuro- scientists are not studying this class of actions, as their studies focus on simple commanded actions (for example, finger flex) and simple Buridan choices (for example, push the left or right button). Finally, it argues that neuroscience already has the resources to study the types of action relevant for free will and moral responsibility and outlines two experiments which focus on skilled actions arid moral choices that could be run using the available technology. - Correspondence to: rrepko@fsu.edu Neuroscience and the Problem of Other Animal Minds: Why It May Not Matter So Much for Neuroethics , ANDREW FENTON A recent argument has suggested that brain-mental-state identities promise to settle epistemological uncertainties about nonhuman animal minds. What's more, these brain-mental-state identities promise to dismantle the deadlock over the moral status of nonhuman animals. The author argues that neuroscientific claims assuming brain-mental-state identities do not so much resolve the problem of other animal minds as mark its resolution. In the meantime, we must rely on the tools available to us, including those provided by the behavioral sciences. Focusing on captive animal research, the author also argues that humane experimentalists do not doubt that many of their research subjects have minds (in some substantive sense of that term). In that light, to suggest that the resolution of the problem of other animal minds would change the scientific use of animals misses the mark. What is required is a "sea change" in the perceived grounds for human moral obligations to nonhumans. - Correspondence to:andrew.fenton@gmail.com. Primitive Self-Consciousness and Avian Cognition , ANDY LAMEY Recent work in moral theory has seen the refinement of theories of moral standing, which increasingly recognize a position of intermediate standing between fully self-conscious entities and those which are merely conscious. Among the most sophisticated concepts now used to denote such intermediate standing is that of primitive self-consciousness, which has been used to more precisely elucidate the moral standing of human newborns. New research into the structure of the avian brain offers a revised view of the cognitive abilities of birds. When this research is approached with a species- specific focus, it appears likely that one familiar species, the chicken (Gallus</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 943 gallus domesticus), also exhibits primitive self-consciousness. Given the likelihood that they are primitively self-consciousness, chickens warrant a degree of moral standing that falls short of that enjoyed by persons, but which exceeds the minimal standing of merely conscious entities. - Correspon- dence to: andy.lamey@monash.edu The Ethics of Alien Attitudes , JUHA RÂIKKÁ and SAUL SMILANSKY People do not always really believe what they take themselves to believe. Sometimes a person may report having an attitude which conflicts with his better judgment - his opinion. In these cases the person's (evidential) beliefs are not apparent to the person in the normal way, and are not judgment- sensitive (or reason-responsive) in a way that they are supposed to be. Beliefs of this kind can be called alien attitudes, or more narrowly, alien beliefs. They are attitudes or beliefs that fail to be sensitive to the person's regular processes of introspection and evaluation and are known by him merely through behavioral and psychological evidence that he has noticed about himself, or learned about himself from others. When a person is aware of his beliefs in this way, he is not committed to their truth or overall acceptability; he has not endorsed them. This article explores some issues that pertain to the ethics of such attitudes. - Correspondence to jraikka @utu.fi THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY January 2012, Vol. 62, No. 247 Expanding The Situationist Challenge to Responsibilist Virtue Epistemologi /, MARK ALFANO The last few decades have witnessed the birth and growth of both virtue epistemology and the situationist challenge to virtue ethics. It seems only natural that eventually we would see the situationist challenge to virtue epistemology. This article articulates one aspect of that new challenge by spelling out an argument against the responsibilist brand of virtue epistemo- logy. The trouble can be framed as an inconsistent triad: many people know quite a bit (non-skepticism); knowledge is true belief acquired and retained through the exercise of intellectual virtue (responsibilism); most people do not possess the intellectual virtues countenanced by responsibilism (episte- mic situationism). Non-skepticism is a Moorean platitude we should aim to preserve at most if not all costs. This article musters evidence from cognitive and social psychology to argue for epistemic situationism. If this argument is correct, responsibilism must be revised or rejected, and reliabilists should avoid incorporating responsibilist components into their theories.</page><page sequence="26">944 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Leibniz's Mill Arguments against Materialism , STEWART DUNCAN Leibniz's mill argument in "Monadology" 17 is a well-known but puzzling argument against materialism about the mind. This essay approaches the mill argument by considering other places where Leibniz gave similar arguments, using the same example of the machinery of a mill and reaching the same anti- materialist conclusion. In a 1702 letter to Bayle, Leibniz gave a mill argument that moves from his definition of perception (as the expression of a multitude by a simple) to the anti-materialist conclusion. Soon afterwards, in the Preface to the New Essays , Leibniz gave a different mill argument. That argument depends upon there being no arbitrary and inexplicable connections in nature, because God would not create such things. Later, in the "Monadology," Leibniz again used the mill example in arguing against materialism. That passage too, the essay argues, uses an argument from inexplicability rather than from Leibniz's definition of perception. Invigilating Republican Liberty , GERALD LANG Republican liberty, as recently defended by Philip Pettit and Quentin Skinner, characterizes liberty in terms of the absence of domination, instead of, or in addition to, the absence of interference, as favored by Berlin-style negative liberty. This article considers several claims made on behalf of republican liberty, particularly in Pettit's and Skinner's recent writings, and finds them wanting. It contends that no relevant moral or political concern expressed by republicans fails to be accommodated by negative liberty. What Are Centered Worlds? SHEN-YI LIAO David Lewis argues that centered worlds give us a way to capture de se , or self-locating, contents in philosophy of language and philosophy of mind. In recent years, centered worlds have also gained other uses in areas ranging widely from metaphysics to ethics. This paper raises a problem for centered worlds and discusses the costs and benefits of different solutions. The present investigation into the nature of centered worlds helps to explicate potentially problematic implicit commitments of the theories that employ them. In addition, this investigation reveals that the conception of centered worlds widely attributed to David Lewis is not only problematic, but is in fact not his. Multiple Groundings and Deference , ANTONIO RAUTI The idea that reference is multiply grounded allows causal-historical theories of reference to account for reference change. It also threatens the stability of reference in light of widespread error and confusion.

The possibility that the aggregation's outcome be logically inconsistent, even though it is based on consistent individual judgments, arises relatively easily and has been the subject of several investigations. This paper shows that this paradoxical behavior is the effect of decision procedures that are unable to discriminate between logically consistent and logically inconsistent individual judgments. The paradoxes can be resolved by selecting procedures that are not affected by this limitation. A Puzzle about Withholding , JOHN TURRI This paper presents a puzzle about justification and withholding. The puzzle arises in a special case where experts advise us to not withhold judgment. The main thesis is simply that the puzzle is genuinely a puzzle, and so leads us to rethink some common assumptions in epistemology, specifically assumptions about the nature of justification and doxastic attitudes. After articulating the puzzle, this article goes on to consider and evaluate different solutions to it. Explanation and the New Riddle of Induction, BARRY WARD This essay proposes a novel solution to Goodman's new riddle of induction, one on which aspects of scientific methodology preclude significant confirmation of the Grue Hypothesis. The solution appeals to intuitive constraints on the confirmation of explanatory hypotheses, and can be construed as a fragment of a theory of Inference to the Best Explanation. The essay gives it an objective Bayesian formalisation, and contrasts it with solutions of Goodman and Sober, which appeal to both methodological and nonmethodological considerations, and those of Jackson, Godfrey-Smith, and White, in which explanatory considerations play a very different role.

HOLLIDAY According to the Principle of the Fixity of the Past (FP), no one can now do anything that would require the past to have unfolded differently than it actually did, for the past is fixed, over and done with. Why might doing something in the future require the past to be different? Because if determinism is true - if the laws of nature and the initial conditions of the Big Bang determined a unique future for our universe - then doing anything other than what you are determined to do would require one of two things: either a miracle, a violation of the actual laws of nature, or a different past, all the way back to the Big Bang or beyond. Which would it be? Those who reject miracles accept a Backtracking Principle (BT), according to which the past would (have to) be different. If this is correct, then it follows by (FP) that you cannot now do anything other than what you are determined to do. The conclusion of this much-discussed argument is that the freedom to do otherwise is incompatible with determinism. In order to break a stalemate between incompatibilists and compatibilists in the debate over (FP), this article presents a new Action-Type Argument for (FP). The aim is to refute Backtracking Compatibilism, the view that (BT) is true and yet the freedom to do otherwise is compatible with determinism. The form of the Action-Type Argument for (FP) also leads to a Simple Argument for incompatibilism, which does not assume (BT). What the Simple Argument does assume is a "governing" view of laws of nature, a view of laws as more than mere regularities that turn out to be exceptionless over all time. Incompatibilism follows. Deliberation and Acting for Reasons, NOMY ARPALY and TIMOTHY SCHROEDER Theoretical and practical deliberation are voluntary activities, and like all voluntary activities, they are performed for reasons. To hold that all voluntary activities are performed for reasons in virtue of their relations to past, present, or even merely possible acts of deliberation thus leads to infinite regresses and related problems. As a consequence, there must be pro- cesses that are nondeliberative and nonvoluntary but that nonetheless allow us to think and act for reasons, and these processes must be the ones that generate the voluntary activities making up ordinary deliberation. These nondeliberative, nonvoluntary processes by means of which we are able to deliberate for reasons are the fundamental processes by means of which we can think or do anything for a reason: once it has been seen that they must exist, it can be recognized that they are ubiquitous. As a result, the usefulness of deliberation to rational belief and action is intermittent, contingent, and modest. Deliberation is a tremendously valuable tool for increasing human</page><page sequence="29">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 947 capacities to think and act for good reasons in challenging contexts, but in the end it is merely a tool, wielded by people through nondeliberative, non- voluntary capacities to think and act for reasons. Accuracy , Chance , and the Principal Principle , RICHARD PETTIGREW In "A Nonpragmatic Vindication of Probabilism," James M. Joyce attempts to "depragmatize" de Finetti's prevision argument for the claim that our credences ought to satisfy the axioms of the probability calculus. This article adapts Joyce's argument to give nonpragmatic vindications of David Lewis's original Principal Principle as well as recent reformulations motivated by Ned Hall and Jenann Ismael. Joyce enumerates properties that a function must have if it is to measure the distance from a set of credences to a set of truth values; he shows that, on any such measure, and for any set of credences that violates the probability axioms, there is a set that satisfies those axioms that is closer to every possible set of truth values. This article replaces truth values with objective chances in this argument; it shows that for any set of credences that violates the probability axioms or the Principal Principle, there is a set that satisfies both that is closer to every possible set of objective chances and similarly for Ned Hall's New Principle and Jenann Ismael's Generalized Principal Principle. Along the way, the article provides new arguments for some of Joyce's central conditions on distance measures, and it answers two pressing objections to Joyce's strategy. On the Supposed Inconceivability of Absent Qualia Functional Duplicates - A Reply to Tye , ROBERT VAN GULICK In "Absent Qualia and the Mind-Body Problem," Michael Tye presents an argument by which he claims to show the inconceivability of beings that are functionally equivalent to phenomenally conscious beings but lack any qualia. On that basis, he concludes that qualia can be fully defined in functional terms. The argument does not suffice to establish the claimed results. In particular it does not show that such absent qualia cases are inconceivable. Tye's argument relies on a principle P according to which the exchange of isomorphic states between functionally equivalent systems will preserve their equivalence. If they were functionally equivalent before the exchange, they will also be so after it. Consideration of the contextual nature of realization shows that Principle P is not a general truth as Tye claims, and his argument against the possibility of absent qualia thus fails.</page><page sequence="30">948 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS PHILOSOPHY April 2012, Vol. 87, No. 2* When Should Philosophers Be Silent?

Some are quite general, and suggest that it is best never to engage in philosophical inquiry, while others are more domain or context specific. This essay argues that these arguments fail to establish their conclusions. It does, however, try to identify and defend several substantive constraints on philosophical dialogue and inquiry. In practice, though, respecting these constraints need not lead to much philosophical silence. - Correspondence to: j.decker@carleton.edu Hume on the Passions , STEPHEN BUCKLE Hume's account of the passions is largely neglected because the author's purposes tend to be missed. The passions were accepted by early modern philosophers, of whatever persuasion, as the mental effects of bodily processes. The dualist and the materialist differed over whether reason is a higher power able to judge and control them: thus Descartes affirms, whereas Hobbes denies, this possibility. Hume's account lines up firmly behind Hobbes. Although he shies away from Hobbes's dogmatic physiological claims, he affirms all the key elements of the psychology Hobbes based on them: the nature of the will, the compatibility of freedom and necessity, the subservience of reason to passion, and the motivating power of pleasure and pain. Hume's account is thus best regarded as implicitly materialist. It is not, however, merely disinterested analysis: it aims at criticism of orthodox religious values. The passions are not threats to morality, but virtuous or vicious according to their pleasurable or painful nature. Thus the status of pride and humility is reversed. Hume's account of the passions underpins a rejection of orthodox religious morals, and endorses the values of antiquity, namely, of pagan virtue. - Correspondence to: s.buckle@plunkett.acu.edu.au Dogs and Concepts , ALICE CRARY This article is a contribution to discussions about the prospects for a viable conceptualism, that is, a viable view that represents our modes of awareness as conceptual all the way down.

Its main argument starts from the conceptualist doctrine defended in the writings of John McDowell. Although critics are wrong to represent McDowell as implying that animals are mindless brutes, it is difficult to see what is wrong with this unless we depart from McDowell's technical terminology and introduce a notion of a concept flexible enough to apply to the lives of some nonrational animals. The article closes with a discussion of observations that speak for attributing concepts, flexibly understood, to dogs. - Corres- pondence to: crarya@newschool.edu Epistemic Restraint and the Vice of Curiosity , NEIL C. MANSON In recent years there has been wide-ranging discussion of epistemic virtues. Given the value and importance of acquiring knowledge this discussion has tended to focus upon those traits that are relevant to the acquisition of knowledge. This acquisitionist focus ignores or downplays the importance of epistemic restraint: refraining from seeking knowledge. In contrast, in many periods of history, curiosity was viewed as a vice. By drawing upon critiques of curiositas in Middle Platonism and Early Christian philosophy, we gain useful insights into the value and importance of epistemic restraint. The historical discussion paves the way for a clarification of epistemic restraint, one that distinguishes the morally relevant features of epistemic process, content, purpose, and context. Epistemic restraint is identified as an important virtue where our epistemic pursuits pose risks and burdens, where such pursuits have opportunity costs, and where they are pursued for vicious purposes. It is in the social realm, however, that epistemic restraint has most purchase: epistemic restraint is important because both privacy and being trusted are important. Finally, some suggestions are offered as to why epistemic restraint has not received the contemporary attention that it deserves. - Correspondence to: n.manson @lancaster.ac.uk Believing in Reincarnation , MIKEL BURLEY Is it absurd to believe that, in the absence of bodily continuity, personal identity could be retained? Bernard Williams argued for an affirmative answer to this question partly on the basis of a well known thought experiment. Some other philosophers, including D. Z. Phillips, have accepted, or appear to have accepted, Williams's conclusion. Yet the argument has the consequence of dismissing as absurd the sorts of reincarnation beliefs which, within their proper contexts, have a meaningful role in the lives of many millions of people. Drawing upon philosophical work by David Cockburn, and also on anthropological studies concerning reincarnation beliefs, this paper questions the extent to which ostensibly meaningful beliefs can be deemed unintelligible in the absence of careful attention to their cultural contexts. - Correspondence to: m.m.burley@leeds.ac.uk</page><page sequence="32">950 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS The Words of Others, LLOYD REINHARDT The great bulk of what we are pleased to deem knowledge comes to us via the words of others. But such knowledge is limited to (mere) information or plain fact. Theoretical, Ethical, and Aesthetic discourse are three regions in which, even when we accept the words of others, we transmit content with what the article dubs prefaces, not flatly, not in our own voice. Explanation of this is suggested: in these regions assertions claim truth without claiming knowledge. So, fact-theory and fact-value differ from plain fact for similar reasons, reasons which alleviate the urge to downgrade ethical discourse to the expressive or prescriptive. - Correspondence to: lreinhar@bigpond.net.au PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH March 2012, Vol. 84, No. 2 Group Testimony? The Making of A Collective Good Informant , MIRANDA FRICKER This article discusses the significant role of a good informant, particularly in a group testimony setting. It presents the theory of Edward Craig about the distinction between a good informant and a source of information. It proposes a method for forming a group commitment to trustworthiness through Margaret Gilbert's concept of joint commitment. How We Feel About Terrible , Non-existent Mafiosi , TYLER DOGGETT and ANDY EGAN The article presents an explanation about the affective responses of individuals at sports events, theatrical productions, and other real and fictional creations. It suggests that the source of anxious feelings in such situations is due to the presence of cognitive and conative components of human brains, noting that the cognitive component is one's imagination about what will happen next, while the conative aspect is one's belief about what will occur. Methodological Encounters with the Phenomenal Kind , NICHOLAS SHEA Block's well-known distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness has generated a large philosophical literature about putative conceptual connections between the two. The scientific literature about whether they come apart in any actual cases is rather smaller. Empirical evidence gathered to date has not settled the issue. Some put this</page><page sequence="33">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 951 down to a fundamental methodological obstacle to the empirical study of the relation between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. Block has drawn attention to the methodological puzzle and attempted to answer it. While the evidence Block points to is relevant and important, this paper puts forward a more systematic framework for addressing the puzzle. The approach of this article is to study phenomenal consciousness as a natural kind. This approach allows consciousness studies to move beyond initial means of identifying instances of the kind like verbal report and to find the underlying nature of phenomenal consciousness. It is well-recognized that facts about an underlying kind may allow identification of instances of the kind that do not match the initial means of identification (for example, in attempting to identify non-liquid samples of water). This paper shows that the same method can be employed to investigate phenomenal consciousness independently of access consciousness. Meaningfulness and Time , ANTTI KAUPPINEN The article presents a theory about the meaning of life through illustrating fictional and real life experiences. It offers an understanding of the concept of meaningfulness, particularly in terms of emotions of fulfillment and admiration. It concludes that a meaningful life can be assessed on the appropriateness of these feelings. Objective Being and "Ofness" in Descartes , LIONEL SHAPIRO It is generally assumed that Descartes invokes "objective being in the intellect" in order to explain or describe an idea's status as being "of something." This paper argues that this assumption is mistaken. As emerges in his discussion of "materially false ideas" in the Fourth Reply, Descartes recognizes two senses of "idea of." One, a theoretical sense, is itself intro- duced in terms of objective being. Hence Descartes cannot be introducing objective being to explain or describe "ofness" understood in this sense. Descartes also appeals to a pretheoretical sense of "idea of." The paper argues that the notion of objective being cannot serve to explain or describe this "ofness" either. It concludes by proposing an alternative explanation of the role of objective being, according to which Descartes introduces this notion to explain the minďs ability to attain clear and distinct ideas. Self-Support, EARL CONEE This essay discusses the self-support aspect of a proposition and the skeptical doubts that arise because of it. It offers examples of self-evidence phenomena, including statements such as "any thing is something," "sourness is not a color," and "anything that is square is extended." It examines the capacity of such statements to justify themselves through various propositions using mathematics, logic, and philosophy.</page><page sequence="34">952 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS PHRONESIS 2012, Vol. 57, No. 2 The Symposium and Platonic Ethics: Plato , Vlastos , and a Misguided Debate , FRISBEE SHEFFIELD Scholarship on the Symposium is dominated by a debate on interpersonal love started by Gregory Vlastos in his article, "The Individual as an Object of Love in Plato." This paper argues that this debate is a misguided one, because it is not reflective of the central concerns of this text. Attention needs to be turned to the broader ethical questions posed about the ends of life, the nature of human happiness, and contemplation. Failure to do so will mean that the Symposium continues to be eclipsed as a key resource in central debates in Platonic ethics. - Correspondence to: fccs2@cam.ac.uk Why Does Aristotle Think That Ethical Virtue Is Required for Practical Wisdom? URSULA COOPE This paper asks why Aristotle thinks that ethical virtue (rather than mere self-control) is required for practical wisdom. It argues that a satisfactory answer will need to explain why being prone to bad appetites implies a failing of the rational part of the soul. The paper goes on to claim that the self- controlled person does suffer from such a rational failing: a failure to take a specifically rational kind of pleasure in fine action. However, this still leaves a problem: could there not be someone who (unlike the self-controlled person) took the right kind of pleasure in fine action, but who failed to be virtuous on account of bad appetites? If so, would such a person be practically wise but not virtuous? The paper ends with some suggestions about how Aristotle might answer this. - Correspondence to: ursula.coope@philosophy.ox.ac.uk Pores and Void in Asclepiades9 Physical Theory , DAVID LEITH This paper examines a fundamental, though relatively understudied, aspect of the physical theory of the physician Asclepiades of Bithynia, namely his doctrine of pores. My principal thesis is that this doctrine is dependent on a conception of void taken directly from Epicurean physics. The paper falls into two parts: the first half addresses the evidence for the presence of void in Asclepiades' theory, and concludes that his conception of void was basically that of Epicurus; the second half focuses on the precise nature of Asclepiadean pores, and seeks to show that they represent void interstices between the primary particles of matter that constitute the human body, and are thus exactly analogous to the void interstices between atoms within solid objects in Epicurus' theory. - Correspondence to: dl383@cam.ac.uk</page><page sequence="35">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 953 Aristotle Book Notes , BENJAMIN MORISON The article focuses on several publications on Aristotle in 2012.

RATIO June 2012, Vol. 25, No. 2 The Triplism of Practical Reason , JOHN SKORUPSK3 There can be reasons for belief, for action, and for feeling. In each case, knowledge of such reasons requires nonempirical knowledge of some truths about them: these will be truths about what there is reason to believe, to feel, or to do - either outright or on condition of certain facts obtaining. These a priori truths about reasons may be called "norms." Norms are a priori true propositions about reasons. It is an epistemic norm that if something is a good explanation that is a reason to believe it. It is an evaluative norm that if someone has cheated you that is a reason to be annoyed with them. There are many evaluative norms, relating to a variety of feelings. Likewise, there may be various epistemic norms, even though in this case they all relate to belief. The concern of this article, however, is practical norms: a priori truths about what there is reason to do. This article provides a suggestion regarding what fundamental practical norms there are. The author's aim is to set these norms out and sketch some questions which arise from this "triplism of practical reason." In particular, since these norms are about practical reasons, not about morality, the paper considers how moral obligation comes onto the scene. - Correspondence to: jms2@st-andrews.ac.uk Half-Truths , JOEL J. KUPPERMAN Half-truths are statements that have some insight or truth in them, but do not amount to a final or definitive truth that all competent judges should be able to accept. Complete truth requires that the relevant interpretative structures can be taken for granted, and can be expected to be understood by all competent language users. Disciplines such as philosophy, history, and sociology do contain a small number of complete truths, concerning some logical relations or such matters as the year of Columbus' arrival in the new world or recorded vote totals in some elections. But most of what they yield (the most interesting part) consists of half-truths. - Correspondence to: joel.kupperman@uconn.edu</page><page sequence="36">954 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Iris Murdoch and the Borders of Analytic Philosophy , TONY MILLIGAN Iris Murdoch's philosophical texts depart significantly from familiar analytic discursive norms. (Such as the norms concerning argument structure and the minimization of rhetoric.) This may lead us to adopt one of two strategies. On the one hand, there is an assimilation strategy that involves translation of Murdoch's claims into the more familiar terms of property- realism (the terminology of ethical naturalism and non-naturalism). On the other hand, there is the option of adopting a crossover strategy and reading Murdoch as (in some sense) a philosopher who belongs more properly to the continental tradition. The following article argues that if familiar Quinean claims about ontological commitment and Murdoch's account of metaphor are both broadly correct then the assimilation strategy must fail to produce a faithful translation. Nonetheless, Murdoch's connection to the analytic tradition is more than genealogical, it is more than a matter of her writing initially in response to analytic contemporaries before branching off in a more continental direction. While she departs from familiar analytic discursive norms, she continues to accept most of the epistemic values (such as clarity and simplicity) that the norms embody. - Correspondence to: tmilligan @abdn.ac.uk Multi-Dimensional Consequentialism , MARTIN PETERSON This article introduces and explores a distinction between multi- dimensional and one-dimensional consequentialist moral theories. One- dimensional consequentialists believe that an act's deontic status depends on just one aspect of the act, such as the sum total of wellbeing it produces, or the sum total of priority- or equality-adjusted wellbeing. Multi-dimensional consequentialists believe that an act's deontic status depends on more than one aspect. They may, for instance, believe that the sum total of wellbeing produced by an act and the degree to which the wellbeing is equally distributed in the population affect the act's deontic status independently of each other. These two aspects cannot be reduced into any single (composite) aspect. Wellbeing and equality are two separate considerations that cannot be merged into some novel entity that accurately reflects both intuitions. On the multi-dimensional view the article defends, such clashes between separate aspects are irresolvable and are best accounted for by claiming that moral lightness and wrongness are non-binary concepts. Some acts are, literally speaking, a little bit right (because they maximize wellbeing) and a little bit wrong (because they do not maximize equality). - Correspondence to: m.peterson@tue.nl Two Challenges That Categorical Properties Pose to Physicalism , ROBERT SCHROER What are physical objects like when they are considered independently of their causal interactions? Many think that the answer to this question involves categorical properties - properties that make contributions to their</page><page sequence="37">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 955 bearers that are independent of any causal interactions those objects may enter into. This paper examines two challenges that this solution poses to Physicalism. The first challenge is that, given that they are distinct from any of the scientifically described causal powers that they happen to convey, categorical properties will not qualify as being "physical" properties. Given the right definition of "physical," this challenge can be overcome. The article argues, however, that the only way we can have a positive grasp of the nature of categorical properties is via "acquaintance" - a non-physical relation. This second challenge to Physicalism cannot be overcome. - Correspondence to: rschroer@d.umn.edu A Problem about the Morality of Some Common Forms of Prayer, SAUL SMILANSKY At a time of acute danger, people commonly petition God for help for themselves or their loved ones; such as praying that an avalanche heading in one's direction be diverted, or that an organ donor be found for one's dying child. Such prayer seems natural and, indeed, for believers, reasonable and acceptable. It seems perverse to condemn such typical prayer as wrong. Once one closely examines what is actually happening in such situations, however, one sees that frequently, prayer of this sort is morally problematic. This essay argues that such prayer ought to be seen as a form of action (rather than, say, mere hope), thereby needing to meet the higher moral standards that apply to actions; and that the assumption of the benevolence of the deity does not suffice to make such prayer legitimate. - Correspondence to: smilsaul@research.haifa.ac.il Epistemic Value and Achievement , DANIEL WHITING Knowledge seems to be a good thing, or at least better than epistemic states that fall short of it, such as true belief. Understanding too seems to be a good thing, perhaps better even than knowledge. In a number of recent publications, Duncan Pritchard tries to account for the value of understanding by claiming that understanding is a cognitive achievement and that achievements in general are valuable. This paper argues that coming to understand something need not be an achievement, and so Pritcharďs explanation of understanding's value fails. Next, it points out that Pritcharďs is just one of many attempts to account for the value of an epistemic state - whether it be understanding, knowledge, or whatever - by appeal to the notion of achievement or, more generally, the notion of success because of ability. The paper suggests reasons to be skeptical about the prospects of any such account. - Correspondence to: d.whiting@soton.ac.uk</page></plain_text>
