<plain_text><page sequence="1">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT' BY ERIC OSBORN Early in the last century, Adolf von Harnack claimed that 'Clement of Alexandria is the one, devoutly Christian and truly open-minded, theolo gian in the ancient church'.2 That century has offered a rich harvest which points to Clement's two sources: scripture as ordered by kerygma, and phi losophy as method and accumulated wisdom. He shares the kerygma which was set out by Irenaeus (One divine intellect, economy, recapitulation and participation) and which includes but is not confined to the threefold rule of faith. From the kerygma, the divine plan/economy dominates scripture, which Clement quotes more than 5000 times.3 Scripture is the new Christian bible. The divine plan/economy is both a grand scheme and the continuous salvific proximity of God to humans.

Each of these two sources scripture and philosophy has emerged in the contrapuntal contributions concerning Clement of the last century. De Faye. Gospel and philosophy Clement began the twentieth century with three books, which set the stage for subsequent work. The first was that of De Faye (1898), who produced what he saw as a preliminary skirmish. He explored the relation between Christianity and Greek philosophy in the second century. Clement had been a man of transition and indeed the true creator of ecclesiastical theology. The time was not ripe to prepare a complete study of his thought. But an introduction would clarify his problems, which were of three kinds: literary, historic and dogmatic. The literary problem concerned the Stromateis: what did this disordered work achieve? The problem of history was to establish the relation of Clement and his ideas to other Christians at the time. The dogmatic question was to discover the extent of the influence of Greek phi losophy on Clement. The Stromateis were the most important and most obscure work to emerge from the church in the second and third centuries (45); they cannot represent the final stage of Clement's work and we must conclude that Clement never achieved his projected work on the Didascalus, which would have resembled the De Principiis of Origen (83).4 The Stromateis do not declare the great mysteries as Clement had intended (99). Yet he could neither avoid the questions concerning God and the logos, the uni verse, moral principles of morality, nor remain with the simple faith of the believers. He wanted a philosophy, which could stand alongside that of the Greeks (100). So the Stromateis are a first draft. Clement's verve carries him through the repetitions, digressions and parentheses (109). He hoped to write a more systematic work, but probably death prevented him from achieving his goal; he did not have time to revise and correct his work (l1 Of). Clement's writing is directed against Gnostics, Greek philosophers and those who refuse to move beyond a simple faith, the simpliciores (147). In philosophy, he remains eclectic because his own moral and religious faith governs his philosophical choice (157, 8). Philosophy never loses its lower place; it was a preparation for the gospel and remains subordinate to it (175). ret what philosophy here offers is less a set of opinions than a method of ratio 4 This claim though once common would now be rejected by most.</page><page sequence="3">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 369 nal argument, the true dialectic, which Clement takes from Plato and applies to his Christian faith (179). At the same time he knows the moral teaching of the philosophers and sees in them a preparation for the teaching of the gospel (182). Indeed, philosophy became more influential on his ideas than he was prepared to allow (183), for he presents a philosophical account of faith and shows how it is tied to the pursuit of knowledge. His idea of God, of the person of Christ and of the true gnostic, all show a respect for philos ophy as well as a dependence on scripture. Both the rationality and the mys ticism of philosophy influence Clement to produce a form of Christianity, which differs from that of Tertullian and Cyprian.5 Regrettably, in the history of the church, the way of Carthage and Rome took precedence over that of Alexandria. De Faye was wrong in looking for a system; he was right in identifying the importance of Clement's Platonic method, the true dialectic. Patrick. Clement as theologian These lectures were delivered in 1900 but not published until 1914. They set Clement's ideas in order. Taking his bearings from Clement's use of the bible, Patrick asked the questions concerning God, the person and work of Christ, ethics and the place of scripture. His account is remarkable for its coherent detail, which covers all that historical theology could wish. Clement's historical priority is affirmed. Clement is 'the first Christian teacher to find a place in his system of thought for all forms of truth' (33). Clement oscillates between philosophy and Christian theology (65). God 'knows existent things as his own volitions' which have been realised and are his work (74). He is absolute first principle and alone unbegotten (78). Yet he is not the cause of evils which result from human freedom (94f). God is a trinity and the incarnation is central (99); all this is presented to win over the educated Greek. Clement's theology is marked by the doctrine of the Word. 'He found in it the key to a right conception of God, of nature, of history, and of man' (137). Ethics begin from a high conception of humanity as a plant of heav enly origin (142) and follow the twofold ideal of faith and gnosis (150) which tries to rescue gnosis from 'the degradation which had fallen upon it' (186). Allegorical exegesis is justified by the divine origin of scripture (207). The 5 Tertullian cannot be classified in this way. He was profoundly influenced by classi cal thought. See J.C. Fredouille, Tertullien et la conversion de la culture antique (Paris, 1972).</page><page sequence="4">370 ERIC OSBORN four Gospels are acknowledged and Paul is the apostle par excellence. Patrick skilfully analyses Clement's main works in appendices to the book. Tollinton. Open, liberal theology. Variety of divine economy Simultaneously (1914) with Patrick, Tollinton published his popular two vol umes to claim Clement as a liberal rather than a radical theologian.6 His account is motivated by an uncritical sense of affinity between author and subject. Clement did not look at the darker realities of life and left 'a mem orable example of Christian serenity and high trust in goodness, knowledge and the power of love' (2/255). He had his limitations but 'he believed in truth and knowledge. He had no theological bitterness, he welcomed all good things as he found them' (2/262). All men are not like this, but Clement stands with 'Homer, Shakespeare, Erasmus, Goethe rather than with Aeschylus, Paul, Luther, Milton' (2/271). (This obscures the primacy of Paul in Clement's thought; Clement took his epistemology and soteriol ogy from Paul, the 'theios apostolos' i.e. appointed directly by God and not through the incarnate Christ). Tollinton senses common ground with his subject, and Clement is introduced into the English race and the English church, for 'in his distrust of extremes, in his love of peace, in his reverent and sober piety, he anticipates some of the best religious characteristics of our race' (2/283).7 Tollinton's assessment has been the source of much mirth over the years, yet it is probable that without this, he would not have finished the readable, limited synthesis of Clement's ideas, which he presents. Alexandria provided Clement with a setting where he could think and write creatively (22). He could unite a wide range of experience, join sound learning with true religion and follow a disinterested quest for truth (30). Clement's city and Clement's school are discussed in detail (47). His was the world of Galen whose scientific method was so advanced (178). He chose the literary form of the Stromateis, which was in vogue, for Aulus Gellius, Plutarch and Origen all wrote in this way (187). Opinions differ as to whether the Stromateis are the promised Didascalus. Tollinton cannot regard them as Clement's ultimate achievement but recognises the presence of his 6 'freisinnig', Harnack's term (see above note 2) can have both meanings: open-minded or liberal in Tollinton's narrow twentieth-century sense of antidogmatic. 7 Churchill, the most memorable Englishman of the century, would not qualify as English on Tollinton's definition.</page><page sequence="5">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 371 most profound thoughts within them (192). The Stromateis are unfinished probably because Clement grew more conscious as he proceeded that an exposition of complete and final truth 'lies beyond the achievement of any single human mind' (194). His appeal to the educated finds its chief support in Plato and its chief obstacle in persuading his readers to move on from their inherited culture and morals (218). Moral issues of the Paedagogus pre cede the intellectual issues of the Stromateis (242). Against the power of riches, sex, food and drink, Clement advocates simplicity and restraint. He writes at length of marriage, children and a Christian home, 'a home-life founded on religion' (283). Emancipation of women had gained some ground, and Clement brings Christian arguments in its favour (286). In the Paedagogus, Clement appears as a man of great versatility, described by Bigg as 'a most unusual type of cleric' (246). Clement is readily assimilated in all his values to the character of a gentleman (264). In his ideas the logos takes precedence because through the logos, truth is brought together (335). Yet this unifying concept is not his final word about God, who is beyond plurality and joined to the world by his logos. Here the problem of mediation between the one and the many provides a challenge beyond logical solution, 'but what is logically without solution is sometimes a commonplace of spiritual experience. If men know anything of God, they know that he is far and near at once' (338). In his account of the incarnation, Clement holds on to Paul,John and the Letter to the Hebrews, and stands between them and the great councils of the fourth century (2/2). He is definite on the fact of the incarnation, but indefinite concerning its mode and implications (2/8). His freedom is tied to an insistence that God had variousl appeared to mankind in his economy of salvation. His openness is valu able: he tries to bring together many different currents and accounts (2/28). Clement did not like controversy, yet Gnosticism was a challenge which he could not ignore (2/35). Despite his criticisms, he qualifies his judgement and can sometimes praise the Gnostic position (2/48). Proof from scripture is final: 'he who believes in the divine scripture and is possessed of sure judgement, receives as incontrovertible demonstration the voice of God who bestowed the scriptures' (2/194). Clement applies the term 'prophetic scrip tures' to the whole of the Old Testament, for Moses, David and Solomon are classified as prophets; they include hints and anticipation of the Christian dispensation (2/198). Clement most frequently quotes from the Gospels the teaching and words of the Lord (2/202). The use of allegory enabled him to join scripture together in harmony and to universalise what belonged to a particular time and place.</page><page sequence="6">372 ERIC OSBORN Tollinton, in his singleness of mind, did not see Clement's problems, but he popularised Clement's theology and linked it with the divine economy.8 Mondisert. Supremacy of scripture and divine economy In contrast, Mondesert produced, in war-time France, a small and pene trating book. He later added to our knowledge of Clement through texts and translations in Sources Chretiennes, which series was his enterprise and achievement. Later still, A. Le Boulluec extended and confirmed this con tribution as the chief advance in the studies on Clement for the century. Through these editions the argument of Clement, as a thinker, stands out with fresh clarity; it is from his argument that Clement is understood. Mondesert rightly takes scripture as the basis of Clement's thought. Clement's esoterism has no other secret than the sublime scriptural myster ies, which he pursues through prayerful meditation and imparts with the help of Platonic dialectic (61). He makes the language of the bible his own (71). Scripture possesses supreme authority and mysterious form (81): 'a wis dom which is a knowledge of things divine and human, a sure intelligence which is firm and indestructible, which holds together all things present, past and future; this wisdom the lord has taught us by his presence and his prophets' (str 6.7.54f). This revelation has been lived out in history (87). Found in the mysterious forms of enigma, allegory, parable and symbol (88), it brings the reader into contact with God and his logos (95), always requir ing mental effort and philosophical awareness (112). Scripture interprets scripture, with impartiality and with respect for the mass of inherited expo sition (127-9). A linear sytem is never a possibility. 'S'il y a une terminologie compliqu6e et anarchique, c'est bien celle qui concerne les divers sens possibles de l'Ecriture'.9 Mondesert even removes one simplification by showing the slen der debt which Clement owes to Philo: 'au fond, il lui doit assez peu'; for Clement presents 'un usage beaucoup plus large et beaucoup plus varie, qui temoigne une intelligence de la Bible beaucoup plus penetrante'.'0 Clement's theology begins from the economy ('l'histoire religieuse de l'humanite') which centres in the incarnation (188): 'la lutte morale, les 8 Much was written in the next three decades on the literary problems in Clement. The controversy was summed up by M?hat (1966). 9 Mond?sert, Cl?ment, 153. 10 Ibid., 183.</page><page sequence="7">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 373 recherches religieuses, les 'enigmes de la vie et de la destine'e humaines trou vent leur reponse dans la re'demption, dans l'illumination, la perfection, le salut, et finalement l'apocatastase' (190). Humanity is like a single human being. &amp;vOpeono6TI; is a frequent word and dominant concept (192). Recip rocal love of God for humanity brings unity to the economy, which the kerygma proclaims (196-8; paed 1.3.7-9). The cosmos is brought into har mony by the one divine logos (prot 1.6). 'Toutes ces diverses thieses, qui paraissent, a priemiere vue, dans son oeuvre, eparses, fortuites et sans lien entre elles, supposent au contraire, la ferme persistance et la presence latente d'une vaste conception d'ensemble de l'oeuvre unique de creation et de salut du Dieu unique' (207). This vast conception is that of the divine economy. Clement is cited: 'the economy inaugurated by the saviour has produced a kind of universal movement and change' (213; str 6.6.47.1). From this has come the newness of the gospel and salvation, a newness, which Clement celebrates as no other writer, does (217; prot 1 1.1 14); consequently his apolo getic is marked by optimism (236). Mond'esert sums up the achievement of Clement as a blend of intellec tual audacity and reserve, from an intellectual who is ardently devout, a Platonist and biblical theologian who unites the cultures of Jerusalem and Athens (267).11 More forcefully than most, he insists on rich coherence rather than simple system. Vdlker. Evangelical piet_ and perfection Clement, Volker argues, has taken elements from many contexts and inserted them into a new Christian structure. The evangelical motif acts like a magnet on scattered particles to give them a new order. Volker begins from Clement's Alexandrian situation, problems with simpliciores who want no philosophy and with philosophers who denigrate Christian faith. The summit of his writing is his description of the ideal Christian, the true sage, who embodies the gospel. Regrettably, Clement lacks a fixed terminology (13) and symbolism points to hidden meanings (16). His bible is the source of revelation and the best example of symbolic writing (18). 11 T.

The dis pute over whether the Stromateis are the promised Didascalus is, says Volker, a mistake. His interpreters have wanted to find in Clement an exact system such as they might expect from a modern author (33).12 Volker aims to pre sent clearly Clement's ideal of a Christian life. In spite of all ambiguities, contradictions and obscurities, Clement has a clear, well-defined under standing of Christian piety (73). Volker argues for rich coherence rather than linear system. The fight against sin takes the first step towards perfection. Sin is offence against God, and Clement's account of God begins from his goodness and love. God is a God of philanthropia. Negative theology is balanced by the pos itive theology of love; the goodness of God is consistent with his justice (84). The economy of salvation takes many forms (85), and spreads from the indi vidual through history and to all creation (90). Clement's negative theology comes from Philo and has little influence on his Christian piety (95). The divine word educates man throughout the history of salvation (101-104), which is governed by a theology of the cross. Clement develops the idea of 'image and likeness' in his own way, making 'image' the conscience which is always present and 'likeness' that which is developed. The image is never separable from the believer (114). To the likeness of God is tied freedom of will, so that God and man work together for the good life (115); synergy provides the structure of the moral life (123). The slow ascent to perfection begins with faith (220),1' whence the moral life proceeds (254). Clement brings together a mass of Stoic terms and gives them a new focus (264). The more one reads Clement, the more one is amazed by the unity of his thought. From beginning to end, he is concerned with direction by God's spirit and a closer following of Christ (300). Knowledge is identified with wisdom (309, 382). Vision or theo6ria is added as another synonym (316). The sage, the gndstikos, is the man in Christ (327) who learns and from scripture and tradition (354). Knowledge is gained by the mind (365) and the movement from faith to knowledge eludes transpo sition into any modern vocabulary (379). The objects of knowledge are the noeta, the 'forms' of Plato and the 'powers' of the bible, which have already 12 V?lker clearly had not met any philosophers, who nursed 'strong dislike?amount ing almost to hatred in the case of Wittgenstein?of all overarching theories and singu lar schemes of explanation'.

Skinner, The return of Grand Theory to the Human Sciences (Cambridge, 1985), 12. 13 Clement's account of faith differs from that of Philo (250).</page><page sequence="9">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 375 been joined in Philo. Christ and his promises comprise this divine realm of intellectual objects, which are the sum of theology (392). To know them is to become isaggelos, present with the Lord who sees all things in an unbro ken vision (403), which is supported by constant prayer. How far it is proper to call Clement a 'mystic' depends on current definition (427). Clement's vision, in its unity and transcendence, remains the Johannine personal vision of divine glory. The goal of assimilation to God is deification (434), where Clement combines yearning for God, life, immortality and joy (442). Perfection joins knowledge and works (44). This blending of word, thought and deed is again Stoic, but transformed by Clement (455), for all is of grace (458). Courage (andreia) colours every part of Clement's good life (473). His Stoic concepts are infused with the blood of agape (479). This he has drawn from the Johannine Gospel and Epistle (481) to achieve a synthesis, which Nygren foolishly failed to see (484). Love joins all the virtues (kindness, for getfulness of evil, mercy, fulfilling all the law) (491). As in the Sermon on the Mount, 1 Cor. 13 and John, love is the imitation of God through the imitation of Christ (496). The unchanging disposition of love accepts and reshapes the Stoic virtues in the portrait of the true gnostic (507). Joy, as in Stoic ethics, is rounded off by a rest in God (519). Divergences from Stoic ethics may be noted in forgetfulness of wrong and the continuing newness of Christian life. The imitation of angelic glory is part of a universal move ment towards God and contrasts with Stoic individualism. Apatheia is the removal of all epithumia, and is linked to the eucharist, to the cross and to the wonder of God in Christ. By the imitation of God in Christ, each Christian becomes part of the history of salvation and is made divine and equal to an angel (604). Clement's coherence is shaped by the gospel. The kerygma is applied to the whole bible and philosophy plays a subordinate role. Osborn. Coherence of Clement My first book on Clement, written from a background of analytic philoso phy, aimed to identify the questions for which Clement sought answers. His reluctance to propound a system was always a virtue, for 'the philosopher unless he be a very bad philosopher-does not set out to construct a sys tem, what he is trying to do is to solve problems."4 Clement asked first, 14 John Passmore, 'The idea of a history of philosophy', HThS 5(1965), 27.</page><page sequence="10">376 ERIC OSBORN 'What is God like?' and 'What is the good life?' and 'How is truth known?' Clement's answers followed the pattern of Plato's Parrnenides (one and one many). God was for Clement the simple transcendent One and the world was a complex unity, which depended on him through his logos. God the father was a simple unity (one and nothing but one). God the son was a complex unity (one and many). The same pattern was found in ethics where the unique goodness of God was the source of the manifold goodness of men. In logic, the rule of faith, a simple body of basic beliefs, flowed into the manifold unity of truth, which included all human knowledge. Clement stood up to this analysis; the richness of his grasp of God was never impaired by his logic. His many sources pointed to a mind of critical subtlety, which argued for a deeper unity than most interpreters had seen. Dualism was never an answer to the intimate nearness and transcendent wonder of God. Philosophy showed the way in which Clement thought and what he did with the mass of stuff he integrated. Previous writers had doubted or denied Clement's synthesis of his varie gated sources. Volker had argued that his account of Christian faith and perfection fitted together but his philosophy did not. The conclusion that Clement achieved coherence between his philosophical, literary and biblical sources was a forward step.'5 Sadly, some readers wanted to believe in sys tems and wrongly identified Clement's philosophising with a linear system. Mehat. Literagy structure From Mehat came thorough literary investigation of Clement's Stromateis. He began by reviewing earlier theories. De Faye saw Clement as synthetic rather than analytic and the Stromateis as a parenthesis between the second work of the trilogy and the unwritten third work. Bousset produced an analysis based on supposed sources of Clement, which were lecture notes. Munck found in the Stromateis a miscellany or Buntschreiberei. Clement, he claimed, intended, but did not complete, two trilogies: firstly, the Protrepticus and the Paedagogus and a work for simple believers, and secondly, Stromateis One to Three and Four to Seven and a 'Physiology'. Lazzati argued that the Stromateis were lecture notes, which Clement took down but did not 15 Lilla was able to pursue a fuller exploration of contemporary sources and Wyrwa was to show that beyond these sources Plato himself was part of Clement's rich coherence.</page><page sequence="11">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 377 revise. Mehat rejected these accounts and insisted that the work is not hap hazard but written according to a clear plan which is appropriate to Clement's position as a teacher in Alexandria. It is driven by a passion to impart the tradition or gospel. The basic unit of the Stromateis is the 'small chapter', which is arranged according to a total plan. Clement col lects his little chapters and edits them into an observable sequence. They are directed to different audiences: the unlearned pagan, the unlearned Christian, educated people, philosophers, and finallyJews and heretics. The diversity of Clement's audience explains the diversity of the Stromateis (293). The greater part of this audience consists of educated people, who are not philosophers but have some acquaintance with philosophy (327). The conclusions of Mehat's vast work may be set out. The Stromateis may be classed with the miscellanies written by Aulus Gellius and Athenaeus, but have a different purpose. They follow an ordered plan and aim to prove the truth of their doctrine. They are better understood by the second descrip tion in their title as 'notes'. The joining of notes into a large philosophical work may also be seen in Plotinus and Sextus Empiricus. Notes are domi nated by a current, which flows through them. The reader is constantly brought back to the same points so that he may see them with increasing clarity. We know that Clement has direct access to the bible and to Philo; his knowledge of other works may come from contemporary forilegia. The Stromateis are a work of instruction, and have their faults, errors and pas sions. Clement shows a sense of resignation for, 'knowledge is not in all', but his dominant motif is one of hope as he pushes on. Mehat describes his thought as a 'grande metaphysique de la charite' (537).16 Bernard, Clement as apologist In contrast to Mehat, the distinction of Bernard's work began from the actu ality of Clement for a theologian working in Eastern Europe. Others were to write rubbish about the irrelevance of early Christian thought to con temporary apologetic, because they imagined that stuff could be cleanly lifted from one context to another, although history of ideas has never worked in that way. Bernard stayed in Eastern Germany by choice and his 16 He applauds the verdict of Tollinton that Clement is a liberal, whose Stromateis pre sent a fine example of 'open theology'; both fail to grasp Clement's theological intentions as set out by Mond?sert.</page><page sequence="12">378 ERIC OSBORN academic life was given to apologetic in the widest sense. He found the sec ond century to be a major source.'7 Clement's apologetic went behind par ticular objections to basic problems, for in his critique of polytheism, he explored both origins and consequences and went on to argue from Greek sources that one personal God exists. Zeus is dead and the light of the divine word has come to all. Philosophy was needed before the coming of Christ and its usefulness (within limits) remains. For philosophy, like every thing else, was perfected in Christ according to the principle: the perfection of Greek paideta through the logos paidagogos, who became man, and that man might become God. As Clement's interpreters see persistently, the argument against Gnosticism begins from the divine plan/economy (169), which gov erns the creation and redemption of humanity. Dualism is wrong not just because it goes against scripture and denies one God, but because it denies the worth of physical creation and the integrity of a human person (169). As an apologist, Clement both related the truth of the gospel to the Greek world and took over elements of Greek culture, which the gospel could use. He cannot be understood from philological Quellnforschung. His optimism has deep roots in the openness of humanity to God, analogia entis, potentia oboedentialis and desiderium naturale for God. His apologetic is concerned to win over rather than to rebut opponents (204). Lilla. Philosophical sources Lila shows abundantly how the Middle Platonist world, to which Clement belonged, contributed many elements to Christian thought. Against V6lker, he insists that Clement's ethics come from philosophy. The two stages, in which passion is first moderated and then removed, reflect an agreement between Clement, Philo and Neo-Platonism (104). Philo, Middle Platonism and Neo-Platonism in their syncretism of Platonic, Stoic and Aristotelian elements influence Clement's ethics. Clement's highest ideal goes beyond that of his contemporaries: assimilation to God is achieved through the activity of the divine logos (1 13). In his epistemology, Clement is again dependent on philosophy. Faith is defined in three ways: it is the means by which first principles of demon stration are grasped, the conviction which comes at the end as well as the 17 Bernard translated my The beginning of Christian philosophy (Cambridge, 1981) and Peter Brown's Augustine of Hippo into German because he saw their relevance to the apolo getic situation in East Germany.</page><page sequence="13">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 379 beginning of a scientific demonstration, and the way in which simple believ ers receive the truth of scripture. Clement's ideal of gnosis begins from the symbolic nature of scripture and a secret tradition. The logos is the teacher of knowledge and calls to a life of contemplation within the intelligible world. Preparatory disciplines in philosophy prepare for knowledge and the allegory of the entrance of the high priest into the holy of holies points to the ascent of the gnostic soul and its deification (143). Vision is the highest knowledge. Here there are clear roots in Philo, Phaedo, Symposium, Phaedrus, Republic. Alcinous (did. 153.18-20) speaks in much the same way as does Clement (7.7.46.4) and Maximus of Tyre (Or. 10.56a). Plotinus and Philo speak in a similar way. Clement does not merely wish to follow the language of pagan philoso phers in order to convert them. 'He wanted to transform his religious faith into a monumental philosophical system, to which he allotted the task of reflecting the absolute truth'. So he 'considered the best doctrines of Greek philosophy as practically one and the same thing with the highest aspect of Christianity since they, according to him, had been originated by the divine logos' (232). Lilla is a gifted doxographer who pays little attention to the way Clement uses the concepts he borrows.'8 His linear philological account and its system are clear examples of this inadequate approach. Brontesi. The economy of salvation Remarkably, another Italian scholar produced, almost simultaneously with Lilla, the longest (773 pages) book on Clement, which indicated how Clement used his many sources in rich coherence. The economy of salva tion shapes Clement's thought: 'la salvezza e tutto' (237). The one creator God saves over many times and places, and sends his son as universal sav iour. A similar unity marks the assimilation of the believer because faith and knowledge are indivisible: 'imitare Dio significa dunque un#icare la propria realta molteplice attorno al logos, facendo prevalere in se stessi l'attivita lo gica... l'attivita logica e salvifica perche e incontro con il Logos salvatore' (601). 18 Strangely, Lilla claims that Clement was connected direcdy through Pantaenus with Gnostic ideas. 'In fact Christian Gnosticism must be regarded as the source of the Christian element which enabled Clement to give a satisfactory solution to these Neo platonic problems' (234).</page><page sequence="14">380 ERIC OSBORN Clement offers a vast wealth of topics for research (una vastita feconda) and a correct perspective is necessary.'9 Brontesi performs a great service by establishing the centrality of the kerygma of salvation apart from which the writings of Clement would not have come into existence.20 Soteriology points to anthropology, which is central in Clement. There is anthropocen trism for several reasons: anthropocentric Stoic philosophy dominates the second century2' and Clement's Greek disposition sees man as the measure of all things. His comprehensive soteriology breaks the limits of humanity in a free encounter between man and God. 'Even when salvation is seen as God's gift, Clement's attention is fixed on human attitudes and reactions' (611). Yet salvation brings coherence to Clement's account of knowledge, christology, ecclesiology as well as to the relations of man to the cosmos, to God and other humans.22 For salvation is the passion of God as it is of humans, especially Clement (61 1).23 Wyrwa. Back to Plato This book challenges the short-cut, which identified Clement's account with that of Middle Platonism. Wyrwa offers an argued case to the contrary. Clement depends on Plato himself, and while he is aware of later inter preters, his use of Plato is distinctive. For all his contact with Middle Platonic tradition, Clement makes his own way. He follows no Platonic pre decessor with any consistency and is aware of interpreters who do not stand in the Platonic tradition. His common ground with Middle Platonic nega tive theology is clear, but on many points he stands in direct contradiction. He argues that Plato himself gave to the barbarian philosophy the higher 19 Which Lilla did not have. Clement used philosophy against Gnosticism as did Plotinus, but knew nothing of Neoplatonism. 20 The purpose of his book is 'individuare il motivo profondo (= soteriologico), tolto il quale il Corpus clementino non sarebbe'. 610. 21 Brontesi favours the perspective of Pohlenz. 22 An account of Clement's theology might follow, says Brontesi (611), the model of A. Orbe. Antropolog?a de San Ireneo (Madrid, 1969). The excellence of Orbe's book and that of Brontesi would be further enhanced if they were halved in size. 23 In 1973 R. Mordey published a useful account of Clement's epistemology, Con naissance religieuse et herm?neutique chez Cl?ment d'Alexandrie (Leiden, 1973). In 1977 a valuable study of Clement's philosophical method appeared: Apostolopoulou, G. Die Dialektik bd Klemens von Alexandria: Ein Bdtrag zur Geschichte der philosophischen Methoden (Frankfurt am Main, 1977).</page><page sequence="15">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 381 authority; he denies that matter is a first principle and thereby abandons the 'three principles doctrine'. He denies the eternity of the world and assumes a literal interpretation of the creation story in the Timaeus. His eschatological interpretation of assimilation to God and his claim that Plato recommended apatheia, are both inconsistent with Middle Platonism. His high valuation of faith and grace can find no place among pagan Platonists and such direct claims as that Christ is the difficult sacrifice necessary for knowledge are all in contradiction to any Platonic tradition. His special con cern is to bring Plato into agreement with orthodox Christianity and he turns to the text of Plato for his justification. Doxographical lists can obscure the fact that Clement is saying something new and that the centre of his theology is linked to the ideas of Plato himself. The two central themes of Clement's theology are the revelation of the transcendent God and the future perfection of creation at the eschaton (320). The second point is reached from a variety of claims. The world remains God's creation and his grace is extended to bring redemption and perfection; God's paideia culmi nates in the revelation of Christ. 'Christ is the redeemer and teacher who forgives sins and who reveals spiritual truth' (321). While the believer may turn to inner truth, he never despises the body which is God's creation; for it may used for spiritual progress towards God. The ascent of the knower anticipates the eschaton, and after death he receives, purified by fire, a refined body, and goes on to higher places. Spiritual growth is possible to the end of time, when those who are complete will find perfect sonship and eternal rest in the vision of God (322). Wyrwa usefully identifies the Platonic material, its transmission, Clem ent's interpretation, its function within the context of Clement's ideas, and finally the total relation of Clement to Plato (2). In the dispute over whe ther Clement used Plato himself or merely collections of Platonic material, a decision in favour of Plato's original text is made. Only one fifth of Clement's citations from Plato are to be found in the florilegium of Johannes Stobaeus (5)! Van den Hoek. Clement and Philo The relation of Philo and Clement has long been a puzzle. Why did Clement use (without acknowledgement) so much of a writer who knew nothing of those things with which Clement was most concerned? On this question we have moved a long way in the last century. First, Clement has been included in a magisterial work concerning the place of Philo in early</page><page sequence="16">382 ERIC OSBORN Christian thought.24 Clement's many citations are not misleading but dis play both an affinity and a drastic change between the two writers. Secondly, a careful study classifies and examines at length Clement's citations of Philo.25 Four major sequences are examined: Hagar and Sarah (23-47), the story of Moses (49-68), the law and the virtues (69-115), temple vestments and the high priest (116-147). Four short sequences show equal if not greater penetration (148-176).26 The conclusion is well justified: 'Philo however was his (Clement's) master in the use and interpretation of the Pentateuch, skills that other traditions did not provide. In addition, Philo's vision that made it possible to link philosophical concepts with the biblical message was of great influence; this vision itself must be considered as "a step of monumental significance in the history of thought, a step with greater consequences for the development of philosophy and religion than its author could possibly have foreseen".27 On this track Philo found a fol lower in Clement; the latter hungrily swallowed Philo's words and eagerly absorbed his thoughts; he used Philo's inventions and misused them to pro vide his own. Many of the twisting threads of Clement's theological think ing are taken from Philo but they are woven into a very different tapestry' (229f). Yet the relation between Clement and Philo has been drastically reopened in a recent article. The golden thread, which runs through Clement, is Christ as the power and wisdom of God. The divine plan moves to God's final wisdom and power in the son, the divine love measures equally the wisdom and power of Father and Son, and the new creation springs from faith in Christ as wisdom and from his salvation as power.28 24 D.T. Runia, Philo in early Christian literature (Assen, 1993). 25 A. van den Hoek, Clement of Alexandria and his use ofPhilo in the Stromateis (Brill, 1988). 26 'The first and the last sequence deal with the problem of the knowledge of God and with the anthropomorphic way of speaking about God found in the Bible. The second sequence describes the ascent of the Gnostic soul on its way to contemplation . . . The third sequence deals with the Gnostic soul in its relationship to God' (148). 27 Cited from D. Runia, Philo of Alexandria and the Timaeus of Plato (Leiden, 1986), 544. 28 See David T. Runia 'Clement of Alexandria and the Philonic doctrine of the divine powers', Vig Chr 58,3,2004, 256-276. Clement's thought comes together in the Pauline concept of the power and wisdom of God. The divine powers of Philo are joined together in Christ and united with the father in one God (Ibid., 261, 265) 'God is knowable, but only through his power, which Clement does not connect with divine forces in the cos mos, but with the knowledge that comes through the Son' (Ibid., 267). For Philo the divine power is mediated through the logos who 'measures' it so that humanity is not destroyed by its excess but aided by its fine tuning (opif23). 'Clement has combined fea</page><page sequence="17">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 383 Here Philo illuminates Clement, especially when Clement deviates from him. Ri'zerio. Physiologv as ultimate mystery Rizzerio has drawn attention to the centre of Clement's thought in his truly gnostic physiology (i xp OV-rt YV@oTci puatokoyia) where dialectic joins the God of philosophers with the God of the bible and unites philosophy with the divine logos.29 Wisdom is gained only by dialectic, purification and a harmony of soul with the cosmos.A0 Clement will not separate ascetic prac tice and dialectic. Physiology had begun as knowledge of the natural world but became the interpretation of phenomena as signs of transcendent real ity. Myth and reality (|iToq, q.patq) reflected the distinction between appear ance and reality. Plutarch and others found cosmology in myths and religious rites; sacred symbols pointed to the physiology of the cosmos. Clement claims authority and precision when he speaks of the truly gnostic physiology which depends on the divine logos.3' His true dialectic finds the form beyond particulars and goes on to the ultimate form. Metaphor and allegory lead to dialectic, since the voira are traces of God in the world. True gnosis and physiology32 culminate in vision (?ioxceia) of the first prin ciple where all is seen through the divine logos. For the final step of via negativa is submersion in the magnitude of Christ which leads to holiness. Scripture is the path to final mystery and simplicity.33 Schneider. Theology as Christian Philosophy For Schneider, Christian philosophy is Clement's interpretation of the bible. Plato gives rational structure; the bible gives flesh and blood to his concepts. For Clement the economy is the criterion by which other philosophy is tested and a gathering point for parts of pagan philosophy. On the way to Christ, philosophy was given as a covenant to the Greeks (101) and the new tures of Philonic thought?the twin powers of goodness and justice, the role of the Logos as measurer?into a new theology centred on divine love shared by Father and Son.' 29 Rizzerio, 291. 30 Ibid., 295. 31 Rizzerio, Ibid., 299. 32 Rizzerio, Ibid., 302. 33 Rizzerio, Ibid., 312.</page><page sequence="18">384 ERIC OSBORN covenant fulfils philosophy as it does the bible (111), bringing all to the unity of faith (str 6.1 06f; 113). The gospel unites Jew and Greek in one covenant under God, even reaching back to those who lived before the coming of Christ through the preaching of Christ in Hades (113). In scripture the one covenant is found in many forms (123). Allegory lifts interpretation to a higher level and symbolism brings a multiplication of meanings. The mysteries of scripture are hidden and must be protected by concealment (130). Here Clement draws on Plato and sees philosophy as a protection as well as a clarification for scriptural truth. The Stromateis engage the reader in dialogue as Plato had done (139). In scripture, concealment is found obviously in the law, less in the prophets and less again in John the Baptist, who prepares the way for direct revelation in Christ. The divine economy makes sense of the bible (152). The final section of Clement's thought concerns the perfection of the Christian (225). In contrast to Gnosticism. Clement affirms both humanity and creation. The optimism of Heilsgeschichte corrects any negative overtones which might be detected in Plato. Dualism has no place. Bible and philos ophy point to one world in which the true gnostic rises to perfection (231). Osborn. The ker}gma of one God, his economy and salvation through faith My own recent book, which must be seen as a post-script to the hundred years, elucidates the problems, which Clement faced. Kerygma and economy. A rational plan of divine movement is declared in scripture and fulfilled in Christ. Clement asks: Can this plan offer coherent answers to questions about God, freedom and immortality? How do we move from narrative and oracle to philosophy and morals? One God. Scripture proclaimed one God. How can Father and Son be one God? How can the logos both be God and be with God? Clement's expo sition ofJohn's answer to this question has not been surpassed: the word is within (Jn 1:18) and beside God (Jn 1:1). Faith and salvation. Paul offered salvation by faith. How can faith be the one way to truth and what is the salvation, which redeems and preserves mankind? How can knowledge be subordinate to faith? Clement's response to the three problems is governed by three major concepts: divine plan/economy, reciprocity, and salvation by faith. Every thing, he says, is ordered by 'the goodness of the only, one, true, almigh_y God, from age to age saving by the son' (7.2.12). Faith is the one universal salvation of man kind (paed 1.6.30).</page><page sequence="19">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 385 1. The rational divine plan is discerned by dialectic. The ever-coherent economy culminates in Christ and his universal offer of salvation through faith. Moses gave the law, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. In the same plan, philosophy was given to the Greeks to prepare them for Christ and to make scripture clear to all. Irenaeus had shown how the kerygma could be proved from scripture and had claimed that there was nothing incongruent in the divine economy (haer 3.16.7). Clement makes the same claim (str 7.15.91), Marcion plainly showed that there was great inconsistency and in modern times, Harnack has claimed that there is too much in the Old Testament that conflicts with the New for the former to retain canonical status for Christians. Clement cracked this problem with Paul's drastic 'letter/spirit' hermeneutic and allegorical interpretation. Only incarnation and cross should be taken literally; everything else, as Paul had claimed, should be interpreted by reference to them. From the divine economy came the true dialectic whereby scripture presented the world of forms to be investigated with all the tools of logic under the criterion of the cross. Only thus did God's saving plan (as revealed in scripture) present a coherent account of divine activity. The movement of the divine plan, which culminates in Christ, resembles the forms of Plato, which consummate in the form of the good. Just as dialectic is used to find how forms lead to higher forms, so it shows how the divine economies discerned in scripture become one econ omy governed by God in Christ. To lift verses of scripture out of this plan of salvation destroys their context and meaning. True dialectic and true phi losophy must work together. 2. One God 'saving by the Son'. One God was the starting point of the kerygma. Paul had found it possible to believe in one God, if and only if, Christ were also God. He became a monotheist, when he became a Christian. For John, one God meant reciprocity of Father and Son. To many this crucial move was and is mysterious: do not Christians have two Gods?34 FollowingJohn, Clement claims that the one God is marked by rec iprocal love. Always, the Word was with God and was God (Jn 1:1). No one comes to the Father but by the Son (Jn 14:6) and no one comes to the Son unless the Father draws him (Jn 6:44). Reciprocity works on three lev els: between Father and Son, between God and every human person, between human and human (QD.S.37). The mystery of divine love between Father and Son makes God know able and accessible to humans in love. Clement shows how the Platonic 34 See Origen, Dialogue with Heraclides, 120-30.</page><page sequence="20">386 ERIC OSBORN metaphysics of mind which is both a simple transcendent unity and a uni verse of forms, makes sense of reality when defined in terms of the Christian God, Father and Son. The final step in the ladder of being is not a step but a beam-balance (zygon, trutani) (paed 1.8.71.3). Reality is ruled by reciprocal love, which flows in three ellipses from Father and Son, to God and humans, then to humans and humans. The transcendent Father embraces the world of forms or powers and the universal Son brings all into unity. So the intellectual universe confirms the salvation, which God in Christ imparts. 3. 'Salvation by faith'. Faith like a grain of mustard seed 'bites beneficially into the soul so that it grows in it magnificently until the reasons concern ing the highest realities rest upon it' (5.1.3.1). Faith, initially simple, includes knowledge of God, which grows in intimacy and content. Faith is forever moving on, searching like Plato for the best reason (beltistos logos). Clement's ideas are united by the salvation of humankind, which is God's eternal purpose, the restoration of his children to the vision face to face. While affirming the priority of kerygma and scripture, I take seriously the philosophical issues with which Clement engaged. Whether Clement shows how philosophy and theology can be brought together today is a complex question. However, the exploration of Clement's synthesis remains valuable for any who wish to relate these two spheres of human thought.35 Conclusion My restriction to monographs on Clement has merely noted the work of Alain Le Boulluec whose contribution to understanding of Clement has not been surpassed. His editions (with commentary) of Books 7 and 5 of the Stromateis (Sources Chretiennes 278, 428, 463) have enriched appreciation of Clement's meaning immeasurably. Ten points may be made in review of our highly diverse writers of the last hundred years and their recurrent attention to both scripture (as ordered by divine economy), and philosophy (as method and accumulated wisdom). 35 For this reason, I commend the points where Clement's thought illuminates philos ophy and theology today. For example, Clement's epistemology of faith has clear affinity with Swinburne's internalist account of epistemic justification. R. Swinburne, Epistemic Justification (Oxford, 2001).</page><page sequence="21">ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF BOOKS ON CLEMENT 387 1. Questions raised by one author have been explored or answered by others. Lilla and Wyrwa have answered Volker's rejection of philosophy in different ways. It is most encouraging that after a lapse of thirty years (1914-44) when literary questions dominated, the challenge of Clement's ideas returned to prominence. 2. The relation of bible and philosophy in Clement remains an issue, chiefly through the foolish survival of Ritschl's rejection of Greek philosophy (as interpreted in the nineteenth century), accepted without serious query by Barth. The opposite view (that Clement is a biblical theologian, an exegete and a philosopher) has been commonly accepted. 3. The relation of philosophy to doxography is important. Lilla sees little difficulty in the simple identification of fragments of philosophy in Clement. Generally, however, the question as to what Clement does with each fragment has rightly superseded naive Quellenforschung. 4. Recent interpreters have affirmed the centrality of the kerygma in Clement's thought. Just as Irenaeus was dominated by the fourfold kerygma of divine intellect, economy, recapitulation and participation so Clement has no other message. 5. The complexity of Clement as ofJustin, Irenaeus and Tertullian (not the complexity of their sources) is the most striking quality to emerge. Awarding or denying prizes to these writers is unwise; they will always surprise. Analysis of problems rather than selection according to later pri orities has taken over. The sheer length of arguments (some in Irenaeus have twenty moves) calls for skills, which some patristic scholars do not have (gqueiq adyEw,Erpii0roq eiumo). Neglect of argument and analysis led to the common but idiot classification of Tertullian as a fideist. As propaedeutic, geometry and logic might well be supplemented by har mony and counterpoint if the reader is to find the rich coherence of these writers. 6. Clement's joining of prayer with reason, of piety with argument, of Paul, John with Plato, produced a defining tradition which is commonly noticed first in Augustine's Confessions. 7. Clement and Philo continue to illuminate one another through their difference as much as through their similarity; their great divergence is that of Pauline-Johannine Christianity from Judaism. Runia showed that Clement's debt goes beyond verbal parallels to central concepts. 8. The exploration of Clement's complexity and our contemporary re jection of systems, make the identification of the Stromateis with the proposed Didascalus a simple matter. Given Clement's allusive method of</page><page sequence="22">388 ERIC OSBORN teaching, miscellanies are the appropriate way of maintaining the Platonic tradition of oblique instruction. 9. Clement's dependence on Paul andJohn enables him to illuminate both writers, through his exposition of the Johannine God and logos or of the Pauline predominance of Christ and him crucified. 10. Finally, the place of incarnation and christology at the centre of Christian theology is established by Clement. The biblical claims in this area represent the central difficulty today for Christianity in a secular world; this brings special interest to Clement who first developed the Johannine claims on a grand scale.36 P.O.
