<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some of the most influential modern British writers sought to evoke numinous states of consciousness in their readers. Using a phenomeno- logical approach to the reading experiencey this essay argues that D. H. Lawrence structures his novel The Rainbow as a religious initiation rite for revitalizing and reintegrating the reader's consciousness. The Religious Initiation of the Reader in D. H. Lawrence s The Rainbow CHARLES M. BURACK Many ested British in radical modernist transformations writers were of consciousness. deeply inter- ested in radical transformations of consciousness. Some of their most powerful artistry went into crafting representations of epiphanies, visions, sacred encounters, and other numinous moments when consciousness is expanded, intensified, integrated or transfigured. While these representations have been studied for their symbolic meanings, what has often been overlooked is their impact on the reader's consciousness. Such textual effects are cru- cial because some of the most influential modernists understood their literary aims in visionary terms. Indeed, some modernist poets and novelists even hoped that their representations of numinous experiences would evoke analogous states of mind in the reader. One way to investi- gate the transformative effects of these representations is to use a phenomenological approach to the reading experi- ence. Wolfgang Iser has developed an approach that focuses on how textual structures invite and channel "the implied reader's" cognitive and emotive responses (Iser 34). His phenomenological method assumes that the text verbally prestructures possible responses and that the reader actual- izes one or more of those potentials through an act of con- struction. Textual meaning is "no longer an object to be defined, but is an effect to be experienced" (10). Mosaic 33/3 0027- 1276-00/1 650 18$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">166 Mosaic 33/3 (September 2000) One of the British modernists most intent on producing fundamental transformations of consciousness in his readers was D. H. Lawrence. Indeed, Lawrence had an explicitly religious understanding of the artist. On February 24, 1913, a month before he began composing what would become The Rainbow ( 1915), he wrote about the numinous nature of his own creativity: "I always feel as if I stood for the fire of Almighty God to go through me - and it's a rather awful feeling. One has to be so terribly religious, to be an artist" (Letter 550 in Letters , vol. 1, 519). Like many of the Romantic poets, he experienced creative inspiration as a holy encounter. Readily generalizing from his own experience, Lawrence believed that "[a]t the maximum of our imagination, we are religious" and that "[a]n artist can only create what he really religiously feels is truth, religious truth really felt, in the blood and the bones" ( Phoenix 559, 562). In The Rainbow , Lawrence s religious sensibilities are powerfully evident. Less apparent is how he seeks to provoke numinous experiences in his readers. Critics have examined the nature of Lawrence's religious ideas and symbols, but have skirted the question of how the intensely evocative Rainbow functions as religious art. I will argue that The Rainbow can be considered "hierophantic art" in that it seeks to evoke sacred experiences in the reader. By "sacred experi- ences" I mean subjective experiences of divinity in or beyond the world. The structure and character of The Rainbow's narrative textures suggest that Lawrence is trying to play the role of a hierophant: he is acting like the conductor of a religious initiation rite who leads novitiates through a series of transformative experiences designed to culminate in the aware- ness of or union with the divine. In a typical initiation rite, the hierophant attempts to break down and purge the novitiate's ordinary, habitual mode of consciousness and to evoke a new, sacred mode. My phenomenologi- cally oriented analysis of The Rainbow shows that the novel possesses an initiatory rhythm of destruction (mortification, purification, purgation) and sacralization (revitalization, reintegration) that is repeated four times: once in the portrayal of the anonymous pre-modern Brangwen generations, and again in the depictions of each of the three named, and progressively more modern, generations, those of Tom and Lydia, Anna and Will, Ursula and Anton. In each section, the typical initiatory pattern of destroy-the-old-then-create-the-new is reversed, with the vitalization phase appearing first and gradually giving way to a disintegrative phase. My investigation concentrates on the initiatory structure of the open- ing section of the novel, which depicts the unnamed Brangwen genera- tions. I also give brief examples of how this structure operates in the</page><page sequence="3">Charles M. Burach 167 section depicting one of the three named generations - that of Anna and Will. In each generational portrait, Lawrences strategy is to attempt to evoke in the reader an experience of a more vital and integrated mode of consciousness and then to remove mental obstacles to increasing the depth, scope and frequency of that new mode. This reversed pattern is often found in the self-initiations of Christian mystics who spontaneously have a spiritual vision and then engage in mortification practices to purge mental and physical hindrances as well as in contemplative and ritual practices to stimulate and intensify spiritual awareness (Underhill 176- 97). As readers proceed through The Rainbow , they are introduced to a fourfold initiatory rhythm of rising and falling energy and of integrated and splintered forms of awareness. In the sections depicting the early Brangwen generations, the vitalization stages are longer and stronger than the destruction phases, whereas in the depictions of the later generations, the reverse is true. Thus, as readers read on, the sense of rising and inte- grating diminishes, and the sense of falling and splintering increases. This sense of falling-disintegrating, which occurs both within and between generations, conveys the experience of the gradual emergence of the mod- ern split subjectivity. The reversal of initiatory phases thus has the double effect of transforming the reader's subjectivity and offering a felt sense of the devolution of European consciousness and of the general fall of humankind. For Lawrence, the Biblical Fall represents a descent from a boundless feeling of connection with the universe to a constricted state of self-consciousness and isolation; the world is no longer experienced with one s "whole being" but rather with the ego, the seat of reflexive thought. Whether or not Lawrence was actually a hierophant, prophet or priest is not the issue. Indeed, there are important difference between these reli- gious roles: the hierophant is primarily concerned with performing initia- tion rites, the prophet with speaking the word of God, and the priest with providing various ministerial services. Nevertheless, all of these roles share the aim of seeking to promote and provoke religious experience - contact with transcendent or immanent divinity. That Lawrence con- ceived of himself as a vatic figure is crucial because this self-conception powerfully shaped the kind of novels he produced or attempted to pro- duce. As early as 1912, he was referring to himself as "a priest of love," and in 1914 and 1915 he tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit his friends for a Utopian religious community that he planned to call Rananim (see Letter 531 in Letters , vol. 1, 493; see also Zytaruk). Though he never realized this dream in life, he tried to portray it in The Plumed Serpent And though he later repudiated his Mexico novel, which seems to justify the use of terror</page><page sequence="4">168 Mosaic 33/3 (September 2000) and murder for religious ends, he initially identified with its hero Don Ramon, who played the multiple religious roles of priest, prophet, initia- tor, aristocrat, savior, and son of God ( The Plumed Serpent 272-73, 291; see Letter 2843 in Letters vol. 4 and Letter 4336 in Letters vol. 6). Every prophet or would-be prophet aims to bring others closer to divinity, and the most successful prophets bring about a fundamental transformation of consciousness - a conversion experience - in those they have influenced. Lawrence's visionary ambitions, fed by abiding pantheis- tic and animistic intuitions, impelled him to try to awaken in his readers a deeply felt experience of the life-energy animating the universe. For him, the felt recognition of the aliveness of the cosmos and of ones fundamen- tal connection to it constitutes the essence of sacred experience. This pre- verbal recognition is a primal, universal human response that is diversely conceptualized by different religions (see Otto). Numinous feelings include wonder, awe, mystery, terror, joy, and a deeply passionate or peace- ful sense of relatedness. These feelings are expressions of the body's ener- gies and sensitive awareness and arise from an encounter that is immediate, unselfconscious, spontaneous, mutual and present-centered. Indeed, Lawrence believed that all living creatures have numinous experi- ences: "Plant consciousness, insect consciousness, fish consciousness, all are related by one permanent element, which we may call the religious ele- ment in all life, even in a flea: the sense of wonder. That is our sixth sense. And it is the natural religious sense" ( Phoenix II 599). As a hierophantic novelist who believed in the unity of body and soul, Lawrence attempted to use language in ways that would touch the reader's somatic modes of experiencing and responding. He did not merely wish to represent numinous feelings but to evoke them in the reader. He thought that such feelings are evoked when readers experience a deep sense of con- nection with the visionary work of art, which is itself the sacred product of the artist's own intense relationships with others. In "The Crown" (1915), he describes art as "the revelation of a pure, an absolute relation between the two eternities" - the antinomies of flesh and spirit, female and male, origin and end, stasis and motion ( Phoenix 7/412). Art is an authentic rev- elation because each perfected relationship reveals, brings into being, the divine: "The true God is created every time a pure relationship, or a con- summation out of twoness into oneness, takes place" (412). In "Morality and the Novel" (1925), Lawrence proclaims that visionary art "gives us the feeling of being beyond life or death" and cites Van Gogh's sunflower paint- ing as an example: "It is a revelation of the perfected relation, at a certain moment, between a man and a sunflower [. . .] [existing] in between</page><page sequence="5">Charles M. Burack 169 everything, in the fourth dimension [that is, in the eternal Now]" ( Phoenix 527-28). But for Lawrence, the quintessential religious art form is the novel because of its ability to represent the widest range of forever-fluctu- ating human connections. In "Art and Morality" (1925), he asserts that the novel is "the highest example of subtle inter-relatedness that man has dis- covered" and the "perfect medium for revealing to us the changing rain- bow of our living relationships" ( Phoenix 528, 532). And in "Why the Novel Matters," he again uses hyperbole when characterizing the novel as "the one bright book of life" that "can make the whole man alive tremble." He even provocatively describes the Bible as "a great confused novel" that is not so much "about God" but "really about man alive" ( Phoenix 535). The Biblical references and rhythms of The Rainbow have been studied. What has not been explored is how the numinous language transforms the reader's consciousness. Because of his vitalistic orientation, Lawrence con- ceived his ultimate religious-artistic task as that of revitalizing the reader. In Studies in Classic American Literature (1923) , Lawrence, like Nietzsche, emphasizes the "double rhythm of creating and destroying" in "true art" (70) (see Zarathustra 25-28; for a discussion of Nietzsche's influence on Lawrence, see Milton, Widmer 40-69, and Montgomery 73-131). This "double rhythm" of art corresponds to the two phases of a religious initia- tion art: one to break down the readers nonvitalistic orientation to self and world, and a second to evoke more vivid and integrated modes of knowing and acting (for a discussion of the double rhythm of initiation in Lady Chatterley's Lover , see Burack). Lawrence was reading anthropological and religious writings about ini- tiation rites in the years before writing The Rainbow. Barbara Miliaras has demonstrated that an early source of his understanding of ancient and comparative religions is his maternal uncle, Fritz Krenkow, who was an Arabic and Semitic scholar with close ties with the Cambridge anthropol- ogists (12-15). Lawrence visited the Krenkows weekly between 1906 and 1910. He was familiar with the works of James Frazer and Jane Harrison, both of whom discuss initiation rites in the context of ancient fertility cults (see also Hinz and Whelan). Emile Delavenay argues that Lawrence was probably exposed to Theosophy "as early as 1908," for at that time Lawrence "takes his place mentally 'inside' a circle of socialists with a penchant for esoteric theories of consciousness" (171). Many of these socialists, like Edward Carpenter, were enthusiastic about Theosophy 's emphasis on the centrality of initiation rites in Eastern and Western eso- teric traditions.</page><page sequence="6">170 Mosaic 33/3 (September 2000) The focus of Lawrence's demolition effort is the modern Western con- sciousness, whether Christian or secular. He insisted that this "mental" or "spiritual" consciousness is dominated by conceptual thought, language and vision. Because mind and will stifle and contort the body's sponta- neous energies and responses, sexual activity is crippled. Thought, speech and sight are all modes of consciousness and communication associated with the head or mind, and Lawrence believed that this overemphasis on head-centered consciousness - and underappreciation of the powers of the rest of the body - produces the mind-body split as well as a sense of rupture between self and other. He accepted Nietzsche's assertion that the fracturing of the Western consciousness was initiated by the ancient Greeks: their high intellectual-visual (Apollonian) culture reified the dis- tinctions within the self, and between self and other (see Phoenix 523 and Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy 33-36). Lawrence may also have been influenced by Coleridge's view "that distinction is not division" (Jack- son 316). In effect, the Greeks made mental distinctions into phenomenal divisions. Today, theorists call this mindset a split subjectivity shaped by logocentrism and ocularcentrism (see Derrida and Jay). Lawrence tries to dissolve the logocentrism and ocularcentrism of his readers in order to allow their nonverbal and nonvisual modes of consciousness to come into awareness (for a discussion of affinities between Derrida and Lawrence, see Doherty and Bonds). This quieting of the conceptual, reflexive mind is a fundamental meditative technique (Underhill 316-27 and Wilber 302- 27). Lawrence's quasi-meditative techniques seek to suppress the concep- tual mind by lulling it with imagistic and rhythmic techniques or by repelling it with images that induce repugnant feelings. Such repugnant feelings are painful and potentially purgative. Lawrence believed that a "really new novel will always hurt" ( Phoenix 531). In The Rainbowy the vitalization phases are replete with mystical concepts and resonances because he associated mysticism with an unselfconscious, receptive, unitive experience. In the novel's opening pages, the sacred encounters of the anonymous, pre-modern Brangwens are represented in language that sometimes echoes the early passages of Genesis or involves a further sensualization of those passages. The Biblical references, mostly to the divine act of creation and to the Garden of Eden, involve mythic events that Lawrence thought symbolize the divine potencies that exist within and beyond the world. Lawrence often conceives Biblical events as figurations of psycho-spiritual events. For him, the Garden of Eden sym- bolizes a sustained state of mystical union with the immanent God. In the</page><page sequence="7">Charles M. Burack 171 novels first few pages, references to the Brangwens' knowing "the inter- course between heaven and earth," having "ample" resources, living lives "full and surcharged," and having "senses full fed," indicate that the unnamed generations possess a relatively integrated mode of conscious- ness grounded in sensation and feeling (41). Lawrence believed that Adam and Eve experienced this mode of consciousness before they fell into conflicted, self-conscious and shame-ridden sexuality, and into a sense of separation from the living environment around them and from the passionate forces within (41). Indeed, in The Symbolic Meaning , he explains the Fall as the loss of the original integrity and harmony of the psyche (127). Because the prelapsarian Adam and Eve had their basic bodily needs met and lived in harmony with the numinous natural sur- roundings, they experienced a sense of fullness and ampleness: in Genesis 2:9, the newly created Adam experiences the trees as sensually fulfilling - they are "pleasant to the sight, and good for food." Lawrence interprets the sense of plenitude and pleasure in prelapsarian Eden as meaning that a sense of fulfillment is a natural state of being. Fulfillment is natural because "there is always excess, a brimming over" in nature and because every human being "is a well-head built over a strong, perennial spring" (Phoenix 421-22). The excess in nature is the divine energy. The pre- modern Brangwens bestir themselves in action more than in talk and reflection, and their mode of knowing is fed by abundant feeling and sen- sation. Whelan has identified their mode of consciousness as Medieval because the church still has an authentically mystical value for them and because the body is glorified (see Whelan 113, 123-24, 178). For Law- rence, the Medieval consciousness involves a full-bodied awareness of the cosmos. In a December 20, 1914 letter, he tells Gordon Campbell that he has had glimpses of the Medieval vision: "It is necessary to grasp the Whole. At last I have got it, grasping something of what the mediaeval church tried to express" (Letter 828 in Letters , vol. 2, 249). He thought that the rapid growth of visual and verbal culture which began in the Renaissance eventually produced a devaluation of body and cosmos. In "Study of Thomas Hardy," Lawrence says that from the sixteenth century onward, "man is more and more occupied with his own experience" and "less and less aware of anything unknown" (Phoenix 456). Lawrence uses several techniques to evoke in the reader a more unified mode of consciousness approximating that of the Medieval Brangwens. One device is the striking use of pluralized protagonists. For the first four and a half paragraphs, the protagonist is "the Brangwens"; in the middle of the fifth paragraph it becomes "the men"; and by the sixth paragraph it</page><page sequence="8">172 Mosaic 33/3 (September 2000) is "the women" (41-42). The movement from people to men to women is crafted to slowly bring the reader's awareness to a progressively more dif- ferentiated, articulate and self-conscious state of mind, and to produce a sense of rising and falling. In the first few paragraphs, the collective, ungendered treatment of the multiple Brangwen generations not only stresses the relative impersonality and uniformity of their thought and action over time, but also attempts to activate the instinctual, preverbal, generically human dimensions of the reader's mind. The narrator strives to activate these dimensions by occluding sexual distinction and focusing on the collective actions and attitudes of the Brangwen "people" (41). The Brangwens in effect represent a kind of archetypal humanity, like the androgynous Primal Adam (Genesis 1:26-2:22), before Eve is split off from his side. Most of the descriptions in the first half dozen paragraphs seem to apply to both Brangwen men and women. None of their charac- teristics, activities and attitudes - expectancy, freshness, slow speech, sense of ampleness, thrift, farmwork - is explicitly or even tacitly gen- dered. Moreover, their distinguishing features are represented with very broad strokes: "There was a look in the eyes of the Brangwens as if they were expecting something unknown"; "They were fresh, blond, slow-speaking people"; "the Brangwens came and went without fear of necessity"; "they had forgotten what it was like to be in straitened circum- stances"; "Neither were they thriftless"; "They felt the rush of the sap" (42- 43). The ungendered, plural description is interrupted only once in the opening paragraphs: in the first paragraph, masculine pronouns ("he," "him") appear, but they are easily read as gender neutral since they qual- ify "one": "Whenever one of the Brangwens in the fields lifted his head from his work, he saw the church-tower at Ilkeston in the empty sky. So that as he turned again to the horizontal land, he was aware of something standing above him and beyond him in the distance" (41). Thus, for four and a half paragraphs, the reader is steeped in the archetypal perspective of a pluralized protagonist. But in the middle of the fifth paragraph, the narrator suddenly intro- duces sexual difference into the reader's mind when the pluralized protag- onist becomes "men": "The young corn waved and was silken and the lustre slid along the limbs of the men who saw it. They took the udder of the cows, the cows yielded milk and pulse against the hands of the men, the pulse of the blood of the teats of the cows beat into the pulse of the hands of the men" (42). The shift in subject from "the Brangwens" to "the men" causes the reader to wonder whether the entire fifth paragraph describing the farm activities, and perhaps all the preceding paragraphs,</page><page sequence="9">Charles M. Burach 173 are meant to refer only to the Brangwen men. The delay in introducing sexual difference is not meant to suggest that awareness of sexual differ- ence is absent in an integrated consciousness but that such awareness is not self-reflexive. Significantly, the reader s awareness of sexual difference emerges only in retrospect: actions and attitudes that had seemed gender neutral now appear to be masculine. In this way, Lawrence shows how reflection produces a self-conscious sense of difference. The conflation of the gender neutral and the masculine recalls Primal Adam, who is simulta- neously androgynous and male (the Hebrew word "Adam" is masculine). It is only in the sixth paragraph that the narrator clearly distinguishes the men and the women: "then the men sat by the fire in the house where the women moved about with surety, and the limbs and the body of the men were impregnated with the day, cattle and earth and vegetation and the sky, the men sat by the fire and their brains were inert, as their blood flowed heavy with the accumulation from the living day" (42). This para- graph not only differentiates the sexes but also suggests that the outdoor forms of intercourse described in the previous paragraph mainly, but not exclusively, involve the men. In subsequent Brangwen generations, out- door interaction will diminish as domestic activities increase, a sign of the growing alienation from the natural environment brought about by mod- ern urbanization, commerce and science. The growth of modern civiliza- tion is thus associated with the domestication - the housing and taming - of humankind. The sense of sexual difference is both intensified and blurred in the next paragraph when the reader is explicitly informed of both female difference and similarity: "The women were different. On them too was the drowse of the blood-intimacy, calves sucking and hens running together in droves and young geese palpitating in the hand while the food was pushed down their throttle. But the women looked out from the heated, blind inter- course of farm-life, to the spoken world beyond" (42). The difference is one of degree of immersion in the immediate milieu: the men are totally immersed in "exchange and interchange" with "earth and sky and beast and green plants" while the women are only partially absorbed. The women are conscious of and "wanted another form of life" (43). They have a split subjectivity produced by their desire for "the world beyond [. . .] the far-off world of cities and governments" in which "knowledge" and "the other, magic language" determine who is "the master" (43-44). Lawrence in effect feminizes the desire for civilization and attributes this desire to female disharmony and dissatisfaction with the numinous natural environment, that is, with the immanent God. In contrast, the</page><page sequence="10">174 Mosaic 33/3 (September 2000) Biblical account blames Eve for initiating the rebellion against the tran- scendental God who creates, but is beyond, nature. Lawrence also implic- itly links house and city, domestication and civilization, by presenting them as unsatisfying "indoor" alternatives to open-air living. In effect, a city is like a big house which insulates its inhabitants from the wilderness around them. Lawrence adopts the Biblical position of blaming women for human conflict: like Eve, the Brangwen women have a double desire to eat of both the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. In The Symbolic Meaning, Lawrence asserts that the story of Eve and the serpent represents the inception of split subjectivity: The Eve myth symbolizes the birth of the upper mind, the upper con- sciousness which, the moment it becomes self-conscious, rebels against the physical being, and is sensible of shame because of its own helpless connection with the passional body. The serpent is the symbol of division in the psyche [. . .] the divider, which sets spiritual being against sensual being, man against woman, sex against sex, the introducer of the hostile duality into the human psyche." (39) Lawrence's Eve falls out of the harmonious relationship she once had with the divine passion in her body, while the Genesis Eve uses her body (by eating the apple) to rebel against the transcendent God. Once sexual difference is fully established in the opening passage, there is a shift from pluralized to singular protagonists. For Lawrence, the awareness of the distinction between male and female is simultaneously a recognition of the distinction between the one and the many, self and other, inner and outer. The next two paragraphs describe the outlook ("looked out") of "the woman" - her distant, visual perspective on "the activity of the world at large" and on men engaged in "fighting outwards to knowledge" (43). The female focus on the outer as utterly distinct from the inner is the first main rupture in consciousness. Lawrence believes that in an integrated mode of knowing, the outer is experienced as the expression, utterance or manifestation of the inner, just as the immanent divinity is an emanation of the transcendental Godhead. Eventually the Brangwen woman compares the vicar to "her own menfolk" and con- cludes that his "soul was master" of theirs because he possesses greater "knowledge" (44). It is the readers mind that has also been subjected to more and finer distinctions, and hence to greater degrees of analytic knowledge. Such knowledge involves the creation of new categories, new names; appropriately, at the end of the paragraph, a Brangwen man is</page><page sequence="11">Charles M. Burack 175 finally named: "What power had the vicar over Tom Brangwen - none. Yet strip them and set them on a desert island, and the vicar was the master [. . .] it was a question of knowledge" (44). The overall movement from Brangwen "people" to "men"/"women" to "a woman"/"Tom Brangwen" parallels the movement in Genesis from androgynous Primal Man to prelapsarian Adam and Eve to postlapsarian Adam and Eve. In effect, the reader receives a taste of the Tree of Life (integrated consciousness) and ends with a taste of the Tree of Knowledge (split consciousness). Let us return to the opening paragraphs of the novel to examine some other sacralizing devices. One of the most evocative paragraphs in the opening section, the fifth, is the one that describes "the heated, blind intercourse of farm-life" (41-42). The images involve contact, interpéné- tration and exchange between the Brangwens and their nonhuman but living environment. The order of the images is significant: the first set of images depicts the Brangwens s passive experience of the powerful activi- ties of the plant and mineral worlds, while the second set describes their active engagement with and mastery over the animal world. This order suggests to readers that any attempt to master nature should be predicated on connection with and appreciation of its power, beauty, vital value. The sentences describing the felt experience of plants and minerals are punctuated so as to suggest their to and fro, oscillating movements: "They felt the rush of the sap in spring, they knew the wave which cannot halt, but every year throws forward the seed to begetting, and, falling back, leaves the young-born on the earth. They knew the intercourse between heaven and earth, sunshine drawn into the breast and bowels, the rain sucked up in the daytime, nakedness that comes under the wind in autumn, showing the birds' nests no longer worth hiding" (42). In the first clause of the first sentence the speed ("rush") of the sap is stressed, while the rest of the sentence mimes the motion of the wave. The waves unhalt- ing movement described in the second clause is enacted in the third clause, which also specifies its forward direction. The sense of the wave hitting its crest and hanging suspended is suggested by the "and" set off in commas; and the wave's quick fall is evoked by the brevity of "falling back." The sentence also enacts in miniature the sense of rising and falling that the novel as a whole is trying to convey. The relation between the first clause (describing the sap) and the second (describing the wave) is delib- erately ambiguous: the wave could be a metaphor for the sap's move- ments, for the specific life-energy producing the sap's movement, or for a more general wave of energy that engenders plant life. This blurring of the specific and the general produces a sense of the imbeddedness of the</page><page sequence="12">176 Mosaic 33/3 (September 2000) particular plant in its living environment; it is also part of the narrator's overall strategy in this section of gradually differentiating the reader's consciousness, of introducing distinctions but not divisions. In the second sentence the somatic forms and functions of the minerals are emphasized; the language relies on anthropomorphism, but not on personification: it draws its figures from the human body ("breast," "bowels," "sucked," "nakedness"), but not from the personality. When the Brangwens's active engagement with animals is depicted, their gentle mastery is stressed. It is not a mastery that overwhelms and destroys; the word "will" does not even appear until the end of the pas- sage: "They took the udder of the cows, the cows yielded milk and pulse against the hands of the men, the pulse of the blood of the teats of the cows beat into the pulse of the hands of the men. They mounted their horses, and held life between the grip of their knees, they harnessed their horses at the wagon, and, with hand on the bridle-rings, drew the heaving of the horses after their will" (42). Though the men are clearly controlling the cows and horses, the animals' rhythms ("pulse," "heaving") are power- fully present and are conveyed to the men. The transmission of rhythms is represented by a repetition of words and meter: "the pulse of the blood of the teats of the cows [. . .] the pulse of the hands of the men." As in the pas- sage describing the plants and minerals, there is a conflation of the spe- cific and the general, but this time the conflation is unambiguous: the horses are explicitly figured as "life." What distinguishes the forms of intercourse described in this opening section from those depicted in the subsequent accounts of the named generations is not only the pluralized protagonist but also the nearly exclusive focus on exchanges with the nonhuman environment. Human- human interchanges involving the Medieval Brangwens are implied but only briefly described. They are a "slow-speaking" people who rarely engage in conversation. And while the opening pages suggest that the Brangwens attend church and have business dealings, these activities are vaguely and incidentally treated. The focus of their energies seems to be on the natural world. It is also significant that their sex lives are elided. This elision becomes more evident in retrospect, after the sex lives of the named generations are described in detail. The erotic tone of the opening paragraphs suggests that libidinal energy also suffuses their domestic rela- tions: the reader senses that silence and sensuality are palpable in the Brangwen homes. More generally, the narratorial omission of their sex lives indicates that these pre-modern generations hark back to a time when erotic energy was not as self-consciously reserved for, or exclusively</page><page sequence="13">Charles M. Burack 177 channeled into, sexual activity. The anonymity of those generations underlines the intimation that words - naming - played a less significant role in shaping their erotic activities. It was a time before sexual dis- courses created sex and sexuality as distinctive forms of bodily contact and pleasure. The fall from integrated to fragmented modes of consciousness also occurs in the three named Brangwen generations. The key difference is that each of these more modern generations begins adulthood with a suc- cessively less integrated consciousness and then descends to an ever more chaotic and violent mindset, especially as evidenced in their erotic rela- tions. Sexual encounters become the sites in which the integrated and dis- integrated modes of consciousness most vividly manifest themselves. The erotic couplings are crucial because Lawrence believed that "In the act of love [. . .] Man is with God and of God" and that sexual intercourse is "the deepest of all communions" and "the greatest [mystery], as almost every initiation shows, showing the supreme achievement of the mystic mar- riage" (Phoenix 466; Phoenix II 505-6). While the overall structure of revi- talize-then-destroy is present in the depictions of the named generation, the emphasis is more and more on the destructive element. This disinte- grative dimension is most evident in Ursula and Anton's relationship and least evident in Tom and Lydias relationship. Will and Anna's relationship occupies an intermediate position between these two. The psychonarra- tions of the sexual encounters of each generation are accordingly crafted to evoke comparable modes of consciousness in the reader. As the reader moves through the novel, the mortification effects increase in number and intensity and create a sense of historical devolution. In general, the revitalizing passages are structured by metaphors that blur or bridge distinctions between self and other and by mystical dis- courses that are intended to arouse awe and wonder in the reader. The vivid mystical language points to both an unknowable, transcendent Godhead existing behind and beyond the world and to immanent divine forces that permeate the world, especially, the erotic human body. While nearly all of the sexual encounters between Tom and Lydia are structured by these revitalizing devices (95, 99, 132, 133, 168), only about two-thirds of Anna and Will's erotic exchanges are so constructed (185, 190, 197, 277, 279). And less than a quarter of Ursula and Anton's exchanges con- tain sacralizing techniques (337-39). Thus, as readers move through the novel, they are meant to experience a progressive drop in vivifying and integrating effects. Conversely, disintegrative techniques can be found in none of the mature erotic scenes involving Tom and Lydia, in about a</page><page sequence="14">178 Mosaic 33/3 (September 2000) third of those involving Anna and Will (208, 226), and in nearly all of those involving Ursula and Anton (372, 514, 516, 523, 529, 532). These scenes are structured by hunting or combat metaphors coupled with the discourse of magic, mesmerism and hypnosis. While mysticism stresses the egoless union with divinity out of a sense of love, reverence or obedi- ence, magic emphasizes the calling forth of numinous force to attain human, and sometimes selfish, ends. Lawrence, like Theosophy's founder, Helen Blavatsky, disparaged the egoistic and willful aspects of magic. He was also critical of its intellectual emphasis. He regarded mesmerism and hypnotism as degraded, quasi-scientific offshoots of magic that also seek knowledge and control. Let us conclude by briefly examining how the revitalizing and mortify- ing devices operate in the depictions of Anna and Will's sexual exchanges. Mystical resonances predominate in the early encounters, just before and after marriage, suggesting that the relationship is initially fed by the vital energy and openness of youth; however, because the relationship quickly becomes unbalanced, the energy is shunted into internecine combat and both partners become depleted, Anna emerging as the empty-handed vic- tor. Anna and Will come of age in the second half of the 19th century and their interactions are shaped by the mode of consciousness that Lawrence associates with the rapid rise of industry and science. For him, this rise represents the ascendency of the male principle of mind and its culmina- tion in the machine principle. The motion of machines produces friction which slowly grinds down the parts. Similarly, individuals who grow up in the machine age and value mind over body develop friction-filled rela- tionships that wear them down. Anna and Will, and subsequent Brang- wen generations, develop a modern, post-Renaissance, mentality. Sacralizing devices are deployed in the scenes describing Will and Anna's honeymoon experiences. These descriptions concentrate on how the couple experience the world - the outer world and their shared inner world - rather than on how they experience each other. In general, the exchanges focus on the awareness and bridging of boundaries between inner and outer. A series of extended metaphors based on the inner-outer polarity are intended not only to bridge or blur self-other distinctions in the reader's mind but also to have a cumulative vivifying effect and to demonstrate the relative, dynamic value of any particular incarnation of divine energy. The metaphors, most of which can be found in the "Study of Thomas Hardy," link the inner-outer polarity in the human world to a like polarity in other organic life and in the cosmos at large. Thus, the</page><page sequence="15">Charles M. Burack 179 reader cornes to feel that this fundamental opposition can be bridged in all realms of existence. That is, the overcoming of a dualistic relationship with another person or with oneself is fundamentally tied to the over- coming of dualistic responses to nonhuman beings. For example, a group of botanic metaphors is used to indicate that the shift from Will s bachelor life to his married life involves the discarding of his self's peripheral, rougher, worldly interests in favor of its core, sensi- tive, vital impulses. The discovery and development of these impulses is understood as the beginning of a new organic cycle, of a rebirth, and is figured as the unshelling and planting of a nut or seed in fertile soil: So suddenly, everything that had been before was shed away and gone. One day, he was a bachelor, living with the world. The next day, he was with her, as remote from the world as if the two of them were buried like a seed in darkness. Suddenly, like a chestnut falling out of a burr, leaving behind him the hard rind of worldly knowledge and experience. He heard it in the hucksters' cries, the noise of carts, the calling children. And it was all like the hard, shed rind, discarded. Inside, in the softness and stillness of the room, was the naked kernel, that palpitated in silent activity, absorbed in reality. (185) There is a double erasure of boundaries in the image of "the two of them were buried like a seed in darkness": the boundary between him and her; and the boundary between them and the surrounding darkness. Together, the couple constitute "a [single] seed" that is itself merged with its earthy environment. A sense of being beyond time is conveyed by reflecting the single feeling of being unhusked in a variety of simultaneous surrounding actions: the hucksters' cries, the carts' nose, the children's calling. This sense of simultaneity is also created by the repeated attempts to configure the unhusking process: "buried like a seed"; "like a chestnut falling out of a burr"; and "like the hard, shed rind, discarded." The effort here is to remove the "rind" of the reader's mindset and allow a greater sense of unity. The seed figures indicate a concentric model of the self, with vital, fragile substance at the center, and expendable, protective qualities at the perimeter. An example of a disintegrative scene involving Anna and Will occurs a few years after Ursula is born. In this scene, the language of hypnotism is deployed in the context of a hunt metaphor. Will is figured as a black tom- cat who stealthily and hypnotically overcomes his feline mate: Sometimes, when his eyes met her, a yellow flash from them caused a darkness to swoon over her consciousness, electric, and a slight strange</page><page sequence="16">180 Mosaic 33/3 (September 2000) laugh came on his face. Her eyes would turn languidly, then close, as if hypnotized. And they lapsed into the same potent darkness. He had the quality of a young black cat, intent, unnoticeable, and yet his presence gradually made itself felt, stealthily and powerfully took hold of her. He called, not to her, but to something in her, which responded subtly, out of her unconscious darkness. [. . .] Only she knew him when the darkness set him free, and he could see with his gold-glowing eyes his intention and his desires in the dark. Then she was in a spell, then she answered his harsh, penetrating call with a soft leap of her soul, the darkness woke up, electric, bristling with an unknown, overwhelming insinuation. (258) The focus on eyes indicates that mind-driven maneuvering is involved. The hypnotic stealth results in sexual manipulation, not mutual ex- change. The passage thus creates subliminal links between excessive visu- ality and coercion. And though Will and Anna "lapsed into the same darkness," there remains a sense of separation between them, unlike in the revitalizing passages. This episode is also more narrative than the sacraliz- ing scenes and so does not convey a transformed sense of time-conscious- ness. The vividly detailed encounter can be expected to produce various types of repulsion in the reader: fear, suspicion, disgust. These repulsive emotions are subconsciously linked to a hypervisual, willful orientation. The repetition of "darkness" serves to batter the reader's own ocular, coer- cive tendencies. We have seen that some of the most powerful textual effects in The Rain- bow are attributable to Lawrence's innovative use of the religious initia- tion rite. He deployed this form to achieve the religious end of transforming the reader's consciousness. The novel is thus hierophantic in its aim and underlying structure. I believe that the initiatory structure - conceived as a rhythm of destroying and creating aimed at spiritual trans- formation - is a significant technical contribution to modernist literature. And I suspect that this structure can found in works by other visionary modernists inspired by Nietzsche's view of the artist as destroyer-creator. In examining how literary technique shapes the flow of consciousness in the reader, I have tried to demonstrate the value of linking a poetics of technique to a phenomenology of the reading experience. Because the split consciousness is a major subject of inquiry today, I believe it is worthwhile to explore the various literary techniques used to accentuate or heal these splits.</page><page sequence="17">Charles M.
