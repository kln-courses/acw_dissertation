Biology of the lobster Homarus americanus.-Pub- lished by Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, California, U.S.A. Pp. i-xvi, 1-528. Lobsters, those most unlikely, and yet most emotive of marine invertebrates, as- sume mythical proportions in the culture of the eastern seaboard of North America. Jan Robert Factor's book pays homaridian hom- age on the centennial of Francis Hobart Herrick's first monograph on the American lobster. Herrick (1909) boasted "Our knowledge of the lobster has increased to such an extent during the past fifteen years that in all probability there is no marine in- vertebrate in the world which is now better known" and envisaged not only restoring depleted Atlantic fisheries but also estab- lishing new ones in other parts of the world. Thus, Factor's tome is compelling both for its subject and as an opportunity to measure scientific progress from Herrick's founda- tion. While lobsters are still among the best understood crustaceans, Herrick's original work remains unchallenged for natural his- tory and his descriptions have been sur- passed only with the advent of technology such as the electron microscope and SCU- BA. (In recognition, Factor reproduces sev- eral figures by Herrick and a contemporary, P. B. Hadley.) Indeed, we still pursue Her- rick's Utopian vision of fisheries restoration and his "dark puzzles" about stock declines and recruitment have become a mantra for fisheries biologists, echoing unanswered through the century. Clearly, Factor comes not to bury Herrick but to praise him; one hundred years after publication, Herrick's monograph is a hard act to follow. Factor and his 20 authors cover a broad swath of American lobster biology. Their 18 chapters range from pure to applied sci- ence, shifting in scale from micro- to oceano- graphic, yet reflect similar topics to Herrick (1909). Naturally, as fisheries have driven much of the research, commercially related aspects figure largely in 6 chapters, while the remainder target morphology and physiological processes. The stated aim is to provide both modern perspective and his- torical overview of the largely undigested literature for a wide audience. J. R. Factor opens with "Introduction, Anatomy, and Life History" (Chapter 1) followed by A. Williams' crisp, dry but necessary account of "Taxonomy and Evo- lution" (Chapter 2). The stage set, G. P. En- nis confronts the moraine of fragmentary and often contradictory studies related to "Larval and Postlarval Ecology" (Chapter 3). The prose is cluttered by information on life history, in general, and larval rearing, in particular, covered in following chapters. Indeed, Ennis travels similar ground to his previous review (Campbell, 1986) and later references are scant. Poignantly, even the questions in Directions for Future Research on stock-recruitment relationships are es- sentially the same as posed a decade pre- viously, despite the claim that there have been significant advances in larval ecology over the past 15 years. Unfortunately, a re- cent thesis on larval locomotor activity is missed and thus the opportunity to erect new hypotheses on transport rather than broadly surmise on recruitment mecha- nisms. P. Lawton and K. L. Lavalli tackle "Postlarval, Juvenile, Adolescent and Adult Ecology" (Chapter 4), an area that has stimulated considerable research in this de- cade and in which most current lobster con- troversies lurk. Such material fuels this pro- gressive chapter, with the authors not only rendering a diversity of studies into a stim- ulating systhesis but also drawing state-of- the-art inferences, including a novel life history scheme. However, again, there is overlap with material in other chapters, most noticeably basic life history and nat- ural diet, and why is Geographic Range and Distribution here and not in Chapter 1? Also, because of sequential consideration of each life-history stage, treatment of feeding and natural diet is patchy and repetitious. The Table of Food Items does not cite all the references provided in the text and there is contradiction about whether algae are eaten. R. J. Miller gives a lucid account of "Fisheries Regulations and Methods" (Chapter 5) and contrasts technical aspects of management and marketing between 817</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY, VOL. 16, NO. 4, 1996 Canada and the U.S.A. Included is a treatise on fishing gear, Miller's forte, and an inter- esting case for community-based manage- ment. Miller concludes with musings on the lobster fishery in the year 2020, but the venerable seer does not prophesy on re- source responses to more enlightened man- agement. Linkages between regulations and population ecology are tenuous, underscor- ing why lobster management remains more an act of faith than a science. M. J. Fogarty on "Populations, Fisheries, and Manage- ment" (Chapter 6) provides further context to the previous three chapters. As manage- ment acts through regulations that suppos- edly stem from biological understanding, Chapters 5 and 6 might have been amal- gamated; particularly, since information on the fishery, including history, regulations, and landings, is in both. Nevertheless, Fo- garty provides an enlightening discourse on population structure and excellent treat- ments of both population dynamics and models. The latter are beguiling, although their predictive efficacy is limited and Fo- garty makes a justifiable plea for better in- tegration of ecology. J. S. Cobb answers with "Interface of Ecology, Behavior, and Fisheries" (Chapter 7), exploring the un- derstanding necessary to lift the veil on re- cruitment mechanisms and improve predic- tion. While the chapter nicely educes the lobster world, it also duplicates material in previous chapters and is too brief to take the commanding position the title merits. A comprehensive treatment of "Aquaculture" (Chapter 8) is provided by the prolific team of D. E. Aiken and S. L. Waddy. Almost inevitably, given that most aquaculture re- search has been pursued in isolation from work on wild stocks, considerable biologi- cal information is repeated from other chap- ters. The dream of large-scale culture has faded, but Aiken and Waddy concur with Herrick on the promise of enhancement. Once again, realization of the latter will de- pend on more effective interdisciplinary studies. Most remaining chapters (about two- thirds of the book) are a drastic change in approach, a "how-to" manual with many electron micrographs exploding the lobster into its respective "engine parts." P. Talbot and S. Helluy provide a thorough review of "Reproduction and Embryonic Develop- ment" (Chapter 9), covering reproductive anatomy, gametogenesis, fertilization, and embryology. S. L. Waddy and D. E. Aiken return with D. P. V. de Kleijn on "Control of Growth and Reproduction" (Chapter 10). The text is lucid but could have been consolidated into previous chapters on lar- vae (Chapter 3), nutrition (Chapter 8), and spawning (Chapter 9). B. Beltz's account of "Neurobiology and Neuroendocrinology" (Chapter 11) provides deep insight into the structure and functioning of the nervous system. C. K. Govind's "Muscles and their Innervation" (Chapter 12) relies largely on the definitive body of work built by his own team over the past 20 years. As for Chapter 11, the depth of Govind's work reflects the "rare blend of virtues" that lobsters afford neurobiologists rather than commercial considerations; alas, such dichotomy is not without price and Govind perpetuates a myth about lobster longevity that has long since been revised in the fisheries literature (Chapter 6). Anthropomorphic behavioral descriptions in J. Atema and R. Voigt's "Behavior and Sensory Biology" (Chapter 13) jar against the fine-grained accounts of anatomy and physiology of sensory struc- tures and repeat ecological and reproductive aspects expounded in previous chapters. "The Feeding Appendages" (Chapter 14) are illustrated and reviewed in meticulous detail by K. L. Lavalli and J. R. Factor. J. R. Factor also reports on anatomy and de- velopment of "The Digestive System" (Chapter 15). D. E. Conklin follows with "Digestive Physiology and Nutrition" (Chapter 16) of all life history stages, gleaned from both the natural and aquacul- tural perspectives (the former overlapping with accounts of foraging and diet in Chap- ter 4). G. G. Martin and J. E. Hose present "Circulation, the Blood, and Disease" (Chapter 17), demolishing the traditional view that open circulatory systems are slug- gish with little regulation. Disease, margin- alized into a rudimentary three-page "add- on," could have warranted its own chapter based on implications to both fisheries and aquaculture. The book concludes with B. R. McMahon's "Physiology of Gas Exchange, Circulation, Ion Regulation, and Nitroge- nous Excretion: An Integrative Approach" (Chapter 18), a succinct account of the in- 818</page><page sequence="3">819 terrelationships in this poorly understood area. The overall impression of Factor's book is of an unbalanced series of disconnected reviews that advance only marginally be- yond existing workshop proceedings (Phil- lips and Cobb, 1977; Campbell, 1986) and two volumes by Cobb and Phillips (1980). Overlap between chapters is not substitu- tion for integration of scale, disciplines, and processes; sadly, in most of the chapters, readers will receive a potpourri rather than a distillation of homarid information. The subtext is that lack of interrelationships is a shortcoming exemplified by the history of research on the beast itself. Successions of strong individual lobster scientists and "ecological fads" have each tried to ex- plain everything from a narrow pedestal... and ultimately understood little. Thus, ev- ery decade has its own unique picture of lobsters, with successive cabals largely fail- ing to build on previous work. Frustrating duplication of topics throughout Factor's book appears symptomatic of the same phe- nomenon, each with the author's particular bias in interpretation. The rerenderings could have been minimized by stronger ed- itorial control, giving more space for enig- mas of central importance, such as genetics and the behavioral, physiological, and oceanographic influences on recruitment, problems neither adequately probed in the book nor concertedly addressed by lobster biologists. In conclusion, a century ago, Herrick built a sound natural history foundation for the American lobster and pointed the way for future research. Factor's book shows that advances have been limited and lobster biologists have yet to deliver the goods. Ironically, Factor fails in not following Her- rick's credos of holism; surely if the nature of any marine invertebrate is greater than the sum of its parts, it is Homarus with its attendant folklore and innate mysteries. Such "soul" is not elucidated by a reduc- tionist approach, rather it is appreciated by consolidation and interdisciplinary synthe- sis, where physiological mechanisms inter- face between behavior and population dy- namics and where anatomy grows to func- tional morphology and links to behavioral ecology. Readers will be left with a sober- ing paradox in surveying a burgeoning lit- erature yet trying to ascertain where scien- tific progress can be judged a success. De- spite tremendous expenditures, there are too many unanswered questions about basic life history and a lamentable lack of predictive capability. Thus, we neither retain Herrick's poetry nor have achieved a markedly deep- er understanding of lobsters. At a price of US$195, this lavish volume appears likely to become part of the personal collection of only serious (and rich) devotees of lobster- ology. Nevertheless, Factor (1995) should become a standard library text, standing both as a benchmark and a metaphor on the cost of unstructured science into the next century. Hopefully, by 2095 the "dark puz- zles" will be solved, and Herrick's ghost can finally rest.-Robert W.
