<plain_text><page sequence="1">OKPELLA MASKING TRADITIONS JEAN M. BORGATTI T he Okpella (Ukpila)' are an Edo-speaking people liv- ing approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City and 24-32 kilometers west of the Niger River. Located in what is now north central Bendel State, Okpella counts among its neighbors to the south, east, and west other Edo- speaking peoples, and to the north, the Igbira. Like many other northern Edo groups, Okpella traces its origins to Benin, and its migration is of uncertain date. Traditionally, the northern Edo-a designation that re- places the older, pejorative term "Kukuruku"-are small, acephalous societies speaking related, but often mutually unintelligible, languages. The more northern groups remained on the fringes of the Benin empire and main- tained only nominal allegiance to the Oba by the nineteenth century. After the mid-nineteenth century, the history of the area was one of upheaval and disruption as many small villages fell prey to Nupe raiding parties from thsg -WON Aw AW- 1. AMINAGUE MASKED SPIRIT ACCOMPANIED BY A CUSTODIAN PLAYING THE FLUTE. the north. Many of the villages, including those of Okpella, were broken up as inhabitants scattered, seeking refuge deep in the hills. The villages reformed around the turn of the century after the establishment of the pax Britannica. Today, the Okpella number about 24,000 people2 living in nine villages and utilizing approximately 518 square kilometers of communal land. They recognize two major subdivisions, corresponding roughly to east and west, representing the two sons of Okpella, the clan founder. Western Okpella comprises five villages, and eastern Okpella, three. A remaining village represents the descen- dants of earlier settlers from Benin who were culturally dominated by Okpella. Traditions of autochthonous peo- ples persist in both eastern and western Okpella.3 Ritual and kinship link the villages of Okpella rather than political authority, although the British established the position of paramount chief shortly after the turn of the century. Political authority at the village level is vested in a council of titled elders (Itsogwa) (Borgatti, 1975). Paramount ritual authority is in the hands of a night society (Ilukpekpe), organized at the quarter level, although the leadership of the two organizations overlaps. Traditionally, the Okpella people believe in a supreme deity Eshinegba, creator of all things in the material world (agbo) and the spirit world (ilimi)-paralleling Bini belief (Bradbury, 1970.52). However, the spirits that most con- cern an individual are his/her immediate ancestors or the collective ancestors of any group to which he/she belongs. For example, an artist (atsona) may invoke the spirits of past artists (ilimi itsona) before undertaking a new work. Individuals and small cult groups may also serve shrines dedicated to spiritual forces localized around certain natural phenomena and sometimes identified with mythical heroes, again paralleling Bini religious practice (Bradbury, 1970.56). Men, and some women, may also belong to one or more cult groups-cum-masquerade societies whose focus is the control of anti-social forces, chiefly witchcraft. Ilukpekpe, a night society and paramount ritual authority, is found in all Okpella villages. A second night society, lyabana, junior and prerequisite for Ilukpekpe where both are found, is widely distributed but not universal. An ancestral cult organized around a powerful medicine called "Something that kills quickly" (Ogbedughulu) is found only in the three eastern villages and four of the seven quarters of the largest western village. A fourth cult, Aminague, is found in all Okpella villages but one, the smallest village of the eastern sector. Ilukpekpe, lyabana, and Ogbedughulu members act in concert in an annual masking festival (Olimi) held in those villages or quarters housing an Ogbedughulu shrine. The Aminague cult operates independently of Ilukpekpe or the Olimi festival complex. An additional masking society, Okakagbe, func- tions primarily in the social realm. 24 1 OLIMIFESTIVAL HERALD (ANOGIRI)</page><page sequence="2">I ,1-- \V~~I~r</page><page sequence="3">At the end of the dry season, traditionally the end of the year, each compound head offers food-for-the-dead (akhilimni) to propitiate ancestral spirits for the year to come. Prior to the advent of Islam and Christianity (prior to 1880), the largest western village held the festival of Amninague at this time as well. Since the turn of the century, however, four of the nine Okpella villages, including the largest western village, have begun holding the Olinmi masking festival instead to honor the ancestors and purify the community for the new year. The history of the mask- ing groups-Aminague, Olimi, and Okakagbe-and the network of rela- tionships they reflect are the focus of this paper. The name and image of Aminague em- body the English-language concepts of the "incredible"-something never before seen and therefore unbelievable-and the "forbidden"-something with which one's relationship is necessarily restricted. Accompanied by a custodian, the masked figure carries a switch and wears a woven raffia headdress framed by a waist-length raffia fringe (abunuku), a cloth appliqu6 apron (obete), and rattling ankle sheaths (ikolo) made of palm fronds folded to en- case clusters of seeds (Fig. 1). The "head" is polychromed red, black, and white, and d 3. ATSOGWA TITLE CANDIDATE WEARING THE REGALIA ASSOCIATED WITH THE OGHALO CEREMONY. elaborated with a strip of cut aluminum (ademna) (Fig. 6). In some instances a rib- bon hangs from one end of the aluminum strip, giving the visual impression of a snake's tongue. The raffia fringe may be blackened or left its natural straw color. Although these elaborations were said to have symbolic significance, specific meanings could not be revealed to the author because of ritual prohibitions. However, polychromy utilizing the prin- cipal colors in Okpella "make it good (ti)," suggesting completeness in terms of the ramifications of ti, and the cloth appli- qu6 apron indicates a submerged link with the institution of titled elderhood (At- sogwa). The candidates undertaking both the preliminary (Otu) and final (Oghalo) rituals for the Atsogwa title wear similar aprons (obete) (Fig. 3), and Aminague masked spirits must dance at the funeral of a titled elder (A., May 1, 1973). Snake imagery appears in other contexts in Okpella as well: the python (inyokoko) symbolizes legitimate authority in art as- sociated with the ceremonies of titled elderhood (Borgatti, 1975), and the viper (oyemi) symbolizes power associated with the forces of night and the forest, provinces of the senior night society (Borgatti, 1976). Today, membership in the cult is achieved through the payment of fees to the association and completion of ritual tasks during the Aminague festival. It nor- mally is restricted to men, although some women (Ozu) hold limited membership through oracular pronouncement. Ac- cording to one western Okpella chief, his village holds a festival every second or third year to induct new members and create new masks (B., May 5, 1972). Here they seem linked to age sets, as are mas- querades in neighboring northwest Edo villages. In the largest western village, members entered the cult annually during a festival held to mark the end of the year (A. quoted in a letter from C., December 25, 1974). Although theoretically, a person of any age can join here, Aminague songs recorded in this village reveal ex- plicit associations with youth, aggression, and coming of age. An aspiring member's father pays his fees: a share of 200 tubers of yam, 28 naira ($42.00) to the associa- tion leaders, and 28 naira to the associa- tion for clearing the fourteen paths to the forest sanctuary (egua). But once a can- didate has completed his festival tasks, he may sing, "No one can beat me as he would a child (Ai gbe me na okha)," signifying his new adult status, and boast of his sanctioned aggressive behavior with the words, "The left-handed spirit-figure climbs a rock (Olimi ni o gobo, 0 nga ololo)." (In Okpella belief, the left hand is rough, uncontrollable, and merciless.) In a spatially separate quarter of this village, respondents stated that only certain kindreds or quarters had the right to par- ticipate in the cult. No citizen of the quarter owned an Aminague mask, and so, spirit-figures from a neighboring village were called when they were needed (May 10, 1972). Different kindreds, but only one in each of the two villages, sponsor Aminague in the two eastern Okpella vil- lages that utilize the cult. According to the chief in one of these villages, his kindred acquired the right to cult practices when his great grandfather purchased it from a western Okpella community prior to 1880 (the Nupe period) (D., May 6, 1972). Membership entitles a man to own and activate an Aminague masked spirit. Observation of Aminague outside the festival context suggests that only elder (in chronological age) cult members own them, while younger (and probably related) ones wear them. This is consistent with the behavior-associated with other Okpella masking traditions. Within the Olimi festival complex, for example, only persons of elder status may own mas- querades, and it is their personal power acquired through age and experience that protects the young performers who exist in a limbo between the living (agbo) and the dead (ilimi) while wearing the regalia. Any individual desiring to marshal supernatural forces to cope with a problem may petition an Aminague owner to activate the spirit-figure and the cult medicines on his behalf. The community as a whole may also call out Aminague in force when threatened by pestilence or disease. For example, during the recent outbreak of cholera in southern Nigeria, Aminague swept through one village, beating the houses and touching each vil- lage entrance to cleanse and fortify the community (E., May 10, 1972). In the past, during smallpox epidemics, Aminague were responsible for removing infected persons who would not leave the village voluntarily. As spirits, they were considered immune, and as an institution, they were immune, since any cult member could impersonate the spirit. Powerful, even more powerful than the senior night society according to some, so powerful that the cult's curse is no longer controllable (A. and C., May 1, 1973), Aminague may be the most ancient of Okpella's extant masking traditions. Although the cult is not well enough documented to compare it conclusively with Bini institutions, the visual symbol- the masquerade-has no prototypes in terms of documented Bini masks. The legacy of power, the variation of cult rules within Okpella, and its distribution-a clustering in western Okpella with some penetration into the eastern sector- suggest that Aminague was borrowed, al- beit early, and possibly derives from more than one source even in western Okpella. However, it should be noted that the term for the forest sanctuary associated with Aminague, egua, is cognate with the Bini term ogwa, which denotes the forest sanc- tuary associated with the Ovia mas- querades (Bradbury, 1973:203), a shrine room, or meeting room where sacrifices 26</page><page sequence="4">are made to ancestral spirits (Melzian, 1937:161-162). Similar images exist in Akoko-Edo in a number of northwest Edo village clusters-Atte, Ikpeshi, Oja, Erhurun- Uneme, Dagbala, and Akpama-Uneme (made in Dagbala)-and in the Yoruba- speaking town of Imeri (S.C. Picton, 1969; Borgatti, 1972), where they are explicitly linked to age-set title grades (Bradbury, 1970:118-119). Among the northwest Edo, however, two types of netted fiber mas- querade costumes are used within the same age-set ritual context. The alter- native to Aminague is also used in the northern Edo (Ivbiosakon) villages of Otuo (Fig. 5) and Ikao (Fig. 4) where they are definitely linked to elders' age-set promotions. If these two types, the Aminague and its alternative, can be con- sidered variations on a theme, the tradi- tion has a wider distribution than hitherto noted, and the relationship between the Okpella Aminague and the titled elders (It- sogwa) becomes less obscure.5 Okpella's Aminague also speak in the northwest Edo dialect of Oja-a reasonable indication of influence, if not origin, in terms of other Okpella masking traditions-and a belief persists in Okpel- la that Oja is a stopping point for Okpella souls on the way to the land of the dead (C., January 29, 1973), suggesting old and important links between them. In addi- tion, at Oja, according to Bradbury, the ti- tle grade that presents masked dancing is joined by members of an age set who pre- sent the village headman with 200 tubers of yam, as in Okpella (1970:118-119). A tradition of netted fiber masks also extends north and east of the confluence along the Benue with visual analogues of Okpella's Aminague photographed at Keana (Nzekwu, 1964:272), among the Geomai (Sieber, 1961:ill. 27) and the Montol (Ibid., ill. 8), although the images are not well documented as to function. In Okpella, however, the cult of Aminague is on the wane. The initiates can no longer completely control the forces associated with the cult, for a curse once invoked may rebound upon the head of the caller. The largest village in western Okpella, the stronghold of the cult, no longer holds an annual Aminague festival. Islam, Christianity, and the Olimi festival complex have usurped a significant proportion of the cult's membership, and the existing membership cannot sustain the expense. A festival is still held every seven years, or when there is sufficient "interest," to induct new members. Sharply contrasting with the powerful Aminague is the lively and entertaining Okakagbe, its name embodying the con- cept of something difficult skillfully executed-a reference both to perfor- mance and costuming. The Okakagbe ensemble (Fig. 8) consists of five or six anthropomorphic characters clad in bril- liant cloth applique, accompanied by a bush-beast costumed in assembled forest ~- , - -- 'AN. ,o 4.

The senior character, Odogu, or Ancient Mother, supports stuffed cloth children on her headdress (Cover) and dis- plays old, flat breasts-graphic evidence that she has suckled many children. An- cient Mother's mask is made of yellow cloth on which features are embroidered or appliqued. The broad brim of the head- dress and a collar of appliqued triangles frame the face. Below the "collar," the "shirt" displays an overall pattern of ap- pliqued six-pointed stars; the "trousers" have large triangular patterns defined by thin strips of appliqued cloth and filled with lines of couched thread embroidery. The costumes are white, red, yellow, and green against a background of black. A dancing child, dressed similarly, a yarn wig replacing the headdress, accompanies Ancient Mother. The second most important character and leader of the dance line is Otugo, a figure often costumed like Ancient Mother but whose brimmed headdress carries an intricate system of yarn-wound and tasseled hoops rather than "children." The remaining characters, another female and two males (the latter distinguished only by not having breasts), wear body costumes embellished with designs in couched thread embroidery and headdresses of loops and tassels, which rise directly from the mask structure rather than a brim.

The face, anthropomorphic but snaggle-toothed with a row of peccary tusks protruding from the mouth, is modeled in gum or beeswax over a basketry or wooden core. The body covering consists either of split seed pods sewn lapped onto a net suit- reminiscent of the scaled skin of the pangolin-or a suit of dried and bushy raffia. Both types are embellished with a ruff of porcupine quills. Idu, with his un- costumed young male keepers, parades around the village to alert people that a scheduled performance is about to begin. During the dance, the bush-beast func- tions as a crowd control mechanism, preventing the excited audience from encroaching on the dancers. The people of Okpella consider the Okakagbe dancers to be spirit-figures (ilimi) like the Aminague and other masked performers, although they are said to represent a particular category, bush spirits (Alijenu). However, characters' individual names are descrip- tive or refer to performance-to the character's place in the line of dancers, for the dancers enter the performance area in single file led by Otugo, with Ancient Mother last as is appropriate for a figure of importance. The dancers remain in a line, executing a complex pattern of stamps, leaps, and twirls, their movements synchronized. Ancient Mother and Child solo while the others rest, lending variety to the performance. Widely distributed in Okpella and sur- rounding northern Edo peoples, Okakagbe functions primarily in the social realm, appearing on any occasion when it is incumbent upon the host to provide entertainment. Okakagbe comes out to entertain the community at the end- of-the-year ceremonies in Avianwu (northern Edo) towns east of Okpella. In Okpella itself, the dancers' performance lends a dash of visual spice to the funeral and second burial ceremonies of impor- tant men and women and helps to es- tablish the deceased as a person of rank in the next world. Muslim communities oc- casionally hire Okakagbe dancers to entertain at important occasions, like the formation of the boys' age grade or the turbanning of a chief. Today, local government officials also act as patrons, calling upon the dancers to provide a "cultural display" for visiting dignitaries. No mystery surrounds the origin of this tradition among the northern Edo. Responsibility lies with an itinerant artist named Okeleke from Ibaji, the Ibo-Igala borderland east of the Niger.

THE DANCE LEADER IN WHITE CONGRATULATES THE OKPELLA ARTIST WHO HAS JUST COMPLETED THE COSTUMES, WHICH ARE BEING DANCED FOR THE FIRST TIME. around .1920, Okeleke made a set of costumes for a Weppa-Wano (northern Edo) community and taught them the as- sociated dance. So well pleased were the elders of the community that they gave Okeleke a wife, encouraging him to re- main in the area. The costumes succeeded spectacularly, replacing what people describe as rather drab homespun or "leaves and grass." (Photos taken by N. W. Thomas circa 1910 in this area do not reveal anything visually exciting and so may be taken to corroborate statements by respondents describing their earlier masquerade styles.) Community after community commissioned Okeleke to make costumes (Allison, 1961; Borgatti, 1972)-including Okpella. Okeleke returned to the east in 1966 when the civil war broke out,6-leaving behind him a legacy of beauty, for the northern Edo rationalize their changing masquerade styles on aesthetic grounds. To properly honor their ancestors, they are bound to use the newest and finest things available. The masking traditions of Ibaji have not been studied. However, a tradition of cloth applique extends eastward, doc- umented among the Nteje and Aguleri Ibo (Cole, 1970:ill. 65, 53), at Nsukka (Ibid., ill. 53), Abakaliki, and Onitsha (Nzekwu, 1960. pp. 192, 196-7). Idu also plays an im- portant role in northern Ibo masked plays, documented by Boston (1960), Cole (1970), and Henderson (1972). Boston also describes a performance mode for northern Ibo masquerades similar to that for Okakagbe. Al 9. IDU, THE MYTHICAL BUSH BEAST 29</page><page sequence="7">An elaboration of pre-existing customs, Olimi festival began around the turn of the century in the smallest eastern Okpella village, a result of exposure to masking traditions of neighboring peoples and the need to reaffirm ancestral connections at the end of a war-torn era. The festival grew and spread in an atmosphere of rivalry between eastern Okpella villages which competed by adding new mas- querades to the festival nucleus, the custom of offering food to the dead (akhilimi) accompanied by the perform- ance of the night society (Ilukpekpe). Today, Olimi is the culmination of a three-month period, the end-of-the-year (ukpeogbe). During this time, spiritual power to cope with vital problems is made available to the citizenry through the daily appearance of the festival heralds (Inogiri) who are the messengers of the Dead Fathers and servants of the night societies. On the eve of Olimi, the ritual activities of night masqueraders-the belled herald (Ogbanikaba), the senior night society (llukpekpe), and the junior night society (Iyabana)-purify the community, and on Olimi day, the return of ancestral spirits (ilimi) in the guise of masked per- formers-commemorative masquerades for men (omeshe or aja) and festival-titled women (ilimi izu), and the elders' mas- querade (Efofe)-celebrate their success: " ! -4( . l ........ 10. FESTIVAL HERALD (ANOGIRI) WEARING A CLOTH HOOD MASK. 11. ANOGIRI WEARING A WOODEN HELMET MASK the triumph of order over disorder, and the continuity of life. The Okpella consider the night society llukpekpe an institution brought from Benin. All nine Okpella villages have Ilukpekpe societies. A cognate institution with social control functions exists in North Ibie, a neighboring northern Edo group (F., May 24, 1972), and in Idua in northern Ishan (Thomas, ms., n.d., n.p.). However, as an association of "elder dead" with living counterparts among the village elders, Ilukpekpe resembles Igala and Ibo institutions to the east rather than documented Bini organizations to the south. In Okpella, Ilukpekpe maintains a forest sanctuary (okula) and the village Ogbedughulu ("power that kills quickly") shrine. It keeps an omeshe masquerade as its visual symbol and sponsors the elders' masquerade (Efofe), which climaxes the diurnal dance display of Olimi. Membership is theoretically secret, but all men (in the pre-Islamic, pre-Christian era) over the age of forty are members. In noc- turnal performances, darkness masks the dancers, and rhythms and sounds create character. The society is publicly represented by an omeshe masquerade-a cloth tube sewn at the bottom and gathered at the top around a wooden stem covered with cowry shells and sacrificial remains-called the Alukpekpe in this context (Fig. 7). Ilukpekpe singers introduce themselves with the enigmatic words, "I am Eguola, Aidenomo of Eguola, Eguola of Benin." Aidenomo is the name of a hero in Okpel- la tales, and Eguola is not the name of a Bini village, as was posited by one Okpella chief (D., May 8, 1973), but the name of 4%p an Igala non-royal clan (Boston, 1968:120). Furthermore, Ilukpekpe bears structural similarities to the Igala institu- tion Abule, a night society embodying the collective authority of the dead and hav- ing the corresponding power to curse in the name of the land, to purify the com- munity, and to exercise social control functions (Ibid., 155-6, 255). Significantly, the term Okula designating the forest sanctuary of Ilukpekpe is cognate with the Igala term an'okula, denoting the grove sanctuary for the ancestral shrine (Ibid., 130). Since the inception of the Olimi festival in Okpella, Ilukpekpe as collective dead have been linked with the individual deceased ancestors through the figure of the Alukpekpe, which may actually be the senior commemorative masquerade in the area governed by a night society. Concep- tually, this distinguishes the Okpella night society from that of the Igala, for the Igala collective dead embodied in Abule are clearly differentiated from individual deceased ancestors who are represented by staffs (okwute) or masquerades similar to omeshe (egu afia) (Boston, 1968:159). Thus llukpekpe echoes the northern Ibo elder dead, described by Henderson as an Igala-derived institution dating from the early eighteenth century-an inner coun- cil of the incarnate dead (ora-okwute) with fearful masked incarnations of elderly dead called egwugwu (omeshe- or egu afia- type masquerades) (1972:88)-an institu- tion in which the synthesis of collective and individual dead is also made. However Okpella acquired the institu- tion, it was sufficiently long ago to be validated by collective memory and incor- porated into the tradition of a Bini heritage. Nonetheless, the network of relationships it reflects extends eastward, and a precise determination of its relationship to other Edo institutions de- pends upon additional fieldwork. The use of the cloth tube omeshe and the synthesis of collective and individual dead, however, is traceable to the turn of the century in Okpella. The use of commemorative mas- querades began in the smallest eastern Okpella village, whose settlers must have included members of the senior night society but no one with access to the power of Aminague. According to respondents' accounts, these settlers had witnessed the masked plays of their North Ibie neighbors whose land they had shared during the Nupe period, and one man, Adoga of Imireke kindred, is credited with bringing the masquerades to the new settlement. This village dates the origin of the Olimi festival (Olimi signifies "shade" or "masked performer") to the reign of the chief presiding when the Europeans arrived in Okpella circa 1906. The second village to celebrate the festival dates Olimi to the reign of the chief who ruled from 1914 to 1952. Tradi- tion further indicates that the festival did not begin there until a group of people 30</page><page sequence="8">044J4 - rY '7 qlo- 7TI do. AW '.7 d . . . . . . . . . . . 12. OKPELLA IYABANA'S HUT from the first village moved into the vicinity of the second, circa 1920, after a dispute over succession. One man, Idogu of the same Imireke kindred as Adoga, traveled to Okene in the course of his work as an herbalist and "saw Igbira do- ing the same Olimi" as he had known. He reported what he had seen to the elders, who seized the opportunity to inaugurate a festival like the one they had par- ticipated in while living at their old site. Arrangements were made to learn the secrets of the Igbira festival masquerades, and so commemorative masquerades like omeshe (Ekuoba in Igbira) and their serv- ants Inogiri (Ekuegigi) appeared in the sec- ond village. (The festival then spread to two other Okpella villages, the third vil- lage acquiring the right from the first vil- lage, and the fourth from the second.) True to their Igbira heritage, Okpella's Inogiri speak only Igbira, although the Alukpekpe speaks Ibie-a reference to its formal derivation. Presumably, the belled herald Ogbanikaba with its counterpart in the Igbira Ekuahete (J. Picton, 1974:per- sonal communication) was introduced at the same time as the festival herald Anogiri. Once introduced, each festival character or mask type spread rapidly among the participating villages, and the relative sequence suggested here is in- ferred from the age of existing masks in villages, the manipulation of the symbolic content of the masks, and stated tradi- tions of origins collected in seven festival congregations. In Okpella, then, the cloth tube omeshe stems from two outside sources, the North Ibie, a northern Edo people, and the Igbira from Okene. The masquerade as a type, however, is widespread, its distribu- tion following the paths of the Niger and Benue rivers. Ekperi and Weppa-Wano peoples (northern Edo) living to the east of Okpella employ a similar masquerade, omese (dialect variant), which, although not commemorative, is the senior figure in their complex of masquerades (Borgatti, 1972). John Picton has documented the type to the north among the Igbira (NML report, n.d.) and to the east among the Igala of Dekina (NML 68.8.19 documen- tation); Nzekwu (1964) at Keana in the Benue Valley north of the confluence; R. G. Armstrong in Idoma (1972:personal communication); K. C. Murray in Ishan (NML 9.9.41); and Henderson among the northern Ibo (Onitsha) (1972:363). The Oyo Yoruba commemorative egungun described by Thompson (1974) and Adedeji (1970) may be seen as a westward extension of the tradition. Returning to the festival herald, Anogiri appears in his most awesome aspect wear- ing a three-quarter wooden helmet mask, a pajama suit of homespun, and ankle rat- tles made of many small tin bells (Figs. 2, 11). Although the formal realization varies somewhat, the mask is generally carved with an overhanging forehead, a recessed facial plane, an elongated and pronounced nose, and a small pursed and projecting mouth. Finally, it is blackened and decorated with red abrus seeds, cowry shells, and mirrors. Alternatively, Inogiri disport themselves wearing cloth hoods (Fig. 10) which allow them greater freedom of action during the whipping contests and general hell-raising of the week preceding Olimi. Picton has documented analogous cloth and wooden masked characters in Okene (1974:40), in- cluding an Ecane festival figure with the name Onogidi (simply a different transliteration of Anogiri), although he suggested in a personal communication that the style of Okpella's masks may owe something to eastern Igbira traditions (1974). Accruing to the festival is a second night society lyabana, prerequisite for Ilukpekpe where both, are found. It is reputed to have come to Okpella around the same time as Olimi, although it is more widely distributed than the festival and predates the festival in the last village to acquire the right to perform Olimi, the largest western Okpella village. Both night societies have powerful anti-witchcraft and social control functions-the junior society acting as the arm of the elders in bringing offenders to justice. The power of the senior night society is normally held in reserve for emergencies. Both societies perform within the context of Olimi festival to purify the community and re- mind the citizenry of social norms. Again, lyabana has no counterpart in Benin court or Bini village culture. Neither specific traditions nor linguistic clue points to its origin, for lyabana sings in an esoteric, composite dialect. Okpella, however, probably borrowed the institu- tion from its immediate northern Edo neighbors, the Uzairue. Uzairue main- tains a cognate institution which is central to traditional religious life and sings in Uzairue dialect. Weppa-Wano, a northern Edo people living to the east of Okpella, maintains a similar society (Ikwawa), and analogues are found among the northern Ibo. In Onitsha, these groups are known as Ayaka and Onyekulum (Henderson, 1972:352), and elsewhere as Ayaka, Abel- le, and Mgbado Obodo (Boston, 1960:61). Like Ilukpekpe, lyabana performers are masked by darkness and create character through rhythms and sounds. In order to participate in the diurnal dance displays of Olimi, however, lyabana developed its own visual symbol, an architectural mas- querade constructed of dried plantain leaves. Single fringes of plantain leaves (abunuku) protect the entrance to the in- ner sanctum of the forest sanctuary (Okula) as well as the nocturnal dancers. Multiple fringes create lyabana's Hut (lyabana okholo) (Fig. 12), which shelters numerous society members and shimmies and vibrates to internal drummed rhythms. Members of Uzairue's nocturnal lyabana wear analogous costumes, in- dividual cones of plantain leaves. Further- more, Okpella's lyabana music, although characterized by an Okpella signature rhythm, is not unrelated to Uzairue's (R. Witmer, 1974:personal communication). Two additional mask types were added to Olimi festival early in its history, the elders' masquerade Efofe and a mask commemorating festival-titled women. Ilukpekpe and the elders sponsor the Efofe, the character whose appearance marks the climax of the diurnal dance dis- play of Olimi. The village to first in- augurate Olimi festival also brought out the first Efofe, sometime after 1920, pos- sibly in an effort to regain superiority after its rival introduced the festival heralds to accompany its Dead Fathers (omeshe). The elders commisssioned Okeleke, the Ibaji artist resident in Weppa-Wano, to make something spectacular. He did-by combining the elements of the Okakagbe 31</page><page sequence="9">ensemble into a single figure, which the Okpella named Efofe or Uzuabino (Inside Front Cover). Efofe translates as "The more you look at it, the more you will have to look; you can never fully under- stand it, so you must continue to look at it." Uzuabino translates as "It rolls you over." An appropriate English colloquial equivalent is "Knock Out," which will be used henceforth. Knock Out's counterpart exists nowhere else among the northern Edo, although the forms are familiar from the Okakagbe ensemble common in the area and introduced by the same artist. Okeleke's response to the commisssion was inspired. The costume of cloth appli- qu6 with its swaying panels is elaborate and costly as befits the masquerade spon- sored by the elders. The configuration of figures on the headdress indicates seniority and power with its concomitant social responsibilities. The elders and Ilukpekpe look after the community with the diligence of a mother. The visual analogy between Knock Out and Ancient Mother (Okakagbe ensemble) is clear: An- cient Mother supports a similar group of "children" on her head and her old flat breasts signify the many children she has nourished. Knock Out has the face of Idu, the mythical bush-beast that accompanies Ancient Mother and her followers. As king of the forest, Idu is likewise an ap- propriate metaphor for the elders, "kings" of the village. (Paula Ben-Amos [1974] documents comparable use of animal metaphors in Bini plastic art.) The combination of mother and monster in a single image is both visually and socially dramatic. According to the "00 : 13, DEAD MOTHER (OLIMI OZU) people of Okpella, it is this combination of human and animal that renders the image at once captivating and in- comprehensible, unnatural and awe- some-hence its names. A positive metaphor, culture-in the form of head- dress, costume and panels of human manufacture-surrounds nature, the hor- rific face of Idu. The dangers of the bush- symbol of the unknown and unpre- dictable-have been subdued by civiliza- tion through the agency of the "elder dead" (Ilukpekpe) in which the power of the elders is concentrated and weighted with ancestral authority. Although Bini mythology explicitly ar- ticulates a "primordial antagonism" between man and animal, village and bush (Ben-Amos, 1974:2), Knock Out's form has its antecedents east of the Niger. Okeleke, from the Ibo-Igala borderland, might well have been familiar with the lineage tableaux of the Nteje Ibo (Cole, 1970:ill. 65) or even with Abakaliki's Zemma, king of spirits (Nzekwu, 1960:197)-both featuring cloth panels similar to Knock Out's and functioning as climactic artistic experiences in their respective cultures. The bead-embroidered panels of the Bamileke "elephant" masks, featuring triangular and rosette patterns, may represent a southeastern extension of the tradition dating from the turn of the cen- tury (Northern, 1975). Conceptually related too are the appliqu6 panels of the Yoruba egungun and gelede masked dancers to the west, although executed in leather and featuring more specific Islamic motives (Thompson, 1974). The last masquerade in chronological sequence is the Olimi commemorating deceased festival-titled women, Mothers of Spirits (Inyilimi or Ozu). A Dead Mother wears a white-faced, three-quarter helmet mask of wood (Figs. 13, 14), or a variant in cloth applique similar to that in an Okakagbe costume, and a pajama suit costume of imported trade cloth. Women own the masks, costume them, and ac- company them in the diurnal displays of Olimi when they are danced by young kinsmen. There is no tradition of origin associated with the masks. They are said to have come around the same time as Olimi itself. However, the oldest masks documented date from the 1930s and were carved by Weppa-Wano (northern Edo) carvers to the east of Okpella. These masks were documented in the second and third eastern Okpella villages to celebrate the festival, and one wonders whether the second village sought to upstage the first after the introduction of the elders' mas- querade Knock Out, or if the third village simply entered into the competition itself. Stylistically, the masks clearly relate to the white-faced "maiden spirit" masks used by the northern Ibo as well as other Ibo subgroups. Dead Mother masks are now carved by Okpella men, although none documented dated earlier than the mid- 1950s. The festival-title (Ozu) has a precedent in Okpella culture associated with the net- ted fiber Aminague masquerades, and a related institution (oniku) exists among the Igbira according to Okpella state- ments. However, Olimi festival-titled women achieve their status not only through oracular pronouncement but also by birth (during the two days of Olimi), or, more importantly, by economic means; and they are entitled to own and be commemorated by masks, which sharply distinguishes them from the Oza of Aminague. Although masks represent women in a general sense among the northern Ibo (Henderson, 1972:351), and female characters appear among Etsako masqueraders (Borgatti, 1972), the use of masks in commemorative ritual com- parable to that for men is specific to Okpella and to the Olimi festival. It relates to a complex of factors, most importantly the ability of Okpella women to amass significant amounts of capital through in- heritance and trade, aesthetic interest, and the desacralization of masquerades (weakening of taboos) borrowed from other peoples. In summary, the senior night society Ilukpekpe is found in all Okpella villages and is considered an "indigenous" institu- tion, brought from Benin according to the orthodox history. It forms part of the nucleus of Olimi festival, an aggregate of institutions and visual symbols which dates from the turn of the century, begin- ning in one eastern Okpella village, spreading rapidly to the other two eastern villages, but penetrating western Okpella only in the mid-1930s. The night society itself resembles Igala and northern Ibo societies rather than documented Bini in- stitutions, and the imagery associated with the Olimi festival reflects traditions found among other northern Edo living to the southeast of Okpella, the Igbira to the north, and the Igala and Ibo living east of the Niger. Okakagbe, the cloth appliqu6 tradition, was introduced into Okpella circa 1920 from the Ibo-Igala borderland. Both eastern and western Okpella villages own dance costumes and sponsor dance troupes that function in the social realm. Aminague, the netted fiber masquerade, the most ancient of Okpella's extant masking traditions, is associated primarily with western Okpella although it penetrated the eastern sector in the nineteenth century. The imagery of Aminague reflects the traditions of other northern Edo peoples living to the west of Okpella and, in particular, neighboring northwest Edo village clusters. These images and reflections raise questions about the nature of masking in Bini culture, about the ability of ritual institu- tions to weather catastrophe (the Nupe in- vasions of the nineteenth century) assum- ing the Okpella "brought" institutions from Benin, and about the ethnic make- up and orthodox history of the Okpella people. c Notes, page 90 32 14, DEAD MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY OWNER-CUSTODIAN</page><page sequence="10">N W, 4 ............i . .. .

Field research was carried out in Nigeria from 1971 to 1974 under the auspices of the Nigerian Federal Department of Antiquities and partially funded by the following grants: Museum of Cultural History, Ralph Altman Award; Regents of the University of Califor- nia, Patent Fund; NDEA Title VI awards. 2. Because of the unreliability of the 1963 and 1974 census data, the 1952 figures were compounded at the standard rate of 2.5 percent per year to arrive at an ap- proximate figure. 3. In cooperation with the Nigerian Federal Depart- ment of Antiquities, place names and individuals' names have not been included in hopes that this will spare individuals from harassment and that the publication of this article will not endanger the Okpel- la people's cultural heritage. 4. Compare: Osanabua, the Bini supreme deity (Brad- bury, 1970: 52), and Ihinegba, the Igbira supreme deity (Brown, 1970Y 70). 5. The fiber masquerades of Otuo and Ikao are dis- played on posts in the forest sanctuary during the festival period in a manner similar to that described for Ovia costumes in Bini villages-providing another tenuous link with Benin. Until more research is car- ried out in Otuo, it is impossible to determine whether or not the fiber tradition belonged to autochthones and was adapted to Edo use patterns, or if the fiber tradition reflects early Bini practices. 6. No one had heard from Okeleke since 1966, and it was presumed that he had died in his homeland, for he was an old man by the time he left northern Edo country. OKPELLA, Bibliography Adedeji, J. 1970.
