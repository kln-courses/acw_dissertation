<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEINBRING, J., WATCHMAN, A., FAULSTICH, P. &amp; TALON, P.S.C. (eds) 1993. Time and Space: dating and spatial considerations in rock art research. Melbourne: Australian Rock Art Research Asso- ciation occasional publication No. 8. ISBN 0 646 15617 9. Order from: The Editor, AURA, PO Box 216, Caulfield South, Vic. 3162 Australia. Time and Space comprises selected papers presented at the second AURA Congress held in Cairns in 1992. Although only one paper (Loubser) deals directly with South African art, the papers raise ideas, issues and problems of interest to all rock art researchers. The volume brings together the proceedings of two symposia from the Cairns meeting and is accordingly organised into two sections. The first deals with that most frustrating of problems, the dating of rock art. Four of the eight papers in this section present solidly archaeological approaches to the dating challenge, in North America, Australia and France. Carlson outlines an attempt to derive a chronology by comparing the style of mobiliary art from dated archaeological contexts on the North American northwest coast with petroglyphs from the same area. Stylistic and iconographic 'matches' suggest a tentative chronology for certain motifs. Welch, in Australia, works towards developing a chronology via a range of methods. Weathering, the formation of silica skins over paintings, spatial arrangement and content are discussed. Both these papers describe approaches to dating the art which are area specific and are, unfortunately, not applicable to the South African art. The potential for dating rock art in Queensland, Australia, as outlined by Campbell and Mardaga- Campbell may have relevance for South African rock art research in certain instances. They attempt to conjoin Watchman's technique of 'nanostratigraphic excavation' of crusts on the cave wall and the results of 'microstratigraphic' excavation of floor deposits, with a special focus on hearths. They suggest that carbon from hearths situated in close proximity to paintings might adhere to the cave wall and ultimately be correlated with dated hearths. It is also anticipated that correlations with dated volcanic activity in the area might be established. For the South African context, dating of the art by means of excavation of associated deposits is a basic, but useful and uncomplicated method; this article highlights the potential for error in the method, while suggesting ways to obviate the problems. Three papers deal with the direct dating of rock art. Watchman and Lessard describe a new technique [FLECS- AMS] which promises to extend the method which Watchman has so determinedly developed, of dating organic matter in rock surface accretions. The technique of using laser-induced oxidation in situ may prove to be a suitable method of extracting carbon for AMS '4C dating, since it potentially reduces contamination problems. Chaffee, Hyman and Rowe also report on a specialised technique for extracting organic carbon in such a way as to minimise contamination. A low(-er) tech alternative for dating - specifically micro-erosion - is suggested by Bednarik. His recommendation rests on a socioeconomic premise: that this simple method is particularly suitable for "researchers in developing or former socialist countries" (1993:64). Otherwise, he predicts an undesirable scenario where the technology of rock art dating develops into "a monopoly of a few Western countries" (1993:66). Whether or not Bednarik's suggestions are ultimately accepted, the attention to the political implications of scientific technology in archaeology is unusual and important. Clottes and Courtin also locate their subject matter - the dating of the partly submerged Cosquer Cave, near Marseilles - in relation to broader issues, specifically that of archaeological reasoning. Apart from reporting the results of initial '4C dating, the authors discuss the question of authenticity, which has arisen several times in relation to Palaeolithic art sites. They discuss "The various ways used to test the genuineness of the art, the arguments put forth for or against it, and the assumptions on which they rest" (1993:22). Rather than sailing the high seas of archaeometric dating, Chippindale and Tagon return to an older technique - study of superimpositioning. Of particular interest is their use of Harris matrices to resolve the complicated sequences of two painted sites in Arnhemland. As the authors note, this approach is "very much slower and more laborious than is customary...To impose these methods as routine is impractical. But they are valuable and even necessary for a certain number of key sites...which may resolve an important research question" (1993:39). In this instance, the detailed study largely supports a pre-existing typology of 'styles', and confirms "a significant variability which carries chronological meaning" (1993:39). A highlight of the paper for this reader was the associated discussion of recording techniques, and the case presented for recording by means of pencil redrawings, rather than ink. The writers propose that this "...'soft' record is an essential means to show readers what we have seen, as a necessary stage between the obscurity of an uninterrupted photograph and the misleading clarity of a hard drawing" (1993:35). This may be of interest to South African researchers, whose traditional allegiance has been to the "hard drawing". South African rock art researchers are accustomed to frustration and even despair over the dating problem. Though the papers discussed above offer no quick fixes, they offer some hope for future breakthroughs. The second half of the volume is devoted to spatial considerations, including distributions of paintings, symbolic landscapes and related concerns. McDonald, working in Southern Australia, considers a number of engraving sites in relation to a prominent topographical landmark, Mount Yengo. On the basis of paintings and excavations, she suggests that the presence of Mount Yengo has influenced the "presence and nature of art sites in the surrounding landscape" ( 1993:84). Through information derived from excavation and examination of</page><page sequence="2">46 South African Archaeological Bulletin the diversity of the sites in the area, McDonald introduces issues of change through time, and the role of the art in the 'social cycle', relative to inter-group affiliations. Also in Australia, Huchet focusses on the spatial distribution of anthropomorphic figures, particularly those interpreted as 'culture heroes'. Certain categories of anthropomorphs seem to indicate the existence of special function sites. By plotting the distributions of anthropomorphic figures, Huchet identifies 'core locations' where frequencies are high, with numbers decreasing as one moves away from the central area. This allows him to identify art regions which, he postulates, may be correlated with discrete social units. Loubser's paper focusses on questions of authorship of sheep and cattle paintings in the context of interactions between San hunter-gatherers and Sotho-Tswana agriculturists. The distribution of these paintings in areas not settled by Sotho-Tswana peoples reinforces the idea that some of these paintings were indeed executed by San peoples. Loubser draws a distinction between 'blocked' and shaded paintings of domestic animals, suggesting that the former are younger than the latter. His focus on pigment differences and stylistic variation is a valuable attempt to go beyond simple iconographic analysis. A re-evaluation of the controversial practice of ethnographic analogy is the basis of Stone and Bahn's comparison of Mayan and Franco-Cantabrian rock art sites, both of which are located in deep caves. Their study shows certain similarities in spatial usage (although this might be expected, given that such caves offer a similar suite of choices). The authors suggest that, despite the geographical and chronological separation of the sites in question, such analogies offer the- best and perhaps the only way of understanding Palaeolithic art. As such, they offer an interesting perspective on the changing status of analogical methods in rock art research. Hedges' paper focusses on the association of rock art and gong rocks in three regions of America. His analysis of this relation highlights the proposition that the production of rock art should be seen "as an activity in itself", linked to indigenous perceptions of the supernatural significance of certain landscape features. At one of the sites discussed, the making of petroglyphs would have caused the rock to ring; this focusses attention on the significance of the manufacturing process and the interaction with the rock face, rather than on iconography. Time and Space is a useful compilation of new approaches in rock art research, invoking a range of issues which go beyond simple questions of chronology and distribution.
