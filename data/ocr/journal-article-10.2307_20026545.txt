<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIGFRIED GIEDION The Roots of Symbolic Expression There are signs today that we are again approaching an age of symbolism, and that a prolonged phase of naturalism is giving way to new conceptions of reality, one of multiple dimensions and renewed significances. The present revival of interest in the symbol and its meaning leads us back to its origins in pre history. It is there that the whole process of symbolization can best be studied. Indeed, symbolization is the key to all paleo lithic art, from the grandiose engravings and paintings in the caverns of southern France and Spain to small artifacts made from reindeer antlers. In every case actuality has been trans lated into symbolism, however realistic it may appear. This transmutation persisted throughout paleolithic art until the neolithic period, when abstraction reigned supreme. It is only in recent years that scholarship has recognized the importance of a systematic study of the symbolic content of prehistoric art. The further we proceed in such investigations, the more we are astonished at the amazing richness of imagina tion displayed. Here, it seems, may be the sources of much of the imagery which has been attributed to Greek art. However, the previous work of all serious prehistorians and anthropolo gists has concentrated on the classification of material objects such as hand axes and other such tools. Consequently there still exist great gaps in our understanding of what symbol meant to prehistoric man. Today the common denominator in creed and ritual that once linked man to man has lost its force. Whereas in primitive eras magic, myth, and religion provided man with a spiritual armor against a hostile environment, today he stands stripped and naked. In the effort to compensate he has had to create symbols and inner images out of himself. Half-ironically, the surrealist painter Max Ernst wrote, "In 1930, after having composed with violence and method the Femme 100 t?tes, I was visited nearly every day by my private phantom attached to my person?the superior of birds named Loplop."1 Today the average man appears to have lost the key to his own being, even though he still believes that he knows what he 24</page><page sequence="2">GIEDION: The Roots of Symbolic Expression likes and that he can express what he feels. The ruling taste of the times demonstrates the result of this loss, for it affects the entire sphere of emotional activity. The average man, whether governed or governing, has grown indifferent to the flood of surrogates, to ersatz in art and architecture, to falsity in ex pression; and this process has been called "the devaluation of symbols."2 For a century and a half it has been apparent, and it is still going on. The decline in our community life, our helplessness in finding forms for celebration or leisure, our lack of imaginative power to develop forms to counteract the maladies of our culture?all indicate the extent of man's present disorientation. It is not difficult to understand how this has come about. The man of today has to bear an enormous and increasing load of intellectual knowledge, while at the same time his emotional world has been steadily atrophying. His emotional apparatus has shrunk to a mere appendage, quite unable to absorb and humanize the knowledge accumulated by his brain. He stands alone. It may be that from new developments in the communal sphere some new suprapersonal spirit will emerge. But at the moment, man must rely on himself. This situation may give us a clue to the nature of those symbols which are today emerging in the work of contemporary painters and poets. The Reawakening of Symbols Jean-Paul Sartre (however his existentialism is regarded) is a poet with visions of what kinds of symbols are possible today. In L'Imaginaire he asserts that, in contrast to the situation in former periods, symbolic function is no longer derived and explained from the outside world. "We would not accept a conception according to which the symbolic function has to be added to the image from outside. The image is in essence symbolic by its very structure."3 Without any kind of inter mediary, the symbol through its very form finds a direct access to the emotions. Forms that have no apparent significance and yet seize di rectly upon the senses are the dominant constituent elements of "contemporary art." These symbols differ not only from the magical potent symbols of prehistory but also from the conceptualized symbols of the Greeks. Today's symbols are anonymous; they seem to exist for themselves alone, without any direct significance. Yet they are imbued with an inexplicable attraction: the magic of their forms. In a sense, they represent a regenerative or healing process, a flight from technological frenzy. Beside these anonymous symbols or forms without direct significance, age-old symbols from the remote past have 25</page><page sequence="3">been revived and integrated into new contexts, as is discerned in the work of Joan Mir? and Paul Klee, among others. It would be a rewarding though difficult task to carry out some form of research which could give us an insight into the process of this development and its manifold ramifications. It cannot be said today that the forces of symbolization no longer exist. A great picture that seizes all our senses simulta neously ( as does Picasso's "Guernica" ) can become a great com posite symbol. As we become aware of the multilayered fabric of the soul, we try to ascertain not only the limits within which logical argument operates as a reliable tool, but also the areas in which that tool cannot be used, areas of different psychic dimensions. The laws of logic have colored philosophic thought ever since the Renaissance, especially since the seven teenth century. This influence is closely paralleled in the optical sphere by the influence of perspective on our view of the world. It is just these narrow criteria of logical cause and effect and of optical perspective that the present period resents and rebels against. One no longer has to ask why. Our eyes are not blinded to the marvelous artistic achievements of recent centuries; but we have become ever more conscious of the situation to which rationalism led us throughout the nineteenth century: that of riving only for the moment, lacking all certainty regarding decisions that take on psychic dimensions. The one-way street of logic has landed us in the slum of materialism. The Symbol in Primeval Art Before art, man created the symbol. The name arose late? the symbol, early. It appears at the very dawn of man's urge for expression. Its first rudimentary form emerged in the Mouste rian era as the traces of Neanderthal man's first attempts at a spiritual organization transcending simple materials and a utilitarian existence. Bones engraved with parallel and diagonal lines or with red circles have been found, but these are so fragmentary that no safe conclusions can be drawn from them. It is quite otherwise, however, with the small hemispherical hollows carved out of stone, called cupules. Prehistorians report that the earliest surviving man-made signs were found on a tri angular grave slab discovered in the rock shelter of La Ferrassie in the Dordogne. These were small hollows in the slab, which was placed face down over a child's body. These hollows, which had no practical function, are a widespread phenomenon of paleolithic art whose symbolic significance is undefined. The magic symbols that appear most frequently and over the longest periods of prehistory are simple. They consist of 26</page><page sequence="4">giedion: The Roots of Symbolic Expression fragments, the part standing for the whole: a hand, for example, represents the entire human being, and the genitalia repre sent fertility. But it is more difficult to give meaning to the circle. It appears in a great number of forms, large and small? as cup-shaped depressions in stone (cupules), colored dots and disks (ponctuations), holes (perforations), often varying in shape. In primitive times symbols sometimes stood alone, though usually several were associated and interrelated, e.g., dots were related to hands, animals, or tectiforms, and cupules were arranged in rows or placed singly in association with an animal or upon the animal. Greater precision could thus be given to certain of the manifold meanings inherent in any one symbol, and also a single overriding meaning could be accentuated, such as the desire for increased fertility. Such designs, in which different symbols with many meanings were combined in order to stress one specific meaning?as genitalia and cupules?may be called "composite symbols." In addition to simple straightforward symbols, a host of complex and entirely abstract forms were developed in prim itive times. Man's power in this direction seems to have been inexhaustible, but the meanings are all the more obscure. The names given these more complex symbolic forms are mere labels ?tectiforms, claviforms, naviforms. In contrast to the simpler symbols, individual imagination here seems to have been given free play, and in many cases only a single example of certain types is as yet known. These symbols are usually in the most inaccessible parts of the caverns, as at Altamira, El Castillo, and La Pasiega. The fact of their inaccessibility may be interpreted as referring to the special potency of the magic emanating from them. Even today many of these configurations exert a strangely powerful impression on the beholder, as in Altamira, where blood-red zigzag symbols as large as the drawings of the bulls traverse the whole ceiling. Symbolization arises from the need to give perceptible form to the imperceptible. Symbolization emerged as soon as man felt the need of expressing the disquieting and intangible rela tion between life and death, first expressed in very primitive ways. When Johann Jakob Bachofen said that it was in the tomb that the symbol was formed, he was thinking of the Etruscan necropolis that was the starting point for his pioneer researches on symbolism.4 His supporting material was pro vided by tomb reliefs, long ignored by the archaeologists, and by his profound knowledge of classical authors. Since then, both material evidence and our understanding of symbolism have increased enormously, and our newly acquired knowledge of primitive art has largely sustained Bachofen's theories. 27</page><page sequence="5">Symbol and Existence Let us repeat: the symbols of primitive art are rooted in the primary demands of human existence, in the idea of the con tinuity of life and death. The main purpose of primitive exist ence was to obtain food. Food implied the animal. Where direct attack on the animal was not successful, rituals, magic signs, and magic symbols were invented, by which man hoped to be invested with power to bewitch the animal. But the killing of beasts was not enough to ensure a continuous food supply. That depended also on the fecundity of the stock; to ensure this, primitive man was even more powerless. Only magic held out hope. We can therefore understand that most early symbols, though they appear in highly varied, even opposing, combinations, were concerned with the perpetuation of the animal species, and in one way or another were designed to promote fertility through magic. We see this more clearly in the primitive Aurignacian than in the later and more highly developed Mag dalenian era. In the former, one symbol of fertility is the vulva; it appears constantly, generally alone, but sometimes in com bination with the animal whose increase is desired. Such repre sentations of female organs have certainly nothing to do with human sexual instincts, nor do the much rarer representations of male organs, or the small female figurines with enormous breasts and abdomens, or the ithyphallic male figures. This can be substantiated, of course, only by many comparative illus trations. Signs of a belief in the continuance of life after death ap peared in the early Mousterian age. Things come to no abrupt end, and death does not completely extinguish life. Some possibility of re-entering the earthly cycle emerges, both for men and for animals?though how this is to be achieved is very unclear. In that age man lived close to his dead, who were buried within his dwelling place. Tens of thousands of years later the same custom was practiced in the Nile Delta (Merimde), just before the dawn of history. The dead influ enced the fate of their descendants, they shared in the family meals. Today in parts of Polynesia it is customary to bury the dead within the dwelling or outside beneath the eaves. This area is otherwise sacrosanct. "People do not turn their backs on it, and when they lie down to sleep they orient their heads in that direction."5 The animal, too, possessed magic power after death. Both in the interests of the food supply and also to placate the spirit of the dead animal, it was reasonable to take steps to facilitate its return to life. "In short, everything was done as though the 28</page><page sequence="6">gbedion: The Roots of Symbolic Expression animal had magic powers at its command which must be pro pitiated or dominated by other magic forces."6 Symbol and Myth Premythological man was completely embedded in the world which surrounded him. He formed one with it, he did not stand above it, he did not feel himself to be the center, but a humble element in it. His fate was ruled by powers he could not com prehend. To him the animal was a superior being, a creature greater than he, and at the same time a personification of invisible powers. All primitive symbols are rooted in this zoomorphic age. However simple or complex these symbols, they all represent invisible forces in a universe not yet reduced to a battleground between man and man. Myths, on the other hand, are based on the relationships and destinies of men, or of men and gods. In myths, time (the suc cession of events ) plays a determining part. In primeval times, today, yesterday, tomorrow all were one. Myths grew out of the huge transformation from the zoomorphic to the anthropo morphic age in which we still live, and thus they arose rela tively late. It would be hazardous to assign any precise dates; yet from their content, the conflicts they embody, and the con text in which they are described, we may assume that they roughly coincided with the first formal communities, such as the small temple settlements that flourished both in the north and south of Mesopotamia in the fourth millennium b.c. In the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh, the cities had already become the acknowledged centers of religion and authority, and Gilgamesh the epic hero ruled the city of Erech. According to the evidence, Gilgamesh did not live before 2700 or 2600 b.c. Therefore, the epic recording his heroic deeds can date from no earlier than about 2600 b.c. In this period a new world of gods, whose hierarchical structure precisely reflected the contempo rary social order, came into being. If we consider the situation immediately before this, as reflected in Persian and Mesopotamian pottery of the fifth mil lennium b.c., we find no trace of myth and the world of the gods, such as appears on the cylinder seals of the late fourth millennium. The abstract designs on the earlier pottery, with their artistic intensity and great charm, are rich in prehistoric concepts, and they have far more in common with the symbolic world of the Magdalenian era (eight to ten millennia earlier) than with the anthropomorphic myths of a thousand years later. Yet it must not be forgotten that vestiges of prehistory still cling to the anthropomorphic myths. Like the signs and symbols in the primitive world, they indicate the eternal polarity of life 29</page><page sequence="7">and death, and are embedded in the cosmos. Now all has been given anthropomorphic form, and the stars themselves have become deistic personifications. This mingling of men and gods with the cosmos is the prime characteristic of myths. The Symbol as a Concept It was the Greek way of thought that gave rise to the con ceptual form of the symbol. The word "symbol" (itself of Greek origin) was absorbed into the most diverse languages, includ ing Latin, although the Romans had no love for the concept it represented. The variety of meanings the concept of the symbol had for the Greeks of the classical period arises from the fact that they formed three different nouns from the original verb. Its complicated linguistic relations were set down as early as 1810 to 1812 by Friedrich Creuzer. The original Greek word symbalon signified the adjustment of various parts to form a whole, and its three variant meanings were "to unite; to con nect; to bring separate parts together." The simplest meaning of symbalon, therefore, is that used by Plato, "one composed of two." The best-known example of the Greek use of the symbol is a host's gift of part of a broken coin or ring to a departing guest, while he himself retained the corresponding part, so that when these halves were later matched, the owners or their descendants could recognize one another. The symbol became a token of relationship which had been given a special significance. Viewed objectively, no connection existed between the fragment of the broken coin and the meaning it had been given, nor was any clue perceptible to the senses?it eluded them. The symbol reassumed its supraper sonal significance and recovered its original role as the image of something that could not be directly expressed. Schlesinger quotes this passage from Bachofen's Gr?ber Symbolik: "Words confine infinity. Symbols guide the spirit, beyond the powers of the finite state of becoming, into the realm of the infinite world of existence."7 Thus the symbol recovers its primitive significance: it is nameless, yet it is a powerful reality, and it is this consistent meaning that is again operative today. Today we are no longer satisfied with mere facts and philo logical exactitudes. We demand more, but we are confronted by lacunae or by the work of dilettantes whose knowledge of the source materials cannot be trusted. By its very conception, the scholarship of the last hundred years was impelled to condemn all attempts in this direction and reject its advocates. This is thoroughly understandable, as archeological methods have been modeled on the methods of the dominating natural sciences. Unfortunately, despite all desire for precision, the use of purely 30</page><page sequence="8">GIEDION: The Roots of Symbolic Expression rational methods is not possible in the historical sphere, espe cially in prehistory and protohistory. Today, when the question of the inner meaning of phenomena has slowly come to the fore and history is much more identified with human destiny than treated as a sequence of events, we lack the necessary source material: a background of scholarly investigation of the meaning of symbols. Only two outstanding figures since Giambattista Vico ( 1668-1744) have devoted their lives to the investigation of symbols, one at the beginning and one at the middle of the nineteenth century. Friedrich Creuzer's great work, Symbolik und Mythologie der alten V?lker, besonders der Griechen ( Symbols and Myths of the Ancients, especially the Greeks: 1810) originated in Heidel berg out of the atmosphere created by early Romantic poets such as Novalis, Arnim, and Tieck, by philosophers such as Schelling, and by scholars of various fields. Like Vico, Creuzer (1771-1858) considered language the most faithful recorder of the early periods. He developed the Greek ideas of the symbol and recognized that the symbol "encompasses the whole in an instant." From this he derived a new conception of symbol, "which we express in words as Immediate perception': momen tane Anschaulichkeit'9 Creuzer comes very near to Johann Jakob Bachofen when he remarks, "The symbol wants to say much, and it should express the divine. ... In a flash the idea springs from the symbol and seizes all the senses. It is a ray direct from the depths of being and thinking, it transfixes our eyes and permeates our entire nature with an immediate perception." Bachofen (1815-1887) surpasses all others who attempted a serious investigation of symbols during the last century by rea son of his profundity and his loneliness. In his era there was no recognition of him as the discoverer of primeval religion and of matrilinear descent (Das Mutterrecht, 1861), and as the revealer of the forgotten influence on the human psyche of myths, language, and symbols. Neither archeologists nor eth nologists nor social anthropologists were concerned with such researches. Since Freud, however, the psychoanalysts have taken up the problem, and have influenced other disciplines, though often without the necessary knowledge. Very recently certain French prehistorians have endeavored to unravel the significance of prehistoric symbols through statistical com parsions. Even so, we are only at the very beginning of such understanding. The Potent Symbol The golden age of the symbol was in prehistoric times. "Since then it has been overwhelmed by the hostile pressure of rational 31</page><page sequence="9">thought, which, reinforced by experience and reason itself, has steadily gained ground. ... The raison d'?tre of the symbol lies in the human urge to express that which is inherently inex pressible."8 The essential nature of the symbol has always consisted in this urge to express the inherently inexpressible, but in prim itive times the crystallization of a concept in the form of a symbol portrayed reality before that reality came to pass, wish, the prayer, or the spell to be fulfilled. The symbol itself was reality, for it was believed to possess the power of working magic, and thus of directly affecting the course of events. The symbol portrayed reality before that reality came to pass. Herein lies the contrast between the function of the symbol in prehistory and in later periods. In Greece the symbol was not only a means of recognition, it also developed a spiritual content and became an abstract concept. It was not an inde pendent agent. Bachofen calls the kinds of symbols found on Roman mortuary reliefs "reposing in themselves"?that is, complete in themselves. The symbols employed in the Christian catacombs up to the middle of the fifth century a.d. embodied the hope of future bliss: wine signified the feasts of Paradise; a dove sipping water, the soul refreshing itself in the waters of life; flowered meadows represented Heaven itself. These all point to the life beyond the tomb and are transcendental, whereas primitive symbols were neither complete in themselves nor transcen dental. It is difficult to determine the limits of symbolism in pre history. It was believed to be a potent agent, and by force of sympathetic magic was called upon to help achieve a certain purpose, with positive results. Yet the border line between the symbol and other representations is indeterminate, as in the spellbinding forms of animals on cavern walls, with their inex tricable mingling of magical intent and straightforward realism. We are again approaching an age of symbolism. No one will deny the laws of logic; they are as valid today as yesterday. Yet we are compelled to ask: does everything come under the sway of logical reasoning? Are there not many aspects of human experience to which the cause-and-effect reasonings of logic are not applicable? In considering history?even the fife history of the simplest creature?we cannot help but observe how most actions evade a clear explanation in terms of cause and effect. We can always discover certain causes after the event, but we are unable to predict a future effect of a cause, or the development of which we ourselves are a part and with which our personal destiny is unremittingly involved. Once again we begin to recognize the wisdom of bygone 32</page><page sequence="10">GIEDION: The Roots of Symbolic Expression periods, when so much less was known but when the world was conceived as free and untrammeled, not caged within the bounds of logical cause and effect.
