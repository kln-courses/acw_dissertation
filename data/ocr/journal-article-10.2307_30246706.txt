Broadway Road Tempe, Arizona 85282 ABSTRACT Investigations into the rock art of Lake Pleasant Regional Park reveal extensive temporal use of the park through stylistic variation. Element frequencies indi- cate that Archaic, Hohokam, Patayan, and Historic Yavapai peoples produced a diverse range of petroglyphs along the Middle Agua Fria River. Locational analysis reveals that some panel aspects were preferred for certain element types and that the location of rock art within a site is nonrandom and tied to surrounding characteristics of the landscape. RESUMEN Investigaciones de petroglificos en el Parque Regional de Lake Pleasant revelaron variaciones en estilo indicativas de uso extenso del Parque sobre un largo tiempo. Frequencias de elementos estilisticos indican que grupos de afiliacidn prehist6rica (Archaic, Hohokam, Patayan) e hist6rica (Yavapai) producieron diversos tipos de petroglificos a lo largo del Rio Agua Fria Medio. Andlisis de las localidades de estos petroglificos revela que algunos aspectos de los paneles eran preferidos para ciertos tipos de elementos, y que el lugar donde se encuentran petroglificos en un sitio arqueol6gico es especifico, y relacionado a las caracteristicas del ambiente natural. Over the last two decades, interest in prehistoric rock art has increased significantly. Recent studies frequently have focused on the definition of style by examining differences in element frequencies within, between, and among cultural regions. In one of the earliest studies along these lines, Heizer and Baumhoff (1962:72) pointed out that one of the biggest problems in conducting petroglyph research is the difficulty in identifying culturally meaningful units of measure- ment. The underlying issue is the inability of Western society to view rock art symbols from an emic standpoint. Nevertheless, one must begin by attempting to identify what was meaningful to prehistoric groups by looking for patterns in the types, combinations, and distributions of the symbols they used. Some researchers have pointed out that without a complete data set for any given region, this kind of frequency tabulation falls short of providing adequate information to establish patterns of inter- and intra-regional variation (Bostwick and Krocek 2002; Thiel 1995). Such frequencies however provide a baseline from</page><page sequence="2">186 MORENO which to describe individual sets of data. Detailed descriptions at this level will be necessary until sufficiently large bodies of data have been compiled for the various cultural regions in the Southwest to characterize their internal variation. At that point, archaeologists can turn their attention from what is different about each data set to what is similar about them. It can also be argued that focusing on every variation of a single element type may be akin to trying to analyze handwriting. This form of "overdissection" serves to create disparity, masking any commonality that might shed substantial insight into the function and interpretation of rock art. It would be advantageous to begin viewing elements in the context of the panel rather than in isolation. Bruder's (1983) work at Hedgepeth Hills north of Phoenix represents the only attempt to statistically analyze recurring combinations of element types. She determined that element distribution within the site was nonrandom and con- cluded that such combinations were a form of communication. Ongoing petroglyph research in the Phoenix South Mountains also treats rock symbols as a protowriting (Bostwick and Krocek 2002). The approach taken here is that all symbols are potentially meaningful. Thus, terms such as "nonrepresentational" are avoided in element descriptions. The purpose of this study is to provide descriptions of the rock art along the Middle Agua Fria River in Lake Pleasant Regional Park (LPRP), near Phoenix, Arizona (Fig. 1), and to place them in cultural and topographic context. The database includes 87 petroglyph stations (equivalent to one boulder regardless of the number of panels) with a total of 114 panels and 401 elements distributed among 19 sites. These tasks are first accomplished by providing element type frequencies for all of the petroglyphs and then subdividing the data based on style and time period. Next, a sample of petroglyph sites from the area immediately north of LPRP, else- where in the Hohokam northern periphery, the Salt-Gila Basin, the Tucson Basin, and northern Arizona are compared to the Lake Pleasant assemblage. Finally, the sites' topographic settings and their relationships to the petroglyphs and to panel orientation are examined in a locational analysis. PROJECT BACKGROUND In 1993, the completion of New Waddell Dam, increasing recreational develop- ment, and new park boundaries spurred the Bureau of Reclamation, Phoenix Area Office (Reclamation), to perform an intensive cultural resources survey of LPRP. The survey area encompassed 6,075 ha (15,000 acres) between the high water mark at 519 m (1,702 feet) above sea level and the 1995 park boundary. Reclama- tion archaeologists identified 183 historic and prehistoric sites (104 previously known; 79 newly identified) and 306 isolated artifacts (Moreno et al. 2001). In addition, Reclamation cultural resources staff recorded each petroglyph panel and element found at 19 of the sites in detail, which form the basis of this study.</page><page sequence="3">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 187 River ANASAZI A R Z N A PATAYAN Study Area Lake Pleasant Regional Park - ( Salt RiverSu - alt-Gila Basin HOHOKAM Ri&amp;ver MOGOLLON Tucson Basin 0 20 40 60 80 100 Kilometers 0 20 40 60 Miles F __ Figure 1. Study area. Lake Pleasant is in the Transition zone between the southern Basin-and-Range deserts and the Colorado Plateau. It is an area known as the Central Highlands and referred to in this paper as the Middle Agua Fria River. The river is an intermittent drainage that flows south as it collects runoff from the Black Mountain Range to the north, from the Bradshaw Mountains to the west, and from the New River Mountains to the east. Culturally, this area typically is referred to as the Hohokam northern periphery (Green 1989a, 1989b). Some researchers recently have argued that the core-periphery model, originally used to discuss economics in Europe, does not apply well to prehistoric cultural groups in central Arizona (Stone 2000). Further, the cultural origins of Wingfield Plain, generally considered a Hohokam</page><page sequence="4">188 MORENO ceramic type (Wood 1987), were called into question while this study was in prepa- ration. Archaeologists are now beginning to realize that this phyllite-tempered pottery might not be distinct to Hohokam groups (Shaw and Marshall 2000; Stone 2000). Some of the sites used in this research are typed as Hohokam based on the presence of Wingfield Plain and although I acknowledge these new ideas, I have opted to continue with the term "Hohokam northern periphery" and with the Hohokam affiliation for Wingfield Plain until further archaeological work is complete. PETROGLYPH RECORDING METHODS Reclamation cultural resources staff conducted the rock art documentation in two phases. First, they identified the petroglyphs during initial site recording during the survey. Each boulder with a petroglyph was assigned a feature number, a cor- responding panel number, and a letter designation for each element. After all sites with petroglyphs were recorded and the initial inventory completed, Reclamation's cultural resource staff returned to each rock art site looking for additional petroglyphs. All new petroglyphs were assigned a feature number, and thorough documentation of each petroglyph was initiated. In this second phase of documentation, each panel was drawn to scale using a 1 m grid subdivided into 10 x 10 cm squares. Each drawing included the outline of the panel boundary represented by the boulder's edges, all elements, a scale, and a north arrow. Individual elements were determined by breaking points such as distinct, separate designs or breaks in the flow from one element to another. A panel number and letter designation were assigned to each element. All rock art panels were also photographed using both color slide and black-and-white film. A Central Arizona Project Repository Photographic Collections Data form was used to record frame number, subject of photo, lighting, panel orientation, and any additional comments. The crew completed a Reclamation Rock Art Panel Recording form for each panel. Attributes on the form included: rock type, panel orientation, approximate panel inclination, height and width of the panel from the ground level to the highest and lowest points on the boulder, height and width of the elements, panel datum and orientation, distance of the panel to the site datum, and a short description of each element. Next, colors of the rock surface and the design colors were recorded. Determinations of superimposition and incorporation of natural features in the boulder were recorded. Finally, the amount of desert varnish present on the panel was recorded using an arbitrary scale of 1 to 10. A score of 1 indicated no desert varnish, and 10 indicated that desert varnish covered the panel. The field examina- tion also included determination of the manufacturing style, such as whether the elements were pecked solid, stippled, outlined, if the elements included any sec- ondary smoothing, or were striated, abraded, drilled, incised, or contained other surface preparation such as scraping. Whether the petroglyphs were constructed as a result of direct or indirect percussion was not evaluated, however.</page><page sequence="5">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 189 Documentation also involved a condition assessment, noting any vandalism and whether the petroglyph was threatened by inundation, recreational activities, or erosion. Evaluation of natural deterioration was based on the presence of the following: drainage zones, exfoliation, bird droppings, abrasion, algae, mold, lichen, other vegetation, wind, and animals. Vandalism was categorized as graffiti, paint, ink markers, chalk, bullet holes, or attempted theft. All documentation is curated at the Central Arizona Project Repository in Tucson. ANALYTICAL METHODS The sample includes 401 elements distributed over 114 panels, 87 petroglyph stations, and 19 sites. Because Reclamation performed a 100 percent survey of the park as it existed in 1995, it is assumed that the petroglyphs represent a fairly complete inventory. The only known petroglyphs not included in this study are several that were located during the Central Arizona Water Control Study by Arizona State University (Rice and Bostwick 1986). They have been omitted due to a lack of descriptive information in the original report. Prior to the analysis, the panel drawings were laid out to ascertain the range of codes that would be necessary to characterize them. In an effort to achieve stan- dardization, I adopt the element classification system developed by Ferg (1979), revised by Wallace (1983), and summarized by Thiel (1995). Variables employed in the analysis are listed in Table 1. After the variables were coded, the data were entered into a Microsoft Access database. Frequencies of each element type con- firmed that so much diversity existed that even though terminology was consistent, the element types would have to be collapsed into broader categories to be managed.

Example of major element categories.</page><page sequence="7">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 191 The resulting major element categories include abstract lines, geometric shapes, life forms, random or amorphous pecking, and historic or modem writing. Abstract line symbols include rectilinear and curvilinear abstracts (which are items that could not be classified any other way), reticulates, sectioned rectangles, straight- line variations, mazes, and meandering lines. Geometric shapes include sun disks, asterisks, and variations of chevrons, diamonds, crosses, circles, spirals, swasti- kas, and pipettes. Life forms only include zoomorphs and anthropomorphs, which are primarily stick figures. Although the abstract lines might technically be categorized within the geo- metric shapes, when the two groups are laid out next to each other they present a very different look and were thus treated separately (Fig. 2). It should be noted that all "lizard-men" are included among the zoomorphs. This designation is based on the presence of a tail/phallus and arms and legs bent up or down at right angles. No definite human forms were observed with legs and arms bent at right angles co-occurring with a tail/phallus. The remaining two categories, random or amorphous pecking and historic or modem writing, are self-explanatory. Several additional subcategories were created to accommodate elements that could not be analyzed in isolation because they were attached to others; they include complex geometric, anthropomorph, and zoomorph. For example, a complex geo- metric may consist of several circles attached to a branching meander. A complex zoomorph may involve one or more snakes attached to a cluster of bull's-eyes and a branching meander. Complex anthropomorphs may have lines extending from their heads (headdresses?), spirals from their legs, and a sun disk from one of their arms. A spiral attached to a human is not counted among the frequency of geometric designs, but rather included with the complex anthropomorphs. These complex motifs are addressed separately below. THE LAKE PLEASANT PETROGLYPH ASSEMBLAGE Petroglyphs were recorded at 19 sites that include farmsteads, field houses, resource extraction sites, isolated boulders, and one historic Basque camp (Table 2). Based on surface artifacts and structures, the field houses and farmsteads are primarily Hohokam with unknown temporal components. Within the data set, life forms are the most common, followed by curvilinear and rectilinear lines and abstracts, geo- metric designs, random or amorphous pecking, and lastly, historic writing (Table 3). Within each of these categories, there is a great deal of diversity with very little repetition of any single element type. Three exceptions include meandering lines, branching meanders, and curved lines. Consequently, ranking commonality within the assemblage as a whole provides more insight to the importance of specific element types (Table 4). The categories in Table 4 represent the full range of diversity not seen in Table 3 because they were collapsed into the broader categories in order to provide more meaningful frequencies. For example, the types circle cluster,</page><page sequence="8">192 MORENO Table 2. Site Summary.

In addition, the style of some elements is unknown (n = 28). Because varnish was documented at the panel level rather than for each element, it was not possible to include this variable when seriating the assemblage.

As a result, style types for the individual elements are based on style defini- tions as they exist in the literature reviewed for each cultural category below, and are considered to be conservative. THE WESTERN ARCHAIC TRADITION Heizer and Baumhoff (1962) and Schaafsma (1980) defined Archaic-style petroglyphs of the Arizona desert as curvilinear and rectilinear ab- stracts in which parallel lines are arranged to form motifs such as the gridiron, single and double rakes, ladders, and cross-hatching. Thiel (1995) included footprints (Wallace and Holmlund 1986), vulvaforms, atlatls, centipedes, and cornstalks. Wallace and Holmlund (1986) added concentric circles, circles with dots, and sun disks. Because the concentric circles, circles with dots, sun disks, centipedes, and cornstalks can also be assigned to the Gila style attributed to the Hohokam, they are not included among those assigned to the Archaic in the Lake Pleasant data set. The hallmark of Archaic-style petroglyphs in LPRP appears to be footprints. For example, rep- resented on 18 features and 19 panels, eight sites exhibit 41 petroglyph elements (10.2 %) assigned to the Western Archaic Tradition. Archaic designs at LPRP are primarily dominated by feet with 3 to 5 toes (n = 21), followed by abstract lines, rakes, and reticulates (n = 16), and hands (n = 4). Nine of the footprints face roughly north to north- east and are positioned along the river's edge (Fig. 3). One panel with seven feet also faces the river, but the feet are oriented in the opposite direction, to the southeast (Fig. 4). Bruder (1983) reported 23 feet from Hedgepeth Hills (NA15,912) and one from NA15,914 in northern Phoenix. Although Bruder identified the rock art at Hedgepeth Hills as pri- marily Hohokam, some archaeologists now con- sider most petroglyphs at the site to be Archaic Table 4.

Feet petroglyphs along the Middle Agua Fria River in LPRP. (Bostwick 1989; Wallace and Holmlund 1986). Therefore, the presence of as many as 20 feet along the Middle Agua Fria in LPRP suggests the potential for considerable Archaic period use of the area. On the contrary, footprints appear to be rare in Hohokam assemblages (Wellman 1979). For example, one footprint known from the Tucson Basin is located at Tumamoc Hill (Ferg 1979), and several are repre- sented on a large panel at Cumero Mountain in southeastern Arizona (Burton and Farrell 1990). Seven feet are represented at Tempe Butte; however, no human foot- prints or handprints were recorded in over 8,000 designs in the South Mountains (Bostwick and Krocek 2002). Other elements at Hedgepeth Hills that are present in the Lake Pleasant assem- blage include hands with and without arms (Fig. 5). Doolittle (1999) reported that handprints are present at Antelope Hill, Sears Point, and Quail Point in western Arizona; Martynec and Martynec (1995) reported one handprint from El Conejo Cementario; and Doolittle (1999) purported that handprints, as well as digitate anthropomorphs, are representative of the Patayan rock art style characteristic of the assemblage at Antelope Hill. His rationale is based on the assumption that there is no known Hohokam occupation there. Thiel (1995) identified broken dia- monds with "feet" as part of the Patayan style. One broken diamond with branching legs is present in the Lake Pleasant assemblage suggesting the possibility (if Thiel's assumption is correct), that Patayan people may have had an influence in the</page><page sequence="13">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 197 o v, O' u ,.a a ~ ~ ~ ~ , ,. .'a ,.

No diagnostic Patayan material culture was identified during the intensive cultural resource survey of the park, however. Furthermore, it is equally possible that both the hands and feet along the Middle Agua Fria, as well as at Hedgepeth Hills, are a result of northern influence. Hand- prints are common in the Anasazi rock art of Canyon de Chelly (Grant 1978). Hands, feet, and anthropomorphs with extremely exaggerated hands and feet are part of the Archaic and San Juan Basketmaker styles of southwestern Colorado (Cole 1990). Additionally, Pilles (1974) identified human hands and feet as part of the Pueblo II style along the Little Colorado River in northern Arizona. Humans with exaggerated hands and feet are also common in the Mesa Canyon region north of LPRP in the Central Arizona Ecotone Project area (Fernstrom 1984), although these have not been assigned to a time period. Another design bears a striking resemblance to one identified at Hedgepeth Hills by Bruder (1983:235) as a dragon. The Lake Pleasant "dragon" is associated with other curvilinear and rectilinear abstract elements (Fig. 6). Two other examples of Archaic-style rock art identified along the Middle Agua Fria include one large panel that includes another anomalous creature, possibly a phosphene, an image perceived in the brain in the absence of visual stimuli that may occur while someone is in a trance-like state (see Hedges 1987) (Fig. 7). The other is represented by hands, feet, curvilinear, and rectilinear abstract designs created by combining varia- tions of straight and wavy parallel lines (Fig. 8). Previously, no petroglyphs of the Western Archaic tradition were known from the Middle Agua Fria area. In fact, the most recent inventory of Western Archaic petroglyph sites in Arizona shows none in the Lake Pleasant area or immediately to the north (Thiel 1995:67). Regardless of what these drawings were intended to represent, they are distinct from the later Gila-style glyphs typically drawn by the Hohokam and closely resemble many of the glyphs seen at Hedgepeth Hills that are now thought to be Archaic. GILA-STYLE GLYPHS ALONG THE MIDDLE AGUA FRIA Schaafsma (1980) is credited with outlining the general characteristics of Hohokam petroglyphs referred to as the Gila style. According to Schaafsma (1980), a substantial number of both abstract and representational designs make up the repertoire of Hohokam petroglyphs. Life forms include human figures, game animals, canids, reptiles, birds, pipettes, and sometimes insects and artifacts. Anthropomorphs and quadrupeds are typically stick figures. Hourglass-shaped humans, however, are present in the South Mountains (Bostwick 1999; Bostwick and Krocek 2002; Golio and Snyder 1993), as well as in the Tucson Basin (Martynec 1986). Humans holding balls or staffs, wearing headdresses, with expanded midsections, full figures or exaggerated hands and/or feet are relatively common (Bostwick 1998a; Thiel 1995).</page><page sequence="16">200 MORENO 05 10 A cnm e centimeters Figure 6. Examples of "dragons" from A Feature 4, AZ T:4:160 (ASM), and B Hedgepeth Hills. Gila-style petroglyphs are present at all but four of the rock art sites identified in LPRP (Table 2) and include 327 elements (73.8 %) represented on 64 features and 102 panels. Based on the gross categories defined in Table 4, abstract (n = 95) and geometric (n = 94) forms of Gila-style elements are equally represented. Life forms are nearly 31 percent more common (n = 137). Among the abstract elements, meandering lines are the most common followed by curvilinear abstracts (including branching meanders), straight-line variations, rectilinear abstracts, a sectioned rect- angle, and a maze (five or more interlocking lines). Within the geometric design elements, circle variations (only two with central dots, one of which is a cluster)</page><page sequence="17">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 201 0 5 10 centimeters Figure 7. Anomalous Archaic panel from AZ T:3:205 (ASM). occur the most frequently, followed by complex geometric designs, crosses and Xs, spiral variations (both left and right), variations of chevrons, swastikas, a possible pipette, sun disks, and asterisks. Life forms include 65 individual zoomorphs, 13 complex zoomorphs, 43 individual depictions of partial or complete humans, and 19 complex anthropomorphs. Some of the typical (but not necessarily common) Gila-style element types in the Lake Pleasant collection and their variations are represented in Figure 9. Although some sheep, canids, lizards, and humans are "true figures," they are much less common. None of the anthropomorphs appear to be in motion like the dancing figures that are present at South Mountain (Bostwick</page><page sequence="18">202 MORENO Co A 0 5 10 centimeters i, !, a Figure 8. Archaic panel from AZ T:4:157 (ASM). and Krocek 2002). Because anthropomorphs are so prevalent among the LPRP inventory, no locational patterning was recognized as it was with the Archaic foot- prints and handprints. In general, the list closely corresponds to the roster of Hohokam rock art images defined by Bostwick (1998a) and Bostwick and Krocek (2002).

In reference to the actual frequencies outlined above that indicate life forms are significantly more frequent than geometric or abstract designs, the data set as a whole is consistent with previous petroglyph studies in both the Tucson and Salt-Gila Basins, as well as the Hohokam northern periphery. For example, Wallace (1983) found that life forms are more common than abstracts and that anthropomorphs are more common than zoomorphs at several major petroglyph sites in the Tucson Basin (Los Morteros, Tumamoc Hill, Apache Peak, Red Hill, AZ AA:12:36 [ASM], and AZ BB:14:27 [ASM]). Although aggregate life forms depicted in the South Mountains make up only 37 percent of the assem- blage, Snyder (1966) reported that human figures are the most common. Bostwick and Krocek (2002) found that nearly one-quarter of all recorded elements were anthropomorphs, which supports Snyder's results; however, the presence and fre- quency of anthropomorphs at Hohokam sites needs a better comparative database before anything can be said about them. Other similarities exist between the LPRP data set and the frequencies of element types at other sites in the Salt-Gila Basin. For example, among the geometric images along the Middle Agua Fria, circle variations are 25 percent more common than the next most frequently depicted geometric shape. Loendorf and Loendorf (1995) demonstrated a high frequency of circle variations (9.4 %) at Tempe Butte, including spirals and concentric circles. They argued that the concentration of glyphs on south-facing slopes provides support for the petroglyphs' use as calendars. South- facing slopes provide a better view of the sun's movement, and the movement of shadows is more pronounced in the winter. It is significant to note that 40 of the 41 Gila-style circle variations identified along the Middle Agua Fria River face south or southeast. Snyder (1966) also reported a high frequency of circle variations in the South Mountains, but did not provide information about their orientation. Bostwick and Krocek (2002) found that several sun disks, spirals, and circles in the South Mountains also face southeast and northeast, aligning with the two solstices. Johnson (1995) contends that outlined crosses represent Venus. Ten variations of crosses are also present including one outlined cross. One is oriented north (351a to 102), two are oriented north-northwest (3162 to 3502), two are north-north- east (112 to 45-), two are east-southeast (1019 to 135-), one is south (1702 to 190-), one is west-southwest (2269 to 2609), and one is west (2629 to 280a). The only sun disk in the LPRP collection is oriented south-southeast (136- to 169-). At petroglyph sites in the Hohokam northern periphery, such as the Greenway Road and Seventeenth Avenue site (AZ T:8:102 [ASU]), anthropomorphs are the most common, followed by zoomorphs (including quadrupeds), geometric sym- bols, curvilinear and rectilinear abstract lines, unidentifiable glyphs, and modern glyphs (Bostwick 1989). Rodgers (1985) reported on northern periphery petroglyphs from the Terrace Garden site (AZ T:8:19 [ASM]). Because of inconsistent recording, analytical, and reporting methods, it is not possible to ascertain the overall compo-</page><page sequence="21">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 205 sition of the assemblage at this site; however, Rodgers does state that nine-tenths of the anthropomorphs are stick figures showing leg and arm motion as if dancing. One of the humans is holding a staff, and one has an expanded midsection (none of which are present in LPRP). The nine zoomorphs are limited to reptiles and mammals. The mammals may be deer or antelope. Based on diagnostic ceramics, Rodgers argued that the rock art is Hohokam and was created during the Santa Cruz and Sacaton phases. Direct comparisons of Gila-style glyphs to other northern periphery sites, such as Hedgepeth Hills, is also difficult because researchers now believe the majority of petroglyphs there are Archaic rather than Hohokam as Bruder (1983) originally argued. As a result, Gila-style and Western Archaic assemblages were not distin- guished. Nevertheless, Bruder (1983) noted that 82 percent of the assemblage is composed of either curvilinear or rectilinear abstracts or geometric elements. Together, anthropomorphs and zoomorphs, two element types that may be more definitively assigned to the Hohokam, only make up 10 percent of the total collection. These proportions actually support the overall Archaic nature of the Hedgepeth assemblage. Although the above discussion of the Lake Pleasant data set has focused on the frequencies of various element types, it is important to expand beyond frequencies. Thiel (1995:78) pointed out that "simple element tallies will not be sufficient to discern regional variation." Based on his current work on the South Mountains petroglyphs, Bostwick and Krocek (2002) argued that regional and temporal com- parisons based on frequencies are inadequate unless all known data are consid- ered. Nevertheless, the above data have been provided as a baseline. What is more important, however, is to focus on how the individual elements are joined to form designs and how designs are then combined on the rock face. COMPLEX DESIGNS ALONG THE MIDDLE AGUA FRIA Complex geometric (n = 29), anthropomorphic (n = 19), and zoomorphic (n = 13) designs are present in the data. Complex designs are a combination of two or more element types (Table 5). Figures 10 through 12 demonstrate how some of these are combined and presented on a panel. A common theme in Figure 10 is partial or complete anthropomorphs wearing headdresses, tethered to animals or objects, emerging from cracks in the rock, arms and legs forming spirals, or being formed by closed meanders giving the person a ghostly appearance. What is also charac- teristic of this panel is the use of snakes to form the line work in the design. This is also seen on other panels, such as Figure 11, where fewer life forms are repre- sented but those that are present are also formed with snake motifs, including the quadruped on the left side of the panel. In their work with the South Mountains petroglyphs, Bostwick and Krocek (2002) noted the popularity of snakes as a common design element, occurring alone and with anthropomorphs or as part of their bodies. Some have horns or are plumed. Some spirals in the South Mountains are also</page><page sequence="22">206 MORENO Table 5. List of Complex Designs in the Lake Pleasant Assemblage.

Bostwick also noted that the incorporation of natural rock features, such as cracks, is common among the Hohokam of the Salt-Gila Basin. Bruder (1983) noted this for Hedgepeth Hills.

INTERPRETATION Although the intended meaning of any petroglyph is impossible to identify with certainty, some rock art may represent world views, sacred activities, or everyday scenes. Bostwick (1998b) described complex scenes of humans interacting with mammals, birds, and reptiles among the South Mountains petroglyphs. Further- more, certain Hohokam anthropomorphs have body ornaments, such as headdresses, suggesting they are people of ritual importance. He interpreted these panels as shamanistic scenes of power. Bostwick based this on the similarity of the Hohokam panels with scenes of shamanistic art from around the world. As Bostwick pointed out, Eliade (1964) noted that the main theme of shamanistic art concerns the voyage through cosmic geography, which includes the three levels of sky or underworld. Associated art motifs include maps of the sacred geography, representations of death, dismemberment, animal transformations, life energy (usually represented by sinuous lines), flight, and solarization. Portals are represented by spirals and concentric circles (Halifax 1982). Bostwick (1998b) identified five</page><page sequence="26">210 MORENO general characteristics of shamanistic rock art in the South Mountains: 1) animals are much larger than humans, 2) humans are sometimes connected to or appear to be subduing animals, 3) some of the humans carry canes or other paraphernalia, 4) natural holes and cracks are incorporated into the scene, possibly representing portals to the underworld, and 5) geometric designs are associated such as spirals, concentric circles, pipettes, and figure eights. A number of complex panels along the Middle Agua Fria exhibit the last four characteristics. One distinctive example is that of a large segmented anthropomorph attached to a spiral at the midsection. No legs are present, but the lower body is formed by a smaller partial human. Directly below are several unidentifiable symbols. On either side of this large human are a smaller human and a lizard-man (tallied as a zoomorph in this study) each with spirals con- nected to their bodies (Fig. 13). Several elements of shamanistic art are present, including the spirals attached to the individuals, possibly suggesting the persons are emerging from a portal. Based on the above information, it is also possible to speculate that the large segmented human represents a state of transformation while passing through the underworld. One more panel of shamanistic artwork is shown in Figure 14. The full-bodied human in a horizontal position is the only one of its kind in the assemblage and is worth noting because it is interacting with one quadruped in particular (a canid?), with a series of others nearby. Bostwick (1998b) also discussed the association of animal spirit helpers that shamans use for divination or weather control. These type of scenes are also present in the South Mountains. One last Gila-style panel that remains to be discussed is the potential represen- tation of a topographic feature (Fig. 15). The panel depicts the possible contour lines of the terrace where the site is located. Although detailed contours of the area are not available, the outline bears a resemblance to the general topography in the site's immediate vicinity. Similar petroglyphs have been identified in the Hohokam northern periphery (Rodgers 1985), at Picacho Peak north of Tucson, and at Kitt Peak, west of Tucson (Wallace and Holmlund 1986), and are thought to be maps. The likeness between the LPRP and Picacho Peak petroglyphs include a goggle- like motif formed by the paired bull's-eyes seen in the upper left of the panel (Fig. 14) and numerous other single bull's-eyes and circles. While the panel may not have served as a road map, the consistency in the design of these two unrelated panels (the only "goggles" present in LPRP) suggests a similar function. Furthermore, this petroglyph was not categorized as a maze not only because of the similarity between the associated design elements at Picacho Peak and LPRP, but because the two petroglyphs determined to be mazes in the LPRP group were characteristically different. The mazes were formed by a series of rectilinear interlocking lines, the same as those identified by Bostwick and Krocek (2002:170-171) and dissimilar to the series of parallel lines seen in Figure 14 that form the likeness of a ridge.</page><page sequence="27">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 211 Ln E o :i*I Figure 13.

Literature on indigenous Protohistoric rock art is extremely scant. Peter Pilles (per- sonal communication 2001) suggests that horsemen, circled crosses, and other shield-like motifs may be characteristic. The presence of a Yavapai-style projectile</page><page sequence="30">214 MORENO 0 5 10 centimeters 4 -LI Figures 1 6A and 1 6B. Examples of Protohistoric rock art from AZ T:4:160 (ASM). point collected from the site indicates that Protohistoric people were present at the site, albeit briefly (Moreno et al. 2001). The third example of a post-Hohokam petroglyph along the Middle Agua Fria is at AZ T:3:95 (ASM). This panel is historic and reads: "Disie 7 1920 Manuel Lucero." Based on the style of architecture and the surface assemblage, this petroglyph as well as the site may be associated with Basque sheep herding activities in the Lake Pleasant region. Furthermore, Stein (1991) also pointed out that Spanish inscriptions of individual names are one of the defining features of Basque sheep camps and are usually carved in aspen trees. In the absence of a tree, perhaps a boulder sufficed.</page><page sequence="31">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 215 LOCATIONAL ANALYSIS OF PETROGLYPHS ALONG THE MIDDLE AGUA FRIA Numerous previous rock art researchers have noted locational relationships between petroglyph panels or individual elements with certain site types, elevations, or topographical features. For example, Ferg (1979) found nearly all phallic stick figures without phalanges occur at the top of Tumamoc Hill, but nearly all of the nonphallic figures with phalanges occur at the bottom. Wallace (1983) determined that many of the petroglyphs at several Tucson Basin sites are associated with activity areas and are located near drainages. In a topographical study of rock art sites, Hamann and Hedges (1986) observed that 55 percent of the 153 sites they examined were associated with major rivers, large tributary washes (27.5 %), and small side drainages (11 %). Those not directly associated with a watercourse appeared to be in the mountains or on isolated buttes, possibly marking waterholes. Finally, Rodgers (1985) argued that rock art panels at numerous sites in the Hohokam northern periphery (e.g., the Terrace Garden site discussed above) are elevated, in locations that overlook agricultural fields. In addition to the geographic association of these sites, some such as those on moun- tains and buttes in Hamann and Hedges' and Rodgers' studies may have had astro- nomical functions as well. Topographically, the LPRP rock art assemblage follows a similar pattern to that found by Hamann and Hedges (1986). Among the 19 prehistoric sites with petroglyphs, all but three are directly associated with the Agua Fria or a major tributary. One is situated on a small feeder drainage, and two are in mountainous areas. Eleven of the 19 are situated north or west of their corresponding water- course, three are south of drainages, and one is east. The side of the drainage on which the site was placed appears to strongly correlate not only with the direction most of the panels face, but also with where they are placed within the site. For example, nearly all of the panels are located along the south and southeast edges of the sites. In addition, 79 (70 %) of the panels actually face south (170a to 190) or southeast (101- to 1699) toward the watercourse nearest the site. Of the remaining panels, 16 face activity areas, 10 face away from the activity areas and drainages, and 7 face upward. The upward-facing panels include one reticulate, three curvi- linear meandering lines (one with branches), a concentric circle with four rings, and two partial anthropomorphs. In addition to the relational preferences of site location, panel location, and panel orientation, there is the potential for a preference in the orientation of some element types. For example, while most directions are represented, no panels face between 46' and 79' (east-northeast). Northwest also seems to be less desirable, with only 27 of the 401 elements documented and analyzed facing northwest ('3169 to 3509). Nearly half of these are zoomorphs, two are spirals, one is a meandering line, one is a curvilinear abstract, two are crosses, six are anthropomorphs, and one is historic Spanish writing. As noted above, most circle variations face southeast.</page><page sequence="32">216 MORENO Even though one of the most common element types is a curvilinear meandering line, none of these face northwest. Although it is hard to imagine this as simply coincidence; it is unclear why no panel faces east-northeast (unless this direction was simply taboo). The fact that a northwesterly direction is less favored for petroglyphs may be related to the function of the rock art and the necessity for it to face outward toward watercourses, which in this area are primarily to the south or southeast of the sites. Although I acknowledge that some of these differences may be temporal rather than cultural, these data suggest that rock art was not intended for the everyday use of the prehistoric site occupants. Perhaps they were billboards for people traveling along the drainages that meant "this spot is taken" or "this is who we are." Sufficient data are not available to directly address this issue. None- theless, based on some of the complex elements and panels, I suggest that some panels had spiritual meaning. Whether the meaning is tied to various cardinal directions is beyond the scope of this paper. CONCLUSION Previously, no rock art assemblages from the Middle Agua Fria had been studied. This research serves as an important contribution to petroglyph research throughout the U.S. Southwest, particularly central Arizona. Although it is acknowledged that simple frequencies may not be enough to bring about a more reliable interpretation of rock art, their examination has shown that there is a great deal of overlap in the use of similar elements from site to site, region to region, and between temporal periods. Furthermore, researchers must strive to provide databases that rely on consistency of recording and analytical methods as well as sample description and comparison. By focusing on frequencies of element types and their styles, four temporal and cultural affiliations for the rock art of the Middle Agua Fria have been identified: Archaic, Hohokam, Protohistoric Yavapai, and Historic period Basque. A com- parison of the data with other regions in the Southwest, including the Tucson and Salt-Gila Basins, the Hohokam northern periphery, and areas as far north as the Four Corners, clearly indicates that a strong Hohokam component is present. These results are consistent with those found during the intensive cultural resources survey, which strongly indicated Hohokam occupation, primarily during the Colonial and Sedentary periods; however, a small Classic period occupation cannot be ruled out (Moreno et al. 2001). The results of this research also indicate a strong relation- ship between the placement of petroglyphs, settlement decision-making, and the appropriate orientation of certain elements. In addition, this study has attempted to go beyond simple frequencies and focus on the meaning of individual panels. While rock art can't be read like a book, viewing the complex designs and panels as representations of the way people saw themselves and the world they lived in could provide more information about extinct</page><page sequence="33">Petroglyphs of Lake Pleasant Regional Park 217 lifestyles than, for instance, distributions of pottery styles may ever provide. In effect, the serious study of rock art has a strong potential to put more anthropology back into archaeology. Acknowledgments. Primarily funded by Reclamation, this study could not have been done without the excellent recording and illustration of the petroglyphs by Carole Telles, Dave Gifford, and Andrea Ondreyco. I wrote the original draft of this paper as a deliverable with the intention to publish under ACS' on-call services contract with Reclamation. ACS also provided funding and key personnel who worked very hard to provide the technical support necessary to get the data computerized and create the figures; specifically, Alissa Bentz illustrated the rock art panels based on the original field drawings by Andrea Ondreyco, Brad Dilli oversaw the data entry and gave effective advice for organizing the analysis, Kelly Melaniphy performed the data entry, Lourdes Aguila translated the abstract, and Ron Russell drafted the project area map. ACS' production editor, Paige Barlow, coordinated the final changes with ACS personnel and produced electronic and hard copies of the article. I would also like to thank Margerie Green for editing the draft and providing the opportunity to conduct the research, which I have really enjoyed. Several other researchers who have conducted petroglyph investigations graciously shared infor- mation integral in compiling this paper. Most significantly, Todd Bostwick of Pueblo Grande Museum spent considerable time looking at the field drawings and providing ideas, feedback, and research materials. Rex Weeks of the Deer Valley Rock Art Center provided input regarding analytical methods and generously assisted in pulling the background material together. Peter Pilles of the Coconino Na- tional Forest contributed his knowledge of Protohistoric petroglyphs pertaining to the Yavapai occupa- tion of the area. Finally, I would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments (all of which have been incorporated) and the courteous way in which they critiqued this paper.
