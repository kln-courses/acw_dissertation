<plain_text><page sequence="1">Allen's 'Golden Plover and other Birds' is an attractive volumel forming the second series of 'American Bird Biographies,' the first of which, published in 1934, proved its value in a wide popular demand. In each of its twenty-seven chapters, some characteristic bird of eastern North America relates its own life history or oc- casionally brings in further information concerning its near allies. Most of these bird autobiographies have previously appeared in 'Bird-Lore' under the Audubon Society's 'School Department,' of which the author is also editor. The success of these brief, character sketches has led the author to continue the method of presenta- tion in which each bird in turn recounts its affairs in easy conversational language. While this may tend to encourage the anthropomorphic trend of the younger readers, the whole is so skillfully done that the resulting feeling of more intimate acquaint- ance through the personal touch amply compensates for any possible misconception. The concluding pages consist of a series of questionnaires, one for each of the twenty- seven chapters, wherein the Latin name of each bird alone occurs, as a caption, to be followed by twenty-five questions, the answers to all of which may be found in the appropriate text. It thus becomes a book full of suggestions for Nature teachers in the elementary schools while as a school reader it should serve to arouse in younger persons a real interest in the study of birds. The wealth of photographic illustration throughout the text is of the author's usual high order of excellence, although the reproduction of shaded areas may in some instances be unsatisfactory in half-tone cuts printed with the text. The seven beautiful full-page plates in color by Dr. G. M. Sutton further add to the attractive- ness of the volume. There is no apparent method in the arrangement of the chapters which might perhaps have been grouped so that the sequence of the species treated should follow their systematic order as a further help for the reader. The lack of an index is hardly a serious matter, since the desired chapter may be readily found in the table of contents.
