<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poema Pictura Loquens: Literary Pictorialism and The Psychology of Landscape E. ALLEN McCORMICK ABSTRACT Lessing's opposition to descriptive nature poetry, based on his conviction that the dynamic is essentially opposed to the pictorial, has tended to ob- scure the underlying unity of painting and poetry. In reply to Lessing, one may proceed from the argument of his English contemporary, Edmund Burke, that verbal description evokes the effect of objects rather than sensu- ous images of them, and attempt to examine nature description and land- scape as inventions of the mind and hence amenable to psychological explication. Goethe's Werther contains landscape descriptions which point back to the locus amoenus and appeal to the reader's memory at a psychological level, similar to the schemata of painting. To fit his emotional needs, Wer- ther shapes landscapes, creates vistas and refuges, appropriates a garden, etc., and through this process of memory and projection introduces the underlying structures of landscape, which are constants of human behavior. (EAM) In the sixteenth and seventeenth chapters of the Laokoon, Les- sing makes his famous distinction between painting and poetry and, in doing so, takes descriptive poetry severely to task. In opposi- tion to a then prevalent belief that poetry should give vivid word descriptions and painting parallel visual descriptions (the well known fanciful reading of ut pictura poesis), Lessing argues that because of a dissimilarity of materials and principles of construc- tion painting and poetry should not be doing essentially the same thing. On the contrary, each art has effects proper to it: Bodies with their visible properties are the true subjects of painting and actions the true subjects of poetry. Since bodies exist in time as well as in space, painting can also imitate actions and poetry can depict bodies. But only by suggestion: painting by using the most suggestive moment of an action, and poetry by using but one single property of a body.l From these general premises Lessing then proceeds to describe and weigh the special advantages and disadvantages of each art and to conclude that poetry is, after all, superior. It is scarcely necessary here to follow Lessing's arguments and to offer the somewhat obvious rebuttals to what we now recognize as one- sided views of painting particularly (which has the impossible 196</page><page sequence="2">LITERARY PICTORIALISM 197 task of standing for sculpture as well). Rather, we may concern our- selves briefly with his attitude to word-painting, to literary pictori- alism as he found it in European literature from Homer to the mid- eighteenth century. To Lessing, illusion is the "principal object of poetry," but it is precisely this which is necessarily lacking in the verbal description of bodies. That which the eye takes in at a single glance [the poet] counts out to us with perceptible slowness, and it often happens that when we arrive at the end of his description we have already forgotten the first features. And yet we are supposed to form a notion of the whole from these features. 2 Succession in time, Lessing concludes, is the province of the poet just as space is that of the painter. Detailed depictions of physical objects. . . have always been recognized by the best critics as being pieces of pedantic trifling, to which little or no genius can be attributed. When the poetaster, says Horace, can do nothing more, he be- gins to paint a grove, an altar, a brook meandering through pleasant meadows, a rushing stream, a rainbow. (Ars poet tea 16)3 And Alexander Pope, Lessing reminds us, called a purely descriptive poem a banquet of nothing but sauces. A few scattered but equally explicit observations on landscape description are found in the Entwurfe zum Laokoon. Number 10 contains these suggestive lines: Condemnation of Thomson's painting. Concerning landscape painters; whether or not there is an ideal in landscape beauty. This to be denied. Hence the lower value of painters of landscape. The Greeks and Italians have none.4 And Number 6 of the Bemerkungen und Materialien echoes this negative attitude: The highest beauty of form is found solely in man, and even there solely by virtue of an ideal. This ideal is found less frequently in animals, in vegetation and inanimate nature not at all. It is this fact which determines the rank of the flower and landscape painter. He imitates beauties that are incapable of any ideal; and so he works only with his eye and his hand, and genius has little or no part in his work.5 In summoning Horace and Pope to his defense, Lessing is illustrat- ing his belief that nature is not a subject for the whole mind, that in itself it cannot really contain or represent a human ideal. But when he quotes Horace as saying that when a versifier hasn't any- thing better to do he paints a grove with meadows, streams, etc., Lessing is guilty of perverting the Roman's meaning. Horace is speaking of sticking to the subject, of not wandering off into de- scriptive digressions; he is not attacking verbal description, i.e., pictorialism per se, nor of course depictions of Arcadian landscapes. And as for Pope's condemnation of descriptive poetry as a feast made up of sauces, we had best see in Lessing's reference a carefully</page><page sequence="3">198 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES chosen substitute for any mention of The Seasons, by far the most influential of eighteenth-century descriptive poems, to whose author Lessing had made an unambiguous commitment exactly ten years earlier: No epoch and no place on earth has produced a more painterly poet than he. All of visible nature is his painting, in which one observes the bright and happy, the serious and frightening scenes of the changing year arise one from the other and merge in like manner.6 Did Lessing change his mind - or discover a new law for art - in the decade between this little preface to James Thomson's tragedies and the planned condemnation of his Malerei (relegated, as we saw, to the preliminary sketches to the Laokoon or else cavalierly diverted to Pope)? Scarcely. Lessing's opposition to the pictorial in literature stems from an inherent distrust of (and therefore, we should say, a negative psychological attitude towards) nature description, enumer- ative descriptions of wild and domestic landscapes. The aesthetic justification comes later and, although sincere, does not really answer basic questions about landscape in poetry, which we propose to raise in these remarks. If the poet is to awaken vivid ideas in us and thereby create a mo- ment of illusion so like the real impression that we forget his medium, then he must either renounce visualization and the static or else he must so emphasize progression that it is not the accumulated char- acteristics or objects - the completed description as an entity - which become paramount but the actual movement from one part or one image to another, that is to say, plot or action. There must be, in other words, a conversion from simultaneity to sequentiality. A picture must arise before our eyes; but Lessing fears that the dynamic quality of poetry will in itself hinder the attainment of illusion. This is a dramatist busy at theorizing, one whose tendency to overstate and oversimplify on occasion led him to stress what paint- ing and poetry ought to do at the expense of what these arts can at times additionally do. This emphasis on the normative rather than the descriptive, not always conscious in Lessing, leads him also to speak of the "Bestimmung einer Kunst," and poetry's calling is to do that and only that which it is uniquely suited to do: to dramatize, to portray action (Handlung), which at Mendelssohn's urging later became movement (Bewegung). But action is really the better word for Lessing: at the center of his world is not nature but Man, think- ing, acting Man, whose chief trait is Geist just as Kôrper is painting's chief trait. Ut pictura poesis and descriptive nature poetry never fully recover from this essay marking the limits of two but partially comprehended arts. There is not a little of this sentiment in Georg Lukacs' insistence, for example, that "the descriptive method lacks humanity. Its transformation of men into still lives is only the</page><page sequence="4">LITERARY PICTORIALISM 199 artistic manifestation of its inhumanity."7 We have begun our remarks on landscape in literature with the Laokoon less in a spirit of contradiction - though we know Lessing to have been incorrect in his basic assumptions about nature writing - than in the knowledge that Man's responsiveness to nature combines with art (specifically with narrative) so early as to suggest far deeper and more complex relationships between the two than neoclassical theory can fully accept or than pre-romantic and ro- mantic practice can do justice to. Let us begin anew and use the term poema pictura loquens, keep- ing in substance what has demonstrably faded in eighteenth-century theory. Lessing's contemporary, Edmund Burke, published his in- quiry into The Sublime and Beautiful in 1757, ironically close, in fact, to the German's praise of James Thomson as a word-painter. But Burke's essay represents an important influence on the Laokoon (1766), especially in its rejection of poetry as a mimetic art: In reality, poetry and rhetoric do not succeed in exact descriptions so well as painting does; their business is, to affect rather by sympathy than imitation; to display rather the effect of things on the mind of the speaker, or of others, than to present a clear idea of the things themselves. This is their most exten- sive province, and that in which they succeed the best.8 And Burke continues: We yield to sympathy what we refuse to description. The truth is, all verbal description, merely as naked description, though never so exact, conveys so poor and insufficient an idea of the thing described, that it could scarcely have the smallest effect, if the speaker did not call in to his aid those modes of speech that mark a strong and lively feeling in himself. Then, by the con- tagion of our passions, we catch a fire already kindled in another, which prob- ably might never have been struck out by the object described. Words, by strongly conveying the passions .... fully compensate for their weakness in other respects. If the affection be well conveyed, it will work its effect without any clear idea, often without any idea at all of the thing which has originally given rise to it. 9 How strikingly, by the way, does this foreshadow modern thinking on the subject. In his Psychology of Art, Vygotsky (following Chris- tiansen) asserts that in the visual arts as well as in poetry the image- less impression is the final aim of representing an object.10 Unfor- tunately, Burke does not pursue his argument that visual imagi- nation is not at all crucial to verbal description. The essay ends here, but we have nevertheless come rather close to the center of our own inquiry into pictorialism. Verbal description is to be judged by its emotional effects; what it evokes is not sensuous images but the effect of objects. It is ultimately, therefore, a transfer or a recreation of feelings. Burke thus leans to rhetoric as Lessing does to Aristo- telian action.</page><page sequence="5">200 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES At this point it might seem that we are in danger of becoming grounded in critical banality. We would argue, on the contrary, that by using our two examples of eighteenth-century theorists rejecting or sharply modifying ut pictura poesis, we are reminding ourselves of a few simple truths relevant to our inquiry: 1) Poetry is nonpictorial philological representation. This along with its pronouncedly temporal aspect would seem to render it far less suitable for some kinds of description. 2) As to subject matter, it should be perfectly clear that no art can convey from reality anything other than an abstraction, a biased rendering, in other words, which will not be a copy but an effect (as Burke rightly says about verbal descriptions). 3) Nature, therefore, or that which we are examining as land- scape must in any artistic context be seen as an invention of the mind and consequently subject to psychological expli- cation. To return for a final look at Lessing's theory of painting and poetry: it is generally true that action or the sequential is natural to poetry rather than to painting - static painting, not the serial vision of film - and that a sensory image of a scene is often more vividly rendered by a painting than by verbal description. But there is a level on which the essential differences in materials and techniques cease to have the importance generally and initially ascribed to them. And so while it may seem useful to reject paral- lels (as between poetry and painting or architecture and music) or to point out the flourishing and waning of styles and tendencies which consciously adopt such correspondences - picturesque writing in the eighteenth century - one must keep in mind that the real issue is not the theoretical legitimacy of analogies and parallels but whether or not there is some conceptual pattern in such relationships. It is this which we seek in literature as it turns to landscape and appears to behave in a painterly way. In a lecture called "Deceptive Analogies: Specious and Real Relationships among the Arts,'* Susanne Langer formulates what we have called the conceptual pattern in art relationships this way: But if you trace the differences among the arts as far and as minutely as possible, there comes a point beyond which no more distinctions can be made. It is the point where the deeper structural devices - ambivalent images, inter- secting forces, great rhythms and their analogues in detail, variations, con- gruences, in short: all the organizing devices - reveal the principles of dy- namic form that we learn from nature as spontaneously as we learn language from our elders. These principles appear, in one art after another, as the</page><page sequence="6">LITERARY PICTORIALISM 201 guiding ones in every work that achieves organic unity, vitality of form or expressiveness, which is what we mean by the significance of art. Where no more distinctions can be found among the several arts, there lies their unity.11 While conceding a possible overstatement in this view, especially in regard to the term "organic unity," we nonetheless accept the notion of deeper structural devices, behind which we posit basic formula- tions of feeling common to all the arts. However, another difficulty arises as we turn to the concrete example of landscape, by which we mean simply natural environ- ment perceived in some sort of compositional way, i.e., pictorial representation or visualization of countryside. The enjoyment of landscape is essentially aesthetic, although we are still unable fully to account for it since, as with virtually all aesthetic response, so many things enter into it. Moreover, it is no simple matter to dis- tinguish between enjoyment of landscape in nature and enjoyment of landscape representation in the arts. Indeed, during the florescence of the Picturesque, nature was almost always seen pictorially, that is, through mediation of certain principles of form. "Landscape, scene, prospect demanded that the land be thought of as itself composed into the formal patterns which previously a landscape painter would have thought of himself as imposing upon it."1* The treatment of landscape in literature and the visual arts does not change appreciably from this actual contemplation as an eight- eenth-century social accomplishment. As has been recognized, it involved "recognizing the stretch of land under your eye not, simply, as that - as an area of ground filled with various objects, trees, hills, fields - but as a complex of associations and meanings, and, more im- portant, as a composition, in which each object bore a specific and analysable relationship to the others."13 Recognition of the formal structure of "real" landscape, that is, of landscape as composition, goes far towards removing the glass pane of art between Man and reality of which Ortega y Gasset speaks in his Dehumanization of Art; for here, nature is copying art, is being arranged into compo- sitional patterns. But the overwhelming problem, the aesthetic ques- tion, still remains, which is how a visual arrangement, in painting or in nature, can be translated into a structure of words. One view holds that landscape description in poetry is essentially a verbal, hence consecutive, rendition of a painted or a visualized actual landscape. Italian classical landscapes, paintings by Claude Lorrain, Salvator Rosa, Poussin and others created a tradition, as we know, which in effect represented a way of seeing and composing landscape poetry. Much of Thomson's style in the Seasons relates directly to this tradition. Such a view therefore assumes that a land- scape poet imitates the process of composition and the pictorial</page><page sequence="7">202 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES organization of painting. The verbal structure of a passage would in this view mirror in its medium the composition of a landscape in art or in the artful nature of the eighteenth century. Words, in their syntax, grammar, and word order come to equal the schemata of painting. Basic to this theory of translated landscape is eye move- ment: as the eye registers objects in the landscape and arranges them into a composition (that is to say, understands and thus perceives the artist's arrangement), so does the poet select, arrange, and ulti- mately compose. Techniques of organization and the entire question of the legiti- macy of analogies between painting and poetry based upon them are a vast region for debate. We shall reluctantly forego detailed exploration here of analogous techniques - though we must, of course, refer to them from time to time - and direct our attention instead to but one aspect of the entire problem. We shall inquire into the psychological contents of landscape, noting how verbal description becomes a landscape, that is, a spatio-temporal struc- ture, and what such a structure expresses. In doing this, incidentally, we shall offer a theoretical rebuttal of the frequently encountered contention that, to use the words of Ortega, "preoccupation of the human content of the work is in principle incompatible with aes- thetic enjoyment proper."14 Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther (1774), justly famous for its lyrical enhancement of nature and for nature's role in mirroring a human soul as well as soothing it through its evocative power, may serve as an example of literary landscape. In his first letter (May 4, 1771), young Werther reports on the precious balm nature and landscape are to his heart. Every tree, every hedge is a nosegay, and one would like to turn into a cock- chafer to float in a sea of fragrance and find in it all the nourishment one needs. The town itself is not very agreeable, but it lies amidst the most inexpressible natural beauty, which led the late Count von M. to lay out a garden on one of the intersecting hills which form the most charming valleys in the loveliest diversity of Nature. The garden is simple, and one feels as soon as one enters that it was planned not by a scientific gardener but by an impressionable soul that wanted here to take its pleasure. I5 Werther's solitude is the accompaniment to this hymn to nature; however, it is not music which comes to his mind but painting: I could not draw a line at this moment, and yet I have never been more of a painter than I am now. When the mist is rising from the lovely valley and the sun is high above the impenetrable shade of my wood, so that only now and then a ray steals into the inner sanctuary, and I lie in the tall grass by the falling brook, and discover a thousand different grasses on the surface</page><page sequence="8">LITERARY PICTORIALISM 203 of the earth; when I feel nearer to my heart the teeming little world among the blades, the innumerable, unfathomable creatures in the shape of worms and insects, and when I feel the presence of the Almighty Spirit Who created us all in His image .... I am often consumed with longing and think, Ah! would that I could express it, would that I could breathe on to paper that which lives so warm and full within me, so that it might become the mirror of my soul as my soul is the mirror of the eternal God! My friend - but it is beyond my power, and I succumb to the splendor of what lies before me. 16 The next letter, written a few days later, begins with the rather strange confession: I do not know whether deluding spirits are hovering round this spot, or whether it is the divine and ardent fancy of my heart which turns everything round me into a Paradise.1 7 Although Werther sounds disconcertingly like a self-conscious sophisticate, he is nonetheless intended to be genuine in his emo- tions, just as his emotions are intentionally transparent to the reader. His feeling of oneness with nature, whether narcisisstic or not, does raise the question of what he is looking at and describing for his correspondent and the reader. Before answering, we may quote the next ten lines of this second letter. Right in front of the gate is a spring, a spring by which I am enchanted like Melusine and her sisters. On descending a small hill you come to an arch, with about twenty steps going down to where the clearest of water gushes from the marble rock. The little wall above, which encloses it, the tall trees all round, the coolness of the place - there is something so attractive, so awesome about it all. Hardly a day passes without my sitting there for an hour. 18 These passages from the beginning of the novel do not fully cover Werther's world of nature, his varying reactions to it, and the remarkable similarities this romantic egotist bears to the con- temporary English gentleman with a Claude glass in his hand and a pictorial intention in his breast. But they offer at least considerable evidence that his idealized and generic landscapes are something more than effusions of European pre-romanticism's best known character. To enumerate the features of this landscape and Werther's atti- tude (in a double sense) is to describe a literary historical phenome- non, a locus amoenus. Having rejected town for country, Werther turns first to a prospect of hills and dales, sunshine and shadow, then to the nearer view of the forest glade, an inner sanctuary with its cascading stream and his own reclining figure in the high grass, musing - or in this instance of anti-sublimity observing God's teeming little world. The entire setting is a simple garden (simple, that is to say, in eighteenth-century terms) with its decaying pa- vilion, and it is presumably intended as a mild contrast when Werther almost immediately afterwards offers us the idyllic</page><page sequence="9">204 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES picture of a marble spring enclosed by a wall and surrounded by trees, that cool spot outside the gates where village girls gather and where he spends his daily hour as observer of the scene. Werther's bower of bliss and the surrounding natural features are, of course, a typical eighteenth-century version of nature. The main feature of this gardenscape is the ability of the objects per- ceived to appear in a pattern (actually, the term G estait [profile] is preferable here) congruent with the emotion of the observer. We are quite ready to believe Werther 's malerische Empfindungen, to which reference is made several times in the novel; but at the same time we are aware that his pictorialism is so generic as to place nature in the category of topos: an ideal landscape is de- scribed which fits perfectly the psychological needs of the viewer. We are dealing here with more than a pre-romantic Naturgefuhl with all the excesses of an approaching Sturm und Drang; there is actual visualization and hence a rather clear instance of literary pictorialism, but it is habitual. Werther responds to landscape not as chaotic nature but as organized composition (overorganized, as we have seen, and hence more or less a visual cliché). For the reader, the setting is so familiar that a minimum of cues is required to make it appear as an integrated pattern, a picture. And our visual memory is appealed to at the psychological level: we are in effect given words in close correspondence with the schemata of visual art. This is composed nature. What are the psycho- logical contents of Werther's little nature scenes? The vast literature on this subject points to anthropomorphism, to the Rousseau nature cult, to the symbolism of the work, etc. And psychological contents are seen, plausibly enough, in terms of the character of Werther, or occasionally of the young Goethe himself. We are reluctant to assign so narrowly. Confronted with the usual triad of town, amiable nature as park, garden, enclosed meadows, finally a distant prospect of mountains and wilder nature, Werther re- enacts the pastoral flight to the countryside. The term'sanctuary' (das inner e Heiligtum) and altogether the blatant use of nature as soul-mirror reveal the theme of a return to nature as to a natural state, the return to a divinely inspired simplicity (God's teeming little world). His locus amoenus, while containing the charms as- sociated traditionally with this type of ideal landscape - Ernst Robert Curtius has written authoritatively on the subject in his European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages - introduces ad- ditionally the theme of sentimental melancholy so typical of the age. A simple garden, planned by a feeling heart and containing that ruined summer house in which Werther can shed a tear in memory of the deceased owner. The little scene is rounded off by Werther's remark, a triumphant one, that he will soon be master</page><page sequence="10">LITERARY PICTORIALISM 205 of the garden, "der Herr vom Garten," a symbolic expropriation of landscape with its decaying reminders of the past. The brief, habitual scene at the spring outside the town gates is a bit of genre painting, an extension of life into the world of nature outside. Here, too, Werther is the feeling observer, able to endow this bit of landscape with memory - he is reminded of olden times when patriarchs gathered at such a spring and carried on their daily affairs. As for the larger landscape outside the park and the village idyll at the spring, it is viewed in precisely the same manner as later Ro- mantics such as Eichendorff saw it: from a commanding height, from the terrace or window of a popular Wirtshaus or from some solitary vantage point. Such a commanding prospect is found at a later point in the novel. Werther's world (i.e., his present state of mind) is now a torment, whereas formerly nature had made his world into a paradise. What he now describes is the landscape of memory - a Wordsworthian scene from such an early poem as Tin- tern Abbey, which remembers that the colors and forms of nature were an appetite in youth, a feeling and a love - and it is this which sustains him in his misery. When I used to stand upon the rock and survey the fertile valley across the river as far as the distant hills, when I saw everything about me surge forth and germinate, the mountains clad thickly from foot to summit with tall trees, all the vales in their manifold windings shaded by the most delightful forests, with the river flowing gently among the whispering reeds, mirroring the clouds which were wafted along by the gentle evening breeze; when I heard the birds awakening in the forest .... now I took all this into my ardent heart, lost myself in its unending abundance, while the glorious forms of the unending world stirred within my animated soul. Vast moun- tains surrounded me, precipices lay at my feet, torrents poured down, rivers streamed below me, and forest and hills resounded.19 Werther's technique of verbal description - we ought, of course, to say Goethe's - needs little additional comment.. What we read is so general that our memory of the visible world can be mobilized without effort and projected into the words. For this, too, is an ideal landscape into which feelings, moral and philosophical re- flections, memory, thoughts of the Geist des Ewigschaffenden are poured - in short, everything that fancy and imagination choose to dredge up. Let us make the case more directly for psychology. We have said that an ideal landscape will fit the emotional needs of the viewer. Werther is looking at nature as a work of art, of divine art, to be sure, but one which must be seen "from above," that is to say with a grasp of the total organization or, to recall Langer's words, the underlying structures. The three types of landscape en- countered in this novel are so arranged as to move the observer</page><page sequence="11">206 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES away from the turmoil of civilization into an environment favor- able to his needs. What began in antiquity as the haven for satis- faction of basic needs becomes in an age of sentimentality the balm for injured souls; but the essential notion of refuge is still intact. We have already indicated that Werther's refuge lies between town and open nature and that his enclosure is, as it were, taken over from a kindred, departed spirit. Occurrences of the word "paradise" are usually linked to protective enclosures, which in turn may be combined with memory and with reflections on Man's finite place in the larger order. The refuge image is repeated throughout the novel. Werther's letter of May 26th describes a place with the suggestive name of Wahlheim: It is very interestingly situated on a hill and, when you walk out of the vil- lage by the footpath above, you see the whole village spread out at your feet.20 The prospect from this hill is not described, however, for Wer- ther's interest is exclusively the little square in front of the church where, beneath two spreading linden trees, he has table and chair placed. In the enclosure created by church, farmhouses and yards, and canopied over by branches, he sits reading Homer and looking out on the village. To see without being seen (this is a more figurative sense but nonetheless a basic need) and thereby both to enjoy landscape aesthetically and to render it familiar, destroying what is unknown in it, is to appropriate the world. This is, in a broad, symbolic sense, what Werther does. All of his prospects, breathtakingly majestic or tamely pastoral, are views of a world he never really sees - but then, as Samuel Monk remarks in his book on the sub- lime, eighteenth-century Man scarcely saw nature at all21 - and all his little enclosures, safely to one side but never fully removed from Man, are repeated gestures of self-assertion. This, we believe, is the animating force in the nature descriptions that take such a prominent place in Goethe's novel. Like a wounded yet still terri- torially aggressive animal (an unflattering image, though we think it fair), Werther seeks or creates his refuge on the margin of society, in that middle area between town and country, symbolically repre- sented by park or garden. His excursions from this refuge are in both directions, back to society and town, which will cause his renewed downfall, and out into nature, which he expropriates by rendering harmless: distant prospects with lovely valleys, charming copses, refreshing meadows, most endearing sunrises, and the like. The aesthetic appeal of this landscape, which is always experienced as visual, as a view of something from a safe spot, is of course only partly conscious anthropomorphism. It is more than possible that</page><page sequence="12">LITERARY PICTORIALISM 207 Werther 's place of the heart's desire is back in the womb of Mother Nature. Prospect and refuge are so interwoven and the sense of hazards and of bold appropriation so unpredictable in Werther that pictorial expression of this world becomes almost exclusively symbolic. This combination has often been observed, rather recently for example by Kenneth Clark in his book Landscape into Art: "Ideal landscape is closely connected with the landscape of symbols. Both were in- spired by a dream of the earthly paradise, both sought to create a harmony between man and nature."22 From this brief and summarizing view of Goethe's novel, let us draw some tentative conclusions and proceed to a few further generalizations about landscape. In ideal landscape especially, we have clear confirmation that associative impressions are of equal or greater import than direct ones. Among the associative impressions we reckon both memory and psychic make-up, and these, we have been attempting to show, are the foundations upon which the aes- thetic enjoyment of landscape rests. Man's symbolizing faculty may of course be understood as both conscious and unconscious. We have spoken already of the Picturesque as a conscious, indeed self-conscious mode of vision; and perhaps Wylie Sypher is right in reducing Pic- turesque to technique (and Symbolism to an extension of it) rather than seeing it as a style - which is to say that it is intentionally ac- quired, a developed taste. And Sypher goes on to explain: The technique of this picturesque-romantic-symbolist tradition is to suggest rather than to state; the artist in this tradition has a psychology instead of a style, and he often refuses the world outside, using it only to evoke certain feelings. Wordsworth believed that the process of writing his own poetry was evoked by a complex of feelings.23 Our point about landscape has been that all its traditions - not merely the picturesque-romantic-symbolist - are fundamentally psychological in that they not only evoke but indeed are them- selves produced by complexes of feeling. Ideal landscape as a type merely reminds us that the purely visual appeal is in inverse ratio to the coherence and identifiability of the object of perception, whether as artistic composition or as a piece of nature. Identity means that the sum of memory and imagination fuses with the per- ceived object. Or, as Leo Steinberg titles one of his theoretical studies, "The Eye is a Part of the Mind." Landscapes in nature, in painting, and in literature. are so burdened with extrinsic content that they present us with what a nineteenth-century aesthetician, Gustav Fechner, called an inexhaustibility. And ninety-nine years later, the remark is still not dated: The totality of memories and mental images asserts itself in its fusion with the sensory object and its immediate relationships as a total impression of landscape ....</page><page sequence="13">208 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Who would propose to trace, exhaust, explain all the notions (Vorstel- lungen) that contributed to it? Even the individual object possesses a certain inexhaustibility in this regard. Landscape offers us so to say an inexhaustibility of such objects, which interpenetrate one another in- definitely with their fields of association. 24 There remain in our somewhat conservative list three further basic landscape types: the landscape of fantasy, realistic land- scape, and the savage or wild landscape. The order is random; moreover, one might well effect a reduction in number by in- cluding fantasy in the ideal landscape and the savage in the realistic. But not always, and not necessarily. Or one might equally well multiply the number by pointing to the existence of mixed forms whose prevalence in painting and literature suggests an im- portance exceeding that of the four types we mention here as basic. But time does not permit and our argument does not re- quire this kind of completeness, for in the face of our assertion that involvement in landscape is of a magnitude to render im- possible or at least meaningless what one might, in a borrowed phrase, call the unmediated vision (that is to say, bare scenic sur- faces, word-painting) any seriatim discussion of types would neces- sarily be repetitious. One observes, for example, that many so- called wild or otherwise hostile landscapes in literature are there for the sake of their opposites, so that an effective tension or con- trast is created to pastoral, to the domesticated landscape, etc. Savage landscapes often point to the haven or refuge alongside or within them (as with Stifter or Raabe, to mention two further German pictorial writers). And the literature of fairy tale (in which landscape is generally subordinate to story-line) or of ro- mance (in which imagination is primary and its fantastic pano- ramas highly symbolic) operates almost exclusively within the context of prospect (the adventure, setting out), hazard (the tasks and dangers during the quest), and refuge (the balance at- tained or restored and made to comprise the happy ending). Tolkien's massive trilogy contains numerous instances of all landscape types in virtually all possible combinations. Pioneer and regional fiction, finally, as examples of factual or realistic land- scape - from James Fenimore Cooper to the picturesque scenes of Sara Orne Jewett and the prairie landscapes of Rôlvaag - often suggest a fidelity to the visual and to landscape as a thing separate from Man, but here, too, underlying attitudes are so decisive as to make this type perhaps most representative of our argument for landscape ^s psychological phenomenon.

Feelings for nature, by which we mean attitudes to land (positive and negative), precede and therefore always ac- company representations of both nature and landscape. As we read in a recent study of Matthew Arnold's poetic land- scapes, All poets of landscape must face the problem of uniting natural description with human significance if they wish to write something more than country contentments in verse .... There are as large variations in the naturalism of the description as there are in the humanity of the significance. 26 What is wrong with this statement is simply that the uniting of description and significance (or reflection and description) is not so much a problem as it is inevitable. And to insist on large varia- tions in both leads to excessive stress, in the critic we are quoting, on the theory that "ihere are no varieties of landscape poetry, but only various landscape poems."27 We believe, on the contrary, that the universals count more than the particulars. Essential con- tent, we have been saying, is more important to understanding landscape than any number of painterly examples; and by content we understand the visual field, the piece of nature composed, sub- jected, that is, to human expression. In defense of realism in art, we recall that Champfleury always stressed sincerity, by which he meant guarding the integrity of vision against the distortions of convention and preconceptions. It is easy to appreciate such a sentiment, but in effect when Champfleury writes of integrity of vision, of representing in art only what the artist sees or experiences, he realizes (and indeed elsewhere openly states) that "the reproduction of nature by man will never be a reproduction and imitation, but always an interpre- tatioa"28 To realize just how true this is we need merely recall that the intense visualization of the Impressionists is the most subjective of all art movements. Gombrich, among many others, has pointed out that their triumph of objective truth is really the opposite: It is the point of impressionist painting that the direction of the brushstroke is no longer an aid to the reading of forms. It is without any support from structure that the beholder must mobilize his memory of the visible world and project it into the mosaic of strokes and dabs on the canvas before him.29 The key words here, memory and projection, have been at the heart of our discussion. What they really contribute is not any- thing quite so simple as a "reading of feelings, etc. into the work" but rather the underlying structures themselves. Just as the two- dimensional art of painting depends in pictorial representation</page><page sequence="15">210 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES on the visual concept of the three-dimensional object - we need no psychologist to tell us that our organism is attuned strictly to a three-dimensional world - so do the poet and the poet's reader bring in attitudes, associations, above all the memory of three- dimensional structures.30 This would be our answer to Lessing and our explanation of Burke 's effect of things. If landscape depiction and landscape description ultimately depend upon the same conceptual struc- tures, does it follow that the one will be superior to the other? Space and time, and action (movement) and the static in space are neither mutually exclusive in art nor amenable to a pecking order of appropriateness. A verbal landscape is the translation or rendition of a visual composition (within a fiction or not, it does not matter) into a language code, which in turn is translated by the reader into a spatial experience. As a composition is created (or recreated by the reader), two processes are, as it were, simul- taneously involved. The first, a piling up of words in succession - a clear instance of Lessing's temporality - is merely part of the process of "seeing" (experiencing) the composition, and has not detained us as it detained Lessing. The second process is the cru- cial one: the experience of the composition as a unity. Such a unity must be spatial in the sense that it must be present in the mind as a simultaneous thing - not in all its details but in its virtual structure. This is just as true of a symphony as of a poem in that the whole must be grasped as one grasps the composition of a painting. Since simultaneity is required rather than temporality, one speaks of spatial structure, by which is meant an organized, comprehended pattern.31 At which point we come full circle. Technically, that pattern, which is gradually uncovered but which suggests itself from the outset through a series of topoi or thematic symbols, remains non- visual. Lessing is really complaining that a word-picture of nature cannot come as close to its subject as a painted picture. A picture is worth a thousand words. Unless we are called upon, let us say, to picture that seven-word sentence. Or unless of course we are concerned with universals rather than particulars. And unless our subject (matter) is landscape and the causes for our aesthetic enjoyment of it. And then we recall that verbal symbolism, which admittedly has a general reference and thus does not really repre- sent one single object, one single landscape, finds its closest ally in the schemata of painting.32 For painting, too, must use sym- bolic language if it is to have multiple meanings. And this is the final aim of literary pictorialism as it concerns landscape: not bare surfaces but meanings, meanings which a psychology of art may read out and a Wordsworth into a composed piece of nature.</page><page sequence="16">LITERARY PICTORIALISM 21 1 Psychologically, we conclude, landscapes in painting and in poetry coincide in their basic attitudes, which are expressed through a surprisingly limited range of basic images. These images are constants of human behavior. In our way of examin- ing things, nature moves to the category of landscape as it is seen; for seeing is composition, which is the poetic process. Where might one turn next in seeking deeper understanding of landscape? To the particulars, of course, the individual examples which can confirm or emend the basic symbols or situations we have pointed to in a rather obvious eighteenth-century novel. But also to a closer examination of actual techniques of composition (scanning, framing, focusing, distorting, etc.).33 Such an approach - one calls it object-oriented - represents a logical supplement to the process-orientation we have been discussing: Man's experience of the landscape. Much research remains to be done in both, and above all in the ways in which they come together. E.
