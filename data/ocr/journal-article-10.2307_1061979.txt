Ochsenschlager T H E CO S M I C SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PLEMOCHOE In a recent article1 the author has attempted to show that a cer- tain vessel found at the Egyptian site of Thmuis2 in a context clearly dated to the first half of the second century B.C., or slightly later, is most likely an example of the plemochoe. This vessel is of unusual religious interest, for two plemochoai were used in the ritual at Eleusis and gave their name to the last day of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Athenaeus (11.496b) gives us the most complete account of the vessel and its use: "Plemochoe, a ceramic dish like a whirling top sitting at rest, which some speak of as a little kotulos. They make use of it [ = kotyliskos] in Eleusis on the last day of the mysteries which they name from it Plemochoai, on which day, after they Work on this article was made possible by a summer research grant from the City University of New York. Special thanks are also due to Professor LeRoy Campbell of Brooklyn College, to whom I am indebted for many suggestions and valuable criticism. 1 Edward L. Ochsenschlager, "The Plemochoe, a Vessel from Thmuis," Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt (henceforth JARCE) 7 (1968): 55-71. 2 The Mendes Expedition of the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University, with the support of the Brooklyn Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, and, beginning next season, Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, is excavating two mounds in the Delta of Egypt under the direction of Professor Donald P. Hansen. One of these mounds was an important Graeco-Roman city in antiquity known to the Greeks as Thmuis; the other is the ancient Egyptian city called Mendes by the Greeks. See JARCE 6 (1967):35-37 for a description of the room in which the vessel was found and the reasoning behind our tentative dating, and pp. 48-51, and pl. 22, figs. 42 and 43 for a brief catalog of the accompanying finds.

The author of the Peirithus, whether he is Kritias the Tyrant or Euripides, makes mention of them [= plemochoai] by saying the following: 'That we may pour out these plemochoai into the earthy chasm with propitious speech."' The information from Pollux (Onom. 10.73-74) is somewhat less precise: "Hence the hydria would be a vessel not only for water but also for wine, which one may also call a phenaknis and phidaknis, as in the Demiopratoi, but frequently also a plemochoe. It is a ceramic vessel not having a sharp bottom but on the con- trary is sitting and stationary, which they use on the last day of the mysteries, which day they name from it Plemochoe; but included in these is also a psykter." Pollux only partially quotes or interprets the Athenaeus data. He gives us no clue as to the way the vessel was used and tells us, incorrectly, that the last day of the Mysteries was called Plemochoe. The statement of Athenaeus that it was called Plemochoai is born out by Hesychius (s.v.) and by the nature of the ritual which in- volved the use of two vessels. On the other hand, Pollux does make a valuable addition to our knowledge by telling us that the vessel was used in his time both for water and for wine. From the name of the vessel, one can deduce that it was origi- nally designed to contain water. The word h7TA-%toX08 comes from TAXrij , denoting a "flooding or flowing of water" or "flood-tide," and X'r, something that pours (XEcc). It seems clear that water was poured from the plemochoe, in its use in the Eleusinian Mysteries, since wine was taboo in the rites of Demeter.3 It is impossible to learn much about this vessel through the identification of its ancient name alone. Such an identification has a certain utility in assuring a modern classification of the vessel corresponding to the way it was classified by an ancient Greek, but it is only when an artifact can be identified with contemporary ideas or beliefs about it that it can have true diagnostic or inter- pretive value. The problem is, as a review of the literature on the Eleusinian Mysteries confirms, that practically nothing is known about the significance of the plemochoai ritual; and therefore, when one has identified this vessel as the plemochoe, one has done little more than label it a "ritual vessel used in the Eleusinian Mysteries." 3 Hymn. Hom. Cer., 206-9. 317</page><page sequence="3">Cosmic Significance of the Plemochoe A pot is the product of a complex series of ideas, drives, and factors. In the case of a ritual vessel such as the plemochoe, which was apparently used through many centuries of religious ritual, the complexity would undoubtedly prove overwhelming even if we were furnished with the texts of detailed and comprehensive analyses by a variety of ancient authors living at different periods of time. To attempt, then, to elicit such complex information as the specific significance of the plemochoe at any given time would be totally unrealistic in terms of the evidence that has survived from antiquity. Even if we cannot hope to recover the vessel's specific signifi- cance in all its complexity, at any given epoch, we can still learn much about its use and meaning. It is apparent that Greek reli- gion, like all ancient religions, is based on a knowledge of the devine derived from cosmic events. If, then, we can come to understand the cosmic significance of the plemochoe, we would possess the central and basic core around which the changing ideas and aspirations of different epochs gathered and with which they interacted. Although this approach can not tell us all that we would like to know, it tells us much more than we know now. It firmly anchors the ritual we are studying to a particular type of religious experience and reveals its basic structure. Such a study has the added advantage of being able to make use of all the evidence, from whatever period it originates, insofar as it illuminates the cosmic basis of the particular religious experi- ence. Then too, because impressive or important cosmic events or manifestations are limited in number, one is apt to find an abun- dance of comparative material in other rites, and indeed in other cultures. One should of course be cautious in the use of this com- parative material, especially so in the case of non-Greek data. Comparisons from other religions and other cultures can be most useful in illuminating the basic significance involved if one does not forget that in different approaches to the same cosmic pheno- menon there can be remarkable quantitative and qualitative differences. There is certainly no reason to think that the use of the plemo- choe need be limited to the Demeter ritual;4 indeed, the statement 4 It seems improbable that we are excavating an Eleusinian at Thmuis, although one apparently existed at nearby Alexandria (G. Mylonas, Eleusis and the Eleu- sinian Mysteries [Princeton, N.J., 1961], p. 300). Further excavation will be necessary before the mudbrick structure from which the plemochoe came can be accurately identified. 318</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions of Pollux that it was used both for water and for wine would seem to indicate more than one use for the vase. Nor does the quotation from the Peirithus5 preclude other uses. Although the words are fitting for the Eleusinian rites, we do not know in what context they were spoken in the play, and in its present form the formula is equally suitable for other chthonian cults and funerary libations. The plemochoe may well have been used both in the ritual of other deities and in private funerary or fertility ritual. POSSIBLE USE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 'PLEMOCHOE" IN FUNERARY RITUAL In funeral rites a single plemochoe could have been used for pouring a libation for the life and productivity that come from the dead, or chthonic psyche. Cults of the dead and of the underworld are both closely linked with fertility rites, as the abundance of the earth was believed to come up from benevolent spirits below. According to the Hippocratic Corpus (Insomn. 2.14), "From the dead come food and increase and seeds," and a fragment from Aristophanes (Tagenist, fr. 488, 13) recalls that: "When a man dies we all begin to say / The sainted one has passed away, has fallen asleep, / Blessed therein that he is vexed no more. / Yes, and with holy offerings we sacrifice to them as gods and pour libations, / Bidding them send good things up from below. /" No wonder it was customary at Athens to strew seeds of all kinds over a newly made grave,6 thus placing them under the protection of the souls of the dead who inhabit the earth. On the fifth of Boedromion, at the autumn equinox, a public feast called the Genesia7 was held at Athens for all the dead. Although Farnell8 believes it to be "a ritual of sorrow performed by the yevir or clans in honor of the ancestors, who are called by the generic name yovels," the evidence from Herodotus (4.26) indicates that it was a yearly ritual performed by the son on his dead father's birthday, and this would connect the rite more naturally with the concept of genesis. Probably the Genesia should be associated with both the Hellenic view of immortality through 5 See page 317, above. 6 Isigonus (Miiller), Mir. 67; Cic., Leg. 2.302 f. 7 Hesych., s.v. yeveata; Anecd.

Then too, it was customary for each Attic phratry to sacrifice to their Tritopatores, a vaguely related group of ancestral fathers; but we also hear that the Athenians prayed to them at marriage ceremonies for the gift of children.10 Surely then, the panspermia offered at graves on the third day (Chytroi) of the Anthesteria was presented for the blessing and generative action of the dead in the underworld, the birthplace and home of Ploutos who was an aspect of Pluto-Hades, and was intended to result in an abundance of life and growth in the upper world. It is interesting to note in this connection that the very words for the nourishment of the im- mortals, nectar, from VEKpo'W, and ambrosia, the elixir of life, from a-liflporos (&lt; a tpoTvs, Lat. mortuus), have something of death in them. The idea of the generative potential of the dead seems to have arisen out of a negative attitude toward them.l1 Departed members of the household, especially the former "fathers," must be kept pacified in order to lay their ghosts and turn them into agathoi daemones. Development of the idea that ghosts can send blessings as well as curses was the product of evolving thought which developed the idea of positive values,12 and paralleled the slow social evolution from the acquisition of goods to the production of goods. Eventually ghosts can produce good things as well as prevent their acquisition. They become benefactors rather than potential enemies and if properly approached, they promote and intensify life. The potency of the family ghosts becomes fused with old agricultural fertility powers in an invisible community or kingdom-the reflection of an agricultural society having kings and queens. The latter become gods of fertility whose offspring is 9 As Plato tells us in the Symposium 207: "The mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and immortal; and this is only to be attained by generation because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old. Nay, even in the life of the same individual there is succession and not absolute unity." 10 Phot., s.v. TpLT0oTrcopes; by the Classical period, a least, these had developed into spirits of the wind (Hesych. s.v.), perhaps under Orphic influence. Aristotle mentions (De An. 1.5) that the Orphics held that the soul entered the human body, "borne by the winds." Furthermore, we learn in the Geoponica (9.3) that winds give rise to plants and everything else. For the relationship between water and winds, see p. 329, and n. 74, below. 11 Note, for instance, the name and ritual of the ve'cnaLa for the dead (Anecd. Bekk. 232.1.32; Dem. p. 1031) and the fear of taint of ghostly presence in certain parts of the festival of the Anthesteria (Phot., s.v.

Persephone also "dies" in order to be- come the mother of all life. As Onians has pointed out,13 "the characteristic offerings to the dead were in fact 'pourings' (Xoai)." In lists of such offerings we always find both wine and water14 as well as other liquids such as honey, oil, honey mixture, and barley groats, all of which could be poured from the plemochoe, although they are not specifically mentioned as its proper contents by our authorities. It seems likely that water was the first substance of libation and that its use was based on the concept of water as a first principle, an idea rooted in life experience. Sky water, or rain, appears to generate life, and life itself is liquid, moist and sappy. Why then should water not be efficacious for the desiccated dead who, as "De- meter's people," 15 share a certain kinship with the seeds that rest in the bosom of the earth? In the Odyssey (6.201), &amp;Eepos (&amp;Lalvc) fporos apparently means "living mortal," and Plato (Theaet 180D)16 recalls that the idea of water as the origin of all things was a common belief of the ancients. Indeed, water seems to have played a prominent role, both in Greek cosmologies17 and in early Greek philosophy. Thales claimed that water was the primary substance from which all else developed and that the earth rested upon water,18 while Anaximander believed that the surface of the earth was originally liquid19 and that the first living creatures from which men evolved were engendered in liquid and developed in husks from which they later emerged.20 Later, Heraclitus (Aetius 4.3.12 in Diels, Dox. Graec.) taught that the psyche of the universe was exhalation or vapor from the liquid in it. Archelaus thought water melted by heat produced earth surrounded by air, and that living creatures were produced by the heat of the earth that cast up a milklike slime for food.21 Theophrastos (Diog. Laert. 9.21.22) 13 R.

Bachofen, Das Mutterrecht (Basel, 1954), pp. 233 ff. 321</page><page sequence="7">Cosmic Significance of the Plemochoe believed that men's genesis first arose from slime, as did heat and cold, from which all things are compounded. Apparently the con- cept of the primacy of liquid persisted into the Christian period. We learn from the New Testament (John 3:5-6): "Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the king- dom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit." It is obvious here that the phrase "born of water" is synonymous with "of the flesh." Just as beliefs about the dead changed, so probably did the concept of appropriate liquid offerings to them. It seems likely that the more-complicated liquids became popular in ritual, eventually rivaling and sometimes replacing the older and more elemental water, as the agriculture and technology which pro- duced them evolved. In this connection it should be noted that anything with unusually pleasing qualities was likely to be regarded as divine in ancient times. The extraordinary was the essence of divinity as it was of magic. The exact purpose which the funerary use of liquid in historical times was thought to serve is not clear. Onians, in his excellent discussion of libations to the dead,22 concentrates on the concept of the restoration of the life fluid or the principia vitae to the desiccated dead. Whether liquid served the dead as an imagined relief from their suffering, a necessity for their elemental existence or well being, a stimulation to generation, an agent for the recon- stitution of form, or a catalyst to the rebirth of souls, is unclear. It would undoubtedly depend on the rationalization of the individual, complicated by various beliefs in the transmigration of souls or an elysian existence after death. Essentially, however, libations must have been a traditional form in fifth-century Athens and later, like the funerary banquets, the grave blankets, the gifts of flowers, and the pebbles placed on tombstones to record visits, characteristic of funerary practice in certain parts of the United States. For the ordinary, intelligent Greek in later antiquity, these customary pourings must have been as hard to reconcile with his basic beliefs as are the latter with modern Christianity and Judaism. The pouring out of water or other fluid for life and productivity from below, parallels ingestion of vital liquid for personal produc- tivity and regeneration of the soul within the body. Among the substances mentioned as libations in funerary ritual are barley 22 See R. Onians (n. 13, above), pp. 271-91. See also E. Rohde, Psyche (London, 1950), pp. 575-76, n. 151. 322</page><page sequence="8">History of Religions groats,23 which are essentially the same as the kykeon. The latter was apparently drunk or eaten in the Mysteries, possibly in the vessel known as the simple kernos, as a symbol of revitalization or soul rebirth into a new state of health and strength. Furthermore we know that the custom of pouring libations to the dead is inex- tricably bound up with man's observation of the "miracle" of the dormant and budding tree, the dry and germinating kernel. It is just such kernels that the kotylisks of the complex kernos were designed to hold. The interrelationship is especially interesting because all three vessels were used in the Eleusinian Mysteries, and because the resemblance between the plemochoe, the kotylisks of the complex kernos, and the simple kernos, which may have held the kykeon, is so striking.24 USE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE "PLEMOCHOE" IN THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES It has been suggested that the day Plemochoai in the Eleusinian Mysteries was devoted mainly to libations and rites for the dead,25 but such a suggestion does not account for the ritual placement of the plemochoai or the universal implications accorded the Mysteries by ancient authors. We are told that two vessels were used in the Mysteries. One was placed to the east, the traditional region of the rising sun and genesis, the other to the west, the traditional region of the setting sun, descent into the lower world, and phthora.26 The fact that the initiates in the Eleusinian Mysteries used their ceremonial garments for the clothing of newborn children after their return home27 certainly indicates an emphasis on fertility, birth, or health. This use of the garments must be viewed as a residual or epitomized emphasis on the basic significance of the rites as a whole. Likewise, the plemochoe ritual on the last day of the Mysteries was a summary emphasis on fertility or renewal of life. Neither the plemochoe rite nor the use of the telete garments was regarded as part of the secret mysteries themselves. 23 Od. 11.26 f. 24 See Ochsenschlager (n. 1, above). 25 See Mylonas (n. 4, above), p. 279. 26 i0op' was the common philosophical term for maturity and decay of life. The word apogenesis is substituted for phthora by Porphyrius or his sources, apparently to avoid emphasis on decay and to emphasize transition to another existence. 27 Schol., in Ar. Plut. 5.845 quoting Melanthios. In contrast, the candidates who had been initiated in the Lesser Mysteries continued to wear the garments of their initiation until they were worn out (IG, II2, 1672, 229). 323</page><page sequence="9">Cosmic Significance of the Plemochoe Apparently the overturning of the vessels was accompanied by a rhesis mystike. Long ago, Lenormant28 connected a certain formula preserved by Proklos and Hippolytus with the words spoken during the plemochoai rites. The connection of this formula with the plemochoe, rejected by some authorities29 and accepted by other,30 bears further examination. Proklos31 says that: "in the Eleusinian rites they gazed upward to the sky and cried aloud 'rain,' they gazed down upon the earth and cried 'conceive."' According to Hippolytus (MacMahon, Haer. 5.7) the Naassene author claimed that this formula was the great secret of the Mysteries, but this need not be taken too seriously in the context from which it comes. Hippolytus quotes out of context from the Naassene author in order to refute him with a heterogeneous mishmash of biblical quotations. Mylonas,32 the most recent authority to reject the association of this formula with the plemochoe rites, calls attention to an in- scription on the edge of a well by the Dipylon gate of Athens: "0 Pan, 0 Men be of good cheer, beautiful Nymphs, rain, con- ceive, super-conceive."33 He claims that the inscription forbids any connection with the cult of Demeter,34 because no one would have dared inscribe a secret of the Eleusinian Mysteries on a well open to public view and because the invocation to "Pan," "Men," and the "Nymphs" cannot be reconciled with the ritual of the Plemochoai.35 Neither of these reasons, it seems to me, is a valid one for cate- gorically excluding such a connection. First of all, the rites of the Plemochoai are not a part of the secret ritual of the telete or epopteia, 28 F. Lenormant, "Eleusinia," in Dictionnaire des antiquites grecques et ro- maines, ed. C. Daremberg and E. Saglio (henceforth DarSag) (Chicago, 1873- 1919), 2:573, n. 682. 29 For instance, P. Foucart, Les mysteres d'Eleusis (Paris, 1914), pp. 495-96, connects the formula with the Hieros Gamos; Mylonas (n. 4, above) concludes that it could not belong to the cult of Demeter at all; W. Otto, "The Meaning of the Eleusinian Mysteries," in Papers from the Eranos Yearbooks, vol. 2, The Mysteries, ed. J. Campbell (New York, 1955), p. 25, following L. Deubner, Attische Feste (Berlin 1932), p. 86, believes it formed part of the epopteia rites on the basis of the quotation from Hippolytus (see below). 30 For instance, J. Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, 3d ed. (Cambridge, 1922, reprinted New York, 1955), p. 161; A. Dieterich, Eine Mithras- liturgie (Berlin, 1903), p. 214. 31 Procl.

Second, we are dealing here with an extremely ancient formula, obviously derived from pretheistic magic and based upon an elemental and fundamental observation of natural phenomena made by men everywhere.36 If this simple formula was in any way a secret, and there are legitimate reasons for doubt about this, the secret must lie within some special symbolic value revealed to the initiate during the course of the rites and not within the obvious fertility significance of the formula itself. Thus its secret meaning, if any, would have been as hidden from the uninitiated in antiquity as it is from us today. The very elementality of the formula's fertility significance makes it especially suitable to the Eleusinian Mysteries, which like all mysteries, dealt essentially with simple, elemental things. It is the basic simplicity of these symbols which makes them especially suitable for expressing the fundamentals which their use in the mysteries is seeking to convey. According to Diodorus Siculus (5.4.4); "in the observance of the Eleusinian Mysteries they imitate the ancient manner of life." We are told by Cicero (De nat. deor. 1.42) that in the Eleusinia the "nature of things rather than of gods is recognized." Clement of Alexandria (Strom. 5.11) is even more explicit, for he says: "Quite appropriately the loutron begins the purifications of the mysteries among the Greeks just as among the barbarians. After this there are the Lesser Mysteries having a certain basis of in- struction and of preparation for things to follow, but the Greater Mysteries are still left, not to teach about the totality of things but to give a vision [epopteuein] and understanding [perinoein] about physical nature and its workings [physis and pragmata]." Other rites were as basic as the rites of the plemochoai. We hear, for instance, of a Balletus rite,37 a fertility ritual which harks back to the savage rite for averting famine by the slaying and burial of the pharmakos maiden under a mound of rocks, a parallel to the burial of maidens alive in the fields to make the soil produc- tive.38 Then too, a number of authors mention a Hieros Gamos, or Holy Marriage of the god and goddess represented by the Hiero- phant and a priestess.39 Although this is the most disputed part of 36 M. Eliade (Patterns in Comparative Religion [New York, 1958], p. 257) men- tions the formula and suggests that it was probably the primeval model of both fertility of the land and of human marriage. 37 Athen. 9.406d; Hesychius, s.v. 38 M.

A great deal of dispute about the Eleusinian rites has been caused by a failure to separate subordinate rites, enacted at the Kallichoron Spring or in the Plutonion and elsewhere, from the Teletai proper which were enacted in the Telesterion and had to do with the basic elements and nature of life. What has come down to us of the Epopteia, the most sacred and secret of all the ceremonies, is perhaps most elemental of all. According to Hippolytus (Haer. 5.8.39), "The Athenians perform the Eleusinia and show to the epoptai the great and marvelous and most perfect epoptic mystery: an ear of grain reaped in silence." This has been discounted on the grounds that it could scarcely be a secret since Demeter is shown with grain stalks on the monuments. But it must be recalled that the mysteries dealt with the nature of things and not with gods or theology. The "bread of life" or "the bread that came down from heaven" is found as a mystic element in the very Greek Gospel of John, this bread being the Son of God himself. It is not the ear alone that is the mystery, but also the reaping in silence and all the implica- tions that went with it. As Nilsson points out,41 the statement of Hippolytus "agrees exactly with the simple old agrarian character of the Eleusinian cult." Tertullian (Valent. 1) tells us that the male phallus also was a symbol shown to the epoptai: "Such a great divinity in the shrines, such an inspiration of the epoptai, such a seal of the tongue, an image of the membrum virile is revealed." This too has been doubted, but the revelations of the Mystery dealt with the elemental physis, or physical nature and generation of things. In a fertility cult which met the needs of a city population as well as farmers, the probability of the use of sex symbols must be ad- mitted.42 Nor should one forget that according to the Odyssey 40 See Mylonas pp. 99-100, 146-49 (n. 4, above), for description. 41 M. Nilsson, Greek Folk Religion (New York, 1961), p. 55. 42 A point emphasized by M. Nilsson, ibid., p. 44. See further the bathing act of Phryne (Athen. 13.39 or 590) and the interesting passage in Clement of Alexandria (Protrept. 169 ff.) which "tells how Demeter, wandering through Eleusis... in search of her daughter the Maiden, becomes exhausted and sits down at a well in deep distress.... But to continue, for I will not forbear to tell the rest of the story, Baubo, having received Deo as a guest, offers here a kukeon. She declines to take it, being unwilling to drink on account of her mourning, Baubo is deeply hurt, thinking she has been slighted, and thereupon uncovers her secret parts and exhibits them to the goddess. Deo is pleased at the sight and now at last receives 326</page><page sequence="12">History of Religions (5.125), Demeter lay with Iasion on the newly sown ground at the beginning of spring in a symbolic union for the promotion of fertility. The elemental quality of the Proklos formula assures us not only that it could easily find a place in the Eleusinian Mysteries, but also that it was probably widely used in other fertility cults and ritual. It comes as no surprise, then, to find it connected with Pan, Men, and the Nymphs. The Phrygian-Anatolian Men, a Lunar god of the Above (Anothen) and Below (Katothen), whose most common title Askainos or Askenos may denote the god of the Sky-tabernacle, or Sky-tent, became an attribute of Attis as Tyrannos in the mysteries of the Great Mother.43 In the company of Pan and the Nymphs he is probably represented in the aspect of the god below the Sky in the physical world of generation and decay. Pan, a generative daimon, connected at times with the worship of Demeter,44 would represent here that aspect of Men concerned with the lunatic power of growth in nature. He is the inter- mediary between sky and earth, a generative force like Eros who can be equated in physical terms with the generative rain.45 As Farnell has pointed out,46 the Nymphs, who shared a cave with Pan at the base of the Acropolis,47 stand for the productive powers of nature conceived of as feminine. In this respect they are comparable to Demeter-Persephone. Porphyrius (De antro. 18) tells us that "springs and streams are suitable to water nymphs and still more to nymphs that are souls, which likewise the an- cients used to call bees as workers of sweetness. For this reason Sophocles said of souls, not inappropriately, 'A swarm of dead buzz and come up.' The ancients also used to call the priestesses of Demeter, a chthonic goddess, mystic bees and Kore, bee-like, and the draft-delighted with the spectacle. These are the secret mysteries of the Athenians. These are also the subject of Orpheus' poems. I will quote you the very lines of Orpheus, in order that you may have the originator of the mysteries as witness of their shamelessness: 'This said, she drew aside her robes, and showed / A sight of shame; child Iacchos was there, / And laughing, plunged his hands below her breasts. And drank the draft from out the glancing cup.' /" These rites, and coarse jesting, we probably associated with the day Kallichoron and took place at the Kallichoron Spring. 43 P. Perdrizet, BCH 20 (1896): 55-106,figs. 1-7; Campbell(n. 16, above), pp. 148- 49 and n. 74, points out that Men probably corresponds to Zoroastrian Mah and Masda, the latter derived, perhaps, from an ancient Indo-European Masdes. 44 See Mitteilungen des deutschen Archdologischen Instituts, Athenische Abteilung (1896), p. 275; Harrison (n. 30, above), pp. 277-78. 45 See p. 334, and n. 85. 46 L.

Just what the Nymphs represented in terms of the nature of things is clearly stated by the Emperor Julian (To King Helios, 165D): "Myth says that when Attis passed beyond the limit [the Milky Way] and came to the lowest region, he descended into a cave and wedded the Nymph. But the Nymph is to be understood as the moisture of matter, and here it does not mean matter itself but the last im- material cause which subsists before matter." Actually, the whole ritual of the plemochoai could be transferred to the cult of Pan, Men, and the Nymphs as easily as the formula. Indeed there is no good reason why the plemochoe could not play a significant part in their worship. Water is poured from the plemochoe placed to the east in imitation of the fertilizing or generative rain that falls from the sky and impregnates the earth.48 The rite of the plemochoe is apparently as ancient and elemental in origin as the formula that accompanies it, and a prime example of the survival of imitative magic.49 Water is again poured from the plemochoe which represents the earth-chasm and is located toward the west, probably to emphasize Mother Earth as the receiver of the life-producing waters of the sky who also sends up life from below. Men would be associated with the plemochoe to the east, the Nymphs with the vessel to the west, while Pan served to represent all forms of physical life, which combines powers from above and below. The invisible world below both receives (from above) and returns (in productivity).50 In the Eleusinian Mysteries there is difficulty in making such exact personalized or anthropomorphized assignments because we are dealing with a typical Indo-European, dynamistic, fertility 48 The concept of the generative power of rain is amply documented from antiquity. See Onians (n. 13, above), p. 230, n. 8, and pp. 288-89 on rainwater regarded by the Greeks as seed; A. Cook, Zeus (Cambridge, 1940), 3:452-54 on rain as the seed of Zeus, the burning Sky, which impregnates Mother Earth, and pp. 473-76 on the significance of the golden rain in the myth of Danae as a mythi- cal expression for the fertilizing showers of the sky god; cf. Euripedes Chrysippos (frag. 839, Nauck). 49 W. Robertson Smith (Lectures on the Religion of the Semites [Cambridge, 1889; reprinted New York, 1956, p. 23] and nn. 2 and 3) points out that it is a common belief all over the world that pouring water is a potent rain charm. As Professor Jonathan Smith has indicated, in a private communication, it seems fairly certain that similar beliefs were the basis for the Simhath beth hashoebah celebrated on the seventh day of the Feast of the Tabernacles in the Temple at Jerusalem and the ritual described by Lucian in Dea Syria 13.

Receiving and Giving." 328</page><page sequence="14">History of Religions cult on which morphism has been incompletely imposed.51 Luckily the basic dynamistic concept has been preserved in myth, literature, and art. In a fragment of Aeschylus (fr. 44 Nauck)52 Aphrodite says: "The holy heaven yearns to wound the earth, and yearning layeth hold on the earth to join in wedlock; the rain, fallen from the amorous heaven, impregnates the earth, and it bringeth forth for mankind the food of flocks and herds and Demeter's gifts; and from that moist marriage-rite the woods put on their bloom. Of all these things I am the cause." Cook53 explains that the Europa and bull myth of Gortyna points to a sky and earth marriage, and Pausanius (1.24.3) recalls an image of Earth praying to Zeus to rain on her which stood on the Acropolis at Athens. From the pseudo Aristotle (De plantis 817a. 28-29) we learn that "the earth is the mother of growing things, while the sun is their father." The substitution of the sun for Zeus is probably the result of the transfer of the sky god's attributes to, and an amalgamation of the Supreme Being with, the sun god,54 as well as a statement of the generative cycle in which both moisture and heat were important.55 The Romans too were familiar with the idea. We hear from Lucretius (1.250-2) that "lastly, raindrops disappear when Father Ether casts them down into the lap of Mother Earth. But luxuriant crops spring up," and Virgil (Georg. 2.324-7) tells us that "In the spring the earth swells warm and implores the fruitful seeds. Then will the omnipotent Father Ether descend in fertilizing rain into the lap of his joyful wife, and, mingling mightily with her vast body, bring forth all great things." 51 The incomplete imposition of morphism in the Eleusinian Mysteries is clearly indicated by its confused genealogies. Is the begatter of the Child, for instance, the Olympian Zeus, or Poseidon, or Hades (called Zeus Chthonios), or a Rain-God-of- the-Year variously named? Is the offspring a Daughter (the young barley shoot), or a Son (the new barley seed or the vitality in the seed)? Is the Child Persephone- Kore, or Ploutos-Kouros? Zeus, Poseidon, and Dionysus were closely identified with rainwater, or sap, and the Spartan Hades was a god of grain (as shown on cult reliefs). All four were closely connected with the Eleusinian Mysteries of the Two Goddesses, as well as an unnamed Theos. The absorption of the Aegean Male God, who dies and is reborn annually, into the Olympian Zeus or Poseidon, was never successfully completed, but remained one part of the Greek Chthonic Mysteries. Not only does the Daughter become the Mother by the same Male Consort, according to Clement of Alexandria (Protr. 13P), but the Son also becomes the Consort and Father by the same Mother. 52 Translation of W.

Of these the one is Father be- cause of the out-pourings of spermatic water, but the other a Mother because of receiving the same and giving birth." SKY AND EARTH VESSELS One might surmise, then, that the eastern plemochoe is an imita- tion of the hollow sky which revolves like a footless and inverted cup. The concept of a sky cup or bowl is certainly not an unusual one in antiquity. Heraclitus, we are told (Plut. Mor. 890), thought the sky was a bowl which caused an eclipse by turning over. Ennius57 speaks of the sky as a cava cortina because of its resemblance to the lebes of Apollo, imagining the sky, apparently, as an inverted cauldron. Then too, Antigonas of Karystos (Hist. Mirab. 15) speaks about a marvelous bronze (sky?) wagon con- taining an amphora filled with water which was shaken by way of praying to the god for rain when the land suffered from drought. Indeed the wagon and amphora are represented on some of the bronze coins from Krannon.58 From time to time the sky is clearly represented as a vessel. Atlas is represented as holding either a sphere, a hemisphere, or something that looks very much like a large pot spangled with stars.59 On a Mithraic relief from Bononia, the sky is symbolized by an overturned bowl from which water spills like rain.60 The vase painting depicting Aurora pouring dew from an amphora61 is certainly connected with this concept, for dew was thought to fall from the sky.62 One should also mention the reliefs in which the Roman emperor pours from a cup in his right hand, such as the broken relief from Varna Metropolis (Odessa on the Black Sea),63 56 Plut. Epit., 1.6.11=Diels, Doxog. gr., p. 296. 57 Varro, Ling. 7.48=Baehrens, fr. 416. 58 For rain cart, amphora, and coins, see J.

Roscher, Nektar und Ambrosia (Leipzig, 1883), pp. 13-22 and 22-33, has shown that Greeks, Romans, Indians, Germans, and Finns all held that honey falls as dew from the sky. Originally, he believes, ambrosia and nektar were identi- cal, both being honey. 63 E.

Stil. 1.62 f.) tells us that the "King himself tips the cup with his right hand and calls to witness the mysteries of Bel and Mithra who rotates the wandering stars." The earth too, was sometimes thought of as a bowl containing water; elemental water embodied in life or the nourishing, primary, cosmic stuff. Just as the identity of the earth with the Great Mother is deeply rooted in ancient belief throughout the greater part of the world, so is the identity of both with the pot.64 In spite of the fact that all human bodies are experienced as a vessel,65 there are especially good reasons why a pottery vessel should be con- nected with the female, and in particular the earth mother. Pottery is made from clay or the earth itself, as was man in Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hebrew Creation myths.66 The pot as a container is comparable to the mother as a container of the child and the male's experience of the female as a container in sexual inter- course. Earth, too, is a container of seed, and in one aspect the pot appears to be an emblem of fecundity in ancient Greece.67 The earth is also a container of the dead, for earth surrounds them like a vessel wall. Originally the pithos seems to have served for the burial of the dead,68 and Harrison claims that every Greek knew "that the pithos was a grave-jar, that from such grave-jars souls escaped and to them necessarily returned." 69 Although the significance of the earth vessel is usually some- what less clear in representational art than the significance of the sky bowl, it is nonetheless unmistakable on a sizeable number of monuments where both vessels are depicted70 and on a number of 64 G.

A good example of the latter is a circular relief from Salona on which an amphora at the bottom is balanced by the deus aquae vitalis above.71 Perhaps the leaky pithoi in art and myth were essentially wells filled with the "Water of Life" by the Danaides and other water carriers.72 One reason for the more usual representation of the sky cup is fairly clear. When the object of the officiant's intention was closely circumscribed-a burial pot, a grave, a small land holding, or perhaps even a city-a single vessel representing the sky could be used for pouring germinating liquid. On the other hand, when the whole universe was involved, both the earth and the sky must be symbolically represented. COSMIC FOUNDATIONS OF SKY AND EARTH VESSELS The cosmic foundations of these concepts are tolerably clear. Sky and earth vessels are symbolic of and originate from creation cos- mologies which picture the origin of the universe in the bisection or separation of a world egg or globe, or in the hollowing out, through fermentation, of the world substance into twin hemi- spherical or conical world mountains, one growing downward, the other upward. Orphics pictured the universe as created from a world egg73 which was either engendered by a serpent that arose out of water and slime,74 or begotten by a wind.75 The element of water is present in both, for wind and air were thought of as laden with moisture.76 Homer expressed the origin of all things from water mytholo- gically by calling Oceanus, the river which encircles the earth's disk, the origin of all things (II. 14.246), or by saying that the gods owe their origin to Oceanus and that Tethys his wife is their mother (I1. 14.201). Onians77 has pointed out that evidence points 71 See Campbell (n. 16, above), p. 359 and pl. 34, no. 1861. 72 See Harrison, Prolegomena (n. 30, above), pp. 613-23. 73 For an interesting discussion of its symbolic significance see J.

See also Cook, Zeus (n. 48, above), 3:109, who points out that winds were once equated with souls. 77 See Onians (n. 13, above), pp. 249-50. For a parallel concept in the mythology of Hermopolis in Egypt, with primordial ocean as serpent, see H. Kees, "Der 332</page><page sequence="18">History of Religions to a basic Homeric concept of an egglike form girdled by "Oceanus, who is the generation of all." Even Epicurus, according to Epiphanius (Diels, Dox. Graec. 589) said that the beginning of all was like an egg with a tight band of pneuma, like a serpent, around it. Pneuma, like wind and air, is considered both warm and moist.78 Rain too, is not merely water. It is fertilizing moisture vitalized by lightning, a divine fire which brings life to vegetation. It is no wonder then that the sky was considered as one half of the cosmic egg.79 Indeed, Eudemus, a Peripatetic of the fourth century B.C., tells us (Kern, Orph. frag. 28) that an egg was the embryo of the world, and that the two fragments of its broken shell became Earth and Heaven. Nor is it any wonder that the form of a half egg should suggest the form of a pottery vessel like the plemochoe from Thmuis. It is interesting, from this point of view, to compare one version of the late Egyptian concept of the world egg with that of the Greeks. We hear that Ptah himself was formed from the cosmic egg ejected from the mouth of Kneph,80 and that Ptah fashioned, on his potter's wheel, an egg from which the earth was hatched.81 The Hesiodic concept of creation-form is considerably less clear. The initial act is a separation of sky from earth, a separation characteristic of ancient cosmologies.82 In Hesiod, however, the separation is twice repeated. First we are told that the gap (Chaos) came into being between matter of indeterminate com- position fused together (Theog. 116), and later the concept is anthropomorphized with the emasculation and violent separation of Uranus and Gaia (Theog. 176 ff.).83 Although we have no knowl- edge of the composition of the undifferentiated mass or of its physical shape before or after it was divided into sky and earth, it Gotterglaube im alten Aegypten," Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatisch-Agyptischen Gesellschaft 45 (Leipzig, 1941):216.

P.E. 1.9.25 = P 32 a-d (Vigero, 1628). 333</page><page sequence="19">Cosmic Significance of the Plemochoe was almost certainly, as in other Greek concepts and Egyptian and Babylonian myths, at first a watery mass. The very appearance of the sky and its horizon line would probably have suggested the shape of a hemisphere to the ancient Greek. One thing particularly noticeable in the Orphic and Hesiodic cosmologies-the only fairly complete versions of the Greek view of world creation we possess from these early times-is the im- mediate appearance of Eros after the initial separation. In the Orphic cosmology he appears from the egg of which the upper part forms heaven and the lower part earth.84 In the Hesiodic version, he comes into being right after the gap is created (Theog. 120). Guthrie has suggested85 that Eros is the mediating power between heaven and earth "easily rationalized as the rain which falls from heaven and fertilizes the earth or the more general 'moist element' in which philosophers saw the origin of life." In this aspect Eros is equivalant to Pan in the cult of Pan, Men, and the Nymphs dis- cussed above. Perhaps Aphrodite is to be associated, in a similar way, with the second, anthropomorphic separation in Hesiod (Theog. 188 ff.). Perhaps, too, a clue to the physical process envisioned within the eggs of the Orphics, Homer, and Epicurus, as well as within the undifferentiated mass of Hesiod, can be found in Iranian cos- mology. Campbell has pointed out86 that the Iranians conceived world development from the hollowing-out of yeasty dough (KfS) containing the dynamic forces of moisture and heat in fermentation, and he indicates that the word K tS comes from an Indo-European root k'va in which the k was originally accompanied by either an aspirate or sibilant. He lists87 a number of words related to this process of creation derived from k'va variously ex- tended. Among these, the idea of inflation and swelling is represen- ted by Greek kuma, swelling wave, kuros, mighty one, kfeneos, empty, koilos, hollow sky, related to poilos-pzlos, sky cap, Latin cavus, hollow, caelum, sky; and the idea of bubbling, boiling, sucking dry, or crusting over appears in the Greek aphros, foam, related to the Avestan kafa, foam, slime; in the Greek skutos, re- lated to the Latin cutis, skin, scutum, leather shield; and the Greek 84 Aristoph., Birds 696. 85 W.

Confirmation of the existence of such a concept in the Classical world does not rest on linguistic evidence alone. Surely the process does not differ appreciably from that recorded by Ovid (Met. 15.296-306) as responsible for the creation of a hill near Troezen. Athenaeus, as we have seen, tells us that the plemochoe was called by some people a kotyliskos or little kotule. According to Apollodorus (Athen. 2.479a), "the ancients used to call all the hollow space 7TCrv Td KoLAov a kotyle." The linguistic relationship be- tween kotyle and koilos, hollow sky, is readily apparent, and Richter and Milne point out 88 that kotyle is also a generic word for cup in Attic Greek. CONCLUSION The cosmological basis of the Plemochoai rite is widespread in Greek speculative thought. The plemochoai were microcosmic representations of the sky and earth, the two hemispheres brought into existence by a a world creation bisection, which brought into being the opposing tensions and values of the mortal world. The officiant pronounced hue toward the east as he gazed to- ward the sky and poured the water from the plemochoe. Its water symbolized the fertilizing rain whose fertility significance often carried a decision of life or death, or the universal generative psyche. The spark of generative fire which must combine with water to produce life is heavenly and from the fiery east. Day, Sky, and Fire, are Father, and it is the father who also rains (huei).89 The placement of the plemochoe in the east denoted the descent of the world psyche, a combination of heat and moisture, from the divine realm of absolute deity into the world of physical becoming. The officiant then turned to the west, pronounced kue as he gazed toward the earth, and again poured out water from the plemochoe. According to Porphyry,90 the west was assigned to daimones. Life may be divine fire from the east, but it is also physical, mortal, and earthy, from Night and West. Night and Earth are Mother, and the Mother goddesses produce the life- giving aspects of the physical universe. The placement of the plemochoe denotes the birth of new life, for the west was the place 88 G. Richter and M. Milne, Shapes and Names of Athenian Vases (New York, 1935). 89 Cf.

It signifies also the beginning of decay, for birth is inter- mediate between genesis and phthora.91 Death was assigned to the West, as well as birth, because birth is a completion of genesis. Although this paper has dealt only with the cosmological con- cepts involved in the Plemochoai rite, it must be borne in mind that for the late period to which our plemochoe belongs, the concept of a fully sentient psyche and the immortality of the individual soul had made decided inroads in all of the mystery cults and added a new and personal dimension to their significance. I suspect that if Hippolytus refers to the symbolism of the entire Plemochoai rite, and not just to the formula hue, kue, there is undoubtedly truth in what he says. The Plemochoai rite was not in itself the great secret of the Eleusinisn Mysteries, but it probably embodied symbolically the central hopes, fears, and revelations of the Greater Mysteries at Eleusis, which could also be found more or less in other religious rites both public and private. 91 See Campbell (n. 16, above), pp. 345-46, n. 4. 336</page></plain_text>
