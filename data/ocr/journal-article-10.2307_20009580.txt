'Tis that of PRIORITY of time in the cause before the effect. ?Hume's Treatise I TA7ITH some important and indeed recent * * exceptions, the examination of the con? cept of cause and of causal language has largely followed in Hume's footsteps. The regularity theory has been subject to&gt; constant revisions in the light of examinations of puzzling cases as well as ordinary idiom. But these have been by and large questions of detail. Nevertheless one aspect of the broad question of causal relations remains as much in the air today as it was in the 18th Century. This is the problem of causal asymmetry. It is normally, and I believe rightly, supposed that if the singular causal claim "a causes 6" is true then it must be false to say that "b causes a." For example, it seems universally accepted that heating a particular iron bar causes it to glow, but not vice versa. The problem is to de? termine in virtue of what feature or features of the causal relation or its relata this asymmetry obtains. The claim that the causal relation is asym? metrical precludes neither the occurrence of various causal feedback loops nor other sorts of interanimating causal or functional connections. Assertions to the contrary rest on failures to dis? tinguish singular from generic events. In par? ticular, it might be supposed that causal relations are sometimes symmetrical since, for example, a change in the temperature reading of a par? ticular thermostat causes a change in the per? formance of a particular furnace, while a change in the performance of the furnace causes a change in the reading of the thermostat. Notice, however, that though the particular objects in? volved in both causal relations are identical, and the expressions involved do pick out events of the same kind, they do not uniquely pick out particular events. Yet if the compatibility of both of the causal claims in question is to tell against the asymmetry thesis, then they both must refer to the same particular events and not merely the same generic ones. No one would deny that under some generic descriptions of the relata of a causal relation, the relation is sym? metrical. But this is a feature of the descriptive powers of language, and reflects no symmetry among particular events. Although thermostatic changes produce furnace operations and furnace operations produce thermostatic changes it is never the case that the same particular thermo? static change both causes and is the effect of the same bit of furnace operation. And in general every true statement of an apparently sym? metrical causal relation will turn out to be one which does not uniquely refer to particular events and which rests for its truth on the truth of at least two different statements describing asymmetrical causal connections. In what then does this asymmetry consist and how in general are we to distinguish cause from effect? Hume distinguished the cause from the effect in particular causal relations by reference to temporal asymmetry: the cause is always tem? porally prior to the effect. Indeed Hume ad? vanced an argument to show that if this were not so, then "there would be no such thing as suc? cession, and all objects [events] must be co? existent" (p. 76).1 In fact, Hume advances a reductio of the very possibility that a cause can produce its effect simultaneously with its own occurrence: Assume that for any two simul? taneous events, c and e, c can cause e. Now "it is an established maxim both in natural and moral philosophy," that if any event produces another later than it might, then there must be 245 l Treatise of Human Nature, ed. by L. A. Selby-Bigge (Oxford, 1965). All further page references in this text for Hume's claims are to this edition.</page><page sequence="2">246 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY some further necessary factor which conjoined with the first event, constitutes the real, full cause of the second. According to Hume, it fol? lows from this maxim and our supposition that a full cause always produces its effects simul? taneously with itself. But "the consequence of this would be no less than the destruction of that succession of causes which we observe in the world; and indeed the utter annihilation of time." Hume did not set great store by this argument, and we can perhaps see why. The force of the argument can be turned on the "established maxim" as easily as on the possi? bility he tries to rule out; and the argument seems to rest on an account of time order which renders viciously circular the claim that tem? poral priority is a necessary condition of causa? tion. Moreover, Kant2 and many subsequent philosophers have produced so many alleged counter-examples to the temporal priority cri? terion that it seems no longer seriously enter? tained as a necessary condition for the existence of a singular causal relation. What conditions would an acceptable alterna? tive to the temporal asymmetry condition have to meet? I suggest that an adequate condition would at least have to complete the traditional regularity condition in a non-circular way without making essential reference to Hume's own condition, temporal asymmetry. That is, it should be a condition such that its fulfillment, together with fulfillment of some variety of the constant conjunction condition and of the spatio temporal contiguity condition, would be jointly sufficient for the truth of a singular causal judg? ment; and like the constant conjunction, or spatio-temporal contiguity conditions it should be free from "contamination" by the analysan dum. Failing this adequacy condition, a pro posed analysis could not very well be substituted for the temporal priority condition in the original analysis without incurring Hume's own objections to rival accounts of causality.3 I call this adequacy condition "the non-circular, non temporal, completing condition," or the "NCT condition" for short. An alternative to this criterion would be an entirely novel non-Humean account of causality which settled the problem at hand inter alia, while avoiding the Humean objections which other accounts have fallen afoul of. This seems a tall order indeed, and a project not worth attempting unless very serious difficulties are met with in attempts to satisfy the NCT cri? terion I have advanced. One other, even less appealing alternative is to give up the whole enterprise and conclude, with Michael Scriven, "that cause is a logically irreducible concept but one which may be usefully analyzed in terms of other causally contaminated notions."* I shall argue that if we cannot satisfy the NCT criterion the best course is to return to Hume's own sug? gestion, temporal priority, and to try to work the force out of the alleged counter-examples. In what follows I shall examine a number of the latest accounts of causal asymmetry in order to determine whether they satisfy the NCT cri? terion. The accounts I canvass are due to Gasking and von Wright, Aronson, and Mackie.5 I shall then be in a position to propose recon? sideration of an asymmetrical condition in the spirit of Hume's original claim. II Gasking and von Wright both advance a manipulability theory of causation, whose princi? pal motivation is the inability of the Humean 2 In the Critique of Pure Reason, tr. by N. Kemp Smith (New York, 1965), p. 227?, Kant cites the operating of a stove and the room's being hot as an example of a cause simultaneous with its effect. Even more famous is the passage in which he describes a ball as the cause of the hollow it produces in a pillow by resting on it. Careful reading of Kant shows that, unlike subsequent philosophers, he did not suppose these cases to be incompatible with the tem? poral asymmetry condition for causal priority. 3 Some philosophers might claim that the temporal priority criterion itself fails to satisfy this adequacy condition, since temporal succession must itself be explained by reference to causal relations. In response it must be pointed out that the notions of cause at work in these philosophers' accounts are often of an explicitly non-Humean character: moreover their accounts are of a programmatic and sometimes speculative character, enjoying no widespread sup? port, and making a far less pressing claim to widespread and systematic interest than the problem currently at hand. But see Bas van Frassen, Introduction to the Philosophy of Time and Space (New York, 1970), especially Chapter 1, pp. 30-57, and Chapter 6. * Michael Scriven, "The Logic of Cause," Theory and Decision, vol. 2 (1967), p. 49. 5 Douglas Gasking, "Causation and Recipes," Mind, vol. 64 (1955), pp. 479-487.

I shall concentrate on Gasking's account since it has had wider circulation and is neither so contro? versial nor so sketchy as von Wright's argument. On this view causes can be distinguished from effects in all cases by reference to the notion of a manipulative technique. Consider the statement "This iron bar's now being at a heat of isoo?C is the cause of its currently glowing." The heat? ing here is the cause, according to Gasking even though it is simultaneous with the glowing be? cause "we have a general manipulative technique for making anything hot... and we have no general manipulative technique for making things glow (p. 483)." In a world otherwise arranged, a world in which we had manipula? tive techniques for producing glowing and none for heating, we should have to say that the glow? ing was the cause of the heating. Moreover, in cases of causal relations where manipulation is beyond our powers, there is always a manipula? tive technique for events of the same sort as the cause. For example, we know that the melting of a polar ice cap is the cause of a rise in the mean sea level and not vice versa because we can produce a similar effect in a bucket by melting ice into it. Thus the manipulative technique account may avoid the charge of anthropo centrism, a charge to which von Wright un? necessarily pleads guilty. Unfortunately the account leaves unexplained the notion of manipulative technique, and any analysis of this notion presupposes either the notion of cause or one of its cognates, like "produce," "bring about," "make." Under what conditions does a particular series of events? actions, bodily movements?constitute a manipu? lative technique for bringing about some other event or state? Only if the connection between the former events?actions or bodily movements ?and the state of affairs which follows them is determined to be non-accidental and asymmetri? cal, i.e., causal. But this determination requires prior agreement on the meaning of cause, and consequently fails the NCT condition. Further? more, given two events of a sort constantly con? joined and spatio-temporally contiguous whether simultaneous or not, how can we determine for which one we have a manipulative technique? That is, what justifies us in asserting that we have a manipulative technique for heating and not for glowing? Having ruled out temporal asym? metry, we can hardly appeal to the fact that heating precedes the glowing to warrant the claim that the former has a manipulative tech? nique and is consequently the cause. To do so is tantamount to&gt; re-establishing the temporal priority criterion which this account is supposed to supercede. Finally, returning to cases beyond our powers of manipulation, if the manipulability criterion is to be applicable either to microphysics or physical cosmology we must be able to sort out all events into classes such that in each class some events are subject to manipulative tech? niques and are sufficiently similar to other mem? bers of the class not so subject that we can determine analogically which among two causal connected microphysical or cosmological events is the cause. But in virtue of what constitutive properties of events could we determine their respective classes? These properties cannot be straight-forwardly observable ones, for neither microphysical nor cosmological events have such properties. As I have argued elsewhere,6 in every case what the relevant properties are will hinge either on what causal laws we accept or on what causal relations the events in question enter into. Here again the manipulability theory violates our NCT adequacy criterion. Ill The manipulability theory has its ancestors in the views of some of Hume's contemporaries: indeed some trace its lineage back to the Aristotelian doctrine that cause is conceptually dependent on action. According to an equally antique account causation rests on the trans? ference of a quantity of something from the cause to- the effect. A modern variant of this doc? trine purports to solve the asymmetry problem by suggesting that prior to the occurrence of the effect, the object involved in the cause possesses a quantity of something which is transferred on contact to the object involved in the e?ect. This view has been lately advanced by Aronson who provides it as an alternative to the manipula? bility account, which he charges with anthropo? morphism. His more specific purpose is to "justify the use of 'cause' in the theoretical ? "Causation and Recipes: The Mixture as Before?", Philosophical Studies, vol. 19 (1973), pp. 378-385.</page><page sequence="4">248 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY sciences by supplying ... non-anthropomorphic conditions for determining the direction of the cause-effect relation (p. 414)." Aronson adduces three conditions for "a causes b" of which the third is relevant to the present discussion. (3) Prior to the time of the occurrence of [the effect], the body that makes contact with the effect object possesses a quantity (e.g. velocity, momentum, kinetic energy, etc.) which is trans? ferred to the effect object (when contact is made) and manifested as [the effect]. Thus to determine which of two causally con? nected events is the cause we need only determine the direction of the transfer of some quantity (P-4**) This suggestion is disarmingly simple, but will it help us isolate causes from effects, in the hard cases where temporal asymmetry is missing, or even in the easy cases where it is present? Is it even true or illuminating to claim that every causal connection involves a transference? The first difficulty is with the notion of trans? ferring some quantity from the object mentioned in a description of the cause to an object men? tioned in the description of the effect. Does the determination of the direction of the transfer involve determining which object had the quantity first and which second? Yes seems an obvious answer. However, if so, then Aronson's account is unapplicable to the hard cases of simultaneous causation which led us to suspect Hume's account. This is plain since it rests in a fairly direct way to the temporal priority account of asymmetry which it was intended to supplant; it is equally clear that so understood it violates the NCT criterion. Suppose, however, per impossibile, that quantities can be transferred instantaneously and continuously so that in a case of simul? taneous causation a quantity is transferred con? tinually during the whole temporal interval occupied by cause and effect. For example, sup? pose that the turning of a particular gear, call it a, during some interval causes the turning of gear b during that same interval (neither is connected to a motor during the interval). In this case we might want to say that the motion of gear a was the cause since it transferred kinetic energy to gear b. Naturally it could only do so during the whole interval if both gears were perfectly rigid and perfectly enmeshed so that the kinetic energy could be instantaneously transferred from, say, the axle of a to the body of b. The fact that this is physically impossible is no objection since we may not want our account of causation limited to physical possibilities. However in order to unobjectionably denominate a's motion the cause we must be able to determine that a is trans? ferring kinetic energy to b without presuming that ?'s motion is the cause of 6's motion. But this we cannot do. Consider the two sentences: (i) At t rigid gear a perfectly enmeshed with rigid gear b is in motion. (ii) At t rigid gear a is transferring kinetic energy to rigid gear b with which it is perfectly enmeshed. (i) describes the event which we wish to denomi? nate the cause: (ii), as it happens, describes the very same event: kinetic energy is a measure of the product of mass and velocity; if it is being transferred, it must be non-zero, and conse? quently the (angular) velocity of a must be non? zero as well, i.e., a must be in (rotary) motion. The inference from motion back to transferring kinetic energy is equally transparent, (i) and (ii) entail one another. If they describe events uniquely they must describe the same event. If, ex hypothesi (i) describes the cause of gear b's motion, then so does (ii). On the other hand (ii) is supposed to describe the condition in virtue of which one of two simultaneous causally con? nected events is the cause of the other. It turns out to do so only in the trivial sense that it re describes the cause. The occurrence of the trans? fer is tantamount to the occurrence of the cause, indeed both events are numerically identical. Accordingly, it is no easier to detect a transfer and its direction than it is to determine which of two simultaneous causally connected events is the cause and which is the effect. Announcing that there is a transfer comes down simply to announcing that there is a causal relationship. Learning which of the two objects transferred a quantity to the other seems to require that we already know which is the cause, thus violating the NCT condition. A heroic alternative is to suggest that if (ii) describes the event we wish to denominate cause, then there must be some other quantity trans? ferred from a to b. Unfortunately physical al? ternatives like inertia, force, etc., engender the same difficulties kinetic energy does. The re</page><page sequence="5">PROPTER HOC, ERGO POST HOC 249 course to secret powers of the cause was justly criticized in the Treatise (p. 161, p. 633, and elsewhere) and need not detain us. The sug? gestion that we determine the direction of transference cannot help us in the cases of simultaneous causation. The difficulty with this account becomes even clearer in a case where causes and effect are temporally asymmetrical. Suppose our two perfectly rigid gears are separated, a is rotating and b is stationary. Now if a is moved towards b until they mesh, then at the time of meshing the angular velocity of a is instantaneously decreased, while fc's velocity is increased. Here we have two temporally asym? metrical causal relations: (1) gear a's motion before meshing caused gear &amp;'s motion after meshing, and (2) gear fe's lack of motion before meshing with a caused a reduction in gear a's angular velocity after meshing. If, as in the previous case, we insist that the direction of transference is from gear a to gear b, then we are precluded from saying that gear b's condition of motionlessness before meshing caused the subse? quent reduction in the velocity of gear a. Unless, that is, we insist that gear b did transfer some? thing to gear a. But the only candidate for this seems to be something like "negative" kinetic energy. If we are to allow this transference, then we must allow it in the simultaneous case as well, for the mechanics of the situation is the same. There, too, gear b transfers some quantity to gear a, and satisfies the transference condition for being the cause of gear a's motion. The only way to avoid this difficulty is by prior exhaustive and exclusive partition of transferable quantities into two classes. The first composed of those whose direction of transference determines the direction of causation; the second composed of those of which this is not true. But the assign? ment of quantities to either list plainly hangs on a prior determination of causal directionality, and consequently violates the NCT adequacy condition. The entire transference doctrine rests on a mistaken view of the relation between causal assertions and the attribution of transferable qualities. The attribution of such quantities is undertaken in the provision of a theory to systematize and quantify the interrelations be? tween propositions which are antecedently de? termined to describe causal relations. We do not attribute properties in virtue of which one event can cause another before having determined that the first event does cause the other. Having once decided what causal relations there are among phenomena, we begin to hypothesize about the properties which will explain these relations. The citation of transferable quantities enables us to bring apparently diverse causal relationships into the same class, and sometimes provides a unified quantitative explanation of these rela? tions, as well as predictions about future causal connections and as yet undiscovered ones. But they can hardly be cited in order to determine the direction of causality when this very direc? tionality is in question. IV Among the most influential of current writers on causality, J. L. Mackie has devoted consider? able attention to the problem of causal asym? metry, or as he prefers to call it, "causal priority." Mackie argues convincingly that the otherwise useful notion of inus condition which he intro? duced in "Causes and Conditions" (in American Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 2 [1965], pp. 245 264) cannot provide the asymmetry which we seek: To say that A was ... an inus condition of B is not to say that B was an inus condition for A. This asymmetry, however, cannot constitute causal priority... For if A is an inus condition of B, then, provided that there is some necessary and sufficient condition for A itself, B will also be an inus condition of A. Since [for instance] the short circuit was, given the circumstances, nonredundant and was sufficient for the fire, the fire, together with these circumstances, formed a sufficient con? dition for the short circuit, and of this sufficient condition the fire was a nonredundant part... Thus although the relation 'is an inus condition of is not symmetrical, an effect usually is in fact an inus condition of its cause (p. 446). In effect we may conclude an event is always an inus condition of its cause. Mackie offers the following characterization of causal asymmetry (or as he calls it "causal priority," p. 457): (I) If events x and y are causally connected in a direct line then x is causally prior to y if there is a time at which x is fixed while y is not fixed otherwise than by its causal connection with x. One central notion here is "fixity," which is characterized thus (p. 459):</page><page sequence="6">250 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY (II) An event z is fixed at time t, IFF, either z has occurred at or before t or a suf? ficient cause of z has occurred at or be? fore t. If (II) is substituted into (I) the result is something like the following: (III) If (x and y are causally connected in a direct line) then {if [(at t, (x or its suf? ficient cause has occurred) and (neither y nor a sufficient cause of y, other than x has occurred)] then [x is causally prior to y]} I have rearranged a clause and added brackets to facilitate comprehension. The immediate diffi? culty with (III) is its blatant violation of the NCT condition: The word "cause" appears or is presupposed at several places in the analysans, which in any case provide at most a sufficient condition for causal priority. Perhaps (III) can be revised to avoid this difficulty. Suppose we substitute for "sufficient cause" the expression "condition (causally) sufficient in the circum? stances" or "sufficient condition" for short; notice "sufficient condition" is non-symmetrical and can be explained in terms of constant con? junction alone. If a is sufficient for b, then b can be sufficient for a as well. For "a is causally con? nected to 2?" we can substitute "a and b are spatio-temporally contiguous and of event-types which are constantly conjoined," or for short "a is constantly and contiguously conjoined with 6" (of course this and the previous abbreviation make sense only as abbreviations. Only generic events can be said to be constantly conjoined). This relation is plainly symmetrical. Thus we can produce a version of (III) which does not transparently violate the NCT condition: (IV) If (x and y are constantly and con? tiguously conjoined) then {if [at t, (x or its sufficient condition has occurred) and (neither y nor a sufficient condition of y other than x has occurred)] then [x is causally prior to y]}. The questions remain, Does (IV) convey the sense of (III)? Does it provide even a sufficient con? dition for causal priority? Naturally if the answer to the latter question proves to be in the negative it is open to argue that (IV) does not convey the sense of (III). To such a claim I can only reply that there seems no other plausible way to render (III) as (part of) a non-circular, non-temporal, completing condition of cause. Thesis (IV) requires one further clarification. Exactly what sense are we to make of the clause "neither y nor a sufficient condition of y other than x has occurred." I suggest we take this phrase to mean: Either (y or its sufficient condition have not occurred) or (x's occurrence or its sufficient condition's occurrence is the sufficient condition of the occurrence of y or its sufficient condition). Although perhaps unduly complicated and in? elegant, this reformulation has the virtue of being explicit. Assuming that (IV) represents a reasonable re? vision of Mackie's proposal which does not vio? late the NCT condition, can it handle the hard cases; can it distinguish the cause from the effect in a case of simultaneous causation? We nor? mally want to say that an iron bar's being at a certain temperature is the cause of the simul? taneous but distinct event of the bar's glowing with a characteristic color. Call the former event x and the latter y. Clearly x and y are constantly and contiguously conjoined, and x has occurred. Has y not occurred otherwise than through its constant and contiguous conjunction with x? That is, does x's occurrence provide the sufficient condition of y's occurrence? According to our definition of sufficient condition as "causally suf? ficient in the circumstances" and the laws of physics, x's occurrence does provide the sufficient condition for y. Thus (IV) empowers us to say that x is causally prior to y; the heating is the cause, the glowing the effect in this case. But will (IV) rule out y's being the cause and x's being the effect? The answer to this question hangs on whether or not y's occurrence provides a sufficient condition for x's occurrence. Is it true or false that the bar's heating at t is not fixed otherwise than by its causal connection to the bar's glowing? Well, we want to say that it is false. But we cannot. In this paradigm case of simultaneous causation the glowing is a sufficient condition for the heating, the heating could not have occurred otherwise than through its causal connection with the glowing; the glowing does provide a sufficient condition of the bar's heating, just in virtue of the same physical laws which underwrite the sufficiency of heating for glowing. It may be suggested that the defect here lies with our definition of sufficient condition as "condition merely sufficient in the circum? stances." Naturally, glowing is sufficient in this sense for heating. It is an inus condition of heat? ing, and this is all we mean by sufficient in the</page><page sequence="7">PROPTER HOC, ERGO POST HOC Sol circumstances. But the heating here is not merely sufficient in the circumstances, it is sufficient simpliciter, whereas, the glowing clearly is not. If this line of argument were sound, it would be a conclusive reply to my revision of (IV). How? ever the heating of the bar, on Mackie's own account, is not a sufficient condition of its glowing, simpliciter. Moreover, if (IV) were strengthened so that the "sufficient cause" of Mackie's original condition, (III), is taken to mean "sufficient causal condition simpliciter9' then no events we could describe would satisfy either (III) or (IV), and Mackie's account would be utterly inapplicable to the problem of causal asymmetry.7 Consider the general case of two causally con? nected events. Nothing could possibly count as the fixing of one event which could not count as the fixing of the other, unless we import tem? poral asymmetry as evidence. There is no ob? servable evidence that we could appeal to as "fixing" an event which could not count equally as fixing its constant concomitant no matter how much later this concomitant occurs, unless we make its later occurrence evidence of its non fixity. But this is simply to import the temporal asymmetry condition in the relatively direct way that we excluded at the outset. To take a clear case, suppose we say that Jones' drunkenness at t\ caused his auto accident at t2. How can we refute the patently absurd claim that his auto accident at t2 caused the drunkenness at tx} Cer? tainly not by pointing out that the intake of some particular amount of alcohol at t0 fixed at t0 the drunkenness at tu but did not fix at t0 the auto accident at t2. This might be claimed on the grounds that it was sufficient for the drunkenness and not for the auto accident. But as I argued earlier either "sufficient" here means "sufficient in the (actual) circumstances" in which case the amount of alcohol intaken was sufficient for both the drunkenness and the accident so that both were fixed at t0; or "sufficient" means something stronger in which case the intake of alcohol at ?0 was sufficient for neither the event at tx nor the event at t2: it fixed neither of them. Since, ex hypothesi, it fixed the drunkenness, it must also have fixed the accident. Accordingly, since the drunkenness was not fixed otherwise than by its causal connection to the alcohol intake, i.e., the sufficient condition and thereby the fixer of the auto accident, it must follow, on the strength of (IV), that the auto accident was causally prior to the drunkenness. But this is of course absurd. The absurdity cannot be refuted by arguing that the intake of alcohol fixed the drunkenness at t0 but did not fix the accident since it was not sufficient for it. For one thing, if there are reasons to say that the alcohol intake did not fix the accident before tlf because, it was not suf? ficient for the accident, then it must be allowed that it did not fix the drunkenness (at t{) at any time before tu since it was not sufficient for the drunkenness before then either. But if the drunkenness was fixed only at tit and ex hypothesi the drunkenness fixed at tx the auto accident at t2, then both were fixed simul? taneously. The only way to block this inference is to deny that the drunkenness was sufficient for the accident, i.e., to deny that at tt it fixed the accident at t2. But this is tantamount to denying that it caused the accident, and is too high a price to pay for the denial that the acci? dent caused the drunkenness. But besides these difficulties this set of replies makes such trans? parent use of the temporal asymmetry between events, that it transparently violates the adequacy conditions set forth initially. Short of violating this condition, there is no way to show that if the drunkenness was causally prior to the accident, the accident was not equally prior in the same sense to the drunkenness. But if the suggested criterion of causal asymmetry fails as decisively by way of tests with clear cases as it does with the hard cases, there remains little to recommend it. (In fairness to Mackie it must be said that in advancing his account he imposed upon himself neither of the adequacy criteria I have set forth, and, supplemented by temporal considerations, it may still have a place in discussions of causal asymmetry. On the other hand the failure of a treatment of asymmetry to complete in a non 7 The question whether any event is causally sufficient for some other is complicated by questions surrounding the distinction between events and the terms we hit upon to describe them. I have argued elsewhere that though we can? not completely describe an event which is causally sufficient, the events we do (partially) describe are causally sufficient for their effects. However, it will also turn out that their effects, though also only partially described, are sometimes sufficient simpliciter for these causes. So that we cannot base general claims of asymmetry on occasional asymmetries of causal conditionality. See my papers, "Mill and Some Contemporary Critics on Cause," The Personalist, vol. 59 (1973), pp. 1 23-130, and "On Kim's Account of Events and Event-Identity," The Journal of Philosophy, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="8">252 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY circular way an analysis of cause in the spirit of Hume evacuates such a treatment of much of its interest.)8 V The accounts I have canvassed have decisively failed the adequacy criterion I have advanced. This naturally suggests a relaxation of the NCT criterion. But to relax it involves nothing less than seriously reconsidering Hume's original argument and suggestion as well as possible modifications of it. My advocacy of such a relaxation should be no surprise, for if time order is ruled out then, in general, there is no conceivable empirically available evidence to decide which of two causally connected events is the cause. That is, there can be no such relevant evidence so long as we embrace a regularity theory like Hume's, which rests singular causal connections on the existence of general ones. It is easy to show that constant conjunction cannot provide any such general conditions of asymmetry. Suppose con? stant conjunction is simply a relation of inus conditionality between spatio-temporally con? tiguous events of two sorts. Since this relation is symmetrical and since spatio-temporal contiguity is symmetrical, then short of temporal position there is no property relevant to denominate some sort of event a cause in Hume's sense which is not also a property of some other event con? stantly conjoined and spatio-temporally con? tiguous with it. Suppose on the other hand that constant conjunction is not generally symmetri? cal. Plainly we cannot suppose that it is always asymmetrical since this is patently false: Many events are invariably followed (in the circum? stances) by other events which themselves (in the circumstances) only follow events of the former kind. This leaves only nonsymmetry as generally true of the relation of constant conjunction. But to say that constant conjunction is nonsymmetri cal is tantamount to admitting that it is in general no guide to the direction of causation. For if some sorts of effects are constantly con? joined with only one sort of causes, and other sorts are not, then there is no general asymmetry to be found in this constant conjunction con? dition which is applicable to all cases of causal connection. Moreover this difference between constant conjunctions that are symmetrical and those that are not is, arguably, an artifact of language, and not an integral feature of causal relations. So long as we retain a Humean account of causation we must embrace the temporal asym? metry condition, or consign our belief that causa? tion is asymmetrical to the limbo of empirically and conceptually unwarranted dogmas. It may be suggested that my conclusion is absurd, if only because its consequences involve the suggestion that apparent cases of simul? taneous causation are either not really simul? taneous or alternatively they are not really cases of causal connection at all. I grant that my con? clusion does involve choosing at least one of these consequences. They are however very far from distressing, although one is slightly preferable to the other, as I shall show. If we accept the first suggestion, that there are no cases of causes and effects that are simul? taneous, we must suppose that there are many more causal forks in nature than our prejudices had hitherto led us to suppose: an iron bar's heating and its glowing will turn out to both be effects of some third event. The turning of two enmeshed gears will never be related as cause and effect, but will both be effects of some third event. This fact, if it is a fact, is surprising, but it is not a conceptually intolerable surprise, it is an empirical surprise. It is no more inconceivable and no more surprising than the discovery that the behavior of rigid rods and clocks depends on their velocity. Surprises are often unpleasant, but it is preferable to retain the Humean analysis at the cost of an empirically surprising but logically coherent result, than to reject the most success? ful account of causation currently available, not on conceptual, but on empirical grounds. Still, even more preferable would be an alter? native which was neither empirically surprising nor conceptually intolerable. The second sug? gestion provides such an alternative. Instead of denying that either of two apparently simul? taneous causally connected events was the cause, 8 It should also be noted that in Chapter Seven of his latest work, The Cement of the Universe?A Study of Causation (Oxford, 1974), Mackie gives an account of causal asymmetry altogether different from the one examined here. The account there offered is, however, embedded in an impressively worked out non-Humean account of causa? tion. Thus it is more difficult to assess than accounts offered by way of supplementing or completing the regularity theory, involving, as it does, issues of much wider scope. In this work Mackie specifically directs his attention to some of the issues I have dealt with here. Cf. especially his discussion of the problem of sufficient cause.</page><page sequence="9">PROPTER HOC, ERGO POST HOC 253 we can insist that they are not in fact simul? taneous, and the event which began first is the cause. On this view, we are committed to the assertion that the heating of the iron bar did precede the glowing, that the motion of one gear did precede the other, even when the instru? ments at hand can detect no such lag. Is it an objection to this claim that it adds a condition to the analysis of "cause" whose satisfaction in some cases can never be conclusively established? Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, such an assertion adds no&gt; burden of openness or unverifiability to the Humean concept of cause. For this burden is already there. Since on the regularity theory, the assertion of any singular causal relation rests on the truth of an assertion of universal constant conjunction, for which the evidence is always formally incomplete, the former assertion is already strictly unverifiable. If we insist that the assertion of a singular causal relation (sometimes) commits us to an unverifi? able temporal asymmetry, then this is a "draw? back" with which the Humean concept of cause is already encumbered. Moreover, it is an essential "drawback," for the universally recog? nized contingency of causal relations requires them to be strictly unverifiable. We know that some of our assertions of causal connection turn out to be spurious, and we need to make room in our concept of cause for just this sort of possi? bility in a number of different ways. After all, how are we to distinguish causal forks from genuine cause and effect relations, when both are cases of types of events spatio-temporally con? tiguous and constantly conjoined? Moreover the claim that there is no temporal gap between any two particular events is always an empirical one and, like any negative existential proposition, it is never conclusively verifiable. In consequence, the assertion that in any particular case a cause and its effect are simultaneous is open to pre? cisely the same "drawback" that the regularity theory cum temporal priority faces. The change of unverifiability can be no objection against the assertion that there are no simultaneous causal relations. Can it be alleged that insisting on the tem? poral asymmetry of cause and effect in the face of apparent counterexamples is legislating em? pirical facts out of existence? Putting the prob? lem this way sounds question begging, for the very question at issue is whether the alleged counterexamples do express empirical facts. But in any case do we not already have empirical evidence to show that, for example, there is a lag between the onset of the motion of one gear and the onset of the motion of the second? After all we know that no gear is perfectly rigid, and no two gears can be perfectly enmeshed. Are these not good empirical reasons to expect a lag in this case? Similarly, on the atomic level we know there are lags between the absorption of energy by an electron and its radiation which provide for a lag between the heating and the glowing of an iron bar. It is not by any means clear that our scientific theories commit us to the occurrence of any simultaneous events which are related as cause and effect, so the suggestion that insisting on temporal asymmetry is tantamount to a blind rejection of the empirical facts is, if not question begging, at least wanting in evidence. What scientific theories, and common sense for that matter, do commit us to is the occur? rence of perfectly contemporaneous states of which one is the cause and the other the effect. That is, given any two overlapping events of finitely short duration we can find or arbitrarily designate contemporaneous segments of them and insist, quite properly, that one is the cause and the other the effect. I suspect that it is this thought which lurks behind the objection I can? vassed in the previous paragraph. And indeed, this difficulty has merit. It does call for modifica? tion or at least qualification on the temporal asymmetry condition. It is not hard to sketch out what such a qualification would look like. We shall have to say that if x causes y then x is temporally prior to y, or x and y are contem? poraneous, and x and y are segments of two events s and t, such that s is temporally prior to t. The problem is to provide conditions for recognizing which events simultaneous causally connected states are segments of. But the answer to this problem, like so many others, rests on a prior identification of causal laws. If we know what sorts of events are temporally overlapping but non-contemporaneous, though constantly conjoined and spatially contiguous, then we can determine whether two simultaneous states are causally connected and which of them is the cause. In consequence if someone still wants to insist the iron bar's heating and its glowing are contemporaneous, and the motion of gear a is simultaneous to the motion of gear b, though in each case the former event is the cause, we can allow it, provided they will admit that in both</page><page sequence="10">254 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY cases we are dealing with states, segments of events which are temporally overlapping but not contemporaneous. This may seem reasonable in cases where the states are segments of on-going processes. What of the interrelation of states which are, so to speak, in equilibrium? For in? stance, consider a cannonball lying on a pillow during a time interval. Here, it may be urged we should say that the position of the cannonball during the interval is caused by the position of the pillow, yet there is no temporal interval and no events which could be reasonably cited for these states to be segments of. We have a number of alternatives by way of reply. We can argue that although there are causal relations here there is no causal asymmetry in this case at all, so that no temporal interval is required. There is no asymmetry, for the position of the ball is also a cause of the position of the pillow since it causes a deformity in the surface due to its weight. This course is not open to us, unless the claim made at the outset that all causal relation? ships involve asymmetry is withdrawn. Such an admission would require that the thesis I am defending be qualified; viz., temporal asymmetry is the criterion of causal asymmetry, but not a necessary condition of causality in general. Thus qualified the thesis is not devoid of interest, but is much reduced in force. Moreover I believe it is unnecessary, as I shall argue shortly. Another alternative is to deny that such equilibrium situations involve causality at all. (Nagel argues this way with respect to the ideal gas laws in Structure of Science (New York, 1961), p. 77.) But the only ground for this seems to be the absence of temporal asymmetry in these cases. And this gives the tactic a question-begging flavor. The most reasonable view here is to notice that the appearance of symmetry is actually due to the fact that these situations involve two distinct asymmetrical causal connections moving in dif? ferent directions, both of which involve states which seem clearly to be segments of non-con? temporaneous events. In the present case, one asymmetry involves the weight of the ball and the consequent deformation of the pillow where the ball's having weight is clearly temporally prior to the event of the pillow's deforming. The other asymmetry involves the pillow's rigidity and position which is temporally prior to the change of velocity of the ball on contact with the pillow, where this change is not instantaneously transmitted from the bottom of the sphere to the top. So understood we have two causal asym? metries, both with matching non-simultaneous events of which the states involved are but segments. Thus, the second of the two alternatives which the re-imposition of a temporal asymmetry con? dition forces us to choose between is neither empirically surprising nor conceptually intoler? able. In consequence, the view that none of the causes we have thus far isolated is simultaneous with its effect is preferable to the supposition that we were mistaken in some of the events we have hitherto identified as causes when each was really but a tine in some causal fork. Although one view is preferable, both views are at least logically tenable. VI Immediately after the passage quoted at the beginning of this paper, Hume writes: Some pretend that 'tis not absolutely necessary a cause should precede its effect; but that any object or action, in the very first moment of its existence, may exert its productive quality, and give rise to another object or action, perfectly co-temporary with itself. But besides that experience in most instances seems to contradict this opinion we may establish the relation of priority by a kind of inference or reasoning (p. 76). The "reasoning" which follows this claim is one of those few passages of the Treatise which seem utterly unconvincing. In the present paper I have tried to provide Hume with a substitute argu? ment that will underwrite his own claims. I have done so by considering whether any of a number of plausible alternatives to his own criterion of causal asymmetry can be added to the regularity theory without rendering that theory circular. The results of this consideration turn out to be negative, and lead to a defense of the criterion Hume originally proposed.9 Dalhousie University Received May 14, 1974 91 must express my gratitude to T. L. Beauchamp, W. Ruddick, D. Sanford, for helpful discussion of the issues surrounding causal asymmetry, as well as to Canada Council and Dalhousie University for providing the opportunity for us to examine these matters. I owe thanks to Robert M. Martin, D. Braybrooke, R. M. Campbell and J. L. Mackie for commenting on earlier drafts. I am especially indebted to the last for my understanding of Hume's original argu? ment. Errors, there and elsewhere, are entirely my own responsibility.</page></plain_text>
