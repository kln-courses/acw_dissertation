Without the teamwork, partnership and cooperation of dedicated individuals and organizations, no conference of this size and complexity could take place. The Society is holding its 85th Annual meeting this August; for a venerable organization such as ours, the first of the new millennium. In these exciting times, ESA is forging new ground and engaging additional constituencies and communities in a dialogue concerning important ecological research and policy issues . Due to the vision of the Governing Board, the energy of Headquarters and Ithaca staff and the efforts of volunteer lead ership, ESA has reached out to a wider diversity of ecological scientists and students and has incorporated new initiatives and programs for the pub lic and the media.

Snowbird is ringed by soaring mountain peaks and meadows dotted in summer with colorful wild flowers. About a mile from Snowbird, at the head wall of Little Cottonwood Canyon, is the Alta Ski Resort. At an elevation of 8,000 feet with a series of scattered buildings, condo minium units and lodges, Snowbird, the setting for this year's Annual Meeting, is dramatic, rustic and relatively remote. The drive into the canyon will take you up a winding mountain road flanked by mountain streams and running through National Forest Service lands. This Program includes a compendium describing the natural fea tures in this area and hiking and exculsions in the locality sur rounding Snowbird. In order to take advantage of Snowbird's isolated location while still enabling ESA to schedule the full range of scientific and edu cational programs in the most efficient time frame possible, this year's Annual Meeting has been organized in a unique way. In addition to business meetings, mixers and social events, evenings at this year's Annual Meeting will feature Scientific Evening Sessions. From 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. each evening, a Poster Pub will give those who want to review the posters without competition from other scheduled science sessions a chance to buy a beer and tour the posters at their leisure. The actual start ing and ending times for oral and symposium presentations will be staggered to reduce the peak pressure on the food outlets and restaurants located in Snowbird Village.

SECTIONS/COMMITTEES/CHAPTERS Most ESA Sections and Chapters hold business meetings and mixers during the annual meeting. These regularly occur as brown bags during lunch hour or in the late afternoon or early evening at the end of the scientific sessions-costs are generally covered by Section and Chapter dues and a cash bar. Most Sections and Chapters welcome newcomers interested in attending the meet ing/mixer to learn more about the activities undertaken by the Section or Chapter. Most Committees hold their meetings in the early morning and occasionally during the lunch hour. Again, most of these meetings are open to those interested in the work of the committee. The preliminary schedule of times and locations for all these meetings is printed in this Preliminary Program. Please refer to the Official Program and the Meeting At A Glance for the final schedule. WEATHER, ATTIRE AND WELL-BEING Snowbird is located at an elevation of 8,000 feet. Attendees should note that people sometimes feel light-headed at this alti tude. Care should be taken during the first few days in Snowbird not to over-exert and to become adjusted to the altitude. The summer weather in the Utah mountains is very pleasant warm during the days, cool in the evenings. Because of the high elevation, the intensity of the sun can burn you quickly, so you should make certain to bring sun screen and a cap or hat. As with most conference centers with air conditioning, you should make certain to bring a sweatshirt, a light jacket or a sweater, and socks so you can be comfortable moving between the outdoors and the meeting rooms. Snowbird Village is located a distance from stores and pharma cies. Although there are small shops at Snowbird, you will find the prices of some basic items rather high. We advise that you pur chase basic medications and health-care products before you arrive and bring them with you. INTERNET CAFE2 During the LTER All Scientists Meeting and the ESA Annual Meeting, we will have an internet cafe with 14 terminals so par ticipants can check their e-mail. This cafe will be located in Level B of the CliffLodge at Snowbird. While there is no charge for use of the terminals to retrieve e-mail, the internet cafe is always very popular so we ask, in advance, that you be courteous and thoughtful of your colleagues when using this meeting amenity. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS This Preliminary Program is printed on recycled paper. Annual meeting activities are planned to emphasize recycling, water con servation, and other environmental concerns. As a resort, Snowbird has received several awards for ecological awareness and wise use of resources. ESA is working with Snowbird to ensure that ESA's annual meeting sets high environmental standards and continues to educate and inform those with whom we interact during the Annual Meeting. PRESS ROOM Media services are headquartered in the White Pine Room in the Cliff Lodge during ESA's Annual Meeting. ESA's Public Affairs Office staff will coordinate with members of the media. Each year, reporters, journalists, and radio and television correspon dents attend our annual meeting and report on the scientific pre sentations. This year, ESA's Public Affairs Committee is sponsor ing a symposium on Ecology in the Media and an evening session on Ecology on Film. All registrants should find these presenta tions of very special interest. For members of the media, the Press Office will be available for use by members of the media. Also, please plan to attend the Special Media Workshop on Emerging Issues-Sunday, August 6 from Noon to 1:00 p.m. AIRPORT SHUTTLE SERVICES Canyon Transportation will be handling shuttles to and from Salt Lake Airport and Snowbird. They will also run a shuttle to uni versity housing if this is desired. The round-trip discount price for LTER/ESA attendees at Snowbird is $34. The shuttles should be reserved in advance by calling 1-800-255-1841. Canyon runs shuttles 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. In order to receive a dis counted fare, you must identify yourself as an attendee at the LTER All-Scientists Meeting or the ESA 85th Annual Meeting. The shuttles leave the Salt Lake International Airport every half hour to 45 minutes. Between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., there are no minimums for the shuttle leaving the airport. Between 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. there is a three-person minimum for any shut tle trip. To pick up your Canyon Shuttle, proceed from the bag gage claim area to the Canyon Transportation desk.

Tram Tickets Riding the tram to the Mid-Gad station is a breathtaking way to enjoy the Canyon's majestic vistas and natural features. The gentle tram ride from the Sports Center to the mid-station is, itself, lots of fun. But there is more in store. From the Mid-Gad station, you can hike and picnic throughout the canyon following the hiking trails described in this Program. More information about hiking in the canyon is also available from the concierge at the Cliff Lodge. Meeting registrants who show their ESA or LTER meeting badges at the Tram station at the Sports Center are eligible to receive dis counts on tram passes. ORAL PRESENTATIONS-WHAT PRESENTERS AND PRESIDERS NEED TO KNOW Slide Preview Rooms At Snowbird, there will be two slide preview rooms-the Coat Closet in the Cliff Lodge, Level B, and the Columbine Room in the Sports Center.

These notes provide you with an introduction to the physical, biological, and cultural environment in the vicinity of Snowbird. We hope that dur ing your stay you will not only enjoy this scientific meeting, but also have an opportunity to get out and about, hiking this spectacular glaci er-carved canyon, exploring remnants of a mining industry that thrived more than a century ago, and simply enjoying the animals, plants, and geology of the region. Exploring Little Cottonwood Canyon Whether by foot, by car, or by tram, Little Cottonwood has much to offer for the ecologist and naturalist. More than 20 well-defined hike-ing trails can be found within the canyon. Most of these trails emerge from the main road and take you to beautiful vistas, lakes, and mountain peaks, or connect with adjacent canyons. All are maintained by the Forest Service and local hiking clubs. Pets are not allowed within the canyon. Vehicular access can take you from the canyon bottom up through alpine meadows, an elevational change of more than 1,500 m (4,700 feet). A third way to explore the canyon is by catching the tram. The Snowbird Tram operates throughout the summer and will take you from the Snowbird Resort Center, which is at approximately 2,600 m (8,000 feet), to the top of the top of the Wasatch Mountains (3,570 m, 11,070 feet). From the top of the Snowbird Tram, you can see 10 nearby peaks that are greater than 3,400 m (10,500 feet) in elevation (see map). Hiking trails. The best way to explore the canyon is on foot. The primary hiking areas are: RED PINE AND WHITE PINE TRAILHEAD: Located halfway up the canyon, this trail head and parking area provide access to the Lone Peak Wilderness Area and other peaks in the western portion of Litde Cottonwood Canyon Maybird Gulch Trail 3.8 miles 2,060 foot elevation change Red Pine Trail 4.5 miles 1,920 foot elevation change White Pine Trail 4.0 miles 2,300 foot elevation change Flagstaff Mountain Dromedary Sundial Peak 10,530' Davenport Hill Dromedary 10,360' 10,120' Twin Peaks 11107 Superior Peak 1 0,5 O'Sullivak iA Mt Wolverine 10,795' 1 1, 275' _&gt; Pioneer Peak Snowbird ; 10,480' Salt Mt Baldy Albion Sunset Lake Red Pne 11,068 Basin jPeak White Pine J10,648' city trailhead N Twin Peaks W E 1 1489' Lone Peak 11,253' Little White Baldy PMatterhorn 11,321' Figure 1. Peaks surrounding Peak Little Cottonwood Canyon. 21</page><page sequence="22">ALTA AND SNOWBIRD: In this part of the canyon you can see mine spoils and other indications of the gold-silver mining activities that dominated the canyon a century ago. Alta-Brighton Trail 3.5 miles 1,270 foot elevation change Gad Valley Trail 3.7 miles 2,830 foot elevation change ALBION BASIN: Located in the upper portion of Little Cottonwood Canyon, the Basin offers many trails to the nearby peaks and lakes; Albion Basin has spectacular alpine meadows with several dozen species in flower at this time of the year. Cecret Lake Trail 0.8 miles 400 foot elevation change Lake Mary Trail 1.9 miles 700 foot elevation change Automobile. For those without sufficient time to hike in Little Cottonwood Canyon, it is possible to drive as far as into Albion Basin (3,000 m). Here you will see beautiful alpine meadows, filled with dozens of flowering plants at this time of the year. Snowbird Tram. For those who enjoy hiking, but prefer a more leisurely experience, try taking the Snowbird Tram to the top and then hiking back down to the Snowbird Resort. This hike, along a gravel road used for maintenance, can be completed in about two hours. Geography From the terminus of the Snowbird Tram (3,570 m, 11,068 feet) on the southern crest of the Little Cottonwood Canyon drainage basin (see map), you can see the Uinta Mountains to the east and the Great Salt Lake and desert regions to the west. The Uintas are an east-west extension of the Rocky Mountains and reach heights in excess of 4,500 m (14,000 feet). To the west, the Great Salt Lake is at approx imately 1,340 m (4,150 feet). Glacial activity. Little Cottonwood Canyon with its U-shaped val ley was fully glaciated during the Last Glacial Maximum as was near by Bells Canyon to the west and south of Lone Peak. Both contain extensive cirques, including Cecret Lake in Albion Basin. Big Cottonwood Canyon is the next major canyon to the north of Little Cottonwood Canyon; it contained several glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum, but these glaciers were restricted to the upper por tions of the canyon. Mines. Gold and silver were discovered during the latter half of the 19th century. Alta became a bustling town, at times with more than 10,000 inhabitants and a narrow gauge railroad that brought supplies and miners from the canyon floor. All that remains today of this era are mine spoils and a few indications of where the train tracks snaked up the canyon. Across the Wasatch in Park City, several silver mines are still active. Wilderness Areas. Preservation along the Wasatch Front took place just as the population was beginning to boom in the 1 970s. Several 22 federally-designated and protected wilderness areas exist nearby, including Lone Peak and Twin Peak Wilderness Areas in the western half of Little Cottonwood Canyon and the Mount Olympus Wilderness Area immediately to the north. Vegetation The vegetation in Little Cottonwood Canyon extends from a xeric oak-maple shrub in the lower portions of the canyon to alpine mead ows and krummholz in the upper reaches. There are clear and distinct differences in vegetation composition on north-facing versus south facing slopes, reflecting the strong influence of water on plant distri bution. Precipitation at the lowest portion of the canyon is about 500 mm annually, with amounts increasing to approximately 1,800 mm annu ally near Albion Basin. Most precipitation (-85%) falls during the winter and spring as snow, with summer thunderstorms occurring only sporadically. It is not uncommon for snow to fall as early as September or as late as June. The length of the growing season is largely dictated by the extent of the winter-spring moisture recharge. The vegetation on the south-facing slopes in lower parts of the canyon is often water stressed by midsummer. Plants commonly seen in Little Cottonwood Canyon: TREES IN THE UPPER CANYON Abies lasiocarpa (subalpine fir) Picea engelmannii (Englemann spruce) Pinusflexilis (limber pine) Popiilus tremuloides (quaking aspen) TREES IN THE LOWER CANYON Abies concolor (White fir) Acergrandidentatum (bigtooth maple) Juniperus osteosperma (Utah juniper) Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas fir) Quercus gambelii (Gambel's oak) RIPARIAN TREES Acer negundo (box elder) Alnus tenuifolia (alder) Betula occidentalis (river birch) Populus angustifolia (cottonwood) Salix drummondiana (blue willow) Salix exigua (willow) SHRUBS Bcrberis repens (Oregon grape) Ccrcocarpus ledifolius (curlyleaf mahogany) Pachistima myrsinites (mountain lover) Physo ca rpus ma lvaceus (mallow n ineb ark) Prunus virginiana (chokecherry) Ribes montigenum (alpine prickly currant Symphoricarpos oreophilus (mountain snowberry)</page><page sequence="23">FoRBs Aconitum columbianum (monkshood) Allium brandegei (Brandegee onion) Aquilegia caerulea (Colorado columbine) Arnica parryi (Parry arnica) Aster engelmannii (Engelmann aster) Caltha leptosepala (marsh marigold) Delphinium occidentale (duncecap larkspur) Epilobium angustifolium (fireweed) Lupinus argenteus (lupine) Mertensia arizonica (Arizona bluebell) Monardella odoratissima (cloverhead horsemint) Polemonium foliosissimum (leafy Jacob's ladder) Veratrum californicum (false hellebore) Viguiera multiflora (showy goldeneye) GRASSES AND SEDGES Agropyron scribneri (Scribner wheatgrass) Agropyron trachycaulum (splender wheatgrass) Bromus carinatus (mountain brome) Carex rossii (Ross sedge) Carex occidentalis (western sedge) Deschampsia cespitosa (tufted hairgrass) Juncus drummondii (Drummond rush) Poa alpina (alpine bluegrass) Stipa lettermannii (Letterman needlegrass) Trisetum spicatum (spike trisetum) FAUNA Depending upon the time of day, a hike in Little Cottonwood Canyon may reveal several species of wildlife. Among the most con spicuous mammals at all elevations will be chipmunks and possibly yellow-bellied marmots, the latter occurring on grassy slopes near rock outcrops. If they have not gone underground for the year, Uinta ground squirrels should be active. Sightings of mule deer and moun tain goats are fairly common. Pikas can sometimes be seen near rock piles and mine spoils in subalpine meadows. Red squirrels are com mon inhabitants of conifer stands. At dawn and dusk you may encounter a snowshoe hare in the herbaceous vegetation and aspen fringes of conifer patches. The oakbrush stands at lower elevations near the mouth of the canyon harbor a variety of bird species, including the rufous-sided towhee, black-capped chickadee, blue-gray gnatcatcher, chipping and vesper sparrow, western scrub jay, black-billed magpie, and northern flicker. At higher elevations look for mountain chickadees, Cassin's finch, gray-headed juncos and yellow rumped warbler in wooded areas, and Clarks nutcracker and pipits in subalpine meadows, the latter occurring especially near water courses. In the streams them selves you may see the American dipper. Overhead, you might some common raptors, including northern harrier, golden eagles, and red tailed or Swainson's hawk. Animals commonly seen in Little Cottonwood Canyon: BIRDS Anthus spinoletta (water pipit) Aphelocoma coerulescens (western scrub jay) Aquila chrysaetos (golden eagle) Buteojamaicensis (red-tailed hawk) Btiteo swainsoni (Swainson's hawk) Carpodacus cassinii (Cassin's finch) Cinclus mexicanus (American dipper) Circus cyaneus (northern harrier) Colaptes auratus (common/northern flicker) Dendroica coronata (yellow-rumped warbler) Empidonax oberholseri (dusky flycatcher) Junco caniceps caniceps (gray-headed junco) Nucifraga columbiana (ClarWs nutcracker) Parus atricapillus (black-capped chickadee) Parus gambeli (mountain chickadee) Pica pica (black-billed magpie) Pipilo erythrophthalmus (rufous-sided towhee) Polioptila caerulea (blue-gray gnatcatcher) Pooecetes gramineus (vesper sparrow) Selasphorusplatycercus (broad-tailed hummingbird) Spizella passerina (chipping sparrow) MAMMALS Eutamias umbrinus (Uinta chipmunk) Lepus americanus (snowshoe hare) Marmota flaviventer (yellow-bellied marmot) Microtus longicaudus (long-tailed vole) Mustela erminea (ermine) Ochotona princeps (pika) Odocoileus hemionus (mule deer) Oreamnos americanus (mountain goat) Peromycus maniculatus (deer mouse) Spermophilus armatus (Uinta ground squirrel) Tamiasciurus hudsonicus (red squirrel) Zapusprinceps (jumping mouse 23</page><page sequence="24">EXHIBITS, COFFEE BREAKS AND POSTER PUBS More than 60 exhibitors-commercial firms, government agencies, and non-profits-attend our annual meeting.

For many of us, membership in the Ecological Society of America-or any scientific or professional society-is important because it provides us with access to journals, colleagues, and opportunities for professional interaction or recognition. But membership in a scientific society also gives us opportunities to learn more about our discipline, to develop new professional interests, and to pursue more of an activist role both as a researcher and educator. How we choose to take advantage of these opportunities can have remarkable influences on our careers and profession. As access to journals and colleagues shifts to elec tronic communication, we face the challenge of evaluating what it is to be a member of the ESA and how to best take advantage of the opportunities that membership in the ESA provides. The ESA is clearly changing, but what we do and how well we do it depends on the continuing involvement of the membership. ESA PUBLIC PLENARY Wednesday, August 9, 8:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Dr. David Suzuki Ecology at the Millennium David T.

WORKSHOPS (WK), DISCUSSIONS (DIS), EVENING SESSIONS (EV), SEEDS EVENTS (SD), AND SPECIAL EVENTS/BY INVITATION ONLY (X) Workshops WK #1 Moving Towards a National Vegetation Classification System: Where We Are and Where We Are Going Vegetation Classification Panel Field Trip and Workshop. Friday, August 4, 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. Field Trip AND Saturday, August 5, 9:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m. Workshop. You Must Register for and Attend Both. Fee $80. Fee includes transportation and lunch on the first day and continen tal breakfast, lunch, beverages, and reception on the second day. Principal Organizers: David Glenn-Lewin,Chair, ESA Panel on Vegetation Classification, and Lori Hidinger, Program Manager, Sustainable Biosphere Initiative The ESA Panel on Vegetation Classification has been developing its recommendations for the floristic levels of national vegetation classification standards in "An Initiative for a Standardized Classification of Vegetation in the United States." These develop ing floristic standards and the physiognomic standards endorsed by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) present vegetation science the opportunity to have a nationwide standard for classifying existing vegetation. Without a nationwide stan dard, large amounts of data from different sources cannot be inte grated, compared, or evaluated. The panel emphasizes that a full classification can be realized only through the collaboration of government, academic, and private sectors. This classification will be used not only to classify and catalog plant communities, but also to establish habitat and ecological relationships among assemblages of species and to predict ecolog ical processes such as productivity, successional patterns, or other complex properties of natural phenomena. The classification will provide a consistent conceptual matrix for understanding and communicating the ecological context of a biotic element or of a management decision. We expect that such a classification system will play a prominent role in guiding research and resource con servation, extrapolating findings in ecosystem management and planning, and predicting outcomes of environmental change. This two-day workshop will provide participants the opportunity to work with the developing floristic standards and share the experiences of vegetation researchers using them in the field. The first day (Friday, 8/4) will consist of a field trip to several differ ent sites to discuss the use of the national vegetation classification standards in the field. The second day (Saturday, 8/5) will consist of a working session in which participants will get the opportuni ty to practice the approach in the standards and hear from others who are currently using it. Experience with data sets from other 33</page><page sequence="34">areas of the country will be presented to demonstrate experience in the application of the national classification system across a wide range of locations. The target audience for this workshop includes working professional vegetation scientists and active and educated users of vegetation classification. A lunch will be pro vided on the field trip and lunch will be provided on day two. A reception and informal poster session demonstrating how the national vegetation classification system is being used will cap off the workshop. At last year's Annual Meeting in Spokane, WA, the ESA Panel on Vegetation Classification hosted a field trip and workshop, "Using the Proposed National Standards for the Floristic Levels of Vegetation Classification in the United States: Associations and Alliances." It sold out. Vegetation scientists and practitioners requested that the panel host a similar workshop/field trip com bination again at the Snowbird, UT, meeting, applying the Classification Standards to a different type of vegetation. WK #2 Assessment of Student Learning: Implementation of the Scholarship of Teaching And Research in Ecology (Biology) Education-Part I-Friday August 4, 1:30 p.m.-4:30 p.m. AND Part 1I-Saturday, August 5, 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. You Must Register for and Attend Both. Fee $50, includes snacks and beverages both days, continental breakfast and lunch Saturday, and handouts. Organizers: Diane Ebert-May, Director, Lyman Briggs School, Professor, Botany and Plant Pathology, Michigan State University, and Julie Luft, Associate Professor, Center for the Advancement of Science Education, College of Education, University of Arizona Workshop Instructors: Diane Ebert-May, Michigan State University,Julie Luft, University of Arizona We invite faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to participate in an interactive workshop that explores various assess ment methods to understand student learning. Participants will ultimately identify an area of their own instruction to assess and design a study to understand their effectiveness in the classroom. As college/university faculty implement cooperative learning, problem-based learning, and inquiry-based approaches in their classrooms, it is critical to understand the impact of these instruc tional approaches on student learning. Traditional multiple choice tests reveal little about student learning and instructor effectiveness. Information collected about student learning should direct the improvement of one's instruction, be dissemi nated to peers, and "count" toward teaching and research respon sibilities, especially since the scholarship of teaching is being defined by faculty at colleges and universities. We will explore and suggest mechanisms to expand current teaching and research agendas. This workshop is based on current research on the con struction of knowledge and assessment of learning. The presenters 34 have developed innovative assessment strategies through grants funded by the National Science Foundation and the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science Program, Department of Education. Summary materials will be provided for all workshop participants and links made to the ESA Education web site. For more infor mation contact: Diane Ebert-May, Michigan State University, 517-432-7171, bertmay@pilot.msu.edu This workshop is sponsored by the Education Section of the Ecological Society of America, Bruce Grant, Chair; Diane Ebert May, Past-Chair. WK #3 The Art of Giving an Outstanding Oral Presentation. Saturday, August 5, 10:00 a.m.-Noon. Fee $8, includes coffee, light snacks, and handout materials. Maximum 50. Principal Organizer: Todd Wellnitz, Department of Biology, Colorado State University, and Nancy McIntyre. Do you dread public speaking? Are you subject to "butterflies," stage fright, and mumbling speech? Does the fascination you have for your research fail to come through in your talks? Have you ever noticed the way an excellent talk can rejuvenate and energize a sleepy audience? Conversely, have you experienced the dreary disappointment of listening to someone who does interesting work but is unable to present it well? The ability to give an outstanding, effective, and professional pre sentation is an essential skill for an ecologist. Equally important, an oral presentation is an excellent means of spreading the word about your research and yourself. A great talk makes a great impression, and whether you are a graduate student or an estab lished researcher, it is indispensable that you convey your findings to your colleagues in a clear, concise and exciting manner. Putting together a good, solid, engaging talk pays. This workshop is designed to acquaint participants with effective techniques for developing and presenting an outstanding talk. The workshop will consist of three parts: 1) Structuring an Exceptional Talk; 2) You the Presenter; and 3) Engaging Visuals. Specific top ics will include organizing the flow of information, useful speaking styles, tricks for keeping your audience engaged, and putting together show-stopping slides. Short demonstrations will illustrate compelling presentation styles and good slide composition, as well as things you should never do when giving a talk. This workshop will be an interactive presentation in which the attendees are encouraged to share experiences, questions and knowledge. WK #4 Using Undergraduate Class Projects for Long Term Research. Saturday, August 5, 1:00 p.m.-3:00 p.m. Fee $8, includes soft drink and afternoon snack. Maximum 50. Principal Organizer: Harold Ornes; Southern Utah University Co-organizers: Kate Grandison, Bill Romey, and Helen Chuang, Department of Biology, Southern Utah University</page><page sequence="35">With continued emphasis on undergraduate research, professors find difficulty in trying to maintain a separate, professional, pro ductive research program and a productive undergraduate research program. Some professors are finding success with creat ing long term data sets from classroom-generated student pro jects. Some professors report wonderful success both in terms of student learning and in terms of publishable results. Other professors are finding student/faculty research more prob lematic. This workshop will serve as a platform for sharing both the success stories and the failure stories and try to address strate gies that consider the size, mission, and goals of the institution, the rank and career expectations of the professor, the student career goals, the educational value to the students, and the scien tific merits of such long term data collecting efforts. The objective of this session is to share ideas for active and pro ductive student learning through projects that are a part of the instructor's own research. The organizers of this session have found that assigning student classroom projects related to their own on-going research helps accomplish three student (and facul ty) learning objectives. The learning objectives are to (1) gain new knowledge, (2) practice using that knowledge in a context, and (3) communicate the knowledge and experiences to peers and/or professionals. WIC #5 Suslainabbe Biodives in the lnterratonal Arena. Saturday, August 5, 9:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m. Fee $15, includes cof fee and breakfast breads and a bag lunch. Principal Organizers: Dennis Ojima, Robin Reid, and Richard Wetzler This workshop will deal with the interface between conservation and ecosystem goods and services: How do we protect the bios phere and maintain sustainable resource use. Issues: There is a continued debate between ecological communi ties that focus on the protection of biodiversity of an area and those that focus on maintaining ecosystems for human use. This conflict is being waged in many parts of the world today. The conflict is driven by a need to push for policies that protect the biosphere, human actions striving for greater extraction of resources from our biosphere, and an ecological community unable to clearly define the state of the biosphere and how to assess the good and services being provided by the biosphere and how best to maintain the critical components of the biosphere to maintain the services. Thus, in developing countries, methods that develop a sound integrated strategy that maintains the fulnctioning of ecosystems in providing critical goods and provides resolution of these con flicts need strong interactions with social sciences to develop appropriate strategy for land resource use, sustainable develop ment, and maintenance of ecosystem goods and services. A set of breakout groups will examine ways to improve integra tion of ecological perspectives for developing sustainable bios phere plans, to discuss ways to integrate studies that link biodi versity measurements with ecosystem studies; define the role which biodiversity plays in maintaining ecosystem goods and ser vices; and develop networks among ESA members. Morning Session a. Sustainable biosphere and biodiversity issues, Scott Collins b. Defining biosphere/ecosystem goods and services, Gretchen Daily c.

Integrated analysis approaches, Dennis Ojima WK #6 Crossing the Moat II: Using Ecosystem Services to Communicate Ecological Ideas Beyond the Ivory Tower. Saturday, August 5, 1:00 p.m.-4:00 p.m. Fee $8, includes light afternoon refreshments. Maximum 60. Principal Organizers: Rhonda Kranz, ESA, Nancy Cole, Union of Concerned Scientists The science behind ecosystem services helps elucidate the con nections between actions taken by people and the results these actions have on those things they care about, such as clean air and water, fresh produce, and scenic beauty. Although there is still much to learn about the ecological processes involved in many ecosystem services, substantial understanding of many services and the scientific principles underlying them already exists. Building on the scientific underpinnings currently established, we can make this information accessible and motivating to the pub lic-and deliver the information in the most credible and persua sive manner possible. This workshop is the second in a series of workshops on the Ecosystem Services Communication Project, a project organized by the Ecological Society of America (ESA) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). The Project generates a series of sci entifically-based information packets about key ecosystem ser vices that are designed to be disseminated to the public and poli cy makers through members of the scientific community. At last year's meeting, the first two packets-on pollination and water purification-were presented and discussed. At this workshop, we will (1) provide an update on the Project; (2) present and solicit feedback on three new sets of ecosystem service packets; and (3) sponsor a training session on effectively using the packets. The training session will provide practical tips for making the most of the material and relating it to your own region and circumstances. 35</page><page sequence="36">The workshop participants will provide their perspectives and concerns on the specific material and on the project as a whole. Representatives from the policy, NGO, and media arena will be present to provide their perspectives as potential audiences for the material. In preparation for the workshop, registered participants will have received the information packets and a series of thought provoking questions. WK #7 Funding at NSF: Where and How to Dig for Buried Treasure. Saturday, August 5, 4:30 p.m.-6:30 p.m. Fee $3, includes soft drink and handouts. Principal Organizer: Samuel M. Scheiner, Div. of Env. Biol. National Science Foundation Learn the ins and outs of NSF and other funding sources. Learn about all the new competitions (e.g., NEON and IRCEB), as well as funding in the core programs. Program officers, former pan elists, and successful grantees will lead a discussion and question and answer session about how to wend your way through the NSF grant application system. Program directors from Ecosystem Studies, Ecology, Long-Term Ecological Research, Population Biology, and Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology will talk about both their programs and special competitions and oppor tunities at NSF. Former panelists will present their views on what makes a good proposal. This session will be useful both for new investigators and for old hands who wish to learn about what is up and coming. We especially encourage graduate students and post-docs who want to learn about dissertation and post-doctoral funding opportunities. If you say the secret word, the duck may come down and give you a grant. WK #8 Introduction to ESA (Open to all, but especially for new and prospective members.). Saturday, August 5 5:30 p.m.-6:30 p.m. No Charge ESA is a scientific society with a long and illustrious history and an exciting future. Active members in ESA enjoy the opportunity to share their research, forge lasting professional relationships, improve their career options, and serve their profession and the greater public good. For new and prospective members, this ses sion will enable you to get a jump-start on realizing member ben efits from the numerous programs and publications offered by ESA. An overview of the Ecological Society will be given by sev eral members of the Governing Board, Society leadership, and ESA headquarters staff. WK #9 Emerging Issues in Ecology (For Members of the Press and Media). Sunday, August 6,Noon tO 1:00 p.m. No Charge Principal Organizers: Rick Borchelt (ESA Public Affairs Committee Member), Manager, Media Relations, Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corporation,Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Nadine Lymn, ESA Director of Public Affairs, Allison Gillespie, ESA Public Affairs Officer 36 Press interest and coverage of ecology and ESA have been steadi ly increasing. However, while members of the press have told Public Affairs Office staff they find ESA meetings stimulating, they are often confounded in seeking out ecological information that ties into the news agenda at the time of the meeting. It is in the interest of the Society to offer reporters a special workshop designed to address this need. Reporters attending annual meetings of scientific societies increas ingly report that the "news" has dissipated from most of the ses sions before the meeting ever occurs, a victim of early publicity about the program (allowing reporters to talk to key speakers far in advance of the meeting), and of even earlier deadlines for approv ing program items, usually as much as six months in advance. The "news" of six months ago is unlikely to be of interest to reporters in attendance; conversely, there may be pressing ecological issues on the news agenda at the time of the annual meeting that are in no way reflected in the program. The workshop addresses this gap between news needs and program logistics. WK #10 Connecting Ecological Information: The National Biological Information Infrastructure and Ecologists. Monday, August 7, 1:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m. Fee $5, includes light afternoon refreshments. Maximum 60. Principal Organizer: Anne Frondorf, U.S. Geological Survey Confirmed speakers include Aaron Ellison of Mount Holyoke College, John Porter of the University of Virginia, John Schnase of NASA, and Michael Frame, Anne Frondorf, and Gary Waggoner of the U.S. Geological Survey. The National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) is a broad and collaborative initiative to develop a distributed, Internet based federation of biological and ecological information. The NBII links scientific information sources across the United States and throughout the world. This workshop will describe the ongo ing effort to build the NBII http://www.nbii.gov and will focus par ticularly on applications of this distributed scientific information network for the ecological community. The workshop will explore how ecologists can take greater advantage of advances in informa tion technology to become better at connecting and communicating ecological information among themselves, with other scientific dis ciplines, with resource managers, with students and teachers, and with the general public. Attendees will be encouraged to discuss their views on the barriers to and needs for sharing ecological data and what new tools they need to help meet these needs. While the NBII program is administered by the U.S. Geological Survey, the effort depends on the active participation of many agencies, organizations, institutions, and individuals. NBII part ners in government, academia, private industry, and the non profit community are working together to accomplish several related goals:</page><page sequence="37">* to make significant environmental information from many sources more broadly available; * to develop jointly new types of tools and information stan dards that make it easier to locate and access data and infor mation on species, ecosystems, selected biological themes or topics, or by geographic location; * to aggregate and integrate information that is managed in different forms and formats by different organizations; * and to better use this great wealth of existing information as a tool in research, for natural resource management, in land use planning and decision making, in education, and a myr iad of other applications. A panel of speakers from the academic research community and from government science agencies will address the follow ing topics: * What are the objectives of the NBII effort? What types of environmental data and information are available from this network? How is the NBII program working with existing ecological monitoring and research networks, such as the LTER network? * How and why should ecologists participate in this pro gram? How can ecologists influence the development and capabilities of the NBII? How can ecologists use the NBII as a source of environmental data and information and to help share and communicate the ecological information they develop with others? * What types of innovative technological applications for dis covering, integrating, and applying environmental data and information are being developed through the NBII program? * What is the vision for the "Next Generation" NBII, as rec ommended by the President's Committee of Advisors in Science and Technology? * How is the NBII connecting to other environmental infor mation networks at the international level, such as the pro posed Global Biodiversity Information Facility? We have the ability to harness technology to truly connect our information across organizations, across disciplines, and across multiple temporal and spatial scales. Ecologists, both individual ly and collectively through groups such as ESA, can play a vital role in the development and growth of the current NBII-and in the design of the NBII's next generation. This workshop will help stimulate these collaborations. WK #11 Integrating Disciplines to Understand and Address Problems in Invasive Species. Organized by ESA, the Collaboratory on the Population Biology of Invasive Species and the Nature Conservancy. Tuesday, August 8, 8:00 a.m.-Noon. Fee $5 covers coffee and light morning snacks. Organizers: Ann Sakai and Stephen Weller, University of California-Irvine Can basic research in population biology and related disciplines help us to understand and mitigate the impacts of invasive species on native species and ecological systems? Many land managers remain unconvinced of the value of basic research to solve man agement problems. Similarly, many basic researchers are skeptical of the value of using invasive species and invaded communities as research systems to answer fundamental ecological and evolution ary question. The goal of this workshop is to further the dialogue that enriches scientists' understanding of the application of their basic research to mitigation of the impacts of invasive species on native species and ecosystems. Developing national policies and programs on invasive species are elevating federal efforts to counter the harmful impacts of invasive species on biological diversity. Effective action, however, will depend on sound scientific knowledge. Elizabeth Chornesky (Director of Conservation Research, The Nature Conservancy) will identify where and how more fundamental research in the pop ulation biology of invasive species can make a critical contribution to applied action. For example, basic research may aid in setting pri orities to prevent or suppress the most ecologically harmful species and to protect the most vulnerable ecological systems. Many vectors are capable of introducing alien species into aquat ic systems. To reduce the number of introductions, one obvious strategy is to reduce the number and movement of vectors, but this often has high costs because many vectors are associated with commerce. David Lodge and Cindy Kolar (University of Notre Dame) will talk about a complementary strategy involving basic research-targeting scarce management resources on species and vector management practices that constitute a higher than average risk. On-going research suggests it is more possible than most ecologists realize to identify high risk species. Predicting invasive ability of plants is both a theoretical issue and an applied problem. Sarah Reichard (University of Washington) will discuss how combining the theory of population biology and practical knowledge of horticulture has resulted in the develop ment of both predictive statistical models and an accurate and easy-to-use decision tree. Robert Cabin (USFS Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry) will discuss research to understand and mitigate the effects of alien species and to facilitate regeneration and establishment of native species in Hawaiian dry forests that have been severely fragmented and degraded. This research has been designed and conducted in close collaboration with the Kona Dry Forest Working Group, a diverse collection of landowners, government and non-profit agen cies, and concerned local citizens. General methods for facilitating scientific/land management interactions will also be discussed. Woodlands of Tamarix spp. are now the most abundant riparian vegetation type in the US Southwest. Many Tamarix control pro jects emphasize elimination of Tamarix via herbicides or biocon trol insects and do not address the underlying factors that result 37</page><page sequence="38">ed in the displacement of the native forest species. Juliet Stromberg (Arizona State University) will discuss evidence that the re-establishment of native riparian species can be facilitated in some riparian corridors by restoring appropriate stream-flow regimes and herbivory patterns. The ecological consequences of eliminating Tamarix without simultaneously restoring physical site conditions and processes will be discussed. Developing predictive spatial models requires detailed informa tion on species biology, soil resources, level and type of distur bance, topography, and connectivity. Thomas Stohlgren (US Geological Survey) will discuss basic needs of land managers and new approaches in understanding the ecology of exotic plant species in complex landscapes. A primary focus is evaluating "uncertainty" associated with these spatial models. Kimberly With (Bowling Green State University) will discuss how invasive species can alter landscape structure and dynamics and make the landscape susceptible to further invasion. Fragmented landscapes are dominated by sink habitat, in which populations are sustained by immigrants from unfragmented source populations. Adaptations by native species in response to an invasive species may be swamped by immigrants from outside populations. A landscape perspective is thus ultimately required to understand the source-sink dynamics of populations and whether landscape management can restore population sinks to population sources for native species. Managing or restoring land scapes so as to preserve overall habitat connectivity may help to minimize the spread of invasive species across landscapes. WK #12 How to Find Your Niche: Career Options in Ecology. Tuesday, August 8, 3:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m. No Charge Where do you want to take your interest and training in ecology? In addition to academia and educational settings, increasingly there are career paths that utilize ecological degrees in new ways, both in governmental and non-governmental organizations, science cen ters, and industry. Building on the successful ESA publication describing careers in ecology, this workshop will bring together panelists whose degrees in ecology have been a springboard to diverse and rewarding directions. Come and explore your own options with those who have traveled the "road less taken." EVENING SESSIONS There is No Charge for attending Evening Sessions, but we Do Ask You to indicate your intention to attend specific sessions. EV #1 ESAISBI International Activities Roundtable. Sunday, August 6, 7:30 p.m.-9:00 p.m. Organizers: Mary Barber, SBI Director; Ron Slangen, SBI Staff Christine French, Moderator The 1991 Sustainable Biosphere Initiative (SBL) Report estab lished a research agenda for ecologists in the 1 990s and beyond. This agenda was developed under three themes: Global Change, Biodiversity, and Sustainable Ecological Systems. The SBI/ 38 Science Program Office has undertaken projects to forward research and information exchange in these areas, however, these projects have primarily been focused in the U.S. Now the ESA and its SBI/Science Program Office are interested in exploring how the Society can become more involved in international eco logical research and related activities. The 1991 International Sustainable Biosphere Initiative (ISBI) and the release of the report, A Sustainable Biosphere: The Global Imperative based on the 1991 ESA/SBI Report provided ecologists with a conceptual frame work for international extension. This roundtable discussion will seek to address the following questions: How can the research themes established by the 1991 SBI Report be extended for inter national application amongst ecologists? What types of activities can the ESA/SBI develop, support, or be more involved with, to accomplish this type of international effort? All are welcome to attend and provide thoughts and comments. EV #2 Perceptions of Ecology: Bridging the Gap Between Academia and the Public Through Education. Sunday, August 6, 7:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Organizers: Dr. David Slingsby, Chair of the Education, Training and Careers Committee of BES, Michael J. Mappin, ESA Education and Human Resources Committee Coordinator, and Dr. Alan Berkowitz, VP ESA Education &amp; Human Resources Societies such as ESA and the British Ecological Society (BES) have an important and critical role in bridging the gap between academia, education systems, and the general public in their per ceptions of ecology. This special working session with the Chair of the Education, Training and Careers Committee of BES will review some of the initiatives through which the BES is attempt ing to address this issue. This working session will also provide a forum for ESA members to share ideas and discuss initiatives to address this issue in North America. The British public's understanding of and perceptions of ecology owes more to environmental pressure groups and a sensationalist popular press than it does to academic science. It is often sug gested that the scientific community needs to communicate more effectively with the public, not only for altruistic reasons but because it relies at least in part on state funding. The nearest most members of the public get to knowing an ecologist may well be their school science teacher, so education has an important part to play in bridging the gap. Academic ecology needs schools not only to win the support and respect of the public, but as a source of students to keep university departments in business. Effective university teaching might also be enhanced by greater awareness of the ever-changing education system within which tomorrow's ecologists have been nurtured. In this working session, Dr. Slingsby will explore the differences in perception of ecology, as seen by the academic scientist, as projected through the public education system and through the mass media. The presentation will also highlight initiatives developed by the BES to address this</page><page sequence="39">problem of perceptions. The session will end with a working dis cussion on the state of this issue in North America and how ESA and its members, might expand upon existing initiatives, or develop new initiatives to address this issue. EV #3 The Rules Have Changed! Scientific Publishing in the Electronic Age. Sunday, August 6, 7:30 p.m. 9:30 p.m. Principal Organizer: Kay Gross Speakers: Mike Rosenzweig (University of Arizona), EiC Evolutionary Ecology Research; Steve Carpenter (University of Wisconsin) Chair, Science Board, Resilience Alliance; Lenore Fahrig (Carleton University) Associate Editor, Conservation Ecology; Sarah Michalak (University of Utah) SPARC Steering Committee The ways in which we communicate and publish our science have changed dramatically over the past decade. Not only have the print journals that would be appropriate outlets for ecological sci ence increased, but the format and delivery system has been rev olutionized. Electronic access to journals, which was considered futuristic and visionary less than a decade ago, is now available for almost every "print journal" we use. Fully electronic journals are also carving out a niche in this field, providing opportunities for novel ways of presenting our science as well as fostering collabo rations with scientists in other disciplines. The market place for scientific publications is becoming ever more complex and com petitive, creating both opportunities and risks (challenges?) for society-based and specialized, independent scientific journals. The speakers in this panel will address a range of issues related to the challenges and opportunities facing scientific publication in the "electronic age." The rules have changed, but the goals remain the same. EV #4 How Can I Run a Successful Field Course? Sunday, August 6, 7:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m. August 6, 7:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Organizer: Alan Stam, Dept. of Biology, Capital University There is a recognition among ecologists that field experiences are invaluable educational components in the training of students to become ecologists. While this is the case, there is very little pro fessional interaction among this group of professionals that facil itates the development and improvement of field courses. The purpose of this discussion is to address the question, How can I run a successful field course? The discussion will include (1) the ways in which courses can be initiated and how to deal with accompanying logistical chal lenges; (2) the merits of different educational approaches to field courses; and (3) ways to evaluate learning outcomes. It is hoped that a product of the discussion will be the develop ment of an ongoing exchange of information which will benefit those who are presently involved in, and those who would like to become involved in, teaching a field course. EV #5 Ecological Research Funding Opportunities (How to Get Paid for Playing in the Mud): Focus on Defense Programs. Monday, August 7, 7:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Maximum 100. Organizers: Mary Barber, SBI Director; Ron Slangen, SBI Staff; William Goran, SERDP Program Manager This session is the first of a series that ESA plans to sponsor at its annual meetings. The series aims to highlight grant-funding pro grams related to ecological research. Sessions are targeted at grad uate students, post-docs and looking to be post-docs, and young faculty members interested in learning more about funding opportunities. This year we highlight three Department of Defense (DOD) pro grams that are of particular interest: 1) The Legacy Program pro vides funding for projects related to regional ecosystem manage ment initiatives, integrated natural resources management, inva sive species control, monitoring and predicting migratory pat terns of birds and animals, national and international initiatives, and other related topics in land management. 2) The Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) is the DOD environmental research and development program that undertakes numerous research and technology development pro jects related to the management of military lands and activities from an ecosystem perspective. In particular, they focus on envi ronmental cleanup, conservation, compliance, and pollution pre vention issues. 3) The SERDP Ecosystem Management Project (SEMP) falls under the SERDP Program Office and was created to address the research needs that identify and understand rele vant ecosystem change and status indicators that are relevant to military land management concerns and can be incorporated into the ongoing monitoring program. The results of these programs contribute to management of the 25 million acres of DOD owned land. There will be ample time for discussion, as well as plenty of take home materials and special exhibits highlighting other funding programs. Please come and join us for this special event. Agenda: 7:30 p.m.-7:40 p.m. Introduction Mary Barber Director, SBI/Science Program Office at ESA 7:40 p.m.-8:00 p.m. SERDP Program Presentation with Q&amp;A Robert Hoist, SEDRP Program Manager, Conservation 8:00 p.m.-8:20 p.m. SEMP Program Presentation with Q&amp;cA William Goran, SEMP Program Manager 8:20 p.m.-8:40 p.m. Legacy Program Presentation with Q&amp;A Alison Dalsimer, Legacy Resource Management Scientist 8:40 p.m.-9:00 p.m. Discussion on programs and next year's focus 39</page><page sequence="40">EV #6 Ecological Indicators for the Nation: What Is the Smallest Number We Can Live With? (NRC Report). Monday, August 7, 8:00 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Moderated by Gordon Orians This presentation will begin with a summary of the rationale and results of the recently-completed National Research Council study on Ecological Indicators chaired by Dr. Orians. The goal of that study was to devise a small number of indicators whose input data could be amalgamated into national-level indicators with the potential of attracting national attention and influencing nation al policy. The study committee operated under the assumption that part of the reason that ecological indicators have not attract ed public attention is that there have been far too many of them. Nonetheless, seriously reducing the number of indicators inevitably means that many topics are omitted. The purpose of the session is to engage interested ecologists in a discussion of the indicators the committee recommended and to explore how these proposed indicators might be further refined and made fully oper ational, and thereby become an influential part of the national environmental, policy agenda. EV #7 Freshwater Equity White Paper Review. Monday, August 7, 8:00 p.m.-9:00 p.m. Principal Organizers: Jill Baron and Rhonda Kranz Aquatic ecosystems are being severely altered or destroyed at a greater rate than at any other time in human history, and far faster than they are being restored. Because freshwater is vital to human life and the entire human enterprise, societal access and manipu lation of freshwater supplies for consumption, irrigation, and transport have long taken precedence over more subtle goods and services provided by freshwater ecosystems. There is growing recognition that the benefits provided by functional aquatic ecosystems, such as purification, food supply, or flood control, are costly if not impossible to replace once gone. Maintenance and restoration of the integrity of water resources, including the plants and animals that comprise aquatic, wetland, and riparian food webs, is increasingly recognized as a legitimate use of freshwaters, worthy of consideration in debates over sustainable water resource allocation. The Ecological Society of America has established a committee to develop a paper that would describe and, where possible, quanti fy, the needs freshwater ecosystems have for adequate water quan tity, quality, and hydroperiodicity. The presentation will include a discussion of the consequences of threats to aquatic ecosystem structure and function, a brief discussion of how alteration of freshwater systems influences human society, and case studies that illustrate both detrimental impacts and efforts that have resulted in a more equitable distribution of water resources for fresh water ecosystems. At this discussion, Jill Baron, lead author of the White Paper will be joined by her co-authors to lay out the organization and 40 themes of the draft paper. Attendees will be invited to comment on and discuss the topic and the paper. EV #8 Environmental Justice Workshop. Monday, August 7, 7:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Organizers: George Middendorf, Department of Biology, Howard University, Washington, DC; Bruce Grant, Department of Biology, Widener University; Leanne Jablonski, University of Dayton; Charles Nilon, Dept. of Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences, University of Missouri-Columbia Environmental justice focuses on how environmental effects are distributed differently among different groups of humans and emphasizes the role of public policy and process in this variation. This distributional issue adds another level of analysis to the interpretation of ecological and environmental information by asking that ecologists examine both how human actions influence ecosystem structure and function and how environmental deci sion-making process affects society. Environmental justice issues thus comprise essential and greatly overlooked applications of ecological knowledge to the tasks of improving the ecosystem design of our human-built world. This workshop will provide ecological educators with classroom techniques and examples they can use to include environmental justice themes and approaches in their ecology and introductory biology courses. Participants in this workshop will obtain resources and learn stu dent-active analytical methods to teach students how to under stand human ecosystems and thereby comprehend the resource and waste risk distributional inequities that constitute environ mental injustice. Participants will also learn how to engage their students in service learning to empower them to find solutions to environmental injustices in their own communities. We note that inclusion at the introductory level of Environmental Justice themes should also serve to attract students, particularly those from under-represented groups, into ecological and environmen tal careers. EV #9 Ecology in Film: Video Screenings. Tuesday, August 8, 8:00 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Join your fellow ESA members for an evening of on-screen sci ence. We'll be taking a look at some documentaries on ecological topics, including some created by speakers in the Ecology in Media Symposium. What could be better-popcorn, beer (cash bar) and ecology on film. EV #10 Setting Priorities for Invasive Species: The State of Knowledge. Tuesday, August 8, 8:00 p.m.-9:00 p.m. Principal Organizers: Lori Hidinger Program Manager, Sustainable Biosphere Initiative, and William Gregg, USGS Biological Resources Division</page><page sequence="41">The panelists will be drawn from the authors of the report and members of the project's steering committee: Laura Ahearn Meyerson, Yale University, Robert Cabin, U.S. Forest Service, James Carlton, Williams University, Elizabeth Chornesky, The Nature Conservancy, Carla D'Antonio, University of California, Berkeley, Lloyd Loope, USGS Biological Resources Division, Richard Mack, Washington State University, Hal Mooney, Standford University, Tom Stolhgren, Colorado State University. An expansion of global trade and increases in human mobility have resulted in the unprecedented establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in the United States. These biological "invasions" can produce severe, often irreversible impacts on native species and ecosystem processes. In February 1999, the President signed the Executive Order 13112 on Invasive Species directing federal agencies to use their authorities to prevent the introduction of invasive species, to control and monitor the spread of non-indigenous species, and to restore native species. It also established the National Invasive Species Council which has been tasked with preparing an invasive species management plan. To develop such a plan, the Council must have the most current scientific knowledge to support setting priorities for non-indige nous species management. The Ecological Society of America has partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey's Biological Resources Division and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop a summary review of the state of the knowledge and science on setting priorities for non indigenous species in the United States. The review will focus on assessing invasiveness and spread of non-native species (how to identify those species already in U.S. or those from other coun tries that are potential invaders and those ecosystems that are sus ceptible to invasion), changes over time, lag effects, the science of predicting problem species, an update on major vectors of inva sion, and the consequences of leaving some invasive species in an ecosystem. The review will look at the state of the knowledge on these topics-what do we know and not know? This discussion will present the results of the summary to date and elicit input from participants on the direction and content of the summary. EV #11 Climate Change and California Ecosystems: A Report by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Tuesday, August 8, 8:00 p.m.-9:00 p.m. Organizers: Rhonda Kranz, ESA and Peter Pfrumhoff, UCS This report breaks new ground as a synthesis of what the scientif ic community knows and doesn't know about the projected impacts of climate change on California, a state that is already stressed by population growth, suburban sprawl, spread of exotic invasive species, and other drivers of environmental change. The report, released in November 1999, was written by seven California-based global change scientists and ecologists produced jointly by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and the Ecological Society of America (ESA). California is often a bell wether state for new ideas and innovations, and what happens in California-at least indirectly-often affects everyone else in the country, from prices for fresh produce to air pollution standards. This is the first in a series of reports being produced by UCS and ESA on the projected ecological impacts of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems and biological diversity in spe cific regions of the United States. The next report-focusing on the Gulf Coast region-is expected to be completed in Spring 2001. These reports are being produced to provide scientists, key policy makers, NGOs, the media, and the public with a broader awareness of the importance of the climate change issue so that environmental policies that mitigate and begin adapting to cli mate change can be formulated and implemented. Authors of the report will be joined by Project steering commit tee members to describe the report's major findings, the process by which it was created, and the importance of the series in the overall context of climate change science and policy. An open dis cussion will follow. The report is available on the UCS (ucsusa.org) and ESA (esa.sdsc.edu) websites. EV #12 Towards Potential Synergies of Plant and Animal Ecophysiology. Tuesday, August 8, 7:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Principal Organizers: Vincent P. Gutschick, Dept. of Biology, New Mexico State University, and Martin E. Feder, President, Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology Dept. of Organismal Biology and Anatomy The University of Chicago Panelists: Steven C. Hand, University of Colorado, Chair, Division of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry, Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, Animal Ecophysiology; Dennis Bramble, University of Utah; Jim Coleman, Desert Research Institute, ESA member, Plant Ecophysiology; Arnold Bloom, University of California, Davis, member of American Society of Plant Physiologists; Vince Gutschick, Martin Feder, President, Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology Sponsorship by the section on Physiological Ecology, ESA The ESA section on physiological ecology has evolved to cover plant ecophysiology, to the virtual exclusion of animal ecophysi ology. The intellectual linkages that are possible between plant and animal ecophysiology are diverse and potentially very rich. The links have been suggested by a number of routes recently: by four of the proposed panelists exchanging e-mail and talking at SICB and AIBS meetings; by the organizer in his candidacy state ment for presidency of the Physiological Ecology Section; by NSF panel members in the Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology program and its predecessor, Functional and Physiological Ecology. Rob Jackson, the new PE section president, and panelist Jim Coleman, past PE president, asked the organizer to develop such a discussion group, to which he readily agreed. 41</page><page sequence="42">The proposed panelists would include two delegates from the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, namely, its pres ident and a chair of its Division of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry, and a member of the American Society of Plant Physiologists. The former two seek to examine whether the opportunity exists for formal or informal intellectual synergies between the largely plant ecophysiology community of ESA and the largely animal ecophysiology community of SICB. We pro pose a discussion of common intellectual frameworks as well as of joint application to major ecological issues, including assessing the safety of genetically modified organisms (plant-animal inter actions are prominent, as in the pollen-monarch butterfly story). A companion workshop is being proposed for the SICB meeting the following year. DISCUSSIONS DIS #13 Impacts of Science on Society: A Discussion for Researchers and Educators. Wednesday, August 9, 10:00 a.m.-Noon Principal Organizers: Lissa M. Leege, Georgia Southern University, Michael Hunt Jones and David Culver, Ohio State University As ecologists, we need and want to understand the effects of our research and technologies on society. We know the findings of our discipline have both direct and indirect impacts on the behavior of society, typically through the general information provided by news media. However, few of us are able to seek out in-depth or scholarly works that would provide us with the knowledge we need to be well-informed. The objectives of this session are three fold. We will (1) examine some examples of how science and soci ety influence one another, (2) demonstrate an on-line repository of resources we have developed to show these interconnections, and (3) facilitate a discussion of how our research affects society at large and devise strategies by which we can avoid the misuse and misinterpretation of our findings by the public. This discussion will be of particular interest to educators who wish to teach courses that place science within the context of the society in which it was developed. In addition, researchers con cerned about the impacts of their work on society are encouraged to attend. DIS #14 What DOES Cause Age-related Decline in Forest Productivity? Wednesday, August 9, 2:00 p.m.-4:00 p.m. Principal Organizers: Barbara Bond, Oregon State University, Michael Ryan, USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Station, Federico Magnani, Universita' della Basilicata, Potenza, Italy Virtually all even-aged forest stands follow a similar pattern of productivity. After a harvest or major disturbance, above-ground productivity initially increases as canopies of young trees grow and capture more light. Productivity reaches a maximum at about 42 the time of stand closure and subsequently declines. Very long term data sets indicate that productivity continues to decline through stand maturity and old growth stages. Although age-related growth decline appears to be universal, at least in even-aged stands, the mechanism(s) is (are) not known. Many forestry textbooks claim that the decline in productivity with age is caused by increased autotrophic respiration in growing trees, but experimental tests have failed to support this hypothe sis. Recently, several studies have been initiated to test alternate hypotheses, including nutrient limitations, hydraulic limitations and shifts in biomass allocation. There are examples to support each of these hypotheses, but to date there is no strong evidence to support any of them as a universal mechanism. The goals of this workshop are to share what is currently known about poten tial mechanisms responsible for age-related decline in forests and to identify the most urgent needs for new information. We can explain why productivity varies from one location to another due to differences in site conditions and species compo sition. We can also explain easily how expanding leaf area in developing stands allows increased capture of light, leading to increased productivity during early developmental stages of a for est stand. We cannot explain why above-ground productivity declines in older stands, we can only model it empirically. It is surprising that the mechanisms responsible for such a fundamen tal property of forest growth remains so elusive. Continuing dis cussion and interaction among scientists from a variety of disci plines is needed to unravel this problem SEEDS PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS (SD) Exclusively for SEEDS Program Participants and SEEDS Mentors SEEDS is a collaborative effort among the United Negro College Fund, the Ecological Society of America and the Institute for Ecosystem Studies that aims to increase the number of minority students choosing to major in ecology in college.

Organized by A.R. Berkowitz and C. Brewer. Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge When considering what are the enduring understandings in ecology we wish to engender in our students-be they undergraduate biology majors, future ecologists or future teachers-we are ill-served by the current structure of the curriculum or even the discipline (e.g., population ecology, community ecology, biomes, etc.). As a guide to radically new curriculum and instruction, from the design of single ecology segments of larger courses to the structure of undergraduate majors, we propose to identify the foundational "ways of thinking" that are essential tools of the ecologically literate person. Ultimately, we seek to define the overarching goal of ecology education-ecological thinking-by exploring its component parts and their integration. This symposium aims to begin that process, with each paper developing the substance and rationale for a different sort of thinking as an essential component of ecological thinking. Following the presentations, a panel will address these questions: I) Have we omitted critical "ways of thinking", including some that are not essential, and provided an adequate vision for their integration into ecological thinking, and 2) What are the implications of ecological thinking and its components, as defined herein, for curriculum and instruction? We plan to assemble the papers and commentary from the panel and submit them to Ecology for consideration as a Special Feature on Ecological Thinking and Education. Sunday, August 6, 2000 8:00 AM to 1 1:45 AM Symposium #2: Stressors in Western Mountain Ecosystems: Detecting Change and Its Consequences. Organized by D. L. Peterson and L. J. Graumlich. (Sponsored by the Public Affairs Committee.) Location: Ballroom 11 - Cliff Lodge Mountain ecosystems are experiencing increased levels of stress due to a variety of human impacts. Mountains of the western United States have been intensively used for habitation and resource extraction for the past century, and are now beginning to exhibit quantifiable signs of altered ecosystem patterns and processes. This symposium focuses on stressors that significantly impact mountain ecosystems, specifically: climatic variability, altered disturbance regimes, exotic species, air pollution, and human land use. These stressors are currently being studied through long-term research and monitoring programs in the western United States, but the results have not been reported concurrently. Each speaker in the symposium will address specific stressors and their effects for the major Western mountain ranges (Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Rockies). The result will be a state-of-the-art synthesis that melds the basic science underlying characterization of stress impacts with the applications of this knowledge for the design of detection strategies. The symposium will highlight long-term studies, and will provide a framework for evaluating the vulnerability of mountain ecosystems to stress. Sunday, August 6, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #3: Linking Communities Across Ecosystem Boundaries: A Symposium in Memory of Gary A. Polis. Organized by D.M. Sanzone. (Sponsored by the Aquatic Ecology Section.) Location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff Lodge Land-water margins, in addition to harboring unique communities of organisms, are areas of active exchange of organisms, organic matter, and nutrients between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Much of the research conducted at this land-water interface has focused on the unidirectional flow of energy and organisms from terrestrial watersheds to adjacent aquatic habitats. Recent studies, however, suggest that the translocation of energy, nutrients, and organisms from aquatic systems to the surrounding terrestrial landscape may be more important than traditionally thought. This has direct implications for how we model nutrient fluxes and food web interactions both within and across traditional ecosystem boundaries within the watershed. New experimental techniques, such as those that utilize stable isotopic tracers or persistent novel chemicals, coupled with newly developed theoretical concepts such as analysis of "resource sheds" and utilization of "perimeter to area ratios", can provide ecologists with new tools to model these trophic transfers and identify food web linkages at multiple scales. The purpose of this symposium is to synthesize findings from freshwater and marine studies in order to: I) Document the flow of energy and nutrients from aquatic to terrestrial habitats; 2) Determine if terrestrial consumers respond to this additional nutrient and energy subsidy; and 3) Determine how human alteration of the watershed might impact connectivity between these aquatic and terrestrial foodwebs.

Organized by R.S. Reid and K. Galvin. (Sponsored by the International Affairs Section.) Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge This symposium will explore the conceptual and practical challenges of balancing the goals of biodiversity conservation and human development in developing world contexts. Conservation and human development are often presented as conflicting goals, but new research on several continents shows that these goals can be brought together into a conceptual and practical whole. This research links long-term ecological and social science research with close practical work in communities and with policy-makers on the ground. Several speakers will highlight broad social forces that can either threaten or ensure biodiversity conservation, including land-use change, land tenure, institutional arrangements, and policy. These broad issues will be knit together with specific examples of when and where these goals can be aligned and when they cannot. Speakers will also emphasize practical tools that are being used to bring the best of ecological and social science research into the realm of policy at community, national and regional scales. The symposium will conclude with presentation of the conclusions of a workshop that precedes the ESA meeting and will synthesize principles that cut across sites on three continents. Sunday, August 6, 2000 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM Symposium #5: Incorporating Landscape Processes in Ecological Restoration. Organized by K.D. Holl, E.E. Crone and C.B. Schultz. (Sponsored by the Applied Ecology Section.) Location: Ballroom 11 - Cliff Lodge Current restoration activities often focus narrowly on sites actively being restored. The success of these restorations, however, will often depend upon their position in the landscape, relative to the condition, land use, and community composition of land in the surrounding area. Restoration ecologists have often discussed landscape-level processes in general. Nonetheless, theory has rarely led to recommendations that are put to use on the ground. In this symposium, we bring together speakers from both the academic and management community to discuss applying ecological theory to prioritize restoration decisions at a large-scale. Speakers will present results of their recent research on large-scale restoration and will address the following two questions: I) To what degree have you been able to predict or assess the effect of large-scale ecological processes on restoration success in your projects/research, and 2) Are there any tools for applying basic knowledge to prioritizing restoration efforts that you have found particularly useful (or useless) that might be more widely applied? Sunday, August 6, 2000 1:00 PM to 4:40 PM Symposium #6: Ecological Consequences of Adaptive Evolution Among Invasive Species in Terrestrial and Marine Systems. Organized by E. Grosholz and J. Maron. (Sponsored by the Long Term Studies Section.) Location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff Lodge Ecosystems throughout the world are being threatened by the invasion of introduced species. What permits certain introduced species to disrupt the systems into which they are introduced remains widely debated. Evidence is now accumulating that organisms placed in new environments can evolve rapidly, and that the resulting changes in phenotypic characters such as size, prey preferences or host usage can influence the strength of ecological interactions. For example, organisms can be larger in ?heir introduced versus native range; increased stature often may enhance competitive abiliq and therefore the likelihood of spread. The goal of this symposium is to present some of the exciting recent evidence that suggests that introduced organisms have altered phenotypes compared to native conspecifics. Speakers will evaluate whether changes in phenotype result from plasticity, founder effects, or from rapid evolution, and explore how altered phenotype may influence ecological interactions and invasibility. While ecological hypotheses for what makes organisms successful invaders are manifold, the importance of plasticit or evolutionary change in altering phenotypic characters that can facilitate invasion is often ignored. The objective of this symposium is therefore to provide a synthesis of both ecological and evolutionary hypotheses relating to invasion. The proposed symposium will bring together scientists who work on both plants and animals in marine and terrestrial systems. The broad representation of organisms and habitats will appeal to a broad range meeting attendees. In addition, the issues covered in this symposium ranging from predator-prey dynamics, and host plant-insect interactions to phenotypic evolution, will be of general broad interest to many in the society. This kind of approach, one that tackles an important problem in applied ecology by combining basic ecological and evolutionary approaches in very different systems, has been poorly represented by past symposia and contributed paper sessions. 46</page><page sequence="47">Monday, August 7, 2000 8:00 AM to 12: 10 PM Symposium #7: Thirty Questions for Ecology in the 2 I st Century. Organized by J. Gurevitch and N. Huntly. (Sponsored by the Awards and Research Committees.) Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge Borrowing from the famous address given in 1900 by the mathematician Hilbert that introduced a research agenda for mathematics for the 20th century, we consider ecologists' visions for ecological research in the 21st century. The purpose of the symposium is to recognize the coming century, stimulate the thinking of ecologists and encourage the development of new ideas and a broader perspective for ecological research for the new millenium. Ten ecologists each propose three leading questions for the next century of ecological research, to make a composite total of thirty questions drawn from a variety of perspectives. Speakers represent a broad range of career stages and research backgrounds. The questions range from evolutionary to applied and conservation ecology, from examining the usefulness of ecology to a call for action. Monday, August 7, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #8: Ten Years of the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative. Organized by Mary Barber and Pam Matson. (Sponsored by the SBI Committee.) Location: Ballroom 11 - Cliff Lodge Referred to as a "call-to-arms" for all ecologists, the ESA Sustainable Biosphere Initiatve (SBI) was published in 1990 and defined research priorities for ecology in the closing decade of the 20th century. The impetus for this bold endeavor was the increasing reality that the ecological community has a significant role to play in addressing environmental problems, in making ecological knowledge available to managers and decision-makers, and in improving the human condition. In this symposium, we will review some of the breakthroughs in ecology over the past decade that addressed SBI's objectives. We will also discuss ways that the SBI influenced ecological research funding and science policy in its three priority areas: Global Change, Biological Diversity, and Sustainable Ecological Systems. Finally, we will reflect on the SBI as a platform on which the next decade of research, management, and policy can be founded. Monday, August 7, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #9: The Water Limitation: Issues in Plant, Community, and Ecosystem Water Use. Organized by L. A. Donovan and J.S. Sperry. (Sponsored by the Southeastern Chapter.) Location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff Lodge Water is a limiting resource in most ecological systems. The symposium will present an up-to-date overview of the fast changing field of ecological plant water relations, integrating individual plant, community and ecosystem level approaches. At the individual plant level, there have been recent highly publicized challenges to the theory of how water moves through plants (cohesion theory) and the mechanisms of how plants recover from impairment of the water transport capacity (xylem refilling). Two of the speakers will critique these challenges, pointing out that the cohesion theory still stands, but that we need more research into the mechanisms of xylem refilling under conditions where plants are transpiring. Also at the individual plant level, two speakers will present the latest interpretations of stomatal responses to hydraulic vs. chemical signals from roots. Understanding the mechanism of stomatal responses to soil and atmospheric drought increase our ability to predict and manage plant water use. The remaining speakers will address the impact of individual plant water use on community and ecosystem level responses. Hydraulic lift is an apparently widespread phenomenon that redistributes water from one soil region to another via plant roots, and it has major implications for competition and total water use of plant communities. Hydraulic constraints on stomatal conductance may play a central role in the decline of productivity with forest age. Ecosystem level studies of water use indicate the extent to which controls on whole plant water use scale up to regional patterns and also reveal new controls operating at higher levels. Overall, the symposium will provide a summary of current debates and advances in the field of ecological plant water relations for ecologists with interests ranging from physiology to ecosystem biology. 47</page><page sequence="48">Monday, August 7, 2000 1:00 PM to 5:05 PM Symposium # I 0: Integrating Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology: Causes and Consequences of Spatial Heterogeneity in Ecosys tem Processes. Organized by M.G. Turner and F.S. Chapin, Ill. (Sponsored by the Vegetation Section.) Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge Understanding the patterns and causes of spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem function remains at the frontier of ecosystem and landscape ecology. Despite tremendous advances in understanding ecosystem processes over relatively small spatial extents, there exists very little theory for predicting variability in ecosystem processes across heterogeneous landscapes. Although the library of empirical data from a variety of regions is slowly building, we have no general answers to such questions as: I) Just how spatially variable are ecosystem processes, 2) How do the controls on processes and rates operate across space, 3) Are regional processes simply the area-weighted sum of the processes measured in component ecosystems, 4) Are there critical thresholds in spatial patterns that are important for ecosystem processes, 5) How do disturbance-generated patterns influence spatial dynamics of ecosystem processes, and 6) Do simple scaling rules work when we move from ecosystems to landscapes? Ecologists have long recognized that the abiotic template is a powerful constraint on ecosystem function. However, spatial processes such as land use, natural disturbance, and the activities of organisms also influence the rates and patterns of ecosystem processes. A more synthetic understanding of spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem processes remains an important research need, one which should include both theoretical development and empirical study. This symposium is designed to highlight a developing research area rather than synthesize a well-researched subject. The program will emphasize presentations by ecologists who are currently working at the interface between ecosystem ecology and landscape ecology. Each speaker will be asked to identify what s/he considers to be the most important questions or hypotheses for future research in this interface as part of their presentation. Monday, August 7, 2000 1:00 PM to 4:50 PM Symposium # I I: Urban Ecology: The Eastern and Western Perspectives. Organized by J. Wu and S. Pickett. (Sponsored by the Asian Ecology Section.) Location: Ballroom 11 - Cliff Lodge The urban environment represents ecological systems that are most drastically transformed by human activities. While only a few per cent of the global population lived in cities in 1800's, urban environments accommodate nearly 50% of the world population today. In the United States, 74% of the population resided in urban areas in 1989 while in 2025, 80% are projected to live in urban areas. While they are arguably the most important habitats for human survival, urban ecosystems, after being long ignored, only recently have begun to receive much deserved attention from ecologists. However, urban ecology is new to North America ecologists in several respects, and it is important to learn how urban ecology has long been studied in Asia and Europe. Thus, the goal of this symposium is to bring together a group of leading urban ecologists from Asia, Europe, and USA to discuss the history, scope, and methodology of urban ecology. This symposium will highlight the major historical developments, different perspectives, and theories and principles that are shaped by different physical and cultural landscapes. This symposium will help facilitate communications among ecologists in the USA and other parts of the world, and should be of great interest to many ESA members who are working on or concerned with urban environment. The presentations and subsequent publications by this group of leading urban ecologists will help clarify several issues of the scope and methodology of urban ecology. Monday, August 7, 2000 1:00 PM to 4:45 PM Symposium # 1 2: The Role of Ecology in Environmental Justice. Organized by B. Nilon and C. Grant. (Sponsored by the Education Section and the Education and Human Resources Committee.) Location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff Lodge Environmental justice is concerned with the distribution of environmental benefits and harms, and asks whether the procedures and impacts of environmental decision making are fair to the people they affect. This focus on distributional issues adds new layers of analysis to the fields of ecology and environmental science. Just as ecologists focus on understanding how human actions influence ecosystem structure and function, environmental justice focuses on how the environmental repercussions of human actions affect societal equilibrium. Given that many of the major U.S. environmental organizations have ignored the environmental health and needs of communities of color and low-income communities, the environmental justice movement has been very critical of conventional environmental initiatives. However, making the connection between environmental justice and ecology goes straight to the heart of resolving many of the conditions that lead to the current array of environmental problems, both inequities and injustices. Understanding the connection between ecology and environmental justice is also important to ecologists seeking to insure that the discipline of ecology remains central to the fields of environmental health and environmental science. Absent the integration of ecological understanding into the 48</page><page sequence="49">environmental decision-making process will ensure that future decisions will be politically but not ecologically influenced. In this session, leading ecologists and environmental justice advocates will explore the relationship between ecology and environmental justice. Papers in the session will also explore how an awareness of environmental justice will change the face of ecology. Tuesday, August 8, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #1 3: Ecology in the Media. Organized by P. Alpert and A. Gillespie. (Sponsored by the Public Affairs Committee.) Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge The most important way of communicating ecology to the public today is through the mass media. This symposium will showcase some of the best examples of media coverage of ecology, compare the advantages of the different media for communicating ecology, and discuss how most effectively to interest and inform people about ecological issues. For example, the "fireside not pulpit" proposition holds that, to avoid public fatigue with environmental programming, ecology in the media should tell more stories and deliver fewer sermons. The symposium speakers are science journalists, producers, and writers who have translated the work of ecologists into newspaper stories, magazine articles, radio broadcasts, and television shows, plus an ecologist who has experienced translation. Communicating ecology through the media is a two-step process, from scientist to journalist to the public. By assembling two of the parties to this process, this symposium hopes to provide a practicum as well as an analysis of how to communicate ecology through the media. Tuesday, August 8, 2000 8:30 AM to Noon Symposium # 14 Ecology and Agriculture. Organized by D. Andow, S. Gliessman, N. Jordan, M. Liebman, D. Neher and A. Power. (Sponsored by the Prospective Agroecology Section.) Location: Ballroom 11 - Cliff Lodge Agriculture provides the central food resources for humans and is necessary for our continued existence. Yet ecology and agriculture are often perceived in opposition. For many ecologists, ecology champions the preservation of native ecosystems and ecological functions, while agriculture replaces them with monocultures and intensive external inputs. Consequently, most ecologists avoid investigation of significant issues in agriculture leaving the discussion of how to attain agricultural sustainability largely in the hands of agricultural scientists. The ESA has addressed agriculture in symposia and contributed paper sessions scattered during the past 15 years. The early events showed that agroecology could address some significant agricultural issues, but the primary result was to validate using agricultural materials to investigate significant ecological problems. The goal of the symposium "Ecology and Agriculture" is to probe the relation between ecology and agriculture in order to create a broader discussion within the ESA about the role of ecological investigation in agroecosystems. Specifically, we have asked the speakers to address this issue directly using their own interests to highlight significant questions for future ecological investigation. For example, we anticipate that some of the speakers will address how ecologists can make important contributions toward resolving pressing environmental, crop production, and crop protection problems associated with conventional production practices. Our specific objectives are to have speakers evaluate how agricultural issues can be addressed from various ecological perspectives, including ecosystem functioning, microbial and soil dynamics, insect-plant interaction and evolution, plant communities and biodiversity, theoretical ecology, and population biology. Tuesday, August 8, 2000 8:00 AM to 1 1:45 AM Symposium # 1 5: Measurement Error in Ecological Data. Organized by B.A. Maurer, M. Taper and H. Caswell. (Sponsored by the Statistical Ecology Section.) Location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff Lodge To acquire their data, ecologists qpically rely on measurement processes that are subject to a relatively large amount of uncertainty. This is particularly true of data collected at larger scales of resolution. At the largest scales, remotely sensed data contain many sources of error that can enter into ecologically relevant data such as estimates of vegetation density or habitat classifications. Error also enters into ecological research any time populations are censused. It is rarely possible to obtain an accurate and complete count of the number of individuals in a population, and many sources of measurement error potentially increase the uncertainty in estimates of population size, density, and demographic properties. Uncertainties can be compounded or propagated when inaccurate data are aggregated at larger scales to describe properties of large ecological units. Significant statistical problems arise when measurement error is not properly modeled in the process of data analysis. The purpose of this symposium is to gather together individuals who have had experience in estimating, modeling, and evaluating the effects of measurement 49</page><page sequence="50">in ecological data. The speakers will address a variety of problems that arise when measurement error contributes a significant component to the overall uncertainty of an ecological data set. A number of solutions will be discussed, including various statistical techniques that can be used to evaluate the role of measurement error in the data. The symposium will give practicing ecologists an introduction to statistical solutions to the problems encountered when there is a substantial amount of measurement error in a data set. Tuesday, August 8, 2000 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM Symposium # 16: Plant Physiological Ecology: Linking the Organism to Scales Above and Below. Organized by J.S. Coleman, T. E. Dawson and R.B. Jackson. (Sponsored by the Physiological Ecology Section.) Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge In 1987, a series of papers on plant physiological ecology were published in BioScience. These seminal papers set forth a set of themes that essentially defined the field and communicated some of the more important questions in need of further research in the decade to come. Since their publication these papers have also helped scientists, graduate students and funding agencies see where the field was headed or needed to head. Over the last 13 years, plant physiological ecology has gradually broadened and diversified beyond these central themes. Today the field is challenged with redefining its goals and future directions; the forthright and concise agenda it set forth in 1987 has evolved and needs to be revisited. This was made painfully clear to Coleman when he ran NSF s Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology program in 1996. Today, physiological ecologists still hold tightly to the idea that the "organism" remains the cornerstone for all of its investigations. Organisms define the boundary and ultimate product of molecular and cellular processes, the unit of selection, the key elements comprising populations and communities and its is organisms that drive or shape ecosystem functions. Not surprisingly, therefore, scaling-up from organismal level processes to populations, communities and ecosystems and scaling down to molecular and cellular phenomena as well as over evolutionary time seems to be what, today, best defines where the field is headed. "Snowbird 2000" is the perfect venue to take a retrospective and prospective look at plant physiological ecology. In our symposium, the ultimate goal is to clearly communicate a future vision of plant physiological ecology to students, scientists, funding agencies and the public. More specifically, this symposium will address the following questions: I) What path has the field taken to get where it is today, 2) How well did we answer the questions posed in the BioScience series, and 3) What is the path for the future? Our goal is that Snowbird will foster discussion that will culminate with a workshop in 2001, and ultimately a series of papers like those in BioScience that so clearly communicate a scientific agenda. Tuesday, August 8, 2000 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM Symposium # 17: Land Use and Land Cover Change: The Last Century and Prospects for the 2 I st Century. Organized by L. Johnson and P.A. Matson. Location: Ballroom 11 - Cliff Lodge In the last century, as much as 40% of the earth's land surface has been transformed by humans. This land use/land cover change continues at unprecedented rates as the human population continues to grow exponentially. These land cover changes in many cases fundamentally alter basic ecological processes such as biogeochemical cycles and availability of key limiting nutrients, trace gas fluxes, C sequestration, atmosphere-biosphere interactions, and biodiversity. These land transformations may perhaps irreversibly alter the ability of natural ecosystems to sustain an ever growing human population in the 21st century. The objective of this symposium is to bring together speakers with a variety of expertise ranging from remote sensing, biogeochemistry, community ecology, and socioeconomics to synthesize the present state of knowledge of rates and causes of land transformations in the US and globally, and to predict potential ecosystem consequences for the 21st century. Such an ESA symposium would make an excellent venue for bringing the highly interdisciplinary and newly emerging issues of land use and land cover change to the forefront of the ecological community. Tuesday, August 8, 2000 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM Symposium # I 8: The Role of Theoretical Ecology in Biodiversity Conservation and Management. Organized by M.C. Anderson. (Sponsored by the Theoretical Ecology Section.) location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff lodge Growing awareness of the looming biodiversity crisis has provided the impetus for the development of areas of ecological theory relevant to conservation problems. Questions addressed by this body of theory include the estimation of extinction rates, efficient allocation of conservation effort, integration of population models 50</page><page sequence="51">with data, and understanding the effects of habitat and landscape fragmentation. Development of these areas of theory holds the promise of increased synergism between theorists and empiricists in ecology. The topic of the proposed symposium, The role of theoretical ecology in biodiversity conservation and management, fits in well with the ESA meeting s theme of Advancing and Communicating Ecology. The symposium represents opportunities for advancement of ecology through the potential for developing linkages between theoretical and empirical research in ecology, and perhaps more importantly between basic and applied research in ecology. The symposium also exemplifies some of the most important challenges in communicating ecology, because of the continuing controversy over the important issue of biodiversity conservation. All of the proposed speakers have made important contributions to the integration of ecological theory and conservation practice. Some of these contributions are widely recognized, while others deserve to be more widely disseminated to the scientific community. This symposium will provide an opportunity to communicate advances in ecological theory in an area that is relevant to a large fraction of the ESA membership. Wednesday, August 9, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium # 19: Carnivorous Plants as Model Ecological Systems. Organized by A.M. Ellison &amp; N.J. Gotelli. Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge Although portrayed as simple curiosities of the plant kingdom ('toy plants'), we suggest that carnivorous plants (CPs) actually are ideal organisms with which to generate and test ecological theories. This symposium will illustrate how the unique combinations of traits that CPs possess can be used to test novel hypotheses about population biology and community organization. Because CPs are both autotrophic and heterotrophic, one fundamental question that CPs can be used to address is "why be a heterotroph?" CPs also possess suites of life-history traits that make them particularly amenable to demographic modeling and life-history analysis. At the population level, we can take advantage of the dual trophic nature of CPs to test general theories of resource competition using responses of CPs and non-CPs to soil fertility gradients, and to explore the evolution of pollination, deception, and resource parasitism. A central theory in plant community ecology is Grime's partitioning of plants along a three-way axis (C-S-R) related to disturbance, stress, and intensity of competition. This theory asserts that there is no life-history strategy for high-disturbance, low-productivity habitats, yet many CPs live in just such habitats. It is well-known that the inquiline communities of pitcher-plants (Sarracenia, Darlingtonia, Nepenthes) are model systems for studying trophic structure and community assembly across a broad range of environmental variables. It is less appreciated that CPs themselves may illustrate novel patterns of community structure and community assembly in habitats with dramatically different ecosystem properties (nutrient cycling and carbon dynamics). Finally, CPs are model systems for studying evolutionary convergence in response to similar ecological constraints. This symposium will highlight how a concerted focus on a unique group of plants can illuminate a wide range of open ecological and evolutionary questions. Wednesday, August 9, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #20: Global Change in Forests: Interactions Among Biodiversity, Climate and Land Use. Organized by A. Hansen and V. Dale. Location: Ballroom 11 - Cliff Lodge Understanding interactions among climate, land use, and biodiversity is important for predicting and coping with global change. Climate and land use both drive biodiversity. The responses of biodiversity both influence human society and feedback to influence climate and land use. Coping with global change will require manipulation of biodiversity to mitigate negative outcomes. We are examining these issues within the biodiversity committee of the Forest Sector of the National Assessment. The project involves both synthesis of current knowledge and new assessments of the response of biodiversity to future global change. The results are targeted for publication in BioScience and Ecosystems. The objectives of this symposium are to: 1) Summarize the objectives, approach, and current findings of the National Assessment, 2) Synthesize current knowledge on interactions among climate, land use, and biodiversity, 3) Present state-of-the-science assessments of biodiversity resonse to future climate change, and 4) Outline key implications for future research and for coping with global change. This symposium is of importance and interest to ESA Members in that it is designed to lay the foundation for advances that will shape research and management on aspects of global change in the next century. One advance involves the integration of climate change and land use in management on aspects of global change in the next century. One advance involves the integration of climate change and land use in studies of global change. These two prongs of global change have been largely studied in isolation. This symposium will explain why these factors need be linked and approaches for achieving this integration. Another 51</page><page sequence="52">advance involves more direct consideration of biodiversity in global change research, with reference to how biodiversity mediates ecosystem response to global change and how biodiversity feeds back to influence climate and land use. We hope that attendees leave the symposium with several new ideas for research questions and management approaches for understanding and coping with global change. Wednesday, August 9, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #2 1: The Rhizosphere: Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches. Organized by Z.G. Cardon and J.Whitbeck. (Sponsored by the Soil Ecology Section.) Location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff Lodge Study of the ecology of the rhizosphere is, by necessity, interdisciplinary. The rhizosphere is most often defined as the volume of soil most heavily influenced by the root, and thus the study of the rhizosphere depends on understanding plant biology, soil physical and chemical properties and their interactions with roots, and soil community structure, dynamics, and function. Summary volumes from the early 90's (e.g. Lynch, 1990, and Box Jr. and Hammond, 1990) reflect this interdisciplinary nature, with contributions focusing on root form and function, carbon allocation belowground, microbial-faunal interactions, cropping systems, rhizosphere processes, root disease, and soil structure. Furthermore, these volumes emphasize that not only is rhizosphere research academically interdisciplinary, but also it has wide applied value for natural and agricultural system management alike. We propose a symposium focusing on recent developments in rhizosphere research. New experimental techniques for analyzing key rhizosphere processes will be presented, along with new views of the links between rhizodeposition under elevated CO72 and soil organic matter dynamics, and novel connections between soil food webs, soils management, NPP, and biodiversity. Our immediate objective is to bring together experts from three general backgrounds (plant biology, soil physics and chemistry, and soil community ecology) to foster a stimulating symposial conversation of interest to plant, soil, microbial, mesofaunal, and global change ecologists. Such a conversation between disciplines specifically supports ESA theme "Advancing and Communicating Ecology" by fostering communication among rhizosphere researchers of varied background. Moreover, such a rhizosphere symposium should draw an audience of scientists with a broad range of basic and applied research interests and, we hope, stimulate further collaboration between soil, plant, and ecosystem ecologists beyond the rhizosphere. Wednesday, August 9, 2000 1:00 PM to 4: 10 PM Symposium #22: Species Diversity at Broad Scales: Linking Science and Management. Organized by K.D. Brosofske Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge Managers are increasingly expected to manage public lands for sustainability of non-economic values, such as biological diversity, as well as for economic outputs, such as timber. To do this, land managers must consider how their actions influence these values using current scientific research. Although it is easy to stipulate that forest management plans must maintain or enhance biological diversity, how this is to be accomplished is less obvious. Traditional stand-level management is becoming outmoded, rendering the collection of current management tools incomplete. With greater emphasis on managing landscapes and ecosystems, new methods for translating information to broader scales and for using this information are needed as we move into the 21st century. The goal of this symposium is to provide a forum for forest scientists and managers to present issues relevant to the mutual exchange of knowledge and technologies concerning species diversity at broad scales. In the context of current public sentiment regarding biological diversity as well as changing scales of emphasis, it is now more important than ever that scientists and managers effectively communicate with each other their information needs and research results. The symposium will focus on relationships between forest management and diversity at broad scales, highlighting specific projects and tools that have successfully bridged the gap between scientists and decision-makers. Speakers represent national, state, private, and research viewpoints, presenting both general talks and case studies, including some good examples of ongoing projects that directly link science and management. Wednesday, August 9, 2000 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM Symposium #23: Why Variation is Not Just Noise: The Influence of Variability on Plant-Herbivore and Plant-Pathogen Inter actions. Organized by C. Orians. Location: Ballroom II - Cliff Lodge In 1983, the influential book Variable Plants and Herbivores in Natural and Managed Systems introduced a new conceptual focus to the field of plant-herbivore interactions. The chapters in this book identified many sources of variation in plant-herbivore systems and, more importantly, suggested that variability itself 52</page><page sequence="53">might have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. In the 17 years since this book was published, an impressive body of research has addressed variation in plant-herbivore systems, with a particular wealth of work on herbivore responses to host-plant quality, induced plant resistance, and herbivore responses to plant diversity. Despite this important work relating to variation, relatively few studies have directly confronted the consequences of variation per se. Given the new data now available and the increasing use of mathematical theory as a tool in plant-insect studies, we feel that the time is ripe to re examine this issue. We are now in a position to both evaluate how far we have come, and to highlight how variability can be the focus of conceptually exciting work in plant-insect interactions in the next decade. We propose a symposium to address how levels of within and among plant variability affect the ecology and evolution of plants and their herbivores and pathogens. Rather than cataloging sources of variation, we focus specifically on differences between systems with more or less variation. This symposium will highlight the impact of variability as an important new direction for research in plant-herbivore/pathogen interactions, and for ecology in general. We have chosen speakers who will address a broad range of topics in this area, representative of the variety of approaches currently used in plant-herbivore studies. The proposed talks will include ecological and evolutionary studies of both herbivores and pathogens, and applied and basic research using both theory and experiments. Wednesday, August 9, 2000 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM Symposium #24: Re-thinking the "and" in Humans and Nature: Ecology at the Boundary of Human Systems. Organized by G. A. Bradshaw Location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff Lodge The traditional division of human and natural sciences reflects a long held belief that human systems, their behaviours and interactions, differ dramatically from ecosystems. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, the relationship between humans and nature has become the foremost driver of ecological research and the science of ecology is now thematically and functionally embedded in the "human dimension". With the explicit consideration of humans in the ecological equation, the traditional boundary between nature and humans, which once delineated natural from social sciences, has become a critical edge. This edge is the site of conceptual and operational factors that lends structure to science and society while erecting barriers to resolving critical socio-environmental issues. Resolving these issues requires understanding how humans perceive and interact with nature, and how these perceptions give rise to the boundaries between science, society, and nature. Perceptions of the nature-human relationship frame scientific questions and determine how knowledge is created and used. Science, like all knowledge systems, develops within a specific set of historical dynamics; modern ecology in turn reflects its cultural origins with attendant models and myths. The emergence of alternative views (e.g., complex adaptive systems, indigenous knowledge, ecopsychology) suggests a re-structuring of the nature-human dichotomy and raises several important questions: How will this affect the conceptual foundations of ecology? What does it mean conceptually, pragmatically, and operationally to incorporate humans into the study of ecosystems? Does a new conceptual framework need to be developed which integrates social and natural sciences? We present discussions and perspectives on these topics resulting from an NCEAS workshop. Thursday, August 10, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #25. Cows and Conservation: A Role for Ranching in Protecting Biodiversity. Organized by L. Hidinger, B. Budd, R. Dueser, C.H. Sieg and N. West. (Sponsored by the Western Chapter and Rangeland Section, The Nature Conservancy, Society for Range Management, National Cattleman's Beef Association and NRCS Wildlife Management Habitat Institute.) Location: Ballroom I - Cliff Lodge Despite the historical animosity between ranchers and conservationists, these two groups do share some objectives (clean water, flourishing wildlife, and healthy ecosystems). Out of these joint concerns, private, public, and non-profit collaborations are being formed. A notable example is the Malpai Borderlands Group, a collaboration of ranchers, environmental groups, government agencies, and university scientists with a commitment to restore and maintain the natural processes that create and protect a healthy, unfragmented landscape to support a diverse, flourishing community of human, plant, and animal life. Conservation-minded ranches, such as The Nature Conservancy s Red Canyon Ranch in Wyoming, can provide examples of how saving biological diversity goes hand-in-hand with a financially viable business venture. They can also serve as research sites for scientists, classrooms for students, and neutral meeting places for ranchers, community members, recreationists and conservationists. Conservation and ranching can be a tremendous combination, as ranching may be one of the best alternatives for protecting threatened open space and areas of high biological diversity already being ranched. Ranchers are changing their operations and management techniques to include ecological processes and protect environmental values. Some of these changes include more fences (fencing off riparian areas to provide habitat for neotropical birds and/or to exclude cattle from stream banks), water troughs to divert cattle from streams, rotational grazing systems that change the timing 53</page><page sequence="54">and duration of grazing, dam removal to restore natural water flow, noxious weed mitigation, and native plant reintroduction. Ranchers are also collaborating with scientists to advance the understanding of grassland and riparian ecosystems, the impacts of grazing, and the conservation of biodiversity. Thursday, August 10, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #26: Conservation of Ecologically Important Variation: Comparing Molecular Markers and Ecological Traits. Organized by J.K. McKay and Kj. Rice. Location: Ballroom 11 - Cliff Lodge Impacts of human activity and future climate change make estimating ecologically important (non-neutral) genetic variation crucial to accurately assess the ability of species and populations to persist in the face of spatial and temporal environmental variation. Often in conservation levels of neutral or nearly neutral genetic variation are estimated using random genetic markers. Neutral genetic markers infer the present and historical population structure of taxa of concern. However, to maintain evolutionary potential we need to preserve genetic variation in ecologically important (non-neutral) traits. In particular we must preserve genetic variation in traits involved in local adaptation, such as behavioral, morphological and physiological traits, which will allow species to survive across habitats, both present and future. Testing for the presence of local adaptation is critical in conservation, e.g. stocking, translocation and restoration, however this is not possible using only molecular data. This symposium will examine the current state of understanding of the relationship between neutral and adaptive variation in natural populations, and emphasize the importance of considering ecological genetics in conservation. Content of the talks will seek a balance between theory and application, in order to communicate the need for new approaches in conservation. Given the accelerated rate in the loss of biodiversity, we need to critically evaluate current approaches to assessing evolutionary potential. Thursday, August 10, 2000 8:00 AM to Noon Symposium #27: Advancing the Individual-Based Modeling Approach: New Tools and Concepts. Organized by S. Railsback, J. Anderson and R. Lamberson. Location: Ballroom Ill - Cliff Lodge Individual-based models (IBMs) have great potential for both advancing and communicating ecology. IBMs are among the few tools ecologists have for studying and demonstrating natural complexities. We will make the following points: I) Despite their promise, IBMs have made little contribution to basic or applied ecology, 2) One root cause of IBMs failure to advance ecology is their lack of an established conceptual foundation. Modelers are unaware of key conceptual flaws in their models. For example, the practice of forcing model individuals to reproduce behaviors observed in real populations is dangerous when the model is applied to previously unobserved situations. Failing to let individuals make decisions predictively makes realistic behavior unlikely. We lack even a list of IBM design considerations, 3) A second root cause has been the lack of appropriate software tools. Because IBMs use individual behavior to predict population responses, IBM software must allow individual behaviors to be observed; otherwise, the model is essentially untestable and unlikely to advance the science, 4) New software tools for individual based simulations help eliminate the software concerns. Technologies like animation and probes allow individual behaviors to be observed, making models much easier test and improve, communicate, and believe, 5) The new field of Complex Adaptive Systems appears useful as a conceptual foundation for IBMs. Thinking about such issues as emergent vs. imposed behaviors, what kind of adaptation is appropriate, how individuals predict decision outcomes, and how fitness is evaluated can help modelers identify and address the subtle but important formulation decisions that determine model success, 6) Giving individuals simple fitness-maximizing decisions rules, and the information about their environment necessary to predict decision outcomes, can cause many realistic behaviors to emerge naturally from an IBM. This result makes us hopeful that IBMs can meet their promise for advancing ecology as a predictive science. 54</page><page sequence="55">SCHEDULE OF SESSIONS *Designates Presenter SUNDAY, AUGUST 6, 2000 Symposium # I: Education and Human Resources Vice President's Symposium: Defining Ecological Thinking as a Goal for Ecology Education.

As with past All Scientists Meetings, the emphasis will be on the continued development of multi-disciplinary, cross-site collaborations. The theme of this year's meeting is "Long-Term Ecological Research: Unifying Principles and Global Applications". In addition to a keynote address by Dr. Rosina Bierbaum of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the program includes six plenary lectures by invited speakers, over 60 workshops, poster sessions, student seminars, the debut of a video on the International LTER pro gram, and the first LTER Town Meeting. The structure of the All Scientists Meeting is designed to provide time for participants to follow up on new results and ideas pre sented in plenaries and workshops. To that end, time is set aside each day for ad hoc meetings of scientists interested in pursuing new initiatives. Many topics covered during the meeting will be continuations of core LTER research areas. Other topics will be discussed for the first time at an All Scientists Meeting (e.g., incor porating social science into LTER research, integrating educa tional initiatives into the LTER Network). As customary, infor mation management and data sharing will be an important theme of the meeting. Past All Scientists Meetings have had an energiz ing effect on the scientists of the LTER Network and have led to important syntheses of concepts. By coordinating the All Scientists Meeting with the annual meet ing of ESA, the LTER Network hopes to provide opportunities for greater collaboration with other ecological networks and scientists. We encourage scientists planning on attending the ESA meeting to come early to attend the All Scientists Meeting. A final schedule of events and workshops will be handed out at the meeting.
