<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Paulme-Lifchitz Collection at the Mus6e de l'Homme DENISE PAULME My first trip to Africa occurred in 1935, when I stayed among the Do- gon, who at that time were known only to a small group of specialists. I had been studying with the anthropologist Marcel Mauss (who taught a general course at the Institut d'Ethnologie, and a more specialized one at both the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and at the College de France, Universite de Paris) and working at the Musee d'Ethnog- raphie du Trocaddro, first as a volunteer and then for a modest salary. I was also finishing up a law degree. The mu- seum's deputy director, Georges-Henri Riviere, had acquired an important group of objects from Western and Equatorial Africa that had been shown at the Colonial Exhibition at Vincennes dur- ing the summer of 1931, among the most notable of which were the fiber skirts and masks of the Dogon dancers who had been brought to Paris for that occa- sion. In what was to be my first contact with the Dogon, I registered the collec- tion. Then, typing a fair number of cards and labels, I participated in the prepara- tion of the exhibition that followed the return, after two years, of the "Mission Dakar-Djibouti" led by Marcel Griaule. This memorable show marked the inau- guration of the renovated museum, now the Musee de l'Homme, in 1934. I was not even dreaming of the possi- bility of a trip to the field when the op- portunity of a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship presented itself. I had only just finished my law degree. With the support of Mauss and Paul Rivet, direc- tor of the Musee d'Ethnographie du Trocaddro, and the blessing of Levy- Bruhl, President of the Institut d'Ethnologie, my candidacy was se- cured, and it was agreed that I would go to Africa for the time required to gather the material for my doctoral thesis. I shared the fellowship with Deborah Lif- chitz, a linguist. She had already been to Ethiopia, having joined the Mission Dakar-Djibouti, and she possessed the practical experience and authority that I totally lacked. My choice (though I do not even re- member choosing - so many things seemed to happen by themselves) was the Dogon, to whom Griaule had de- cided to return briefly to complete his observations on masks and to make a film. We accompanied this expedition, which was baptized "Sahara-Soudan." Thus, one night after an unforgettable trip across the Sahara in two Renault trucks in January 1935 (I have never been so cold at night), we found ourselves at the end of the road that leads from Ban- diagara to Sanga (see my 1977 article, "Sanga 1935," Cahiers d'Etudes Africaines, vol. 17, no. 65, pp. 7-12). Griaule and his team were to stay for six weeks. The group included two tech- nicians, Marcel Larget and Eric Lutten, and ethnomusicologist Andre Schaeff- ner, who had all been part of the preced- ing mission. Filmmaker Roger Mourlan, 1.

After their departure Deborah and I were to remain as long as possible - until our money ran out, which would not be until the end of October. The first few weeks were difficult. In addition to the filming, for which a performance of masked dancing was commissioned, the presence of so many Europeans all wanting to work quickly upset the life of the village. Aside from a few riddles, the information that I struggled to collect among children, who fled at the slightest pretext, was without interest. I seriously doubted my abilities. Only when our companions left did life return to normal; only then were we able to organize our work. Deborah devoted herself to studying the language. As for me, I could not afford to overlook any- thing, since I did not think I would be able to return anytime soon. One's first fieldwork is always a leap into the un- known, a true test. The teaching I had received was theoretical; I had to invent my own method of working and could count only on myself. I had brought just one book (in addition to the Bible) - Notes and Queries on Anthropology, pub- lished by the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland - and I would read it and reread it. We had not intended to acquire objects for the museum, since the collection of masks that Griaule had made during his two stays seemed to us to have exhausted Dogon sculpture. How could we have foreseen the pillaging that was later to occur? In addition, no provisions to that effect had been made in my fel- lowship. However, during the course of research, professional conscience led me to buy objects of current usage - a belt, a comb, a twin's necklace or bonnet, a hair pin, a stirrer used to prepare rice, a pot- ter's mat made of baobab bark, and a calendar made from a simple piece of wood with thirteen notches. (It was sus- pended under the men's meeting house, and the oldest man moved a cord down a notch each month.) During the course of our wanderings through villages on foot or on horseback, we could not help but notice the carved granary shutters and locks with anthropomorphic motifs that were present in almost every household. One day I could resist no longer, and I asked to acquire a door lock representing two ancestors. I offered three francs, tell- ing the owner that it could easily be re- placed with a European padlock like the ones found in the market, and which were certainly far more prestigious in everyone's eyes. My proposition was greeted with much enthusiasm: our usual informants received five francs a day and were the envy of all. From that day on, I was seized with the collecting demon. After all, I was as- sociated with a museum whose interests were close to my heart. In the end, the collection Deborah and I brought back comprised 184 objects: 96 shutters and locks, 45 figures, and a few masks and musical instruments, including drums and whistles. Naturally, except for the locks and shutters, many of these items were not collected exactly in their place of use. As soon as word got out that we were in a village, the statues would pour in, brought in secret in sacks or packages that were opened with care in front of us. These objects, we knew, were the re- mains of cults that had disappeared, the user having died and the statues aban- doned. Nonetheless I always asked for the name of the village and paid what was considered an honest price (30-50 francs). We never wentabove 5 francs for the locks. When we left many still re- mained in place. We also found, aban- doned in granaries, the first sculptures now said to date from the Tellem civiliza- tion. The cult with which they were as- sociated had died with those who had celebrated it. The find of which I remain the most proud is the tree trunk from Yaya village, measuring 1.4 meters high and carved in the image of a man, which has been pub- lished often (Fig. 8). I had spotted it from the top of a terrace. The head, which was all that was visible, was being used as a post for hitching horses. When I asked that the whole thing be dug up, the villa- gers refused to touch it: "That is not our business; those things were already there when our ancestors arrived." This was all that the people could tell us about the statue. However, they did not pre- vent my friend and me from digging it out with only our pocketknives. Nearby we unearthed other objects of the same type, but from which all carving had dis- appeared. I do not recall how we man- aged to pull out the whole sculpture or how we solved the problem of its trans- port, since no one wanted to touch it. But I have not forgotten our emotion at the sight of what proved to be a masterpiece. In the final accounting, considering these objects, my thesis, and Deborah's and my articles, the 50,000 francs of our fellowship were not too badly spent. - 6.
