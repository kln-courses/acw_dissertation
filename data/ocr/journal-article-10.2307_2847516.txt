<plain_text><page sequence="1">EUHEMERISM: A MEDIAEVAL INTERPRETATION OF CLASSICAL PAGANISM BY JOHN DANIEL COOKE INTEREST in the subject of classical paganism was fostered in the minds of the people of the Middle Ages through the realiza- tion that while in most respects the ancient Greeks and Romans had been superior to themselves, they had been in error regarding their religious beliefs. An examination of the principal writings in Middle English, with considerable reading of literature other than English, discloses the fact that the people of the Middle Ages rarely regarded the so-called gods as mere figments of the imagination, but rather believed that they were or had been real beings, sometimes possessing actual power. Probably the most generally accepted inter- pretation was to regard them as only mortal men who had, through the respect of their descendants, become falsely worshipped as gods. This interpretation, known as euhemerism, explains only the origin of the gods. To explain how mortal men could continue to be thus worshipped, it was thought: (1) that mankind had been deceived by poets and myth-makers who had fabricated the stories of their deifi- cation and potency; or (2) that the so-called gods had come to pos- sess or exert actual power (a) through the intervention of demons and satanic influence, or (b) through the identity or alignment of the pagan gods with the planets of the same name which, at least in the later Middle Ages, were thought to possess actual power. Each of these supplementary interpretations may appear independently as an explanation of classical paganism. The purpose of the present study is to trace only the development of euhemerism.1 1 The importance of euhemerism as a mediaeval explanation of classical paganism is attested by the number of passages here collected that support this theory. Little interest has been expressed in the subject heretofore. Since its influence, as an atheistic interpretation of the gods, was not great among the ancients themselves, writers on Greek and Roman religion are relieved of the necessity of doing more than mention it. Cf. W. Warde Fowler, Roman Ideas of Deity (London: Macmillan, 1914), p. 100. Its influence upon ancient thought is treated briefly by A. B. Drachmann in Atheism in Pagan Antiquity (London: Gyldendal, 1922).

Ennius 1 translated his work into Latin, but both original and translation are lost except for quotations, for the most part in Lactantius. Classical writers, notably Cicero 2 and Plutarch,3 referred to the euhemeristic interpretation, but denied and con- demned it as impious and absurd. Quite different is the attitude taken toward euhemerism by the early fathers. Hostile to the pagan religion, they seize eagerly upon the euhemeristic interpretation and direct it against their pagan antagonists. Why will the pagans worship gods who were only men? In order to realize the full significance of the patristic interpretation, account must be taken of three additional contributing factors or modes of interpretation: (1) the explanation of the origin of idolatry as presented in the Book of Wisdom; (2) the ascription of human sin and frailty to the gods, especially by the poets; (3) and the orthodox pagan interpretation of the deification of such gods as Hercules, Castor and Pollux, and Romulus. As an Hebraic background for their euhemeristic interpretation, the fathers were familiar with a passage in the Book of Wisdom 4 which explained some ways in which idolatry originated. Idolatry was instituted either: (1) when a grief-stricken father caused a statue to be made of a child which had been snatched away by death, and then compelled his household to worship the image; or (2) when a 113-147, and Osgood, Classical Mythology in Milton (New York, 1900), p. xlvii, mention the theory as a common mediaeval and sixteenth-seventeenth century interpretation of classical paganism. For the interpretation that Euhemerus was really satirizing the pretensions of Alexander the Great, cf. 0. Gruppe, Griechische Mythologie und Religionsgeschichte (Munich, 1906), p. 1515. 1 Q. Ennius, Carminum Reliquiae, ed. L. Muller; St Petersburg: C. Ricker, 1884. 2 De Natura Deorum, ed. C. F. W. Muller (Teubner, 1910), i, 42. Cicero rejects the euhe- meristic interpretation but subscribes, at least tentatively, to the orthodox pagan belief in the deification of such heroes as Hercules, Castor and Pollux, Aesculapius, Liber, and Romu- lus, "who were exalted to heaven by fame and universal consent because they were distin- guished by their excellent benefits to the public" (Ibid., ii, 24). 3 De Iside et Osiride, Cap. 23, in Scripta Moralia, ed. F. Diibner (Paris, 1885), p. 440. 4 Liber Sapientiae, xiv, 15-21.</page><page sequence="3">398 Euhemerism people set up a likeness of their absent king and by degrees began to worship the statue with religious rites. Echoes of the passage are to be found in many of the fathers; the first definite reference to it seems to be in the Speculum Morale (iii, 3, 27), formerly attributed to Vincent of Beauvais. Considerable influence toward a euhemeristic interpretation was exerted upon the fathers by the stories which the pagan poets had feigned of the human frailty and sinfulness of the gods.1 Making use of these traditional representations, the fathers were able to make more vivid delineations of the gods conceived of as mere men. Justin Martyr (103-167), in his Oratio ad Graecos and Cohortatio ad Graecos,2 objects to the pagan gods because of their sinfulness which he describes in glowing colors, but does not clearly subscribe to the theory that they had been only men. It is impossible to say exactly what his conception of them was; it is important to remember that in the second century the question with the churchmen was not so much whether a thing was true or false as whether it was good or bad. Finally, in the orthodox pagan belief that certain of the gods, such as Hercules, Castor and Pollux, and Aesculapius were deified men, the fathers found material which by a slight alteration they were able to turn to account. They gladly accepted the pagan belief that these gods had been originally only men; but, whereas the pagans were wont to say that they had been transformed into real deities, the fathers said that they had simply remained men - dead men- and that the worship had been falsely bestowed upon them. Very l Xenophanes of Colophon, Plato, and others of the pagans had, of course, long objected to the traditional accounts of the lust and crimes attributed to the gods by the ancient poets. Franz Cumont, in Les Religions Orientales dans le Paganisme Romain (Paris, 1906), pp. 244, 245, believes that the fathers failed to realize, or acknowledge, the process of evolution by which the worn-out and dead elements of the old religion had been cast aside and supplanted by new stock from foreign sources. Thus Augustine sneers jestingly at the number of Italian gods who preside over the most insignificant acts of existence. It was easier, Cumont con- cludes, to reproduce the objections of the Epicureans and Sceptics against beliefs that had been abolished than to study, for their criticism, the faults of an organism still functioning. The Christian polemic was hardly fair, "Lorsqu'elle insiste avec complaisance sur l'immor- alite des legendes sacrees, elle ne laisse pas soup;onner que les dieux et les heros de la mytho- logie n'avaient plus qu'une existence purement litteraire." 2 Pat. Graeca VI, cols. 231 ff. and 274 if., respectively.</page><page sequence="4">Euhemerism 399 soon they applied the theory not only to the gods whom the ancients had regarded as deified men, but to all of the pagan gods. Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Minucius Felix, and Lactantius find an approach through this belief to their theory that all of the pagan gods had been only men who were later regarded as gods. Writers later than these seldom distinguished between the two classes - all had formerly been men. Clement of Alexandria (115-217), after rehearsing the wicked deeds of the gods and noting that Hercules and Castor and Pollux were only men, says that the objects of the pagans' worship were only men who in due time died and came to be worshipped through myth and the passage of time-the earliest occurrence I have found of the statement that "the gods whom you (the pagans) worship were one time men": ot WpOOKVVOv4EVOl 7rcap' l4tv avOpcoprot yevo,levot 7rore . . . This statement is quoted again and again by later writers. Continu- ing, Clement says that it is in this way that the dead of antiquity, being revered through the long prevalence of delusion respecting them, are regarded as gods by posterity. In illustration he refers to the fables of the poets, and cites Euhemerus as a man of clearer insight than the rest. Tertullian (145-220), after directing attention to the Roman heroes who are regarded as gods, asserts that according to the ancient historians all the pagan gods were originally only human beings, in many cases, of questionable character.2 He challenges the pagans to find in their ancient writers, such as Diodorus Siculus, Thallus, Cassius, Severus, Cornelius Nepos, or anyone else, statements to the contrary. To prove the absurdity of the argument that the gods were really deified after death, he calls attention to the fact that the things over which the gods have command had existed from the very first; consequently the gods were not creators, but simply the 1 Cohortatio ad Gentes (Pat. Graeca VIII, col. 152), iv, 55. 2 Ad Nationes (Pat. Lat. I, cols. 603-608) ii, 13-17, and Apologeticus Adv. Gentes (Pat. Lat. I, cols. 327-339), X-X1I.</page><page sequence="5">400 Euhemerism discoverers of these things; therefore, there is no reason to deify the discoverers of some things without deifying the discoverers of all things. Or, if it is considered that deification is a sort of reward of merit, why not deify Socrates for his wisdom, Aristides for justice, Themistocles for his warlike genius, Alexander for his sublimity of soul, Polycrates for his good fortune, Croesus for his wealth, and Demosthenes for his eloquence? After comparing these notable Greeks with Romans of similar merit, Tertullian points out that the supreme god was too much in a hurry to choose his associates; he should have waited longer in order to get the best. Tertullian finally closes by saying that he " sees only the names of dead men of ancient times; hears fabulous stories; recognizes sacred rites founded on mere myths." Toward the formulation of the patristic interpretation, Minucius Felix (flor. ca. 210) 1 contributes little; yet he utilizes the arguments of his predecessors. Eusebius (60-340) explains the human origin of the Babylonian god Baal; in his account of the Assyrians in his Chronicle2 he quotes from a number of writers; one chapter is based upon the history of Castor, who says that Belus was the first king of the Assyrians, that he lived at the time of the war between the Giants and Titans, and that after his death he was regarded as a god. The story illustrates the second way in which, according to the Boolk of Wisdom, idolatry might originate, and was frequently used by writers on classical mythology. The father who most convincingly presents the case for euhemerism is Lactantius (60-330) in his Diuinae Institutiones.3 He quotes what Euhemerus had to say about the origin and mortal relationships of the gods. Appreciating more fully than had the other fathers the passage in the Boolk of Wisdom, he explains how, in a primitive society, the people were led to exalt the king and his whole family, either on account of his excellence, or in flattery, or because of the benefits by which they became civilized. After the decease of their king, they formed images so that they might derive consolation 1 Octavius (Pat. Lat. III, cols. 299-305), xx, 67 ff. 2 Chronicon (Pat.

VI, col. 190 ff.), i, 14 ff.</page><page sequence="6">Euhemerism 401 from the likeness; then continuing further, through love of his merits, they worshipped the memory of the dead so that they might seem to show their gratitude and might attract succeeding kings to the desire of ruling well. Lactantius thereupon finds in Cicero evidence, not only that he had regarded some of the gods as deified men,1- those usually so regarded by the pagans,- but that, in his Tusculani Disputationes,2 he implies that all of the gods had been translated from earth to heaven. Noting that heaven was almost filled with the human race, Cicero says that if one should attempt to examine the ancient ac- counts, he would find that even the gods of the higher class had gone from us into heaven. Continuing, he asks that Atticus recall whose sepulchres are pointed out in Greece; remember, since he has been initiated, what things were transmitted in the mysteries; then will he understand, what Cicero was afraid to confess openly, that even Apollo, Jove, Neptune, Vulcan, Mars, and Mercury were only deified men. Lactantius, of course, refuses to conceive of them as truly deified; they had been only euhemerized. To be more concrete, Lactantius names the men who are worshipped as gods in various places because of being the founders of those nations, or distinguished in some way. The Egyptians worship Isis; the Moors, Juba; the Macedonians, Cabirus; the Carthaginians, Uranus; the Latins, Faunus; the Sabines, Sancus; the Romans, Quirinus. Similarly Athens worships Minerva; Samos, Juno; Paphos, Venus; Lemnos, Vulcan; Naxos, Liber; and Delphos, Apollo. In presenting this list of divinities, Lactantius has drawn from a number of sources which the editor of the Migne edition has identified as far as possible. The more common are Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Livy, Varro, Plutarch, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Tertullian, and Minucius Felix. After the masterful treatises of Tertullian, Minucius Felix, and Lactantius, little remained for Augustine and others to develop in the doctrine of euhemerism. Augustine subscribes to the theory, however, both in his Epistolae and in De Ciuitate Dei.3 In the latter, I De Natura Deorum, i, 42; cf. also De Legibus, ii, 8. 2 Tusculani Disputationes, i, 12,13. 3 Epistola xvii, ad Maximum Madaurensem (Pat. Lat. XXXIII, cols. 83 ff.); De Ciuitate Dei (Pat. Lat. XLI), vii, 18, and viii, 26 ff.</page><page sequence="7">402 Euhemerism after discussing Varro's interpretation of the gods, he recalls that Varro had himself said that his opinions were ambiguous, and sug- gests that a far more creditable explanation is that the gods had been men, to each of whom sacred rites were instituted according to his genius, manners, actions, and circumstances. For illustration, Au- gustine mentions in the same chapter Aesculapius and Mercury. For the most part his authority was Cicero, since what he says does not recall any of the earlier Christian apologists and in two places he makes use, in passing, of Cicero's authority regarding the gods who were said to be deified and whom Augustine interpreted as simply euhemerized. Fulgentius, in his Mythologiae,1 presents an illustration of the first way that idolatry might originate according to the Book of Wisdom, but does not refer to the passage. Syrophanes in sorrow over the death of his son, causes a likeness of him to be made and set up in the market place. The subjects of the king, in order to please him, fall into the error of worshipping the statue. Isidore of Seville (575-638) summarizes and expresses in succinct form what has been developed by his predecessors. He begins with the assertion: Quos pagani deos asserunt, homines olim fuisse pro- duntur,2 which recalls the statement of Clement of Alexandria dis- cussed above (p. 399). He explains how people had been led to regard as gods the founders and kings of their cities, and in illustra- tion gives a list of men thus worshipped. Others of the so-called gods had been men who had become revered as the discoverers or inventors of an art-as Aesculapius of medicine-or for their pro- fessions or duties: ab actibus autem, ut Mercurius quod mercibus praeest.3 After naming Prometheus as the first to make statues of any kind, Isidore refers to Bel, the Babylonian idol, and tells us that Belus was the father of Ninus and the first king of the Assyrians. He apparently regards Bel as the first statue to be 1 MIitologiae, in Opera, ed. Rudolf Helm (Leipzig: Teubner, 1898), i, 1. 2 Etymologiae (Pat. Lat. LXXXII, col. 375), viii, ll. 3 Isidore probably had in mind a statement in the Commentary of Servius to Virgil's Aeneid (IV, 638): Et sciendum, Stoicos dicere unum esse deum, cui nomina variantur pro actibus et officiis ... Ab actibus autem vocantur; ut Juppiter, iuvans pater; Mercurius, quod mercibus praeest; Liber pater, a libertate (Commentarii in Virgilium Seruiani, ed. H. A. Lion, Got- tingen, 1826, p. 307).</page><page sequence="8">Euhemerism 403 worshipped, and probably derived his information from Eusebius (see p. 400). In closing his discussion, Isidore presents descriptions of some of the pagan gods, Oriental as well as Greek and Roman - all conceived as having been originally men and women. After the beginning of the seventh century, with the decline of interest in the ancient world, fewer writers discuss the subject of classical paganism. Of the Mediaeval Latin and Middle-English au- thors who subscribe to euhemerism, many are indebted to Isidore for their information. Those not indebted to him show the influence of various other writers, or simply make casual use of the interpretation. In order to indicate more clearly how the interpretation, developed by the fathers and transmittedf through Isidore, maintained an active existence down to the close of the Middle-English period, I shall first treat the works of authors indebted chiefly to Isidore. In the treatment of Isidore there are three statements of import- ance to the future development of euhemerism: (1) the general ex- planation of how it happened that notable men had come to be wor- shipped as gods by the pagans, with a list of those so honored in various places; (2) a brief statement regarding the origin of the idol Baal or Bel; and (3) the description of the principal pagan gods con- ceived of as mortals. Since not all writers make use of all three parts, and since two of them undergo further development, I shall treat the influence of each separately, taking them up in inverse order. The authors who follow Isidore in his descriptions of the gods are John of Damascus (I assume that he is the author of the Yita Bar- laam et Josaphat), Vincent of Beauvais, Guido delle Colonne, the author of Gest Hystoriale, Gower, and Lydgate. John of Damascus, in the eighth-century Vita Barlaam et Josaphat,l shows the influence of Isidore in his selection of Greek gods as well as in the descriptions of them. He has gleaned additional information from Ovid and else- where. Vincent of Beauvais,2 about the middle of the thirteenth century, and John Gower 3 (1390-1393) are indebted to both Isidore and John of Damascus. Guido 4 (1287) and, through him, the author 1 Pat.

William Caxton, in his translation (1471) of Raoul Lefevre's Recueil des Histoires de Troye, follows Guido's Historia in the third book of the Recuyell which treats of the fall of Troy proper. At the point corresponding to the digression in the Historia - the digression which deals at length with classical paganism - Caxton pauses to observe that here the author (Guido) declares from whence the worship of false gods had come.3 He does not, however, give the descriptions of the pagan gods, probably because in the first two books he had presented the mythological history of the gods conceived of as men and women. In the beginning of the first book, Uranus and Vesta (Vesca) are revealed to us as living happily and prosperously together, sur- rounded by their four children, Titan, Saturn, Sibele, and Ceres. Throughout the first and second books Caxton continues his ac- count as a family history of ordinary mortals. Regarding the origin of the Babylonian idol Baal or Bel, Isidore said that Belus was the father of Ninus and the first king of the Assyrians. Peter Comestor (ca. 1170), recalling the second expla- nation of the origin of idolatry according to the Book of Wisdom (see p. 397 above), fashioned the story of the beginning of idolatry that was generally followed by his successors: Mortuo Belo, Ninus in solatium doloris, imaginem patris sibi fecit, cui tantam exhibebat reuerentiam, ut quibuslibet reis qui ad eam confugissent parceret. Proinde homines de regno eius divinos honores imagini eius coeperunt impendere; huius exemplo plurimi claris suis mortuis imagines dedicarunt, et sicut ab idolo Beli caetera traxerunt originem, sic ab eius nomine generale nomen idolorum traxerunt. 4 Among those who utilized Peter Comestor's explanation were Godfrey of Viterbo, Vincent of Beauvais, Guido delle Colonne, Higden, the authors of Cursor Mundi and Gest Hystoriale, Trevisa, 1 Gest Hystoriale of the Destruction of Troy, ed. D. Donaldson and G. A. Panton (E.E.T.S., O.S., 39, 56), vv. 4360 ff. 2 Troy Book (E.E.T.S., E.S., 97, 103, 106), ii, 5557 ff. 3 The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troy, ed. H.

Of these Vincent,' Guido,2 Higden3 (first half of fourteenth century), and Lyndesay4 (ca. 1552) do little more than translate without further elaboration the account in the Historia Scholastica. Trevisa 5 (1387) translates into English the passage in the Polychronicon, and the author of the Gest Hys- toriale,6 Lydgate,7 and Caxton8 (through Lefevre), the passage in His- toria Destructionis Troiae. Godfrey of Viterbo (1185) and Gower present additional examples of idolatry. Godfrey follows the Belus- Ninus case with that of Apis and Serapis: His temporibus apud Egyptios constructum est idolum magnum in honorem Apis, regis Argiuorum; quidum tamen dicunt in honorem Joseph, qui liberauit eos a fame; quod idolum Serapis uocabatur, quasi idolum Apis.9 This is another illustration of the second way that idolatry might originate according to the Book of Wisdom (p. 398 above). Gower 10 assigns to Ninus and Serapis the second and third instances of idolatry; with Fulgentius (see p. 402 above) he thinks that Syro- phanes was responsible for the first case. The author of Cursor Mundi 11 (ca. 1300-1325) follows the Historia Scholastica account ex- cept that he substitutes Nimrod for Ninus; he may have learned to think of Ninus as of the lineage of Nimrod, and since he was more familiar with the word Nimrod because of its occurrence in the Bible, used it here; or it is possible that he had in mind the fact 1 Speculum Historiale, ed. cit., II, 10Q. 2 Historia Destructionis Troiae, ed. cit., h 5 ff. 3 Polychronicon, with English translation of John Trevisa, ed.

Tertullian (Ad Nationes, ii, 8) identifies Apis with Joseph; Augustine (De Civitate Dei, xvii, 7) and Isidore (Etymologiae, viii, 85) tell of the false worship of Isis. 10 Confessio Amantis, v, 1525 ff. 11 Cursor Mundi (E.E.T.S., O.S., 57, 99, 101), vv. 2289-2301.</page><page sequence="11">406 Euhemerism that earlier in the Historia Scholastica 1 Nimrod, by compelling men to worship fire, had been the first to instigate false worship of any kind. Isidore's explanation of how it happened that notable men had been regarded as gods by the pagans, with the list of those so honored in various places, was used by Vincent of Beauvais, Guido delle Colonne, Higden and Trevisa, the author of Gest Hystoriale, Lydgate, and Caxton. The earlier writers 2 for the most part keep close to Isidore's treatment; Higden and Trevisa, however, do not include the list of men worshipped in various places. Lydgate 3 elaborates and expands his material somewhat in order to make his narrative more interesting. To illustrate: the previous writers had inserted the list of gods worshipped in various places, as presented by Isidore (p. 402), with little elaboration and with only minor changes in the personnel. Lydgate, after the statement that the Egyptians worship Isis, pauses to explain that Isis was a king's daughter: pat tau3t hem first hir lond to ere and sowe, And also lettris for to rede and knowe, And in lettrure to sette her besynes - For which ping lei calle hir a goddes.4 He treats other names in similar fashion. In the Assembly of Gods, Lydgate again makes use of Isidore's explanation of how men had come to be worshipped. After enumerating various ways to account for the worship of the pagan gods, he explains that in ancient times the people were so rude: That what maner creature, man or woman, Cowde any nouelte contryue and conclude For the comon wele, all the multitude Of the comon peple a god shuld hym call, Or a goddesse, aftyr hit was fall.5 1 Genesis, xxxvii. 2 Vincent: Speculum Historiale, ed. cit., ii, 102.

As noted above, Caxton, in the Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye, follows his source (Lef6vre's Recueil), in giving two books of mytho- logical history before beginning the story proper of the fall of Troy. In the course of this history, he explains that Uranus had been the "first begynner of le fals paynems goddes" and makes use of Isidore's explanation of how men had come to be worshipped: In thys tyme hyt was so that whatsomeuer man practyqued or fond ony thynges prouffytable for the comyn wele he was recomanded solempnly and called and named a god after theyr folyssh and derke custome.' Caxton does not allude to Isidore by name. In Book iii, Caxton pauses to note the place of Guido's digression to treat of paganism, but, after giving the story of Ninus as noted in a previous section, he dispenses with the explanation and list of euhemerized gods as well as with the description of the gods (see p. 402). Of the writers who are indebted to any part of Isidore's treatment, it will be noted that Vincent of Beauvais, Guido delle Colonne, and, through Guido, the author of Gest Hystoriale, Lydgate, and, with modifications, Caxton make use of the whole section. While the majority of Mediaeval Latin and Middle-English authors are indebted to Isidore for their euhemeristic interpretations of the pagan gods, some refer to other sources or make use of the interpretation without reference to a particular authority. Since no clearly marked line of tradition is apparent in their treatments, the cases are conveniently presented briefly in chronological order. Of the Mediaeval Latin writers, Roger Bacon, about 1267, com- pleted his Opus Maius. Supported by quotations and references from Augustine, Clement of Alexandria, Isidore, Eusebius, Jerome, Solinus, and Josephus, he explains the human origin of Jo (Isis), Minerva, Prometheus, Atlas, Mercury, Aesculapius, and Apollo.2 Dante probably believed that the pagan gods were to be associated in some way with the planets of the same name.3 One passage, how- I Ed. cit., I, 10. 2 Opus Maius, ed.

When Dante comes upon Ephi- altes in hell, Virgil explains that he is being punished for having fought, with the other giants, against supreme Jove. Dante's sym- pathy is clearly with the gods; he does not mention them as demons; since he conceives of them in anthropomorphic form and certainly does not accept them as real divinities, he must conceive of them as men. The author of Speculum Morale2 (ca. 1310-1325) explains that man was responsible for the beginning of idolatry when he made images of his friends and fell into the worship of them. He refers to, and quotes, the explanation of the beginning of idolatry given in the Book of Wisdom (see p. 397 above). An occasional assumption of euhemerism is to be found in a Middle-English romance of Alexander, Kyng Alisaunder,3 composed probably before 1330, and translated for the most part from Eustache's Roman de Toute Chevalerie (ca. 1250). At one time the author refers to Tyre and Sidon as the realm of Apollo: Passith by Tire and by Cidoyne, There woned sumwhile kyng Appolyn.4 Apparently Apollo is conceived of as a mortal king; and Tyre and Sidon may be referred to as his seat, since Phoenicia was the seat of the Assyrian sun-god Baal. Later the author refers to Jupiter and Apollo as the cousins of Darius: Darie, the kyng of alle kynges, The godis that hath to ederlyng; For his neyce, Syble; cosynes Is Jubiter, and Appolyns.5 The passage may present further evidence of the euhemeristic inter- pretation; on the other hand, it seems more likely that it is simply 1 lnf., xxxi, 91 ff. 2 Speculum Morale (Strassburg, 1476), iii, 3, 27. 3 Kyng Alisaunder, in Metrical Romances of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Centuries, ed.

Two other Middle-English authors make general use of the in- terpretation. We have found that Lydgate, through Guido, was indebted to Isidore for euhemerism in the Troy Book and elsewhere. In one of his minor poems he again makes use of the interpretation when he mentions "Pallas Mynerva" as a woman with other cele- brated women such as Penelope, Medea, Helen, Griselda, and Mary. She is noted for her skill in eloquence: Gresylde whylome hade gret pacyence, As hit was preved fer up in Italye, Pallas Mynerva haden eloquence ... In treating the Arthurian material, there was very little occasion or opportunity to introduce references to classical paganism. In the prose MIerlin, composed 1450-1460, the author, in telling of the sword that King Rion carried, treats of Hercules and Vulcan as though they were merely men and historical characters. Hercules is an adventurer, an ancestor of King Rion, and Vulcan is a blacksmith of reputation: ffor, as the book seith, it was some tyme Hercules that ledde Jason in to the Ile of Colchos ... and with that swerde dide Hercules sle many a geaunte . .. and the booke seith that Vulcan i-forged that swerde in the tyme of Adrastus, the kyng of Greece,2 The passage is only a translation from the Roman de Merlin,3 the author's source. It is worthy of note that Chaucer nowhere subscribes to the euhemeristic interpretation.4 1 Minor Poems (E.E.T.S., E.S., 107), "A Valentine to Her that Exceedeth All," stanza 10, p. 307. 2 Prose Merlin (E.E.T.S., O.S., 10, 21, 36, 112), xx, p. 339. 3 Lestoire de Merlin, Vol. II of The Vulgate Version of the Arthurian Romances, edited by H.

As Eurydice was fleeing from Arystyus she stepped upon a serpent, fell into a deadly swoon, and was carried off by the "goddes Infernall." Orpheus heard the commotion made by her attendant, who told him what had happened: Allace! Erudices, your quene, Is with &lt;the&gt; fary tane before myne ene. Since Orpheus was so inflamed with wrath that he was unable to understand her, she repeats: Scho trampit on a serpent wennomouss And fell in swoun, with pat Je quene of fary Claucht hir wp sone, and furth with hir can cary. This is as far as the mingling of classical and fairy folk is carried. The passage reminds one of the line in the Merchant's Tale where Pluto is spoken of as "the king of fay8rye" (C. T., E 2227).
