<plain_text><page sequence="1">Erin Smith Gender and National Identity in The Journals of Susanna Moodie and Tamsen Donner: A Woman's Journey Margaret Atwood's The Journals of Susanna Moodie (1970) and Ruth Whitman's Tamsen Donner: A Woman's Journey (1977) are collec- tions by twentieth-century female poets reinterpreting the experiences of nineteenth-century pioneer women. Atwood's collection was in- spired by the voice of Susanna Strickland Moodie, an English immi- grant to Canada in 1832 who wrote two books about her experiences: Roughing It in the Bush (1852) and Life in the Clearings (1853).' Whitman retraced the 1846 route of the Donner party west from Missouri to California, creating in poetry, prose, and scraps of historical docu- ments a journal like the lost diary Tamsen Donner is known to have kept. Atwood and Whitman both negotiate the meaning of gender and national identity in their rewriting of the past. Both poets portray the experience of the frontier as distinctly gendered. As pioneer women, both Atwood's Moodie and Whitman's Donner do not participate with the enthusiasm of their husbands in the wilderness journey. Yet the negotiation of national identity is markedly different for Atwood and Whitman. Atwood's work is informed by what she calls "the national mental illness ... of Canada" - paranoid schizophrenia;2 Whitman's work, by what Frederick Jackson Turner has called the primary organizing principle of the American character - the possi- bility of starting over again and again provided by the frontier.3 It is important to note that the constructions of national iden- tity advanced by Whitman and Atwood in their fictionalized depic- tions of the past are personal resolutions, not universally held Copyright ? 1992 by Frontiers Editorial Collective. 75</page><page sequence="2">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 notions about national character. Turner's frontier hypothesis has long been criticized by social scientists and historians. After Turner's death in the 1930s, younger scholars criticized the hypothesis for methodo- logical reasons,4 and feminist scholars have attacked it for its specifi- cally male, Eurocentric focus5 (a project in which I believe Ruth Whitman's poetry participates). Nevertheless, the romance or myth of the American West endures in fiction and popular culture. It is Whit- man's engagement with this myth (she calls the Donner party's jour- ney a "typical American" event) and her qualification of it by bringing gender into consideration that is interesting. Atwood's notion of a schizophrenic Canadian self has also been questioned. Frank Davey argues that many Canadian works from the late 1960s and early 1970s (Atwood's included) erred "in their creation of overly narrow cultural definitions."'7 Nevertheless, these personal negotiations of national identity are suggestive in light of the collections which are in other ways so similar. The relationships of Whitman and Atwood to the historical fig- ures of Donner and Moodie are mediated by their own needs as poets and their own placement in history. Atwood read Susanna Moodie's books, Roughing It in the Bush and Life in the Clearings, and was disap- pointed in them as texts. However, the personality of Moodie was striking to Atwood because she believed it revealed many traits that persist in the Canadian character. The poems, Atwood writes, "were suggested by Mrs. Moodie's books, though it was not her conscious voice but the other voice running like a counterpoint through her work that made the most impression on me" (Journals of Susanna Moodie, 63). Although the arrangement of Atwood's poems loosely follows the events in Moodie's life, Atwood insists that the poems "have detached themselves from the books in the same way that other poems detach themselves from the events that give rise to them" (JSM, 63). Ruth Whitman was inspired more by the story of the Donners than by any particular text. Tamsen Donner is known to have kept a journal of the westward journey, but all of her writings, with the exception of three letters, are lost.8 Whitman sought and received a National Endowment for the Arts grant to physically retrace the Don- ner party's route to California so that she could experience the Ameri- can landscape that Donner had seen. Drawing on her own diary of this journey and historical accounts of the trek, Whitman writes her ver- sion of the events in the voice of Tamsen Donner. The narrators of both poetry collections, Atwood's Moodie and Whitman's Donner, are distinct from the historical women. Unless 76</page><page sequence="3">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 otherwise specified, the Donner and the Moodie I refer to in this article are the constructions of Whitman and Atwood. The only substantial correspondences between these constructions and the real historical women are the events of their lives that Atwood and Whitman bring into their fictionalized accounts. What is the significance of the historical Tamsen Donner and Susanna Moodie for Ruth Whitman and Margaret Atwood more than a century later? Both Moodie and Donner were women writers. In addition to her two books, Moodie wrote serial novels, short stories, sketches, and verse from 1839 to 1851 for Literary Garland and contrib- uted to and edited with her husband Victoria Magazine: a Cheap Peri- odical for the Canadian People from 1847 to 1848.9 Donner (like Whitman) was a teacher and a poet. Donner's work was published in the local newspaper, The Sangamon Journal, in Springfield, Illinois (Tamsen Donner, 9). In short, Moodie and Donner are literary foremoth- ers of Atwood and Whitman. Atwood writes of the importance of earlier women writers for those of her generation. "We read writing by women," Atwood as- serts, because "we were curious about the lives of these women. How had they managed it?" (combining the traditional roles of women with careers as successful writers).'0 Atwood asks, "Could you be female, a writer, be Food at it, get published, not commit suicide, and be Canadian too?"' Moodie was once living proof that one could be all of these things. Whitman more explicitly places herself as a descendant of Don- ner, as one who is recuperating a lost history of personal importance. Whitman sees her own diary of the journey to California as "writing Tamsen Donner's lost journal" (TD, 9). Whitman writes that once she had identified Donner by name, "I recognized her immediately, as though she were someone I had known" (TD, 9). This searching into the past is, then, not only an examination of national history, but also a search for histories of people like oneself. The collections are part of the project of rewriting the past to make sense of the present and the place of a white Canadian or American woman in it. In this way, the collections tell us more about Atwood and Whitman than about Moodie and Donner. One reviewer of At- wood's collection called The Journals of Susanna Moodie "A Self-Portrait of Margaret Atwood."'2 The distinctiveness of Moodie's and Donner's experiences as pioneer women should not be overlooked. The first pages of Tamsen Donner hold juxtaposed documents from the histori- cal record - among them, one by a man and one by a woman. Eleutheros Cooke wrote in 1858, "Where is the West? / Who shall fix 77</page><page sequence="4">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 its limits? / He who attempts it will soon learn / that it is not a fixed but a floating line" (TD, 13). This sense of boundless possibility for expansion and reaching toward ever-expanding limits is qualified by the second quotation - a letter sent by Elvira Powers Hynes to her sister in Illinois in March of 1852. She writes, "For my part I have no desire to go anywhere. I am far enough west now and do believe some people might go west until they have been around the world and never find a place to stop" (TD, 17). Here Whitman engages Turner's mythical American West. This West was a largely masculine construction. It was men who found on the frontier a place to prove manhood, to practice rugged individual- ism, to conquer untamed land. At the time Whitman was writing Tamsen Donner, early feminist scholarship held that most of the women who went west were unwilling immigrants.13 The predominant belief was that women accompanied husbands who had decided it was best for the family to go west, yet most of them undertook the trek west- ward with a distinct lack of enthusiasm, saddened to leave homes, friends, and family in the East. The historical Moodie, like the historical women whose words are printed in Whitman's collection, was not fond of the wilderness.'4 She wrote Roughing It in the Bush to warn prospective immigrants of her class "not to take up grants and pitch their tents in the wilderness, and by so doing reduce themselves and their families to hopeless poverty."'5 The treks westward in The Journals of Susanna Moodie and Tamsen Donner are indeed far less captivating to a feminine imagination than to a masculine one. For both Atwood's Moodie and Whitman's Don- ner, Nature the Monster16 is the original dominant image of the wil- derness, although both women are later reconciled with nature. Whitman's Donner blames her initial optimism about the voyage west on the fact that she "forgot the anger of the land" (TD, 15). The voyage, conceived as a summer holiday, ends with the Donner party stranded in the mountains without provisions by an early winter. Neither Don- ner nor her husband completes the journey, and many of the party turn to cannibalism in order to survive. The images Donner finds in nature even in the first part of the voyage are stark, alien, and suggest violence and death. Along the prairie she discovers a dead ox, two graves of children, "once loved relics / flung out / to scorch and crack / on the hot prairie" (TD, 29), "barren" rocks, "twisted" boughs (TD, 34), and "violent" peaks (TD, 31). Atwood's Moodie finds similar images. She sees "vistas of deso- lation," "barren sand," "bone-white driftlogs" (JSM, 11) and hears 78</page><page sequence="5">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 "malice in the tree's whispers" (JSM, 13). She feels the need to arm herself with man-made things and logic against the destructive, anar- chic forces of nature in "The Two Fires." As the fire burns outside, a "shapeless raging," Moodie concentrates on "form, geometry, the hu- man / architecture of the house, square / closed doors, proved roof- beams, / the logic of windows" (JSM, 22). Moodie's defense against the chaos of nature is all that is even, regular, closed, and explicable by rational standards. When the house catches fire at a later date, Moodie is devastated to see "all those corners / and straight lines flaming" (JSM, 22). She expects destruction from the wilderness but not from the man-made world. Both Atwood's Susanna Moodie and Whitman's Tamsen Donner are preoccupied with learning to understand the alien (and initially hostile) wilderness. This preoccupation takes the form of the desire to "read" nature as one can read language. Tamsen Donner sees the vast expanse of prairie as a giant page of text: "The stretches themselves are punctuated here and there with little isolated exclamation points - a house, a barn, a shield of trees planted by an emigrant" (TD, 20). The things that human beings have brought to the wilderness are punctuation. Just as punctuation orders language, it is human things which give the indifferent wilderness order and coherence. Donner also explains her growing understanding of the rules of wilderness survival in terms of reading. She tells us, "I learn to read water by willows and alders" (TD, 35). Moodie is also preoccupied throughout Journal 1 with language. She must learn the nonrational language of the wilderness in order to understand the new rules of existence. Moodie herself is "a word / in a foreign language" (JSM, 11) in the sense that she belongs to civi- lized, rational England, and she has arrived in the wilderness where those civilized rules of existence no longer apply.'7 Moodie's igno- rance of the nonrational language of the wilderness makes her first attempts at communication clumsy. She is "a minor invalid, expected to make / inept remarks, / futile and spastic gestures" (JSM, 14). Not knowing the syntax which organizes the wilderness world, Moodie finds it impossible to make any sense of it. Her "damaged / knowing of the language means / prediction is forever impossible" (JSM, 15). Moodie, like Donner, wants to learn to read nature as one learns to read text. In "Paths and Thingscape," Moodie speaks of those who "have dreams / of birds flying in the shapes of letters; the sky's codes" and those who "dream also / the significance of numbers (count / petals of certain flowers)" (JSM, 20). Here Moodie at- tempts to apply the languages that order the man-made world 79</page><page sequence="6">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 (words, numbers) to the natural world. Further, the earlier settlers have "bent the early trees / so that they grew to signals" (JSM, 20). Once again, it is the human inhabitants who shape nature into mean- ingful and readable symbols. Moodie wants to learn the meaning of these signs - words in a language she does not yet know. Both Atwood's Journals and Whitman's Tamsen Donner share an interest in metamorphosis as well. The meaning of the metamorphosis into nature, however, is not the same, and this is where the authors' perceptions of national identity become significant. For Atwood, metamorphosis is a way to heal the split between the rational/civi- lized/masculine side and the emotional/animal/feminine side of hu- man beings. For Whitman, metamorphosis to nature is just another sort of rebirth which characterizes experience in the United States. Margaret Atwood describes Susanna Moodie as "divided down the middle" and marked by a "violent duality" (JSM, 62) that Atwood continues to find in the twentieth-century Canadian character. This duality can be described as mind/body, reason/emotion, civiliza- tion/nature, male/female. Atwood uses these polarities throughout her work - in the image of the neck separating the (actually united) head and body in "Surfacing," for example. Atwood attempts to heal this split through rediscovery of the lost, nonrational side of human nature. Atwood's Moodie arrives in the wilderness of Canada an utterly rational person. The wilderness is as much a figure for the unexplored animal self within Moodie as it is for her physical surroundings.'8 Laura Groening maintains that Moodie, at this point, is "fully formed by reason, civilization, and man-made order."' Moodie's preoccupa- tion with language throughout Journal 1 is caused by the failure of the rational, civilized laws which previously ordered her world. She needs to learn the nonrational syntax of the wilderness in order to understand the animal part of herself. Moodie finds she needs "wolf's eyes to see / the truth" (JSM, 13), because her civilized vision is inadequate to understand the bush or her own unconscious. At first, the metamorphosis to nature (by which the external ["Other"] wilderness is recognized by Moodie as part of herself) is involuntary. The wilderness invades her body. In "The Planters," Moodie finds herself "surrounded, stormed, broken / in upon by branches, roots, tendrils, the dark / side of light" (JSM, 17). The wilderness at this point is an assault on Moodie's body, an unwanted invader. In "The Wereman," Moodie believes that her husband is taken over by the wilderness once he leaves her sight and that she herself is changed. "I can't think / what he will see / when he opens 80</page><page sequence="7">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 the door" (JSM, 19), she says. When Moodie finally does look in the mirror, she sees that she is becoming part of the wilderness. She finds "skin thickened / with bark and the white hairs of roots," "fingers brittle as twigs," and eyes like "buds" (JSM, 24-25). Moodie's metamorphosis is not, however, complete. In "Depar- ture From the Bush" (at the end of Journal 1), she finds that the animals who had "arrived to inhabit" her (JSM, 26) leave as she departs from the bush. She writes, "rounding the first hill, I was / (instantaneous) / unlived in: They had gone" (JSM, 27). Moodie has not yet, however, mastered the language of nature and nonrationality. She thinks that there is "something they almost taught me / I came away not having learned" (JSM, 27). The theme of metamorphosis is not nearly so prominent in Jour- nal 2 once Moodie has left the bush, but it does reappear. In "Dream 1: The Bush Garden," the strawberries leave bloodstains on Moodie's hands. In "Dream 2: Brian the Still-hunter," Brian tells Moodie that when he hunts, he feels his "skin grow fur" and his "head heavy with antlers" (JSM, 36). "Dream 3: Night Bear Which Frightened Cattle" includes a bear which "condense[s] itself among the trees" and Moodie's own feet "grow intangible" (JSM, 38-39) as the line between the mental realm of ideas and the realm of physical reality fades. Nonrational experience returns to Moodie once she has left the bush only in dreams, where the rules of everyday logic do not apply. In "The Deaths of the Other Children," Atwood's Moodie links the decomposition of the body into soil with metamorphosis into nature. She writes of "my disintegrated children / Everywhere I walk, along / the overgrowing paths, my skirt / tugged at by the spreading briers / they catch at my heels with their fingers" (JSM, 41). The ambiguity of the construction makes no differentiation between the children and the briers. It is the buried children who have fingers and the briers that catch at her heels, but they have become one for Moodie.20 By the end of Journal 2, Moodie comes to fully understand her split self. In "The Double Voice," she explains the two different sides of herself which "took turns using" her eyes (JSM, 42). The rational, civilized self "had manners . . . composed uplifting verse / and expended sentiment upon the poor" (JSM, 42). The other self has natural, physical knowledge - "that men sweat / always and drink often, / that pigs are pigs" (JSM, 42). By this point, the animal nature of the wilderness that was previously present only in the landscape is also located within Moodie herself. 81</page><page sequence="8">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 It is not surprising, then, that in Journal 3 the aging Moodie discovers her longing for union with the natural world. In "Wish: Metamorphosis to Heraldic Emblem," she sits in the civilized, domes- tic setting of a parlor but fantasizes she "will prowl and slink ... with new / formed plumage... my fingers / curving and scaled" (JSM, 49). No longer is the wilderness a hostile invader; it is a longed-for escape from civilization and everyday rationality. At the lunatic asylum in Toronto, Moodie gets a second chance at the knowledge the wilderness was about to offer her when she left the bush. The knowledge of the natural world and madness (the height of nonrationality) are thus equated. Moodie and her companions climb the stairs of the asylum, finding patients on higher floors increasingly less rational. The third and final floor does not have people at all, but landscape. This landscape, however, is distinctly anthropomorphic: "One of the rocks / sighed and rolled over" while Moodie watched (JSM, 51). Her companions want her to leave the asylum, but she refuses. "The landscape was saying something" (JSM, 51), she insists. Moodie is finally going to learn the language of nature, nonrationality and madness. As she claims, "the air / was about to tell me / all kinds of answers" (JSM, 51). The scene of metamorphosis in Whitman's Tamsen Donner is very different. It is filled with unity and harmony instead of "violent dual- ity" and contributes to the theme of rebirth that runs through the entire poem. Donner's moment of metamorphosis occurs after she has sent the children to California with a rescue party. She remains behind with her dying husband because she says, "I will not leave him to die without my comfort" (TD, 67). Later, having covered her husband's dead body with a clean, white sheet, Donner leaves the human world in mystical dizziness induced by hunger. Her body is never found. The entry reads: April 12, 1847: Hunger. The lightness of it. I feel my legs will not hold me up any longer. Sounds enter the senses sharply, colors are very bright, I am filled with light, a music the saints sought and called God. I am not quite in touch with the ground. I am outside my own body. It would be easy to join the air and float into noth- ingness (TD, 72). The tone of this passage differs radically from Susanna Moodie's account of the hostile invasion of her body by branches and twigs. Tamsen Donner's metamorphosis is "easy." A language of mystical communion, not enemy invasion, characterizes the entry. 82</page><page sequence="9">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 Donner associates resurrection and rebirth with the forces of na- ture earlier in the journal as well. She met George Donner, her second husband, when she was a thirty-five-year-old widow whose first hus- band and two children had been killed by fever. She emigrated to Springfield, Illinois, from North Carolina to care for her brother's children but felt that the joy in her own life was past. The widowed Tamsen had thought "my body would not stir again / my lifelong fires were banked" (TD, 27) until she met George Donner in an Illinois meadow. "In his rich earth / winter buds unclenched their tightness / under his sun his unaccustomed rain / I shed my widowhood / and let a new self burgeon" (TD, 27), Donner explains. The metaphorical language linking her rebirth through love to the blooming of winter buds is an almost (but not quite) metamorphosis to nature. The meta- morphosis is suggested in language but does not occur. Donner's journey from east to west is also a journey from past to present and future, a journey Donner describes in terms of rebirth. Almost as soon as the wagons leave Missouri, Donner finds herself back in childhood, watching gulls along the Atlantic beaches of Mas- sachusetts. She repeatedly mistakes the hawks of the prairie for seagulls:"In these feathery seas of grass / traveling toward the steep / heart of America, why do I / keep watching for seagulls?" (TD, 22) she asks. As the journey west continues, Donner's memories proceed in chronological sequence until the present. Donner casts the epochs of her life not in terms of phases, but in terms of entirely new lives. Her first life was in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, with her first husband and their two children. She had thought that "this would be my life forever" (TD, 23), but all three died of a fever within two months. "So I began a new second life" (TD, 23), Donner explains. This second life is in Illinois with George Donner and their children. The voyage west is yet another sort of rebirth. Donner asserts, "I carry my roots with me into a third life. I am willing to make a home wherever we choose to sleep" (TD, 23). Given this emphasis on continuous death and rebirth, Donner's metamorphosis to nature and death in the mountains can be cast as simply another life - her fourth. Two incidents near the close of the first section ("Prairie") connect Donner's personal rebirth, her personal past and present, with that of her nation. At Fort Laramie the Donner party pauses to toast friends back home in the East as these same friends simultaneously raise a toast to them in the West. This symbolic linking of east and west is a linking of past and present. Donner writes, "So do we make a link / between what we were / and what we have become" (TD, 33). As she 83</page><page sequence="10">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 insists, "I... feel in my flesh / the stretch of the land / as we give it birth / the long spill of it / unrolling before us" (TD, 33). Donner's rebirth into a third life is here explicitly linked to the birth of the nation she inhabits - and creates - as they travel west. The voyage into the wilderness is an act of completion, not (as for Moodie) of fragmenta- tion. As emigrants toasting their relatives in the East, they are "bind- ing together / two halves of a whole / as we touch each other / across a thousand miles" (TD, 33). On July 18, 1846, the Donner party reaches the Great Divide. It is here that Donner's looking backward stops. She writes, "Having traced ourselves back to our Atlantic beginnings / we... leap to a new love plunging westward / where once we looked backward all the way" (TD, 37). Once again, the voyage west is cast as an act of comple- tion. Donner writes that "we pass across the invisible boundary / that divides self from self / and move forward heartlong towards the other sea / a twin / a mirror of ourselves" (TD, 37). The frontier for Donner is not "Other" as it is for Moodie, but a twin or mirror of Self. This preoccupation with continuous rebirth and starting over is distinctly "American." Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 identified the frontier as the primary organizing principle of the American character: "American social development has been continually beginning over again on the frontier. This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continu- ous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating the American character."21 Whitman's concern is to exam- ine the effects of this mythology of rebirth and limitless growth, just as Atwood's concern is to examine what she sees to be a determining feature of the Canadian character, a divided self. In the second and third sections of Donner's journal, "Desert" and "Mountain," Turner's mythical West is qualified as the woman's less enthusiastic view becomes more prominent. The Donner party takes a shortcut, which results in their being lost and still in the mountains when winter comes. The men of the party were perfectly willing to take this shortcut, but Tamsen Donner was not pleased. Section two of Donner's journal begins with a historical document - a fragment of a letter written by a member of the Donner party. It describes Tamsen Donner as "gloomy, sad, and dispirited" because her husband and the others had chosen to leave the established trail to take a shortcut described to them by "a man about whom they knew nothing but who was probably some selfish adventurer" (TD, 39). The trail taken soon disappears, leaving the Donner party "trav- eling blind" (TD, 45). After wandering the desert lost, they reach the 84</page><page sequence="11">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 Great Salt Lake. Donner writes, "If I were leading the emigrants, I would be tempted to settle and build a new city here" (TD, 46). She is not, however, leading the emigrants. Men with an insatiable appetite for westward expansion are. Completely without power to stop the party, Donner divorces herself from responsibility for the course of events.22 "I am not inside this story / I am sitting beside my husband / a frame / to the picture" (TD, 53), she writes. As a woman, she is unable to influence the course of events and must fulfill the role of unwilling victim. "Mountain," part three of the diary, opens with the ominous declaration that "there was a film of ice on the bucket of water this / morning" (TD, 57). George Donner cuts his hand on a chisel. The party is stranded in the mountains by an early blizzard and forced to winter there in a crude lean-to that Tamsen Donner must "make another nest" (TD, 59). The "smell of decay" (TD, 61) from the infected wound on George Donner's hand permeates the final pages of the poem. Kenneth Pitchford describes this infection as a sort of "terminal mas- culinism,"23 a disease of excess developing out of an unqualified, unreasoned pursuit of "progress." While the Donners are stranded in a squalid, freezing hole, gnaw- ing on bark and twigs to kill the hunger from which they are suffering, Tamsen Donner increasingly finds solace in the wilderness. "These mountains / comfort me" (TD, 65), she claims. "These shapes [of trees] these colors cleanse my eyes / and I turn back to our evil-smelling cave / a little stronger to confront / the next meal and the next day and the next" (TD, 65). Donner painfully sends her children on to California with a rescue party, electing to stay with her dying hus- band. As she comes to grips with his imminent death, nature is in sympathy with her. "The sun stays hidden / for months the sky has wept its snow" (TD, 71), Donner writes. Her metamorphosis to nature, discussed earlier, follows. Perhaps the most enlightening illustration of Atwood's and Whit- man's notions of national identity in The Journals of Susanna Moodie and Tamsen Donner is their endings. Both Susanna Moodie and Tamsen Donner end up dead, as part of the natural world, yet both speak in some way from beyond the grave. Tamsen Donner ends with a poem entitled "Where is the West": If my boundary stops here I have daughters to draw new maps on the world they will draw the lines of my face 85</page><page sequence="12">FRONTIERS, VOL. XIII, NO. 2 they will draw with my gestures my voice they will speak my words thinking they have invented them They will invent them They will invent me I will be planted again and again I will wake in the eyes of their children's children they will speak my words (TD, 75) The American mythology of endless progress and continual rebirth has been qualified by the second and third parts of Donner's journal, but it is reaffirmed at the close. Donner may not have succeeded, but she has given birth to her inheritors, who will continue to "draw new maps on the world." The unity of past and future claimed in the first part of the journal returns. Donner is at one with her inheritors; they speak with her voice and gestures. Susanna Moodie, eternally divided, finds no such faith in pro- gress. She has two sets of thoughts from underground. In the first, she maintains a simultaneous love and hate for Canada. She says her "mind saw double" (JSM, 54) when she claimed to love the country. She finishes singing the praises of Belleville only to state that "it is still no place for an english gentleman" (JSM, 55). Moodie is also at odds with her successors. She names the people of the twentieth century "the inheritors, the raisers / of glib superstructures" (JSM, 57). She calls for their destruction: "O topple this glass pride, fireless / rivetted babylon" (JSM, 57). Tamsen Donner becomes part of the mythical American West, but Susanna Moodie, who has "become the spirit of the land she once hated" (JSM, 64), ends up an old woman on a Toronto bus tearing down the city with "secret hatpins" from her eyes (JSM, 61). Moodie still suffers from a divided self, a condition Atwood defines as charac- teristically Canadian, and Tamsen Donner has become part of that faith in "progress," continual rebirth and the unity of past and future that Whitman, following Turner, sees as distinctly American. 86</page><page sequence="13">FRONTIERS, VOL.

See Lillian Schlissel, Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey (New York: Schocken Books, 1982), 6. This position has since been called into question. A more complex (and realistic) picture of women's frontier experiences holds that women may have had different motivations than men (and from each other) for going west and different fantasies about the frontier, but they were by no means all unwilling immigrants. Two more recent studies include Annette Kolodny, The Land Before Her: Fantasy and Experience of the American Frontiers, 1630-1860 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1984) and Carol Fairbanks, Prairie Women: Images in Ameri- can and Canadian Fiction (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1986). 14. Similarities in women's perceptions of the West (in history and in literature) across national boundaries are particularly interesting in light of the very different charac- ter of westward expansion in Canada and the United States. Westward expansion occurred somewhat later in Canada, and settlers were preceded by the mounted police and often by the railroad. Further, the Canadian experience was charac- terized by far less conflict with natives. W. J. Eccles argues in The Canadian Frontier 1534-1760 (Albuquerque, University of New Mexico Press, 1969, 3) that "if the Anglo-American frontier is accepted as the norm, then Canada can hardly be said to have had a frontier at all." For an extended discussion of Canadian myths about the West in literature, see Dick Harrison, Unnamed Country: The Struggle for a Canadian Prairie Fiction (Edmonton, Canada: University of Alberta Press, 1977). 87</page><page sequence="14">FRONTIERS, VOL.
