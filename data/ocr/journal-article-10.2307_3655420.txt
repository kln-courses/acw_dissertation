Providing clearer links throughout between personal experience and anthro- pological insight would have yielded a more satisfying book.

Something Dangerous: Emergent and Chang- ing Illicit Drug Use and Community Health. Merrill Singer. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, 2006. vi + 274 pp. Lee D. Hoffer Department of Psychiatry Washington University School of Medicine In recent years, there have been many re- ports and numerous studies on trends in the use of MDMA (Ecstasy) and other illicit substances euphemistically labeled "club drugs." Discussing this, as well as other ways illicit substance use has changed within the United States, Merrill Singer's Some- thing Dangerous: Emergent and Changing Illicit Drug Use and Community Health is a comprehensive and timely book. More importantly, however, this work makes a significant contribution to an understud- ied area in the field of drug abuse: un- derstanding the importance of change and transformation in the consumption of illicit substances. The subject of this book is illicit-drug- use dynamics, a useful term defined by the author as the, "processes and patterns of change and transformation in illicit drug consumption" (p. 10). Drug-use dynamics encompasses a complicated range of issues, including: the development of new illicit drugs, changes and trends in drug consump- tion patterns, the emergence of new popu- lations of drug users, and new settings in which drugs are used. Although the inter- related facets of this concept are daunting, Singer provides a theoretically informed, research-based approach that makes the topic accessible. A wide range of audiences, including health professionals, policy mak- ers, and drug researchers, as well as un- dergraduates studying various fields of so- cial science, will find this book useful and informative. Singer begins his book by defining Criti- cal Medical Anthropology (CMA), the the- oretical framework he uses to make sense of drug use dynamics. As one of a group of an- thropologists responsible for defining CMA, his discussion is nonjargoned, straightfor- ward, and easy to follow. This is a well- organized description accurately comparing CMA with a number of other perspectives used to understand illicit drug use. Referenc- ing its historical orientation, Singer writes "CMA as an anthropological perspective is concerned with variation across local cases and the agency of individuals and groups in creating the social events and processes in which they participate" (p. 26). Chap- ters 2 through 4 effectively demonstrate how this approach informs understanding the history of illicit drug use in the United States. Starting with the arrival of Europeans in the New World, progressing to tobacco and opium use in the colonial era and end- ing with club-drug use in the 21st cen- tury, Singer's analysis of the emergence and transformations of illicit substances in the United States is both detailed and thor- ough. In particular, his discussion of how the big three (heroin, cocaine, and mari- juana) emerged, continue to reemerge, and become relevant with respect to different populations of users, settings, and health</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 267 problems through time is superlative. The history of cocaine epitomizes the detail and CMA perspective Singer brings to this anal- ysis and demonstrates why this discussion is critical. Cocaine emerged in the 1800s in the U.S. South as a medicinal drink reputed to cure a host of illnesses. The Parker-Davis company isolated the drug and expanded its use as a medicine by making it avail- able in tablets, ointments, sprays, and in- jections. However, Singer notes, "As with the opiates and marijuana, societal attitudes about cocaine were colored by racism" (p. 51). Even though its expense restricted use among African American populations, cocaine was coupled with a fear of black violence in the South, a fact that served to validate and motivate lynching, segrega- tion, and other civil rights abuses. After the Harrison act of 1914 criminalized its use, snorting cocaine reemerged during Prohi- bition in the after-hours and jazz clubs of the inner city. However, having been aban- doned by whites, the inner city was now in disrepair and the drug was marginalized as part of poor African American and minor- ity neighborhoods. After the 1960s, coun- tercultural revolution softened mainstream societies views on illicit drugs, Singer notes how cocaine reappeared with a vengeance. By the mid-1970s, snorting and injecting co- caine was popular in Hollywood and among high rollers. The drug and its paraphernalia (the spoon) and sales embodied conspicuous consumption and the glamorous fast-paced 1980s. "Almost effortlessly, it seems, an ille- gal substance that carried stiff penalties for possession and use was absorbed into the upper-class armory of weapons of social dis- play" (p. 78). Of course, with the advent of crack, the glamor of the drug came to an abrupt end in the mid-1980s. The crack epidemic quickly dominated the illicit-drug landscape, devastating lives and communi- ties. Most recently, because of its dominance and popularity, some users unable to acquire powder cocaine have turned to liquefying crack to inject. After demonstrating the historical impor- tance of illicit drug transformations, Singer outlines the central role young drug user's play in directing these dynamics. In addi- tion to addressing the novelty seeking and risk taking of youth, chapter 5 provides succinct examples of social epidemic, dif- fusion of innovation, and social network models of change. Whereas this chapter is instructive, its lessons are put to use in chap- ter 6, which is devoted to making sense of "new" illicit drug trends among young am- phetamine, MDMA, ketamine, GHB, and pharmaceutical users. This is the most de- tailed portion of the book and, reflecting the most up-to-date data, it will likely garner the most interest. Describing the issues, Singer expertly brings to bear numerous examples from his nearly two decades of fieldwork at the Hispanic Health Council's Center of Community Health Research in Hartford, Connecticut. Showing how these dynamics are influenced by broader social systems, one of the most intriguing examples outlined in this chapter is the mutual growth of At- tention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and the illicit use of Ritalin. Another important influence on illicit drug dynamics Singer recognizes is the il- legal drug economy, specifically the pro- duction side of this economy. Providing consumers with new forms of illicit drugs clearly impacts their use, especially when substances are made cheaper (e.g., crack), easier to use (e.g., heroin smoking) and more potent (e.g., methamphetamines). The next two chapters depart from Singers presentation of describing drug-use dynamics to discussing the outcomes of these dynamics. Here we learn about the war on drugs (ch. 8) and the health consequences of illicit drug use (ch. 9). Although Singer notes how these topics have been shaped by the numerous developments, transfor- mations, and changes previously presented,</page><page sequence="3">268 Medical Anthropology Quarterly these chapters stand alone in presenting two of the most consequential problems of illicit drug use. Singer concludes his analysis of illicit- drug-use dynamics by providing a clear recommendation on how current efforts to monitor drug epidemics can be improved. Noting that, "Ethnography is especially useful for the detection of emergent drug use practices and the monitoring of the diffusion of drug-related behaviors because it is a highly porous approach that imposes little in the way of research control over the domain of study" (pp. 232-234), this chapter elaborates "ethnoepidemiology," the marriage of ethnography and epidemi- ology. Although this is not a new solution, it is discussed in detail, well situated within the current efforts of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and serves as an effective illustration for students of applied medical anthropology. In sum, this book covers an enormous amount of material with only one minor shortcoming. Although the crack epidemic of the 1980s is discussed in detail in chap- ters 7 and 8, it is less prominent within the larger history of illicit drugs in America. However, despite this, Singer's analysis of the "sociohistoric and cultural contexts" that have shaped illicit-drug-use patterns in the United States delivers. Furthermore, as an effective example of CMA, this book successfully introduces important social, cultural, political-economic, crim- inal justice, and health factors of illicit drug use. Finally, recognizing that "new drugs, old drugs in new forms, new drug combinations, new ways of using drugs, new drug-using populations, and new drug use environments will continue to appear over time" (p. 235), this work introduces a significant concept to the field: drug-use dynamics. As a solid presentation of the his- torical and modern problems of illicit drug use in America, students and researcher will learn much from this work. Tribal Health and Medicines. A. K. Kalla and P. C. Joshi, eds. New Delhi, India: Concept Publishing, 2004. xxi + 447 pp. Satish Kedia Department of Anthropology The University of Memphis Sunil Khanna Department of Anthropology Oregon State University This edited volume, based on papers pre- sented at a workshop entitled "Emerging Issues in Tribal Health and Medicines," reports on recent ethnomedical research conducted among tribal groups in India, whose population of 67.7 million consti- tutes the largest such concentration in the world. The collection reflects the tradition of postindependence anthropological work in India, which challenges the exotic and ro- manticized images of tribal communities so common in the works of colonial anthropol- ogists, and focuses on topics such as ethnic revitalization, self-determination, tribe- state relationships, environmental resources allocation, and health and medical practices. The volume's 30 chapters are divided into five parts. Part 1, "Clinical and Bio- genetic Aspects," examined health issues among tribal societies from a biomedical perspective, using a variety of methodolo- gies. For example, overview chapters by G. K. Kshatriya and S. S. Rath employ ethn- odemographic and medical characteristics surveys, whereas those by P. D. Sharma and S. S. Gusain on tribal children utilize anthropomorphic measurements. This sec- tion establishes the need to address mental and physical health problems among tribal communities and demonstrates that doing so would benefit the general population in terms of knowledge gained and misinforma- tion corrected. M. Gupta's chapter argues about how the national health care system has never taken tribal health seriously, par- ticularly in terms of addressing neurologi- cal disorders such as epilepsy.
