<plain_text><page sequence="1">Between the Academy and the Avant-Garde: Carl Einstein and Fritz Saxl Correspond SPYROS PAPAPETROS Can we rethink art-historical discourse by recasting one of its most "academic" (to use a term of Bataille 's) or even "conservative" (to use a term of Carl Einstein's) media, that of editorial correspondence? Moreover, what if we attempt to expand such correspondence from an epistolary exchange between two editors to a tenta- tive conceptual agreement between the institutions that these two individuals repre- sent? And what if the expressed objective of this correspondence - that is, the prospect of collaboration - ultimately fails: what form of intellectual or methodolog- ical affinities between the two parties might their aborted communication ultimate- ly disclose? The following sequence of letters describes an interrupted exchange between the representatives of two well-known institutions, whose circles appeared momentarily to intersect only to become tangential shortly thereafter. This transito- ry connection and its textual vestiges - in letters, archival manuscripts, and printed articles - indicates that the original subject of this editorial correspondence was ulti- mately correspondence in and of itself: an epistemological system based on reflection and analogy - two terms that both correspondents exhaustively theorized in their writings yet failed to carry out in their institutional relations. Analogy , correspondence , similarity , likeness , resemblance , and similitude are terms that have been used to describe the survival of premodern mentalities within the heterotopias of mid-nineteenth and twentieth-century modernisms. But likeness produces more likeness, and a similar homology or uncritical automatism informs the literature that attempts to interpret these recurring analogies. In his critique of Baudelaire's "Correspondences," Paul de Man cautions that "[t]he transcen- dence of substitutive, analogical tropes" associated with certain metaphors of like- ness occasionally states their "totalizing power" as they move "from analogy to identity and from simile to symbol and to a higher order of truth."1 Unlike other analogical parallels within the histories of modern art, anthropology, and litera- ture, the following exchange of letters constitutes a form of correspondence between an academic library and a purportedly avant-garde revue that is singular in the history of the two institutions.

"Precisely your research methods provoke my strongest sense of partisanship," Einstein emphasizes, and he indicates that he would be delighted to receive works from the KBW scholars, particularly on the subjects of "the human figure as microcosm, the symbolic representation of bodies, zodiacs and horoscopes." Saxl answered immediately with a two-page letter dated February 2 in which he thanks Einstein particularly for his offer to review the KBW publications in France.4 Saxl underlines the aspiration of the Warburg Library to be "method- ologically relevant outside Germany and to strengthen connections with abroad." Saxl accompanies his response with a copy of Panofsky's Idea and proposes to send the manuscript of a lecture on the theme of "Macrocosm and Microcosm in the Images of the late Middle Ages" - a paper that Saxl had presented "years ago" at the Berlin Society for the Science of Religion - but questions whether it would be too long, warning further that the essay is written for "a public that has a more specialized interest in such documents and subjects." Saxl also accompanies his let- ter with a printed list of KBW publications in which he underlines all works rele- vant to the research topics mentioned by Einstein. 5 The KBW publications appear to have raised Einstein's interest, and in his reply of February 7 he asks for more of them to be sent, including works by Reitzenstein, Cassirer, and Norden (, the latter twoof whose lectures, as Einstein mentions, he had heard during his student days). Again the editor of the Parisian journal underscores the importance of common methodological patterns: "The problem setting that you exhibit in your studies always interested me rather lively, because it goes beyond banal research methods." Einstein asks to read Saxl's manuscript on the microcosm and suggests that if the entire work is too long, the editors of Documents could perhaps select a piece for publication. "An article for us can be four or five printed pages with three pages of images"; Einstein requests that Saxl let him know until what date he should wait for his contribution so that he might reserve a space. Saxl's reply came only two weeks later, and was significantly shorter than his first letter. It was also less congenial, especially with regard to Einstein's solicita- tion of articles by KBW members other than Saxl: "Panofsky and I may be one company-firm, but it is not so that I can write his articles for him I have passed your proposal to Panofsky, but I would doubt that he could write this article [on "proportional figures"] in an instant."6 3.

For the third time, Einstein emphasizes the affinity in method: "I have already told you before that I enormously appreciate the methods of your circle and consider them to be very fruitful." And Einstein further promises to review the publications sent by Saxl in detail. Saxl's answer came almost one month later, on March 19, 1929, and was very brief: he had too much work at that moment to put together a manuscript that would be ready for publication.8 But he did finally send a typescript of his entire lecture on "Microcosm and Macrocosm," hoping that the editors of Documents "may perhaps find it possible to publish part of it." Einstein answered five days later to thank Saxl for sending the typescript and promised that as soon as he had read it he could suggest in which form "this important and very interesting work" could be published in Documents .9 After which nothing was heard from either side for nearly seven months. On October 12 of the same year, Saxl, while in London working on a new catalog of illuminated manuscripts from British libraries, sent a note to one of the secretaries of the KBW in Hamburg to write to "a certain Dr. Einstein in Paris" and inquire about the manuscript that he had sent for publication a long time ago.10 On October 18, Fräulein Ehrenberg wrote to Einstein asking if he was still interested in the typescript, otherwise he should return it to Hamburg.11 There is no evidence of a reply or any other indication that Saxl's typescript was ever returned to Hamburg. On October 26, 1929, eight days after the library's letter to Einstein, its founder Aby Warburg died suddenly, perhaps suspending further inquiries from the Hamburg institution. In spite of Einstein's reassurances, Saxl's essay "Microcosm and Macrocosm" was never published in Documents. Instead, Michel Leiris wrote a three-page essay, "Two Microcosmic Figures from the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth Centuries," based (rather freely) on two illustrations from Saxl's recent- ly published catalog of astrological manuscripts from the Middle Ages ( Verzeichnis astrologischer und mythologischer illustrierter Handschriften des lateinischen Mittelalters ), but with no explicit reference to Saxl's 1926 lecture.12 Leiris s cosmologica! essay was pub- 7.

Academy /Avant-Garde Initially, the micro-history of this botched collaboration might serve as an example of how academic art-historical institutions can be tentative in their will- ingness to join forces with publications associated with the literary or artistic avant-garde. However, the terms "academic" and "avant-garde" do not exactly apply to either of these two circles. It is well known that even though Einstein never completed his university studies, he had studied art history and, like a number of modern art and architec- ture critics and historians such as Adolf Behne and Sigfried Giedion, had attend- ed lectures by Heinrich Wölfflin. However, both in his published art historical texts and unpublished aesthetic fragments, Einstein almost never makes any con- crete references to art historians (while he does mention a number of aesthetic philosophers and theorists, such as Hegel, Nietzsche, [Adolf] Hildebrand, and Bergson). Therefore Einstein's correspondence with Saxl and his references to the works of Panofsky, Norden, and Rietzenstein, as well as the "research methods" of the KBW, are precious evidence of his interest in contemporary art-historical, philological, and anthropological scholarship. It is also a fact that when Documents was launched, its general secretary Georges Bataille was working in the Cabinet des Médaillés, a department of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France and one of the oldest museum collections in the country. Additionally, the review's editorial board and list of contributors included established art historians such as the historian of Northern art Frederik Adama van Scheltema and Josef Strzygowsky, professor at the University of Vienna and member of the so-called Vienna school of art history with which the KBW, and Saxl in particular, had an occasionally tense relationship.14 On the other hand, the Warburg Library was not exactly an academic orga- nization, since very few of the scholars in its circle had permanent university positions. Moreover, even if the library was devoted mainly to the study of Renaissance culture, its members approached a number of other periods, disci- plines, and subjects, and had at least some familiarity with what was happening Phil-hist.

Warburg himself dealt with art of the period (which was mainly turn-of-the-century) and had a sizable art collection that included works by contemporary artists such the Expressionist Franz Marc.15 Symptomatically, Warburg's personal correspondence includes a letter written only a few weeks before his death in which the Hamburg art historian contemplates purchasing some lithographs by Picasso.16 But among the larger circle of Warburg scholars, it was precisely Saxl who developed a number of connections to modern art and architecture during his directorship of the Institute, before and after its migration to London in 1933. Saxl's 1938 lecture on "Science and Art in Renaissance Italy," presented the same year at the International Exhibition of Surrealism in London, starts with an unconventional pair of images: Le Corbusier's Villa Stein at Garches, built in 1927 (reproduced from an illustration in Sigfried Giedion's Bauen in Frankreich , first published in 1928) juxtaposed with Salvador Dali's Soft Construction with Boiled Beans of 1936. 17 Indeed, in one of the Renaissance scholar's last lectures, titled "Why Art History?" and delivered in 1948, its broad methodological argu- ments was illustrated by an array of examples ranging from drawings and fres- coes by Rembrandt, Giotto, and Ghirlandaio to paintings by Cézanne and Picasso, as well as a mask of the Baluba tribe from Congo - a constellation of images reminiscent of the assortment of art-historical and ethnographic materi- al unfolding in the pages of Documents .18 In spite, then, of the collapse of their publishing collaboration, Documents and KBW share a number of methodological affinities whose latent existence might elucidate the initial attraction between the two correspondents. Similar to the tentative juxtaposition of the academy and the avant-garde (with which both the Parisian journal and the German art-historical institute maintained promiscu- ous relationships), the two parties appear on opposing sides of a polarity, rather than in direct analogy or unequivocal likeness. It is, nonetheless, the act of "com- pensation" or "balancing" (what Warburg called Ausgleich ), supported by a layer of embedded correspondences, that keeps such a polarity in constant tension, and therefore anxiously alive.19 The same polarizing tension indicates that the corre- spondence between the two circles remains active even if their epistolary exchange was irrevocably terminated. 15.

While Documents appeared seven to eight times per year, the KBW publications, such as the individ- ual studies ( Studien ) or the collection of lectures presented in the library {Vorträge), emerged annually and after years of preparation. All articles published in Documents were rather short - "four or five printed pages," as Einstein mentions in his letter to Saxl, while essays in the KBW Vorträge , such as Panofsky's well-known lecture "Perspective as Symbolic Form," were much lengthier and were expanded by an abundance of footnotes that could often exceed the word count of the main text.20 It becomes apparent then why Saxl (and Panofsky) would be unwilling or unable to conform to Einstein's requests for the fast-paced production of the semi-scholarly synopses that were required for Documents. The two publishing plan- ets had different orbits. The scholarly publication had a much more protracted periodicity. While Einstein's review could reproduce a miniature (microcosmic) image of Warburgian scholarship, it could not afford to follow its temporal (macrocosmic) circulation. Microcosm/ Macrocosm as Image/ Method Such new systemic affinities reopen the question of method , and more specifi- cally the purported methodological analogies between the texts published in Documents and the writings of the KBW scholars, whose studies, as Einstein men- tioned to Saxl, moved "beyond banal research methods." Partly, in this case, the alternative method is in empathetic correspondence with the eccentric subject of investigation, that is, the repertory of unconventional themes that preoccupied the Warburg scholars, such as the symbolism of the human figure, astral animal signs, cosmological diagrams, and horoscopes. These analogical motifs retraced a number of correspondences, not only between humans or animals and the cosmos but also between different mentalities both antique and modern. The very title of Saxl's essay "Microcosm and Macrocosm" was emblematic of the analogical relationship between two different thought pat- terns that corresponded to two diametrically opposite scales of research, namely the microscopic and telescopic perspectives informing the investigations of both the KBW and Documents. Common to both correspondents was, for example, the fascination with the microcosm of marginal, natural, or man-made objects: snakes, hair, draperies, 20.

In both cases, we deal with rudiments of pre- viously fully functioning organs: even having degenerated into marginal acces- sories, such specimens remain menacingly alive despite the limitations of their atrophied extensions. The archaeological project of the KBW was, then, to map and to protract the tumultuous afterlife that such archaic vestiges enjoyed in mod- ern milieus. For Warburg, such peripheral objects were part of an all-encompass- ing epistemological Umfangsbestimmung - the conceptual "definition of a periph- ery" encircling a certain idea, or an entire mentality that in spite of its geometric definition remains open and therefore relatively undefined.21 Out of the microcosmic image comes the microcosm as a methodological model of investigation. For Warburg's well-known motto "The good God hides in details" (following a statement by Jean Paul) extends not only to the "micrologi- cal" research of scholars in the circle of his library but also echoes some of the perhaps less scholarly investigations of the Documents editors, illustrated by the enlarged images of the wings and legs of flies seen through a microscope that graced the pages of one of the Parisian review's last issues.22 Next to the magnifying process of microscopic details characterizing their research methods stands the macrocosmic aspiration of both publishing venues - an impulse manifested by a shared interest in cosmological, astrological, and ethno- logical investigations and by the desire of the two institutions to expand their research across continents. For the KBW, such an impulse was expressed in Saxl's and Warburg's intent to disseminate their methods beyond Germany, in Europe and America, by means of publications, conferences, and exhibitions. This dissemina- tion of scholarly methodology would in fact mirror Warburg's and Saxl's concept of the meandering Wanderstrassen - the wandering pathways of ideas that in their peri- odic migration from Europe to the Orient (and vice versa) follow similar transconti- nental trajectories across distant historical eras.23 Following Warburg's own ethnographic expedition to the American Southwest, his library hosted a number of lectures and conferences - some of them published in its Vortrage - that were based on anthropological and ethno- graphic research and dealt with the origins of ritual and dramatic performance.24 21.

It was, moreover, the ethnographic museum, specifically the Trocadéro, whose decrepit condition was lamented in an article in the review's first issue, which offered a fragmentary image of that world as an exotic yet interiorized periphery.25 For Documents , the "macrocosm" surrounding man's microcosmic figure was not the heavenly firmament that preoccupied Renaissance scholars, but the geographic territory of this earth, especially its reconstituted border. Viewed through the concentric frames of their microscopic methods and macrocosmic aspirations, the two institutions appear to mirror one another. Within the limits of such likeness, the historiographie legacy of the KBW could pose as the unknown prehistory or the aborted origin of Documents. Yet it is precisely this mirror- ing or doubling effect between the two circles that also discloses the imaginary or ide- alist méconnaissance that both triggered and arrested their encounter. Much of this imaginary correspondence was in fact enacted on the level of the image - a series of optical constellations through which the two institutions would appear to communicate. Previous commentators have detected a similar method of organization between the Memory Atlas ( Mnemosyne Atlas) project by Warburg and Saxl (which had in fact originated as an ideographic mapping project)26 and the incongruous mappings of images that appeared in various issues of Documents , such as the assemblages of human and animal legs, bird wings attached to angels in Byzantine icons, or dancers in modern variety-spectacles.27 Beyond optical similarities there is, nonetheless, an essential difference between the illustrating techniques of Documents and the Warburgian Atlas. Warburg's image constellations are structured upon the principle of an essential iconographie continuity - a hidden, serpentine hyperlink that binds two dissimilar figures to a common origin and traces their future variations. In Documents, such con- tinuity is essentially elided by a series of pseudomorphic resemblances, which while they visually rhyme, have no essential affinity in meaning. Iconographie and narrative links appear to be broken via the mechanical reproduction of the photograph as black-and-white illustration. Divorced from their macrocosmic frame, the microcos- mic extensions of human toes and crustacean antennae appear to brandish their inorganic autonomy and allegorical loss of signification. And yet the same epistemo- logica! buoyancy allows them to form what Roger Caillois would have called "adven- turous coherences" among objects and fields that appear prohibitively distant.28 It is precisely such telepathy of and between images that allows Documents' photographic assemblages to correspond with Warburg's Atlas constellations. 25.

It would finally appear in an English translation under the title "Microcosm and Macrocosm in Medieval Pictures" in an edited volume of Saxl's lectures published in 1957, eight years after the art historian's death and more than thirty years after the lecture was first pre- sented. The typescript of the original 1926 lecture - titled "Macrocosm and Microcosm: Persian Astrological Beliefs in the Occidental Middle Ages" ( Makrokosmos und Mikrokosmos: Persischer Sternglaube im abendländischen Mittelalter) and most probably the text sent to Einstein in Paris - is preserved in the archive of the Warburg Institute in two copies and is twenty-one pages long, while Einstein was soliciting a much shorter article.29 Even if there were likely other rea- sons - based less on practical and more on ideological grounds - that prevented Saxl's text from being published in Documents , a close reading of the first issue reveals that Saxl's lecture informed the contents of that volume in its very absence. We will perhaps never fully grasp the cosmological correspondences that underlie this well-orchestrated sequence of texts by Einstein, Leiris, and Bataille in Documents' inaugural issue if we do not recover the content of Saxl's missing lec- ture. However distant these three coeditors may have often been in their opin- ions,30 here they appear more or less united in their stance against the idealist principles associated with Renaissance humanism and Kantian Enlightenment that at least partly - via the study of Panofsky, Cassirer, and the Neo-Kantian aes- thetics of Hermann Cohen - informed Saxl's epistemological agenda.31 The subject of Saxl's 1926 study was the transformation not simply of cosmo- logical beliefs but of the image that converts such theoretical principles into a visu- al symbol, that is, the microcosmic figure of man (including the so-called Vitruvian figure) and its manifold iterations from Greek and Oriental antiquity to the early Renaissance.32 Saxl had in fact written his dissertation on illuminated 29.

While focusing on its Persian origins, Saxl emphasizes that similar versions of this "magical anatomy" can be found in several regions of the world, from the Chinese to the Maoris, who also attribute a number of "demonic" properties to specific body parts. Expanding on these "Asiatic origins," while reiterating an argument first made by Warburg, Saxl points out that Vitruvius's reference to the equal dimensions of the human body was indebted to similar principles found in ancient Oriental texts and later "aestheticized" in Greek and Roman discourses.34 Saxl argues that the reappearance of anthropomorphic concepts of the uni- verse in a number of twelfth-century illuminated manuscripts confirms the fact that medieval writers were familiar with ancient, hermetic, cosmogonie traditions, as evi- denced, for example, by the Christological visions of Hildegard von Bingen that rep resent man in the center of the heavenly sphere, outstretched arms and feet touch- Layout from " Microcosm and Macrocosm in Mediaeval Pictures " by Fritz Saxl 1957.

Saxl argues, however, that during the two hundred years between the thir- teenth and fifteenth centuries, ancient cosmology experienced a transforming "revival in theory and practice." What previously had been a merely "illustrative" or "metaphorical" use of images gradually led to an acceptance of their ancient mean- ing, as well as their inclusion in official practices performed by the state and the church: "The step from a metaphorical use to the practical application of the images is not the sign of a new superstition but an example of regressive evolution."36 For Saxl, the Renaissance took a step backwards in order to move ahead: it regressed into ancient cosmological interpretation to discover a rational cosmic order, one that granted a central place to the human individual and led to the creation of the mod- ern subject (which truly emerges a century later in the philosophy of Descartes).37 One can trace this epistemological transition in Leonardo's well-known Vitruvian man, which, according to Saxl, no longer reflects the influence of cosmo- logical speculation but rather appropriates the combination of empirical observation and scientific reasoning. Leonardo's project is both anthropocentric and anthropo- metric; it is based on measurement and numerical proportion instead of abstract medieval influences. At the close of his lecture, Saxl juxtaposes Leonardo's Vitruvian Layout from "Microcosm and Macrocosm in Mediaeval Pictures " by Fritz Saxl. 1957. Courtesy WIA, London. 35.

For Dürer, Saxl writes, the Saturnian "Melancholy is a symbol of the individual mind looking for its own image in the mirror of the universe," while for Leonardo the Vitruvian figure serves as a model of "the mind" that "acquiesces" in the world of external objects by recognizing "its own principle of inherent regularity."38 In other words, Dürer is inclined towards self-reflective allegory, while Leonardo reaffirms the body as a symbol with a quantifi- able presence within the realm of science and the natural world. One may place Saxl's 1926 lecture "Microcosm and Macrocosm" among a num- ber of interwar European philosophical discourses questioning (and reaffirming) the centrality of the human subject following a global anthropological perspective. And here one may discover a number of "correspondences" as well as disparities with the texts by Leiris and Einstein that were published in Documents perhaps en lieu of Saxl's. In his "Notes sur deux figures microcosmiques des ХГУе et XVe siècles," extract- ed from Saxl's catalog of illuminated medieval manuscripts, for example, Leiris, reads such figures as remnants of an "anthropomorphic phase" of the world, a stage in which man lives in "harmony" with his surroundings and "fraternizes" with nature. While "far from equal," man appears to be "parallel" to all natural forces.39 Similar to Saxl, Leiris describes the correspondences between specific body parts and the uni- verse, quoting from the study of ancient syncretism in Iranian and Greek cultures by Reitzenstein (whose name Einstein had repeatedly mentioned in his correspondence with Saxl and whose book, published by the KBW, included a number of the same illustrations as those in Saxl's catalog).40 While describing a microcosmic figure from Saxl's Verzeichnis , Leiris observes that here man appears as a "prisoner" (prisonnier) of his own influences: his figure is traversed by the intersecting lines of the seven plan- ets and the twelve divisions of the zodiac circle.

Unlike the Vitruvian canon, the cosmic analogies traced by Leiris are neither inescapable nor entirely fixed. While emphasizing the archaic cabalistic origins of such images, Leiris, like Saxl, in fact closes his article with a reference to Leonardo's Vitruvian figure and laments the fact that its symbolic origins have been reduced to a number of "aes- thetic" principles, such as the "canon of Polyclitus" or the "golden section," which were in fact experiencing a revival in aesthetics and academic art theory during the interwar period in France.42 Yet at the same time, the primitive symbolic sys- tems of signification that had generated such proportional principles had been forgotten. Far from facilitating free-floating analogies, such aesthetic norms con- solidated inflexible homologies with one and the same object, ratio, or ideological position. The "harmony" of the ancient world and the mobility of its analogical mentality were frozen into a set of static "principles" reifying academic canons. And here lies an essential difference between Leiris's view of the modern micro- cosmic figure and Saxl's conclusions on the same proportional figures: for even if the Warburg scholar had also lamented the "aesthetization" of such ideas, he hailed their "rationalization" in the scientific culture of the Renaissance as an inevitable step towards enlightenment, something that Leiris, and even more emphatically Einstein and Bataille, would challenge. Animisms /Fetishisms Indeed the rift (as well as the ineffable correspondence) between KBW and Documents becomes even more palpable in the two articles by Einstein that precede Leiris's commentary. In his "Methodological Aphorisms," Einstein declares that "in the era of the Renaissance, the macrocosm corresponded ( concordait ) to the micro- cosm" - a statement that echoes both Saxl and Leiris. And yet such "concordance" is not an axiomatic or eternal law, but a volatile reflection cast by inner impulses: "a sort of naturalism of the canon and of the archetype-inspired belief because psychological processes seemed to correspond to processes of nature."43 Einstein too protests even more strongly against the reduction of such harmonious analogies into a "canon" 41.

Only the mobilization of such reified analogies and the acceptance of their "halluci- natory" aspect can ultimately "swindle" man from "monotonous continuity."45 Such mobilizing "continuities" would in fact reappear in Einstein's next article on "Some Paintings of 1928" by Picasso - a brief text that initially seems to have noth- ing to do with cosmological concepts, but if read carefully, reveals a number of analo- gies with Einstein's previous article and with the cosmological speculations articulat- ed by Leiris in his reflections on Saxl's medieval image catalogs. In his remarks on Picasso, Einstein repeatedly refers to analogies, and more specifically "a certain conti- nuity of analogous forms" re-created in the artist's paintings by a "multiplicity" of fig- ures and compositional axes.46 Moving away from the "tautological" repetition of Page from Documents 1, no. 1. 1929. 44.

Signaling the end of "the con- vention of the vertebral column" and the establishment of a more complex "equilib- rium of different axes," Picasso introduces a "surface polyphony" - a quasi-cosmologi- cal system or "force field ( champ des forces )" with multiple indications of the subject in space. Figures and architectural interiors are entirely remodeled by a new set of ana- logical relationships expressed as "formal radiations."47 Since for Einstein "all parts are given from the analogies of the total com- position," man and the proportions of his body are no longer the center of the recombined universe; the human figure is simply an equal member among a community of forms, including those of so-called inanimate objects. Within this new analogical universe, all forms communicate with one another from a distance - what Einstein describes as "telepathy of the analogous imaginary forms" - a macrocosmic influence between subjects and objects based on the multiplication and variation of their plastic contours.48 In Picasso's pictures, all outlines are left free to reconstitute a new halluci- natory reality that escapes "biological conservatism" and creates a new "mythol- ogy of forms" within a thoroughly "invented" composition. Proportions are entirely reconstituted; bodily parts still act as fulcrums of analogical relations, but also as diagonal epistemological correspondences, tracing new connections both with the world and with the self. There is no microcosm or macrocosm proper: it is impossible to redefine objects in scale or place them in any type of hierarchical order. Everything is connected to a "linear calligram " with no per- ceptible periphery or symmetry axis. The nonhierarchical cosmos encompass- ing such boundless analogies is the interiorized world of the artist's studio and in extension the surface of his canvas. As opposed to the Renaissance's "scientific fetishism"49 (the overvaluation of a singular object or figurai principle), Einstein's epistemological paradigm inspired by Picasso points to a "diffused animism"50: a state in which all objects share an equal value based on their analogical capacity, meaning their ability to connect and become interchangeable with one another. The same animat- ing force energizes every member of the social circuitry of forms in Picasso's composition. The painting becomes a field of ontological equanimity - a tec- tonic microcosm animated by equivalent possibilities of existence. If we accept the hypothesis of Saxl's covert influence on Einstein's article, then the latter's commentary on Picasso is one of the rare instances in which the cosmological principles of the Renaissance correspond (both in harmony and dissonance) 47.

The common task of both the KBW and Documents , in spite of their differences, was to study not simply the survival but the renewal and active transformation of ancient analogical or animistic beliefs within the recombined spaces of modernity. The purpose of such an epistemological ves- tige is not to conserve an archaic mentality but to propel a modern one. Notwithstanding such common ulterior motives, at a certain point, the two cor- responding circles appear to have parted ways, reducing their preexisting analogies into a polarity of diametrically different opinions vis-à-vis the signifi- cance of the Renaissance era. If for Einstein the Renaissance represented the hallucinatory illusion of "biological conservatism," for KBW scholars such as Saxl and in particular Panofsky, the "scientific" discoveries of the Renaissance, such as the invention of perspective and use of mathematical proportion, achieved "the objectification of the subjective" - the rationalization of psycho- logical tendencies into an intersubjective principle. This fundamental diver- gence of opinion might be the more essential reason why Panofsky could never find any time to write for Documents and why the purported collaboration between the Warburg scholars and the editors of the French review never pro- gressed beyond its first issue. It seems finally that the planets of the KBW and Documents not only had dif- ferent orbits, but were in fact stars from distant galaxies that only accidentally produced a mirage-like constellation. However, the same momentary coinci- dence produced a symptomatic eclipse, its aftermath ultimately illuminating connections of modern historiographies of art with the histories of epistemolog- ical systems, including the associative patterns of analogical mentality - an ancient mode of thinking that art history, a discipline originally founded upon the notions of similarity and resemblance, would inevitably return to, either via the composite ethnography of Documents or the anthropological investigations of the Warburg Library. Postscript: Gifts /Horses The KBW never had a subscription to Documents. However, in addition to an offprint of the article by Leiris on the two images from Saxl's catalog, there are two more offprints that have become part of the holdings of the library and can 51.

Both offprints are of articles written by Bataille, the "general secretary" of Documents , and refer to ancient numismatics, namely "The Academic Horse" (Le cheval académique) and "Base Materialism and Gnosticism" (Le bas matérialisme et la gnose). 52 The two texts, published in the first issues of 1929 and 1930, respectively, carry perhaps the core of Bataille's evolutionary argument on their (horse) backs. Both articles make a plea for hybridity - the corruption of a previously idealized academic form such as that of the horse or the human figure into a grotesque creature that resembles a "spider," a "hippopotamus," or a "bird- headed" human. Such formal atavisms were certainly not unknown to Warburg and the scholars of his circle, who often studied a variety of "animal-human" or other monstrous representations from Egyptian, medieval, and Northern Renaissance iconographies. Warburg and Saxl would also often refer to the con- 52.

But this quasi-utilitarian view of deforma- tion is not the one supported by Bataille. The French author describes a form of regression that grows haphazardly with time, a devolution that moves for- ward and entirely dismantles the culture of the "vertical vertebrae," forcing an animal or cultural process to return to point zero or move in entirely unpre- dictable directions. We do not know how these offprints from Documents became part of the Warburg Library. Yet we can imagine the reactions of some of its scholars when (or if) they read them. Bataille's "base materialism," which stripped all formerly "academic" figures and their cosmic correspondences from any notion of ideal perfection and other Neoplatonist accoutrements, might have appeared shock- ing to some of the scholars in the Warburg circle, who were also intrigued by the same animalic images. One can perhaps understand, then, why a book such as Panofsky's Idea , sent as a "gift" to Einstein, did not in fact appeal to the art critic, and why he asked Saxl for further publications by Norden, Cassirer, and Reitzenstein that reached further back to more "symbolic" and less idealist ana- logical systems.55 The texts offered in return by Einstein, Leiris, and Bataille in the first issue of Documents were more ambivalent: the offprint of Bataille's "academic horse" was essentially a Trojan horse aimed to destroy the territory in which it had entered. One could perhaps expand the Trojan attributes of this gift exchange into the mutually deforming impact of the academy's interaction with the avant-garde. But here the academy, and not the avant-garde, is the unruly element that can create havoc with its galloping backwards. To ride the "academic horse," one has to ride by its rules or else turn over the reins and be prepared to be trampled. 53.

Einstein's original proposal to the KBW was part of that broken analogical circle - the residue of an impetus for correspondence and affiliation. But such a drive does not always reach its aim. Ultimately the two corresponding parties were either too distant or too close, thus there was no viable space for the network of analogy to grow beyond their individual circles.56 56. On January 4th, 1933, almost four years after his first epistolary exchange with Saxl, Einstein sent a letter to Panofsky in response to a "kind piece of writing" sent by Panofsky some time earlier. In the letter, Einstein expresses his sympathy with methodological tendencies in the work of Panofsky and his "friends," whom Einstein praises as "currently quite important." Einstein admits that he does not yet know Panofsky 's works, but now that he has some time he can familiarize himself with them. He parenthetically mentions that he urgently needs to read Saxl's recent book on Mithras as soon as he can get hold of a copy (Fritz Saxl, Mithras: Typengeschichtliche Untersuchungen, [Berlin: Keller, 1931]). Einstein offers (in return) to send copies of his own publications, including his Art of the Twentieth Century as well as the brochure from an exhibition on early antique bronzes published two years earlier in the United States (Carl Einstein, "Exhibition of Bronze Statuettes B.C." [New York: Storia Art Galleries, 1931]). Einstein also promises to send the following week a "thick manuscript" for Panofsky's perusal. He closes his letter with greetings to both Panofsky and Saxl hoping that they will all stay in contact. Panofsky's diplomatic yet highly evasive response came two days later: he would be happy to read Einstein's writings but he is about to depart for America in a few days and therefore advises send- ing the manuscript directly to Professor Saxl at the KBW. If the occasion is not very urgent, Panofsky continues, and Einstein could stand the delay, he would be delighted to read the manuscript upon returning to Germany five months hence. Panofsky forwarded Einstein's letter and his own reply to the KBW and asked Saxl to take note. There is however no mention of Einstein in Saxl's subsequent corre- spondence with Panofsky during the latter's 1933 trip to the States and no trace of further correspon- dence between Einstein and Panofsky.
