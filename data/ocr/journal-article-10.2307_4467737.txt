<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mordecai Kaplan and Ralph Waldo Emerson: A Theology of the Individual Mel Scult want to talk about Mordecai M. Kaplan's theology. Some might say that such an expression is an oxymoron. I think not. Kaplan, like his teacher Ralph Waldo Emerson, suffers from not being taken seriously as a philosopher. Perhaps he was more the sociologist than the theologian. Yet sometimes the sociologist becomes the theo- logian and can be very provocative. I wish to maintain that there is another Kaplan, not Kaplan the so- ciological theologian, the follower of William James andJohn Dewey, but Kaplan the reader/follower of Emerson. In his more mature thinking, Kaplan moves toward a greater emphasis on the individual that is clearly Emersonian. Additionally, we find that Kaplan's concept of the transnatural bears a striking similarity to Emerson's "Oversoul." Kaplan has always been credited by his supporters and his critics for asking the right questions. Hugo Bergman, professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University in the 1930s and certainly no partisan of Kap- lan's, once gave him a rather backhanded compliment focusing on Kaplan's ability to ask the right questions. Kaplan was in Palestine teaching at the Hebrew University. His latest book, Judaism in Transi- Mel Scult, "Mordecai Kaplan and Ralph Waldo Emerson: A Theology of the Individual," Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society n.s. 12, no. 2 (Winter 2006): 99-114</page><page sequence="2">tion, had just appeared. Writing in Ha-arets in September 1936, Berg- man states: Kaplan dared ask ofJudaism questions which we are accustomed to pass over in silence and he tried to answer them according to his viewpoint without prejudice, without fear and with relentless consistency. In this he has rendered religious Judaism a great service.... His books are of the category of those whose errors are more important than the truths one finds in many books by others. Kaplan then adds in his diary, "I never anticipated such praise from one who is a follower of Buber."' Kaplan was the evolving religiousJew who continually searched for the right formulation. He enjoyed formulation as any good thinker does, and he formulated and reformulated, but his movements are subtle and in many cases they are lateral rather than linear. He was ad- dicted to formulation and, in fact, was aware of his addiction and re- gretted not being more of an activist. Once in the late 1920s he had the idea that he should write the diary in the third person. For a few weeks he tried it but then reverted back to ordinary diary style. The entries for this limited period are quite enlightening. For example, he wrote the following about himself: "He had a weakness for formulas. Never having had the fortune of experiencing the thrill of first-hand contact with things, he lived in a universe of words."2 Kaplan's theology is complicated and multilayered, but I believe that the place of the individual holds the key to understanding his the- ology. We think of him as the advocate of 'Judaism as a Civilization"- the community, the Center, the collective consciousness. All of these are central. But, in fact, the individual and individual fulfillment are the linchpins that hold the whole structure together. Let me put it another way. There are several voices in his head, voices that are quite disparate. There is Ahad Ha-am and Emerson, Dewey and Henri Bergson. These advocates of the collective and the individual were all held in creative tension by Kaplan throughout his life. I would also propose what might be called a theology of mood. Kaplan moves back and forth, sometimes with Ahad Ha-am, some- times with Emerson, sometimes with a synthesis that resides with Dewey. But always provocatively. The tensions I am describing emerge most prominently in Kaplan's views on democracy and in his theology. For the young Kaplan, de- mocracy seemed more a threat than an opportunity. The Goldene Me- dina (golden land) meant that Jews were free not to be Jews. Out of concern for the future of the Jewish people, Kaplan advocated an [100] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="3">Ahad Ha-amian Judaism that saw in the collective consciousness and its strengthening the key to Jewish survival. When the collective is strong, however, the freedom of the individual suffers. Early in his ca- reer, Kaplan was ready to accept such limitations as the price of sur- vival. He believed that democracy and freedom had to be limited if there were to be any kind of real community amongJews. Traditional societies exert strong pressures on individual members because the collective will is so clear and united. In fact, in 1919 he was quite far from the democratic individualism that he later proclaimed: Throughout the centuries, wherever the Jews were scattered, they lived in communities that were able to a large extent to enforce their will upon the individual. IfJudaism is on the wane it is because there is no possibility of resorting to the collective mind or the collective will, thus showing that theJewish people are disintegrating.3 It is clear that a strengthened kehilah (Jewish community organiza- tion) was his model. There had to be a way to exert social pressure so that the community and its values could remain intact. Such thoughts about community coercion surface throughout Kaplan's writings. He admired the Catholic Church's cohesiveness and unity, which helped it to withstand the disintegrating forces of secularization in the mod- ern period. Indeed, he sometimes felt that the Church could serve as a model for the Jewish community. In Judaism as a Civilization, he pro- claimed "[W]eJews should strive to achieve a community status which is analogous to that of the Catholic Church."4 Yet from the beginning there are gaps and weaknesses in Kaplan's dedication to the collective and to his teacher Ahad Ha-am. There are other voices. Although Ahad Ha-am is foundational, Kaplan was never the uncritical disciple. In 1909 he wrote to a rabbinical colleague Phin- eas Israeli that "His [Ahad Ha-am's] nationality is a barren unproduc- tive idea" that lacked "religious significance."5 Ahad Ha-am's secularism grated on Kaplan's religious sensibilities. His critical attitude toward Ahad Ha-am also emerges in connection with Samson Benderly, who was Kaplan's close friend and confidant as well as a loyal disciple of Ahad Ha-am. Yet Kaplan makes it clear that he resented Benderly's secularism and his lack of appreciation for the synagogue as an agent ofJewish survival. In Judaism as a Civilization, Kaplan went beyond his early criticism and focused on Ahad Ha-am's lack of appreciation for the individual. For Kaplan, the fulfillment of the individual was emerging as primary for any solution to the problems of Jewish life. "It is reactionary," he [101] Kaplan and Emerson Mel Scult Mel Scult</page><page sequence="4">said, commenting on Ahad Ha-am, "to ask the individual to sink back into his former subservience [to the group]."6 Kaplan's major theological work, The Meaning of God in ModernJew- ish Religion, published in 1937, has at its center the well-known formu- lation "God as the power that makes for salvation." Kaplan has often been criticized for his use of the term salvation; many thought it Chris- tian rather than Jewish. Max Kadushin objected to this formulation when I interviewed him about Kaplan.7 Salvation was not a primary rabbinic term Kadushin maintained. Nonetheless, Kaplan believed the term could be used in any period to indicate the ultimate goal of religion. Of course, salvation changed its meaning in different periods. In his historical works, Kaplan showed how the term moved from the otherworldly sense in the Middle Ages to the this-worldly sense of the modern period. In a post- Enlightenment world, salvation is a this-worldly phenomenon. Understanding Kaplan's theology and his reinterpretation of salva- tion means to see him within his American context, within the broad outlines of religion in America. We all know that religion in America means Emerson. As Ahlstrom has put it, "Emerson is in fact the theo- logian of something we may almost term 'the American Religion.'"8 Kaplan and Emerson? At first glance, an unlikely pair, a very odd couple:Jew and Christian; rationalist and near mystic; one devoted to peoplehood, the other elevating the individual to divine status. They seem divergent in the extreme. And yet, if the truth be told, Kaplan not only appreciated Emerson but used him freely. I happened on the Kaplan-Emerson connection purely by accident while studying Kaplan's diary. It was the summer of 1942, and he was preparing the prayer book that would come out in 1945. (It was this prayer book that led to Kaplan's excommunication.)9 During that summer, he finally decided to take seriously a piece of advice he had given many years before to one of his students, Louis Finkelstein. To create liturgy, he had told Finkelstein in the early 1920s, you must take a theological essay and turn it into a prayer. He did this in the summer of 1942 with essays by Leo Baeck, AbrahamJoshua Heschel, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.'l Heschel and Emerson-what a strange combina- tion! Yet they exist together in Kaplan's diary and in an early draft of his siddur.11 This fact certainly illustrates the pluralistic nature of his mind. Heschel and Baeck made it into the 1945 prayer book; Emerson did not. It should be noted, however, that at the Society for the Ad- vancement ofJudaism before the 1945 prayer book appeared, Kaplan had instituted a looseleaf prayer book, perhaps the perfect metaphor for his attitude toward the liturgy-a core of prayers to which the con- [102] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="5">gregation could add or subtract. In the looseleaf prayer book, Emer- son and Heschel existed side by side.l2 The Emerson essay Kaplan used for constructing his prayer was written in the late 1830s, when Emerson was at the height of his cre- ative powers. Born in 1803 and educated at Harvard, he had been ap- pointed minister of the Second Church of Boston but left in 1832 because of his conviction that he could no longer administer com- munion. Leaving the post of minister was but one manifestation of Emerson's growing belief in the sacredness of the individual and his rebellion against any form of organized religion. Perhaps it was this re- bellion that attracted Kaplan. Emerson always emphasized that religion was a present experience -not past tradition-and he was drawn away from any supernatural understanding of Christianity. The prayer that Kaplan composed re- flects the individualism at the center of Emerson's philosophy as well as an anti-tradition, anti-establishment bias. The basis for this prayer is Emerson's essay, "The Address Delivered Before the Senior Class in Di- vinity, Cambridge, Sunday evening,July 15,1838." The language here is Emerson's but the prayer (including the title) is Kaplan's: NEEDED PROPHETS FOR OUR DAY by Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan in the name of Ralph Waldo Emerson He who makes me aware that I am an infinite soul heartens me. He who gives me to myself lifts me. He who shows God in me fortifies me. He who hides God from me destroys the reason for my being. The divine prophets, bards and lawgivers are friends of my virtue, of my intellect, of my strength. Noble provocations go out from them, inviting me to resist evil. But let us not speak of revelations as something long ago given and done. Only by coming to the God in ourselves can we grow forevermore. Let us not say that the age of inspiration is past, that the Bible is closed. Let us learn to believe in the soul of man, and not merely in men departed. The need was never greater of new revelations than now. The faith of man has suffered universal decay. The heart moans, because it is bereaved of consolation and hope and grandeur. We feel defrauded and disconsolate. Our religion has become spectral. [103] Kaplan and Emerson Mel Scult Mel Scult</page><page sequence="6">It has lost its grasp on the affection of the good and on the fear of the bad. What greater calamity can befall a nation than the loss of worship? Then all things go to decay. Genius leaves the Temple. Literature becomes frivolous. Science is cold. The eye of youth is not lighted by hope of a better world. Society lives for trifles. In the soul let redemption be sought. Let the keepers of religion show us that God is, not was. That He speaketh, not spoke. And thus cheer our fainting hearts with new hope and new revelation. Since I discovered this prayer in Kaplan's diary a number of years ago, I have been knee-deep in Emerson. Kaplan tells us that we ought to pray from Emerson regularly in the Sabbath Musaf service.13 Such an assertion constitutes a significant theological statement, challeng- ing my previous understanding of his theology. We might say that Emerson was a part of Kaplan's subconscious. As one Emerson scholar has put it, "[R]eading is a form of self-recovery. We discover in our reading portions of our self that would otherwise have remained subliminal."'4 The Emerson-Kaplan prayer as well as the Heschel prayer are retrievals of lost parts of Kaplan. Or, to put the thought in Emerson's language, "Other men are lenses through which we read our own minds."15 There are hints of Emerson in Kaplan's writing from the beginning. For example, in the first paragraph of the diary, in 1913, Kaplan was preparing a series of talks to Menorah Societies and was going first to Harvard. He recorded the notes for his talk: Religion is primarily a social phenomenon. To grasp its reality, to observe its workings and to further its growth we must study its functioning in some social group. The individual and his development or perfection may constitute the sole aim of religion, but the fact and substance of reli- gion cannot exist completely and exhaustively in an individual.16 In a sense, my article is a meditation on this passage. If we read Kap- lan and think Ahad Ha-am and Emile Durkheim, we will come out in one place with Kaplan the sociologist. If we think Emerson, we come out in another. One might say that Kaplan is often "speaking" Emer- son but is barely aware of it. He states here what, in Emerson, has been called "self-culture." The individual and his perfection, Kaplan be- lieves, is the goal of group life. We might call it Bildung, because for Emerson this truth is inherited from his teacher Goethe. Reading [104] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="7">Kaplan carefully will yield a religion of the individual perfectly com- patible with his emphasis onJewish peoplehood. The group is never the end of our struggle; it is only the means to survival. But once we have finished speaking about survival, we must ask, "Survival for what?" And this brings us back to the self and to the religion of the individual. "The individual and his development or per- fection may constitute the sole aim of religion," Kaplan asserts in this passage, though of course he believes that religion only functions within the group. Emerson never emphasizes the group as much as his disciples do. Nonetheless, we see that Kaplan's theology bears a strik- ing resemblance to Emersonian transcendentalism though it is only completed through Kaplan's appropriation of Dewey.'7 To complete the circle, we must remember that for Dewey the group exists for the benefit of each individual in it. There are times when the connections between Kaplan and Emer- son are clear and overwhelming. In a fascinating diary passage written during World War II, Kaplan is thinking about the evils of fascism and the way that individuals are drawn by societal pressures toward evils they are not always fully aware of. Only an inner freedom can save the individual when the multitude is bent on mischief. Kaplan's mind is then drawn naturally to Exodus 23:2, "Thou shalt not follow a multi- tude to do evil." But in interpreting the verse he thinks immediately of Emerson and quotes the famous line from "Self Reliance" that "Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of its members." "In- ner freedom," Kaplan continues, "is only the nay of which the yea spells truth, justice and peace. In saying nay to brute force in all its manifestations man qualifies himself for partnership with God to build the city of God."18 Thus, the divine lies in the individual's courage to transcend his fears and to stand against the pressures of his society-in short, to stand for the transcendent. For Kaplan, Emerson sometimes served as the "holy" text that pre- cisely expressed what he was thinking-or, to put it another way, what he might be thinking about a situation when a statement from Emer- son would pop into his mind. In 1943, for example, Kaplan was read- ing about the Battle of France a few years before and was deeply impressed by the bravery of the French. The vital spirit expressed in the heroism of the French reminded him of a passage from Emerson about the individual, which he then inserted into his journal. The truth of the matter is that the passage Kaplan quotes at this point is rather unrelated to heroism, but it is related to vitality-a central no- tion in Kaplan's system: [105] Kaplan and Emerson Mel Scult</page><page sequence="8">Consider that the perpetual admonition of Nature to us is[:] The world is new, untried. Do not believe the past. I give you the universe new and un- handled every hour ... In your sane hour you shall see that not a line has yet been written ... It remains for you; so does all thought, all object, all life remains unwritten still.'9 Emerson's call to renewal illustrated for Kaplan the ever-present poten- tial to remake ourselves. Let us return for a moment to Kaplan's seminal work The Meaning of God. This work is built around the central theological formulation of "God as the power that makes for Salvation." Kaplan has always been much more interested in salvation than in God. I am not sure that Mil- ton Steinberg, Kaplan's primary critic on the metaphysical issue, under- stood this. Kaplan is continually searching for a proper formulation. Salvation, he says, as if to quote Dewey (his other rebbe who serves as a corrective to Emerson), means growth. Salvation, Kaplan often states, means to become fully human. It means in a very pragmatic way to become fully effective. This is again to assert the ideal of individual perfection we noted above and to embrace democracy as Emerson and Dewey understood it. Stephen Rockefeller, one of Dewey's most articulate contemporary disciples, puts it this way: "His [Dewey's] concept of growth is one of the big unifying ideas in his evolutionary philosophy of human nature and society. It ties his theory of the moral life to- gether with his psychology, theory of education, and social thought."20 In a manuscript from the 1950s, Kaplan summed up his ideology of the self this way: "Salvation is redemption from those evils within and outside man which hinder man from becoming fully human, or which obstruct his urge to self metamorphosis [self-transcendence]. Salva- tion is unhampered freedom in living and helping others to live a cou- rageous, intelligent, righteous and purposeful life."21 This statement comes from an unpublished work Kaplan called "Soterics." Throughout the 1940s, Kaplan wrote much about creating a scientific schema of religion that he called soterics, from the Greek word soter, to save-a scientific theory of salvation, a pragmatic meta- physics, if you will. Over the years I have found fragments in English of that work among his papers. It was apparently translated in the 1950s and appears under the title Ha-emunah veha-musar (Belief and Ethics). On the first page, we find a striking quotation through which Kaplan would have us understand the direction of his theology. It directs us from the individual to the divine. The quotation is from Joseph Albo, a medieval philosopher, who was quoting Al Gazzali, whose thought, of course, goes back to Aristotle and Plato. The statement Kaplan [106] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="9">quotes is "Da et nafshekha ve-teda et borekha"-"know your soul [self] and you will come to know your creator." The self, in other words, is the key to the divine. We could not get more Emersonian than this.22 But there is more. I would like to advocate that Kaplan, without say- ing as much, seems also to embrace Emerson's concept of the Over- soul. Kaplan writes endlessly about the way in which the belief in God functions but less about God's essence. "It is because God is to me the warm personal element in life's inner urge to creativity and self- expression that I can conscientiously employ the name YH W H when praying." Or again, "God is that aspect of reality which elicits from us the best that is in us and enables us to bear the worst that can befall us." Or again, "God is the assumption that there is enough in the world to meet men's needs but not their greeds for power and pleasure."23 This last formulation, by the way, was the one that was on his mind when I met him in 1972. All of these formulations give us Kaplan the immanentist, the soci- ologist telling us the way that the belief in God functions-Kaplan the man of predicate theology. The question is whether that is all there is: God as the sum of ideals; a Durkheimian god whose existence ends where society and humanity end; or, is there a concept of God over and above his identification with the world? To put it another way, is Kaplan merely a naturalist or does he go beyond naturalism? Kaplan has given us the rather cumbersome term transnatural, and we must try to disambiguate it. The transnatural is the realm between the natural and the supernatural. I would like to suggest that the realm of the transnatural has much in common with Emerson's Oversoul. First of all, there are many instances both early and late in his career when Kaplan denies that he is merely the naturalist. The most striking occurs early in the diary entry for March 30, 1913, where he states that "The moment God is merely identified with the world and conceived as a being immanent but not transcendent, His divinity is denied and He is dissolved into the world. This is the atheism and pantheism which religion so vigorously contends against."24 Although Kaplan's system has much in common with humanism, especially as it was ex- pressed in the Humanist Manifesto of 1931,25 he vehemently and explicitly condemns a "Godless humanism." In "Soterics," we find Kaplan the so-called "naturalist" condemning a life without God. "A godless humanism," he states, "is all too likely to degenerate into a re- ligion of power in which man aspires to the throne of God."26 There are so many that accuse him of secularizing religion but it is obvious here that Kaplan sees himself as theologizing secularism. Kaplan was often misunderstood on this central theological point [107] Kaplan and Emerson Mel Scult</page><page sequence="10">of the immanent and the transcendent. A chance encounter with Mar- tin Buber illustrates the misunderstanding. This event, or "life-text," occurred in the mid-1930s when Kaplan was in Jerusalem. The ac- count comes from Kaplan's diary entry forJuly 9, 1938: As I waited for the bus which would take me to the University Buber came up. This time I decided not to be the one who begins the conversation, as I have been on all the occasions I have met him. He has never asked me anything about myself and I had to goad him into a conversation. But after two or three minutes he began by saying that these days he is reading my book, The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion. In the meanwhile the bus came and from that moment on, throughout our ride we con- versed about the idea of God in my book. He expressed his objection to my approach and said that my god is not a god, because he is entirely im- manent. The God of the simple Polish Jew is the God of Israel and the God of the universe. I tried to show him that I devote an entire chapter to the idea that God is a force outside of ourselves. He responded that this idea does not appear as central, but I think that he has not yet gotten to that chapter in my book. He promised me that he would write a review of my book in the form of a letter addressed to me. I cannot say that we thoroughly enjoyed the conversation, but the fact that, at least, Buber behaved himself humanly, taking into consideration the interests of his colleague, pacified me somewhat. It was not only Buber who misunderstood Kaplan but Kaplan's stu- dents as well. Repeatedly throughout the years, it became clear that the students just did not get the point. Or perhaps Kaplan never com- pletely clarified this major theological issue. His mode of thinking could easily mislead. InJudaism as a Civilization, for example, he almost always discusses "the idea of God" rather than God. Kaplan was continually frustrated by this problem of the seeming inability of his students and others to understand that he was not advo- cating a kind of Jewish naturalist humanism. Witness the report of a class discussion with his rabbinical students at the Jewish Theological Seminary on January 29, 1935, as described in his diary on that date: How little the Seminary authorities have any idea of the religious unrest among the very men who are studying for the rabbinate! Could they imag- ine for a moment that in a class at the Seminary there could go on the kind of discussion that went on during the hour in Homiletics this after- noon. In discussing the outline I had given them on "Humanism is not enough" I was bombarded with questions as to why I insist upon retaining the name of God in the ethical pattern of thought. The usual arguments [108] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="11">about the misconceptions in the minds of those who hear it used were ad- vanced with a great deal of clarity and force by the best men in the class. In answer to the argument that by using the term God I've only re- enforced the anthropomorphic conception in people's minds, I made the point that what I am urging is not merely that the name God be re- tained, but that we center all our efforts upon educating the people to put new content into that name. That is at present our main function as reli- gious teachers. In answer to the argument that some of the most worthwhile people are alienated fromJewish life and ethical endeavor alongJewish lines be- cause we insist upon using the name of God I replied, first, they are alien- ated because we do not engage frankly in the task of putting new content into the term God, and secondly it is not the use of the term God that re- pels them but rather the whole nexus of legends which most of our people insist upon teaching as factual and historical. In answer to the argument that it is impossible to retain our prayer- book if we are to use the term God in the sense in which I suggested, I said that I hold no brief for the prayerbook. Why not write new prayers in con- formity with the modern conception of God? Why have a prayerbook at all? Why not prayers which can be used at the discretion and in accor- dance with actually felt needs? The above text and the Buber encounter clearly indicate Kaplan's insistence that the concept of God was not to be reduced to a synonym for our highest ideals but was to be understood unquestionably as an objective reality transcending human subjectivity. Hence the direction of the "new content" he continued to advocate. Witness another confrontation in 1943. Four of Kaplan's rabbinical students come to him.27 They were entering the pardes, one might say.28 Can they serve as rabbis without believing in God, they want to know. One can almost hear Kaplan pounding on the desk, "You just don't get the point." Here is the passage from his diary entry for March 19, 1943: The purpose of their visit was to air their inner conflicts. They find it dif- ficult to believe in God and yet they want to serve the Jewish people. Can they conscientiously do so as rabbis? They had of course long ago given up the traditional basis for the belief in the existence of God, namely, revela- tion. But they have so far found no substitute. What I have been teaching as the alternative to the traditional basis for the belief in God does not convince them. I evidently have not succeeded in communicating to them my own experience of a transcendent correlative to man's will to sal- vation. They admit the existence of a will to salvation, but they see no need for positing a transcendent correlative of that will. Of course, my contention is not that I intellectually posit it, but that I experience it with [109] Kaplan and Emerson Mel Scult</page><page sequence="12">the same immediacy as I do my own self. Intellectually I cannot posit the existence of a self, for the little I know of psychology tells me that the self is an illusion. Yet if I were to deny the reality of the existence of self as a center of initiative I would cut the ground from under the element of re- sponsibility, without which human life is inconceivable. The same holds true of otherhood with its element of loyalty and of godhood with its ele- ment of piety ... The main question which they must answer for themselves is this: Am I able to take the idea of God as found in the Jewish tradition and trans- pose it into the key of modern religion? They have been told by Milton Steinberg in the series of lectures on Theology which he is now giving that there are two kinds of religion, theistic and non-theistic. What they would like to be told is that they could be rabbis on the basis of non-theistic reli- gion. This I told them plainly they could not do, since as rabbis their main function was to maintain the identity and continuity of the Jewish tradi- tion. That tradition minus the God belief is like the play of Hamlet with- out Hamlet. This amazing statement from Kaplan indicates a significant movement from the realm of predicate theology to the transnatural, from the im- manent to the transcendent. "A non-theistic" religion was just not ac- ceptable for a practicing rabbi, Kaplan believed. Let us begin our analysis of the above quotation with the notion of loyalty that he mentions at the end of his statement. We praise the vir- tue of loyalty, but there can be no loyalty without the "other" to whom we are loyal. Kaplan also tells us that the virtue of piety implies an ob- ject or a correlative, as he calls it. We must, in other words, move from the ideal of piety to the object of that emotion. In the same way, he maintains that there exists in all of us an urge to salvation or a will to salvation, and we must move from this urge to contemplating its refer- ent. For Kaplan, the object of piety is not merely something intellec- tual but a matter of direct experience: "They (the students) admit the existence of a will to salvation, but they see no need for positing a tran- scendent correlative of that will. Of course, my contention is not that I intellectually posit it, but that I experience it with the same immediacy as I do my own self."29 This passage is not the first time that Kaplan talked of experiencing the presence of God. His discussion of the presence of God in The Meaning of God is well known but perhaps should repeated here: The purpose in the various attempts to reinterpret the God idea is not to dissolve the God idea into ethics. It is to identify those experiences which should represent for us the actual working of what we understand by the conception of God. Without the actual awareness of His presence, experi- [110] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="13">enced as beatitude and inner illumination, we are likely to be content with the humanist interpretation of life. But this interpretation is inade- quate, because it fails to express and to foster the feeling that man's ethi- cal aspirations are part of a cosmic urge, by obeying which man makes himself at home in the universe.3 One last statement on the matter of Kaplan's transnaturalism and its similarity to Emerson again comes from a conversation with the rabbin- ical students at the Jewish Theological Seminary and is reported in the diary entry for October 3, 1939. What we have here is the clearest state- ment from Kaplan of an Emersonian God, which we must understand as the Oversoul. Once more the students seem not to understand-just as Buber misunderstood-that God is more than the sum of man's highest ideals. Kaplan continues: The point which I then made [to the students] was that mind, which is the very ground of reality and experience, is experienced as self on the hither end and as God on the end of one's self. This makes self and God correl- ative terms. The fact is that self has always been a correlative term. What the correlate was, depended upon the cultural and social development of the individual. This remarkable passage reflects a belief almost identical to Emerson's Oversoul. Perhaps it might be helpful in our pairing of Kaplan and Emerson to recall one of Emerson's key formulations from his essay "The Oversoul." There he states: 'When the universal soul breathes through a man's intellect, it is genius; when it breathes through his will, it is virtue; when it flows through his affection, it is love."31 In Kaplan's use of the concept of correlative, we also find also a hint of Herman Cohen. Kaplan had a deep and abiding interest in Cohen, though he was critical of Cohen's anti-Zionism. In a work published in 1964, Kaplan gives a running commentary on key quotations from Cohen. Of special interest is the following comment by Kaplan on Cohen's notion of revelation: Cohen's version of the God idea as a correlative is, no doubt, his most original and important contribution to the vitalization of religion. It in- hibits the mind from the tendency to hypostatize, or to personify, Divin- ity, and turns our attention to the only true source of a genuine understanding of what we should mean by God. That source is, as Cohen reminds us frequently, rational man. By identifying that in man which makes him rational or fully human, Cohen assumes, we arrive at the cos- mic idea which spells God.32 [111] Kaplan and Emerson Mel Scult Mel Scult</page><page sequence="14">Kaplan was not a systematic theologian and so never fully spelled out his concept of the transnatural. Yet we now understand that it would be a mistake to limit Kaplan to the Durkheimian concept of God as the highest ideals that any society holds forth. What we have found is that Kaplan moves into that circle of thinkers who are genuinely religious thinkers, who strive throughout their lives for an understanding not only of the human condition but of the larger universe-what Dewey called "the enveloping whole." The transnatural is, for Kaplan the ratio- nalist, the realm of the thinkable rather than the realm of the ineffable. His movement on the theological plane was asymptotic, which is to say that throughout his life he moved closer and closer though perhaps he never achieved a full understanding. It is fitting that we end with the familiar admonition from Rabbi Tarfon in the Ethics of theFathers: "The day is short, the task is great, the workers indolent, the reward bountiful, and the Master insistent! You are not obliged to finish the task, neither are you free to neglect it."33 Kaplan never neglected his quest for the divine; indeed, it was the cen- terpiece of his very being. Notes 1 KaplanJournal, Sept. 12, 1936. Kaplan was a prodigious diarist. His diary begins in 1913 and ends in the late 1970s; it totals some 27 volumes. The originals can be found at theJewish Theological Seminary. 2 KaplanJournal, Dec. 18, 1928. This passage and others before 1934 can be found in Communings of the Spirit: TheJournals of Mordecai M. Kaplan, vol. 1,1913-34, ed. Mel Scult (Detroit, 2001), 288. A second volume, cov- ering the years 1934-51, is in preparation. 3 Mordecai M.

Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People (New Haven, Conn., 1972), 605. 9 Kaplan was excommunicated at a meeting of the Agudat Harabanim, the Society of Rabbis of the United States and Canada (an ultra-Orthodox [112] Jewish Social Studies</page><page sequence="15">group) at the Hotel McAlpin inJune 1945. See New York Times, June 15, 1945. 10 The Baeck and Emerson prayers discussed here are found in the journal entry for Aug. 23, 1942. The Heschel prayer based on Heschel's article is found in the journal entry for Sept. 19, 1942. 11 For an account of the relationship between Kaplan and Heschel focusing on the liturgy, see Mel Scult, "Kaplan's Heschel: A View from the Kaplan Diary," ConservativeJudaism 54, no. 4 (Summer 2002). Also in that article the reader will find an account from Kaplan's diary of the famous inci- dent involving Professor Lieberman, who would not talk to Kaplan after the excommunication (herem) when the two were in the elevator at the seminary. 12 I learned of this looseleaf prayer book some years ago, but it was a deeply emotional experience when I recently discovered a copy among the pa- pers of Ira Eisenstein, z.l., at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. There I found Kaplan's Heschel and Kaplan's Emerson side by side. 13 Kaplan was working on the Musaf service in Aug. 1942, and he states that "one of the following selections should be read." Then follows the Kaplan- Baeck prayer, "Life Is What We Make It," and two Kaplan-Emerson prayers, including "Needed Prophets for Our Day." The obvious implica- tion is that the Emerson prayer was to be part of the Musaf service. 14 Barbara L. Packer, Emerson's Fall: A New Interpretation of the MajorEssays (New York, 1982), 119. Packer's book is by far the best of recent works on Emerson's essays. 15 Ralph Waldo Emerson, Representative Men: Seven Lectures, ed.

Kaplan quotes Emerson, giving the date of Emerson's entry as 1883, which is obviously wrong since Emerson died in 1882. See Emerson's essay "Circles" for the classic exposition of the ideas contained in this passage. I have not been able to locate the exact source of this Emerson statement. However, Emerson frequently revised state- ments he first made in his journals, and it may be that Kaplan is quoting here from an original journal entry. Another version of this statement can be found in a lecture Emerson gave at Dartmouth in 1838: "We as- sume that all thought is already long ago adequately set down in books, - all imaginations in poems; and what we say, we only throw in as confir- matory of this supposed complete body of literature. A very shallow as- sumption. Say rather, all literature is yet to be written. Poetry has scarce chanted its first song. The perpetual admonition of nature to us, is, 'The world is new, untried. Do not believe the past. I give you the universe a vir- gin to-day.'"

The fragments mentioned here are found among Kaplan's papers in the Kaplan Archive at the Reconstruc- tionist Rabbinical College. I believe these fragments are from Kaplan's unpublished work "Soterics," though the fragments contain no title. They look to be from the 1950s. 22 Mordecai Kaplan, Ha-emunah veha-musar (Jerusalem, 1954), 12.
