<plain_text><page sequence="1">BONNIE MARRANCA A COSMOGRAPHY OF HERSELF: THE AUTOBIOLOGY OF RACHEL ROSENTHAL N s T OWHERE more evocatively does performance art express the ecological condition of contemporary life at the end of the twentieth century than in the works of Rachel Rosenthal, elaborating as they do the polemics of harmony and chaos that so many seek to moderate in their lives and in the world around them. This antinomy is at the heart of her dramaturgy, and since performance art is primarily a solo form made on the body of the performer, it is, more significantly, a function of her physiology as a woman in her mid-sixties. What comes through in the performances of Rosenthal is her worldliness in the acceptance of natural history as a part of the history of the world and part of her history. Because performance art is not a tragic form, nor Rosenthal's nature tragic, comic irony is the mood of her all too human commedia. All of these themes come together like fibers of a nervous system in the kind of performances Rosenthal constructs around body, biology, and gender. She transvalues the routinely autobiographical form into what I call the autobiological, making performance a life science. Her feminism evolves a profoundly philosophical system that impels feminine principles toward an ethics of performance. Then human ethics is made symmetrical with envi- ronmental ethics, opening up a historical perspective that moves beyond the merely personal to the more broadly global. The very precise spiritual focus of her work collapses human time into cosmic time, aligning art and science. In effect, Rosenthal fuses the controversial Gaia hypothesis, the view of nature described in Chaos theory, and the perspective on geology described in the study of plate tectonics, to trace the autobiology of her life. Drawing upon issues raised by these scientific ideas, her performances are oriented increasingly around ecological themes and animal rights. But more than that the face of the earth has become a metaphor for her own physiognomy. In an early piece, Grand Canyon (1978), Rosenthal transforms into a vampire who flies over the canyon on a snowy winter day. She reads it like a topology of her life. The canyon's faults, erosion pattern, plateaus and rocks 59</page><page sequence="2">6o THE KENYON REVIEW act as signs of her life in this personal journey of metamorphosis: a geological fault is for her a matter of guilt. As narrative strategy, the journey is both real and symbolic in her work. Rosenthal's family fled Hitler's Europe, first to Brazil then to New York during World War II, and so she became a refugee, a traveler, homeless, an immigrant. Rosenthal, who lives in Los Angeles and speaks English with the New York City accent of someone who once spoke another language, has always made geography - which is to say, walking across the earth -her subject. She brings the feeling of travel into perfor- mance. Another one of her works named after a specific topography is Death Valley (1988). More metaphoric in name, this J'accuse solo is accompanied by dissonant violin, and vocal work consisting of animal sounds, Jewish religious rhythms, speech-song, and chants. The operatic reach of the piece links it to the avant-garde arias Cathy Berberian was known for in Europe a few decades ago. In any case, music has always been an essential element in Rosenthal's performance style, based as it is so freely in the timbre of the voice. Her declamations often assume the character of song. In this piece she develops the theme of collaborator: "By being alive I have tacitly agreed to ... ." Dressed in a long blue, white, and black robe, long black gloves, and wearing black lipstick and eye shadow, the elegant, bald-headed Rosenthal recites a litany of horrors that includes "obscenity of the food chain," "carnage of the earth," "stealing habitats," and "chemical warfare." At times Rosenthal takes on the cry of a coyote. She feels constant pain in her knees. The world is disjointed. Indeed, the year 1988 brought worldwide ecological turmoil. A large scale piece with live animals, The Others (1984) takes up the issue of animal liberation, a prominent motif in later performances. Here Rosenthal attacks the Cartesian view of animals as "thoughtless brutes" without con- sciousness. She speaks for their victimhood, or otherness, focusing their exploitation by science as a rights issue. Some may find problematic Rosenthal's biocentrism because of its inherent antihumanist view. But it is at the core of her performances, the philo- sophical foundation of their "deep ecology" perspective. Within the ecologies of theater which I have been outlining in recent years, Rosenthal has affinities with the biocentric worldview reflected also in the works of Meredith Monk and Robert Wilson. These artists elucidate the utopian line of thinking in late twentieth-century theater, creating nonhierarchical performance worlds populated by human and nonhuman species. Even more so, they share an interest in cosmology. Biocentrism helps to illuminate Rosenthal's interest in Gaia, the ancient earth goddess of the Greeks, and the poetic essence of her personally revealing work, L. 0. W. in Gaia (1986). Here, in the true spirit of performance art, centered in the body as text, Rosenthal takes on the persona of Gaia herself. James Lovelock, whose two books on the Gaia theme draw on contemporary thinking in geology, geochemistry, evolutionary biology, and climatology,</page><page sequence="3">BONNIE MARRANCA 6I offers a view of the earth and the life it bears as a "physiological system." He regards it as a self-regulating organism rather than inert rock upon which plants and animals live. In this scheme of things, the health of the planet mat- ters more than that of individual species or organisms. If the word theater derives from the Greek theatron, which means theory, then the Gaia hypothesis is at the heart of Rosenthal's definition of the theatrical. I think of her as the Great Mother of Performance. Lynn Margulis, Lovelock's colleague in first putting forth the challenging idea of Gaia, views symbiosis rather than the random accumulation of muta- tions as a source of evolutionary change and diversity. The reciprocal action between organism and environment-in sociological terms, a partnership society-is favored over that of competition among individuals. Margulis's contention that the earth is autopoietic-self-maintaining-sits comfortably with the contemporary psychology of self-actualization that Rosenthal affirms. This perspective on Gaia -its rebuke to the belief that environment dominates life or humans the environment-is emphasized in Rosenthal's noncoercive dramaturgy, based not on the Aristotelian notion of interactive conflict but on a more process-oriented, open, nonhierarchical model. It is documentary rather than dramatic in nature, chaotic rather than unified. Scientifically based Necessity overrules Fate. L. 0. W. in Gaia is a chronicle of a three-week vacation Rosenthal took in the Mojave Desert. In this work she shows color slides of herself there in a rented van, and recounts her adventures hiking and preparing meals, even brief encounters with humans. She praises the beauty of the stars in the dry, silent night, and the enchanting sound of a coyote concert. But Rosenthal is no sentimentalist. Little by little the haunting scenes of the desert landscape shown in the montage of slides gives way to images of the desert floor littered with the detritus of the civilized world. Accompanying voice-overs and visual texts - by Gary Snyder, William Catton, Aldo Leopold, and others - provide commentary on nuclear radiation, pollution, technological profligacy, human irresponsibility. Here in the desert are the unmistakable allusions to ancient religion and myth and, in our own time, to nuclear testing and missile sites. The voice of the sagebrush whistles in the desert wind: nuclear crisis is one of metaphysical dimension. One of the profound themes in Rosenthal's work is the understanding that the ecosystem is inseparable from the cultural system of a people. This insight returns to the ancient view of the world in which history, myth, religion, ecology, philosophy, and aesthetics were considered together in any reflection on human affairs. Rosenthal is simply forcing performance to accept its place in the history of ideas. The feeling for landscape is at the very marrow of the American psyche. Rosenthal's diaristic performance problematizes the town vs. country theme - she is drawn to the desert but lives in Los Angeles - so familiar to nature writing, and the myth of the sublime western landscape with its boundless resources. She brings into high relief the very real possibility of ecological catastrophe.</page><page sequence="4">62 THE KENYON REVIEW L. O. W. in Gaia then is no mere eclogue singing the praises of desert solitaire, but a cry of rage to Gaia, in Rosenthal's adopted voice of a Crone. A ritualistic mood transforms this performance conceived in part as a medita- tion, in the small altar of bones she constructs around her, close to which she places a candle, and sanctified by her incantatory language. Rosenthal's totemism also gives a feeling of the sacred to her performance which is more of a rite. Her head -on which she will trace in lipstick the number "60" (for her sixty years when the work was created) as a kind of magical act - only serves to enhance her mystique as a woman of special qualities. Indeed, she is a crone. In prepatriarchal mythology, linked as it was to ecology, the Crone -the force of life and death -formed part of the three-in-one unity that comprised Virgin, Mother, Crone. Very cleverly, she weaves around the concept of time the condition of her own aging body, and that of the earth. So human time is apprehended in the sweep of cosmic time, and myth joined to history. Even more so, Rosenthal develops the theme as a cosmography of herself, drawing upon this suppressed women's history. However appealing the Gaia hypothesis is as a way of understanding life on the planet, I am somewhat skeptical of Lovelock's recent book on the sub- ject, The Ages of Gaia, in which he invokes comparison between Gaia and the Virgin Mary. Though she certainly regards the earth with a sense of the sacred, Rosenthal's own ethos is nondenominational, fully secular, even pagan. In the ancient stone of Marble Mountain she sees an anthropomorphic likeness of the Death Crone. She reflects on death and dying. A sequence of slides is projected on the back wall of the performance space, unfolding in a series of portraits of Rosenthal in her own "Ages of Woman." While the autobiographical images unfold behind her she takes an electric razor over her bald head as if to fully erase history, and with it the seductiveness of youth, of woman, of victim. Then she speaks in one of her characteristic Euripidean women s voices: -----I am the Crone The third aspect of the Triple Goddess. The one you fear. You can accept the Virgin, barely stomach the Mother, but me, you have attempted to destroy. I am your death. Not the glamorous death of battles, of heroism, of blood spilled for a cause. No, I am gout, ulcers, rheumatism, Alzheimer's, and cancer. I am Nemesis of the Greeks. Morgan Le Fay of the Celts . .. In India I am Kali the Black In Scandinavia, Hel-Queen of the Shades ... I am the Night Mare, the black mare-headed Demeter, Demeter Chthonic, the Subterranean. Your culture turned me into a devil. You reject me. You despise and fear older women.</page><page sequence="5">BONNIE MARRANCA 63 If one of the most profound philosophical implications of theater is the moment-to-moment dying of the performer's body before the eyes of the audi- ence, Rosenthal carries this thought to an extreme by making it the subject of her performance. Moreover, she then links this theme to the aging of the earth, of Gaia, and the desecration of the earth's body through the forces of com- modification and relentless human destructiveness. In its most subtle elabora- tion as feminist commentary she brings together the exploitation of women's bodies and the body of the earth, that is, women's rights and biotic rights. The origin of life at the Big Bang now seems certain, but Rosenthal sees its destiny as the Big Crash. Her nightmarish vision of the future is physicalized in the fortieth-century Monster she impersonates at the beginning and end of the performance: an androgynous creature who is bent over, jaw fused open, lipless, hands bereft of their tensile ability. The Monster will find in the ground bits and pieces of disks marked with a warning symbol announcing waste disposal nearby. The waste remains, but not the human race. In Rosenthal's work, not only L. 0. W. in Gaia but in those pieces which address her grand themes of nuclear holocaust, pollution, consumerism, the forces of nature, the myth of progress, such as Death Valley, Was Black, Pangaean Dreams, she condemns developments in history that have led to humankind's separation from the natural world. She evokes the nature/culture opposition even as she humorously explores her own contradictions in the face of it. But Rosenthal is not anti-technological (her performances demand a sophisticated use of technology), she is not anti-Western (all cultures' wanton destruction of their land is acknowledged), and she is not anti-modernist (her work sits comfortably in the century-long tradition of avant-garde perfor- mance). All of these positions have found a place in the environmentalist cri- tique, but not with Rosenthal. In fact, she is more materialist than mystic despite her conviction that the crisis of culture is a spiritual one. Rosenthal offers a model of the performance artist who can imagine life- sustaining images amidst the imagery of extinction. She transforms the Death Crone into the creative force of the death-defying artist who can generate essential new myths for today. In a perversely classical sense, L. 0. W. in Gaia is a public enactment of the myths of the community, a feminist satyr play to be considered alongside the classics. Rosenthal dares to expose herself to the certain beauty in facing terror, the evil that is human, dreamed of by Artaud in his own radical autobiology. Singularly, she carries his disturbing chaotic spirit into American performance art where she is author, director, spectacle, signaling through the hot air of global warming, if not the flames. Her bald head becomes a blank surface on which to reflect the history of the world, a mirror of its horror. The Crone is the ancient presence of the "Other" in her body: her double. The foreground of the performance is her own agonized body, now a theater where Artaud's "spiritual therapeutics" is acted out for the social body. Her body politics reaches out toward healing. Where else can one go with the final image of Was</page><page sequence="6">64 THE KENYON REVIEW Black, a response to the Chernobyl disaster (and a literal translation of the Russian word), when the performers wrap around her torso and face a long cord whose tiny bulbs light up suddenly, reflecting in gruesome metaphor the radiated body. Rosenthal projects from her body a special kind of performance knowledge, a womanly knowledge, the physiological understanding of images that is the powerful inner light of visionary performance. It is the spectacular autobiology of a performer one wants to know and to learn from, the very embodiment of the kind of illumination a body of knowledge bestows. Yet, all the while Rosenthal walks in the realm of myth, she is demythologizing herself. A highly self-conscious performer, more theatrical and literary than most performance artists, she is forever finding "another self- made myth to explode." Among her favorite devices is the double or split self in dialogue, and the sudden about-face from a serious political diatribe on a social issue to a personal revelation of her own complicity in the problem. How to pursue further the possibility that the Great Mother mystique may unlock the possibility of a mother-daughter story? The ironic play between masking and unmasking is nowhere more poi- gnant than in Rosenthal's exposure of the very subject of performance art -the body-to laughter, even pity, and more frighteningly, fear. Here is a per- former confronting aging, one of the great taboos of performance life. Her body, she allows, is not the perfect instrument it is supposed to be as a perform- ing body. "Why is every performance so hard? Why do I suffer like this?" Rosenthal personalizes the condition of Chaos theory's fractal (self) in Pangaean Dreams (1990), a piece about motion: What could be more difficult for Rosenthal, with her decades-old knees problem (Wilson has his knee plays, she has hers). Osteoporosis is acknowledged as structural principle in the body of pain. With her wheelchair entrance, and talk of plastic knees, back trouble and fractured vertebrae, Rosenthal only underscores the lithe, puppetlike quality of her performances, in all its tragicomic implications. Rosenthal has a marvelously trained body, a mime's light-footedness and legerdemain, and one watches in performance a body struggling to act -the way one looks at aging dancers, or listens to aging singers -with a heightened awareness of nature's competitiveness with art. Given that performance is a function of the body, and with an aging, still-active avant-garde, it is surprising that this subject is not more important to artists, especially women who stand to gain so much in the lifting of taboos on the aging female body/performer/image. The biological is the dangerous staging ground for the struggle between theory and praxis, or, desire and experience. Rosenthal positions herself in this dialectic, creating for it a frame of reference full of poetry and panache. If in L. 0. W. in Gaia Rosenthal drew a metaphoric link between her aging body and the earth's body, in Pangaean Dreams she considers the break-</page><page sequence="7">BONNIE MARRANCA 65 ing apart of her body in the context of continental drift and plate tectonics. Again, the personal is extenuated to the global. As a resident of California, she can't help but anticipate the Big Rift. In this recent work, subtitled "A Shamanic Journey," Rosenthal descends into the underworld to search for answers to the mystery of existence. An accompanist beats the drum that induces her altered state of consciousness. Rosenthal chants and rattles to the four corners of the earth. Roaming around the bowels of the earth inside a video image she discovers the workings of plate tectonics. It shapes for her an entirely revolutionary worldview. Scoffed at for decades, Alfred Wegener's idea that the surface of the earth is divided into a small number of rigid drifting plates on which con- tinents driven by hot, upwelling fluids move and interact with each other, has become in recent times a fully elaborated perspective on the distribution of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. In fact, the earthquake in the Mojave Desert in June, 1992, gave scientists a look at what they believe is a new tectonic system that is cutting California away from North America and moving it toward Alaska. In a development not without its cultural irony, the Baja region of Mexico is pushing northward on its Pacific plate, unnerving the San Andreas Fault. So Rosenthal's sense of continental drift has real repercus- sions in her life, as well as scientific legitimacy. She, Rachel Rosenthal, living at the end of the twentieth century, is part of a process that began about 250 million years ago when the continents of the world formed a single mass, called "Pangaea," which broke up into several continents that have been drifting ever since. As she reads the signs of her life in the earth itself, the semiological swells into the seismological. Nothing is what it seems. But now she has a radical understanding of time and space and personal upheaval. In another light, the discovery of the workings of plate tectonics was largely circulated at the same period of Cubist painting which captured the fractured, shifting planes of reality on an unstable surface. It is this Cubist vision, which in fact destroyed perspective as it had evolved since the Renaissance, that adds a metaphysical footnote to the scientific findings. The knowledge that Rosenthal received about the earth on her under- world travels is presented in the form of the shamanic trance as the Big Pic- ture-a moving picture projected on the surface of a long robe she wears, unfurled by sticks which stretch the robe wide as she opens her arms. It is a col- lage of dinosaurs, flocks of birds, ships, refugees, cowboys, Indians, cities, trains, factories, bridges: dislocation - a theme of the work - as life principle. Everyone is on the move. If Rosenthal formerly longed for unity, rapprochement, now she accepts the way of the world as constant flux. Call her the Heraclitus of the perfor- mance world. Plate tectonics defines a state of mind, and Rosenthal considers all of its convulsive realignments "a learning experience." A simple event can turn into a ground-breaking perception. In a fantastic California-inspired image she sees the plate as a skateboard weaving around everyday activities.</page><page sequence="8">66 THE KENYON REVIEW Even the structure of Pangaean Dreams seems to be affected by the idea of the plate: separate parts of the stage space act as plates (planes) in which different kinds of performance occur, the shamanic journey or Rosenthal as herself. The concept of the plate also evolves into the plane surface on which slides or video are projected throughout the piece. In this context, plate tectonics sug- gests a provocative interpretation of collage which has always been the organizing principle of Rosenthal's work. Added to this view are the lessons of Chaos theory which, in this context, allows for the comparison of human relationships to earth's tremors, magnetic fields, strange attractors. In other words, predictable turbulence is the law of nature. These scientific attitudes are joined to an all-embracing Gaia image to form a comprehensive ecosophy which declares indivisible the ecosystem and the cultural, economic, political, and psychological systems of a people. The human body will share the same nervous system as Gaia because nature and culture cannot be disjoined into separate environments. It is this split in "human nature" that Rosenthal's work addresses. Themes of conflict and duality are explored in Rosenthal's dialogue with her male double, the personification of her pain which she refers to as the "Autonomous Being." He challenges her to account for her conflicting selves: Rosenthal is a worshipper of the Great Mother who disdains childbirth, a nature lover who cannot do without the amenities of conventional hygiene, a celebrator of womanhood who hates its biological imperatives. The most pro- vocative exchange between Rosenthal and her Autonomous Being comes in a discussion about gender in which he questions her feminism. Rosenthal answers that she is "a gay man in a woman's body." Autobiologically speaking, her identity crisis is a provocation of enormous complexity. "Men don't want me because they sense something funny. Gay men don't want me because they see me as a woman. Women want me but I don't want them because I want men -but not as a woman . . . !" Formidable seismologies erupt from the rhetorical body in this chaotic discourse of signs and shifting surface texts. In another section of the performance Rosenthal talks about men and women and love in the style of a thirties French film: taunting, seductive, pushing to extremes. Love is flaccid, feminine, and amorphous; hate is vigorous, masculine, linear. Rosenthal is a feminist who can make feminists uncomfortable with their sexual positions because she gives voice to the unmentionable subjects, first rhetorically, then philosophically. In this sense, she is closer in spirit to the mocking sophistication, even decadence, of Pina Bausch. Both older women eschew the frequently girlish, politically safe attitudes in performances by women, for a more dangerous worldliness and womanliness where Eros and Irony share the stage. What's especially engaging about Rosenthal is the great, good humor that characterizes her performances: quite simply, the comedy that is always attached to the biological in human drama. Rosenthal has a real earthiness and scatological sense which, when accompanied by the release from etiquette age</page><page sequence="9">BONNIE MARRANCA 67 can bring, leads to a decided freedom of expression. Who but she would worry about the methane content released into the environment by human beings? "From the Gaian perspective, we may be only as important as our farts," she confides to her audience. Part of Rosenthal's "aura" is the multiple imagery of her own per- sona-the sense of glamour she exudes, the very sensual gestures of the long hands, her redoubtable femaleness always flirting with androgyny, the drop earrings, the remnants of French sweetness in the voice. All of these qualities coexist with the bald head and deliberate dressing down, cross-dressing, at times in army fatigues; then there's the raunchy language and cutting through of taboos, the disturbing thoughts. Rosenthal is as much a personality as a per- former, in the expansive modernist sense. Her performances stylize her desire for an out-of-body experience. Or is it Artaud's dream, still alive today, of the body without organs? Dismemberment is part of shamanism, and in Pangaean Dreams this component of the journey is transmuted into Rosenthal's frequent digging up of bones and body parts throughout the performance. They are bit by bit fitted together on an armature, until at the end of the performance the (partly) reconstructed body is hoisted about the performance space. Rosenthal has unearthed her own remains. The Autonomous Being had told her she was "part angel, part dinosaur," but most remarkably, part of the great chain of life since prerecorded history. It's the structure - the bones of a thought - that has always mattered to Rosenthal. If, as Mircea Eliade has written, shamanism is a technique of ecstasy, then so is making art, following as it does the same trajectory of dismember- ment and resurrection. The unmistakable allusion is that artists, like scientists, give themselves up to the quest for new worlds, and often they are ridiculed when they attempt to describe them. Pangaean Dreams is Rosenthal's Tempest. For Rosenthal the new worldview is plate tectonics which can at last explain her own body/continent of restless desire. Not for her the dance of death in the face of Chaos. She prefers the tectonic boogie, one of the new lazzi for the twenty-first century. When one plate moves, all move. That's the law of Chaos and I accept. I nod Yes. I will live my allotted time torn apart by my duality, kicking and screaming all the way. With the violent love of Gaia. With fear and trembling and loving care. With the Pangaean dinosaur ensconced in my brain. In the Earth. Of the Earth. In the world. Of the world. Rosenthal's ecological testament reflects her profound understanding of the life force. In her search for enlightenment she discovers an ironic lesson: wisdom is insecurity. Learn the tectonic boogie / Or you've had it, Baby.</page></plain_text>
