Viano General Motors Research Labs. Biomedical Science Dept. Warren, Ml Harold J. Mertz General Motors Corp. Current Product Engrg. Warren, Ml ABSTRACT Measurement of chest compression is vital to properly assessing injury risk for restraint systems. It directly relates chest loading to the risk of serious or fatal compression injury for the vital organs protected by the rib cage. Other measures of loading such as spinal acceleration or total restraint load do not separate how much of the force is applied to the rib cage, shoulders, or lumbar and cervical spines. Hybrid III chest compression is biofidelic for blunt impact of the sternum, but is "stiff" for belt loading. In this study, an analysis was conducted of two published crash reconstruction studies involving belted occupants. This provides a basis for comparing occupant injury risks with Hybrid III chest compression in similar exposures. Results from both data sources were similar and indicate that belt loading resulting in 40 mm Hybrid III chest compression represents a 20-25% risk of an AIS&gt;3 thoracic injury. AS EARLY AS 1968, Gadd and Patrick had discussed an important principle of occupant protection. The upper body can sustain more force than the rib cage alone if force is applied to the shoulders and other upper body regions. They recognized that injury risk assessment for the rib cage and the underlying vital organs, such as the heart and lungs, must be independent of measures of the total restraining force applied to the upper body. Thus, thoracic spine acceleration, which sums the effects of the force inputs from the rib cage, shoulders and arms, abdomen, neck, and lumbar spine, cannot provide direct injury assessment of loading to the rib cage and the resulting compression injury risk to vital underlying organs. Patrick's and many following studies have developed a basis for thoracic injury assessment which clearly demonstrates that the risk of rib cage and underlying organ injury can be directly and objectively based on chest compression. Vehicle restraint systems such as air bags, shoulder belts, and steering wheels involve frontal loading of the rib cage, shoulders, and other torso regions. For these restraints, it is important to separate rib cage loading from loads on the other torso regions to properly assess injury risk to this vital body region. Knowledge of chest acceleration or total restraint load is not sufficient to determine this important load distribution issue. The higher tolerance to total impact force when upper body loads are shared between the chest and shoulders was a critical factor in the development of the energy absorbing (EA) steering system. Much of the safety literature has focused on the force limiting element, such as an axial compression column, and FMVSS 203 evaluates "impact- force". However, the load distributing properties of the steering wheel were also fundamental to the success of the system in saving lives and preventing injuries, Horsch et al. (1991). The role of load distribution was twofold: 1) to have sufficient area of the hub 1875</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 1. Demonstration of the importance of load sharing between the rib cage and shoulders for upper body restraint based on Gadd and Patrick (1968). They concluded that the upper body could sustain more than twice the load than that by the rib cage alone. Chest compression can be used to objectively assess the risk of thoracic injury related to the chest load. In these two conditions, the chest load and compression are similar even though the overall tolerable load is substantially greater with combined loading. 1876</page><page sequence="3">to distribute impact force on the rib cage and 2) to have a sufficient wheel rim structure to simultaneously apply load on the shoulder region, Figure 1. Horsch and Viano (1984) demonstrated the importance of the Hybrid III dummy and chest compression response to assess the load distributing performance of steering wheels. Sled tests were conducted with an EA steering column and two types of steering wheels: a steering wheel which loaded both the rib cage and the shoulders; and a flat, 152 mm diameter rigid disk which loaded only the rib cage. Although the impact force and chest acceleration were slightly less for the disk, all of the load with the disk was applied to the rib cage with a corresponding 80% greater compression of the rib cage. The greater chest compression with the disk provided a force limiting and energy absorbing mechanism, slightly reducing impact force and spine acceleration. A restraint system should limit force and absorb energy. It should minimize compressing the occupant's chest for these functions. Only the Hybrid III dummy could demonstrate that the steering wheel provided superior restraint for the torso when compared with the disk, and then only when using chest compression response. Although chest compression provides objective assessment of injury risk for the rib cage and underlying organs, other responses are also essential. Restraint of the human in car crashes involves loading of a complex structure having many degrees of freedom and injury modes. Measurement of greater numbers of appropriate responses relating to the torso, as well as other body regions, provide increased information for assessment of restraint performance. A dummy with a biofidelic chest compression response provides a measure of the risk of injury to the rib cage independent of the total restraint load and can thus discriminate among restraint designs as to the portion of the restraining load applied to the rib cage. Because the shoulder belt passes over the shoulder, the load sharing between the shoulder and the rib cage is an important issue for shoulder belt restraint protection. This paper reviews the biomechanical background for frontal loading of the chest and associated injury assessment methods and then examines the special features of shoulder belt loading with respect to that background. Biomechanical tests and real-world crash data are used to evaluate the appropriateness of dummy chest deflection criteria for injury assessment of shoulder belt performance. REVIEW OF THE BASIS FOR CHEST COMPRESSION RESPONSE AND INJURY ASSESSMENT An important understanding of chest impact response, injury, and safety assessment was initiated by Patrick et al. (1967) and Gadd and Patrick (1968). After a series of cadaver and human volunteer tests, they established that the tolerable loading of the upper body was strongly dependent on which torso regions supported the load. Impacts with a steering assembly demonstrated only a minor risk of rib fractures to cadavers with an 8 kN total upper body load and a load on the rib cage of less than 3.3 kN. They stated, "Correlation with Ref. 2 (Patrick et al. (1967) for load applied only to the rib cage) was obtained by providing means to separate the load on the chest alone from total torso load." Their understanding led to the need to determine the injury risk of rib cage loading independent of the total upper body load. Patrick et al. (1967), Gadd and Patrick (1968), Nahum et al. (1970,75), Kroell et al. (1971,74), and Lobdell et al. (1973) pursued chest impact response and injury assessment from static and dynamic loadings of volunteer and human cadaver chests. The most comprehensive of these studies was conducted at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and is summarized by Kroell et al. (1971,74) and Nahum et al. (1970,75). Frontal impacts were made at mid-sternum with a rigid ballistic mass having a 152 mm diameter, flat-faced disk, resulting in all of the impact load on the rib cage. These tests employed a range of impact mass, velocity, and subject size, age and condition. The 1877</page><page sequence="4">UCSD data demonstrated that blunt injury assessment should be based on compression of the chest, and that spinal acceleration or impact force are not the most accurate predictors of chest injury, Kroell et al. (1971,74) and Neathery (1974). INJURY ASSESSMENT FOR BLUNT LOADING - Injury assessment recommendations for the rib cage and underlying organs were developed from the UCSD human cadaver data by Neathery et al. (1975) for blunt frontal loading. The experiments demonstrated that when a distributed impact load is entirely directed on the rib cage, severe to critical injury occurred in the cadavers with thoracic spine accelerations of less than half of the FMVSS 208 limit of the acceleration level of 60 G for cumulative durations greater than 3 ms. However, they demonstrated that injury risk for this loading could be objectively based on maximum chest compression, scaled for subject size and age. Neathery et al. (1975) recommended a chest injury assessment value of three inches (76mm) maximum skeletal compression for a 50 percentile male in blunt frontal impact (assuming an age of 45 years old). This recommendation was based on an injury severity of AIS = 3, thus representing a 50% risk of an AIS&gt;3 for a 45 year old human cadaver, or greater than 50% risk for the UCSD subjects whose mean age was 62 years. It should be noted that AIS scaling for thoracic injury has been modified since Neathery's analysis. Subsequently, Viano (1978) showed a discontinuity in injury risk as a function of chest compression. For low levels of compression, the rib cage deformed but supported the applied load. However, with multiple rib fractures, high compression occurred which resulted in direct loading of thoracic organs and critical soft tissue injuries. To avoid crush injury to internal organs, an external compression limit of 32% was recommended to avoid rib cage collapse due to multiple fractures. There was a high risk of an AIS&gt;4 injury associated with 40% external compression. More recently Viano and Lau (1988) analyzed the UCSD chest impact data and recommended a 35% external compression based on a logist analysis of injury risk and a 25% probability of an AISM in the cadaver. Assuming an external dimension of 229 mm for the 50th percentile male, this percentage represents 80 mm of external compression. They used a factor of 1 .21 to adjust external compression to internal (skeletal) deflection. On this basis, a 35% compression represents 66 mm internal skeletal deflection. This value is likely conservative in representing the tolerance of typical car occupants because it is based on human cadavers, which lack muscle tone and reflect an older population than car occupants. However, it might well be representative of the important elderly segment of the driving population and thus representative of a reasonable tolerance threshold. Lau and Viano (1986) also identified that the velocity of compression is an important factor in assessing soft tissue injury risks from blunt impact when the velocity of chest compression exceeds 3 m/s. The Viscous criterion (VC) is an injury assessment parameter which considers the product of compression amplitude and velocity at each instant of time. They recommended a VC of 1.0 m/s as a threshold assessment level which represents a 25% risk of an AIS&gt;4 injury. For compression velocities below 3 m/s, they recommended 35% peak external compression discussed above for injury assessment of crushing injury risks. Both human cadaver and animal subjects are included in the basis of their recommendations. CHEST COMPRESSION RESPONSE - Analysis of the UCSD cadaver impact data by Neathery (1974) resulted in an empirical model and recommendations for human-like frontal impact biofidelity in terms of impact force vs chest compression at 4.3 and 6.7 m/s impact velocities with a 23.4 kg impact mass for the 50th percentile occupant. A "muscle- tensing" force of 0.67 kN was added to the force determined from the human cadaver data. This "muscle-tensing" force 1878</page><page sequence="5">was estimated from measurements of human volunteers reported by Lobdell et al. (1973). The compression response was an external measurement made by film analysis. It was adjusted to approximate skeletal compression by subtracting 12.7 mm from the compression to account for "skin" compression. Foster et al. (1977) showed that the Hybrid II dummy is very stiff compared to Neathery's recommendation, Figure 2a. They designed the Hybrid III thorax to meet the proposed response requirements. Horsch and Schneider (1988) demonstrated that the Hybrid III thorax had reasonable biofidelity beyond the calibration velocities of 4.3 and 6.7 m/s by comparing responses with human cadavers in 13.4 m/s blunt frontal thoracic impacts, Figure 2b. The Hybrid III dummy appeared stiffer than the cadavers, approximately by the muscle tensing that Neathery had added to cadaver responses. Clearly, the Hybrid III dummy represents a major improvement in thoracic impact response and injury assessment in comparison to the Hybrid II dummy, and can be considered to have biofidelity for blunt frontal impact. THORACIC INJURY ASSESSMENT FOR SHOULDER BELT LOADING Estimates of an injury assessment relationship for Hybrid III chest compression response with shoulder belt loading was made by comparing the chest compression response of the Hybrid III dummy with injuries to car occupants in "similar" exposures. Importantly, there are limitations due to the lack of exposure details for car occupants involved in crashes. However, two well documented studies of belted occupants exist in the literature which provide a basis for estimating the severity of loading to determine "equivalent" Hybrid III responses.

(1978) and Mertz et al. (1991). The force limiting or energy absorbing (EA) element consisted of a series of stitched webs that tear at a predetermined force and thus act to limit the load on the occupant by allowing a controlled elongation of the shoulder belt. Car crashes involving the use of these EA belt systems were investigated in depth by APR. Examination of the EA portion of the belt gave information on the severity of loads sustained by the occupants in those crashes. Combining this information with the occupant injury data provided an objective basis for comparing Hybrid III dummy responses for similar belt loads when tested with the APR restraint configuration. Sled tests reported by Mertz et al. (1991) were conducted with the Hybrid III dummy restrained by a lap-shoulder belt containing a type B Renault shoulder belt force-limiting element. A range of sled severities was selected which resulted in tearing 2, 4, and 5 stitch levels. Chest compression was compared with belt tension, indicating a nominally linear relation between chest compression and belt tension. For these tests, an approximate fit was found with 5 mm of compression for each kN of shoulder belt tension. On this basis, 8 kN of belt tension would result in 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression. AIS&gt;3 injury risk as a function of Hybrid III chest compression from the APR car crash data analyzed by Mertz et al. (1991) is summarized in Figure 3. Probit analysis indicates that 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression due to belt loading corresponds to a 25% risk of an AIS&gt;3 chest injury and a 20% risk of an AIS&gt;4 thoracic injury. Most of the APR real world exposures were at a lower severity than that represented by 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression. Extrapolation to higher levels of compression should consider the reported confidence levels. VOLVO CAR CRASH DATA - A comprehensive study of Volvos with lap- shoulder belts involved in frontal crashes was reported by Patrick et al. (1974). The study is unique in that the vehicles involved were similar in structure and had similar belt systems, the crash investigators were specially trained by Volvo, and a standard fixture was used to measure vehicle deformation. These features served to minimize the effect of variability in such factors on the results. Patrick et al. (1974), Nyquist et al. (1980), Kallieris et al. (1982) and Saul et al. (1983) modeled the Volvo exposures in sled experiments to determine dummy responses and cadaver injuries relative to this well documented field study. However, test responses are not in complete agreement among the various sled based studies. 99 -| ļ 7| 7 I PROBIT ANALYSIS / / 98 - - (95th. Conf. Limits) / /* ' f o&lt;_ . BOUNDED ANALYSIS / / 0 .

Injury risk relationship of APR occupant injury to Hybrid III chest compression in equivalent exposures, Mertz et al. (1991). 1880</page><page sequence="7">Patrick et al. (1974) reported similar dummy responses and belt loads between staged car crashes at Volvo's crash facilities and sled tests at WSU over a range of severities. The sled tests used a Volvo vehicle for the fixture. On this basis, we have judged that the WSU sled tests reported by Patrick, with Bohlin and Andersson from Volvo as a co-authors, represent the most reliable sled simulation for relating dummy responses to Volvo belted occupant injury risk. In general, their study produced much lower responses than those reported in the studies by Nyquist, Kallieris, and Saul. Since Patrick's study used a Sierra 1050 dummy, we have used the results of the other, more severe exposure studies to estimate the Hybrid III responses for the Volvo environment. Shoulder belt loads produced by the older design 50th percentile dummies are similar but slightly lower than those produced by the Hybrid III dummy under the same test conditions, Alem et al. (1978) and Saul et al. (1983). We based an adjustment of Hybrid II shoulder belt loads to estimate equivalent Hybrid III loads on the data from these two studies using a best fit linear regression analysis as shown in Figure 4. A linear regression analysis was also performed with the Patrick data for shoulder belt load as a function of barrier equivalent velocity (also shown in Figure 4). Only tests in which the dummy did not strike interior components were used. As indicated in Figure 4, an equivalent shoulder belt load for the Hybrid III could then be estimated for any particular barrier equivalent velocity. The example shows that for 30 mph (48 kph) the resulting Hybrid III shoulder belt load would be expected to be 6.6 kN. Nyquist et al. (1980) used the results of the Volvo study to correlate the Hybrid III dummy responses to the human occupants. This involved lap-shoulder belt sled tests performed at Wayne State University (WSU). Other sled tests at the Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) were reported by Saul et al. (1983). The Nyquist study reported a mean chest deflection of 29 mm at a 48 kph barrier velocity while the Saul study reported 40 mm at nominally the same test severity. The peak shoulder belt tensions in both studies were similar at 8.5 kN for the WSU tests and 8.2 kN for the VRTC tests. These values are much higher than the expected value of 6.6 kN based on the adjusted Patrick data. The much lower chest compression (29 vs 40 mm) found in the WSU study at a slightly higher belt load (8.5 vs 8.2 kN) . £ (a) I / / LINEAR REGRESSION LINE / £ (R-0.903) / 5 / SIERRA 1050 DATA 0 / (PATRICK at al. 1074) ui 71 &gt; / 1 z / ' - &lt; / / ¡ &lt; / 2 / I 6.2 1 oc ». / / ; I oc / I ïï / : I oc - ¿ : , ►- • 1- 5 2 4 6 8 10 m HYBRID II SHOULDER BELT LOAD (kN) 10Í ' /•&gt; (b) I ! /// 2 i /V *' 3 e ļ /77 * « /cf * s e.e ^ oc 7 $ w / ' X * o 6 / * ' X * -J /«jr av ? c/&gt; / /*/ ^ c/&gt; / ^ s 4" / ŪC / m / &gt; / r / 2 1 1 « 2 4 6 0 10 HYBRID II SHOULDER BELT LOAD (kN) FIGURE 4.

(1978) and Saul et al. (1983). 1881</page><page sequence="8">appears to be resolved when we studied the films of the WSU tests. In these tests the belt was positioned against the neck, a non- humanlike position as discussed later in this paper. Our tests have shown a 34% reduction of chest compression for the belt positioned against the Hybrid III neck compared with the belt outside the neck "belt-guide". Accordingly, we have chosen to use the ratio between Hybrid III chest compression and shoulder belt load determined from the VRTC study as being the most representative of the two simulations of the Hybrid III dummy with the Volvo belt system. This ratio is 40 mm/8.2 kN = 4.89 mm/kN and was applied to adjusted belt loads reported by Patrick. Thus, at a barrier equivalent velocity of 30 mph (48kph) the expected Hybrid III chest deflection would be 6.6 kN x 4.89 mm/kN = 32 mm. There are data on 98 restrained occupants in the Volvo study which we re- analyzed to estimate the probability of chest injury associated with a particular crash severity. The chest injuries were recoded using AIS (1990) injury scaling. The injury ratings were analyzed using a Logistic regression to produce probabilities of an AIS£1, an AIS&gt;2, or an AIS&gt;3 chest injury as a function of crash severity. The relationship between Hybrid III chest deflection and crash severity, as estimated using the method described above for the Volvo restraint system, allowed the probability curves to be interpreted in terms of Hybrid III chest compression. The results are shown in Figure 5. A compression of 40 mm would have probabilities of an AIS&gt;2 injury of 38% and an AIS&gt;3 injury of 24% for actual car occupants by this analysis. The probability of AIS£3 injury estimates associated with Hybrid III chest compressions in the 30 to 50 mm range agree quite well with the estimates from the APR data. As with the APR field data, most of the Volvo real world exposures were at a lower severity than that represented by 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression and thus has reduced confidence in extrapolation of injury risk to higher levels of compression. COMPARISON OF THORACIC INJURY ASSESSMENT FOR BELT AND BLUNT LOADING The objective of this study was to evaluate biomechanical considerations for thoracic injury assessment based on Hybrid III chest compression with belt loading. The APR and Volvo field data indicated injury risk relationships with Hybrid III chest compression that are mutually supportive. A 25% risk of an AIS¿3 injury for car occupants is associated with a belt loading exposure resulting in about 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression. This is more conservative than the 66 mm recommended by Viano and Lau (1988) for a 25% risk of an AIS¿4 injury to cadavers for blunt loading. This is consistent with observations that the Hybrid III exhibits less deflection of the chest than human cadavers or volunteers with belt loading, Backaitis and St. -Laurent (1986), and Cesari and Bouquet (1990).

Also, we critically examined the Hybrid III chest compression response for belt loading. ANALYSIS OF BELT RESTRAINED HUMAN CADAVER TESTS - Exposure conditions for sled tests with human cadaver subjects can be objectively defined and thus test conditions for determining "equivalent" Hybrid III responses can also be objectively defined. However, there are limitations in extrapolating human cadaver injury response to represent car occupant injury risk due to deficiencies of the human cadaver to represent car occupants in terms of impact response and injury response. Human cadaver tests also differ from field data due to the range of exposure severities in car crashes contrasted with specific and generally severe exposure conditions associated with cadaver sled exposures. However, cadaver test results can provide additional insight into the injury assessment for both blunt and belt loading based on Hybrid III chest compression. University of Heidelberg Tests - Kallieris, et al. (1982) reported on a sled test series of 12 fresh cadavers simulating the Volvo restraint environment at 30 mph. The ages of the subjects were considerably younger than other reported studies with human cadaver subjects. The ages ranged from 18 to 51 years, with a mean age of 31 .4. Three of the subjects were female. The thoracic injury ratings were given as AIS = 3 for 10 subjects and an A/S = 2 for two young male subjects. Two 51 year old male subjects sustained 12 and 14 rib fractures which currently would be coded AIS = 4. Saul et al. (1983) observed 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression and 8.2 kN peak shoulder belt tension from his simulation of the Heidelberg tests. This comparison indicates a high risk of an AIS&gt;3 thoracic injury to "younger" cadavers exposed to a test condition resulting in 40 mm chest compression for the Hybrid III. HSRI Whole Body Response Study - A sled based study was conducted at the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI), now UMTRI (University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute), with belt restrained human cadavers, a Hybrid II dummy, and a Hybrid III dummy (Alem et al. (1978)). The data provide a comparison of Hybrid III chest compression and injuries to human cadavers under similar belt restraint and sled exposure conditions. Three exposure severities of 15, 20, and 30 mph were used. Subjects tested at the lowest severity had multiple exposures and thus cannot be used in the following analysis of injury risk. Only cadavers exposed to a single test are considered. Chest compression for the Hybrid III dummy was reported as 12 mm and 25 mm and peak shoulder belt tension as 5.3 kN and 8.3 kN respectively in the intermediate and high severity tests. Chest compression is low compared to other test data with the dummy for these shoulder belt tensions. The HSRI test films show that the shoulder belt was against the dummy neck. The dummy neck is narrower than the human neck and thus this belt routing cannot be obtained for a human. Test results discussed later indicates a 34% reduction of chest compression for the belt against the Hybrid III neck compared with the belt outside the margin of the human neck. Chest compression for the highest severity HSRI test condition on this basis would adjust to 38 mm from 25 mm (2S/.66) and to 23 from 15 mm in the intermediate severity test and would reflect a more appropriate chest compression response for the Hybrid III dummy in those test exposures. Three human cadaver subjects were exposed to the high test severity. Their ages were 57, 72, and 73 years. These subjects had 12, 40 and 18 rib fractures respectively, all having at least an AIS = 4 injury. This indicates an almost certain risk of an AIS¿4 for the subjects at an exposure severity resulting in 38 mm Hybrid III chest compression. Four cadavers were exposed to the intermediate test severity, ages 47, 50, 57, and 88 years. These subjects had 6, 7, 10, 1883</page><page sequence="10">and 13 rib fractures respectively. The ratio to adjust chest compression from 15 to 23 mm for belt routing was determined at much higher exposure severities. Extrapolating by the ratio of Hybrid III chest compression to shoulder belt tension found in the APR analysis indicates 26 mm for 5.3 kN tension or 25 mm using the ratio found by Saul. Although these extrapolations are large, they appear mutually supportive. Thus, rib fractures to human cadavers appear to be associated with shoulder belt loading situations resulting in under 30 mm of Hybrid III chest compression. Injury Risk for Cadavers - The results suggest that human cadavers are more easily injured than car occupants for similar exposures. Analysis for young cadaver subjects suggests nearly a 100% risk of AIS&gt;3 injuries for an exposure severity resulting in 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression and AIS&gt;4 for older subjects. This constrasts markedly with the estimated 20-25% risk of an AIS¿3 injury for similarly exposed car occupants. The apparent difference in tolerance between car occupant and human cadaver data bases is consistent with a study by Foret-Bruno et al. (1978). Their discussion suggests that age is only part of the difference between human cadaver test subjects and car occupants, and that bone condition is important and is partly dependent on age. Cadaver injuries are more severe for belt loading than for blunt loading based on Hybrid III chest compression observed in similar test exposures. Injury risk for the cadavers as a function of Hybrid III chest compression in a similar exposure is provided in Figure 6 for both belt restraint and blunt loading. This comparison of injury risk supports a more conservative injury assessment relationship for belt loading based on Hybrid III chest compression. g ,00, co y /i/ £ /Ļ/ y 3) BLUNT § " BELT © 2 50 &lt;/&gt; oc &gt;• oc D -) Z - o -I ' - 0 40 80 HYBRID III CHEST COMPRESSION (mm) 1) BELTED - AISł3, 4 subjects, 60.3 years mean age, HSRI mid severity; 2) BELTED - AISM, 3 subjects, 67.3 years mean age, HSRI high severity; 3) BELTED - AIS&gt;3, 12 subjects, 31.4 years mean age, Heidelberg; 4) BLUNT - AIS&gt;4, 1 1 subjects, 61.1 years mean age, UCSD.

Belt loading indicated by the diagonal symbol, blunt loading by a circle. 1884</page><page sequence="11">DUMMY BIOFIDELITY - The following ^ discussion addresses reasons for a more conservative Hybrid III chest compression injury risk function for belt loading than for blunt loading. The Hybrid II is also discussed because chest compression can be measured in the Hybrid II, Horsch (1984). Comparison of Skeletal Structures - The upper torso structure of the Hybrid II and III dummies have differences from that of a human skeleton. The thoracic spine is rigid and the human thoracic spine is not. The sternal structure differs between these dummies, neither of which model the human. The Hybrid II and III rib cages lack ribs in the upper and lower thorax. In the human, the shoulder is supported by the rib cage. The clavicle attaches to the top of the sternum in the front and the scapula in the rear. Loads on the shoulder are supported by the rib cage, not directly by the thoracic spine. The Hybrid II and III shoulders are directly attached to the spine. A shoulder pivot protrudes forward from the spine in the approximate location of the proximal end of the clavicle. Loads on the ^ f Šhóuldef and clavicle region are supported by the spine in both dummies. Importantly, these structures provide a direct non human- like load path to the thoracic spine of the dummies and in some situations could result in unrealistic thoracic spine accelerations. Restraint systems such as air bags, belts, and energy absorbing steering systems apply loads not only to the rib cage, but also to other regions such as the clavicle and shoulders. Thus, the shoulder acts to share an important portion of the upper body restraining load. Because the Hybrid II and III clavicle and shoulder structures are not anatomically and structurally similar to the human, they might not distribute load in a manner similar to humans in some loading situations. The blunt frontal calibration test is aligned at mid-sternum and all of the load is below the shoulders, Figure 7. Accordingly, the load path for the calibration impact does not directly interact with the shoulders as the chest compresses and, thus, does not address biofidelity of the shoulder and clavicle regions. ft ¿à fí 7 ET t V ' *":»» X I r^' V r- Vi Blunt Impactor ¿ t No Chest Compression 50 mm Chest Compression FIGURE 7.

Horsch and Viano (1984) judged the Hybrid III as the best of frontal dummies to evaluate steering system performance. Morgan et al. (1987) have demonstrated similar responses between the Hybrid III dummy and human cadavers for impacts with steering assemblies, further confirming the suitability of Hybrid III to assess thoracic injury risk for complex loading situations. Begeman et al. (1990) has shown that the Hybrid III more closely represents human cadaver response and interaction with steering assemblies than does the Hybrid II dummy. Belt Routing - The Hybrid III neck region, unlike the Hybrid II, does not have a vinyl flesh covering. This was done to ensure repeatable neck bending response. As a result, the neck of the Hybrid III is narrower than the human neck, Figure 8. Thus, a shoulder belt can be initially placed or dynamically moved to a position "inside" the anatomic margin of the human neck. This FIGURE 8. Comparison of neck widths for a 50th percentile male and the Hybrid III dummy indicating a narrower neck for the Hybrid III which influences the shoulder belt path if it moves inside the "belt-guide". can result in a belt routing that cannot be attained for a car occupant. The Hybrid III incorporates a "belt-guide" at the margin of a 50th percentile male neck. However, due to padding and the flesh covering on the shoulder, this does not always assure that the belt remains outside of the guide. The belt placed against the neck results in the belt passing over the rigid sterno-clavicular junction, reducing chest compression. Sled tests were conducted to assess the significance of belt placement at the neck on thoracic responses and belt tensions. A lap- shoulder belt restrained Hybrid III dummy was tested with the belt placed against the neck and again with everything similar except the belt placed 50 mm laterally away from the neck. Chest compression was reduced 34% by locating the belt against the neck, Figure 9. Increasing the effective width of the Hybrid III neck to that of a 50th percentile male would prevent the possibility for this nonhuman-like belt routing and the resulting underestimation of chest compression amplitude. This would be among the advantages of developing a neck skin for the Hybrid III (Horsch et al. (1990)).

The Hybrid III thorax contains a transducer to measure the axial deflection of the sternum. The response of the chest and the method of measuring sternal deflection were developed for blunt frontal impact of the rib cage, a situation having midsagittal symmetry with a flat-faced impactor which tends to control sternal alignment. However, loading with a shoulder belt is nonsymmetrical and can contain a lateral component. The rib cage deformation under the belt likely has significant local and overall deformations which are not fully reflected by the "X" direction sternal deflection measurement. Nonuniform deformation of the rib cage with belt loading was reported by Backaitis (1986) and Cesari (1990). Because rib fractures tend to follow the belt path across the chest in human cadaver tests, Alem et al. (1978), and belt restrained occupants in severe crashes, Patrick et al. (1974), it is likely that "local" stresses and, thus, deformations are associated with belt loading. However, some rib fractures occur remote from the belt path, indicating that overall deformation is also an issue. Thus, the central measure of sternal deflection might be adequate to evaluate belt loading if the local rib deformation under the belt is effectively accounted for by the use of an injury assessment relationship that is more conservative than that for blunt loading. Dynamic Response - The Hybrid III chest has biofidelity for midsternal blunt frontal impact. The Hybrid II is too stiff, Figure 2. The response of the thorax can be considered as being composed of spring, damping, and inertial elements, Lobdell (1973). The Hybrid III has been reported to be too stiff statically, Lau and Viano (1988) and Horsch et al. (1990), but approximates the recommended responses at the 4.3 and 6.7 m/s impact velocities used to calibrate the dynamic compression response. The Hybrid III chest appears to have too great of a spring force and, on this basis, too little damping. Thus, the Hybrid III might be too stiff at compression rates observed in belt tests, which are typically less than 50% of the compression rate in the 4.3 and 6.9 m/s chest calibration tests. On this basis the Hybrid III would underestimate the amount of compression for a human. This is consistent with belt loading experiments reported by Cesari and Bouquet (1990) and Backaitis and St-Laurent (1986) in which they observed less rib deflection for the Hybrid III than for human cadavers or volunteers. DISTRIBUTION OF LOAD ON THE SHOULDER AND RIB CAGE Distribution of restraint loads between the rib cage and other upper body regions is important for steering wheel, air bag, or shoulder belt loading. Chest compression provides a measure of the specific loading to the rib cage in terms of an injury risk. The shoulder acts to share an important portion of the upper body load for a belt restraint, providing upper body restraint. The influence of the shoulder on rib cage loading by a belt was demonstrated by conducting tests with and without the shoulder for a lap- shoulder belt restraint. In both cases, the arm on that side was removed to minimize mass differences in the two test situations. The responses provided in Figure 10 demonstrate that the shoulder and clavicle provide an important belt restraint load-carrying region. Reducing the portion of belt restraining force on the shoulder increases rib cage loading and, thus, compression of the rib cage. Hybrid III chest compression increased substantially without a shoulder to share the restraining force, even though the belt load decreased slightly. Thus, the ratio of chest compression to shoulder belt load was increased by removing the shoulder, demonstrating that load sharing occurred between the shoulder and rib cage and that chest compression is influenced by this load sharing. INFLUENCE OF PELVIC DISPLACEMENT - Although removing the shoulder demonstrated the influence of belt restraint load sharing by the shoulder on chest compression, it was not a practical demonstration. In restraint system testing, 1887</page><page sequence="14">the proportion of belt load distributed between the shoulder and the rib cage is influenced by the torso angle in the x-z plane. Adomeit and Heger (1975) recommended that the upper body be tipped forward at the top to "avoid unfavorable biomechanic CHEST COMPRESSION (mm) 6O.0 r : I i 50.0 U- NO SHOULDER 40.0 j 30.0 f ' 20.0 j-i V / Z- ' HTH SHO JLDER ' lo.o f-4- 0 0 . 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 Tim« (ms) SHOULDER BELT TENSION (kN) 10.0 8.0 1/^' fy.--, y-WITH SHOULDER 6.0 f 4 4.0 j y / ' VN0 SHOULDER 2.0 -J- y ^ 0.0 1 - o 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 Tim« (ms) FIGURE 10. Test responses with belt restraint with and without shoulder (arm removed for both conditions to minimize mass differences between test situations). conditions". The belt load on the torso shifts higher on the thorax as the torso is tipped forward, thereby increasing the load on the shoulder and reducing the relative loading of the rib cage. Greater displacement of the pelvis than the chest tends to reduce forward angulation of the torso and, thus, reduce the portion of belt load on the shoulder. Submarining (the lap belt slipping over the pelvic spines) or lap belt slack can increase pelvic forward displacement for a lap-shoulder belt restraint. Rouhana et al. (1989) found greater chest compression and slightly lower shoulder belt loads associated with adding 76 mm slack to the lap belt to cause submarining. Increased spacing between the knees and knee-bolster can increase pelvic forward displacement for upper torso belts (without a lap belt). On this basis, it might be expected that Hybrid III would exhibit greater chest compression for greater pelvic forward displacement. To explore this hypothesis, 53 km/h sled tests were conducted with a lap-shoulder belt restraint or with an upper-torso belt and knee bolster restraint. For both restraints, the pelvic forward displacement was varied by lap- belt slack (snug or 100 mm) or knee- bolster spacing (140, 190, and 240 mm). Test films indicated that the torso was angulated more rearward at the top for tests having greater forward pelvic displacement. For both restraint configurations, chest compression was greater for tests with the greatest forward displacement of the pelvis and thus with the torso angulated more rearward at the top, Figure 1 1 . Importantly, the increase of Hybrid III chest compression as the pelvis was allowed to displace further forward was primarly due to more of the belt load acting on the rib cage, increasing the ratio of chest compression to belt tension, and minimally due to increased belt load, Figure 11. These factors demonstrate the importance of the chest compression response in improving the evaluation of restraint load distribution on the upper torso. 1888</page><page sequence="15">75 1 T ¿ • -2-65- / 0 / (/) / ' &lt;/) / ' Ul / ^55- dd 01 ^55- dd / g /• íf CO 45 - O £ O / 2 ex ^35- # UPPER TORSO BELT / KNEE BOLSTER ^ O LAP-SHOULDER BELT 25-1 i i i i i i 150 200 250 300 350 400 PELVIS HORIZONTAL DISPLACEMENT (mm) 7-1 ! 7 I" Z to / 22 . + (O h- 5- . co « rf LÜ « □ ' yU rf CÉ Ul ' Û- 00 y% 8s , 9- £ ^ • UPPER TORSO BELT / KNEE BOLSTER XX O LAP-SHOULDER BELT O V) 3 i i i i i i 150 200 250 300 350 400 PELVIS HORIZONTAL DISPLACEMENT (mm) FIGURE 11.

DISCUSSION The APR and Volvo field data bases provided independent estimates of the relationship between thoracic injury risk for car occupants and Hybrid III chest compression in similar exposures. These independent estimates of injury risk are more conservative than for blunt loading. However, they are mutually supportive, Figure 12, thus providing confidence that this injury risk relationship with Hybrid III chest compression is appropriate for injury assessment of shoulder belt restraints. Application of injury risk to assess performance based on laboratory tests should consider several issues. 99 1 ' i 1 i 1 i 98 95 I 90 &gt;&lt; ě s 80 D 70 īFā? &lt; 60 -A £ 50 /volvo. y/ £ £ 40 /volvo. y/ £ 30 I 20 J- s 20 10 Z_ 1 10 yL 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 HYBRID m STERNAL DEFLECTION - mm FIGURE 12. Injury risk summary for APR and Volvo car occupants as a function of Hybrid III chest compression in similar exposures. 1889</page><page sequence="16">A BASIS FOR INJURY ASSESSMENT Crash tests using instrumented dummies provide a primary means of evaluating occupant protection systems in the laboratory. Dummies are not actually "injured" in such tests, instead, a potential for injury is judged from the amplitude of injury assessment parameters which are transformed from physical measurements such as force, acceleration, velocity or displacement. The relationship between injury risk and the assessment parameter must be known if an objective inference of injury is to be associated with a safety test. The biofidelity of the dummy and the associated injury assessment measurements for important body regions are critical issues in the evaluation of occupant protection systems. Injury data indicates that people have a distribution in tolerance to impact loading, age and sex being among the important factors, Patrick et al. (1974), Foret-Bruno et al. (1978), Eppinger (1976), and Evans (1988a and 1988b). Thus, there is not a unique "tolerance", but an increasing risk of injury at greater amplitudes of the injury assessment parameter. Figure 12 provides examples. The relationship of an assessment parameter amplitude to injury outcome can be stated as a risk or probability of a defined injury as a function of loading severity. The objectivity of a given injury risk relationship depends on many factors. The quantity and quality of biomechanical data are obvious factors. A rigorous injury risk relationship cannot be developed with a "few" exposures or with marginal experiments with poorly chosen parameters. The loading environment used for the injury studies might not fully relate to the conditions for which the injury assessment parameter is being used to judge performance. The population at risk is important and depends on crash type and severity, Viano (1987), Horsch (1987), Evans (1988a and 1991), and Viano et al. (1990). The selection of acceptable response amplitudes to be associated with a particular issue or test situation is in part based on biomechanics but also includes other considerations. The selection of an injury risk and severity might depend on body region. For example, an occupant having an AIS = 4 brain injury and an occupant having an AIS = 4 liver injury might have similar chances of survival, but with very different long-term consequences to these injured survivors. Other considerations for the selection of injury risk and injury severity for an assessment value depend to some extent on the particular test situation and evaluation issues, test severity being an important issue. The arbitrary use of a single "tolerance" response amplitude, independent of the test situation or severity, is easy for the user and he might perceive that no one is being injured by his strategy if he considers his choice as a tolerable loading limit for all occupants. However, this approach does not account for the spectrum of real world car crashes and occupant tolerances, and results in incorrect perceptions of performance, (Horsch, 1987). Both the relevance of the injury assessment parameter and the biofidelity of the test dummy used to measure the injury assessment parameter are important for objective injury assessment. The availability of injury assessment instrumentation for discrete body regions is also an important issue. The Hybrid III dummy has more features that have biofidelity and has a much larger range of injury assessment instrumentation than does the Hybrid II dummy. Thus the Hybrid III is a more effective tool to assess injury risk in a crash test. However, an injury risk assessment should not automatically be applied without consideration of the biofidelity of the dummy's response in the body region of interest. INJURY RISK RELATIONSHIP TO HYBRID III CHEST COMPRESSION The APR and Volvo studies of real world crashes provide an estimate for injury risk relationship based on Hybrid III chest compression for belt loading, Figure 11. We believe that the APR data provides a more direct measure of the severity of occupant loading than the Volvo data because the APR 1890</page><page sequence="17">study bases severity on shoulder belt loading of the occupant while the Volvo study bases severity on the loading of the vehicle. The analysis of both the APR and Volvo data indicate that a belt loading of the Hybrid III thorax resulting in 40 mm of chest compression would represent about a 25% risk of an AIS&gt;3 thoracic injury. Assessment for belt loading appears to be driven by peak chest compression, not the viscous response (VC) because the rate of chest compression with belt restraints is typically well below 3 m/s compression velocity. VC becomes predominate above 3 m/s rates. However, VC should also be considered, since combined interactions with the belt and air bag or steering wheel might result in the rate of compression introducing an injury risk by a viscous mechanism. POPULATION AT RISK - The population that is represented in an injury risk function is important. These populations should not be based on the "average" person or occupant and probably differ from the distribution of car occupants. The population of the APR and Volvo field studies of car crashes represent the APR and Volvo occupants actually exposed in the investigated crashes. Injury outcome is a function of not only an occupant's tolerance, but also the severity of loading. Low tolerance occupants might experience different exposure severities than high tolerance occupants. Some information which describes the APR population (Foret-Bruno et al. (1989)) and the equivalent information for the Volvo population are provided in Table 1. The populations are divided into three age groups with the total number of occupants in each age group and the number of occupants that incurred rib fractures in each age group. The APR data contains more than twice as many occupants as the Volvo data, but the overall percentage of occupants sustaining rib fractures is similar (7.7% for APR vs 7.8% for Table 1 AGE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE APR AND VOLVO ACCIDENT SAMPLES Age Groups Total APR &lt;30 yrs. 30 to 49 * 50 yrs.

There are differences between the data sets when the individual age groups are examined, however. APR occupant age distribution is skewed toward younger age than that of the Volvo data with 37% of the Volvo occupants being in the oldest category compared with 15% in the APR data. In both data sets the youngest group had the lowest frequency of rib fractures, on the order of 2%. The greatest difference was in the oldest category where the APR data indicated a 29.8% frequency of rib fracture and the Volvo data had a frequency of only 9.8%. The reasons for such a large difference could be due to different accident sampling procedures, vehicle and restraint characteristics, and population differences related to various crash severities. Table 1 also contains a subset of 170 APR occupants which broke at least one of the shoulder belt force-limiting bands. The occupants in this subset can be considered to have definitely loaded the shoulder belt while there could always be some indeterminacy in the loading in the other APR cases and in the Volvo cases. The distribution of occupants between age groups is very similar to the overall APR sample. The frequency of occurrence of rib fractures is slightly higher, which is to be expected because this subset contains only those occupants who sustained shoulder belt loads greater than 2.1 kN (the minimum load to break one band). This subset shows a clear trend of the risk of rib fracture increasing with the age range of the group. Injury risks based on the APR and Volvo populations are relevant to the real world since they are the populations at risk in real world exposures. Because each vehicle and region in which it is operated might have unique demographics, there might not be a unique "exposed population" to apply to all situations. However, the APR and Volvo data sets provide better estimates of injury risk than basing risk on human cadavers, the average male or female, or car occupants in general. INJURY RISK FOR LARGE COMPRESSIONS - Probit Analysis of the APR data reported by Mertz et al. (1991) indicates a risk of an AIS*3 injury is 50% for 50 mm of Hybrid III chest compression and greater than 90% for 75 mm of compression, Figure 3. There is greatly reduced confidence at these larger amplitudes of Hybrid III chest compression because the APR and Volvo field exposures were infrequent at exposure severities sufficient to produce these levels of Hybrid III chest compression. Mertz et al. (1991) concluded that "only 5% of the field accidents investigated by APR would produce a Hybrid III sternal deflection of 45 mm or greater." Our analysis of the Volvo data indicates that only 5 of 98 restrained occupants were exposed sufficiently to have resulted in greater than 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression. The APR and Volvo "windows" to real world distributions of exposure severity and injury have most of the exposures and many of the injuries in crashes consistent with a "low" injury risk. This is not atypical, since, for example, the velocity change (AV) associated with a 49 kph barrier crash test is above the 98th percentile velocity change in the National Accident Sampling System (NASS), Malliaris et al. (1985), and that more than 75% of NASS occupant HARM is associated with a lower velocity change, Malliaris (1988). A Simplistic Performance Model - Projection of injuries over the distribution of real world crash severities provides a different perception of performance than that based on injury risk in a "severe" crash test, Horsch (1987). Using a simplistic analysis, the number of injured occupants at each exposure severity can be estimated by multiplying the risk of injury per exposed occupant by the number of occupants at that exposure severity. We have used a similar analysis to indicate performance differences between two hypothetical belt restraint systems. One of the belt systems would result in 33 mm of Hybrid III chest compression in a 49 km/h AV frontal barrier crash, the other, 50 mm of compression. Since our analysis is for a hypothetical vehicle model, NASS was used to provide an exposure distribution. We used NASS frontal exposure frequency as a function of reported 1892</page><page sequence="19">velocity change for the estimate of exposed occupants at each crash severity. However, each vehicle model will have a unique real world exposure distribution, depending on factors such as mass, size, driver demographics, and geographic area, Evans (1991). Hybrid III chest compression as a function of exposure severity is based on the Patrick et al. (1974) sled based Volvo study and our analysis of the various Volvo simulations. The hypothetical belt restraint system that results in 33 mm of Hybrid III chest compression in a 49 km/h AV barrier crash approximates our analysis of the Volvo data. The hypothetical belt restraint that results in 50 mm of Hybrid III chest compression in a 49 km/h AV barrier crash was assumed to exhibit 50% more Hybrid III chest compression at all test severities, than the belt restraint that resulted in 33 mm. In this hypothetical situation, the increased chest compression could be due, for instance, to upper body kinematics caused by greater pelvic forward displacement as demonstrated in Figure 1 1 . The risk of injury at each exposure severity uses the injury risk function for Hybrid III chest compression from Mertz et al. (1991) based on the APR belted occupant field study, Figure 3. Injury risk below 1% was zeroed, with a "smoothed" transition because of insufficient data to objectively define this region. The projected thoracic injury at each exposure severity is the product of NASS exposure and injury risk as plotted in Figure 13. Injury distributions by this analysis are similar to real world injury, in that injury is broadly distributed as a function of exposure severity and much of the injury is associated with low to moderate risk exposure conditions, Horsch (1987). Although the higher injury risks are strongly biased toward severe exposures, the highest incidence of crashes is strongly biased to lower severities. E &lt;o e /s ïï § i ----v.

(1991), (see Figure 3). Predicted injury frequency was determined as the risk of injury per exposed occupant multiplied by the number of exposed occupants at each exposure severity. 1893</page><page sequence="20">This results in the broad distribution of injury across the range of exposure. Comparison of injuries for the two hypothetical belt restraints indicate a difference over a broad range of exposure severities. Integration of the injury distribution provides the number of occupants having thoracic injury due to belt loading across the real world exposure range. The hypothetical system that results in 50 mm of Hybrid III chest compression in a 49 km/h AV barrier crash has a much greater number of injured occupants and has injured occupants at lower exposure severities than the system that results in 33 mm of Hybrid III chest compression. In the APR and Volvo data, most of the injury is associated with exposure severities that would result in less than 50 mm of Hybrid III chest compression. Our model demonstrates a similar trend. The injury risk associated with 50, 60 or 75 mm of Hybrid III chest compression is not the most relevant performance issue for belt systems with this level of performance. However, with other belt restraint configurations, compressions of 50 or even 75 mm might be relevant if the belt system can produce this level of chest compression in the more frequent lower severity crashes. COMBINED THORACIC LOADING - Laboratory tests with belted dummies and supplemental air bags will involve combined thoracic restraint loads. Air bags provide a more distributed thoracic load than a shoulder belt. A dummy with human-like response for combined air bag and shoulder belt loading on the upper body and measures of relevant injury modes could directly assess the injury risk for the test situation. The Hybrid III dummy represents an important improvement over the Hybrid II dummy towards achieving these objectives in both response and injury assessment measurements. Additional state-of-the-art improvements in a more human-like upper torso response for chest compression and load sharing by the shoulder and clavicle regions could refine injury assessment in laboratory tests. However, the restraint systems for many millions of vehicles will be designed with current dummies before further advanced dummies are sufficiently mature for routine assessment of automotive restraints. Using the best of mature injury assessment technology should always provide the best approach to develop restraint systems. Hybrid III chest compression provides an important insight to load sharing between the rib cage and other upper torso regions such as the shoulder. On this basis, the single compression measurement and design of the rib cage represents a significant improvement over chest acceleration, but does not provide a complete assessment of load distribution on the rib cage. In this study, we have recommended a more conservative injury risk function for belt loading than for blunt loading of the rib cage for the Hybrid III. Importantly, the Hybrid II does not provide biofidelity in response or indication of load distribution. For assessment of combined belt and air bag loading with the Hybrid III dummy, the risk function for either belt or blunt loading could apply. If 99% of the load was from the belt, then the more conservative injury risk function for belt loading would apply. If 99% of the load was from the air bag, the less conservative injury risk function for blunt loading would apply. The distributed load of the air bag compared with that of a shoulder belt suggests a lower injury risk for a given load if more of the restraining load is by the air bag than by the shoulder belt, particularly in severe crashes and for lower tolerance occupants. The ratio of restraining forces will depend not only on the vehicle design, but also on such factors as occupant size and seat adjustment. Limiting shoulder belt tension might be a method to influence the relative loading. We have not directly addressed thoracic injury assessment for combined loading for the Hybrid III. Both blunt and belt loads cause rib cage deformation which can result in fractures away from the loaded region. Injury risk assessment can probably be based on blunt loading for this injury mode. Additionally, rib fractures tend to follow the belt path due to a more concentrated belt load compared with blunt loading. Injury risk 1894</page><page sequence="21">assessment should probably be based on belt loading for this injury mode. The relative amount of restraint by the shoulder belt and air bag cannot be directly determined from Hybrid III responses. However, shoulder belt tension does provide a measure of restraint by the shoulder belt. Our analysis of various studies has demonstrated a relationship of shoulder belt tension with Hybrid III chest compression. Thus, if the relationship between shoulder belt tension and Hybrid III chest compression is known for a particular belt restraint, then the relative loading of the rib cage by each restraint can be estimated. One assessment strategy might be based on the blunt injury risk assessment for Hybrid III chest compression while independently considering the influence of belt loading from shoulder belt tension and its relationship with Hybrid III chest compression for that belt restraint. This would allow the application of the injury risk function for belt loading in combination with the blunt injury risk assessment. SUMMARY Chest compression is one of the vital responses for development of restraint systems. This response directly relates to loading of the rib cage and the risk of serious or fatal injury to the heart and lungs protected by the rib cage. The "tolerable" loading of the upper body is more than twice that of the rib cage alone. The chest compression response of the Hybrid III provides an objective measure of this important aspect of torso load distribution for blunt loading. Our analysis indicates that the chest compression of the Hybrid III dummy is important for belt restraint if an appropriate injury risk relationship is used. We found similar estimates of thoracic injury risk as a function of chest compression based on two in depth studies of crashes involving belted car occupants. An exposure severity that results in 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression would have a 20-25% risk of an AIS&gt;3 thoracic injury for car occupants. Importantly, the field experience of APR and Volvo indicate that crashes severe enough to result in greater than 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression are infrequent and that injuries in these classic field studies are mostly associated with crash severities which would result in less than 40 mm of Hybrid III chest compression.
