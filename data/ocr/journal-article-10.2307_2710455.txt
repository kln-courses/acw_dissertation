<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT DETWEILER University of Florida Emerson and Zen BECAUSE OF HIS REPUTATION AS AN AMERICAN ORACLE, RALPH WALDO EMERSON has also come to serve as an occasional measuring device for the native compatibility of the various vogues of religion, philosophy or political doctrine which invade our culture from time to time. If Emerson was (as Carl F. Strauch has stated) "the literary middleman of the nineteenth century," he is just as legitimately to our age a familiar source or at least a point of reference to whom we return, periodically, to assess the foreign elements demanding a specifically American reinterpretation. Thus in the last thirty years alone the Emersonian mystique has provided an indigenous testing ground for the premises of Marxist dialectics, German national socialism, Oriental mysticism (repeatedly and with reference to its various forms) and lately, post-World War II atheistic and Christian existentialism. I am only following a tradition of American scholarship, therefore, in attempting to define the relationship of Emerson to Zen Buddhism and to evaluate the significance of that philosophy-faith for our culture from the perspective of our first uniquely American poet-seer. The idea is not my own. In his article "Current Western Interest in Zen," printed in Philosophy East and West, Van Meter Ames makes occasional comparisons between modern Zen and the Emersonian attitude as a means of demonstrating the reasons inherent in the recent popular espousal of the Japanese sect by the West.1 I intend to examine a number of the more significant similarities between Emerson and Zen, especially as they affect the Emersonian ontology, and on the basis of the results venture an opinion on the relevance of Zen for the American with his heritage of self-reliance, accessibility of divine truth and trust in an ultimate benevolence of Nature and God. It is necessary first to check the remote possibility of Emerson's own first-hand acquaintance with Zen. It is common knowledge that he was attracted to Buddhism, but the degree of its influence upon him has 1 Van Meter Ames, "Current Western Interest in Zen," Philosophy East and West, X (April-July 1960), 23-33.</page><page sequence="2">Emerson &amp; Zen 423 remained largely undetermined. The two classical works on Emerson and Oriental thought, Arthur Christy's The Orient in American Transcen- dentalism and F. I. Carpenter's Emerson and Asia, offer only incidental aid.2 Yet on the basis of their information alone, one learns that Emer- son's actual knowledge of Buddhism was probably even sketchier than the available source material. At one place, for example, he identifies the Bhagavad Gita as "the much renowned book of Buddhism" (a con- fusion common to the Transcendentalists, perhaps, since Thoreau also identified Buddhism with Brahmanism) and, as Carpenter informs us, his observations on Buddhism were limited to the popular concepts of fate, quietism and Nirvana. This information, therefore, practically pre- cludes any possibility that Emerson may have known Zen itself. Apart from the fact that none of the teachings of the early Zen masters was translated into English during Emerson's lifetime (or into any European language, for that matter), his restricted reading in Buddhistic thought of any kind makes it quite unlikely that he was ever confronted with the interpretations peculiar to the Zen school. Any comparison, as a result, will have to be on the basis of purely intellectual or experiential similar- ity and without the support of historical correspondence. At the same time, one can point to a surprising resemblance between the historical development of Zen and Emerson's version of New England Transcendentalism, a discussion of which will bring us to a consideration of individual relationships between the two. Older Zen, rejecting the Theravada (Hinayanist) ideal of individual release in favor of the world- inclusive Nirvana of the Mahayanist Bodhisattva (ideal man), then in disavowing the isolation of transcendental Nirvana in favor of an "exis- tential" day-by-day experience, came to represent a decidedly left-wing, iconoclastic branch of the traditional Northern School of Buddhism. Ames introduces a comparison with the New England religious situation of Emerson's day with the statement that "Zen seems to mean a rejection of traditional Buddhism like the Unitarian rejection of traditional Chris- tianity, while at the same time keeping the tradition, to reinterpret it in a more naturalistic and humanistic way, as in Emerson." 8 I do not 2 Arthur Christy, The Orient in American Transcendentalism (New York, 1932); Frederic Ives Carpenter, Emerson and Asia (Cambridge, 1930). The appendix in Christy's book listing the Oriental readings of the Transcendentalists is quite valuable. However, I found only four or five entries relating Emerson and Buddhism, and all of these but one were concerned with insignificant aspects of Buddhism. The one exception, Max Mueller's Lectures on the Science of Religion, which contained a section on Nirvana and Buddhist nihilism, did not appear until 1872 and was therefore too late to influence the corpus of Emerson's writings. Similarly, in checking Ralph Waldo Emerson's Reading by Kenneth Cameron (Raleigh, N. C., 1941), I have been unable to discover any entries which would indicate a deeper acquaintance of Emerson with Buddhism. 3 Ames, pp. 30-31.</page><page sequence="3">424 American Quarterly think that this observation carries the details of the comparison nearly far enough. In the first place, for whatever the parallel may be worth, modern Zen is not only a "rejection of traditional Buddhism"; it is a development of a liberalizing movement within the ancient orthodox Mahayana and one of the five divisions resulting from the liberal im- pulse. But beyond that, there was a major schism within the Zen sect itself, producing a Northern and Southern Branch (not to be confused with the original Northern and Southern Schools of Buddhism) and lead- ing ultimately to the dominance of the Southern Branch with its doctrine of Sudden Enlightenment as opposed to the Gradual Enlightenment of the Northern, imperially supported Branch. This Southern Branch, dis- counting other divisions mainly social and geographic, is represented in present-day Japanese Zen. Similarly, the Transcendentalism that Emerson represented during the middle period of his life was also an extreme modification and liberalization of the existing Unitarianism which had already established the lines of its anti-Calvinist protest and settled into a kind of orthodoxy of its own. More significant are the analogous direc- tions which Zen and Emersonian Transcendentalism took in their depar- tures from the traditional positions. Both, for example, were extremely suspicious of the externals comprising so much of the old system and became dedicated to the task of ridding their thinking of the dead weight of the past. Both, in line with the process of de-externalization, put forth special efforts to destroy anthropomorphic concepts of deity. Both con- centrated much less on speculation regarding the nature of God, extremely important to the systems from whence they emerged, and emphasized instead the experiential process whereby one could find and unite with God. Both, finally, worked to eliminate whatever vestiges of a transcen- dent-immanent as well as of a good-evil dualism still existed within the structure of their world views and sharpened instead the monistic view of an ontic-cosmic unity inherent in their efforts to become one with the all. These general historical parallels should indicate more specific cor- respondences within the philosophical-religious framework, and I intend to point out a number of these in the next pages.4 First, both Emerson and Zen have two similar concepts forming the foundation of their ontologies: God or Buddha as the One Mind, and the unity of the one 4 The difficulty in explicating Zen, of course, is that the interpreter finds himself in the embarrassing position of trying to work with a system (or nonsystem) that by its very nature denies and defies the possibility of explication. Yet even Suzuki, who prefaces his books and lectures with a note on the impossibility of discussing Zen, has managed to write and speak profusely on the subject. Therefore-to adapt Suzuki's way of stating the problem-if one cannot talk Zen, one can at least speak respectfully about it and convey thereby as much of its essence as the intellect can grasp.</page><page sequence="4">Emerson &amp; Zen 425 and all which is basically God or Buddha. Blofeld states in his introduc- tion to the Huang Po sermons that "Zen followers . . . prefer to talk of 'the Absolute' or 'the One Mind', for which they employ many synonyms according to the aspect to be emphasized in relation to something finite." 5 To Huang Po himself are attributed the words: All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing but the One Mind, beside which nothing exists. This mind, which is without beginning, is unborn and indestructible. . . . The One Mind alone is the Buddha, and there is no distinction between the Buddha and sentient things, but that sentient beings are attached to forms and so seek externally for Buddhahood.6 This stress upon God-as-Mind is very like Emerson's emphasis. One of his primary designation for deity is Mind, with various adjectives preced- ing the appellation, such as "Supreme," "Great," "Universal." In addi- tion, one finds in Emerson as in Zen an astonishing number of synonyms for God-as-Mind, each attempting to express some facet of the concept relating to the particular element of existence under immediate discus- sion. In Emerson's early popular essays after 1836 and in the Essays: First Series alone one finds at least twenty terms equivalent to the concept of God-as-Mind. Note, as examples, the similarity to the Zen terminology and to its efforts to capture the multiplexity in simplicity of Buddha-as- Mind in three quotations from Emerson. Writing in the "Divinity School Address" and commenting upon evidences of morality in the universe, he states that "These facts have always suggested to man the sublime creed that the world is not the product of manifold power, but of one will, of one mind; and that one mind is everywhere active." 7 In "His- tory" he writes that "There is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. . . . Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent." 8 And speaking to the subject of "Modern Literature" he asserts the same idea: "Another element of the modern poetry akin to this subjective tendency, or rather the direc- tion of that same on the question of resources, is the Feeling of the Infinite. Of the perception now fast becoming a conscious fact,-that there is One Mind...." 9 Significantly, for both Zen and Emerson, 5 John Blofeld, The Zen Teaching of Huang Po (New York, 1959), p. 16. 6 Blofeld, P. 29. 7 Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Complete Works, Centenary Edition (New York and Boston, 1903), I, 123.

The concept in itself comes to serve as a synonym for God or Buddha and can in many in- stances be equated with "essence" or "being"; as such it accentuates the will-ing, ordering and knowing aspects of deity. In Zen, this all-inclu- siveness of Mind as being has its roots as deep as in the idealism of the earliest Indian Buddhism. In Emerson, it is the result of the centrality of mind as he found it in Plato, Plotinus, in the much later German transcendental idealism and, of course, in Orientalism itself. The second ontological foundation, the unity of the one and the many, receives analogous treatment in the two philosophies also. Zen teaches distinctly the doctrine of sunyata: that all separate things are empty in themselves, that the variety of existence has no meaning or reality except as the many modes and forms of existence are understood to be mani- festations of the one Buddha-nature. Suzuki, certainly the most articulate exponent and interpreter of modern Zen to the Western world, illustrates the Buddha-infusion of all things in the recording of a dialogue between the Master Gensha and a monk: A monk asked: "What is the One?" G.: "The many." M.: "What is the many?" G.: "The One!" M.: "What is the Buddha-mind?" G.: "The mind of sentient beings." M.: "What is the mind of sentient beings?" G.: "The Buddha-mind." 10 Compare this to the statement by Emerson in "The Sovereignty of Ethics" that "God is one and omnipresent; here or nowhere is the whole fact. The one miracle which God works evermore is in Nature, and imparting himself to the mind." 11 There is probably a final difference between Zen and Emerson in this aspect, but it resolves itself into a matter of degree. In Zen, the Buddha-infusion of all results in a complete inter- changeability of all components of existence and in an absolute denial of any transcendental mode of being by Buddha. Buddha is not only found in this or that thing; he is the thing. Thus there is the total iden- tity of mind and matter and, negatively, the sunyata-the impermanence and unreality of all individual forms-until they reach the "suchness" of the Buddha-nature. Emerson would not go so far. In spite of his insist- ence upon the presence of God "in every moss and cobweb," he can never complete the equation, either intellectually or experientially.

More important for the purpose of contrast with Zen, Emerson cannot participate spiritually in the identity of God and all because he has neither the whole constitution nor the method of the mystic that would enable him to do so. He cannot really move beyond the dichotomy of subject and object (beyond "con- ceptualizing," Suzuki would say), although he can talk about it and "metaphorize" on it, and thus he never experiences the merging of his personality with that of deity. Nevertheless, since I am still pointing out similarities, it is necessary to state that the direction of the two sys- tems regarding the one and the many is the same. Emerson may not have carried the concept to its natural conclusion, as in Zen, but at least he tried during his Transcendental period, and even after that, having missed the mystic vision, he retained the idea as a vital element of his later idealistic naturalism. Before leaving the subject, one should notice yet a secondary effect of the doctrine of the one and the many conspicuous in Zen and Emerson. Since all life, all being, is Buddha, or since all life is infused with God, there is nothing that should not be revered and nothing that is evil in itself or by its nature. As Watts expresses it; For the first principle of the Mahayana is that all things, however vile on the surface and however insignificant, are aspects of the Buddha- nature, and this implies that every being and thing must be accepted; nothing can be excluded from the "Lotus Land of Purity" as being "worldly" or "trivial" or "base." 12 Therefore when the Zen pupil is asked to reply to his master, in a typical mondo, concerning the mysteries of the Buddha-nature, his best answer will be a simple reference to " 'The cypress tree in the courtyard!' 'The bamboo grove at the foot of the hill!' 'The dried up dirt scraper!'" 13 Emerson uses much the same technique, with the same philosophy behind it, when he tries to shock the conservative intellect into accepting the God-ness of all by asking, "What is there of the divine in a load of bricks? What is there of the divine in a barber's shop or a privy? Much. All." 14 These metaphysical elements, evidencing an unusual degree of similar- ity in their expression within the two systems, are only the background for the real concern. Zen as well as Emerson wishes above all to convert 12 Alan W. Watts, The Spirit of Zen (New York, 1958), pp. 47-48. 13 Watts, p. 56. 14 The Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson, eds. William H.

Both, moreover, are exis- tential in the modern sense of the word in that, although they utilize the mind as the vehicle for contemplating reality, they are intent on moving beyond the cognitive process to encounter being and becoming with the total personality. I see three areas in which Zen and Emerson alike work to accomplish their goal of transcending the nonbeing of a purely conformist, sense- or logic-dictated life: in the underlying attitude of self-reliance, the intui- tional experience and the miracle of the here and now. Speaking first to the theme of self-reliance, I find that Zen and Emerson correspond in their insistence that the strictures of the past be set aside; that self- reliance, properly understood, is a dependence upon the deity within one; and that the "existential leap" (Suzuki quoting Kierkegaard) or "the courage to be" will be rewarded by the emergence of one's new being, which is in Zen the Enlightenment of satori and in Emerson the serenity that comes with the realization of one's existing in "the Aborig- inal Self" or in "the lap of immense intelligence." Suzuki, by referring to the limitations of the Christian view, demonstrates that the accumu- lated knowledge of one's tradition must be thrown off before satori or ''seeing into one's nature" is realized: Christians take God and his light as things irrevocable, imperatively imposed upon them, and start their work of salvation under these limi- tations. Their "knowledge" always clings to them, they cannot shake this shackle off; they become victims of logic and rationality. Logic and rationality are all very well, Buddhists say, but the real spiritual abode, according to Buddhists, is found only where logic and rationality have not yet made their start.15 The tenor of this paragraph is much like the contentions of Emerson in "The American Scholar" or the "Divinity School Address" that men have become enslaved to books, to past scholarship or to formal credenda when they actually "can read God directly," trust their own spontaneous thoughts, and realize the incarnation of God in each of them instead of in one (Christ) alone. We shall see later that a fundamental difference exists here, since Zen goes beyond cognition per se and of any period, even beyond one's present rational insights, whereas Emerson protests mainly against the canonization of thought falsely hallowed by age but encourages faith in the individual intellect; but for the time being it is enough to note that the key to self-reliance, in both systems, is a con- 15 Suzuki, p. 71.</page><page sequence="8">Emerson &amp; Zen 429 centration upon one's inherent powers instead of upon an alien frame- work of thought. I have already pointed to the divine basis of self-reliance in discussing the Zen and Emersonian ideas of the one and the many. God is in all things and constitutes all things, but he reaches a unique stage of im- manence in man, because man is the only creature who is conscious of him. Suzuki illustrates the singularity of man's position by comparing his Zen existence to the Zen life of a dog-a drastic analogy for the Eastern mind. The dog harbors the divine within itself but has no self- awareness and therefore cannot awaken to the Buddha-nature that inhabits it. It is man alone that can live by Zen as well as live Zen. To live Zen is not enough; we must live by it, which means that we must have the consciousness of living it, although this consciousness is beyond what we generally understand by it. The latter is relative and psychological while the consciousness of living Zen is something qualitatively differ- ent from it; it marks the limit of development which the human mind can achieve; it almost approaches divine consciousness.'6 Emerson would-and does-say essentially the same thing, especially in some of the later sermons preached toward the end of his Second Church period. Nature for him, infused as it is by deity, is a mute witness of the God it contains, but it remains for man, in whom intellect (correspond- ing here to Suzuki's self-awareness) resides to interpret the deity mani- fested therein. His emphasis, however, is on the realization of and result- ant action upon the divinity within one. This is the theme of "Self- Reliance": What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded?. . . the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed. . . . We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity." 17 For Emerson, as for the Zen Buddhist, the consciousness of divinity immanent in man and in the world about him forms the real foundation of self-trust. The final element of self-reliance, in which self-reliance realizes itself, is the existential faith present both in Zen and in Emersonian Tran- scendentalism and leading in each instance to the transformation of the 16 Suzuki, p. 12. 17 Works, II, 63-64.</page><page sequence="9">430 American Quarterly individual consciousness into a new stage of being (or, in existential terminology, into "being" itself). Since this process centers upon the second area instrumental in the Zen and Emersonian systems of over- coming nonbeing, namely, around the intuitional experience, I will discuss it in connection with that idea. In Zen, the intellect, while functioning as the factor in the human con- stitution whereby man can live consciously by Zen, is not allowed to dominate man's existence but is made to serve the total personality until that personality unites with the superconsciousness through satori. In an endeavor analogous to the function of the Old Testament law as the schoolmaster leading to Christ, the Zen intellect is buffeted, confused and forced to such absurd exaggerations of its own nature that the indi- vidual is finally led to admit the helplessness of rationality in solving the dilemma of life (which, in Zen, would be the impossibility of reach- ing Nirvana through logic) and to look for some sort of nonrational aid. That aid is found in the intuition. Suzuki writes in great detail regarding intuition and its relation to the satori experience. He describes the satori, or the Enlightenment of the Zen believer, as an act in which one transcends conceptualization and faces reality directly without even the mediation of the structuring mind. Properly speaking, this is not intui- tion or even the work of some faculty in man called the intuition, be- cause intuition implies that there is a two-ness of being and that one must employ the intuitive process to participate in unity. Suzuki insists that "There have never been two from the very first. It was the human act of knowing that God divided himself and came to be conscious of himself as not God and yet God. . . Here we cannot talk about intuition or identification; there is only an absolute state of self- identity." 18 He attempts to make the idea clear to the Western mentality by comparing the experience to the non-dialectical encounter of Kier- kegaard with reality, but here, I believe, he out-existentializes the Dane. Kierkegaard, in reaction to the artificial logic of Hegel, certainly meant to modify the preoccupation with the epistemological process (a heritage of Kant) in favor of the demands of ontology, but I do not think that he tried to achieve the identity of knowing and being that is the essence of Suzuki's satori; he simply wished to bring the human intellect to the point where it could be grasped by the supreme otherness of God. Suzuki, on the other hand, goes on to define satori as "dynamic intuition," and "dynamic" here is the key term: Satori is intuition dynamically conceived. When you move with a mov- ing object, when you are identified with it, and yet when you are not 18 Suzuki, pp. 50-51</page><page sequence="10">Emerson &amp; Zen 431 moving at all, a certain state of consciousness-super-consciousness- prevails, which is satori.19 Intuition for the Zen Buddhist, then, is not a process or a faculty. It is an experience, the experience that identifies man consciously with God. How does Emerson's concept of intuition compare with this? First, it seems that Emerson's concept of God-as-Mind surpassed his idea of God- as-Unity to the extent that he could not ever really bring himself to abandon intellect as the basic component of reality. He learned his doc- trine of intuition, misunderstood though it was, from Kant through Coleridge, and came to attribute thereby the ordinary exercises of the mind to the faculty of Understanding and the "super-thoughts" (in Kant simply the a priori structure of the mind) to what he called Reason. It is this Reason which Emerson equates with intuition. Significantly, how- ever, the Reason never supersedes conceptualization. The ideas or feel- ings it intuits, too high for the Understanding, are finally thoughts in the mind of God; divine revelation is really only the knowledge that any man can have by allowing the deity within him to express itself. Intui- tion for Emerson, therefore, is not extrarationality, as in Zen; it is super- rationality: a difference of degree, not of quality. Nevertheless, Emerson travels in the same direction as Zen in employing something greater than the normal reasoning powers in trying to experience reality, and what- ever the ultimate essence of reality, he undergoes an experience akin to the mysticism of Zen in meeting it. It is immediate and instantaneous, like the Sudden Enlightenment of satori; it is stimulated by profound contemplation of nature and sensory objects, at least somewhat like the samadhi (total contemplation) of Zen; it includes an acute, sharpened consciousness of being which is similar to the dynamic intuition state of Zen; and it leaves one with the peace and serenity of nearness to deity approaching the conscious assumption of the Buddha-nature in Zen. These characteristics, components of the mystical experience, are re- peatedly mentioned by Emerson in his writings from the Transcendental period. Thus, in his well-known description of the forest experience in the 1836 Nature, he writes: In the woods, we return to reason and faith. . Standing on the bare ground,-my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space,-all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God.20 And in "Self-Reliance," he gives a slightly more intellectualized account: 19 Suzuki, p. 87. 20 Works, I, 10.</page><page sequence="11">432 American Quarterly And now at last the highest truth on this subject [self-reliance] remains unsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off re- membering of the intuition. . . . The soul raised over passion be- holds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well.21 Intuition, therefore, for Zen and Emerson alike is the means of obtaining spiritual satisfaction where the usual powers of intellect do not suffice. Lastly, in helping man cope with his problems of existence, both Zen and Emerson emphasize the miracle of the here and now. It was on pre- cisely this point, in fact, that Zen broke with traditional Buddhism. Zen does not wish to achieve a Nirvana that will remove the individual from the fullness of life around him, nor does it teach the believer to look forward to a space-and-time transcending state of nothingness (tradi- tional Nirvana) which frees one from karma and samsara (the alterna- tion of birth and death). Instead, it encourages the individual to achieve a Nirvana in the present through satori. "Enlightenment," Suzuki says, "consists in spiritually elucidating facts of experience and not in denying or abnegating them." He goes on to explain the significance of the active Zen life by contrasting it with the Christian view: What distinguishes Christianity from Buddhism, in one respect at least and in the deepest way, is in their way of interpreting miracles. With Buddhists, especially with Zen followers, their life is a series of miracles. They do not perform them at a certain specified place and in a certain specified time, as Christ did. . . . Christians cannot go any further than these deeds of Christ; they cannot transform their whole life into one grand miracle.22 Zen overcomes the need to transcend the strictures of a time-and-space limited existence not only through the constant consciousness of the wonder of life but through another means as well. Through satori, the conscious participation in the complete unity with deity, the Zen follower is released from the prison of relativity. Suzuki explains the emancipa- tion by referring to eternity in relation to satori: Each moment of living marks the steps of eternity. To take hold of eternity, therefore, consciousness must be awakened just at the very moment when eternity lifts its feet to step into time. This moment is what is known as the "absolute present" or "eternal now". It is an abso- lute point of time where there is no past left behind, no future waiting ahead. Satori stands at this point, where potentialities are about to 21 Works, II, 68-69. 22 Suzuki, p. 49.</page><page sequence="12">Emerson &amp; Zen 433 actualize themselves. Satori does not come out of death; it is at the very moment of actualization.23 Zen thus replaces the void of the traditional Nirvana with absolute being and the believer becomes filled with the immediate whole instead of striving for the nonexistence beyond samsara. Emerson refers likewise both to the miracle of immediate life and to the significance of the present. The main point of his argument in the famous miracle controversy of 1838 with Andrews Norton and other Unitarians, in fact, was that the Unitarian-Christian view limited un- necessarily the concept of the miraculous to a historical time and place. He expressed his view quite unequivocally in the "Divinity School Ad- dress," in which he interpreted Jesus' attitude toward the wondrous in terms of his own view: He [Christ] spoke of miracles; for he felt that man's life was a miracle, and all that man doth, and he knew that this daily miracle shines as the character ascends. But the word Miracle, as pronounced by Chris- tian churches, gives a false impression: it is Monster. It is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain.24 The indictment of Christianity by Zen and Emerson on this point is identical and has the same basis: all of nature, of life, is pervaded with deity and must therefore partake of the miraculous, the supernatural. But Emerson's view corresponds to the attitude of Zen also in his lack of concern regarding the possibility or nature of an afterlife and in con- centrating rather upon the present (see, for example, his essay on "Im- mortality"). The emphasis is inherent in his rejection of the past and in his refusal to speculate upon the future. More than this, while his thought on the freedom from the relativity of time and space may not be as sophisticated as Suzuki's, he nonetheless is thinking obviously along the same lines. In his struggle to fit the idea of fate into his picture of uni- fied existence, he emerges with a solution that is essentially the same as that of Zen: that through identifying oneself with deity, one can over- come time-and-spaceness (birth-and-death in Zen) and live in the infinite present. A journal entry from 1859 reveals an amazing similarity with Zen doctrine on this point and deserves to be quoted in detail: Our doctrine must begin with the necessary and eternal, and dis- criminate Fate from the necessary; there is no limitation about the Eternal. Thought, Will, is co-eternal with the world; and, as soon as intellect is awaked in any man, it shares so far of the eternity,-is of the maker, not of the made. But Fate is the name we give to the action 23 Suzuki, pp. 54-55. 24 Works, I, 129.</page><page sequence="13">434 American Quarterly of that one eternal, all various necessity on the brute myriads, whether in things, animals, or in men in whom the intellect pore is not yet opened. . . The great day in the man is the birth of perception, which instantly throws him on the party of the Eternal. He sees what must be. . . . To be then becomes the infinite good.... 25 If one substitutes karma or samsara for Fate, Buddha-nature for the necessary, and satori for intellect in this quotation, it could just as well come from a Zen source. As it is, Emerson in his own right provides a means of overcoming nonbeing that is in perfect alignment with his concept of God-as-Mind and with his concern for developing the total personality through encounter with the superrationality of deity. There are other important parallels between Zen and Emerson that might be examined. In the area of soteriology, for example, one finds that each system has certain world-saving tendencies, resulting from the concept of unified existence, which give the enlightened individual a distinct responsibility toward his fellows but which simultaneously pro- duce a quietism grounded upon the belief that the God in all will work in the creatures he inhabits.26 From the standpoint of aesthetics, there appear so many similarities in the use of symbols and presentational language to express reality that a discussion of the subject would call for a separate study. I believe, however, that I have presented enough cor- respondences to indicate the essential relationship of the two philos- ophies. It remains now to point out a few of the basic differences and then to comment upon the implications of such a study for an under- standing of American culture. Two of the main differences have already been hinted at. First, there is a diversity of attitude and emphasis in metaphysical speculation. Zen does not care to define the nature of reality beyond stating that God is in all and in each. It is reluctant to discuss ontology because discussion can lead only to intellectualization and therefore away from the central satori experience. Emerson, even when stressing intuition, remains anchored in intellect because his God-and reality itself-is essentially Mind, so that he is persistently curious.27 This difference becomes 25 The Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson, eds.

In traditional Buddhism, the achieve- ment of Nirvana as Nothingness was strictly a personal affair. In Calvinism, the doctrine of predestination led to an overriding concern for the condition of one's own soul. 27 Late in his career, Emerson could still declare, "I believe the mind is the creator of the world, and is ever creating;-that at last matter is dead Mind; that mind makes the senses it sees with; that the genius of man is a continuation of the power that made him and that has not done making him."

Zen turns ultimately antimind while Emerson places more and more of his faith in intellect. The distinction is particularly evident in the Zen koan. The koan is the purposeful attempt of the Zen master to confound the logical work- ings of the mind of his pupil and to precipitate thereby the redeeming flash of insight, the Enlightenment of satori. Emerson, in contrast, con- siders any obstructions to the intellect as the result of man's separation from the divine mind which must be overcome by deeper concentration or by the contemplation of nature which will produce the new facts necessary to a further comprehension of life. The intuitional experience of Zen brings about immediate, lasting identity with being. The intui- tional experience of Emerson, at best a superrational activity, is an in- cessant becoming, with the occasional intermittent achievement of unity but never the realization of the ultimate identity. It is precisely at this point, in fact, that the practical difference emerges. Zen is apparently a system that provides a satisfying, workable answer to life for its con- verts. Emerson, in spite of his lifelong search for the total experience of peace, of truth or of God, never really arrived. His period of Transcen- dentalism, from which most of the materials for comparison have been taken, is only a chapter in the record of his search and represents a direction which he abandoned or at least modified when the mystical experiences did not last and when the permanent experience of unity through the methods it provided was not forthcoming. This is not to say that his life or even his method was a failure. It does mean, however, that Emerson was finally unlike Zen in that his life and method remained necessarily unfinished business, and in that his later acquiescence, de- scribed so well by Whicher in Freedom and Fate, was not, as in Zen, the great Enlightenment that made him one with being but the admission that natural forces were too great for the individual ego. They could not be commanded, often not comprehended, but only accepted as semisecrets in the mind of God that had to be studied to find further truth. And thus, while Zen exults in the daily Nirvana, Emerson went back to his "one fact a year," to adding more dots to the arc of the circle: usually serene, but still always the seeker.28 28 Nor did he ever really abandon completely his trust in intuition. Somewhat older and wiser in the essay on "Experience," he can still write, "What help from thought? Life is not dialectics. . . . The great gifts are not got by analysis. Everything good is on the highway. The middle region of our being is the temperate zone. We may climb into the thin and cold realm of pure geometry and lifeless science, or sink into that of sensation. Between these extremes is the equator of life, of thought, of spirit, of poetry,-a narrow belt."

Looking first at the value of Zen for understanding Emerson, one could say that Zen indicates a way that Emerson might naturally have taken at one stage of his career. Most of the elements of Zen were already present in his system: the drive toward unity, the concern for the present, the love of nature, reverence for life, faith in oneself and a passion for totality. Be- yond these, it is beginning to appear as though he was also temperamen- tally ready for a belief in something like Zen. The persistent stereotype of Emerson as the calm ethereal seer, the thinker and inspirer of higher thoughts alone, is gradually fading out and he is emerging instead (through the publication of the new, uncensored Journals and through critical analyses such as those of Strauch and Whicher) as the man of normal human emotions, biases, doubts and fears-as a man, in fact, in whom those inner doubts and fears, as his psychological reaction to the formal arguments of an imported idealism or native Puritanism, led him for a good decade of his life to look for salvation in the super- rational. Had it been the extrarational instead, the direction of American intellectual development might have been altered. Viewing the relationship from another angle, one sees grounds for advising the Western followers of Zen to take a long, hard look at Emerson. In him they may find, in native dress but just as attractive, much of what seems to be the exotic new truth from the East. Members of the bearded set in the Greenwich Village coffee houses have long recognized Whitman as a brother in the faith and have quoted his poetry as the expression of American rebellion but also, simultaneously, as the product of inherent American genius. Now they would do well to go back to Whitman's teacher and inspirer and catch the spirit of the orig- inal rebellion and genius as it fought its way to artistic and philosophic coherence through the strictures of the just-as-inherent American ortho- doxy and conservative common sense. Or for the frustrated intellectual drawn to Zen less by the iconoclastic impulse than by the desire to find a meditative peace, Emerson can act as the Virgil who, himself confined to a noble existence in the limbo of the unsatisfied mind, will guide the believer at least to the purgatorio of koan, from whence he can find his way to the paradiso of satori. The statements indicate the tenor of my final analysis. There is apparently something missing in modern American thought: something that Emerson had-or almost had-and lost and something that Zen has to offer. Ames makes two statements in his article bearing upon this missing element. He says first that</page><page sequence="16">Emerson &amp; Zen 437 Americans can learn from Zen what some of their own teachers have taught them: to trust themselves, to be at home in their world, and to have confidence that they can solve their problems, without worrying about theological questions and metaphysical puzzles.29 And two pages further he states: The secret of the fascination of Zen lies in its combination of the intellectual and the intuitive, or, rather, in its intellectual justification of the intuitive.30 I am not sure that Ames makes his point. The question that still remains is: "What is the intuition?" It is the problem that causes the fundamental difference between Zen and Emerson; it is the problem that troubled Emerson throughout his life; it is one of the main problems that has troubled American thought ever since the age of Emerson. Emerson became the victim of the nineteenth-century scientific trend with its accompanying current of skepticism and its philosophic embodiment in the new positivism. In spite of his "cosmic optimism," he received little comfort in the later years of his life through the realization that the intellect he had championed was moving further away from a compre- hension of the mind of God and that the evolutionary process as it applied to the development of mind was not filling in the dots in the arc of the circle but was beginning instead to deny the existence of the circle at all or at least the possibility of ever learning its boundaries. William James, himself a student of Emerson, destroyed whatever super- intellectual elements remained in the Emersonian concept of intuition by identifying it as part of the psychological process, subject to scientific examination and definition. During the ensuing long, lean years of positivistic dominance in American thought, the notion of intuition was either ignored altogether or treated as an outmoded epistemological curiosity, in line with the de-emphasis of metaphysics as a whole. Now that the principle of relativity has been employed to revitalize meta- physical interest (through the writings of Whitehead, for example), intuition is again coming into its own. Hence the climate is favorable for renewed sympathetic interest in Emerson as it is for the growth of Zen. The crux of the problem now for Zen is in how it will relate itself to American culture: whether or not it can make "its intellectual justi- fication of the intuitive" really palatable to the Western mind. Emerson has already found a modern interpreter in Paul Tillich, whose divine Logos as the God above the God of theism unites intuition and mind in the Christian existential act of faith, and whose total theological-philo- 29 Ames, P. 27. 30 Ames, p. 29.</page><page sequence="17">438 American Quarterly sophical-cultural system provides the most natural Western answer to Emerson's search. Whether Zen can find its own Western paraclete or whether it can convince the American mentality through the force and integrity of its unique Oriental nature may determine the quality and degree of success it will enjoy in this country. In any instance, students of Emerson will watch Zen for new insights it may provide on under- standing their subject, while followers of Zen should profit from a study of one who shared much of their spirit without ever discovering their form.</page></plain_text>
