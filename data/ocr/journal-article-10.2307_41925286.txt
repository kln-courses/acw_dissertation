<plain_text><page sequence="1">"'Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution": Byron's Poetry and Mimetic Desire Ian Dennis University of Ottawa 1. Introduction HI re all know Lord Byron, I presume. Know him as a paradigmatic J object of cultural desire, as the quintessentially romantic individual- T T ist whose haughtily transgressive rejection of his society turned him into one of its most compelling models and objects, the endlessly provocative rival of a multitude of young men to follow - and they are still following - all to differing degrees blind to or writhing in the anxieties of his influence. I myself belong to that somewhat smaller group that actually reads his poetry. Having passed through the little deification of celebrity, Byron was on something of a downslope of fame, and knew it, before he put the matter past all doubt by dying almost-young for liberty in Greece in 1824. Perhaps not surprisingly, given all this, he developed into something of an expert on desire. Almost alone among the major Romantics, he came to understand this most basic force in human experience not only as mediated and mimetic but as increasingly a function of a new kind of market whose commanding value was apparent autonomy from the market. It is not too hard to see how he figured this out. Those whom Byron defied adored him; those whose petty gratifica- tions he evaded in spectacular suffering emulated him; those to whose desires he declared himself indifferent desired him - as few have ever been desired. For all his very real faults he was an intelligent man and an observant one. He reflected on what had happened to him. 2. Reading Byron's Poetry for Nature and Desire In his earlier poetry the natural scene, at least in Byron's privileged experiences of it, acts as an ally against other people. It is a source of his difference from and thus his indifference to the rest of us - an apparent replacement for, rather than object of, mediated desire. © Contagion: Journal of Violence, Mimesis, and Culture Vol. 12-13, 2006, pp. 115-132 ISSN 1075-7201</page><page sequence="2">116 Ian Dennis Almost the first words of the preface to his fame-making Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812) tell us that the poem was "written, for the most part, amidst the scenes which it attempts to describe" and a coy disquisition on the iden- tity of the Childe - who is and is not Byron - follows close on the heels of a spate of place-name dropping. They are sexy places, too, hard to get to, exotic, naturally beautiful, and dangerous. Soon the note of human pollution is of course sounded - man "mars" the beauties of Cintra that the hero is experienc- ing (1980-1993, 1.15)1 - reminding us of the prototypical alliance between the alienated Romantic solitary and the unspoiled, or spoiled natural world, alike menaced by sociality, by the Other. This alliance is powerfully reinforced by an identification with the bovine victim of the Cadiz bull-ring, vivid sacri- fice at the center of - in the young poet's chilling phrase - "the silent circle's peopled walls" (1.75). Does man scapegoat nature? There could hardly be a handier metaphor. And the Childe makes common cause. Mainly, though, "Dear Nature" is the particular solace of her "never- wean'd" favorite son, the one who never "pollutes her path," he who, as he rather complacently notes, "mark'd her when none other hath" (2.27). Byron does at least make good on such a claim by going to Albania, a wild, inacces- sible place which he, with some justification, boasts "all admire, but many dread to view" (2.43). He writes some stirring descriptive poetry, leavened with occasional homilies on the smallness and nastiness of man and the grandeur and beauty of nature, sentiments that would not sound out of char- acter on the lips of young backpacking, development-deploring kindred spirits of a later age. Again, it is to be remembered that the first besmirchment of the natural world to be complained of is not material, but social, in partic- ular by the Romantic rebel's own society - not chemicals and chainsaws but the poisonous presence of overly familiar people and practices. The language of protest remains much the same after the products of industrial economic activity are added to the score, and indeed a good part of the complaint is still a complaint against the presence of the traveler's own peers and their influ- ence. Mind you, then as now, this is often expressed in very general terms: "Art, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair" (2.87). The much-to-be-anthologized "beauties of Byron" studded throughout Childe Harold's Pilgrimage do tend, however, to focus on the singularity and specificity of each scene, rather than on their general properties, thus empha- sizing the perspective of the intrepid solitary who finds views and flaunts them. Here and there unflattering comparisons are made to his readers' range of reference, the paltrier natural phenomena of their more limited experience. The river Laos is as wide as the Thames but, obviously, more beautiful and more exotic (2.55n). The tone darkens but the substance</page><page sequence="3">"Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution" 117 does not change five years later in the third canto, as this "most unfit / Of men to herd with Man" seeks his only friends in the mountains, his new home on the wide sea (3.12-13). In his relations to others, the "self-Exiled" hero is no longer a slain bull but a "barr'd-up bird" beating itself against its cage till "the heat / of his impeded soul would through his bosom eat" (3.15). This despite the fact that both Byron and his hero are, in effect, on an extended holiday in Switzerland. They are largely alone in the scenery, and far from the stifling social disapproval of England (where it is true a spectacular marital separation and rumors of incest and other crimes have made life rather hot). But readers of course, have emphatically not been left behind, and various appeals to desire glint constantly through the comparative beau- ties with which they are serenaded. All comparison, ultimately, threatens the violence of human rivalry, even as it is crucial to the establishment of identity. But there is often something naively disarming about Byron's open exercise of this function; at times Childe Harold s connoisseurship even seems unintentionally comic. The note to a stanza describing a Swiss storm reads as follows: The thunder-storm to which these lines refer occurred on the 13th of June, 1816, at midnight. I have seen, among the Acroceraunian Mountains of Chimari, several more terrible, but none more beautiful. (3.93n) What needs a man who can toss off comparisons to the unimaginable meteorology of the Acroceraunian Mountains of Chimari with our desires or admiration? In general, there is rather an obvious vaunting of experiential virtuosity running through all his descriptions, amplifying the traveler's mere claim to having been there. Not only was I there, not only was it more impressive than what most of you have ever experienced, but see what it inspired in me! An experience is a possession, of course, and therefore an object of medi- ated desire. From the naive imposition of an endless slide show of our last vacation, to the subtle but perceptibly distant look in a man's eyes at the men- tion of some exotic place, he may not even be so blatant as to say he has vis- ited, its power is social. One need not make one's own clearing in the woods, or spit or shit on one's own snippet of the natural earth, in Michel Serres's image (1995, 33); one need not hold title deed to it or overrun it with armies in order for a place to be in play as one's own in the market of desires. In Childe Harold , of course, there is a certain amount of tactical denial of this, of the I-let-it-be-free-and-look-it-came-back-to-me variety - and no doubt this more</page><page sequence="4">118 Ian Dennis sophisticated kind of internal mediation has its virtues. It is cooler, less unfree, less overtly desiring, to virtually rather than literally possess something. And then to deny possession, or social prestige at all. When we speak of "virtual" gratifications, we must also remind ourselves that an experience, to attain anything close to its potential value, must be rep- resented. As Eric Gans has taught us, any representation, and this must include represented experience, can be at least temporarily shared2 - although the subsequent and resultant portioning out of the feast, the hordes of tourists tramping through the paradises of original experience, must certainly be man- aged. Byron and the other Romantics, we might say, made an invaluable con- tribution - however motivated - to the representation of the natural world as desirable to the maturing market; as desirable, that is, to those seeking to mas- ter that market by denying it - the only true mastery, which all pursue, or flee from. Later defenders of nature too often try to disavow the Romantics. Where would we be, in this noble cause, without them?3 The minerals and materials extracted from the earth are certainly in circulation in the global market, but so also are (more shareable) experiences of its beauty.4 The latter, too, are rec- ognized as not necessarily renewable resources. When we say we want to save nature we are saying we want their market value to rise beyond that of their competition. We want to encourage greed for them. Byron certainly did. As Byron matures as a poet of nature and a poet of experience, however, there is also some mellowing of what might be called his early possessiveness, this rather fierce defense of an obviously precarious identity. Famous passages on Lake Leman in the third canto of Childe Harold are closely associated with the concession that "to fly from, need not be to hate, mankind" (3.69), and although the "wanderers o'er Eternity" may see and feel compelled to tell us about a perfectly amazing range of colors of water they have seen (3.70, 3.67n), there is a hint, even in the Wordsworthian claims of identity with such splendid natural scenes, of a lordly new tolerance of the rest of us - as long as we keep our distance. Perhaps this just reflects a more subtle strategy, or we might call it a more developed aesthetic judgment or taste. It is, after all, low and obviously weak too forcefully to contemn one's supposedly unimportant rival. As Tennyson's Ulysses will say with similar condescension of his plodding son, "he works his work, I mine." "Mine" just happens to be "to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield" (2000, 1214, lines 43 &amp; 70). But I think it is also a question of the changing internal dynamics, as it were, of the poet's alliance with the power of nature. Nature, one might say, begins to have on him the kinds of effects he was hoping it would have on others. Like his friend Percy Shelley, Byron asks nature to allow him to be a "sharer" in her "fierce and far delight" (3.93) - with obvious implications for</page><page sequence="5">"'Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution" 119 his relations to those with whom he pointedly does not share. Interestingly, however, at the end of a powerful sequence of stanzas, we have this: Could I embody and unbosom now That which is most within me, - could I wreak My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw Soul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak, All that I would have sought, and all I seek, Bear, know, feel, and yet breathe - into one word, And that one word were Lightning, I would speak; But as it is, I live and die unheard, With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword. (3.97) This is not just a trope of inexpressibility, I think, but a concession of superior- ity and a partial ceding of power. It remains within an alliance against the Other. But it does not say, as Shelley famously does to his West Wind, that the poet is "One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud." Byron does not pray for the "Spirit fierce" to blow through his lips "to unawakened earth / The trumpet of a prophecy!" (2003, 414 Ode to the West Wind , lines 56, 61, 68-69). His approach looks rather more like a posture at least of humility - I recognize the glory of nature and I realize how impossible it really is to make it metaphor- ical for myself. Albeit, I am in this (always) unlike others; I alone realize this impossibility. The model is beyond rivalry, but by modeling myself upon it - establishing thus a kind of partnership with it - I attain even in my primary futility a secondary ascendancy over my human rivals. My "voiceless thought" is replaced by lightning, not by inadequate human rhetoric. The lighting speaks, persuades, for me. To it I bow, but of course to none other. To put this in René Girard's terms, not for the first time is an explicit appeal to external mediation a tactic in the struggles of internal mediation. My humility, my reli- giosity, distinguish me from you; indeed, they trump your worldly pride. This is very much the approach in one of Byron's best middle-period works, the "mental" drama Manfred of 18 16-1 7. 5 Perhaps the most impressive Byronic hero, the mage Manfred associates himself with the Alps - their blasted pines as reduced as he - but not with any sort of ascendancy over them or through them. Indeed, he is first shown vaingloriously challenging the spir- its of the natural world, summoning them and loudly telling them "not to scoff at his will." The very universe is instinct with such scoffing, though, as we see in his immediate and humiliating collapse. He is at once chastised in the celebrated "Incantation," his Byronic heroism itself subjected to a scathing critique: its hypocritical strategies of domination, even of what we might now call passive aggression, are laid bare. This is rather a new note in Byron.</page><page sequence="6">120 Ian Dennis Not that there is any sort of suffering, even this sort, that cannot be recuper- ated into power, and Manfred does reassert himself. But it is clear that, at the very least, the external world of nature can no longer provide him with the transcendence he cannot help but aspire to. At the most, it can bear witness, as does the lightning in Childe Harold , to the scale of his failure and thus to his superiority to every mere success, every craven tactic of desire practiced upon him by the Other. At the climax of the play he is besieged by both Mephistophelian demons and, I think more importantly, by a human represen- tative of consolatory submission, a Christian Abbot. He triumphs over both. Thou didst not tempt me, and thou couldst not tempt me; I have not been thy dupe, nor am I thy prey - But was my own destroyer, and will be My own hereafter. - Back, ye baffled fiends! (3.4.137-40)6 This is the old Byronic vaunting, at its best. But, although he is also able to withstand the power of natural beauty to make him want life - the setting sun is apostrophized with great grandeur, and then bid farewell - he does seem to acknowledge the sway of a greater desire, another desire rooted also in the natural - namely, of course, mimetic desire itself. This acknowledgement never quite coalesces, in Manfred, into a clear formulation, because the poet of Manfred , I think, has not yet quite admitted it to himself. But the knowledge is there, and not just in the "Incantation." It is present in the heartbreaking awareness of the price to be paid for every attempt to triumph through indif- ference, the terrible paradox of internal mediation, the withering of all value in rivalrous struggle: If I had never lived, that which I love Had still been living; had I never loved, That which I love would still be beautiful - Happy, and giving happiness. (2.1.193-95) And it lurks even in his defiance: I could not tame my nature down; for he Must serve who fain would sway - and soothe - and sue - And watch all time - and pry into all place - And be a living lie - who would become A mighty thing amongst the mean, and such The mass are; I disdained to mingle with A herd, though to be leader - and of wolves. The lion is alone, and so am I. (3.1.116-20)</page><page sequence="7">"Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution" 121 There was never a better place, I think, to recall Girarďs excellent dictum about every "despite" being a "because" - or Shakespeare's commentary on those who protest too much. The play has constantly demonstrated Manfred's attempted (and generally successful) "sway" over his human Others. Not indeed as alpha-wolf, but as self-proclaimed solitary lion. This is the "nature" he could not tame down, the "living lie" he accuses himself of being. He does not go on living the lie, however. Even if the deeper insights of the poem are not openly displayed, Manfred does show us that it is possible to refuse all but the very finest essence of power, the absolute zero degree of enviable indifference. He does not kill himself - that would be to betray desire - but he does somehow willingly turn his back on nature, not in a glory of imagined transcendence but with a simple and clearly exemplary gesture of human solidarity. Taking the hand of the Abbot whose theology he still spurns, he says, "Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die" (3.4.151). And does. In short, the tactic that has helped make Byron famous, the alliance he has forged with the inhuman - not a devil's bargain because he's seen through the devils' tricks; they are too much creatures of desire themselves to give him any serious trouble - this alliance with the seeming external mediator has begun not so much to unravel as to mutate into something rich and strange, some- thing rather grander and less handy. The pose of lordly humility has willy-nilly been slipping toward humility in truth. A humility rooted, it seems to me, in an increasingly ineluctable awareness of how the process actually works, or as we might say with Girard, in the romanesque. If indifference to others is power in the market of desires, the greatest of all models of power is all around us. The natural world seems the only truly external mediator left, the ultimate model of heedless alterity, the sublime indifference to which all aspire. The only external mediator? The question of Byron's religious faith has been debated, but I think it is actually not too complicated, despite a smatter- ing of references throughout his poetry to the deity or fates or demiurges. One of the best places to find Byron's mature view of the matter is the fine short lyric, Prometheus , also from the creative transition year 18 16. 7 In Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound the chained hero is voluble, the deity is silent and unmoved, and Prometheus in the end will capitulate and be unbound. Some two thou- sand years later Byron is responding to - or announcing - a changed situation, in which the relation to the sacred center is more intimate and, indeed, can be conceived of not just as rivalrous but as reciprocal. In the universe of this poem there is no monopoly of power; the Titan struggles directly with "the Thunderer," and not without success. This surely is the essence of internal mediation, that the nearby model must participate with the subject in a duel of desires, the goal of which is to make the other the subjected imitator of one's own desire.</page><page sequence="8">122 Ian Dennis The desire that Byron's poem describes, and that is the virulent core of internal mediation, is what Girard calls "metaphysical" desire: mimetic desire in which the explicit, external object has dropped out of the triangular struc- ture, leaving the two subject-models face to face. Since an absence of desire for external objects can only be interpreted as a (triumphantly gratified) desire for oneself, real power lies with those who can most persuasively demonstrate indifference to the other, who can betray less desire. In such a situation even a sky god's desires will no longer automatically attract those of earth-dwellers. And even the indifference of the merest crawling worm might be able to dis- concert and hollow out the power of gods, at least if the gods betray desire themselves through their acts of oppression. As the second stanza of the poem tells us, Zeus takes "pleasure" in creating the beings he will annihilate - it is "the ruling principle of Hate" (20) - a signal weakness that leaves him vulner- able to the defiant refusals of his intended victims. One such refusal is Prometheus's "Silence" - imagined to be a most pow- erful weapon. In it is his Olympian foe's "Sentence," in the sense that Prometheus is refusing to reveal the details of his prophecy of Zeus's downfall. This refusal has its own kind of power, its very absence of expression appar- ently persuading the oppressor of the accuracy of that prophecy, and filling him therefore with anxiety, with "evil dread" (33). But this is also a suffering- in-silence - "The suffocating sense of woe, / Which speaks but in its loneliness, / And then is jealous lest the sky / Should have a listener, nor will sigh / Until its voice is echoless" (10-14) - and to the oppressor's knowledge of his future defeat is added another sentence of punishment: the immediate emptying out of his power as a result of Prometheus's defiant unwillingness to acknowledge it. This brings on the Thunderer's "vain repentance" (32), which is clearly linked to his treatment of Prometheus rather than to the impersonal workings of fate. That the two aspects of Promethean silence combine in triumphant rivalry with the oppressor is never better demonstrated than by their final result. By the end of the second stanza, it is Zeus who is striving, and unsuc- cessfully, to conceal his feelings, to "dissemble" - one of a telling sequence of symmetries, of exact reversals, that are the inevitable indicators of meta- physical desire. We are even to imagine - a highly satisfactory projection of the subject's desire upon the defeated model - that the once-omnipotent hand holding the lightning bolts "trembles," as his victims once trembled before him (34-35). As the stakes in the struggle here are also metaphysical in the related and more familiar philosophical sense of that word, the ability to resist the attrac- tion of the other, to defy the other's power, is connected to the transcendence of spirit or mind over materiality. Two strikingly paradoxical phrases draw attention to the grandeur of the claim being made against the power of the sky-god: Prometheus, bound and immobile, possesses "patient energy" (40)</page><page sequence="9">"'Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution" 123 and repulses his oppressor with an "impenetrable Spirit" (42). Energy, in fact, is only ever potential in Byron; once released, it is oppressive power, or dissi- pation and loss. And spirit is here celebrated for the quality of impermeability, which is actually only of use in physical things and is futilely longed for by consciousness. But the import of these expressions is clear: Prometheus has what his oppressor lacks, what his oppressor has lost in the self-betrayal of desiring hatred while oppressing him. It is the oppressor's spirit, the once "inexorable Heaven" (18), whose "soul" has been pierced with "repentance" (33), that is now the penetrated thing, the trembling physical being, while it is the ostensible victim whose motionless body has allowed him to become invulnerable spirit, whose (fortunate) inability to act has enabled an apotheo- sis of his "will" and "mind." He and the sky-god have changed places. Prometheus's "boon" to "Man," is his promise that if we imitate his response, thus strengthening ourselves in our own minds, we can achieve, in and through our suffering mortality, a similar triumph. As noted, Prometheus's theft, in effect, of the Thunderer's spirituality, of his immaterial invulnerability, must be laid at the door of the oppressor himself, of his desire-betraying attack on the Titan. (For this to have been a desiring action on the Titan's part would of course have cost him that advantage.) The Thunderer has handed Prometheus his victory, clearly enough, by refusing him "the boon to die," by making him the "wretched gift of eternity" (24-25), which the Titan has "flung back" (27) in powerful irony and to the discomfiture and defeat of his oppo- nent. To mortal man, the Titan is "a symbol and a sign" (45), and the poem is most original in its reconfiguring of Prometheus's gift to us from the actively useful fire to the more passively inspiriting prophecy and model. In his immo- bility, Prometheus permits us to see both our "funereal destiny" (50) of death and suffering, and the strategy of passivity by which to exploit it. In torture itself, with all that it demonstrates of the victim's irresistible attraction for the torturer, we are to "descry" our "own concentered recompense" (57) - a splendid phrase, richly suggestive of the claims of autonomy in connectedness, and the rewards of a centrality defined by those who are drawn toward it. The Thunderer now reduced to helpless materiality, we are "triumphant" over him not when we suffer in eternity as Prometheus does, but when we contemptu- ously spurn our own materiality and all the promises of gratified desire it holds out. We are triumphant when we deliberately make the Thunderer's desire- betraying oppression permanent and defy his implicit invitation to imitatively desire his own immortal freedom of action ... in short, when we make "Death a Victory" (59). Prometheus teaches us not to want life, and thus to want less than our opponent(s) - it is a kind of manifesto for victimary power. The patri- archal deity is now enmeshed in the reciprocal effects of desire. Which of course is to admit he is no deity at all, but merely other human beings, whose power is to be resented and resisted.</page><page sequence="10">124 Ian Dennis But real lightning bolts don't tremble at human indifference, at human stoicism and suffering. And they are immune to resentment. Another measure of Byron's sense of the reciprocality between external model and human sub- ject at about this stage in his career is his poem Darkness (again, 1816). The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; (2-5) Byron was not the only person to imagine such an apocalypse at about this time, but his treatment focuses interestingly on the violence triggered by the disappearance of the sun, and upon the utter indifference of these celestial processes to human responses of any kind, and especially toward the suffering of those who "looked up / With mad disquietude on the dull sky" (28-29). As everyone and everything dies, even the once distinguished and personified elements fade out of identity - "The winds were withered in the stagnant air, / And the clouds perish'd" (80-81) - until a primal homogeneity is established, like the collapse of all matter and light into a black hole: "Darkness . . . was the universe" (81-82). There is a complete absence of moralism in this. The sun did not go out for our sins. It did not go out because we were insufficiently respectful, or because we had no contract with it. It just went out. If it had anything to do with us, nature does not deign to provide a sign. And nature does not notice our absence any more than it does our cries, our pathos, or our "needs." In Byron, increasingly, one senses the smallness of man, and even of our earth, in the scale of the cosmos. His Lucifer, a few years later, will challenge the last of the Byronic heroes to scale his desires, especially his desire for difference, to the universe as it really is: And if there should be Worlds greater than thine own, inhabited By greater things, and they themselves far more In number than the dust of thy dull earth, Though multiplied to animated atoms, All living, and all doom'd to death, and wretched, What would'st thou think? ( Cain 2.1.44-50)9 (This, we might remind ourselves, is a perspective from a good long while before the Mt. Palomar or Hubble telescopes. At any rate, Byron, like these devices, ever reminds us that "nature" does not end at the top of our atmos- phere and is not bounded by known life-forms.) Where Manfred was still able</page><page sequence="11">"Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution" 125 to imagine some sort of alliance between the power of natural indifference and his own dark glamour, this later Byronic hero will be entirely nonplussed. Don Juan (1819-23) recognizes more openly what was only partially or indirectly grasped in the poems we have been looking at. That is perhaps to say, Byron's later work acknowledges what the principles and tactics described above might imply in universal application. It is reasonably clear what it means to worship, or defy, a power which can be influenced by such subjec- tion. But what does it mean to worship nature? Don Juan is a social poem, a tragicomic satire. It is Byron's great survey of European civilization in his own day, very much including but not primarily concerned with the role in it of his own Byronic self, now viewed with a calm but pervasive irony. Nature or natural description is therefore not a frequent focus, but on a couple of occasions it is crucial, the very center of the world- view the poem expresses, the guarantee or anchor of the system of internal mediation it describes. Nature is shown, that is, as it surely must always now be shown, as both completely indifferent to desire and (thus) its source. In the second canto, young Juan, for no particular reason, amidst a ran- dom selection of his fellow men, finds himself drifting in an open boat, "at mercy of the waves, whose mercies are / Like human beings during civil war" (2.42). 10 This is a "waste of waters; like a veil, / Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown / Of one whose hate is masked but to assail" (2.49). The most fitting metaphor for the nature without is the nature within - both kinds of nature as savage as they are loving. But this is not pathetic fallacy, even if we, like the castaways, might be tempted to think it is. The anthropomorphic note, which tantalizingly recurs through these passages, is a tease, really - nature's tease as much as Byron's. It is a metaphor, not a reality, and to Byron, now, only realities matter. His mariners, like mankind, gaze out as they must at something all-beneficent one moment, haughtily destructive the next, emp- tily enigmatic the moment after that. When what they most want is not so much good or bad treatment as meaning, a sign. There are references to Noah, and then that most familiar of all metaphors in this context, the most scrip- tural of pathetic fallacies: Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea, Resting its bright base on the quivering blue; And all within its arch appear'd to be Clearer than without . . . (2.91) Byron's sharp eye is at its best here: through the arch, because of its framing, clarity, and promise. Men look for a sign, for deliverance, of course. But through this arch they can never pass, any more than Tennyson's Ulysses ever</page><page sequence="12">126 Ian Dennis can - hard not to think the later poet remembered this passage when he wrote of a similarly unattainable and nautically inflected desire: Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough Gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades Forever and forever when I move. ( Ulysses 19-21) Juan is certainly having an experience, but unlike Childe Harold's or Manfred's lakes and alps, nature no longer mirrors his soul, or proffers him a distinction from the rest of us. I think there is no verbal irony here, either. Let us not make a discovery that many others have made sound unduly original or profound. But Byron's lines, like Don Juan as a whole, are at any rate perfectly unambiguous on the matter: there is no omnipotent controller of nature, either dependent or independent of our desires or deserts. There is no deal, no bargain, no sign, and no God. The irony was always in the anthropomorphism. To put it another way, from the perspective of the internally mediated world it is not the deity's vengeful hostility that prevents redemption, but just the elusive mobility of the clarifying, desire-inducing phenomenon itself. The rainbow is not static. It changed of course; a heavenly caméléon, The airy child of vapour and the sun, Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion, Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun (2.92) Not that it isn't good to be affected by such desires, to take, for example, such effects as omens. "It is as well to think so, now and then" (2.93). Hope can help, as long as hope, or for that matter, desire, is kept general, ready and able to respond to any of the infinity of promptings offered by the "celestial kalei- doscope" (2.93). The "desire of life / Prolongs it" (2.64). A "bird of promise" is good too, because it may really mean land is nearby, and in any case if it perches it can be eaten (2.95). Which brings us to the notorious manifestation of desire most pertinent to our purposes. Bird or no bird, starvation looms in the little boat. The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed, In silent horror, and their distribution Lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded, Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution; (2.75) Byron's history with Prometheus is extensive. What we are being told here is that divine resentment has become automatic, impersonal, and is now called by a different name: "'Twas nature gnaw'd them to this resolution" (2.75). It</page><page sequence="13">"Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution" 127 takes a different, if equally carnivorous form, also: not a divinely dispatched vulture, or any other external oppressor, but ourselves, each other. None are excepted, none are "permitted to be neuter" (2.75), in the sense that no one can escape the lottery, or the hunger. One can say no, however, to this deity, as Manfred or Prometheus or, later, Byron's Cain say no. One can say no, and take one's chances, as in fact Juan does. And he guesses right, as the cannibalism turns out poorly - interestingly, it seems that it generally does, although perhaps not in the spectacular, immediate way of Byron's sailors, "tearing and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing" (2.79) and then dying. Cows do go mad, mankind does not prosper, eating their own. On the other hand, it is pure luck that Juan, and only Juan, eventually survives. Others who forbear dining on their boat-mates - "three or four / Who were not quite so fond of animal food" (2.78) - drown anyway So, before the famous but, by comparison, somehow almost plaintively surprised lines - Tennyson again - about what is "red in tooth and claw," there was this. Why do we eat each other? Because nature leaves us no choice, except to die. Byron's knowing depiction of the operation and effects of desire, in combi- nation with his mature belief in the human ability not so much to attain Byronic indifference to desire as to be capable of the Promethean no in answer to its inducements, implies that he sees no fundamental difference between its appet- itive and cultural forms. Both are mediated, and we know this because we can identify both sufficiently well to defy them. Nature is not an environment, a stage upon which things happen. It is a gnawing power, an all-purpose media- tor, an imperious model - the ultimate model. And of course, when one con- siders Nature's centerless structure and constant adaptive mobility, its pervasive capacity to evoke desire and its admittedly unreliable but still observable capac- ity to at least temporarily satisfy it, this is nature itself as market. Or at least, the analogy, the homology, insists upon itself. This diffuse structure is what most clearly distinguishes nature from singular external mediators of the past, at any rate, even from pantheistic or pagan systems of nodal deities whose powers, if only locally powerful, were still magical and beyond direct rivalry Indeed, given that the shift in the focus of desire is from the singular and far-off to the plural and immediate, perhaps it is inaccurate to speak of nature's "external" mediation at all. Nature is not necessarily so far off, as Byron's mariners know all too well. It is everywhere; in T. S. Eliot's beautiful phrase, "more distant than stars and nearer than the eye" (2000, 2388 Marina , line 20). The "external" quality of this mediation turns out to be the illusion of Childe Harold's exoti- cism, a projection of his aspiration to difference. Juan eventually washes ashore on a remote island and is rescued by the beautiful pirate's daughter, Haidée. They have a love affair, under circum- stances that Byron insistently describes in the language of paradise and Eden.</page><page sequence="14">128 Ian Dennis There is much to be said about this, but their love, to be brief about it, is inex- tricably natural and cultural in its provenance. In keeping with its seemingly paradisal character and location, however, Byron takes great pains to develop Haidée's desires as powerfully inherent, or "pure" - unmediated in any obvi- ously social way In a remarkable passage, he tells us what the function of such implausible desires and perfect love is in an internally mediated context: Oh beautiful! and rare as beautiful! But theirs was love in which the mind delights To lose itself, when the old world grows dull, And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights (4.17) Haidée and Juan's love is a focus for thought, where the mind can lose its social bearings, can escape the hack sounds and sights of the mimetic world, the mercenary world of imitation, of a stale and never successful struggle for orig- inality. The idea of nonmimetic desire, like the idea of paradise, is a crucial refuge, a touchstone - a transcendental signified if one prefers - a necessary angel. The renovating virtue of this spot before time, of course, is the desider- atum of much Romantic imagining, but Byron now dissociates the figure of the poet or poet-like hero from the project. This is not the special preserve of the specially sensitive, but something rarer and more general, "what we mor- tals call romantic / and always envy, though we deem it frantic" (4.18). Here is where Haidée differs from her male predecessors: she is no poet, and when she falls, she falls silent, as Prometheus teaches us to do. Before that fall, she is what we in the fallen world - in the market of "petty passions" (4.17) ever trying to be grand passions - she is what we all envy and desire. She models for us what we cannot help but want but cannot ever successfully imitate. She makes that market hum. This she can do because she is not of it, and can never be outmoded. Her death, therefore, perhaps comes as close to the genuinely tragic as any Romantic death can come. Her "piratical papa" returns unexpectedly, indeed, mutates out of Juan himself in one of Haidée's dreams, shattering the idyll with the inevitability of human mediation and human rivalry. Actually, we discover, he was there all along - the model and blocking figure par excellence, not only in Juan but in Haidée herself; we are repeatedly reminded of how much daughter resembles and doubles father. Lambro, the father, is of course a rival for his daughter's sexuality, but his reasons for destroying it are interesting. He thinks they are market driven. He thinks Juan is an adventurer, a poacher, a bargain hunter, and the spectacle of the fire-sale dispersion of both his daugh- ter and his ducats, it must be conceded, does give him quite a good reason to think so. Very much an operator in the market himself, he nonetheless regards</page><page sequence="15">"'Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution" 129 his patriarchal will as sacral authority - it is rather a Tory problem, actually He wants to believe he can keep an island of this sacredness to himself, but comes home to find pillage and secular excess dancing in the heart of his sanctuary He does not take it lying down. Juan is contemptuously flung from the garden and back onto the open market, back into slavery, where he belongs. Literally, he ends up on the Istanbul slave-block, where he is bought by an imperious sultaness. But Haidée does not take it lying down either, and, true to the line of Byronic heroes whose continuation she is, refuses to live with anything less than perfection. Father and daughter share a grave in a paradise whose aban- donment and sterility colors our last glimpse of the natural world as such. The great poem moves on, to history, and to the world we actually live in. Here, in the context of Juan's rudely forced reentry into the market, is one of Byron's most succinct descriptions of how that world works - "works like a sea," in his enemy Wordsworth's resonant phrase - through internally medi- ated desire: 'Tis pleasant purchasing our fellow creatures; And all are to be sold, if you consider Their passions, and are dext'rous. Some by features Are bought up, others by a warlike leader, Some by a place - as tend their years or natures; The most by ready cash - but all have prices From crowns to kicks, according to their vices. (5.27) 3. Summing Up " [A] 11 are to be sold, if you consider / Their passions, and are dext'rous." These are certainly the words of a man who has learned something about "passions" and the market. "Ready cash" may be the most flexible and common device, but it is the desires, the passions, that are the actual medium of exchange, and Byron, perhaps stumbling into it at first, but in the end with considerable self-knowledge, was "dext'rous." Power is the goal, the buying up. The objects of desire are unimportant, changeable, convertible from one to another. Modeling and avoiding subjection is the thing. Don Juan is the great poem of the market, announcing its inevitability and diagnosing its operations, as well as modeling for us a wide range of strategies - almost all of which operate in the general mode of irony - by which to live and (more or less) prosper within it. Don Juan is the epic of so grand a thing as "the shift to internal mediation," of the triumph of commercialization if one prefers, even of what Karl Popper calls the "open society" with all its always eventually inadequate solutions.</page><page sequence="16">130 Ian Dennis As the mediation of desire passes irrevocably from conscious beings - even the most powerful of which can be resented, eroded by comparison, sub- jected in their turn - Byron's poetry recognizes nature for the only truly unmoved mover, the primary model. That is to say, he recognizes in ways the other Romantics do not the social implications of the new love of nature. Byron, it might also be said, made the move, in René Girarďs terms, from romantic to romanesque: he rejected the Romantic merging of subject and object, rejected Romantic epistemology, rejected anthropomorphic nature and natural supernaturalism. The world of Don Juan , as is often remarked, is a world without a center and a world without authority, only desires and losses - contestations and at best temporary victories. Nature, to the human a limitless periphery, exerts maximal power on our desires without offering any single tar- get of resentment. Our attempts to coopt it, or parts of it, into alliances against our human Others, are bound not to abject failure so much as to eventual inad- equacy. If an alliance is otherwise to be defined as any arrangement between players in a market whereby rivalry is less within the arrangement than in the market generally - marriages, companies, nations, are examples - then the imagined alliance with nature is bound to be revealed as illusory, a deception for the eyes of others or for one's own, not a real alliance. Nature allies itself to no one. One may profess one's love and respect for nature, to other human beings. But nature will not echo such professions, or listen to them. The soli- tary Byronic hero on his alp succeeds in the market in the sense that he attracts considerable imitation and experiences the exaltations of his difference. But Byron himself came to recognize the concession of his own lack of autonomy implied by the strategy 'Twas nature gnawed him to the recognition. The waves on Don Juan's ocean are like human beings in a civil war, their mercies are as tender. That poem as a whole is primarily concerned with desire and constantly reveals an understanding of desire as mimetic. Nature's promptings - sexual, gustatory, combative - are not categorically different from those of acknowledged culture. Byron depicts a wide range of human attempts to cope with desire, sometimes with comic effects, sometimes tragic, but never to our permanent gratification. It is thus a poem full of human strength and weakness, but completely devoid of scapegoats. There is irony, and lordly amusement, and lordly anger. But no authorial resentment - and this absence is its clearest badge of the romanesque. Byron knows better - from having provoked and been their object, perhaps - than to indulge the fantasies of resentment. It is as if he has learned from and gone beyond Prometheus. If the lightning bolts tremble even in the hands of the father god, who is to be imagined so powerfully beyond our desires as to be able to poison the very wells of our being? Nature, only. And nature cannot be resented. Nature best resembles, in Byron's mature poetry, that infinitely various and infinitely provoking source</page><page sequence="17">"Twas Nature Gnaw'd Them to This Resolution" 131 of desires we can call the market. It is the origin of the desires, of the prom- ises, and also is the deliverer of whatever temporary relief and gratifications we are to achieve. In Don Juan the operation of the market, or nature, is the same in an open boat, on a paradisal island, in the Istanbul slave market or its sul- tan's harem, on a gruesome battlefield, in the Russian court, or at a country house full of bored English aristocrats. This perhaps marks the limit of what I can usefully develop as this poet's contributions to the issue of mimetic desire and nature. Questions are cer- tainly raised, of course, if we take his vision seriously, and implications prolif- erate. I will limit myself to one of each. There is more than a hint of the old pathetic fallacy, of the aspiration to an alliance with nature, in many modern attempts to come to grips with the risks of environmental exhaustion. For example, in arguments for some- thing like a "natural contract," in Michel Serres's phrase. Byron's poetry might ask what can it possibly mean to establish a contract with a mediator - or a "subject" (Serres 1995, 36) - who by definition cannot establish any kind of reciprocity? If one were to say, "I will try not to act on my desires to your detri- ment if you try not to inspire so many of those desires in me," what possible answer could one expect to receive? And if there is no answer? Eventually our sun will indeed go nova, and go out. A particle of dust in the immensity will drift out of the light. The problem of preserving the tiny fragment of the natural universe that we inhabit is perhaps finally a social problem, like dividing up a very limited feast so that all are (more or less) satisfied and violence is avoided. It is not best thought of in terms of a one-to-one relationship between human beings and some equality or partner called Nature. The feast will best be preserved for everyone, not through some once-and-forever renunciation of our (natural) desires or imperious reconception of our relationship to them - some kind of resacralization of our social existence - but through the development of inter- nal mediation, which is to say, through the ongoing management and refine- ment of desire through representation, the continued leaving-behind of the zero-sum game of sacrificial society, and the growth of the kind of self-aware- ness about our desires - one might call it an ironic perception of them - that a poet like the maturer Byron models for us.
