<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BEING AND ATTRIBUTES OF GOD. By Rev. Francis J. Hall, D.D., Professor of Dogmatic Theology in the western 1neological seminary, Utucago. (Long- mans.) 6s. net. This book is the third of a series of ten single volume treatises, each complete in itself, which Dr. Hall intends to publish, and which will together constitute a systematic work on Dogmatic Theology. The aim of this volume is constructive rather than apologetic, though the position and</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES. 177 theories of opponents are closely examined. The work will not appeal to the man in the street. It is essentially a book for students. To read it with any ease at all a man must understand the terminology of metaphysics and the philosophic point of view. The student, however, who reads it with care, will find it most helpful as a systematic examination into the grounds of belief in a personal God. Occasionally there is a tendency to assume too much, and sometimes the author takes for granted that a strong assertion will serve his purpose as well as argument. For instance, the following sentence would seem to demand some effort at proof: " The Bible also clearly teaches that mankind was originally monotheistic, and this teaching appears to be confirmed by what little the science of the history of religion can tell us that is relevant." We like to think of mankind as originally monotheistic, but is the teaching of the Bible and of the history of religion really so clear upon the matter? The main body of the work is, however, full of sound reasoning and of serious argument. Dr. Hall is a firm believer in the value of the cosmological, the teleological, the ontological, as well as the moral arguments for the existence of God. Kant's failure to appreciate the value of the first three was due, he suggests, to his attempt to criticize the cognitive faculties apart from other psychical faculties and in mental isolation : " The subjective criterion of knowledge is not the self-sufficiency of the intellect considered in isolation, but the normal working of a feeling, willing, and cognizing soul considered in relation to knowledge." To the agnostic, who says that though there may be a God, yet we certainly cannot know him, Dr. Hall's reply is very powerful : " It is clearly fallacious to transfer the conditions of our knowing to the objects of our knowledge, and to infer that because we know only under certain conditions, therefore, we know only those things which are similarly conditioned in themselves. We know under conditions, but this does not mean that we know things as subject in themselves to such conditions. We know things as transcending the conditions under which we know them. What is conditioned is the relation in which, and the extent to which, we can know them." Space will only allow us to notice one other point in the book, but it is a point of exceptional interest. When we</page><page sequence="3">178 NOTICES. describe God as a personal Being, we are sometimes met with the apparently cogent objection that such a description is anthropomorphic, and that personality necessarily implies limitation. This Dr. Hall says is quite wrong. We are limited because we are human, and not because we are persons. Limitation is not an essential requirement of personality. The essential requirement is self-determination. The idea of personality cannot be adequately actualized in any finite embodiments, and so far from involving finitude, requires infinity for its full embodiment: " God is more truly personal than we are: and this remains true in spite of the fact that we are unable entirely to eliminate human and finite connotations in calling Him personal."
