Much of the recent trend of events in the social sciences indicates a widespread interest in the examination of the bearing of the economic principle upon social life and institutions. This principle has been stated clearly by John Stuart Mill in the ninth chapter of Book VI of his " Logic," as the psychological law that a greater gain is pre- ferred to a smaller. Political economists, as a rule, make use of the principle only in its narrower aspects as " self-interest," but so varied are its broader applications in sociology and history that it fascinates many synthetic thinkers in various branches of knowledge. Professor Veblen assumes without comment the validity and suffi- ciency of the economic principle throughout his work, and Mr. Payne announces it in the preface to his first volume, publisled in 1892, as something altogether new upon which he has stumbled accidentally in his search for a rational explanation of civilization, and in the use of which he has some misgivings. In the second volume, published seven years later, the mistaken newness has worn off and Mr. Payne makes good use of the economic attitude throughout his work. Professor Veblen's field of inquiry is much more limited than one would at first sight suppose from his general and somewhat pecu- liar terminology and from an enumeration of the topics treated. He seeks to explain the effect of beliefl, tradition, institutions and social standards upon the industrial serviceability of the individual or group of individuals considered only as producers or consumers of material wealth. The Leisure Class is made up of those engaged in worthy employ- ments, which means those having the element of exploit. Further- more, the class is non-industrial, in that its exploitation is one of human beings and has not for its ultimate purpose only the utilization [282]</page><page sequence="2">THE THEORY OF THE LEISURE CLASS. of non-human things. This class begins by appropriating things, and its history is one progressive drill in exploitation, appropriation and administration of appropriated goods. Women in primitive times are appropriated as trophies, and therefore the chief thing Mr. Veblen sees in his economic analysis of the function of woman in present society is the fact that she is still in a sense a trophy, an index of man's power and prowess, engaged in conspicuous, wasteful and vicarious consumption of goods, because in this way man can show most readily the extent of his economic resources. Woman is made to wear corsets as a final proof that she is not intended to do useful work. The underlying motive in ownership is emulation. It has nothing to do with the needs of subsistence, but from the motives of pecuniary emulation property is, first and last, booty, regarded as a trophy and exhibited (consumed) in ways to bring out the power and prowess of the owner. Thus there arise secondary demands of emulation, which require abstention from productive work, because labor is evidence of inferior force. At least the exemption must be from all useful employ- ment. "Time is consumed [by the leisure class] non-productively (x) from a sense of the unworthiness of productive work, and (2) as an evidence of pecuniary ability to afford a life of idleness." This is what Dr. Veblen calls "conspicuous leisure," and is supposed to explain on the basis of primitive distinctions, under the conditions of primitive society, the industrial value of the efforts and labors of the propertied classes in modern society. Much more in the same spirit could be cited if there were space to review the chapters on " con- spicuous consumption," "the pecuniary standard of living" and "the pecuniary canons of taste." Enough, however, has been said to point out Professor Veblen's chief error in method. He takes his data largely from the disputable facts of primitive society without even sufficient evidence that he has made good use of the best material so far as it goes, and he then assumes that having explained the origin of an institution he has explained its underlying motives and tendencies as it exists in modern society. Thus by a series of long-range deductions from the facts of primitive society, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the facts are correct as stated, he explains the mechanism of many modern institutions in a way not justified by a direct economic analysis of the motives and tendencies of which the individuals in modern society who are re-creating and working in and through the same classes of institutions are conscious. By way of illustration Professor Veblen might say correctly that clothes originated in the desire for ornament at a time when they did not represent any real need for defence or [283] I39</page><page sequence="3">140 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. protection from climatic conditions. To conclude, however, that the desire for ornament is the chief desire in modern man's consumption of clothes would be to ignore the change in the nature of modern man, who, through the peculiar conditions of his heredity, finds clothes a requisite of existence, no longer being able in temperate climates to go without them. Hence the adaptation of clothes to his need of warmth, the demands of health and the adjustment of clothes to present activities become dominant factors even in ladies' cloth- ing, factors revealed only by a direct analysis of present economic factors and not revealed at all by Professor Veblen's long-range methods. Professor Veblen's errors are not all of the class that could be attrib- uted to the error in method referred to. Thus again to meet Dr. Veblen on his own ground, I may illustrate from what he says of the results of the animistic habit of thought (p. 287). In its effect on the believer, and in general what he says here reflects the spirit of his analysis of all religious belief whether classed as animistic or not, the result is a lowering of his effective intelligence in the respect in which intelligence is of especial conse- quence for modern industry. Just the opposite result is what we would expect from all a priori considerations, and indeed is what exact observation verifies. No doubt the spiritual outlook on the animistic and anthropomorphic plane is relatively a lower one than that pos- sessed by believers in cults that have intellectually refined the animis- tic element. Take, however, the crudest forms of animistic cults in modern society in their effect upon their believers and contrast the latter with individuals in the same general class and stage of economy with respect to industrial efficiency: this is the problem posited by Professor Veblen if I understand him. Any psychologist will say that the believer is more industrious because he believes that he can do more by virtue of supernatural aid than an outside intelligent judgment of his powers would be willing to predict. He does accomplish more because he believes he can and therefore succeeds in approaching nearer the maximum limit of his real powers than he who does not share this belief. Furthermore the believer in animistic cults usually manifests a higher feeling of responsibility (I) to some higher being and (2) to his family or to other individuals and classes in society, and this feeling operates directly as an industrial motive producing indus- trial results. Perhaps no better illustration of what may be an ab- surdly anthropomorphic representation of spiritual forces but none the less an industrially effective one is revealed in the remark of the small boy who told his mother to go away because it was bad enough to have God watching him all the time. [284]</page><page sequence="4">THE THEORY OF THE LEISURE CLASS. Conspicuosity; invidious rivalry and imitation; social values meas- ured by waste; social position determined by proficiency in chicanery, in conspicuous uselessness and in predatory instincts; social forces, the survivals of barbarian culture; these are the general conclusions reached. What has become of the first principles of evolution if a social order survives on that which has destroyed the social order it has displaced? What new elements have entered into the world- struggle to modify these relics of barbarian civilization ? Is it not these new elements that are the essential factors in any such discussion as that projected by Professor Veblen, yet of them he has nothing to say. It is safe to say that this is an almost untouched field of investigation for the political economist. Indeed the sociologist who must attack the same problems first in their more immediate effects upon the per- sonality of individuals and upon the origin, structure, growth and permanency of social institutions has scarcely as yet attempted an analysis of the available material for such studies. Until sociology has made a more thorough study of social survivals it would seem a priori to be impossible to make with success any such cross-section investigation or comparison of results within the narrower field of the phenomena of industrial activity of what implies a co-ordination of the results of the two parallel social sciences of sociology and political economy. Dr. Veblen's book is sufficient proof of the hope- lessness of the task as he conceives it, in the present stage of the social sciences. He has given us some interesting reading viewed as a cynical comment on modern life, and has made some contribution to the study of social survivals, but the title of his book is a misnomer, because it is not a satisfactory theory of the leisure class. Within a more limited field of observation, but taking into consid- eration a far wider range of application than Mr. Veblen, Mr. Payne has succeeeded in giving us in his " History of America " a most suggestive experiment in the use of the economic principle. He is not tempted to make the same error of method because in the two volumes already published he begins with with the discovery of America and ends with a discussion of the Inca institutions in ancient Peru, and nowhere does he depart in his deductions from the scope of the data of primitive aboriginal American society. American history is in every sense indigenous. The social economy of the advanced aborigines is traced to physical conditions on this continent, and advancement is explained in terms of the organized provision of the food supply on an artificial as distinguished from a natural basis. Book I, making up about one-third of the first volume, is devoted to the story of the discovery with the stress laid on the principles of economic geography which the main facts in the discovery serve to [285] I4I</page><page sequence="5">142 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. illustrate. Book II, comprising two-thirds of Volume I and all of Volume II, is devoted to aboriginal America, where civilization is shown to have proceeded, not from European causes but from physi- cal causes inherent in the social condition and history, previous to the discovery, of the advanced tribal groups found by the Spaniards. The absence in the New World of many animals capable of domes- tication, and especially of milch animals, gave agriculture the domi- nant place in the moulding factors of American civilization. One hundred pages in Volume I are devoted to a study of the artificial production of food and to the extension of agriculture until religion is added to agriculture as an economic factor in civilization. "'The Covenant of the Gods" gives to human society coherence and sta- bility, and thus becomes an important economic factor. While the substitution of an artificial for a natural basis of subsistence is the first stage in human advancement and the first great change in the transformation of human society, the establishment of the gods as the principal members of the community is the second stage, and the third stage, according to Mr. Payne, is the creation within the com- munity of an industrial class, in subordination to a non-industrial class which directs and protects it. The functions of the leisure class in this analysis based on immediate data are: (I) To insure, by accu- mulated knowledge and provident care, that labor shall not be wasted and misapplied; (2) to stimulate labor, by compelling the laborer to perform an adequate amount of work, and (3) to confine consumption on his part within moderate limits. A very interesting but too brief discussion of the Pueblo as the unit of aboriginal history is to be found in the second volume, the bulk of which, however, is devoted to a discussion of the origin and growth of language in its bearing on the problems of economic geography and historiography. This discussion goes quite a bit afield of the central problems in the two volumes which are of so much interest and importance to the economist and sociologist. Mr. Payne has at least made a most satisfactory start in a fruitful direction both for historian and sociologist. It is safe to predict for his volumes a wide reading and a considerable influence upon future studies in many fields. The range of his information and the wealth of ethnological resources at his command entitle the author of the "History of America " to considerable praise and to a calm, consid- erate hearing.
