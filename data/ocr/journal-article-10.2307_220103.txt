<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 159 AFRICAN REFLECTIONS: ART FROM NORTHEASTERN ZAIRE. By Enid Schildkrout and Curtis Keim. Seattle: University of Washington Press; and New York: American Museum of Natural History, 1990. Pp. 272; 3 maps, 234 illustrations (many in color). $45.00. The authors, an anthropologist and an historian respectively, focus on the interaction between European colonizers and the peoples of the Mangbetu kingdom in the early part of this century, in order to clarify the art history of northeastern Zaire. This book, an artistic treasure in its own right designed by Alex Castro, is a companion to an exhibition of the same title held at the American Museum of Natural History in late 1989. Both were inspired by the amount of detailed historical information available on the Mangbetu stemming from the Congo Expedition led by Herbert Lang and sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History from 1909 to 1915. In addition to Lang's extensive field notes on his contacts with numerous peoples of the region and the 10,000 photographs and 4,000 objects he collected for the Museum, there are available the results of several European scientific expeditions to the Mangbetu region between 1902 and 1915 and, most tellingly, the historical and modem fieldwork studies of co-author Curtis Keim. The repeated early contacts of foreigners with the people and especially with the artists of the region are significant for the authors' principal thesis, that the quantity of anthropomorphic art for which the Mangbetu are principally noted, developed in response to encounters during this early colonial period. The artists' depictions of Mangbetu features on pottery, harps, knives and ivory objects reflect, according to the authors' analysis, the people's increasing awareness of themselves as "Mangbetu" or as "Africans" vis-a-vis the Europeans. In earlier works, the human figure motif and even the harp itself were not found among the Mangbetu as much as among surrounding peoples. Both before and after the early period of intensive contact, artistic practice in this region favored geometric design in objects made for daily use. It is refreshing to note that the authors in examining these mundane objects accept what Africans tell us over and over, that they carve, paint, or decorate because they want to make objects beautiful, a point often dismissed by anthropologists. Another "reflection" traced in this study is the mythic image, as the Europeans developed it, of the Mangbetu as an artistic people pursuing abhorrent practices and how that image justified colonial and missionary intervention. The importance of this book goes beyond its art history thesis, for it is an example of an historical investigation that takes account of the heterogeneity of the region and the complex interactions of the peoples who lived there, as well as the diverse currents and events both near and far affecting the relations between Africans and outsiders, making it necessary for the historian to go beyond ethnic</page><page sequence="2">160 BOOK REVIEWS typologies and to consider the effect of the changing economic and political conditions on that particular period. John Mack's multi-faceted chapter on the Azande and the richly detailed essays by Demolin and Miller on musical instruments provide additional support for the approach and conclusions of the principal authors. One fascinating chapter, "Collecting in the Congo," captures vividly the rise of political and scientific interest in the region and the specific relations between the Congo and the American Museum that led to the expedition. Herbert Lang, the leader of the expedition, was a mammologist whose primary interests were in the recently discovered okapi and other animals, but during his long stay he developed close relations with people in the court and in villages that inform his field notes. In particular, he affected the artists by his admiration for metal and ivory carving and by his patronage. This book's lasting value is that the authors have drawn out of Lang's notes and photographs illuminating information on his comprehensive collection of material culture which, in turn, is greatly enriched by Keim's recent fieldwork in the region. The bulk of the book focuses on objects, both from the Lang collection and from other museums, which are sensitively photographed and clearly related to the framework of social organization and technology and to practices of adornment and the craft of royal power. In the chapter "Dealing with Destiny" the authors carefully explain the familiar topics of ancestral power, kinship, witchcraft and sorcery as they are evidenced in Mangbetu society and, much to their credit, they also explore a rarely addressed topic, concepts of individuality. Their later argument that representational art was unlikely to develop indigenously because the people ascribe meaning to natural materials seems weak if one recalls that that ascription is shared in areas where representational art has developed quite richly. Among peoples of western Ivory Coast, for example, where I have studied, the generative power lies in the leaves, not in the artful masks or carved figures. However, their concluding arguments on the rise of portraiture among the Mangbetu, the mutual regional influences, the addition of anthropomorphic features on objects, and the expansion of carving in ivory material are convincing and offer not only a permanent contribution to regional art history but also a powerful model for other studies of African art MONNI ADAMS Harvard University</page></plain_text>
