<plain_text><page sequence="1">95 "It started with these Images"- Some Notes on Political Film- making after Brecht in Germany : Heike Sander and Harun Farocki by Thomas Elsaesser Politics today has become inseparable from the collective affects moulded and transmitted by the mass-media, which constitutes a means of subjec- tion crossing over classes and nations, and at the heart of which it is very difficult to separate the manipulated fantasies from socio-economic reali- ties. (...) Thus when young men and women rush headlong down the road of "terrorism", they don't do so only because of ideological systems, but also as delegates or sacrificial offerings of a subjective movement that surpasses them on all sides. * One of the problems that avantgardě film-making had to confront in the 1970s was the cinema's relation to politics. It would take more than one article to list the many divergent uses of the term "political cinema" since Godard first urged his profession not to make political films but to make films politically.1 In Britain and the United States this has often been understood as a return to Brechtian theses of non-linearity and anti-illusionism, of specta- torial distanciation and un-pleasure. In an effort to build a bridge between contemporary theory and a film-making practice that understood itself as political, with or without explicit reference to Brecht, Sylvia Harvey wrote: The versions of Brecht set in circulation after the 'Brecht Event' at the Edinburgh Festival (Summer 75) . . . tended to concentrate upon the 'Brechtian- isms' of distanciation, anti-illusionism, deconstruc- tion, the critique of identification processes and the * Felix Guattari, Semiotext(e) Vol IV No. 2 1982 p. 106-7</page><page sequence="2">96 dismantling of 'classical' narrative. It was a recov- ery of Brecht guided by the revival of interest in modernism characteristic of post-68 French cul- tural theory, and in line with the 'politics of form' debate for which film production 'only becomes politically effective if it is linked with a breaking down of the traditional way of depicting reality'.2 In the wake of this "politics of form", avantgardě film-making be- came almost synonymous with critical interrogations of the twin supports of mainstream cinema: narrative and the specularity of the image. What has become evident in the 1980s, however, is that such critical positions, whether explicity formulated in theoretical terms or implicitly present in a given practice, are themselves vul- nerable to an ideological charge: that of positing a unifed subject of enunciation (usually characterized by normative or prescriptive dis- courses), and of advocating an oppositional, or counter-strategy (locating the critical object in symmetrical and binary paradigms). Both these characteristics of critical theory and practice have been identified with a "politics of otherness" in which opposition is al- ready defined and contained by the practice against which it sets itself - an impasse in critical thinking which Fredric Jameson, in a slightly different context has described as "politics dominated by the categories of the Imaginary": to stage a relationship in terms of so radical an opposition is somehow covertly to reintroduce Imaginary thinking itself into a thought which was apparently attempting to overcome it.3 Both the political, Brechtian avantgardě, and its opposite, the formal, "structuralist" avantgardě, which in turn, has been effec- tively criticised by feminist film-theory in the name of a more hetero- geneous film-practice,4 show how difficult it is to place oneself on the side of the symbolic in a discourse. Is it possible to unravel the situation from another set of terms, and from another political con- text? At the margins of the cinema's adherence to narrative lies the problem of temporality, and at the margins of a fascination with the image lies both a "will to know" and a historically specific invest- ment in "presence". That these are themselves political categories has become abundantly clear through the theoretical work of Fou- cault and Derrida. In a necessarily oblique yet dialectically grasp- able fashion, their epistemological critiques can be seen to have as their target the visual media and the 'civilization of the image.'</page><page sequence="3">97 Television, for instance, in its representations of the Symbolic order - as history, or politics - obsessively relies on spectacle (the rendering of an event as an illusion of presence) and on narrative (the ordering of sound and image in a discourse governed by the logic of implication). Its dominant mode of temporality is thus an impression of reality (the image as evidence and document) joined to a secure subject-position (knowledge defined as the possession of this fantasmatic presence). Conversely, political events, in order to attain such "truth of the image" must necessarily pass through proc- esses of sometimes intense specularisation, with the paradoxical effect that in order to become recognizable as political, actions have to be representable in terms of spectacle. This is one of the double binds of terrorist action, for instance and signals its collusion with the Imaginary: the politics of the Red Brigades in Italy or of the German Red Army Fraction (Aldo Moro, Hans Martin Schleyer) were as exhibitionist in their relation to the regimes of the visible, as the countermoves on the part of the au- thorities (police raids, show-trials, spectacular freeing of hostages in Entebbe or Mogadishu) were politically pornographic. Even the war in Vietnam seems in retrospect to have implied on both sides a war of images, a matter of staging events not only in order to effect a change in the control or possession of enemy territory, but in order to produce images which might transgress the terrain of the visible itself. A reversal has occurred in the relation of pro-filmic event to fil- mic scene such as had been predicted by Apollinaire, in his short- story Un Beau Film where a crime is committed uniquely in order to gratify a desire to film it.5 What in Apollinaire appears as the gesture of the aristocratic aesthete, may however, in a politics of marginality - whether Palestinian, Vietnamese or European ultra- left - be grim necessity (regardless of how suicidal it proves to be) in a situation where the symbolic order manifests itself only through its Imaginary representations, i.e., the discourses of power, pleasure, knowledge as constructed by cinema and television. For whatever reason, and some of them are obvious, West Ger- man film-makers, both on the side of the avantgardě and among the so-called authors' cinema, seem to be much more directly in- volved in the consequences that such a situation imposes on filmic practices than is the case in Britain or the United States. German film-makers, notwithstanding the international acclaim that some</page><page sequence="4">98 of them received in the 1970s, on the whole situate themselves rather outside the debates and issues that have dominated film theory and the Anglo-American avantgardes during the same period. This does not mean that their practice cannot be described or analyzed in the terms of this film theory - rather, it introduces into the debate a differential element and a resistance derived from a practice both more directly political (because of the financing structure that directors and producers depend on) and more self- consciously so (because of the cultural and national politics they find themselves implicated in) than is indicated by the so-called 'politics of form'. If the discourses - critical, theoretical, polemical - with which the German cinema surrounds itself are often difficult to place in a wider international context, the films themselves do not pose the same problems. In fact, in many ways, they occupy a theoretical field which almost makes them ideal objects for the kind of theory that, say, Sylvia Harvey or Constance Penley are looking forward to. Whereas it once was almost a commonplace to regard any form of cinematic illusionism as inimical to political functions other than propaganda, recent emphasis on the construction of the subject in cinematic discourse has allowed a much more nuanced approach to the Imaginary specific to film to emerge as politically significant. Secondly, the fact that structural and linguistic theories of narrative have severed the analogical -mimetic connexion between story and history (which had dominated the political analysis of fictional nar- ratives since at least the Lukacs-Brecht debate in the 1920s and 30s) helped a view of narrative to gain ground that gives priority to the processes of figuration at the expense of tying narrative to any kind of pro -filmic referentiality. Both these openings provide an under- standing of the German cinema's characteristic emphasis on his- tory and subjectivity defined as problems of temporality and a fas- cination with the image. To put it quite generally: German film-makers invariably privi- lege the Imaginary, which they interrogate and deconstruct not on the side of the Symbolic, but by different kinds of excesses and intensities situated on the side of the Imaginary: by doubling, split- ting, mirroring, by an indifferentiation threatening the narrative with dissolution, by repetition and the staging of the self in perfor- mance and display, by masquerade and transexuality. While in its various forms this is most evidently the case for Fassbinder, Wen- ders, Herzog, Syberberg, Schroeter, Ottinger or Achternbusch, it</page><page sequence="5">99 also holds true of such explicitly political film-makers as Heike Sander or Harun Farocki, whose awareness of sexual politics or political economy is crucially articulated through an examination of images. The directors named have in common a concern with the image as a source of fascination and of subject-effects which enter into the construction of both history and knowledge in the cinema, and thus of political action, at a stage in the development of the audio-visual media where no discourse of the real, of power or of presence can claim authority outside the codes of representation and of imaging. History and subjectivity may therefore be thought of as special categories of image production, rather than as registers opposed to image production. These general remarks could serve as an introduction to a num- ber of modern European film-makers not confined to Germany: Godard /Miéville, Straub /Huillet, Marguerite Duras, Chantal Akerman. Their work will be present in what follows as the outer horizon bounding the concerns of German film-makers in the 1970s. Among these, I want to isolate the films of some of the lesser known directors, Heike Sander and Harun Farocki. Sander's films Redupers and The Subjective Factor have had several extremely searching and illuminating articles devoted to them6. Among Far- ocki's films, Zwischen Zwei Kriegen (Between Two Wars, 1971- 77) and Etwas Wird Sichtbar (Before Your Eyes-Vietnam, 1982) deserve to be better known, as do his film -essays and critical writ- ings. For this reason, I shall draw most of my examples from the work of the latter, with occasional reference to Heike Sander. In what sense can one say, then, that German cinema gives pri- macy to the image in its reflection on history and subjectivity? Both The Subjective Factor and Before Your Eyes-Vietnam take photo- graphs as their narrative pre-text for positioning their central char- acters in relation to a biograhical as well as political past. "It started with these images", Anna, the female protagonist in Before Your Eyes- Vietnam explains after seeing war correspondents' pictures from Vietnam: When I worked as a typist in an office, in 1966, 1 first saw them (in the papers), and for their sake I wanted to change my life. I wanted to be a partisan. At the office I tried to work conscientiously and listen attentively, so that when the time came no- one would remember my face.7</page><page sequence="6">IOO The Subjective Factor begins with Anni, a former activist in the German student movement and now in her forties. She is visited by her 18 -year old son, who brings her as a present a coffee-table book of photographs documenting the events of 1968 in Berlin and West Germany. While the two are idly turning the pages, Anni's voice can be heard, off-screen, saying "that's me, here, in the car, fronting the protest march; your mother". In each case, images des- tined for public circulation implicate the viewing subject, and place her in a complex set of references. These references, which immedi- ately situate the characters in a double discourse- that of the fic- tional diegesis and the historical referent into which it bleeds - , entail a narrative trajectory entirely given to unfolding the splits and divisions between conflicting poles: of office girl and militant, mother and demonstrator, Western Marxism and Third World lib- eration movements, of Marxism and Feminism, of '60s optimism and '80s disillusionment. Unlike films where the diegesis disavows or seeks to contain the diversity of referential material by construct- ing a cinematically coherent imaginary space, Sander's and Far- ocki's films work towards the fundametal irreconcilability of die- gesis and referent: the images produce more subject-positions than any single act of recognition or identification can accommodate. Rather than confirming special identity, the photos which Anna and Ann's son look at make their identity problematic not only to themselves but in their relation to others, notably to son, to lover, or to the post- family commune. Yet unlike films which argue against images, at least images that divorce their conditions of production from the context in which they are reproduced (newspapers, glossy magazines, chic exhibi- tions or books marketing the aura of history), the German film- makers are careful not to construct a denunciatory discourse around the fact that all photographs are "lying". For Farocki it is self- evident, for instance, that to make a film about the war in Vietnam is to make a film about the images of and from Vietnam. Thus, the characters who view the pictures in the exhibition of Before Your Eyes- Vietnam look at them not only for what they represent, but for the place and time in which they were first experienced: I used to distribute handbills with this picture of them. Underneath we had written a text that de- manded the withdrawal of the United States from Vietnam. In the street, people swore at me and made threatening gestures. ( . . . ) On the under-</page><page sequence="7">IOI ground train going home, they read the evening papers. And maybe they saw this other picture, with the caption 'in South Vietnam, communists are committing atrocities'. The images were so close together. We pointed at one and said 'Ameri- cans out'; they pointed at the other, saying 'Viet- cong out'. It was like advertising, competing about who could show more atrocities. I felt ashamed.8 This seems to place the burden of truth on the relationship between image and word, or as Farocki's characters put it, a caption to a photo may be correct, but what it says is nonetheless not true: what matters is therefore not what is on a picture, more what lies behind it. And yet, we are showing pictures to prove something that cannot be proven.9 The terms of such an exchange recall the well-known remark of Brecht's, namely that a photograph of Siemens, Krupp or AEG does not tell us anything about capitalism and the sites of industrial pro- duction, because according to Brecht, reality has slipped into the realm of functions and cannot be grasped as appearance.10 Yet Brecht's opposition between function and gestalt (so reminiscent of the montage /realism, Eisenstein /Bazin polarity that has deter- mined the course of film-theory, and which is in danger of being perpetuated by too facile a juxtaposition of the Symbolic and the Imaginary, or the discursive and the figurative in film representa- tion) is both fertile and impossible to sustain, if it assumes a posi- tion of knowledge outside the image from which its truth can be judged. A television documentary called Industrial Photography (1978), made by Farocki with material collected as location research for Between Two Wars is conceived almost as a counter to Brecht's assertion, while nonetheless staying within the same political per- spective of how it is that images communicate. An accompanying commentary describes the project: Most of the images (...) are private photos, images from advertising, images that look like painted still-lives. The film 'reads' these images, in order to talk about labour and about photography ( . . . ), how, for instance collieries are both useful constructions and works of architecture, sites of work, and signs that want to be looked at ... 11</page><page sequence="8">I02 Brechťs stance is both skeptical and Utopian. In its rejection of photography as a means of understanding social relations it takes for granted the convergence of a class-position with a position of knowledge (knowledge defined instrumentally as that which serves the interests of a given class: "the dominant ideas of the age are usually the ideas of those who dominate"). But insofar as Brecht substitutes one form of instrumentality for another, his conception of knowledge is that of mastery and implies a yet to be achieved congruence between (proletarian) class position and (individual) subject position, without which such mastery would amount to an essentially phallocentric view of the subject. Precisely the non- convergence of class and gender, of knowledge and subject, of dis- cursive mastery and emancipation gives images in our culture their crucial role in social relations and makes the films quoted pose the question of history in the subject, and the subject in history. Farocki is right in thinking that an archeological approach to images can teach something about industrial history, "about labour and photography," in as far as he makes the distinction between the site and the sign, which is always present in the photograph as a surplus or an excess pointing to the "materiality" of the image, and giving it a history - if only the history of the looks it has been able to attract. Farocki's documentary wants to be the story of these looks and conversely, his feature film about the images of Vietnam is the documentary of the looks cast on them by two people who seek in them a mirror-image of themselves. It might appear that Farocki's interest in the news-photo is iden- tical to that of Godard in Letter to Jane , where a voice-over inces- santly interrogates a single image, taken of Jane Fonda on a visit to Hanoi in 1969. The commentary works over the image, analyzes its visual composition, contrasts this with the caption - the reversal of active and passive in the verbal coding of the picture for Western consumption - and locates the function of the star-image in poli- tics, of which Jane Fonda has become the icon. Godard /Gorin layer the image in much the same way that Farocki lets his characters worry over the difference between "what is on a picture and what lies behind it". The accretion of information, or at any rate, of dis- cursive activity makes Letter to Jane even less transparent and if anything, more hallucinatory. The film is almost a tribute to the troubling power of, in this case, agency news photography to gather and disperse connotations at the seeming expense of any</page><page sequence="9">io3 stable denotation, because its rhetoric, its ability to solicit and sus- tain a gaze is so peremptory. The fact that Letter to ]ane ultimately increases the hold that Jane Fonda's image has over the spectator undoubtedly did not es- cape Godard himself. His subsequent films have not relinquished this interrogation of the image - quite the contrary, he has become ever more explicit about the power of images, but under a some- what different aspect: as images of power, and in particular, that of men over women. In Sauve Qui Peut (La Vie), Passion or Prénom Carmen he focuses on the violence of arresting an image, stopping its flow, or releasing it, accelerating it. What in the early film appear as slow-motion sequences motivated by the traumas of a separation and the break-up of a marriage becomes in the other films an ever more literal desire to animate (the tableaux of Passion) or to arrest (in Prénum Carmen ), where the film-maker's power to manipulate the temporality of the reproduction process as well as that of the recording process is itself only a manifestation, an acknowledge- ment of the sexual politics of imaging, in a conjunction of love, death and the cinema that makes Prénom Carmen , for instance, curiously reminiscent of Le Petit Soldat. From this vantage-point, the voice-over in Letter to Jane is a declaration of love disguised as an act of discursive aggression: Godard /Gorin assume a position of knowledge whose demystify- ing force in terms of an analysis of Jane Fonda's political image covers a subject position which the ideological reading in turn only mystifies - by a more subtle disavowal of the fascination with the image, itself a sign of the sexual difference on which the political discourse of the film rests.13 (No accident therefore that film-theory has been at pains to specify what makes an image an imaginary signifier, and that avantgardě practice has increasingly focused on the role of sexual difference in supporting the filmic construction of both narrative and non-narrative cinema.) At first sight it might appear that the German political cinema, with its more overtly, and perhaps even naively socio-economic concerns, hardly addresses these issues. However, both Farocki and Sander seem to me to have seized very precisely not only the prob- lem of the voice-over in political film-making, but the sexual poli- tics implicit in the cinema's enunciative and discursive apparatus. Farocki's Industrial Photography goes beyond the Godard of Letter to Jane to the extent that "learning from images" is less the mastery</page><page sequence="10">I04 of a unified subject position giving access to a fullness of knowledge than a retracing of the division between the referential and the dis- cursive and in photography to the divisions of the subject itself. The modern concept of representation, at least that to which we owe the cinema, is based on iconicity, likeness, verisimilitude - but it also relates that which it presents to the perceiving subject in an act of opposition, confrontation even, and defines existence as a placing- oneself-in-relation-to, as a form of positionality; in consequence, such an idea of perception relies on images to mark, stake out, and to confirm space in which to stage the mise-en-scène of a subject. This insight is preserved in Farocki's film not by a psychoanalytic vocabulary; instead, he contrasts the subject with its radical Other: Cameras are built to accommodate the gaze of a human eye. But heavy industry accomplishes work which cannot be surveyed by a human eye. Indus- try extends the labour process over vast distances and at the same time concentrates and joins the work of many different sites of production. A gi- gantic organism; at once beyond vision and of somnambulist precision. How can one grasp this with images? Ought it not be images that fit into no households, on no wall, into no pocket, no il- lustrated book? And on no retina?14 In this passage, Farocki takes up Brecht's position and reverses it dialectically: if he admits that an industrial plant works in ways that no human eye can encompass, the problem lies not with images - the cinema, photography, imaging - but with the norma- tive poverty of the uses, forms of appropriation and circulation that images have been put to in the context of an anthropocentrism for which the human eye is both origin and vanishing point of percep- tion. Farocki's provocative final question leads directly to a specu- lation about what images might represent for whom (the subject in representation) once neither the retina nor the image are conceived as métonymie stand-ins for a subject/object duality governing the relationship between spectator and image. One might even go so far as to suggest that the specific epistemological change that the cine- ma has imposed on consciousness is precisely that consciousness can no longer be defined within any form of a traditional subject- object division. It might be easier at this point, however, to introduce the issues of the status of images via a different context and a different termi-</page><page sequence="11">I05 nology: what largely regulates the spectator's apprehension oř (both perceptual and cognitive) reality in the cinema is the relation of image to referent. While there are some very powerful (and well- rehearsed) arguments why, despite the cinema's undeniable icon- icity, the specific figurative operations of any filmic text ensure that the referent remains in some sense always 'imaginary',15 political film-making has, implicitly or explicitly, always challenged this position, whether by increasing the referential specificity of the fic- tion (as in 'historical' films) or by insisting on some form of 'materi- ality' of the image (as in Farocki's treatment of images as 'docu- ments' for instance). In the former case (and this includes most filmed or televised documentaries) the coherence of the diegesis is charged with producing the reality effect both iconically and by enhancing the spectator's hallucinated presence on the scene aurally and visually. In the latter example, the diegesis is itself fractured, multiple and stands in no clearly determined hierarchical order with regards to voice and image: both have the power (and func- tion) to establish autonomous diegetic spaces from which the spec- tator may or may not be excluded. Indeed, the separation of sounds and image - the theoretical baseline of much avantgardě practice since the 1960s - and the full exploration of their different diegetic functions have done more than any other 'deconstructive' counter- strategy to challenge the traditional identification of diegesis with narrative, and narrative with a linear deployment of binary oppositions. The strategy, initially, seemed to be directed against the illusory or imaginary plenitude of voice synchronized with image typical of the classic narrative film. The emergence of television as the domi- nant audio-visual form on the other hand, had given the separation of sound and image a different political significance, if only because television itself has largely deconstructed and rearticulated the rela- tion of sound and image of classical film. Sound motivates, focal- izes and cues image on television in a way that both emphasizes their material difference as signifiers and at the same time precludes most forms of heterogeneity and oppositional play. As a result, tele- vision can tolerate the coexistence of several quite distant diegetic spaces (whether present through voice only or image joined to sound, as in a reportage that combines studio debate with on- location footage commented on by voice-off) without it affecting the coherence of the discourse: on the contrary, heterogeneity actually consolidates and guarantees the illusion of power of the referent over the image (which is not the same as the power of the</page><page sequence="12">io6 voice over the image in traditional documentary or instructional films).16 It seems to me that most current political film-making is involved in opposing this construction of the referent in television. While manifestly true of Godard or Chris Marker, I think it equally holds for Marguerite Duras or Heike Sander. In different ways these film- makers privilege the voice, insofar as they allow it to create a diege- tic space which is neither subordinate to nor leading the image. On the other hand, their 'voices' rarely comment on the images in a way that would 'split' the spectator between voice and image, be- tween one diegetic space and another. In television, sound anchors the referentiality of the image; in much avantgardě film-making, sound is the referentiality for the image. Such a formulation is de- liberately ambiguous, because it might suggest that, after all, in a Duras film, the voices - their inflexion, tone, timbre - restore to the filmic discourse the kind of imaginary plenitude which charac- terizes classical narrative cinema. Yet this is manifestly not the case, since Duras' voices are present in and absent from the images in so many different ways that no stable heirarchy or dominant fictional space imposes itself or gives the spectator access to a unified posi- tion of knowledge. The soundtrack's referentiality is thus both very precise and very indeterminate: indeterminate by its deliberate and exquisite literariness (evoking not so much the sensuality of a body but that of a carefully layed-out page) and precise by the phatic intimacy that the technologically produced sound-space can esta- blish with each individual spectator. But above all, it is the essen- tially dialogical situation implicit or explicit in her films that places the spectator (as it would conventionally) in a diegesis and displaces him/her from it since the images never quite confirm the fictional space of the voices. In Godard's films, too, and especially his video -work, a dialogue of voices is both inside and outside the fictions supported by the images. But often they structure the enunciation in the form of vio- lence and aggression exerted on the image: the typical mode of the interview or the interrogation (in France Tour Détour , for instance) enacts a display of power, as in earlier films ( Une Femme Mariée, Deux ou Trois Choses) it had initiated erotic play. Godard very successfully unmasks the hidden violence of all enunciative acts in the cinema, whether the verbal as in a voice-over commentary, or visual, as in point-of-view editing.17 Yet sound and image seem in Godard forever locked in a struggle for control and supremacy, as if</page><page sequence="13">I07 the film-maker could not imagine any relationship between the two, other than competitive and bi-polar. Duras, by comparison, wisely lets the dialogical situations in her films be understood as involving lovers, thus allowing quite other modes of separation and joining to structure the formal relations between voice and voice, voice and image, image and image. The German avantgardě may well be assimilable to the positions which - aesthetically and politically - are demarcated by the work of Godard, Duras, Straub /Huillet. But if this is so, it has come to them via a different route. Especially the Berlin film-makers have had to define themselves against the 'documentary' tendencies taught and practiced at the Berlin Film Academy, and in the case of Heike Sander, against the polemically unorthodox doxa of her former teacher Alexander Kluge. Cinematic enunciation has in Ger- many been mainly discussed in the context of the question of sepa- ration of voice and image, the possibilities and functions of com- mentary and voice-over, and of the strategies of the filmed inter- view in structuring a political discourse in the cinema. Thus, during the 70s it was not unusual to find in Filmkritik , co-edited by Farocki, an avantgardě journal that situates itself very precisely be- tween the Munich New German Cinema (it ignores the existence of Fassbinder, Herzog, Syberberg) and the Berlin School (acknow- ledged obliquely in occasional articles on Klaus Wildenhahn, a documentarist who once taught there) reference to Joris Ivens, Peter Nestler, articles on Kracauer's theory of realism, on Jean Rouch next to their very full dossiers on the films of the Straubs. The decep- tive eclecticism of the magazine would have made it easy to over- look the significance of a passing comment on Jean Rouch which appeared in a quite general essay in the early '80s. Citing Petit a Petit (1969), the film Rouch made of a young Senegalese coming to Paris, in order to conduct ethnographic studies on Frenchmen, the author finds that the illuminating wit of the reversal of roles vanished completely the moment I became aware with a sud- den shock that the young black has no other func- tion in the film than to beat out of the bush and drive into the open the game that hunter Rouch is ready to shoot with his camera.18 This attack on the enunciative strategies disguised by documen- taries and ethnographic films constitutes, in the German context, a quite marked shift away from the prevailing practices of political</page><page sequence="14">io8 film-making in the 70s. The economic existence and survival of political film at the margins of television largely depended on di- dactic or poetic uses of off- screen narration. The same article men- tions a television documentary about the monitoring of the ecologi- cal balance in a bird sanctuary. With the sound turned off, how- ever, the images only registered the creatures' fear, the gestures of aggression, the mechanical handling as the birds were captured, ringed and measured. Which to trust - the voice-over commentary or the image? If one believes the image, one may be victim of the naive anthropomorphism characteristic of wildlife documentaries; if one privileges the sound-track, what exactly is the function of the images ? The examples may be trivial, and the test of turning off the sound too simplistic to compare Filmkritik's arguments to Godard's ex- periments with separation of image track and sound-track, which expose the violence that in the cinema bind the act of enunciation to the enunciated. But the German avantgardě cinema of the 1980s becomes interesting precisely where it beings to deconstruct its own (Brecht and Godard-inspired) techniques of sustaining the cine- matic discourse with a critical, "distancing" commentary on the image material. Farocki began his film-making career as a writer- director of didactic agit-prop films about Napalm bombs, Marx' theory of surplus value and the division of labour on a production line. In Sander's films one still senses the effort it took to break away from a Kluge-type voice-over interference with the characters while not losing the ability to redirect the viewers' attention and jolt their absorption in the image. Kluge's mania for formulating epi- grammatic sentences, slogans and doggerel verse is still occasionally present in The Subjective Factor "sprach die Praxis zur Theorie: jutzt oder nie (said praxis to theory: it's now or never)", but Sander makes it clear that 'the illuminating wit' might vanish if one asks who in this instance speaks to whom. What the 'first' generation of post- 68 film-makers achieved by the strict separation of sound from image was the possibility of articulating several diegeses, without marking their spatio-tem- poral hierarchy. This opening up of diegetic space at the expense of narrative coherence favoured the sound-track as the locus of narra- tive authority, at least in many film-makers' work who did not in- vest the same resourcefulness as Godard in conceiving of extra- diegetic spaces that could figure either the pro-or pre-filmic space of production (as in the opening of Tout Va Bien) or signify the act</page><page sequence="15">I09 of enunciation itself. Such a privileging of verbal discourse as one finds in Kluge or the Berlin School, however, does not deconstruct the Imaginary of the image, but opposes to one imaginary plenitude merely another, obviating thereby much of the oppositional force that the separation of filmic signifiers had introduced into classical sound cinema practice. Whereas classical narrative, and even more so, television, divides the signifying materials at the level of pro- duction (division of labour, the filmic process of specialization of tasks and technologies) in order to reconstitute the filmic process in ways that present it as unified, synchronized, diegetically coherent and embedded in an ideology of "presence", the political avant- garde film often maintains a material coherence at the level of pro- duction (the Straubs' work on filming only with synch-sound, for instance), in order to be able to represent the heterogeneity of the materials which support the signifying processes for the viewer. If signification depends, quite generally, on the divisibility of signi- fying materials, it seems that, for the German avantgardě cinema of the 1980s, the opposition sound/image has become less important than it was for the European avantgardě in the late 1960s and 70s, where it became virtually the signifier of difference itself and the mastercode not only for other systems of difference but for the rein- vestigation of the relation of cinematic sign to referent. In classical narrative, the kinds of difference which found the order of discourse, such as male /female, seeing /seen partake equally of referentiality and enunciation: indeed narrative efficacity depends on their convergence to the point of identity, or more exactly, the possibility of their metaphoric equivalence.19 Any given system of enunciation may substitute for a particular system of ref- erentiality, thus regulating the cinematic referent at the same time as it secures the position of the subject. In the same way, it has been argued that with respect to a film's temporal articulation, classical narrative is characterized by a joining together of two distinct regis- ters of time - that of the events narrated and that of the act of narration itself - by eliding wherever possible their differences: the cases where classical narrative keeps them split (as happens in a flashback structure, or with a diegetically present narrator) merely confirm this, because narrative closure brings convergence of the two temporalities, and the suturing is maintained by off- screen narration. If avantgardě films, typically, refuse these forms of convergence, what at first sight is confusing about the two examples I have been</page><page sequence="16">IIO referring to from Germany, Sander's The Subjective Factor , and Farocki's Before Your Eyes: Vietnam , is that the rupture with the classical codes does not apparently produce a set of recognizable alternative codes, at least not systematized, or reinforced by a theo- retical stance with regard to filmic enunciation, such as invariably accompanies Godard's films. The German film-makers' concern seems to be with the problematic nature of the referent - be it the position of women among the post- 6 8 left, or the relation of exper- ience to knowledge in the sphere of politics and history. Yet, as already indicated, neither film aims to construct a coherent diegetic space, and both show a great deal of work in respect to enunciative and narrative strategies. As Kaja Silverman has shown, The Sub- jective Factor "refuses to recognize borders", particularly the gen- eric ones between documentary and fiction film, but also certain enunciative ones: the film's reliance upon hand -held cameras dis- penses with the usual code of camera movement (with the pan, the tracking shot, the zoom). (...) Hand-held camera thus comes to signify the oppo- site of what it signifies in the documentary; instead of functioning as the impinging trace of an external word, it functions as the scopic signature of a given subjectivity. The third-person voice-over undergoes a similar transformation. ( ... It) is female, and closely iden- tified with the point of view which structures the image track - i.e. with Anni. Although its gramma- tical form is "impersonal" it contrives somehow to be intimate and conversational. Not only is this voice humorous, reminiscent, contemplative (in short, the antithesis of the "objective" chronicler), but it also indicates both its discursive vantage and its point of address. (...) Although The Subjective Factor's third-person voice speaks "over" the images and sounds of an earlier period, it is not extra-diegetic. Not only does it speak from the same narrative (...) but from the same discursive position : the position of a feminism struggling to achieve an alliance with Marxism.20 At the same time, there is a multiplication of narrative agents, in relation of who or what motivates changes of either sound or image</page><page sequence="17">III track: the voices and characters on or off- screen are both subjects and objects of the enunciation. As Silverman implies in the case of Anni, the subject of the enunciaton is also the subject of the enun- ciated, so that the film knows both a first-person "I" and the third- peson "she", which are not differentiated in terms of the enunciated (they name the same 'person'), but instead, attempt to operate a division along the temporal and spatial line of "then /now" and "there/here". However, it is by no means clear that the axis "here - now" can be identified with a specific diegetic space that the viewer securely possesses, or whether it is in fact the non- diegetic space of enunciation regulating at a different level of dis- cursive coherence the discontinuities of both sound and image. Thus, while the project of the film is, as Silverman points out, a crossing of enunciative boundaries in order to open up a new space on the side of the referent (for feminism within Marxism), the boundaries which the film establishes, in order to secure its own discursive functioning have to do with mapping onto the linguistic difference of personal pronouns the temporal and spatial differ- ences which signify historical charge. The consequences seem to me twofold. The textual strategies of Sander's films invariably pose questions of autobiography, either because the director is herself present in the image as a 'character', or because the nature of the slippage between off- screen com- mentary and on-screen presence aims to create a solidarity between voice and image, commentary and representation. What Silverman calls the "scopic signature of subjectivity" in the film might be use- fully discussed in terms of the splitting of time and space in the inscription of the spectator: what we associate with memory, recol- lection, nostaligia, and according to Barthes, with photography in general: Four kinds of imaginary interact, confront each other, distort each other. Before the camera, I am all at the same time: the person I believe myself to be, the person I would like others to believe me to be, the person whom the photographer believes me to be, and the person whom he uses to demon- strate his art. The cinema may have such a hold on the spectator, not because of its analogical properties simulating 'normal' vision, but as a func- tion of its signifying process and its mode of figuration. These reproduce the double structure of memory and recollection, which</page><page sequence="18">112 is seeing oneself as one once was but from the perspective of what one now is or has become. Cinema thus doubles the spectating self in the act of viewing, and the 'seen' affects the spectator only inso- far as it evokes a previous 'scene' (of seeing). This is of course the thinking that underlies Metz' notion of primary identification,22 but it also indicates the term's shortcomings, namely that it is not so much an identification with the look, or auto-scopia, but specu- larity within a structure of spatial and temporal displacement that organizes the spectator's position of knowledge. By underlining separation and distance, non-convergencé of sound and image at crucial points, as well as by cutting across different diegetic spaces both within the fiction and between fictional and documentary material, Sander is paradoxically representing intact a certain Imaginary - that of the introspective, self- remembering subject, which is quite distinct from the Imaginary of classical narrative (the subject unified in the illusion of fantasmatic presence), as well as from its deconstructions in the films of Godard or Kluge. Identifica- tion is thus not forestalled; rather, it is presented as essentially split in such a way that the separation of the two temporalities - that of the enunciation and that of the enunciated - mirror and double each other in a specular but not necessarily fetishistic structure, for which the Metzian terms of primary and secondary identification are not altogether appropriate. Subjectivity in The Subjective Factor is the retrospective reading of spatial and temporal discontinuity: it may well be an exemplary way of defining the relation of feminism to the development of the West German Left in particular, and history in general. The second consequence of Sander's particular textual strategies - and in some sense the dialectical opposite of trying to represent subjectivity in history - is the film's testing of the public discourses supported by the recorded voice and the recorded image - the tentative insertion of feminist concerns in the public record of history, so to speak. In a number of memorable scenes, Sander confronts the image of the (fictional) Anni with the voice of the (historical) Heike Sander addressing a student rally in Frankfurt in 1968 - an address that has survived on an audio-tape as a record of her presence, but which the film cannot match with its appropriate (historical) image, because the cameras - operated by men - were not turned on when Heike Sander took the platform. Instead, concentrated on figures like Rudi Dutschke and Peter Weiss. Thus, the film that is now trying to recover for memory the experience of history comes face to face with sexual differences as coded in terms of voice and image,</page><page sequence="19">ИЗ sound-track and image track. Again, which is the more objective, the more trustworthy? - the question is wrongly posed, since neither is true, and their joining would simply disguise the division of authority and power which their technical divisibility legitimizes. Sander's work on enunciation, on the voice and image in cinema thus has to be seen in direct relation to her concern with the ref- erent: to stake out and struggle for a space within the already con- stituted discourses of the audible and the visible where feminist ex- perience can be heard and seen. Farocki's film is literally called 'Something is Becoming Visible'; likewise, Before Your Eyes- Vietnam, is crucially concerned with visibility and representability, but whereas in some sense Sander sees one as the condition of the other, Farocki might be said to be interested in the conflictual and antinomical relations between representation and visibility. The narrative of Before Your Eyes- Vietnam centres on a couple, Anna and Robert, whose being together, separation and brief reu- nion in the port of Wilhelmshafen at the end dramatizes their com- mon past in the student movement of West Berlin, the shared desire for cooperation which it promised, and the melancholy realization that men and women cannot work together politically. This rela- tionship and its difficulties are, however, present in the film only in a very muted form, insofar as the couple's central preoccupation has to do with the problem of understanding politics, and the war in Vietnam in particular, through its presentations. What models are there, for figuring the relation of world politics and individual experience, of dominance and marginality, of the Untied States and Vietnam, and what function do images have in this? As in Duras, the love story acts as the fictional support for setting up a dialogical situation which echoes through the film, and is not confined to the couple Robert and Maria: an American psychoanalyst questions a Vietcong prisoner about his family background, a North Vietna- mese man is talking to a South Vietnamese woman, and the story as a whole is framed by a confrontation in a hotel room between Claire, aka Judy, aka Francesca and Mr. Jackson, alias Rosenblum, alias Frankson: she a terrorist fighting the US in France, Idaho and Mexico, he an SAS member in Algeria, a CLA liaison officer in Viet- nam, and now a scientist employed by the Pentagon to supervise research programs at American universities. Their dialogue ends with him killed by her revolver and her slashed by his razor.</page><page sequence="20">114 The dialogical situation in Duras' films, as in other examples of art cinema, often works towards a stark opposition of diegesis and referent, where the referents become, if not unreal, then in some sense substitutable, with the filmic images occupying, between the 'timeless' space of the verbal diegesis, and the historically specific referent, a status of their own: the images of India Song neither enact, nor represent, or even seek to contain the play of historical or geographical referents that the text evokes. Farocki's dialogical structure, on the other hand, seeks to fix a referent which is his- torically and politically overdetermined - "Vietnam" - by inscrib- ing it in a series of exchanges, and processes of substitution or transformations, which aim at disengaging from "Vietnam" neither a position of knowledge, such as a correct political analysis of the war and its aftermath, nor a social space in which given individuals might experience their objective conditon or coummunicate with others; instead, love connotes (as many passages in the film indi- cate) a perpetual movement of joining and separation (until the final 'severing') governed by a structure which might be para- phrased as: "you never speak from where I listen". Vietnam be- comes a 'model' representing the possible conflicts and combina- tions between two radically non-equivalent, non-synchronous, non- symmetrical entities - whether these be countries (US-Vietnam), temporalities (now /then), productive relations, types of warfare (army /guerilla), individuals and lovers (Robert/ Anna), or cinematic signifiers (sounds /images). At the same time, Farocki, like Sander, knows that in the sphere of representation, a dialectic operates be- tween the subject interpellated by public images (pictures from Viet- nam make militants/pictures from Vietnam "depoliticize" militants) and the discourses (Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis) by which subjects want to repossess what escapes them through the fact that images place them in the Imaginary. Yet these discourses, as the film shows, are conducted as dialogues, and as such, invariably structure both identity and difference with a fundamentally a-symmetrical relationship: Robert: Why, when lovers embrace, do they fall silent; and when they start to think or speak, they disengage from the embrace. Or worse still: two lovers talk. When they run out of ideas, they em- brace. But to join love with politics, that would mean doing both, simultaneously. Anna: No, you cannot put it this way. Two lovers can embrace silently and it is like a conversation.</page><page sequence="21">115 Or they stand far apart and speak to each other, and it is like an embrace. Robert: I'm a student of labour-sciences, but of course not actually enrolled in a course.23 Before Your Eyes- Vietnam constantly returns to images: the his- torical, public images from Vietnam, which Robert and Anna inves- tigate, analyze, interpret, remember, place, discuss, abstract and generalize from; the film also enacts them, demonstrates them, has them re-represented by actors staging what Farocki calls the picture-motifs of Vietnam: A GI, flat on the ground listening with a stethoscope for underground tunnels; the execution by the chief of police of a Vietcong prisoner in a Saigon street; an upturned bicycle used by a Vietcong soldier as a power generator for a light-bulb. Then, there are the images, the similes which the characters formu- late as they attempt to understand the different relations that Viet- nam has to themselves, the present, what it can teach in the '80s about militant politics in the '60s and what political lessons are still implicit in Kampuchea, Laos and the Boat People. As they look at the ail-too familiar pictures and see themselves in the mirror, Robert says: "It's like a trailer for a war-film: An exciting love story against the background of war and genocide", to which Anna replies: "It looks so obscene, because we are unharmed. In these pictures, the victims are bloody, but the aggressors are all unharmed."24 Yet while both the photographic images and the mental images are representations, their relation to knowledge and subjectivity is different. Hence the potential conflict between visibility and repre- sentation, as modes of struggle and resistance. The former CLA agent puts it most succinctly: Ten years ago (ie 1960) nobody knew where Viet- nam was. Vietnam only became visible through the war. (...) How good it sounds, to be against war. War is above all an experiment. An experiment with research objectives which cannot be formu- lated in advance. Where did you get your know- ledge from about Vietnam? (...) Most likely from a book like Strategy for Survival , financed by the CLA, and with a preface by Henry Kissinger. In this war, Vietnam represented itself most splendidly. And it's American science that brought this out.</page><page sequence="22">II 6 Why plough a field? So that the surface gets larger. American bombs have ploughed Vietnam, and it became larger and more visible.25 The two opposing factions are thus united, according to the film, by their common effort towards mobilizing the means of representa- tion, but the visibility that results from warfare, spectacle and images does not produce anything other than that fantasmatic interpella- tion of the subject which Anna calls "obscene". More radically, perhaps, than Sander, Farocki's notion of representation involves strategies of enunciation which imply the absence of the enun- ciated, in order to represent a given referent. In The Subjective Factor , Vietnam is present in the political debates (along with the Shah's visit in Berlin, Vietnam was the central reference for the stu- dent movement), and Sander returns to it ironically, when at the end of the film, Anni and her friends go out for a meal and find themselves in front of a restaurant called "Vietnam". Against the self-cancelling wit of Sander's matching of an image with its contradictory referents, Farocki's method is closer to that of the Straubs who might be said to have worked most consistently on the differentiation of here /now, (the tense /space conjunction of dominant cinema) and its possible permutations, as invoked in the remarkable title of one of their films, "too soon/too late". Farocki's film, while not explicitly built on such an almost Blochian non- synchronicity, constructs many of its scenes on the negativity of a "not here/not now" with regard to the representability of Vietnam for and by West Germans. The tableaux which demonstrate the "visual motifs" of the Vietnam war are in one sense like the mini- narratives of Godard's Passion or the story-collages of Raul Ruiz, but they make no effort towards either sumptuousness or mimesis, and instead concentrate their deliberate artlessness on bringing out certain abstract and abstractable features, which require a non- diegetic space, while nonetheless indicating that these images were staged in West Berlin. Discontinuity, however, also plays within the linear movement of the film: in one scene Anna describes (in voice- off) how she kept herself awake during the night in order to study. Only when she has finished do we see her sitting on a chair, demon- strating how her grip relaxes and the keys noisily slip to the floor in the process of falling asleep. Coming in a different context and at a different moment in time, her enactment is not an illustration of her words: it is less an exercise in Brechtian distanciation than a medium-shot framing of a mysterious gesture as one might find it in Bresson's Pickpocket or his Jeanne d Arc.</page><page sequence="23">117 The various forms of discontinuity and heterogeneity in the artic- ulation of space and time, the substitutability and effacement of a stable enunciated with regard to character and place, the a-syn- chronicity of sound and image are, in Before Your Eyes- Vietnam, directly related to the master-dialectic that seems to be for Farocki the hinge on which both the political problems of the film and the narrative and enunciative strategies turn: the dialectic of joining and separating, of which - as indicated - the love story is the fic- tional representative. "The beginning of an investigation is when one joins two ideas, but at the end one has to isolate an idea, take it out of its context", Judy/Clair says to Jackson /Rosenblum. Later on, Robert remarks, "In 1972 we wanted to connect everything with everything else." To which Anna's new man, Michael later replies: "You have to keep things separate. Two things can lie close together, and yet each can be regarded separately. Or they are far apart and nonetheless closely refer to each other." But Anna pro- tests: "Keep things separate, but how? First the Vietnamese chil- dren torn to shreds by American bombs. Then the mountains of bodies in Cambodia, all with their skulls smashed. Then the sinking boats with Vietnamese refugees (...) You call this keeping things separate, but I would rather draw a line. In 1977 I wanted to draw a line, and sever connections."26 What emerges in the course of the film is a critique of metaphor, and the problem of figuration with respect to a given referent con- structed through imaginary signifiers. The political problem of the film is how to learn from the experience of Vietnam, how to extract from history and its representation a model for practice. As Robert says at one point: "One has to replace the images of Vietnam with images from here, express Vietnam through us." The narrative en- dorses this as a necessary move; yet this joining of two distinct ref- erents via images, this expressing of one entity through another as- sumes as equivalent what is non -equivalent and incommensurate. Politically, metaphorical thinking is criticized in the film, because the 'Model Vietnam' teaches, precisely, that concepts such as strug- gle and resistance do not name oppositional or binary processes, but involve a dialectic of strong and weak, machine and tool, centre and margin, the visible and the representable. To comprehend this by metaphoric substitution ("joining") is to turn the referents into mere signs, and to construct discourses, such as those of the clas- sical cinema, for instance, where the material support of these signs, regardless of the concrete specificity of the referents, can be divided and separated arbitrarily. This is why the film ultimately argues for the local, the irreducible quidditas of its own discrete moments,</page><page sequence="24">ii8 whether these moments are historical experiences or whether these are images: "In our culture, images are given too little signifi- cance. Images are appropriated and put in service. One investigates images to obtain information, and only that information which can be expressed in words or numbers. Incidentally, I think that noises are even less studied than images. In Viet- nam I learnt to listen to noises; though one has to be careful that somebody doesn't come along and turns them into music."27 Before Your Eyes- Vietnam is in every respect aware of its margi- nality, and tries to conceptualize its relation to dominance. It is a film of the 1980s, because it carefully disentangles itself from the counter-strategies of struggle and resistance, wherever these dis- courses are defined as binary or based on equivalence. Likewise, it does not assume that marginal filmmaking can be anything other than a putting into crisis of the cinema's dominant codes, if neces- sary, by refusing the notion of representation as visibility and voice itself, so much part of the militant ideology of the 1970s: "It's easy to do something systematically, like a machine. And it is easy to do something new, and once only, like an aritst."28 The guerilla soldier is superior to the professional soldier because of his different relation to both time and space: "he withdraws into space, makes himself invisible; he withdraws into time, and tires out the enemy."29 Farocki, too, interrogates the Imaginary that is cine- ma, not by reference to a Symbolic situated on the side of truth or in the name of any theoretical practice, but by a guerilla tactic which might be called, borrowing from Paul Virilio, an "aesthetics of disap- pearance"30 which, coming after the disappearance of aesthetics, returns to sounds and images reality which for Mallarmé, speaking of flowers, was "absent from all the bouquets."31</page><page sequence="25">119 NOTES 1.
