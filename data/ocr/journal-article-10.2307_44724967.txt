Schneider Highway Safety Research Institute The University of Michigan Paul R. Rohr Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Dinesh Mohan Indian Institute of Technology ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to assess, by use of computer simulations, the effectiveness of motorcycle helmets in reducing head and neck injuries in motorcyclist impacts. The computer model used was the MVMA Two-D i mens i ona 1 Crash Victim Simulator. The study investigated a wide variety of impact conditions in order to establish a broad overall view of the effectiveness of helmets. It was found that helmet use invariably reduces dynamic responses which have a role in producing head injury and, in addition, almost always reduces the severity of neck response as well. For no configuration or condition does the helmet greatly increase the likelihood of neck injury. Thus, these similations of a wide spectrum of motorcyclist impacts provide further evidence that helmet use significantly reduces the likelihood and severity of both head and neck injuries. MOTORCYCLE CRASH INVESTIGATION data show that the use of helmets results in substantially fewer head injuries and fatalities (1)*. Few would disagree that helmets reduce the likelihood and severity of sharp and blunt trauma to the head resulting from head impacts. The effects on neck response of the addition of the helmet weight to that of the head, however, are not well understood. Many studies have indicated that the wearing of helmets does not increase the probability of sustaining neck injuries, but controversy on this point exists (2). It has been claimed that the mass of the helmet might cause increased loading of the neck structure during a crash event. Another view is simply that, apart from dynamic effects, if the head is protected, then greater energy must be absorbed by the neck. These views cannot be countered by ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. epidemiological data at the present time because of both the difficulty in diagnosing neck injury in those cases where the cyclist survives and lack of well-defined neck autopsy protocol in those cases where the cyclist dies. In the past few years, some opponents of mandatory helmet laws have used unsubstantiated claims of the adverse role of helmets in neck injury causation as partial justification for having the laws repealed. In a review article, Versace (2) stated that "while the evidence does not support the theory that the helmet is ε causal factor in the incidence of neck injury, the state-of-the-art does not provide sufficient data at this time which would indicate that the helmet does not increase the incidence of neck injury." It was the intended purpose of the study discussed by this paper to expand the state-of-the-art so that this question and others pertaining to helmet use can be answered** . The research project described here had the following goals: 1) to address previously unanswered questions regarding neck response for helmeted and unhelmeted head impacts; 2) to model a range of cyclist impact situations accurately enough to provide useful quantitative measures of both head and neck responses; 3) to provide a basis for limited statements relating to helmet design; and finally, k) to establish a broad overall view of the effectiveness of helmet use by investigating the potential of the helmet to both detrimentally and beneficially affect head and neck response. COMPUTER SIMULATION METHODS THE MVMA TWO-DIMENSIONAL CRASH VICTIM SIMULATION MODEL - Computer simulations of motorcycle driver horizontal and vertical surface impacts were made with the MVMA Two- Dimensional Crash Victim Simulator, developed at the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute (3)» W » (5))· This model **A more detailed report on this study is the reference by Bowman and Schneider ( 1 980) (12) . 3318 0096-736X/82/9004-331 8$02 .50 Copyright 1982 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">has been used in a number of studies over the past seven years. These include studies which concentrated on head/neck response (6) , (7) » (8). In a recent study (Snyder, Foust, and Bowman, 1977) (9)» (10), (11), the model was used for simulation of impact events of much the same type as those investigated in the current study. Included in the study by Snyder, et al., were head impacts (unhelmeted) of human free- fall victims against unyielding "ground" surfaces. In that study, the ability of the model to predict accurately the dynamic response for impacts of this type was demonstrated by simulation of drop tests of instrumented anthropomorphic dummies. The study by Snyder, et al., provided the basis for development of b i omechan i ca 1 and anthropometric data that were used in the present study. The MVMA 2-D CVS model body linkage is illustrated in Figure 1. The model includes the following features in its representation of the human body: 1) A nine-mass, ten-segment body linkage; 2) An extensible, two-joint neck and realistically flexible shoulder complex; 3) Energy-absorbing joints; 4) Time-dependent muscle activity 1 eve 1 ; 5) Contact-sensing ellipses of specifiable size, position, and number which define the body prof île; and 6) General and arbitrarily definable nonlinear materials with energy-absorbing capability for all parts of the body. ANTHROPOMETRIC AND Β I OMECHAN I CAL DATA - Figure 2 illustrates most of the anthropometric measures used in development of an MVMA 2-D linkage data set for a 50th percentile adult male of the motorcycle driver impact simulations. The measures indicated (and others such as link masses and moments of inertia) were available from various anthropometric studies. All simulations in the current study involve head or chest impacts, so aspects of the b i omechan i ca 1 model that are of particular importance are loading and unloading characteristics of the head and chest and also neck properties. These will now be discussed br i ef 1 y . HEAD PROPERTIES - McElhaney, et al. (13), (14) reported frontal and lateral skull load- deflection curves measured by Messerer (15)· These frontal stat i c loading curves, for twelve fresh, intact cadaver skulls (all adults), were approximated for use in this study by a bilinear loading curve which was stiffened by a factor of 1.5 as an adjustment appropriate for dynami c impact loading. The method used for establishing this adjustment accounts for the fact that static loading results in flexure of the total skull while an impact loading curve must represent a more local skull deformation. The resulting parameterized loading curve is illustrated in Figure 3· Fracture parameters (p ( "Jfx) φ Θ éM6 0 ////////////////////////////// Fig. 1 - MVMA 2-D Crash Victim Simulator body linkage head length head ci rcumřerence ' 1 - *~ ' C* j head-neck height ι ļ CG location below I / | 'l top of head i I ? ι ! //"Φ i i f ! ι I m f ' I ' n ~~ I I sitting f / m 0 ļ n ~~ j height / j I total torso ļ ļ chest depth !

Skull fracture was not attained in any of the computer simulations in this study. With regard to unloading characteristics, the skull was modeled as perfectly elastic for very small deflections and with energy absorption increasing linearly to 20 percent for complete unloading from a deflection near fracture. CHEST PROPERTIES - Lobdell, et al. (15) 3319</page><page sequence="3">3320 Β. Μ. BOWMAN, ET AL* report blunt impact force-deflection response of the chest for male and female, embalmed and unembalmed cadavers. Figure b illustrates the parameterized loading curve derived for this study from those data. Those test data were also used to estimate unloading parameters. For the simulations, elastic unloading was assumed through the first 0.5 inches of deflection. The energy restitution coefficient for unloading from a two-inch deflection was 0.5 and was varied linearly to 0.25 for a b.ļ inch deflection. Permanent deformation upon complete unloading was also modeled. NECK JOINT PROPERTIES - Resistance to motion between adjacent body links is present in joint structures of the human body. Resistance results from deformation of both soft and hard connective tissues, increasing when musculature acting about the joint is contracted. Neck joint properties for the simulations were determined from the results of a study by Mertz and Patrick (17) which investigated the strength and dynamic response of the human neck. Figure 5 shows their recommended "baseline" curve for 50th percentile males for the effective moment at the occipital condyles versus the relative head/torso angle. The illustrated loading curves were used to derive data for the two- joint, one-link neck in the MVMA 2-D Crash Victim Simulation model. Mertz and Patrick also present data pertaining to the relationship between hysteretic energy absorption and head- torso angle from which a pi ecewi se- 1 i near approximation was derived. Permanent deformation of soft and hard joint tissues was similarly represented. THE HELMET MODEL - The helmet model used in this study was simple but adequate for investigating the primary questions of the study, viz., the effects of adding mass and moment of inertia to the head and the effects of basic helmet parameters such as lining stiffness, shell smoothness, and overall helmet d i mens i ons . A standard size fullface Bell helmet was modeled by effectively increasing the dimensions of the motorcyclist's head. The helmet was given an elliptical shape. No distinction was made in the model between the face area and the part of the elliptical profile which properly represents shell surface. (It was unnecessary to make any such distinction since all simulations were to be for helmet/surface impact). Possible slipping between the motorcyclist's head and the liner was not considered because helmets normally fit very snugly and because the integrated friction force (torque) for the head/liner interface is much greater than that for the shel 1 / i mpacted surface i nterf ace . The mass of the head link of the motorcyclist model was increased by the mass of the helmet, the location of the center of gravity was adjusted to account for the helmet, and the head/helmet moment of inertia about the adjusted center of gravity location was determined by analytically combining the inertia parameters of the separate elements.

Measurements for helmet inertia parameters were made in HSR I 1 s biomaterials laboratory using a standard Bell helmet. The helmet model assumed a rigid shell but represented a one-inch thick liner by a material with loading and unloading properties measured by Kingsbury (I9) using an aluminum head form inside a helmet. Kingsbury (19), (20) finds that the loading stiffness of polystyrene helmet liners is only slightly sensitive to rate of loading. The quasi-static loading curve used in the simulations is shown in Figure 6. The curve in the figure approximates loading for a Bell Star helmet liner and is representative of liners used by other manufacturers. Unloading characteristics were estimated from Kingsbury data. As previously described for other unloading curves, the energy restitution coefficient and permanent deformation ratio were defined as ρ i ecew i se- 1 i near functions of maximum def 1 ec t i on . Even though, as previously explained, the helmet shape and inertia properties were modeled by simply enlarging the head, it is possible to account for the separate influences of skull and helmet liner loading curves in the MVMA 2-D model. Distinct skull and liner deflections were determined in the simulations. MATRIX OF SIMULATIONS SIMULATION CONFIGURATIONS - Four basic situations were selected for simulation to provide an understanding of how the head and neck would respond for the helmeted and unhelmeted cases. Figure 7 illustrates these four different model configurations -- A, B, C, and D. In A, the cyclist is moving horizontally in a seated position, and the head impacts a vertical rigid surface simulating the back of a truck. In B, the cyclist is also in the seated position moving with a horizontal velocity and impacts the rigid vertical surface with the chest so that the head and neck are inertially loaded. In both of these cases a secondary impacting surface which angles off from the lower edge of the primary surface has been modeled to prevent other parts of the body from wrapping around the primary impact surface. For the basic run configuration for these two cases, the head and neck are initially oriented so that the neck is flexed forward 30 degrees from the vertical torso line at the C 7 ~T 1 joint (2) and the head is extended back 10 degrees from the neck line at the condyles joint (1) .* This results in the head being oriented at a 70 degree angle to the horizontal just prior to i mpact . In C and D, the cyclist strikes a horizontal rigid "road" surface while moving with both horizontal and vertical velocities. In C, the torso of the cyclist is at an angle of 30 degrees to the road; the angle is 70 degrees »The "head line" is a line perpendicular to the Frankfort plane. Fig. 6 - Load vs. displace- ment for helmet liner for configuration D. For both configurations the lower neck joint (C 7 "~T 1 ) is flexed forward 20 degrees and the upper neck joint is extended backward 20 degrees. This results in the initial head angle relative to the road being the same as the torso angle relative to the road -- 30 degrees for configuration C and 70 degrees for D . MATRIX OF RUNS - Table 1 illustrates the basic run matrix utilizing these four impact configurations for helmeted and unhelmeted impacts. All impacts for this basic set were for horizontal velocities of 20 mph (29-3 ft/ sec). The two road impact runs had vertical impact velocities of 19*6 ft/sec. corresponding to a fall height of six feet and also initial rotational velocities of 100 deg/sec for all body segments, estimated to be typical for cyclist-road impacts of the type simulated. For chest impacts the coefficient of friction between the chest and truck surface was .35 for all runs. For the head impacts against the truck surface the coefficients of friction were set to .3 and .1 for unhelmeted and helmeted simulations, respectively. For road impacts in this basic matrix the coefficients of friction between the head and road were set to .6 and .2 for unhelmeted and helmeted impacts, respectively. Neck muscle tension for these basic runs was constant at 50 percent of maximum effort in isometric exertion. The full study also included many simulations made from an "expanded run matrix" (12). Those simulations investigated the effects of variations of baseline conditions, viz., horizontal and vertical impact velocities, muscle tension level, head and helmet coefficient of friction with the struck surface, initial rotational velocity, and initial head/ neck orientation.

HUMAN INJURY TOLERANCE While comparisons of simulation results for impacts with and without helmets can, by themselves, provide a good understanding of the relative benefits and detriments of wearing helmets, statements on the absol ute benefits or detriments of helmets or on the absol ute significance of helmet design parameters and impact conditions cannot be made unless human injury tolerance measures are considered. Comparison of predicted dynamic responses from the simulations with values for human injury tolerance limits allows, to some extent, an assessment of the likelihood and/or degree of injury that would result for the situation s imulated. Injury tolerance measures pertinent to this study are ones which relate to dynamic response of the head and neck. Dynamic responses determined by the MVMA 2-D Crash Victim Simulation model include HIC and peak magnitudes for head center of gravity resultant acceleration, head angular acceleration, impact force on the head, neck compression force, positive and negative neck shear forces, and flexion and extension torques in the neck. These are all of interest because they have a pr i or i potential of correlating with degree or likelihood of injury. Unfortunately, there is not yet universal agreement among researchers as to which measures are the best injury predictors. For those measures for which there is some agreement, the data substantiating tolerance limits are minimal and sometimes conflicting. However, for several dynamic response parameters which are generally agreed to be useful injury indicators, injury tolerance levels for use in this study were established from limited available data. HEAD INJURY CRITERION (HIC) - The Head Injury Criterion, or HIC, is an integrated measure of exposure to linear acceleration, i.e., its value is determined by considering magnitude of the acceleration, shape of the acceleration-time profile, and duration of exposure. HIC has found wide acceptance as the quantity related to whole body dynamics which best predicts degree and likelihood of brain damage. A concussion Injury tolerance level of HIC * 1000 was set by NHTSA in June 1372 by Department of Transportation NHTSA Docket Number 69-7, Notice 19, Occupant Crash Protection Head Injury Criterion S6.2 of FMVSS 208 (21). OCCIPITAL CONDYLES TORQUE TOLERANCES - The neck injury tolerance data used for interpreting simulation results come from the previously mentioned study by Mertz and Patrick (15) . Mertz and Patrick determined torques, shear forces, and axial forces at the occipital condyles. They found that shear and axial forces at the condyles do not correlate with degree of trauma, but they give occipital condyles torque tolerances for both flexion and extens i on. For flexion, Mertz and Patrick give I68O in-lbs as a torque not large enough to cause ligamentous, disc, or bone damage. Thus, it should be considered a conservative lower bound for an injury tolerance limit. For extension at the condyles, 50^ in-lbs was established as a large enough torque to cause minor ligamentous damage and was therefore recommended as the injury tolerance level for extens i on. RESULTS SIMULATION DATA - In order to facilitate studying the effects of varying parameter values and run conditions, three types of computer- generated output were obtained to supplement the standard MVMA 2-D CVS printout of tabular time histories for dynamic response variables. A table is generated for each computer run which summarizes the positive and negative peak response values along with times of occurrence</page><page sequence="7">3324 Β· Μ.

Tables of a second type of supplementary output compare the peak positive and negative magnitudes for dynamic responses for 69 pairs of contrasted runs. Finally, plots were obtained for each of the seventeen response variables described in Table 2. Each plot shows responses for a pair of contrasted runs. For assessing the effectiveness of the use of helmets, helmet vs. no-helmet comparisons were examined not only for the baseline conditions but also for many different variations about baseline conditions. Results for 22 different comparisons of helmet and no- helmet simulations are presented graphically in Figures 28 through 36· These figures include information for all four of the basic impact configurations studied, and each separate figure compares the peak values for a different response variable that has the potential for indicating head or neck injury (see Table 2). Vertical dashed lines indicate th injury tolerance limits previously described. HEAD-TRUCK IMPACTS - The general motion of the cyclist's body and head and neck during head-truck impacts is illustrated in Figure 8, which is for the helmet baseline simulation. The upper neck joint initially goes into flexion. This is followed by hyperextens i on at both the upper and lower neck. There is high probability of serious brain injury for the 20 mph head impact of a seated motorcyclist against a vertical, rigid "truck" surface. The HIC responses (Figure 28) indicate this to be equally true for helmeted and unhelmeted motorcyclists despite the fact that peak head resultant accelerations are reduced by about one-half by the helmet. At 10 mph, however, the benefit of the helmet with respect to reducing HiC exposure is definite: HIC is reduced by 78 percent from a potentially dangerous level to a non- i njur i ous level. The other responses (Figures 29 through 38) also show generally greater relative benefits for the helmet at 10 mph than at 20 mph, although the differences are not as dramatic as for HIC. Overall, for 10 and 20 mph head-truck impacts, head resultant accelerations and angular accelerations are reduced by one-third to two-thirds. Peak head contact force is reduced approximately 1100 to 1200 lbs regardless of impact conditions. Neck compression/elongation forces are consistently smaller for the helmet impacts, particularly at 10 mph, but the maximum force levels for this impact configuration are not large compared with forces from road impacts even for the unhelmeted cyclist. There is little difference between shear forces at the upper neck for the helmeted</page><page sequence="8">HEAD/NECK IMPACT RESPONSE 3325 O 15 40 ^ 75 ^ TIME (MSEC) »- Fig. 8 - Head-truck impact (20 mph, with helmet) and unhelmeted cyclists, but at the lower neck shear force levels are greater for the helmeted cyclist, although not significantly so. The most significant neck torques resulting from this type of impact are for extension at the upper neck, where magnitudes exceed the injury tolerance level even at 10 mph for the unhelmeted cyclist, but not for the helmeted cyclist. At 20 mph, peak extension torques are, greater (double) than the injury tolerance level for the helmeted cyclist also, but for all conditions the peak torque is reduced by the helmet. Peak flexion torques at the upper neck, on the other hand, are significantly greater for the helmeted cyclist, although magnitudes only just reach the injury tolerance level. At the lower neck, torques are in extension only and are comparable for helmet and no-helmet condi tions. Figures 9 through 12 show helmet/no-helmet plot comparisons of some of the dynamic response variables for the basel i ne head-truck impact simulations. CHEST-TRUCK IMPACTS - Figure 13 illustrates the cyclist motions resulting from chest-truck impact. The sequence of schematics shown is for the no-helmet baseline simulation, but the same type of motion occurs for helmet simulations and for all variations about baseline conditions. In chest impacts of the seated, helmeted motorcyclist, where direct impact of the head does not occur, dynamic response does not, of course, depend on helmet liner properties. For impacts of this type only the mass and rotational inertia of the helmet cause the head and neck response to be different from that for an unhelmeted cyclist. For various conditions simulated, acceleration-related responses are decreased by the helmet. In particular, peak head angular accelerations are approximately one-third smaller for the helmeted cyclist and although there is virtually no effect on peak head resultant accelerations, HIC values are reduced by up to 26 percent for 20 mph impacts. (HIC responses are not illustrated in Figure 28 since values are not large for this type of impact (400 to 600 for 20 mph) and since HIC is usually not considered a meaningful index for long- duration accelerations not resulting from direct head impact.) Peak values for most other response variables are moderately increased by the mass and rotational inertia of the helmet, but in general, magnitudes for both helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists are considerably smaller for this type of impact than for the other types simulated - particularly the road impacts. When the chest strikes the vertical "truck" surface, the head continues to move forward and the neck goes into flexion. Resulting neck elongation forces are about 10 percent greater for the helmeted cyclist, and, as would be expected, shear forces at the upper and lower neck are also greater, typically by 200 lbs and by from 30 to 200 percent. The only types of injuries of significant likelihood for this type of impact are neck injuries associated wih excessive neck torque levels. For upper neck flexion torques, the estimated tolerance level for ligamentous tearing is exceeded by from 75 to 100 percent in 20 mph helmeted-cycl i st impact simulations and by from 0 to 65 percent in unhelmeted-cycl i st simulations. Although the torque levels in flexion are somewhat increased by the helmet, it is the extension torques which result after rebound from forward head motion that are most serious for this type of impact. In Figure 35» peak upper neck extension torques do not exceed the injury tolerance limit because the simulations summarized in these figures were terminated at 100 msec - prior to rebound hyperextens i on. For the direct head impact configurations it was unnecessary to simulate response beyond 100 msec since peak magnitudes for responses occur relatively early. In 200 msec simulations for the 20 mph chest impacts, however, peak extension torques were found to occur at about 140 msec for the helmet case and at about 125 msec for the no-helmet case. The peak extension torque levels for the helmet and no-helmet cases were near 1 y i dent i cal at about</page><page sequence="9">3326 Β. Μ.

Most dramatic is the reduction of HIC levels: HIC values are 27OO-IIOOO for all conditions simulated for unhelmeted motorcyclists, greatly exceeding the 1000 tolerance level for brain injury (AIS &lt; 2), while values are reduced to 600-1400 in all simulations for helmeted motorcyclists. Percentage decreases of peak dynamic responses are remarkably consistent for the conditions simulated for low-angle road impacts. In comparison with impact of the unprotected head, the helmet liner effects reductions of 75~85 percent in HIC, 65-70 percent in head resultant acceleration, and 75~85 percent in head angular acceleration. Head contact force is typically reduced by about I6OO lbs, or 30-35 percent. Except for the case where the head and neck are in a pre-flexed orientation, there is typically a 75~90 percent reduction of upper neck extension torque. The effect of the helmet on peak upper neck flexion torque is more sensitive to conditions, varying from reduction by 44 percent to increase by 47 percent. If the head and neck are pre-flexed, the helmet increases upper neck extension torque by 148 percent but decreases the extension torque by 44 percent, in each case to a value slightly greater than the ligamentous injury tolerance limit. The helmet liner and helmet mass are primarily responsible for the reduction in peak values of head injury parameters (HIC, head resultant acceleration, head angular acceleration, head contact force). The low coefficient of friction between a helmet and the road and the attenuation of the contact force by the helmet together cause reductions in peak values of neck injury parameters, however. For this impact orientation a helmet/road friction coefficient of 0 to 0.3 is found to be optimal overall and minimizes neck compression force, neck shear forces, and neck torques by reducing the degree to which the body can drive into the neck following head impact. Figures 19 through 22 show helmet/no-helmet plot comparisons of some of the dynamic response variables for the basel i ne 30 degree road impact simulations. 70 DEGREE ROAD IMPACTS - The motions of the cyclist for helmet and no-helmet baseline simulations of high-angle road impacts are shown in Figure 23· Figures l8 and 23 show the basically different types of motions occurring in the low-angle (30°) and high-angle (70°) impacts. For the 70 degree impact, the friction force between the head or helmet and the road surface is sufficiently large that the horizontal momentum of the cyclist causes a tumbling over on the head and shoulders, while for 30 degrees the cyclist simply drops down i nto prone impact . There are many similarities in dynamic responses for the low-angle and high-angle road impacts, and also many distinct differences. Figures 28 through 1) show similar magnitudes at 30-degree and 70-degree impact angles for responses related to prediction of head or brain injury. Further, for these responses, the relative benefits of helmet attenuation of impact forces are similar for the two body orientations; at 70 degrees the helmet causes reductions in comparison with impacts of the unhelmeted head of 60-90 percent in HIC, 5O-8O percent in head resultant acceleration, and 50-70 percent in head angular acceleration. These ranges are broader, extending to somewhat lower values (less relative helmet benefit),</page><page sequence="12">HEAD/NECK IMPACT RESPONSE 3329 3-HEPD ANGULAR ACCELERA' :GN CHEST IMPACT - 20 MPH - PIGIO TRUCK 5 PC Κ l56~ SOV, MT. .

Head contact force is reduced by amounts in the range 1200 to 2000 lbs, always by about 35 percent. Peak magnitudes of most neck response variables for the 30-degree and 70-degree impact angles are quite dissimilar, and also the effect of the helmet on neck responses is very different for the two impact angles. While neck compression force magnitudes are not greatly different for 30 degree and 70 degree impacts and while the helmet does have a clear beneficial effect at 70 degrees, the relative benefit of the helmet is not nearly as great as for 30 degree impacts; i.e., the compression force magnitudes from helmet and no-helmet simulations are more nearly equal at 70 degrees. There is little difference overall at 70 degrees between neck shear forces for the helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists, while at 30 degrees neck shear forces are reduced mapkedly for the helmeted cyclist. Figures 35 and 3&amp; show that a helmet causes little overall improvement in neck torque levels for high-angle impacts. As rollover on the head occurs following initial impact, neck flexion torques increase markedly for both the helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists, typically to about twice the injury tolerance limit. Flexion torques are made slightly worse at the upper neck and improved somewhat at the lower neck by the helmet. Peak extension torques at the upper neck occur prior to flexion peaks for helmet impacts and after the flexion peaks for no-helmet impacts; the helmet causes overall reduction of these torques. As for the 30 degree road impacts, simulations for 70 degree road impacts show that there is a range of optimal values for helmet/ road friction coefficient for minimizing neck compression force, torques, and shear forces. Values from 0.4 to 0.8 yield similar results overall for the high angle impact. Figures 24 through 27 show helmet/no-helmet plot comparisons of some of the dynamic response variables for the base 1 i ne 70 degree road impact s imul at i ons . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The simulations of this study predict that helmet use in general will cause marked decreases in dynamic response peak magnitudes for typical motorcyclist impacts. With few exceptions, exposure levels are either reduced for the helmeted cyclist or unchanged. Only for direct chest impacts resulting in inertial loading of the head and neck do neck injury responses for the helmeted cyclist generally exceed those for the unhelmeted cyclist, and then not by significant amounts. Attenuation of responses is in most instances great enough that there is significant reduction of the likelihood that head or neck injury will occur, and injury that does occur is much less severe. SUMMARY - The MVMA Two-Dimens ional Crash Victim Simulation computer model was used to study four types of impact configurations for both helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists. A 20 mph horizontal velocity was used for the baseline condition for each configuration. For road impact simulations, a six-foot trajectory height baseline was used for the ejected cyclist. The major findings from helmet/no-helmet comparisons for these impact configurations are mostly derived from the summary bar charts, Figures 28 through 36, and are listed below: Head-Truck Impacts 1. Serious brain injury is very likely for direct 20 mph head-truck impact for e i ther the helmeted or unhelmeted cyclist. A helmet reduces peak head resultant acceleration by one- half, but HIC is only slightly reduced, from 35OO to 33OO. 2. With regard to reducing HIC values, a helmet is most effective at lower impact velocities. At_ _1_0 mph , i t reduces H I C by almost 80 percent from a dangerous 1 eve! , 2600, to a non- i η i ur i ous 1 eve 1 , 1 ess than 6OO . 3. Peak head contact force is reduced by 1100 to 1200 lbs for the helmeted cyclist regardless of impact conditions. 4. Peak upper neck flexion torques are higher for the helmeted cyclist but less than the injury tolerance limit even for 20 mph i mpacts . 5. At 10 mph, peak upper neck extension torque for the unhelmeted cycl i st i s about 75 percent i η excess of the i n i ury toi erance limit whereas a helmet reduces the torque to about 15 percent 1 ess than the i η jury toi erance 1 i m i t . At 20 mph, large extension torques indicate high likelihood of neck injury for both the helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists, but the injury tolerance level is exceeded by much less for the helmeted cyclist -- 100 percent compared to I50 percent . Chest-Truck Impacts 1. In chest-truck impacts, acceleration- related responses are decreased by the helmet. Levels are not dangerously high, however, even for the unhelmeted cyclist at 20 mph. 2. Neck response variables are moderately increased by the helmet, but 1 evel s for both helmeted and unhelmeted cyc 1 i sts are general 1 y srna 1 1 er for chest-truck impacts than for the other types of impacts s i mul ated . 3· Upper neck flexion torques exceed the injury tolerance level by up to 100 percent for the helmeted cyclist and by up to 65 percent for the unhelmeted cyclist. 4. The most 1 i kel y i η jury from th i s type of i mpact resul ts from rebound hyperextens i on of the upper neck, where torque 1 evel s are equal for the helmeted and unhelmeted cycl i sts at about five times the injury tolerance level. 30 Degree Road Impacts 1. For low-angle road impacts, peak val ues for a 1 1 i n i ury-rel ated dynami c responses are reduced dramat i cal 1 y by helmet attenuat i on of i mpact forces . 2. HIC greatly exceeds 1000, indicating high likelihood of serious brain injury, for al 1 conditions simulated for unhelmeted motorcyclists. Typical values are 5OOO to 8OOO. HIC values are reduced to below I500 in al 1 simulations for he lmeted motorcyclists,</page><page sequence="18">HEAD/NECK IMPACT RESPONSE 3335 3-HERO RNGULAR ACCELERATION ROPO IMPACT - 20 MPH-6 FT.

For conditions simulated, the helmet effects reductions of 75~85 percent in H1C values. 3. The helmet reduces head resultant acceleration by 65~70 percent and head angular acceleration by 75~85 percent. 4. Head contact force is typically reduced by about 1600 lbs, or 30-35 percent by the he 1 met . 5. Peak upper neck flexion torque is sometimes decreased and sometimes increased by the helmet, but torque levels, in general, are considerably less than the injury tolerance limit for both the helmeted and unhelmeted cyc 1 i sts . 6. For most conditions peak upper neck extension torque is 10 times the injury tolerance limit for the unhelmeted cyclist but is reduced by a helmet to levels only slightly exceeding the tolerance limit. Reductions are typically 75~90 percent. 7. The relatively low coefficient of friction between a helmet and the road is partly responsible for the reductions in peak values of neck injury parameters. A friction coefficient of 0 to 0.3 is optimum. 70 Degree Road I mpacts 1 · H i gh-ang 1 e road i mpacts are more severe than 1 ow-ang 1 e i mpacts w i th respect to near 1 y a 1 1 i η jury-rei ated dynami c responses , part i cul ar 1 y neck i n i ury parameters .

Peak torque levels at the</page><page sequence="25">3342 Β. Μ. BOWMAN, ET AL. upper neck are typically about twice the injury tolerance limit for both helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists. Upper neck flexion torque is normally somewhat increased by a helmet. At the lower neck, flexion torques are even greater but are consistently smaller for the helmeted cyclist. 6. Peak upper neck extension torques are normally less than the injury toleance limit and normally smaller for the helmeted cyclist. For some conditions the helmet prevents probable hyperextens i on injury. Lower neck extension torques are less than the upper neck torques. 7. For the 70 degree impact orientation, peak neck compression force, torques, and shear forces decrease as helmet/road coefficient of friction is increased (within limits). A friction coefficient larger than that for a typical helmet is found to be optimal overall for 70 degree impacts, the best values lying in the range 0.4 to 0.8. The effects of varying input parameter values away from baseline conditions were studied in order to establish sensitivity of dynamic responses to varied conditions in real- world motorcyclist impacts. This part of the study has not been examined in this paper but is discussed in detail in the full report. In no case did the simulation results from any of these parameter variations lead to significant alterations in conclusions regarding the general effectiveness of the helmet derived from results of the baseline simulations. The major findings from variation of parameters for impact conditions are listed below: Head/He 1 met-Road Fr i et i on Coef f i c i ent 1. Even a small coefficient of friction is sufficient to cause rollover on the head and shoulders (tumbling) for 70 degree road impacts. Prone body impacts always result for a 30 degree impact orientation unless the coefficient of friction is unreal i st i cal 1 y far in excess of 1 .0. 2. A helmet-road surface coefficient of friction of 0.3 to 0.4 is suggested as optimal overall for minimizing exposure levels in real- world accidents. Lower values are better for low-angle impacts and higher values are better for high-angle impacts. Road I mpact Angl e: 30 Degrees vs . 70 Degrees 1. Overall dynamic response is much different for low and high body angles at impact. Tumbling occurs for high-angle impact but not for, low-angle impact. 2. Neck responses are very different for the two impact orientations. With regard to neck trauma, the 30 degree impact is the more severe for an unhelmeted cyclist, while the 70 degree impact is the more severe for a helmeted cyc list. 3. With regard to brain injury, the 70 degree impact is the more severe for both helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists. HIC values are about 3·5 times as large at 70 degrees as at 30 degrees for the helmeted cyclist and 1.8 times as large for the unhelmeted cyclist. Head/Neck Initial Or i entat i on 1. For head-truck impacts, only minor differences result in dynamic response peak magnitudes if the neck is initially flexed in comparison with the baseline head/neck or i entat i on. 2. For chest-truck impacts, peak neck flexion and extension torques increase, in general, with initial neck extension and decrease with increased initial neck flexion. 3. For 30 degree road impacts, initial neck flexion relative to the baseline head/neck orientation causes significant increases of upper and lower neck peak flexion torques while reducing peak extension torques - markedly for the unhelmeted cyclist. 4. For 70 degree road impacts, initial neck flexion causes reduction of upper and lower neck peak flexion and extension torques for both helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists. For the helmeted cyclist, initial neck flexion causes HIC values to be reduced to one-fourth of the baseline value. Only a small reduction in HIC values occurs for the unhelmeted cyclist. Muse 1 e Tens i on 1 . For the 10 mph head-truck and chest- truck impacts, varying muscle activity level from 50 percent of maximum isometric potential to 10 percent has negligible effect on dynamic response peak magnitudes. 2. At 20 mph effects of varying muscle tension are slightly larger but still insignificant except for the 70 degree road impact, where HIC values are decreased by 3^ percent for the lower muscle tension level. Initial Rotat i ona 1 Veloc i ty 1. Only small effects on dynamic response are seen from varying initial rotational velociy between 0 and 100 deg/sec for 30 degree road impacts . 2. Effects are even smaller for 70 degree impacts . Hor i zontal Vel oc i ty : 10 mph vs . 20 mph 1. Head-truck impacts at 10 mph produce peak magnitudes of injury-related dynamic response variables that are 40 to 80 percent less than at 20 mph. For a helmeted cyclist, the HIC is less than 600 at 10 mph - 83 percent lower than the HIC at 20 mph. Helmet use as against nonuse has much greater relative benefit for a 10 mph horizontal velocity than for 20 mph . 2. For chest-truck impacts, dynamic response peak magnitudes are 50 to 90 percent smaller for 10 mph impacts than for 20 mph. Most significantly, upper neck torques are reduced by about 70 percent. For 10 mph impacts, exposure levels for all dynamic response variables are below injury tolerance limits for both helmeted and unhelmeted cyc 1 i sts . 3. Horizontal velocity is a minor factor for road impacts, particularly low-angle impacts . Fall Hei qht : Three Feet vs . S i χ Feet 1. The dynamic responses for road impacts for three-foot and six-foot trajectory heights are quite similar in character, the major differences being in peak magnitudes. 2. For 30-degree road-helmet impacts, peak magnitudes of most accelerations, forces, and</page><page sequence="26">HEAD/NECK IMPACT RESPONSE 3343 torques are roughly 1.3 times as large for a six-foot trajectory height as for a three-foot height. The HIC is 2.2 times as large. 3. For 70-degree road-helmet impacts, dynamic response peak magnitudes are roughly 1.5 times as large for a six-foot fall height as for three feet. The HIC is 2.4 times as large. CONCLUSIONS - Through computer simulation of the dynamic impact response of helmeted and unhelmeted motorcyclists for a wide variety of impact conditions, this study has established a broad overall view of the effectiveness of helmet use. The potential of the helmet to both beneficially and detrimentally affect head and neck response has been investigated. The analysis of simulation results indicates that a helmet will invariably lessen the exposure levels of dynamic responses which have a role in producing head injury and, in addition, will almost always reduce the severity of neck response as well. For no simulation configuration or condition does the helmet greatly increase the likelihood of neck injury. Thus, these simulations of a wide spectrum of motorcyclist impacts provide further evidence that helmet use significantly reduces the likelihood and severity of both head and neck i nj ury .
