In the re-analysis if engraved schist pebbles from the Moravian Magdalenian, we found a specimen with an engraved tangle of straight and curved lines, in which two miniature female figures can be recognised. A complete figure can be seen at the right margin of the engraving, with its front part turned right. In the lower part it is intersected by a second typically curved line, which, however, lacks the anterior part. It is very unlikely that we will identify the meaning of these engravings and the relationship between the figural motifs and the linear scribble around them. It is, however, possible that they were engraved to form meaningful compositions based on customs and rites of that time. This article is a reprint of a previously published article (Valoch K., 1978: Anthropologie (Brno) 16, 1: 31–33).

The next one among linear scribbles on slate slabs (Bosinski, Fischer is a stick-like stylised female figurine with indicated 1974) motivated us to re-check the engraved schist breasts from Rytířská Cave, perforated and used as pebbles from the Moravian Magdalenian, which were a pendant, made of bone (Valoch 1965a: Fig. I:1, 1965b: published some years ago (Valoch 1961).

The connection between zoomorphic and anthropomorphic depictions and tangled scribbles was recently accentuated by P. Leonardi (1976) who also gave many examples of this phenomenon (loc. cit., 81 sq., Figs. 43–65). Among them is a female figure of the Dr. Karel Valoch same style from La Gare de Couze (loc. cit., Fig. 48) and Anthropos Institute a wall engraving from Gouy Cave (loc. cit., Fig. 41), Moravské museum which also includes elements of such a figure hidden in Brno a tangle of lines. In another composition then a complete female depiction of this kind can be recognised (Martin 1972: Fig. 69). It is very unlikely that we will identify the meaning of these engravings and the relationship between the figural motifs and the linear scribble around them.
