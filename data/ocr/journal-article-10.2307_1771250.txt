<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPRING 1998 Volume 50, Number 2 YONG REN Cosmogony, Fictionality, Poetic Creativity: Western and Traditional Chinese Cultural Perspectives S THERE A CONCEPT of poetic creation in traditional Chinese literary criticism that is commensurable, or at least compatible, with that of the West? This decade's scholars of Chinese literature have tended to respond negatively to this question, arguing that while Western poets see themselves as creators of new worlds, Chi- nese poets are content with their empirical experiences with this world and have little regard for abstraction and imagination. Chi- nese poets are therefore not "creative" in that they do not initiate, but merely respond, as preconditioned receptacles, to outside stimuli. These critics argue that while tropes in Western poetry im- ply fictionality by alluding to an unseen "other," the figurative use of language in China constitutes only an effort to enact or "redis- cover" relationships and categories already existent in the "real" world. These arguments appear to share the assumption that a culture's cosmology determines its poetic and critical conceptualizations. It has been observed that Chinese culture seems unique in not having a significant tradition of creation myth. While Andrew Plaks cautions against assuming the absence of creation myth in early China, he nonetheless attributes the lack of narrative impulse in Chinese literature, even in such a massive narrative work as The Dream of the Red Chamber, to the absence of an "actor" figure in Chinese mythology (17). Plaks argues thatjust as</page><page sequence="2">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/99 the two-layer structure of Western allegory and metaphor, which aims at rendering "one plane of existence intelligible in terms of another" (95), is deeply rooted in the dualistic Western worldview predicated on the separation between phenomenal and transcen- dent realities, so the self-generating and holistic nature of the Chi- nese conception of the universe predetermines the characteristics of the Chinese poetic vision, which has a wide-angled perception of the universal interrelatedness of things but lacks "vertical depth" (110). Although Plaks maintains that Westerners and Chi- nese are equally concerned with the invisible, the only difference being the direction of their epistemological gaze, the dichotomy he describes between Western and Chinese poetic experiences- such as practical versus idealistic, "this worldly" versus "other- worldly"-opens the door for far more daring claims about the "uncreative" nature of Chinese poetry. In his Traditional Chinese Poetry and Poetics: Omen of the World, Stephen Owen perceives radically different poetic conditions in the "created" and the "uncreated" universes: In the created world little "makers," the poets, bear a strange relation to the pri- mal Maker, and their vaunted singularity in humankind apes a divine singularity. With no creative deity to emulate, the poet of the shih does not think to make the world anew; ...he lacks the "creative" poet's aura of isolated divinity. (84) Confined within a world of endlessly interwoven patterns, the Chi- nese poet not only lacks the imaginative engine of his Western counterpart, but also gains little to compensate for such percep- tive deficiency because much of the world "at hand" is already known; only minor details remain to be discovered (86). Poetic composition, in this opaque environment, results from a relatively passive effort of "reading" the world and faithfully recording im- pressions of external reality and internal experience. Reading po- etry, on the other hand, is a process of viewing "transparencies" in which the reader confidently sees things through the eyes of the poet with the intention of recovering a historical moment of real- ity (57). In her influential studies of allegory and metaphor in Chinese literature, Pauline Yu also attributes what she perceives as Chinese poetry's lack of interest in the abstract and the otherworldly to a "nondualistic cosmology" ("Allegory" 40). If traditional Chinese scholars have been "insisting on specifying historical sources and references for any poet's work," they do so not by choice, but by necessity: "[G]iven the lack of a notion of creation ex nihilo and of fictionality (owing perhaps to the conspicuous lack in indigenous Chinese cosmogonic thinking of a creator figure), these were the only plausible explanations for the genesis of a literary text" (411). The Chinese world, as Yu depicts it, is one of chaotic whole-</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/100 ness, with only apparent differences but no real distinctions: "There are no disjunctures between true reality and concrete real- ity, nor between concrete reality and literary work..." (Reading 35). In more recent years, these conclusions about the uncreative na- ture of Chinese poetry have been accepted by some critics as au- thoritative. For instance, Siu-kit Wong declares in his essay on Wenxin diaolong that although much of Liu Xie's critical work deals with what in the West would be called the "creative process," it would be inappropriate to apply this term to Liu Xie's thought, since "'creative process' implies an analogy which does not apply in the Chinese case" (890). Similarly, David Polumbo-Liu claims that "the Western literary tradition has valued the creative power of the poet to shape and fashion worlds that offer a vision of what is absent... [whereas] For the poet writing in medieval China, the poem was seen not as a substitution but as a corollary. The poem was an attempt not to create a vision of another realm but to ar- ticulate the affinities between various realms of experience" (189- 90). Chi Xiao, strongly influenced by Plaks, Owen, and Yu in his exploration of the "psycho-cultural quintessence of Chinese poetry" (18), insists that the traditional Chinese poet/critic perceives no distinction, or at least feels no need to distinguish, "between wild nature and human culture" (24), between natural order and literary convention (26-29), and between individual subjectivity and social/cultural intersubjectivity (25). The "quin- tessence" of Chinese poetry thus turns out to be a peculiar kind of perceptive obtuseness and hardheadedness, implying an unself- conscious and unimaginative mentality that responds with mechanical regularity to outside stimuli, or "archi-occasions," as Xiao calls them. On the other hand, scholars critical of the position taken by Owen and Yu tend to offer only indirect treatments of the concept of creativity in the Chinese cultural context. In his review of Yu's The Readings of Imagery in the Chinese Poetic Tradition, David McCraw challenges her rigid separation of East and West, but speaks with less certainty about a "Chinese concept" of poetic creation: "I be- lieve they still had a concept of creativity. After all, to 'make' and to 'create' are two different concepts" (133). He supports his argu- ment with only a few examples, some of which are taken from James Liu's The Interlingual Critic. By criticizing Yu's "tendency to confuse poetics and poetry" (132), McCraw seems to be confirm- ing Yu's observation that Chinese criticism lacks an articulated concept of poetic creation, even though this inadequacy does not necessarily entail a corresponding lack of creativity in the poetic process. Also severely critical of Yu's clear-cut demarcation be- tween Chinese monism and Western dualism, Jonathan Chaves complains that Yu "tries too hard to see a radical dichotomy be-</page><page sequence="4">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/101 tween Western ex nihilo creation and Chinese discovery of an al- ready existing lei relationship" and thereby "oversimplifies both China and the West" (79). Obviously, in this kind of debate, the issue continues to be defined in Yu's terms. The brief comment Zhang Longxi makes in his article "Out of the Cultural Ghetto: Theory, Politics and the Study of Chinese Literature," which might be seen as an intuitive and personal response, still adheres to Yu's definition of creativity in terms of fictionality: For those of us who read classical Chinese poetry and believe that our Li Bais and Du Fus were no less creative and imaginative, that is, capable of making a fictional world of their own in poetry, than their Dantes or Miltons or H1olderlins, it is somewhat disquieting to learn that our poets could only write poetry "based on a stimulus-response method of poetic production rather than a mimetic one." (86-7) Apparently, even though serious readers of Chinese poetry tend to find the arguments about its uncreative nature discomforting and unsettling, they can do no more than try to contextualize or reduce such arguments, in so far as they share their underlying critical assumptions. In this essay, I will reopen the issues of cos- mogony and fictionality, closely scrutinizing some of these as- sumptions. I will attempt to show that the idea that the concept of creation was nonexistent in ancient China is based on a narrow understanding of the term and that creation and creativity are in fact viable concepts in Chinese culture. More importantly, I will question the assumption that cosmogony determines critical thinking about creativity in Chinese culture and will also chal- lenge the notion that literary creation is an act of fiction making. This investigation, I hope, will also allow us to reflect on the broader theoretical issue of cultural essentialism and "difference." One of the disturbing results of efforts to inscribe the Chinese "difference," as I will attempt to show, is to attribute to Chinese authors and readers a less sophisticated ability to engage with po- etry than that of their Western counterparts. In this way, critics who are overtly intent on "defending" a particular non-Western literary tradition are ironically also the ones making radically dis- criminatory value judgments about that very tradition and its people's ability to read and write, and indeed to imagine. I It is a widely held observation that Chinese culture seems to have shown little interest in the possibility of cosmic creation. As Frederic Mote typically generalizes: The basic point which outsiders have found so hard to detect is that the Chinese, among all peoples ancient and recent, primitive and modern, are apparently unique in having no creation myth; that is, they have regarded the world and man as uncreated, as constituting the central features of a spontaneously self-generat- ing cosmos having no creator, god, ultimate cause or will external to itself...Moreover, other fundamentally different cosmogonies (explanations of the genesis of the cosmos)...made no significant impression on the Chinese mind</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/102 when encountered among South China minorities, or in successive contact with Indian, Islamic, and Christian thought. (17-18) There is, of course, much validity in this observation, although Mote is also cautious not to exclude the possibility that creation myths were influential in early China. The problem of studying Chinese mythology is that most of its surviving written records ap- peared rather late, when the activities of forming the intellectual foundation of Chinese culture had already been carried out. As Norman Girardot points out: "One of the greatest problems in dealing with mythology in China is that most of the ancient mytho- logical narratives handed down to modern scholarship had al- ready passed through the filters of the systematic Han [206 BC - AD 8] effort to collect and edit all the ancient texts..." (295). He further emphasizes that the nearly total absence of mythological accounts dating from the earlier periods of Chinese culture "is even more true with respect to authentic cosmogonic myths, since the preserved fragments are extremely meager and in most cases are secondary accounts historicized and moralized by the redac- tors of the Confucian School" (295). The paucity of surviving cos- mogonic accounts in particular might have been a result of harsher censorship due to the fact that cosmogonic assumptions were perceived as overtly offensive to the Confucian humanistic sensibility. In fact, as Plaks points out, there are "tantalizing indi- cations, both in textual fragments and in archaeological and an- thropological findings, to the effect that pre-literate Chinese cul- ture may have been rich in such elements as creation myth and anthropomorphic gods" (18). In The Development and Decline of Chi- nese Cosmology, John Henderson observes that "There is little rea- son to doubt that inhabitants of China from Neolithic times...personified natural forces" (2). It would not be unreason- able to assume also the existence of some influential notion of cos- mic creation as the bedrock of the apparently deeply religious cul- ture of the pre-Zhou era. As recorded in Lunyu, or The Analects, Confucius describes Yu, the legendary founder of the Xia Dynasty (ca 2100-ca 1600 BC), as one "completely devoted to the service of gods and deities" (Chap.8, 1:169). The Shangdi, or Lord-on-High, of the Shang Dynasty (ca 1600-ca 1200 BC) rulers, who controls the amount of rainfall and harvest and decides the outcome of all human affairs, also shows a cosmic dimension of its authority. Although the prevailing cosmogonic view in traditional Chinese culture is the naturalistic theory of spontaneous and continuous cosmic evolution as an internal process of interaction and trans- formation of the Yin and the Yang and the Five Elements, Chinese and Western worldviews are not diametrically opposed to each other. As Plaks points out: "We find the theme of spontaneous generation in many cultures, including ancient Greece, while the</page><page sequence="6">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/103 notion of creation ex nihilo has had rough going, to say the least, in Western theology" (18). In the Judeo-Christian tradition, philo- sophical or Platonic-Aristotelian readings of Genesis appear quite early in Jewish biblical exegesis, persisting into the Middle Ages to the extent that they constitute a "heterodoxy" in Jewish philo- sophical circles. In the latter, the concept of creation ex nihilo was considered absurd and incomprehensible. The tradition may be traced to the "first Jewish philosopher," Philo of Alexandria, who reveals that some philosophers of his time even denied that the universe was created. The convergence of Greek and Jewish cos- mological myths is evident in the Hellenistic-Jewish apocryphal book The Wisdom of Solomon, in which the God of the Bible is de- scribed as fashioning the world not from a vacuum, but out of pri- meval formless stuff. In the early Middle Ages, Jewish philosopher Gersonides (1288-1344) was the most outspoken about the con- ceptual difficulty involved with the ex nihilo hypothesis. Gersonides's basic point is that nature abhors a vacuum. Following Aristotle's rejection of the possibility of a vacuum in or outside of the physical universe, Gersonides believed that ex nihilo creation implies such a vacuum and is therefore false. In searching for an alternative solution, Gersonides found no other choice but to adopt Plato's model of creation out of matter, and he identified this primordial formless matter as the primeval waters mentioned in Genesis 1. Philosophers influenced by the Muslim thinker Averroes also tend to define ex nihilo creation in terms of the natural law of privation-as a process of generating being out of nonbeing. In an attempt to reconcile the biblical account of cre- ation with the Aristotelian thesis that the world is eternal, Isaac Albalag, a Jewish philosopher who lived in the latter half of the thirteenth century, contended that the universe is continuously created by its continuously creating cause, thus rejecting the as- sumption of temporal creation as a "faulty" doctrine (see Feldman). These interpretations of the Christian creation myth resemble the Chinese Daoist vision of the cosmic origin as Wu, or Nonbeing, the primal condition of the cosmos as hundun, or "chaos," and cosmic formation as a continuous process. Since Daoist texts tend to contain a quantitatively greater de- posit of mythological themes and images than do other pre-Qin writings, it is not surprising that some interesting cosmogonic con- cepts also emerge from this tradition. The most important one is that of Zaowuzhe, or the "Creator of Things," which has provoked some scholarly controversy. Although, as Benjamin Schwartz points out, critics tend to bypass the term by interpreting it as merely a "metaphor" for natural forces of cosmic movement, the "quasi-theistic" undertone in Zhuangzi's expression cannot easily be explained away (226). In chapter six of Zhuangzi, the Creator of</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/104 Things is portrayed as a Great Smith, who uses Heaven and Earth as his Great Furnace in forging the phenomenal world. Within the same context some other terms, such as Zaohua (Transformational Principle), Tian (Heaven), and Dakuai (Great Earth), also appear as interchangeable transcendental signifiers, which makes the cre- ator image more or less parabolic. Schwartz identifies the creator image with the more "creative," mystical, or "artistic" side of the Dao: "When Chuang-Tzu [Zhuangzi] concentrated his attention on the unique design, exuberant variety, and astonishing unique- ness of things, the metaphor of the tao as 'Creator' or 'creating power' somehow involved with the discrete particularity of things comes to mind,... [it is] something like an aesthetic-artistic appre- ciation of the uniqueness of creativity which is operative here" (228-29). It is of course desirable to contain and interpret Zhuangzi's thought within a manageable framework. But the term "Creator of Things" might very well be one of those "pieces of de- bris" surviving from antiquity, which Zhuangzi conveniently uses without feeling the need to define or redefine it. Still, the meta- phorical use of the creator figure deserves special attention when it appears in Zhuangzi's depiction of the ideal image of an in- spired author, like himself: His writing, superbly beautiful as it is, is perfectly harmonious without breach. His vocabularies vary, yet either gentle or extraordinary, they are all impressive. So much is his self-fulfillment, he writes and is unable to stop. Upwards, he plays with the Creator of Things; downwards, he befriends those who are beyond life and death and who have no beginning and end. (chap.33, 3:475)1 This must be one of the earliest examples of an author likening verbal creation to the creation of the cosmos. The great writer feels a spiritual affinity with the Divine Being, not only because he is also a creator of unique and genuine beauty, but also because he has freed himself from the confinements of ordinary human life, and in this sense has become "godlike." This statement of Zhuangzi already shows a keen insight into the work of "creative consciousness." The idea that the Chinese world is an "uncreated" one is thus misleading if it implies that by not inventing significant creation myths, or by not allowing any such myths to flourish in the culture, the ancient Chinese committed themselves to the assumption of an "uncreated" universe. On the contrary, the typically noncom- mittal ancient Chinese cosmological speculation left open the pos- sibility of cosmic creation. Critics who perceive a stark unaware- ness of the possibility of cosmic creation in early Chinese culture and attribute it to a peculiar kind of imaginative poverty seem strangely oblivious of the social upheaval and cultural transition occurring in the Spring and Autumn (722-481 BC) and Warring SAll translations from Chinese texts are mine, unless otherwise indicated.</page><page sequence="8">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/105 States (403-221 BC) periods, which drastically changed the intel- lectual landscape in China. It is revealing that when The Analects records that Confucius does not speak about a number of things, it makes clear that the lacunae are significant silences: "The topics the Master did not speak of were prodigies, [supernatural] forces, abnormality, and gods" (Chap.7, 1:146). The fact that Confucius could take a conspicuous ideological stance by not jumping into these waters indicates a degree of public preoccupation with such issues during his lifetime. When discussing possible reasons for the demise of Moism in Chinese culture, Burton Watson observes that the Moist adherence to traditional religious values and its at- tempt "to drag men back to the simple, pietistic, and fear-ridden faith of antiquity" (9) no longer suited the changing intellectual climate of the time, whereas both Confucianism and Daoism rec- ognized and even encouraged the trends towards skepticism and agnosticism: "a growing atmosphere of sophistication and ratio- nalism led men to reject or radically reinterpret the ancient leg- ends and religious beliefs that Mo Tzu [Mozi] had so fervently af- firmed" (13). Zhuangzi's Great Smith fable vividly exemplifies this new trend; in it he argues that it is inappropriate and unnatural for humans to speculate on, or to attempt to interfere with, the Creator's master plan: "Suppose the Great Smith is forging metals, and a metal jumps up and declares: 'I will have to be made into a moxia (a legendary sword of finest quality)!' The Great Smith would no doubt take it as an ominous metal" (Chap.6, 3:119). To attribute the relative lack of interest in explicit cosmogony in the aftermath of this cultural transition to some kind of naivete, per- ceptive deficiency, or hardheaded empiricism reflects only the critics' own inability to grasp the skeptical approach. The effect of the skeptical approach is evident even in some of the more "reliable" pre-Han sources of Chinese mythology. In his Tian wen, or Asking Heaven, Qu Yuan (ca 340-277 BC) offers cosmo- logical questions rather than answers. The possibility of an omni- scient presence or point of view seems to preoccupy the author at the beginning of Asking Heaven, where he suggests that our knowl- edge of this universe seems inevitably limited and inaccurate be- cause we are confined within it. For instance, how can anyone come to the knowledge that Heaven has nine layers without ever being able to look at it from an outside perspective? As Qu Yuan asks: "[It is said that] Heaven has nine layers; but who has man- aged to measure it?" This question then leads to a larger one: "What a great accomplishment was it [to build such a system]? Who began the construction?" (3/26). By raising these questions Qu Yuan demands a rational and empirical basis for the mytho- logical construct of cosmogony. The concept of creation from out- side seems to have inherent logical problems. As Qu Yuan ob-</page><page sequence="9">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/106 serves, if Nilwo, the goddess who creates the human race, also needs a body to perform her creative work, "Who designed and made her body?" (3/26). This speculative mode of thinking characterizes the typical Chi- nese conception of the creator-as a possibility or a metaphor rather than a belief. The speaker in The First Prosepoem on the Red Cliffby the Song Dynasty author Su Shi (1037-1101) refers to beau- tiful landscapes as secret gems owned by the Creator of Things. Since the realization of their value depends on the perception of refined human minds, mortals may also become part of the cosmic order through aesthetic interaction with nature: Only the fresh breezes over the river and the bright moon between the hills: these become music in the ear and color in the eye, with no law that denies our access to them and no limit of their resources. They are the endless treasures of the Creator of Things, which you and I enjoy together. (3-4) In one of his famous pieces of landscape description, Liu Zongyuan (773-819) depicts the skeptical Chinese mind contem- plating the problem of cosmic creation: I have been pondering over the question of whether there is a cosmic Creator or not for quite long. At this point [of seeing such a beautiful landscape], I become further convinced that the Creator does exist. I then wonder why the Creator has not placed such a beauty in the central area but locates it instead in this remote territory of the barbarians. This is like someone who has a marvelous skill but is able to show it only once in several hundred or thousand years, with so much work and so little profit. If the assumed Divine Being can do things as inappropriate as this, could it be then that the Creator actually does not exist? (2:476) The author is thus caught in a dilemma: although the astonishing beauty of the natural world suggests a spiritual essence, the world of human affairs is too disordered (as evident in his own exile) to sustain any belief in ultimate reason and justice. In this light we may understand the widespread popular version of the Chinese creation figure Pangu, who separates Heaven and Earth through a creative but unself-conscious hacking with an ax. The story's appeal to a Chinese audience seems to lie in its obvious fictionality, or, in other words, its conspicuous lack of seriousness (as implied, for instance, by the obviously problematic "ax") nec- essary for a grand creation myth. Unlike the steady and orderly manner of the creative labor detailed in Genesis, Pangu's action springs from an impulse and may be described as a "spontaneous" event requiring no master plan or premeditation. In other words, the Pangu story embodies a cosmological unconscious that seeks to reconcile the opposition between creation and self-generation. But is it really necessary to assume that a general notion of cre- ation can be derived only from cosmogony? To insist on this is to deny that all creation theories are, after all, human products. When watching small children engrossed in making figures with clay, we may wonder whether some inherent affinity with the Cre-</page><page sequence="10">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/107 ator prompts them to imitate Him in such an utterly unself-con- scious way. Or is it rather that children's play provided the crucial prototype for the great creation myth? Siu-kit Wong argues that "it is essential to conceive the universe as being created before we can think of human activities as imitations of the primary act" (Notes on Poetry xiv). It may be so, however, only if the primary model as- sumes a larger-than-life authority. As Plaks points out, in Chinese culture, "The reason that myth is not rearranged into an orga- nized system in its own right is due primarily to the fact that it is treated as an integral part of human knowledge rather than a sub- division roped off by the attribution of divinity" (17). In the West, "deconstructive" reading of the Bible becomes a prominent fea- ture of Renaissance culture, playing also a strategic role in the Ro- mantic endeavor to "rescue" the Christian faith. In such an intel- lectual atmosphere, it is not surprising that the poet/critic would propose a humanistic or "aesthetic" origin of the creation myth, as William Blake does so poignantly in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell": Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales. And at length they pronounced that the gods had ordered such things. Thus man forgot that all deities reside in the human breast. (Plate 11, 37) It is thus man's poetic impulse that gives rise to the imagination of cosmic creation, rather than the opposite; the "other" is part of the self. Northrop Frye observes that the mortal condition of hu- man life predetermines the archetypal pattern of cosmogonic con- templation: "We derive our notions of beginnings and ends from our own births and deaths, the two crucial events in which we first join a moving belt of phenomena and finally drop off it. The mov- ing belt itself cannot be thought of as beginning or ending, but, because we begin and end, we insist that beginning and ending must be somehow much more important than merely continuing" (34). In other words, creation myths arise from a painful internal condition of self-consciousness, rather than from simply a desire for "mimetic pleasure" or theatrical stimulation. While the idea that the creative impulse originates from human instinct or natural order is a prevailing concept in traditional Chi- nese criticism, it is also not uncommon in the West. Aristotle ob- serves that "the creation of poetry generally is due to two causes, both rooted in human nature [the instinct for imitation and a feel- ing for music and rhythm] " (Poetics, Dorsh 35). Longinus also de- clares: "Nature is the first cause and the fundamental creative principle in all activities" (On the Sublime, Dorsh 101). The widespread concept of the dichotomy between nature and art in Western criticism since the Renaissance also emphasizes the spontaneous and unconscious engendering and growth of the poetic genius. By contrast, the depiction of the author as a small</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/108 counterpart of the Christian God appears only on rare occasions, as a bold but somewhat forced metaphor. When Philip Sidney de- scribes the poet as a small "maker" made by the "Heavenly Maker" in his high rhetoric regarding the truth value of poetry, he is quick to add that "these arguments will by few be understood, and by fewer granted" (158). Sidney acknowledges this because he under- stands that the Christian myth of an Artificer God, who starts ev- erything off and makes all things more or less their present form, is in general not very encouraging to the human artist. In fact, in Sidney we can already see some of the prominent features of the Western concept of the poet as an individual creator, a viewpoint that shows much greater affinity with the humanistic tradition than with Christian orthodoxy. Northrop Frye offers perhaps the most insightful study of this apparently paradoxical relationship between divine and human creations in his Creation &amp; Recreation, contending that "the humanly creative is whatever profoundly dis- turbs our sense of 'the' creation, a reversing or neutralizing of it," and is in this way an act of "decreation." In Frye's idiom, "The en- counter of God and man in creation seems to be rather like what some of the great poets of nuclear physics have described as the encounter of matter with anti-matter: each annihilates the other" (11). Given this kind of antithetical relationship, studies of literary creativity in Western culture must depend almost entirely on secu- lar literature. Typically, the Western creative artist who belongs to this tradition sees himself not as a miniature deity, but rather a "sinner," as Oscar Wilde describes it in "The Critic as Artist": "Af- ter playing Chopin, I feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed..." (Frye 11). This "sinner" not only often looks skeptically or disapprovingly at the Master Plan, but also shows a tendency to move away altogether from the Christian pre- occupation with cosmogony. He may torment himself because of his unbelief or continue to use the Judeo-Christian mythological narrative structure as a potent poetic model. But his way of think- ing departs from the Judeo-Christian tradition (is essentially un- Christian) in that he no longer attempts to reenact an ancient mythological tale, set before the beginning of time, as an adequate account of his present and personal experience. II There is, however, some truth in Plak's, Owen's, and Yu's obser- vations about the difference between Western and Chinese poetic traditions at the conceptual level. While the mythological narra- tive model has remained a potent element in the Western poetic tradition, the similar structure in the Chinese tradition (as exemplified, for instance, in the Chuci poetry) has been largely suppressed and silenced since Han times. The narrative mode of Chinese poetry thus tends to be realistic, autobiographical, or</page><page sequence="12">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/109 "non-fictional," lacking the kind of allegorical allusiveness that has become to a certain extent conventional in Western poetry. This difference is pushed too far, however, when critics postu- late radically different hermeneutic strategies for reading Western and Chinese poetry. For instance, Owen cites Wordsworth's "Com- posed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802" as a telling example of Western hermeneutic assumptions. While the title of the poem indicates a specific historical setting, Owen contends that the Western reader is trained to read it as nothing more than a convenient excuse for doing "something else": "It matters not at all whether Wordsworth ever actually stood on Westminster Bridge on September 3, 1802, and gazed at the city of London. It is just a fiction... The reader is taught to ignore Wordsworth's pre- cise instruction..." (14-15). But when the Chinese poet Du Fu writes about his experience of traveling at night on a river, Owen insists that it does matter to the Chinese poet as well as to his reader that he confronts an actual physical scene, since this is a necessary condition for evolving a poetic sentiment. Owen de- scribes the poem as "a special kind of diary entry": "The greatness of the poem emerges not through poetic invention but through the happy chance of this poet meeting this moment and this scene" (12-13), even though the poem reveals no attempt to specify the date and locality of the event. Thus, fictionality be- comes a reader-inscribed value. The Western reader, according to Owen, is so prone to read all poetry as fiction or allegory that he or she would do so in spite of the author's conscious effort to prevent such a reading. The reader of Du Fu, on the other hand, even when confronting much more vaguely delineated poetic imagery, would nonetheless believe that "the poem is not a fiction: it is a unique, factual account of an experience in historical time, a hu- man consciousness encountering, interpreting, and responding to the world" (15). To understand this issue better, it would be helpful to look more closely at the referential structures of the above-mentioned poems by Wordsworth and Du Fu. Wordsworth begins the poem by inviting the reader to share with him a "sight"-his view of London from Westminster Bridge in early morning, when the "Ships, tow- ers, domes, theatres, and temples" are covered by the calm beauty of the morning, "like a garment," and are "glittering in the smoke- less air." Then comes the first sunlight, "beautifully steep[ing]" the surrounding valley, rocks, hills, and river. "Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!" the poet exclaims, while his eyes remain fixed on the physical object: "The river glideth at his own sweet will..." The poem ends by anticipating the city's imminent awaken- ing, building a dramatic tension without apparent change in the narrative perspective: "Dear God! the very houses seem asleep; /</page><page sequence="13">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/110 And all that mighty heart is lying still!" (170). Subtly the poet in- vites his reader to take a moment away from the routine, noisy, and increasingly fragmented city life, and join him in a poetic journey of appreciating natural beauty and reflecting on the one- ness of things. In this way, the setting of the poem becomes the crucial poetic device, accountable for its thematic import and lyri- cal effect. If the Western reader of this poem might not be interested in the details of Wordworth's life that are related to its composition, it would be a mistake to assume that he or she would also overlook the author's painstaking effort to establish a realistic, nonfictional setting for the poem, with a specific historical time and locus, and a first-person eyewitness testimony. In other words, such a reader would not fail to read an intention behind Wordsworth's tech- nique of concretization, which is precisely to work against the reader's "trained" habit of leaving the physical world behind. "I have wished to keep the Reader in the company of flesh and blood," Wordsworth claims ("Preface to the Seconde Edition of Lyrical Ballads" 450). By fostering a new poetic sensibility that per- ceives poetry as the fusion of ideas with matter rather than as alle- gorical abstraction, Wordsworth is able to announce, more than anyone else in English literature, a radical departure from neo- classicist iconicity. Du Fu's poem "Writes of What He Feels, Traveling by Night," on the other hand, is often seen as a tour de force of poetic diction and imagination. While the reader may assume the "great river" to be the Changjiang River, the poet makes no effort to relate any specific natural scenery or any detail of his personal life except his old age: Slender grasses, breeze faint on the shore, Here the looming mast, the lone night boat. (Owen's translation) The poem begins with an almost archetypal image of a lonely trav- eler whose fragile existence is contrasted with the vast presence of physical nature-a poetic scheme that Du Fu uses frequently in his late period. Stars hang down on the breadth of the plain, The moon gushes in the great river's current. This magnificent second couplet, which dramatizes the immensity of the open land and the momentum of the river, is often seen as a conscious attempt to rival Li Bai's famous lines in his "Farewell Beyond the Thorn-Gate Gorge," which also depicts the great Changjiang River gushing through the gorges: Mountains merge into the plain, While the River pours into the vast open land. ("DuJingmen songbie," Quan Tang shi. Vol. 174.)</page><page sequence="14">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/111 In addition to their referential and stylistic similarities, the two couplets share exactly the same metrical and syntactical patterns. In fact, five out of the ten characters in Li Bai's lines also appear in Du Fu's couplet. It is entirely possible that Du Fu's couplet was a response to a textual presence rather than a physical scene. In the third couplet, the poet shifts to an abstract discursive mode when lamenting that his accomplishments in poetry might not secure him posthumous fame, while his activities in this life will soon come to an end due to his age and poor health: My name shall not be known for my writing; Sick, growing old, I must yield up my post. The poem then enters into an allegorical mode of expression in the last couplet, when the speaker paints a poetic image of himself that has cosmic scope: Wind-tossed and fluttering-what is my likeness? A single gull of the sands, between Heaven and Earth. (Owen's translation, 25.) Instead of focusing on the physical objects in front of his eyes - the slender grass, the gentle breeze, the river, and the darkness of the night-the speaker enters into the timeless and boundless world of his imagination, where the image of the floating gull, set against the backdrop of "Heaven and Earth," becomes diminished and enlarged at the same time. In explaining this couplet, Owen contends that "Metaphor (or simile) is not essential to a poetry that writes what the poet sees, thinks, and feels." Metaphor is "no more than an action of the mind among others"; it shows "the pos- sibility of essential likeness in things." According to Owen's inter- pretation, Du Fu did not merely use the image of the bird as a poetic metaphor, but actually found the imaginary bird to be his "true kin," or his "parallel identity" (26-27). In other words, when Du Fu says he is like a gull, he means it literally. Goethe once described two kinds of spectators of theater. The first kind, the "uncultivated" spectator, perceives a theatrical piece as nothing more than a representation of a natural event and has no insight into the author's intention: "he treats a work of art as he would any object he meets with in the market" (57). By contrast, the second kind of spectator sees the apparent truthfulness of the- atrical representation as merely a "deception." This spectator rec- ognizes that "the truth of nature and truth of art are two distinct things" and that "a perfect work of art is a work of the human soul," which, in its harmony, density, and subtlety, "is above na- ture." This spectator has the sophistication to be able to appreci- ate a work of art as having something far greater than representa- tional value: "the excellence of selection, the refinement of the composition, the superiority of the little world of art..." (57). With this comparison in mind, we can now understand that</page><page sequence="15">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/112 when Owen states that "we" develop an interest in poetry not as a recording of actual events but as "something else," he is referring only to sophisticated readers in the West. His delineation of the Chinese mode of reading as viewing "transparencies," on the other hand, resembles the mental process of the naive or "unculti- vated" reader in Goethe's description. To be precise, the crucial question Owen raises is whether a sophisticated reader in the Chi- nese literary tradition is capable of differentiating between nature and art, reality and representation. It is important to note that Owen and later on Chi Xiao both attempt to depict the functioning of the Chinese critical mind by referring to Liu Xie's Wenxin diaolong, which many consider the most important work of literary criticism in ancient China. From Liu Xie's concept of the "triad" of Heaven, Earth, and the Mind in the opening chapter "Yuan Dao" or "The Origin," Owen concludes that Liu Xie perceives the wen (pattern) of the mind and the wen of physical nature as being engendered and governed by the same process of cosmic manifestation. As Liu Xie reasons: Everything, animal and vegetable, possesses aesthetic patterning. Dragon and phoenix show auspicious events in the brilliance of their design; the tiger, by its brightness, the leopard by the tended lushness of his spots... If such things, un- aware, possess the radiance of many colors swelling within, how can this human vessel of mind lack its own aesthetic pattern? (1)2 In this context, Owen argues, writing is considered to be not a "re- presentation" of the world but part of the world's own coming- into-being (18-20). Owen then shifts his attention to another chapter of Liu Xie's work, "Wu se," or "Nature," where he finds "a theory of sympathetic resonance": "The mind of the poet is 'rolled round and round with the course of things': he is both in the physical world and at the same time aware of being caught up in it" (21-23). However, instead of seeing Liu Xie's position in light of Wordsworth's scheme of "man and nature adapted to each other" ("Preface to Lyrical Ballads" 455), or Shelley's "unremitting inter- change" between the mind and "things around" ("Mont Blanc" 90), Owen depicts Liu Xie's poet as a "passive scientist of the natu- ral order through whom... [the physical world's] empirical prin- ciples are made manifest" (23). In short, according to Owen's in- terpretation, Liu Xie confuses the wen of nature with the wen as literature, and considers literary composition a direct and empiri- cal response to physical and external reality. In an even more extreme reading, in his essay "Lyric Archi-Oc- casion: Coexistence of 'Now' and Then," Chi Xiao finds the tradi- tional Chinese critic incapable of making three basic distinctions: 2 My translation of passages from Liu Xie's Wenxin diaolong is largely based on Vincent Yu-chung Shih's translation, The Literary Mind and the Carving of Drag- ons.</page><page sequence="16">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/113 "First, Chinese critics usually did not admit that there was a di- chotomy between wild nature and human nature." Second, "Since ancient China lacked a tradition of individualism,... the distinc- tion between an individual subjectivity and social intersubjectivity was also ignored." Third, since "all men... share an identical spirit with each other," the difference between the past and the present also becomes "indistinguishable" (24-26). Xiao also cites Liu Xie as a quintessential example of the per- ceptive lacunae, or "inattention'"(25), of the Chinese critical mind, quoting basically the same passages that Owen does in his book. Xiao states that in the opening passage of the "Yuan Dao" chapter of Liu Xie's Wenxin diaolong, "the wen of Heaven and the wen of Man are treated as synonymous terms." "On the one hand," he further explains, "natural phenomena such as the moon, sun and clouds are regarded as something of similar magnitude to the cultural patterns of man; on the other, human cultural creations such as language are seen as 'inherent' as the law of nature" (24). Following Owen's lead, Xiao also insists that a poet must have con- tact with the physical world to generate poetic emotions and con- ceptions: "a poet was not simply an 'observer' but an encounterer of these occasions whereon his emotions were engendered." While admitting the "social productiveness of literary convention," Xiao maintains that these conventions only motivate the poet "to seek out or to wait for archetypal occasions in reality" (28-29). The problem with these readings of Liu Xie is that they may be described as a form of literalism. When Liu Xie makes an elabo- rately polemic move-to the extent of inventing a peculiar kind of private cosmology-to promote the notion of a unifying principle underlying the wen of nature and the wen of the mind, it is clear that to him the distinction between the two wen's is far more self- evident than their affinity. In other words, by fashioning these po- lar concepts, Liu Xie has made the categorical distinction, or di- chotomy, between natural phenomena and human culture quite explicit. When Liu Xie asks his reader to "reason out" that if physi- cal nature has elaborate patterns, how much more so should the human mind, with its intelligence and sensitivity, have patterns of its own, he implies a hierarchical order and a notion of cosmic determinism reminiscent of a long tradition in Western poetics that sees poetic genius as the finest product of nature. This tradi- tion can be traced back to Longinus or Plotinus, but finds its most elaborate expression in the Romantic idealization of nature. Schelling's concept of man's creativity as analogous to the uncon- scious creativity of nature is perhaps the most influential: "...the beauty of the soul in itself, joined to sensuous grace, is the highest apotheosis of nature... The spirit of nature is only in appearance opposed to the soul; essentially, it is the instrument of its revela-</page><page sequence="17">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/114 tion" (463). Equally well-known is Goethe's summary of the idea: "A perfect work of art is a work of the human soul, and in this sense, also a work of nature...it is above nature, yet not unnatural" (57). The inadequacy of Owen's and Xiao's treatments of Liu Xie's view of literary composition also stems from their narrow range of selections from Wenxin diaolong, which has the effect of reducing Liu Xie's massive structure of literary theory to a rela- tively one-dimensional system. If Liu Xie has in some places de- scribed the engendering of literature (wen) as a natural process, it is equally obvious, once we consider Wenxin diaolongin its entirety, that he also sees literary composition as an act of individual will and imagination, as well as an exercise of literary forms and con- ventions. In the chapter "Shen si," or "Imagination," which contains his most concentrated argument on literary conceptualization, Liu Xie depicts the creation of a literary work as the result of an in- tense inner exertion and concentration in an attempt to generate a poetic scheme or imagery "out of nothing," so to speak: One who is engaged in creative thinking travels far in spirit. Quietly absorbed in contemplation, his thinking reaches back one thousand years; with only the slight- est movement of his countenance, his vision penetrates ten thousand leagues. He fashions the music of pearls and jade between his lips, and envisages the rolling of winds and clouds in front of his brows and lashes. (493) To enter this mood of imagination, the poet must shut himself off from the outside world and focus on his inner experience and aes- thetic pursuits. This process involves not simply reliving some ste- reotypical "archi-occasions," or begetting some awareness of one's momentary feelings, but consciously going beyond instinctive re- actions to the outside world, and entering a state of "magical thinking": When spiritual thinking is in operation, all possible vistas open up before it. Rules and principles become mere formalities, and there is not the least trace of carving and engraving. When [the poet] ascends mountains [in his imagination], the mountains are wholly tinged with the coloring of his emotion; when his eyes rove over the sea [in such a mood], the sea is saturated with sentiments. (494) Following Cao Pi's concept of literature as the textual embodi- ment of personality, Liu Xie also develops a full-fledged theory of the creative faculty. In his chapters on "Ti xing" ("Styles and Per- sonality"), "Cai lue" ("Individual Talents"), and "Zhi yin" ("The Understanding Critic")," Liu Xie defines individual distinction and originality as the highest values in literature and considers the discerning of these qualities the primary task of criticism. In the 3 For a detailed study of this last chapter, see my article "A View of the Develop- ment of the Ancient Chinese Philosophy of Language from the Perspective of Liu Xie's The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" in Journal of the Chinese Lan- guage Teachers Association, vol. 31, no. 1 (1996):29-40.</page><page sequence="18">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/115 "technical" chapters of Wenxin diaolong, Liu Xie investigates a full range of formal and technical issues involved in literary composi- tion, encompassing areas such as "Structuring," "Paragraphing and Sentencing," "Diction," "Metrical Patterns," "Parallelism," "Metaphor and Allegory," "Hyperbole," and "Literary Allusion." In short, to Liu Xie a poem is something far greater than its referen- tial value. Since Chinese poetry typically functions in a nonfiction mode, one may wonder to what extent the traditional Chinese reader would take its narrative element at face value. Admittedly, a de- gree of sophistication and considerable reading experience on the reader's part are required to realize that a literary text does not always offer reliable clues for tracing its elements back to the author's life experience or the historical event it refers to. The author's concern with the aesthetic and, sometimes, sociopolitical impact of his work often outweighs his desire for historical authen- ticity-if he has such a desire at all. The poet may see his role as nothing more than that of "making believe" as a lyric voice, feeling no obligation to witness or live through the events depicted in his work. In this regard, Qian Zhongshu's discussion of the theme of "sorrow" in Chinese poetry may shed some interesting light on this "open secret" of the author's. Qian points out that the poet who writes "poetry of suffering" may be tempted to find "an easy way out": "...we do not get many opportunities to be 'ecstatic or bro- ken-hearted,' not to mention that it must be pretty uncomfortable to be in either of those states!" (34). As an example, Qian refers to a certain Li Tingyan [Li T'ing-yen] who submitted to his superior a poem with a line indicating that his two brothers had both died. When the superior, alarmed by such family calamities, offered him his heartfelt sympathy, Li calmly replied that he was only making it up to fashion a neat couplet. In estimating how likely a reader might be to be taken in by this kind of deceit, Qian points out that in the Chinese cultural environment, "the ordinary layman, accus- tomed to this sort of convention, would definitely see through what this Mr. Li was up to" (38). In other words, to most tradition- ally educated Chinese readers, who tend to have some experience composing poetry themselves, it is a matter of indifference whether Li Tingyan's brothers actually died or not. In fact, since authors are often not willing to confess their "lies," it has become an amusing sport for critics and commentators to catch them not telling the truth. For instance, Zhou Zizhi observes that in his 'Journey to the North," Du Fu, seemingly in an attempt to show that he could be facetious about his own poverty, paints a funny picture of his children's ragged clothes patched up with old garments decorated with images of auspicious animals. In another poem, however, Du Fu urges a painter to draw a pine tree on "a</page><page sequence="19">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/116 bolt of fine silk I have." Jokingly, Zhou comments that if extra silk is available, why not use it for clothing instead of painting. "Were Du Fu alive today," Zhou adds, "he would also burst into laughter upon hearing my comments" (357). Similarly, Ge Lifang expresses doubt about Ouyang Xiu's account of once being entertained by a singing girl with bare feet and a loud instrument with a cracked sound, pointing out that at that time, Ouyang Xiu was already prime minister in court: while the poet's modesty is commend- able, "his words about 'bare feet' and so forth are definitely not true" (606). While most critics tend to treat such "loose morals" with a sense of humor, to some the wide-spread and unabashed practice of "pretending" proves rather vexing. He Wenhuan, for instance, warns that it is a sign of ill fortune when a poet "is young and healthy but speaks of sickness and decline, eats well and stays warm and yet talks about poverty and hardship, and lives in peace and security while entertaining a melancholy mood" (He 824). This threat of heavenly punishment reveals a degree of frustration on the part of the critic in coping with a literary convention that seems overused and out of control. If the Chinese reader, like the Western reader, is not seriously concerned about the empirical truth of poetry, we may ask whether there is any ground for the assertion that there is a neces- sary connection between fictionality and creativity. While the mythological or allegorical narrative model may be seen as a trade- mark of Western poetry, using this model does not guarantee any genuine creative achievement. On the other hand, we would have no trouble finding poems in the Western tradition that impress us as "creative" or original even though they do not use this model. Since the Romantic age, a salient tendency in the Western poetic tradition has been to reject the allegorical model as a cliche. In his "Preface to the Lyrical Ballads," Wordsworth warns his readers that they "will find that personifications of abstract ideas rarely occur in these volumes; and are utterly rejected, as an ordinary device to elevate the style" (449). At the technical level, Wordsworth claims that he endeavors to "keep the Reader in the company of flesh and blood" by "at all times" looking steadily at his object, in the hope that the reader will find "little falsehood of description," or obvi- ous fictionality, in his work (450). Keats, by contrast, sees life itself as a "continual allegory" and finds personified "he[a] then mythol- ogy abstractions" obstructive to an apprehension of man's inner divinity ("Letter to George and Georgiana Keats, Feb.14-May 3, 1819," 305, 337). Some poets find the mythological/allegorical narrative mode entirely inappropriate for expressing their poetic visions. Whitman, for instance, finds "a nuisance and revolt" in the kind of poetry "which distorts honest shapes or which creates un- earthly beings or places or contingencies..." ("1855 Preface to</page><page sequence="20">COSMOGONY &amp; POETIC CREATIVITY/117 Leaves of Grass" 722). The problem of identifying poetic creativity with a certain narra- tive structure is that it implies the notion of creativity as a con- scious arrangement and manipulation involving a conformist ef- fort to reenact or reiterate a familiar model, whereas the creative quality in poetry tends to be much less tangible, as an aesthetic distinction that is individually recognized and often defies analysis and categorization. It is probably not too far-fetched to assume that traditional Chinese poetry is also capable of achieving this kind of distinction, even though its cultural substances and formal conventions might differ considerably from those in the Western tradition. When we describe a certain poet as "creative," what we mean is not merely that he or she writes something in verse or produces a fiction, but rather that the poet has written something that mat- ters and has attained some individual distinction. The question of creativity is thus central in any poetic tradition, as it points to the very "secret" of poetic effectiveness and literary immortality. Per- haps the most disturbing effect of the critical preoccupation with a "Chinese difference" is that it has the potential to prevent cross- cultural comparative research from taking place at the level of mu- tual illumination. The purpose of this study is to show that it is precisely by paying serious attention to Chinese thought on poetic creativity and related issues, rather than assuming its nonexist- ence, that we stand the best chance of arriving at a truly meaning- ful dialogue between the Eastern and Western poetic traditions.
