<plain_text><page sequence="1">Towards Co-ordination in Great Britain: A Survey By W. O. LESTER SMITH ADMINISTRATIVE chaos" was a phrase much used by reformers at the close of the nineteenth century to describe the educational landscape. Ir- respective of their political sympathies, they recognized that constitutional re- construction, both at the center and locally, was a prerequisite of advance. This reconstruction was accomplished by two Acts of Parliament, the Board of Education Act (1899) and the Edu- cation Act (1902); the former dealt with administration at the center, the latter provided the system of local ad- ministration that, with minor modifica- tions, operates today. The Board of Education Act estab- lished one central department for edu- cation in England and Wales, with functions and responsibilities previously discharged by three separate bodies. The Education Act abolished the 2,568 School Boards, and also the 788 School Attendance Committees which had func- tioned where there was no School Board, and it made the 62 County Councils and 69 County Borough Councils the local education authorities. Both acts contained concessions and compromises which tended to make the new organization less orderly than it would have been without them. Many had hoped for a Ministry of Education and a Minister, but instead Parliament created a Board of Education. The ef- fect, however, was much the same, for the Board, which was composed of the chief officers of state, never met through- out the forty-five years of its life. But the fiction of an active board was al- ways retained in spite of the fact that presidents functioned without its advice. "Successive Presidents delighted to de- scribe themselves as 'transient heads of a phantom Board,' and officials exer- cised their ingenuity in attributing to the Board anthropomorphic qualities. Thus the Board was 'pleased' or 'sur- prised'; it learned with 'satisfaction' or 'concern'; it is even alleged to have been 'unable to retain its composure' at some flagrant irregularity."' No explanation of the government's preference for a "Board" was forthcom- ing at the time the act was passed; when asked later to account for it, the Duke of Devonshire, who steered the bill in the House of Lords, said that he had forgotten the why and where- fore. But it is reasonable to assume that in the laissez-faire mood of that time it was deemed better to have a board available to check any transient president with a tendency to interfere and intervene. And certainly that is the explanation of the provision in the act limiting the function of the Board to one of "superintendence" of matters relating to education in England and Wales. But this definition of its func- tions did not prevent the Board from usually getting local authorities to do what it wanted or from achieving some degree of co-ordination throughout the country. CENTRAL DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES The development of the relationship between the Board and local authori- ties makes an interesting story, in 1 Education, 1900-1950, Report of Ministry of Education for 1950 (London: His Maj- esty's Stationery Office, 1951), p. 2. 74</page><page sequence="2">TOWARDS CO-ORDINATION IN GREAT BRITAIN: A SURVEY 75 which personal factors counted for much. There were two principal phases. The first can be attributed almost entirely to the first Permanent Secretary after the passing of the 1902 act, Sir Robert Morant, a co-ordinator by nature with a liking for power and a desire to domi- nate. A great administrator of the forceful kind, he stretched the limited authority of the Board to the utmost, and was largely responsible for the na- tionwide drive to provide new grammar schools which followed the passing of the Education Act of 1902. A re- cent Permanent Secretary, Sir Maurice Holmes, has described his methods: His attitude towards the newly constituted Local Education Authorities was far re- moved indeed from the spirit of friendly cooperation which characterises the present relationship between the Ministry and Lo- cal Authorities. He knew what he wanted done, and by a curious mixture of brow- beating and persuasiveness he usually suc- ceeded in getting it done.2 The second phase, which began when Morant left the Board of Education in 1911, has been described as a "progres- sive partnership between the Central Department, the local education au- thorities, and the teachers." - It has had its ups and downs, but it has grown into a relationship of genuine friendli- ness, the outstanding characteristic of the educational service in this country. These good relations have, more than any other factor, been the mainspring of co-ordination, making it a natural process based on good sense rather than on schemes and procedure. Reference will be made later in this article to the-unevenness of the achievement, but considering the Board's limited pow- ers, the degree of co-ordination accom- plished has been remarkable. CHECKS TO CO-ORDINATION There were, however, three features of the Education Act of 1902 which checked the progress of co-operation and co-ordination. Of these, one was an unfortunate compromise designed to allay the fierce opposition to the aboli- tion of the School Boards. This oppo- sition was strong in urban areas that were not county boroughs; their repre- sentatives objected vehemently to the proposal that their schools should be administered by the County Councils. So Parliament agreed that certain areas within the County Council area should be allowed to administer elementary education only; the areas accorded this concession were noncounty boroughs with a population of over 10,000 in 1901, and urban districts with a popu- lation of over 20,000 in 1901. Two consequences of this compromise were regrettable. In the first place, it was a mistake to make the census of one specified year the determinant of the concession. The second consequence was more serious; the existence of these separate authorities for elementary edu- cation blocked the road of advance to- wards a reorganization of education into primary and secondary stages and to- wards the goal of secondary education for all. It was not until Mr. Butler had the courage in 1944 to end this anomaly that the road to universal secondary education was opened. Another aspect of the Education Act of 1902 which made a co-ordinated ad- vance difficult was the permissive char- acter of the clauses dealing with educa- tion other than elementary. Just as the laissez-faire temper of that day had led Parliament to limit the role of the central department to one of "superin- tendence," so it caused the legislature to leave the local authorities largely free to decide what provision they would make for secondary and technical edu- 2 The First Fifty Years (University of Lon- don Press, 1947), p. 120. a Education, 1900-1950, p. 1.</page><page sequence="3">76 THE ANNALS OF TUE AMERICAN ACADEMY cation. Such freedom encouraged pro- gressive authorities to exercise initia- tive, undertake developments on a wide scale, and pioneer in particular direc- tions. But it also led to wide discrep- ancies between one area and another, and children born in the territory of an authority making good use of its per- missive powers had much better op- portunities than had, those born in areas that could with some justice be de- scribed as backward. The third feature of the Education Act of 1902 that made co-ordination difficult was connected with the dual system. When the foundation of our national system were laid by the Edu- cation Act of 1870 it was agreed that there should be both school board schools and voluntary schools within the national system. Before 1902 the voluntary schools, mostly Church of England or Roman Catholic, received government maintenance grants and in the early days building grants. The 1902 act not only confirmed the dual system but fortified it by providing that the voluntary schools, like the council schools (as the board schools were now called), should be wholly maintained by local rates and national taxes, leaving the churches responsible only for ex- penditures on structure. This conces- sion roused the bitter opposition of the Nonconformists, but it was soon found that this additional financial aid still left the churches unable to provide ac- commodation of a standard comparable to that in the council schools. Further- more, the Hadow Report of 1926, which urged the division of elementary educa- tion into senior and primary stages, led to demands which the churches, unable to afford the cost of building and recon- ditioning schools, were unable to satisfy. Local authorities, when contemplating a co-ordinated educational advance, were always faced, with the prospect that the managers of voluntary schools, even if willing to co-operate, might find them- selves prohibited from doing so because they were unable to shoulder the capital expenditure involved. This greatly lim- ited the programs for reorganization, especially in the rural areas where most of the voluntary schools were. FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS A major weakness of early adminis- tration was the absence of a coherent system of. finance. The state made grants to the School Boards and, after 1902, to the new local authorities, and the first grants to voluntary societies were made as far back as 1833. The School Boards and, later, the local au- thorities levied local rates. But not until 1918 was an attempt made to es- tablish an organic financial relationship between the central government and the local authorities. The Education Act of that year, for which H. A. L. Fisher was responsible, effected a complete reform of the system of grants to local authori- ties. For the fifty-seven separate grants payable by the Board of Education, there was substituted a system of an- nual substantive grant related to local expenditure and dependent upon the maintenance of an efficient system of education by the local authority. Un- fortunately there had to be two sub- stantive grants, one for elementary and one for education above the elementary level, because of the existence (already referred to) of separate authorities for elementary education. The grant for elementary education was calculated on a formula which took into account the number of children in the area, the ex- penditure on their elementary educa- tion, and the financial capacity of .the area to meet that expenditure as meas- ured by assessable value. The grant for education other than elementary was calculated at a flat rate of 50 per cent of the net local expenditure. Today, except for certain special serv-</page><page sequence="4">TOWARDS CO-ORDINATION IN GREAT BRITAIN: A SURVEY 77 ices such as school meals, the grant pay- able by the Ministry of Education to local authorities for all their educational expenditure (within the province of that Ministry) is based on a formula similar to that adopted in 1918 for elementary education. The principle followed is that of relating the grant-to quote words used by Mr. Butler in 1944- "to the number of children in the area and the capacity of the area to pay for their education." But the point that should be stressed is that the finance of public education .., has grown from a system of particular-and largely unrelated-subsidies to a system of joint finance based upon a real partnership between the central authority and local education authorities. It is, in fact, a story of progress from "contract" to "status" be- tween the two in the pursuit of a common adventure.4 SCOTLAND AND WALES In the gradual approach to a unified and co-ordinated system of education, traditions have been respected and di- versity encouraged. Of this regard for distinctive tradition Scotland is the out- standing example, for although England. and Scotland have shared one Parlia- ment since the Union of 1707, the Scots have fully retained their separate edu- cational system and traditions, the Sec- retary of State for Scotland being re- sponsible for the central administration of Scottish education. Wales, on the other hand, has con- formed to the English administrative pattern, but since 1907 there has been within the Ministry (or, until 1944, the Board) a separate Welsh Department wholly sympathetic to the desire of the Welsh, people to preserve and enrich their national culture and maintain their own language. In the nineteenth cen- tury it was the practice of English ad- ministrators-Matthew Arnold among them-to discourage the use of Welsh in schools, but during the present cen- tury there has been a complete reversal of this policy. The central government in its dealings with English counties and county boroughs has usually lent a sympathetic ear to local points of view, and recent experience suggests that co- ordination and diversity are not incom- patible. EDUCATION ACT OF 1944 While the years before World War II saw the steady growth of an orderly sys- tem, two great obstacles stood in the way of effective co-ordination: one the restriction imposed by statute on the powers of the central authority-the Board of Education could still only "superintend"-and the other the in- ability of the voluntary schools to find money for school construction. The Education Act of 1944 removed both of these roadblocks. There is now a Min- ister with powers of direction and con- trol, and by a substantial readjustment of the dual system voluntary school managers have been enabled and can be required to bring their buildings up to modern standards. The spirit of partnership has survived the shift in the balance of power, but the Ministry is now indisputably the senior partner with a Minister able effectively to exercise a co-ordinating function. He can settle priorities, im- pose minimum requirements, ensure cer- tain standards of staffing, and maintain a level in the scale of grants and awards to students and pupils; can also ensure that provision is made for particular needs, as, for example, the education of handicapped children. All this sounds dictatorial, but after more than ten years' experience of the working of the act one can say without hesitation that no Minister has shown any tendency to 4Education, 1900-1950, p. 32.</page><page sequence="5">78 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY use his immense powers unfairly or to excess. The largest local authority, the London County Council, has like others had its battles with the Minister, espe- cially over secondary school organiza- tion, but as the following comment shows it shares the general view that the Minister has not encroached un- duly: Each local education authority has a real measure of freedom and responsibility. The policies of different authorities vary con- siderably, for example, in the organization of secondary education, and the Ministry has not sought to discourage diversity.5 Especially notable is the fact that co- ordinating policy is never allowed to en- croach on academic freedom. Universi- ties are outside the province of the Min- istry of Education and independent of the local authorities; government grants to universities, amounting to about two- thirds of their expenditure, are admin- istered by a University Grants Commit- tee operating on behalf of the Treasury, and although in the distribution of grants problems of co-ordination con- stantly arise,, the respect for academic freedom is absolute. Grants made to universities by local authorities are un- conditional, but the universities have the wisdom to see that authorities are represented on their courts and coun- cils. A similar attitude prevails in re- gard to the curriculum of schools; this is recognized to be the responsibility of the teachers, and they in turn are care- ful not to abuse the freedom they enjoy in this respect. The Ministry never does more than "suggest," and although Ministry and local authorities determine the types of schools and sometimes argue fiercely in so doing, once the issue of type is settled they are careful to leave teachers free to develop the inner life of each school. CONSULTATIVE MACHINERY Vital to the co-ordinating process is the consultative machinery set up by the Minister. Of this some existed be- fore 1944. Under the Education Act of 1902 a Consultative Committee was es- tablished to advise the President of the Board of Education on questions which he referred to it, and it produced some of the most seminal reports in our edu- cational history, notably the Hadow and Spens Reports. After World War I a committee under the chairmanship of Lord Burnham was constituted to act as a negotiating body to settle teachers' salaries; it is composed of representa- tives of local education authorities and teachers' organizations. A Secondary Schools Examinations Council was also created to co-ordinate the work of approved university examining bodies, which are responsible for the secondary school certificate examinations. With the passing of the Education Act of 1944 the existing consultative machin- ery was strengthened, and some impor- tant additions were made. The former Consultative Committee was replaced by Central Advisory Councils for England and Wales respectively, and they were empowered by the act not only to ad- vise on matters referred to them but also upon "such matters connected with educational theory and practice as they think fit." Scotland has a similar coun- cil, which has issued some valuable re- ports. The Burnham Committee was given statutory status, and the Minister now has legal authority to see that the remuneration paid by local authorities to teachers accords with scales agreed upon by this negotiating body and ac- cepted by him. The Secondary Schools Examinations Council was enlarged to make it more representative of the vari- ous interests concerned. Of the consultative bodies set up since 1944 the most important are two 5 The London Education Service (London County Council, 1954), p. 93.</page><page sequence="6">TOWARDS CO-ORDINATION IN GREAT BRITAIN: A SURVEY 79 National Advisory Councils, one on Education for Industry and Commerce, and the other on the Training and Sup- ply of Teachers. The first, widely representative of industrial, commercial, and teaching interests, serves as apex of a system of regional consultative bodies for further education. The sec- ond keeps under continuous review the supply of and demand for teachers, and studies the problems of teacher educa- tion, acting also as a clearinghouse of opinions that have already found ex- pression in area organizations. There are, too, a few independent co-ordinat- ing bodies aided by the Ministry, which include on their executive councils rep- resentatives of the Ministry, local edu- cation authorities, and teachers. Among these are the National Foundation for Educational Research, the Educational Foundation for Visual Aids, and the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges. The problem of consultation is ren- dered much easier by the existence of well-established associations both of the local authorities and the teachers. The County Councils Association has an Edu- cation Committee, and so has the As- sociation of Municipal Corporations, which speaks for the boroughs; and there is also an important Association of Education Committees which con- cerns itself entirely with the problems that confront local education authori- ties. Education Officers too have their association, which is able to offer expert advice on current problems of educa- tional administration. THE LOCAL AUTHORITY It is important not to give the im- pression that co-ordination is more ac- tively pursued at the national than at the local level. The Education Act re- quires every local authority to appoint a well-qualified Chief Education Offi- cer, and upon his administrative ability and that of his staff the quality of local co-ordination largely depends. One of the most important functions of an edu- cation authority is to maintain close contact with school governors and man- agers, with the many voluntary bodies engaged in adult education, youth serv- ice, and sQcial services affecting edu- cation, and by a system of advisory committees to ensure the interest of in- dustrial and commercial experts in the promotion of technical education. In county areas, to counter the isolation that distance from headquarters may involve, the act requires a system of divisional executive committees. An- other important requirement of the act is that every authority must have a de- tailed development plan or scheme for primary, secondary, and further educa- tion; approved by the Minister, the plan serves as a chart for every stage of advance. School governors know its contents and intelligent local citizens can by studying it acquaint themselves with the authority's intentions over a long term of years. This educational development plan is drawn up to har- monize with housing, road, and other projects as revealed in the city or county plan. CO-ORDINATION WITH OTHER SERVICES Every County and County Borough Council has a wide range of functions, of which education is but one, albeit a very important one and the one which involves the largest expenditure. These councils are, under the Education Act, required to appoint an Education Com- mittee with a majority of aldermen and councillors and a minority of. co-opted persons, selected because of their inter- est in or special knowledge of education. Thus in London, where the Council consists of 150 members, the Education Committee's membership is 50, of whom 12 are co-opted. Although an Educa- tion Committee has considerable dele-</page><page sequence="7">80 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY gated power, it reports regularly to the Council, usually each month. Thus its policy is almost automatically co-ordi- nated with that of the other commit- tees of the Council. Moreover, as one of a hierarchy, the Education Officer is in constant touch with other lead- ing officials-the Clerk of the Council, the Treasurer, the Chief Constable, the Medical Officer of Health, the Surveyor, the Architect, the Librarian, the Parks Superintendent, the Children's Officer, and others. As Dr. Alexander observes, In the education service not only the Chief Education Officer but also other principal officers of the Authority have important contributions to make. It is, for example, usual for the County or County Borough Treasurer to be principal finance officer of the Education Committee, and for the County or County Borough Architect to be architect to the Education Committee.6 At one time in both central and local government there was a tendency for departments to work in isolation; to- day the tendency is the reverse. It has been found, however, that interdepart- mentalism has defects no less serious than those of isolationism. It can cause delay, and lead to procedures and com- promises not in the best interests of education. CO-ORDINATION Is NOT ENOUGH Our empiricism leads us often to dis- regard logic or pattern. For example, while youth employment is administered centrally by the Ministry of Labour with the help of a representative Ad- visory Council, its local administration is in some areas performed by the edu- cation authority and in others by re- gional officers of the Ministry of La- bour. Of the 181 education authori- ties in England, Scotland, and Wales, 121 have opted to administer this serv- ice; the largest authority, the London County Council, operates through nine- teen Youth Employment Committees. Again, when in 1948 the National Health Service was instituted, it was widely believed that as an inevitable sequitur the school health service, which had for nearly fifty years been a most valuable integral feature of the local education service, would be absorbed. Fortunately [to quote Dr. Alexander], greater wisdom prevailed. ... The advent of the National Health Service therefore merely strengthened the school medical service, since it made available the whole range of medical treatment to the school medical service.' At the close of his History of the English People 1Plie Halevy observes that it is difficult to understand us un- less you remember that this is essen- tially a free country with a vigorous group life. Even today with the state so active in education, there is a strong element of voluntary enterprise, espe- cially in adult education, youth work, and that educational borderland, com- munity centers and village halls. In all these spheres the local authority co- operates, and with deliberate unobtru- siveness seeks to introduce some degree of co-ordination. During the last war an attempt was made to establish a youth service, which was to be a sys- tem of partnership between local au- thorities and voluntary bodies engaged in the provision of youth clubs and other projects for youth. It was suc- cessfully launched; local authorities constituted Youth Committees and ap- pointed Youth Organizers, while the voluntary bodies themselves established at the national level a Standing Con- ference of Voluntary Youth Organi- zations, which fulfills a co-ordinating 6William P.

But during these postwar years other urgent needs, particularly the building of new schools and the creation of a system of universal sec- ondary education, have had to receive prior attention; and although there is no lack of co-ordinating machinery, feeling is growing that the time is ripe for another purposeful drive in the in- terests of youth. County colleges, in- cluded in the Education Act to supply continued education for young workers, have not yet been established, and it must be admitted that the youth serv- ice has in many areas lost some of its first ardor, while economic conditions and the claims of other services have limited the funds available for its de- velopment. When the wartime govern- ment introduced its scheme for the youth service, it was careful to say that "coordination is not enough." 8 That comment has now almost a pro- phetic ring as regards the youth serv- ice, and most will agree that in adminis- tering education it is a maxim of gen- eral significance. 8 Board of Education Circular, No. 1486.
