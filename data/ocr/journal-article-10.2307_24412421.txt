<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renaissance Studies Vol. 4 No. 2 Leisure and idleness in the Renaissance: the ambivalence of otium Brian Vickers [The first part of this essay can be found in Volume 4, No. 1 of this Journal.] III While no detailed studies exist of the later fortunes of these terms, in the Latin church fathers otium continues to have largely negative associa tions. In his Vulgate Jerome used otium or otiositas in the appropriate places to describe idleness:84 'Multam malitiam docuit otiositas' (Eccles. 33.29); 'Ecce haec fuit iniquitas Sodomae sororis tuae, superbia, saturitas panis, et abundantia; otium ipsius &amp; filiarum eius' (Ezech. 16.49). In Proverbs the virtuous woman 'looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness' (31.27, panem otiosa non comed.it). This book of the Bible is full of attacks on idleness: 'The sluggard [piger] will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing' (20.4); 'Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise; / Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, / Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. / How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? / Yet a little sleep, a little folding of thy hands to sleep / so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man' (6.6-11). 'As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. / The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth' (26.14-15). 'Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger' (19.15; see also 12.24, 27; 14.23; 24.30-4). St Paul denounces those younger widows who have cast off their faith and 'begun to wax wanton': 'And withal they learn to be idle [otiosas], wan dering about from house to house: and not idle, but tattlers also and busy bodies . . (1 Tim. 5.11-13). Some 'Patrum Sententiae' quoted in the Polyanthea, that popular florilegium, include such sweeping denuncia tions as these: 'Otiosum verbum est, quod sine utilitate loquentis &amp; audientis dicitur: quale quod de rebus frivolis dicitur, &amp; fabulas antiquas 84 I take the following quotations from the entry for otium in Florilegii Magni, seu Polyantheae Floribus Novissimis Sparsae, Libri XX (Frankfurt, 1628), originally compiled by Dominicus Nanus Mirabellius, revised by Joseph Langius and Fr.

The children of acedia are said to be idleness (otiositas), som nolence and restlessness, and in fact Cassian's main target - appropriately enough in a self-sustaining monastic community dependent on the work of all its members - is not acedia in the sense of 'dejection or boredom but simply idleness [otium or otiositas]'. As Siegfried Wenzel notes, otium oc cupies 'at least seventeen of the twenty-five chapters devoted to the vice, and once the two terms are even verbally equated', when Cassian refers to 'whoever is overcome by the sleep of idleness or acedia' (quisque somno otii vel acediae superatus).87 Other church fathers attacked otium as fruitless idleness, the enemy of virtue, the source of all vices: 'Nullus fruc tus otii, uno magis dispendum' (August., Epist. ad V ercellensesp, 'Fugienda est otiositas, mater nugarum, noverca virtutum' (Bernardus, De considera tion, lib. 2.13); 'Ociositas inimica est animi' (St Benedict, Regula, 48).88 St Pirminius, attacking acedia in his Scarapsus (710-24), a missionary's handbook, quotes several of these sententiae, urging 'he who was acediosus, which is idleness, [to] work with his own hands or do good in some craft, whereby he himself can live and give to others', while Hrabanus Maurus, in his De ecclesiastica disciplina (842-7), also equates acedia with otiositas, being 'a harmful sluggishness which renders man useless to any good work and pushes him to his destruction', for 'the idle man grows dull in carnal desires, is cheerless in spiritual works . . ,'.89 85 Ibid., cols 35-6. 86 See the outstanding studies by Morton Bloomfield, The Seven Deadly Sins. An Introduction to the History of a Religious Concept, with Special Reference to Medieval English Literature (East Lan sing, Mich., 1952, repr. 1967), and Siegfried Wenzel, The Sin of Sloth. Acedia' in Medieval Thought and Literature (Chapel Hill, NC, 1967). Fritz Schalk ÇOtium in Romanischen', op. cit. in note 7 above) records that 'im Spätlatein taucht nun eine neue Bildung auf: otiositas, . . . meist in Verbindung mit malitia, acedia, inquietudo, pervagatio, usw.' (p. 231). Quoting several examples, he comments that 'In der christlichen Antike, im christlichen Latein erscheint . . . die otiositas sehr oft im Katalog der Todsünden, synonym mit der so viel wie mit der Trägheit gleichgesetzten acedia' (p. 232). Jean Delumeau, in his wide-ranging study Le péché et la peur. La culpabilisation en Occi dent (XIIT-XVIII6 siècles) (Paris, 1983), discussing 'La Paresse' (pp. 255-64), and strangely ignorant of the books by Bloomfield and Wenzel, refers to a study by Jacques le Goff and others of a book of exempla by the Dominican Arnold of Liège, Alphabetum narrationum (c. 1308-10), in which Ocium appears alongside Neglicencia, Accidia and Pigricia (p. 255). 87 Inst., 10.21; Wenzel 1967, 19-22, 38. As he notes (pp. 211-12), the two vices had already been connected by Evagrius. 88 See Polyantheae, ed. cit., s.w. acedia and otium; Wenzel 1967, 35, 85, 229; Bloomfield 1952, 193, 242, 420 n. 63, 440 n. 255. 89 Wenzel 1967, 35-7.</page><page sequence="3">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 109 That description of the progressive decline of the idle was one of the great deterrent resources of medieval moralists. In his commentary on the Aeneicl Servius had described the slothful as born under Saturn, subject to torpor and lassitude, desiring 'nothing but to lie, rest, and sleep', as so many medieval treatises put it.90 In such a state he was not only in danger of losing his soul, open to all kinds of evil, but he would also lose the ability to work, and thus not fulfil the necessity of labour which God had im posed on a man as a consequence of the Fall.91 Not even moving his limbs, the otiosus would gradually lose the use of them, or be made to feel pain there by a punishment appropriate to the crime. In one medieval wall-painting those guilty of sloth are gnawed in the feet by an animal; in Richard Rolle's Pricke of Conscience the slothful are warned that they will 'suffer "potagre" and gout in their limbs'; a fifteenth-century vision of seven deformed figures being led into Hell's mouth describes some as hav ing 'fete also gnawyn and bun as pai were brokyn and bolned leggys. pt are slewthy caytyfs [slothful rogues] pt will not labour in gode works for pe hele of pair salues'.92 In the largest of these collections of hortatory material, William Peraldus' Summa de vitiis et virtutibus (c.1236), many biblical figures are introduced as warnings against sleep or idleness. Divine grace can be destroyed by 'the torpor of accidia, which "renders man incapable of doing any good by maiming his hands and feet, like Adonibezet" (Judges 1.7 - a Canaanite whom the Israelites captured, 'and cut off his thumbs and his great toes'). Alternatively the man with the withered hand (Matth. 12.10) was taken by Peraldus and Bromyard as a type of the accidiosus.94 The inactivity of the idle, these moralists warned, would spread through their whole body, and into their environment. In Grosseteste's Templum Domini, 'sloth is dead flesh and palsy' (Peraliticus and caro mortua as one manuscript puts it), and paralysis became a frequent theme in sermons against idleness.95 Unwilling to move, it was not surpris ing that the otiosus should be compared to stagnating water: John of Bromyard used this analogy, as did Peraldus, who quoted the appropriate verses from Ovid's Epistulae ex Ponto: 'cernis ut ignavum corrumpant otia corpus, /' ut capiant vitium, ni moveantur, aquae'96 (1.5.5-6: 'You see how inactivity spoils an idle body, how water acquires a taint unless it is in motion.' 'For me, too', Ovid continues, 'whatever skill I had in shap ing song is failing, diminished by inactive sloth'). In the fifth circle of Hell Dante submerged those guilty of acedia in swamps.97 In a fifteenth-century 90 Bloomfîeld 1952, 49, 233; Wenzel 1967, 17, 81.

A German moralist of the fifteenth century warns that 'lust, drunkenness, voracity, idleness [otiositas] and similar vices dissolve men, so that by serving carnal desires they pass into mud'98 - unglorious mud. The treatises attacking the Seven Deadly Sins were not only negative: from the time of Cassian onwards they include a specific remedium for each vice. The remedy for sloth, as we may easily guess, is work, and especially work with the hands. From those verses in Proverbs characteriz ing the slothful man as putting his hand in his bosom (19.24; 26.15), burying his hand in his armpit because he doesn't intend to work, to the allegorical character Oiseuse in a pilgrimage of human life, who 'carries one hand under her armpit while the other plays with a glove',99 the non use of the hands was seen as a particularly serious offence. Aristotle's praise of the hand as the 'instrument of instruments' was known through Galen, among other sources, and Christian moralists such as Origen and Lactantius had celebrated the excellence of the human body as proof of God's love of mankind.100 The idle man was deliberately flaunting the Creation, therefore manual work would be essential if he wanted to redeem his soul. Master Ralph of Acton added his contribution to this canonization of hard work: ' "Labour of the hands confers four benefits. It destroys vices, it nourishes virtues, it provides necessaries, it gives alms." As a fifteenth-century sermon puts it, 'hit ys the wylle of Gode that every man and woman schuld labour besyly. For yf Adam and Eve had ben occupyed wyth labour, the serpent had not overcum them: for ydulnesse ys the devylles dyssyr.' As one moralist admonished, 'nothing in this life is worth so much for body and soul as well-ordered work', so that 'he who would give up the joy of everlasting life takes care, says Scripture, that he does not work at all in this life'.102 The well-known injunctions of St Paul to the Thessalonians, 'study ... to work with your own hands' (1 Thess. 4.11), for 'if any would not work neither should he eat' (2 Thess. 3.10), were among the many biblical texts which were quoted to prove " Wenzel 1967, 122, 172, " Ibid., 124-5. 100 See Aristotle, De partibus animalium, iv.x: 687a 5ff; Galen, De usu partium, bk i: Galen on the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body, trans.

In Purgatorio VII Virgil points out Ottokar, who, whatever his faults, 'was better far than bearded Wenceslaus, his son, who is fed by lust and idleness' (cui lussuria e ozio pasce: 100-2). In Paradiso XI Dante mocks the 'insensate care of mortals', pursuing false goals: 'one was moiling, caught in the pleasures of the flesh, and another was giving himself to idleness' (che si dava a I'ozio: 8-9) while he, 'free from all these things', rejoiced in heaven with Beatrice.104 Traditionally given a pivotal role between medieval and Renaissance consciousness, Petrarch resembles, appropriately enough, his great hero Cicero in the frequency with which he invokes otium and the range of meanings he gives it. As the history of Petrarch scholarship shows, his philosophy has caused problems to modern commentators, being rhetori cal rather than systematic. That is, instead of a coherent and steadily evolving system, which is what we expect of a philosopher, Petrarch's utterances will vary according to the context, and the specific case which he is arguing. In one work he can support the active life, in another the contemplative, but this does not mean that his writings are simply a mass of contradictions.105 In the literature of moral counsel different occasions demand different treatment, depending on the person addressed, and the issues at stake. In his treatise De vita solitaria (started 1346, completed 1371)'06 Petrarch argues in favour of 'solitude', against 'society': but his diatribe is really directed not against the human race but against all the dirt, noise and corruption of city life. Nor is solitude to be taken literally, for he envisages his retreat to peace and quiet being accompanied by some sympathetic friends, and well supplied with books. Petrarch can en visage leaving the town for the country, but he could never recommend a life of idleness, self-indulgence or sensuality.107 As he sums up his treatise, 103 Wenzel 1967, 20-2, 76, 11 Iff, 150.

In Rhetoric and Philosophy in Renaissance Humanism (Princeton, NJ, 1968), 44-52, J. E. Seigel quoted and endorsed this account of 'contradictions' in Petrarch without in fact understanding their rhetorical form.

Humanity and Divinity in Italian Humanist Thought (2 vols, London, 1974), and The Poet as Philosopher. Petrarch and the Forma tion of Renaissance Consciousness (New Haven, Conn, and London, 1979).

Zeitlin, 99, 131, 136, 156, 165-6, 230, 237, 240, 246, 277, 291, 297, 300, 301. Zeitlin notes (p. 67)</page><page sequence="6">112 Brian Vickers I mean a solitude that is not exclusive, leisure that is neither idle nor profitless but productive of advantage to many [otium non iners nec in utile, sed quod e solitudine prosit multis]. For I agree that those who in their leisure are indolent, sluggish and aloof [Qui enim otiosi prorsus et languidi et segnes et soli sunt . . .] are always melancholy and un happy, and for them there can be no performance of honorable actions, no absorption in dignified study, no intercourse with distinguished personalities.108 In solitude Petrarch still espouses all the values of the vita activa, despising idleness and sloth. In a matching moral treatise, the De otio religiosorum]09 (begun in 1347, revised and completed about a decade later, when the title was changed to De otio religioso), Petrarch adopts a similar rhetorical ploy to the De vita solitaria, celebrating the tranquillity of the monastery over the unending and meaningless bustle of secular life. In preferring one kind of society over another Petrarch has not forgotten the negative associations of otium. The tranquillity of monastic life derives from its dedication to God, and to His peace, as summed up in the verse Petrarch quotes from the Psalms: Vacate et videte quoniam ego sum Deus, 'Be still, and know that I am God' (Ps. 46.10). But the monks have withdrawn from secular society not to indulge themselves in idleness, rather to fight against the world, the flesh and the devil, appealing to divine grace to overpower the lusts of the body.110 The virtues needed to overcome these enemies are traditional to the militia Christi, constant vigilance and self-control. Further, Petrarch invokes the ethos of Roman social and political values, in " 'an example drawn from the gentiles" where not only Cato but Appius Claudius and Quintus Metellus warned lest "security, otium and quies overturn what fear, negotium and trouble kept in full vigour'".1" With his long dedication to recovering and correcting the text of Livy, Petrarch must have been very familar with the values of the mos maiorum. As with all of Petrarch's moral works, his position is a selective amalgam of classical ethics and medieval Christianity. To the latter's de contemptu mundi tradition belong the frequent emphasis on the miseries of human life, its brevity, its fragility and the certainty of death (De otio religioso, pp. 654, 658, 722, 750, 772), including the recommendation to that in the De rebus memorandis Petrarch 'links Otium and Studium closely together and places them at the head of his book as forming its suitable threshold and portico'. 108 Ibid., 290; ed. Martelloti, 554-6. 109 For the Latin text see G. Rotondi's edition (completed by G. Martelloti), Il 'De Otio religioso' di Francesco Petrarca (Rome, 1958), and A.

The Christian (especially Pauline) concept of the constant war of spirit against flesh, which can be won if we receive God's grace (pp. 656, 694, 716, 720, 738, 748, 786), is joined to the classical moralists' attack on voluptas, in a tissue of quotations from Cicero, Seneca, Horace, Boethius, Lactantius, Augustine (pp. 722-78). In denouncing the destructive effects of luxuria, libido, gula and the other deadly sins (p. 740), Petrarch's diatribe in evitably includes many of the words and concepts associated with otium: 'Delicatissime res est amor ille carnalis; somno, quiete, cibis alitur . . .' (p. 728). The monks are warned against the dangers of languishing in a sense of safe tranquillity ('ne secura pace languidiores simus, sed exerciti cognoscamus unde timende cavendeque sint insidie': p. 608; 'ne una cum pace pacis comités securitas inconsulta ac molles affectus, denique luxus et vitia revertantur': p. 614; 'nutritus in pascuis voluptatum letis ac mollibus': p. 736). The remedy against idleness is the cultivation of virtus, on classical models (pp. 772, 778, 786). Petrarch does cite biblical texts, such as 'Go to the ant, thou sluggard' (p. 594), but the overwhelming majority of his quotations come from classical sources, such as a favourite passage from Livy (30.14.11) where Scipio Africanus advises Massinissa, king of Numidia, not to give in to desire: 'Vince animum' (p. 734), or familiar allusions to Cicero's attacks on Epicureanism and hedonism in the speech against Verres (p. 728), the De finibus (p. 722), De senectute (pp. 730-2) and De officiis (p. 738). Within Petrarch's Christian frame is a solid centre of Roman values, as there was indeed in another distinguished exemplar of the union of classical and Christian culture, St Augustine, from whose De vera religione (the work to which Petrarch gave credit for converting him to Christianity) he quotes a passage echoing that from the Psalms on which De otio religioso is based: 'Agite otium, inquit, et agnoscetis quia ego Dominus: non otium desidie, sed otium cogitationis, ut a locis ac temporibus vacet' (p. 668). Leisure must be used fruitfully. Petrarch's tendency to argue for or against a moral position takes the form, in his Secretum112 (written between 1347 and 1353), of three dia logues between himself and his beloved St Augustine, held in the presence of Truth. The persona of the poet confesses the weaknesses which cause his unhappiness and lack of spiritual progress, while Augustine as a moral authority admonishes and instructs him. Petrarch is suffering from 'a 112 For the Latin text, with Italian translation, see Bufano, Opere latine, 1.43-259; for an English version see Petrarch's Secret or the Soul's Conflict with Passion, trans. W. H. Draper (London, 1911 ; Westport, Conn., 1978). Quotations in the text are prefixed with B for the former, D for the latter edition. To the quotation from the Remedia amoris that Petrarch makes here Bufano (p. 215n) cites appositely from his letters (Fam. xvi.14.15) the statement, 'animo passionibus obsesso nil otio peius, nil solitaria libertate damnosius': 'for the mind obsessed with passions there is nothing worse than leisure, nothing more damaging than solitary freedom, since they lead to obscene thoughts, deceitful lust, flattering evil, and that familiar plague of idle minds, love': trans.

Rerum familiarum libri IX-X VI (Baltimore, Md, 1982), 326.</page><page sequence="8">114 Brian Vickers terrible plague of the soul - melancholy; which the moderns call accidie, but which in old days used to be called aegritudo - alluding to the Tusculan Disputations, Book 3 of which is devoted to its cure (D 84, 99; B 140, 158). Although Augustine initially praises his 'alert and watchful' words, those of a man who cannot 'bear to be idle and trust to chance' (neque enim otiosi et a casu pendentis: D 34; B 84) - inserting otium into the traditional opposition between virtus and fortuna - as the work pro ceeds Petrarch's alter ego continually reminds him that he will only be free from the yoke of fortune 'when, caring not a straw for human passions, you bend your neck wholly to the rule of virtue' (D 71-2; B 126), for 'it is virtue only that makes the happiness of man' (D 12, B 58) - a familiar principle in Cicero. In happier days, Augustine recalls, Petrarch was 'never idle', pondering 'some high meditation, with only the Muses for your friends - you were never less alone than when in their company' (D 64; B 118). From that ideal state of Scipio, as celebrated by Cicero, Petrarch has fallen away, betraying the ethos of the vita activa in which man should devote his talents to the service of others (D 94-5; B 154), retreating into himself and shunning human company. The main cause of Petrarch's falling-off, discussed at length in the third dialogue, is his love for Laura. The poet confesses that when, as a young man he too faced, like Hercules, the crucial choice of life, he took the left-hand path, down to sensual desires, not the harder uphill road to vir tue (D 128-30; B 190-2). Since 'the first effect of love is blindness' (D 129; B 192), Petrarch has lost all moral judgement, for as Augustine reminds him, quoting the Tusculans (4.35.75), love is the most violent of all the passions in the soul (D 132; B 196). Among the stock symptoms that Pet rarch suffered was 'a melancholy love for being alone, avoiding all your fellow-men' (D 133; B 196). Augustine warns him to 'avoid solitude', citing those lines (quoted above) from Ovid's Remedia amoris (579ff) ad vising the lover that loca sola nocent, to which Petrarch replies: 'I remember them perfectly, and knew them almost by heart from my child hood' (D 149-50; B 214). From his school education Cicero and Ovid have stood as equal authorities in the remedies for love: Petrarch cites their agreement that an old love is best driven out by a new (D 138; B 202), and itemizes Cicero's further remedies: 'Satiety, Shamefastness, Reflection' (D 152ff; B 216ff). Augustine reminds the persona Petrarch of 'reason, the true source of all remedies'. Ratio is 'that citadel wherein alone you can be quite safe against the incursions of passion and by which alone you will deserve the name of Man' (D 162; B 228). The work con cludes with Petrarch, chastened, resolving 'to attend only to the care of my soul, to relinquish every bypath and follow the straight . . . way of salvation' (D 192; B 258). The Secretum is more autobiographical confessional than Petrarch's other moral works, but it derives from the same coherent ethical system, in which the obstacles to salvation include accidie, otium, solitude and sensual love.</page><page sequence="9">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 115 The Roman judgement on otium finds full, and fitting, expression in Petrarch's longest and most comprehensive moral work, the De remediis utriusque fortune (started c. 1354, completed 1366),113 consisting of some 254 dialogues between Ratio and the personified interlocutors: in Book one, Gaudium and Spes, enjoying and expecting good fortune, and in Book two, Dolor and Timor, faced with evil fortune. This arrangement, partly deriving from classical models (Aristotelian and Ciceronian ethics), allows Petrarch to cover a wide range of topics in moral philosophy."4 The twenty-first dialogue of Book one is entitled De ocio et quiete, and is prefixed (in some editions) with the (unidentified) verses Nulla est certa qules, cunctis crux una ferenda est, Post liceat stabili fata quiete frui."s In this as in all the dialogues Petrarch achieves a fine ironic effect by hav ing each personification of the human passion concerned declare the same opinion or desire throughout, oblivious to the lesson that Ratio is giving it. So here Gaudium proclaims variations on the sentence Delectabile ocium est mihi ('This quietnesse is very pleasant unto mee') while Ratio delivers a denunciation of the misuse of otium and quies, 'two most ac ceptable commodities of mans lyfe' until overused, when they produce 'as many plagues to the body, as diseases to the minde: swellyng to the one, and rust to the other'. Having revived the metaphor of rust for inactivity (which, as we have seen, goes back to Cato), Petrarch gives Ratio a suc cinct definition of two kinds of otium, echoing that in De otio religioso: One is busy, which even in very rest is doing somewhat, and busie about honest affayres, and this is very sweete: The other is slouthful and idle, and geven onely to sluggyhnes, than which there is nothyng more loathsome, or more lyke to the grave. The first type of otium produces 'magna quaedam opera, et mundo utilia, et suis authoribus gloriosa proveniunt', the second 'nothyng but in glorious slouth and sleepiness', the life of sluggards and feeders. Undeterred, unable to take in the words of Reason, Joy continues to drone 'Dormio, et quiesco', and 'Ociosus in thalamo requiesco'. Ratio 11 i Alberto del Monte was announced as preparing a critical edition for the EcLizione Nazionale of Petrarch, and issued, over thirty years ago, his Prime Schede per I'edizione critica del De Remediis' (Turin, 1954). Until his edition appears scholars must continue to use the notoriously defective early separate printings. The spirited translation by Thomas Twyne, Phisicke against Fortune, as well pros perous, as adverse, conteyned in two Bookes (London, 1579), was briefly available in a modern fac simile edition, with an introduction by Benjamin G.

Idleness is to be rejected, once again, as the an tithesis of virtue. Which of these, I pray thee, thinkest thou rested more pleasantly: either Vatia116 whiche lay sleeping at his farme in the countrey, or Scipio fighting against his enimies in Africa, and Cato against serpentes, and Regulas against both? For there is neyther quietnes without joy, neither can there be any joy without vertue. . . . Toyle and laboure are the matters of vertue and glory, who so rejecteth these, re jecteth them also. (A point to be remembered in Marvell's 'Garden'.) Instead of sleeping all night Joy should 'watche some part of the nyghtes in making prayers to God, and among thy bookes, for the true glory, and a large gayne'. Since GaucLium continues to mumble, 'Somno placido delector', Ratio makes the sarcastic comment, 'yee change not your copie, ye deale in all matters after one maner', and denounces the human tendency to turn the gifts of God, nature or art to shame and uselessness: 'your drinke to drunkennes, your meate to surfeityng, your leysure to sleepinesse [ocium et quietem ad somnolentiam et marcorem], your good health to voluptuousnesse, your beautie to lasciviousnesse', and so on through an ever more biting cata logue of human sins. To anyone ignorant of the tradition distrusting otiumin this diatribe might seem excessive. But Petrarch is drawing on a long line of authors, classical and patristic, closing with a quotation from Jerome's letters to Eustochius advising him to rise two or three times during the night and meditate on the Bible, resting only when weary, 'lest that by sleeping all the night long, and lying styl upon the pillowe, ye appeare to be as it were buried carkases [sepulta cadavera]: By the often and coomely styrring of your selves, declare that ye are alyve, and geven to vertue'. Otium mis used is the enemy of virtue, the associate of all forms of sin. This point is 116 Schottlaender {op. cit., p. 289), believes that Petrarch invented the name of Vatia for the type of idleness: but of course it comes from Seneca, Epistle 55. Of Petrarch's opposing exempla of virtue, Scipio and Atilius Regulus would have been familiar from his work on Livy, especially Books 29 and 30 of the third decade (Scipio), and the summary of the lost 18th Book (Regulus), while Cato's virtue was celebrated in many Latin works: Lucan's Pharsalia, ix.379-410 is especially relevant, a passage quoted in one of Petrarch's letters (p. 290). 117 This category includes, regrettably, Maristella Lorch, offering to treat 'Petrarch, Cicero, and the classical pagan tradition' in Renaissance Humanism. Foundations, Forms, and Legacy, ed. Albert Rabil, Jr (3 vols, Philadelphia, Pa, 1988), I, 71-94. Professor Lorch finds a 'significant dif ference' between the two writers in that 'Petrarch's constant longing was for otium or seclusion as the essential condition for his studies, while Cicero, on the contrary, longed for negotium or public in volvement. . . . Otium means "leisure, vacant time, freedom from business". In the case of Cicero it means primarily "literary activity" . . . '. As this passage and the discussion following (pp. 77-82) will show, Lorch is blind to the traditionally pejorative associations of otium, and her attempt to force Petrarch and Cicero into opposite camps ignores their very substantial agreement on the funda mental issues of moral philosophy.</page><page sequence="11">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 117 made implicitly in the second book of De remediis utriusque fortune, in a sequence of dialogues (105-11) dealing with the deadly sins: covetousness, envy and malice, wrath, gluttony, pride, lechery and sloth. In De torpore animixx% Dolor complains of being 'slouthful, and sluggysh to ryse unto any good Woorkes', thus incapable of virtue, and is counselled by Ratio to remember above all 'the swyftnesse of tyme in passyng away'. Given the brevity of life, we must set love of virtue on the one side (which will arouse courage and resolution), and fear of death on the other, never forgetting 'how muche tyme ye have spent in idlenesse [quantum transient ociosi]'. In classical, as in Renaissance moral thought, the vices and sins are interrelated: one eases the way for the others. So in the following dialogue, De luxuria,119 Reason declares that 'Letcherie is begotten by slouthfulnesse, and brought forth by gluttonie'. The interrelatedness of the vices is brought out also in the quotation chosen as epigraph for this dialogue, which is none other than that by now familiar distich from Ovid's Remedia Amoris, Ocia si tolles, periere cupidinis arcus, Contemplaeque iacent, et sine luce, faces. Reason's harangue against lechery aligns itself firmly with the classical moral tradition denouncing voluptas: Heare what the best learned have judged, and written concernyng this matter. 'Pleasures', sayth Cicero, 'beying most flatteryng Ladyes, do wreast the greater partes of the mynde from vertue.' 'To this end', sayth Seneca, 'they embrace us, that they may strangle us . . .' Livy, too, is drawn on again for that saying of Scipio Africanus to Massanissa: 'Vanquishe thy minde, and take heede thou doo not deforme many good giftes with one vice . . .' The indulgence of the body, or its search for otium, can lead not just to 'the sluggishness of the soul', in capable of good works, but to 'everlasting damnation'. As Petrarch's authoritative example shows, in the De remediis tradition moral philosophers often grouped otium with gluttony and lechery: this is still the case in Spenser's pageant of the Seven Deadly Sins.120 Yet, as Ovid became a school author, his Remedia amoris, and even the Ars amatoria - that spoof of a didactic poem - began to be cited as serious authorities by the manuals of exempta for sermon-writers and other moralists. (Petrarch, we recall, as a schoolboy had learned parts of the Remedia by heart.) It might have given Ovid a wry pleasure to realize that his celebra tions of otium and Amor, together with his palinodes against otium as the prior condition for love, became grist to the mill of the medieval preachers, all treated with equal solemnity.

W. Robertson has recorded, 'this became a favourite medieval quotation, since it seemed strikingly harmonious with principles of Christian morality'. Richard de Bury's Philobiblon sets philosophia, the mother of all good things, against the vices of the flesh, and especially idleness, the state in which Cupid's shafts can arouse sensual desire ('. . . ocio penitus effugato, quo sublato "periere Cupidinis arcus omnes" '), while Guido Faha, in his Summa de viciis et virtutibus, paraphrases Ovid's words 'for the specific purposes of moral theology'. In his popular Lilium medicinae the fourteenth-century physician Bernard of Gordon argues that as a remedy for love-sickness 'idleness should be avoided on the authority of Ovid, "If you take away idleness, Cupid's bow is broken" ', and he solemnly quotes Ovid's other suggestions in that book for overcom ing love: find work to do, travel, or even (!) cultivate the love of other women (Rem. am., 150-2, 441-2).122 Ovid's connection of otium with fleshly delight is widely acknowledged to be the reason why the porter who controls admission to the garden of love in the Roman de la Rose is called Oiseuse, and is given 'the conventional Gothic attributes of luxuria , the mirror and the comb.123 Robertson has connected her with Narcissus, and with the destructiveness of self-love, while the dance to which Déduit and Oiseuse invite us he shows to be the 'Old Dance', a distinct form in medieval art, accompanied by a bagpipe, and leading to the domination of Cupid and Venus.124 (The bagpipe was a common symbol for lechery.) Gardens of love, as the experienced reader or student of art history knows only too well, often turn out to be gardens of vice, or at any rate of lost virtue. In the Temple of Venus described in 'The Knight's Tale' Chaucer follows Boccaccio's Teseida in describing the concupiscible Venus and her effects - including 'Desir, Foolhardynesse . . .

In the translation by Charles Dahlberg the 'sweet and lovely girl' occupies herself solely with her appearance: 'It certainly seemed from her array that she was hardly busy.

She led a good and happy life, for she had no care nor trouble except only to turn herself out nobly. ... "I am called Idleness", she said, "by people who know me. I am a rich and powerful lady, and I have a very good time, for I have no other purpose than to enjoy myself and make myself com fortable, to comb and braid my hair.

Nat was foryeten the porter, Ydelnesse, Ne Narcisus the faire of yore agon . . .I2i The ultimate source for these ambivalent gardens may be, as Paul Wat son suggests, Claudian's Epithalamium for the Emperor Honorius (398 AD), in which a garden of love offers ver perpetuum, but includes such negative inhabitants as Licentia, Ira, Excubia, Pallor, Audacia, et non secura Voluptas,126 In Brunetto Latini's Tesoretto (1262 and later), the poet passes through the country of Virtue and 'stumbles into the mutable garden of Pleasure' - for Piacere is by definition ephemeral - from which he only escapes after having learned about the true nature of love from 'Ovidio maggiore' and his Ars amatoria, once again applied to didactic purposes. On emerging from the garden Brunetto 'confesses and does penance for his sin'.127 Equally dangerous is the garden of Venus to which Cupid leads his captives in Petrarch's Trionfo d'Amore, where 'manly thoughts are banished, idleness casts an evil spell, and mad confusion finally reigns'.128 Such attitudes to love were taken over, as Watson shows, into ecclesiastical art of the trecento, with its 'monumental frescoes warn ing of the horrors of death, urging repentance as a way to salvation, and condemning love as a vain enterprise'.129 One such fresco is the Exposi tion of Death in the Camposanto of Pisa, which may now be dated to the 1340s, where a company of noble people is depicted in a garden, with two musicians, and putti with inverted flaming torches (symbolizing the ef fects of love) hovering over a couple seated on a bench. Verses on a scroll reveal that the company in the grove represents a deterrent picture of the life of the senses and corporeal pleasure, feminine beauty being a specific instance of the general law that 'pleasure is vain, transitory, and sinful'.130 Another fresco showing a garden of vain love is the 'Way to Salvation' in the Spanish Chapel of S. Maria Novella, painted by Andrea Bonaiuti in 1366-7, which Watson connects with the Ammaestramentidegliantichi 125 Ibid., 370-1; Teseida, 7.50ff; Knight's Tale, 1918-44. 126 Paul F.

Watson detects evidence of an adulterous relationship, with the cupids singling out 'for extinction a vain lady moved by adulterous passion'.</page><page sequence="14">120 Brian Vickers of Bartolomeo da San Concordio, a Dominican theologian who died in Pisa in 1347 but who had lived in S. Maria Novella while writing this work, which continued to be used there throughout the trecento.131 These 'Admonishments of the ancients' consist of maxims from the Bible, church fathers and pagan authors, applied to the topics of sin, death and salvation - including, naturally enough, acidia. Bartolomeo follows the medieval tradition of equating acidia with idleness, and quotes the usual clerical authors, concluding with just that passage from Ovid's Remedia amoris quoted above: Quam platanus vino gaudet . . . Tam Venus otia amat (141-3), substituting for Venus luxuria, demythologized sensual pleasure, as the chief vice ('cosi la lussuria ama ozia'). Acidia is illustrated in Andrea's painting (fig. 1) by a man plunged in melancholy, his cheek supported by his hand, whose costume shows him to be a scholar (especi ally prone to this vice). Vasari correctly saw this garden as representing 'I piaceri e' diletti vani in figure umane', and the knowledgeable spectator can tick off the component symbols: the dog and a bird representing sen suality, a dance signifying fleshly delights (with an inescapably phallic bagpipe), and the children picking nuts and cherries - like the dog and the falcon - instances of gluttony, which Bartolomeo saw as 'the begin ning of all vices, [causing] the destruction of all virtues'. The only way out of this garden of the senses is through a narrow arched gate guarded by St Peter, leading to the bare and austere landscape of Paradise. Watson's useful study traces the secularization of the garden of vanity into the generally non-vicious garden of love in Florentine art, chronic ling the mysteriously sudden disappearance of the latter in the mid quattrocento.132 However, a longer time-scale would have shown that the garden of vices, and the iconographical connotations attached to them, continued into the next century and beyond. In Cesare Ripa's familiar Iconologia, for example, Accidia (fig. 2) sits supporting her head with one hand and holding in the other the torpedo-fish, whose sting causes paralysis and inertia.133 Of the four schemes that Ripa proposes for Otio,n4 three involve a figure which is 'corpolento' or 'grasso, per li pochi pensieri, i quali non danno noia per la troppa occupatione del pensiero, &amp; dell'intelletto, alia dilatatione del sangue per le membra'. One figure 131 Ibid., 56-60. On this fresco see also the celebrated discussion by Millard Meiss, Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death (Princeton, NJ and New York, 1964), 33, 39ff, 94-104, especially pp. 97-8. Fritz Schalk (op. cit. in note 7 above) records the definition by Jacopo da Benevento, a trecento author: 'L'accidia è pigrizia, owero ozio, è madré délia vanità e madriga delle virtute' (p. 242). 132 Ibid., pp. 61ff. Although largely favourable to love, these paintings still contain reminders of the danger of the senses, to which Watson might have been more alert had he realized the negative connotations often applied to such words as voluptas and amoenitas. For the continuing tradition of the garden as a place perilous see K. J. Hellerstedt, Gardens of Earthly Delight: Sixteenth and Seventeenth-Century Netherlandish Gardens (Pittsburgh, Pa, 1986).

Two of them are associated with the pig for its 'viltà e dapocagine' (from 'dappoco', 'useless, good-for-nothing'), since Aristotle described this animal as the least capable of 'ammaestramento', and the idle man is incapable of learning any praiseworthy occupation or even self-control, being wholly devoted to satisfying his own appetites. Another figure is attended by a ploughshare, rusty with disuse, signifying the idle man's inactivity in 'well doing' ('ben' oprare'), which renders him hateful to God and man. 'Per questo disse S.Gregorio [originally, Seneca] 1'otio esser una sepoltura dell'huomo vivo, &amp; la Scrittura, che tutti i mali del mondo gli hà insegnati l'otio.'

Totally opposed to such a value-scheme is the otiose old man, dressed in yellow for a masquerade, and displaying the motto In quiete voluptas. As throughout ethical discussions in the classical tradi tion of the virtues and vices, one vice encourages the others. The typical garden of vanity painting shows the vices in a static con text, arranged side by side in an apparently pleasant surrounding which actually signifies death and damnation. An alternative iconographical tradition, going back to Prudentius' Psychomachia, is essentially dynamic, representing the virtues overpowering the vices, or even trampling on them.135 In this tradition, too, the vices are shown in their true and repulsive state. This seems to be the line from which Mantegna drew in the greatest of these 'garden of vanity' paintings, the work commissioned by Isabelle d'Esté for her Studiolo in Mantua, usually called 'Minerva ex pelling the Vices from the garden of Virtue"36 (fig. 3) - although Ronald Lightbown, in his recent and outstanding monograph,137 convincingly identifies the goddess as Pallas. This painting is one of several commis sioned by Isabella in about 1492, having approached Mantegna, Giovanni Bellini and Perugino. As a patroness Isabella regularly gave painters working for her an invenzione or outline of the subject-matter she wanted, taking some mythological composition which had a definite moral. Mantegna painted two companion works for her study, a complex allegory of Parnassus (finished by 1497), and the Pallas expelling the Vices (prob ably finished in 1502). Both now hang in the Louvre, next to Perugino's Triumph over Chastity, also commissioned for her study, and delivered in 1505. Isabella's choice of subjects evidently reflects the virtues proper to women, especially chastity, and all three 'contain some representation of 135 See, e.g., Bloomfield 1952, and A. Katzenellenbogen, Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Medieval Art (London, 19S9). 136 The pioneering account of this painting was by Richard Foerster, 'Studien zu Mantegna und den Bildern im Studierzimmer der Isabella Gonzaga', Jahrbuch der Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen Berlin, 22 (1901), 78-87, 154-80, especially 159-63. A much fuller study, for many years the best available, is Egon Verheyen, The Paintings in the 'Studiolo' of Isabella d'Este at Mantua (New York, 1971), especially pp. 30-5, 38-41. There are brief but useful discussions by Jean Seznec, The Survival of the Pagan Gods, trans. B. F.

A Study in V enetian Humanism (Cambridge, Mass., 1948), 9-20, have aroused much negative criticism, in my view rightly. His discovery of the 'coincidence of opposites' everywhere in Renaissance art led him to link Mantegna's 'Parnassus' with 'Minerva ex pelling the Vices' in these terms: 'The severity of Virtue and the frivolity of Pleasure are represented in these two paintings as of equal force; for according to Renaissance etiquette, the well-balanced courtier was to admit them both' as 'conflicting powers in the soul which are to be harmonized as in music.

A secon dary theme, as Lightbown puts it, is 'virtuous leisure',138 since Isabella spent her leisure hours in her studiolo, practising otium honestum. Mantegna's second painting shows the goddess Pallas striding aggres sively into the garden infested by the vices, having been victorious in her first encounter (for the broken tip of her lance lies on the ground). On the extreme left is an olive, the tree of Pallas, its human shape (from the con ventional images of Daphne) personifying deserted virtue, and which bears a scroll crying for help: AGITE PELLITE NOSTRIS /FOEDA HAEC VICIORUM MONSTRA / VIRTUTUM COELITUS AD NOS REDEUNTIUM /DIVAE COMITES ('Come, divine companions of the Virtues who are returning to us from Heaven, expel these foul monsters of the Vices from our seats'139). The text is repeated in Greek, and in what might be called mock Hebrew.140 Although the three goddesses seem to be bearing down on Venus, their real goal is the liberation of the Mater Virtutum (Mother of the Virtues), 'whose cry for help written on the scroll comes out of the walled-in window of her cell: ET MIHI VIRTUTUM MATRI SUCCURITE DIVI' ('and you, o gods, succour me, the Mother of the Virtues').14' As if in answer to these pleas we see descending from the skies a cloud bearing Temperance, Justice and Fortitude, returning to the locus amoenus which had been usurped by the vices. Since they represent three of the four cardinal or moral virtues, Lightbown suggests that the puzzling reference to the 'mother of the virtues' (Philostratus called Truth the Mother of Virtue in the singular, but that hardly seems relevant here) must identify the imprisoned figure as 'Prudentia, the fourth moral Vir tue, figuring prudence and reason, which were considered indispensable to the acquisition of the other virtues'.142 This would certainly fit Renaissance moral philosophy, as with the central role of Ratio in Petrarch's De remediis, and the Christianization of the classical virtue tradition. The vices who have occupied the garden are shown in appropriately disgusting form. To the immediate right of Pallas is a woman carrying an armful of babies (how vice proliferates!) whose legs end in those of a goat, as do those of the child she is leading by the arm. Venus stands on the Ibid., 190. 139 Ibid., 202. Although Panofsky, Pandora's Box, 44, described it as a laurel (followed by Verheyen, p. 33), Foerster ('Studien zu Mantegna', 111) had long ago seen that it was an olive, appropriately enough, an olive branch being the traditional emblem for victory in war. 140 Foerster ('Studien zu Mantegna', 161) showed that the Hebrew inscription made no sense, but Wind (Feast of the Gods, 18 n, 37) says that 'it was customary in this humanist affectation to repeat precisely the same idea in all three languages'. Verheyen (p. 33 n. 56) decisively shows that the second script 'imitates Greek letters but is easily read as a shorter version of the first Latin text', and that 'the Hebrew "text" is only a fake'. 141 Verheyen, 31; Lightbown, 202. 143 Lightbown, 202-3. While paying tribute to Foerster's 'brilliant study of the iconography of the picture', Lightbown shows that his argument citing as analogous a version of the Calumny of Apelles, identifying the captive as Truth, does not hold: 266 n. 88.</page><page sequence="20">126 Brian Vickers back of a centaur, symbol of human depravity - virtue disappearing into bestial appetite, as in King Lear's mad-sane insight into his two daughters' 'riotous appetite': Down from the waist they are Centaurs, Though women all above; But to the girdle do the gods inherit, Beneath is all the fiends': there's hell . . . To the centaur's left is a moronic-looking satyr, personifying lust, carry ing a Cupid who is one of the first casualties of the battle. His 'azure wings have been cut off in the combat before the flight, and he now holds them in his left hand'.144 Yet Mantegna is too much of a realist to present the defeat of vice as instantaneous, and total. On the satyr's other shoulder perches a second and still winged Amor, 'brandishing two flaming torches with which to ignite the fires of love', while one of the fleeing companions of Venus 'holds a torch of wood and an end of wax wrapped round with smouldering tow, in allusion to the deceptive slowness with which the flames of love can be ignited'.145 Pallas is on the way to victory, we might say, but more persistence will be needed if vice is to be truly stamped out. The point of these details becomes fully clear once we notice the Latin in scription on the edge of the pond just below the goddess's right foot (fig. 4), Otia si tollas periere Cupidinis arcus, just that verse from the Remedia amoris which has figured in so many denunciations of otium.XAb The pond in the foreground is stagnant, as we can tell from the plants and weeds growing in it. On the extreme right are three ugly female figures, INGRATITUDO and AVARICIA carrying between them INIORAN CIA, a vice which occupies a prominent position in other works by Man tegna (notably the now-lost 'Virtus combusta' and 'Virtus deserta'), and in his private writings, one of his favourite sayings being virtuti semper adversatur ignorantiad47 The 'association of avarice and wantonness is a 143 King Lear, 4.6.124ff. 144 Lightbown, 205. Verheyen, 31-5, has evidently followed Foerster's identification of the two figures to the left of Venus as Diana (holding a bow and quiver) and Chastity (holding a torch), writing that Cupid's 'bow is carried by one of the maidens entering the garden from the back', while his torch is 'in the hand of a winged genius' who appears to be signalling 'the imminent liberation of the mother of virtue' (p. 35). However, Lightbown shows that these figures are unprepared for battle, and are shown in 'flight, not pursuit': the raised right hand of the one holding the bow 'in dicates terror and a call for aid to her mistress Venus' (pp. 206, 266 n. 103). 145 Lightbown, 205-6. 146 Foerster, 162, was the first to identify it. Seznec, Survival of the Pagan Gods, 109 n. 108, also cites the Proverbia rusticorum, 7: Opera cum mihi do, mihi praebet terga Cupido. Otia si sequeris, luxuriosus eris. ('When I work, Cupid turns his back upon me; if you give yourself over to idleness, you will become voluptuous.') 147 Foerster, 86; Lightbown, 205. On Mantegna's drawings of virtus combusta and virtus deserta, known from an engraving ascribed to Zoan Andrea, see Foerster, 78-87, Panofsky, Pandoras Box, 44-6, and Lightbown, Catalogue nos 193 and 200.</page><page sequence="21">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 127 I h wmwmmm yr MF Fig. 4 Detail of Figure 3. classical one', Lightbown observes, citing a sentence from Cicero's De oratore which has a similar structure to the ubiquitous verse from Ovid: 'If you wish to get rid of avarice, you must get rid of its mother, lascivious ness."48 The further point this makes, I suggest, is the mutually supportive allegiance between the vices so often condemned in classical and Chris tian texts. It is for this reason, surely, that Ignorance is portrayed as an 148 Lightbown, 205; De Or., 2.40.171: 'Avaritiam tollere si vultus, mater eius tollenda est luxuries'. On luxuries as 'profusion', the rankness or exuberant and useless growth of plants, see note 44 above. The fact that Ovid's Remedia amoris may have echoed Cicero is no accident, for his moral</page><page sequence="22">128 Brian Vickers inert figure, with several of the attributes of Sloth transferred to it, 'slumped in a pose of lethargic indifference, with dangling arms and vacant gaze'.149 As in Petrarch's dialogue De torpore animi, sloth is not only the enemy of virtue but of knowledge also, and it was a bitter touch of Mantegna to give Ignorance a crown, as if suggesting that he rules the world. In1 the middle of the pond stands a strange mixture of man, woman and ape, with a scroll identifying him as IMMORTALE ODIUM/ FRAUS ET MALITIAE, carrying on its person bags containing three degrees of evil, discord and suspicion. On the extreme left OTIUM, corpulent, unkempt and sleepy-eyed, with grotesque stumps of arms, is being led - if they are really making any progress - by INERTIA, who looks fearfully back at Pallas, the personification of active virtue. Thus Mantegna's painting has not literally brought about the transformation recommended by Ovid - 'Take away leisure and Cupid's bow is broken' - but has rather followed the tradition of all the moralists from Cato to Petrarch and beyond, anatomizing the vices that threaten man's body and soul, driven by sexual desire, supported by appetite and made possible by inactivity and idleness. Otium and the other vices will presumably be expelled from their stagnant pool, but Egon Verheyen believes that the emphasis of the picture as a whole is less on the expulsion of the vices than on the rescuing of virtue.150 It is hard to see how these two poles could be separated, so closely are they intertwined in Mantegna's composition and in the inven zione behind it. The painting's literary and ethical context has been much illuminated by Lightbown, whose work is a great advance on Verheyen151 (although neither of them seems to know of the long pejorative tradition associated with otium). The closest contemporary source that Lightbown has found is the Anteros (1496) of Battista da Campo Fregoso (better known to his contemporaries as Fulgosius). This is an attack on carnal love, following the mistaken interpretation put into circulation by Pietro Hedo in his Antierotica (1492) of Anteros as an enemy of carnal love (taking anti to mean contrary instead of equal or mutual), rather than a deity presiding over reciprocal love.152 The allegorical figures in the woodcut frontispiece to Fregoso's book are 'carefully labelled Inopia, Zelotypia, Derrisio, Luctus, works contain several discussions of the disturbances of the soul caused by the passions, and how these may be cured. See, e.g., Tusculan Disputations, 4.32.68-4.35.76 on sexual passion and its remedies. 149 Lightbown, 205. As he rightly observes, 'the special emphasis on otium demanded by the theme of the picture is expressed in the two allegorical groups, one of Ignorance and Avarice carry ing Sloth, the other of Inertia leading Idleness, who open and close the front plane of the composi tion'. His observation on this painting, that the vices 'move in parallel' (p. 207), is a general truth in the moral tradition. 150 Verheyen, 32-4. 151 Verheyen's main candidate (pp. 38-41) was Mario Equicola and his Libro di natura d'amore, but Lightbown shows that it came to Isabella's knowledge too late, and expresses a conception of Anteros 'totally opposed to that figured in the Parnassus (pp. 192-3). 152 Lightbown, 191-2.</page><page sequence="23">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 129 [Mors] Immatura and Mors Aeterno, while the remedies of love, Matri monium, Oratio, Negotia and Abstinentia, are inscribed on scrolls wound round the branches of a tree', just like Daphne's appealing cry in the Pallas.x 53 No one reading that list could fail to recall the remedies proposed by Ovid. Fregoso, drawing on all the approved moral authorities - Aris totle, Cicero, Seneca, Augustine, Jerome,154 - depicts love as an enemy of prudentia, disturbing the mind, reducing the lover to servitude and pro ducing suspicion and hatred. He begins his book by defining love in terms borrowed from Plato's Phaedrus, seeing it as 'a desire or unbridled ap petite conjoined with lust, incited by idleness and lasciviousness'. Once again luxuria, otium and lascivia work together, and Fregoso inevitably cites the verse from Ovid.'55 Another influence close at hand was the Gonzaga court poet Battista Spagnoli (better known as Mantuan). In his De calamitate temporum (1484) he introduces Virtue as Pallas, the scourge of crime, 'ever incor ruptible, flourishing and immortal', always ready to do battle with the vices. Pallas declares: ' "I know no delights: insidious pleasure has no treaty of peace with me; I have a dispute with the vices about the limits of my kingdom. . . . Assiduous toil makes me strong: idleness weakens me."' This work also contains an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, with Luxuria figured by Venus, attended by a train bearing her bows, arrows and 'the torch that lights the flames of lust', the enemy of chastity and reason. In an elegy Contra amorem Spagnoli writes that 'every lover becomes a beast while love rules', as with Mantegna's centaur, satyrs and goat-footed acolytes of Venus, while Cupid is described as praising 'soft delights, unguents, merriment and slothful ease [inertia ocia]', first deceiving then destroying.156 A further associate of Isabella, Fra Saba da Castiglione, wrote an essay entitled 'Cerca fuggir l'otio', in which he described idle leisure as 'the evil and vice most to be feared in this mortal life, as being the principle, origin, root and fomentation of every fault' -a denuncia tion which modern proponents of otium as innocuous leisure or vacant time could hardly understand. The only cure, as a long tradition agrees, is occupation of body and mind, the study of good authors and the cultiva tion of the appropriate virtues.157 Ronald Lightbown is obviously right in describing the discussion of vir tuous leisure as peculiarly appropriate to a learned lady devoting her many hours of free time to morally approved pursuits. This is undoubtedly a preoccupation of more concern to the leisured than to the working classes. But a general sense of guilt, or at least embarrassment attended many manifestations of otium in the Renaissance. It was a commodity for Ibid., 201. Ibid., 203, 206. 155 Ibid., 206.

Federico Gonzaga, having commissioned what Sir Ernst Gombrich calls an 'Aretinian' series of illustrations for the Sala di Psiche in his Palazzo del Te, caused an inscription to be added to the cornice stating that he had 'ordered this [room] to be built for honest leisure [honesto ocio] after work to restore strength in quiet'. We may wonder whether Isabella d'Este would have approved! But, as Gombrich shows, a theoretical pro nouncement justifying leisure was made by Lucas Gauricus, an associate of the marquis who had considerable influence on the planning of the astrological programme in the Sala dei Venti. In a treatise called De ocio libérait Gauricus pronounced, in the mode of Valerius Maximus, an indul gence for otium: 'this form of leisure is nothing but a kind of emptying and interruption of grave and serious matters, for the relaxation of the mind, and a certain restoration of the spirit which is not shameful, but rather honourable'.158 To more austere contemporaries, however, such pronouncements may have been another proof that qui s'excuse, s'accuse. IV One of the most interesting iconographie features of Mantegna's Otium, not discussed by Lightbown or previous Mantegna scholars, is its stump like arms. Whereas medieval moralists, as we have seen, ascribed various punishments to bodily limbs grown numb with disuse, such as gout or paralysis, Mantegna has gone further back, to a stage when Otium did not develop arms, since it never intended to use its hands. As in some grotesque evolutionary reversal, that which was not to be used simply never grew. A striking expression of this idea comes in Cicero's De natura deorum, attacking anthropomorphic conceptions of the gods (1.25.71ff), and especially the paradox that Epicurus denies the gods any activity, but still gives them human limbs, which would be superfluous: 'Does not even a consideration of the adaptation of man's limbs to their functions con vince you that the gods do not require human limbs? What need is there for feet without walking, or for hands if nothing has to be grasped', or for the other 'parts of the body, in which nothing is useless, nothing without a reason, nothing superfluous, so that no art can imitate the cunning of nature's handiwork?' (1.33.92). What need, we might equally ask, has Otium of hands? The inspiration for this idea, whether due to Mantegna himself or to the deviser(s) of the invenzione, may well have been those passages in Pro verbs where the slothful man is described as always having his hands in his 158 Gombrich, 'The Sala dei Venti in the Palazzo del Te',/ Warburg C, 13 (1950), repr. in, and quoted from, Symbolic Images.

At all events, the famous texts praising the human hand, from Aristotle to Lactantius, were known and echoed in the Renaissance. Para celsus warned the physician to 'take good care of his hand . . . for in it he possesses the noblest and most precious object, most prized by the Creator'.159 In Rembrandt's Anatomy of Dr. Tulp, it has been argued, the fact that the dissection has reached the hand is sign of the supremacy of this bodily part.160 Giordano Bruno's Lo spaccio de la bestia trionfante (1584)161 also presents the hand as crucial to human activity, and the divine plan. In several dialogues Otium appears as an allegorical character, opposed to Fatica and Industria. Thanks to their absence Ocio and Sogno are able to appear at the court of Jove, 'solo in virtù privativa, che consiste nell'absenza de la lor opposita e nemica' (G 725; I 200). Ocio speaks at length in her own praise, claiming to have caused the Golden Age celebrated by Ovid and Tasso (G 726-30; I 200-4). Jove, however, rejects her case by invoking the divine purpose in creating the human hand (an argument which also recalls Renaissance treatises on the dignity of man): E soggionse che gli dei aveano donato a l'uomo l'intelletto e Ii mani, e l'aveano fatto simile a loro, donandogli facultà sopra gli altri animali; la quai consiste non solo in poter operar secondo la natura ed ordinario, ma, ed oltre, fuor le leggi di quella; acciö, formando o possendo formar altre nature, altri corsi, altri ordini con l'ingegno, con quella libertade, senza la quale non arebbe detta similitudine, venesse ad serbarsi dio de la terra. Quella certo, quando verrà ad essere ociosa, sarà frustratoria e vana, come indarno è l'occhio che non vede, e mano che non apprende. E per questo ha determinato la providenza, che vegna occupato ne l'a zione per le mani, e contemplazione per l'intelletto; de maniera che non contemple senza azione, e non opre senza contemplazione. Ne l'età dunque de l'oro per l'Ocio gli uomini non erano più virtuosi che sin al présente le bestie son virtuose, e forse erano più stupidi che moite di queste. (G 732-3; I 205) Unmoved by a sophistic speech from Momus on behalf of Ocio (G 738 45; I 209-13), Jove concludes the debate by conceding a place only to a 'lodevole e studioso Ocio', who may sit on the same throne with Sollecitu dine, 'per ciö che la fatica deve maneggiarsi per l'ocio, e l'ocio deve con temperarsi per la fatica'. But Jove rejects absolutely 'l'ocio vile e inerte' (G 745; I 213-14), and Sofia adds her warning against 'Ocio inerte, dis utile e pernicioso' (G 747; I 215). 159 Paracelsus, Selected Writings, ed.

The hand and its gestures obviously played a central role in classical rhetoric, with its teachings on actio (or pronuntiatio), rhetorical gesture. Quintilian wrote that As for the hands, without which all action would be crippled and en feebled, it is scarcely possible to describe the variety of their motions, since they are almost as expressive as words . . . Do we not use them to demand, promise, summon, dismiss, threaten, supplicate, express aver sion or fear, question or deny? Do we not employ them to indicate joy, sorrow, hesitation, confession, penitence, measure, quantity, number and time? Have they not power to excite and prohibit, to express ap proval, wonder or shame?162 It follows that anyone not wishing to use this 'universal language of the hands' may be opting out of communication, and therefore society. A later rhetoric book that makes this point explicit, while displaying the continuity of classical and biblical disapproval of otium, is Chirologia: or the Naturall Language of the Hand (1644), a manual on actio by the English writer John Bulwer.163 Making the traditional movement from rhetoric to real life and back, Bulwer reviews various manual postures and gestures, including 'Otio indulgeo' (fig. 5), that negation of action or communication which he vehemently attacks: To fold the hands is a gesture of idleness, an expression often seen in the hands of lazy lubbers amused with sloth who keep their dull hands so knit together to maintain a drowsy league with sleep. For being loath to forego the pleasure of ease, they by this gesture do, as it were, allure and play the bawds to indulge and procure their lust's delight more sweetly to cease upon their lither bodies, (pp. 37-8) Drawing on Valeriano's Ieroglifici,164 Bulwer refers to Egyptian priests who, to attack laziness, 'use to decipher a dull slow worm of this lousy tribe with his hands thus interlaced as parallels in his bosom, as if they . . . did lie sulking to avoid work' (p. 38). Turning to the Bible, Bulwer comments that this gesture of the hands 'is significantly brought out in sacred wit by a metaphor to upbraid and note out the despicable state of fools and sluggards, time-spending loiterers of no esteem, since the wisdom of man doth much consist in his hands'. The texts in Proverbs (19.24; 26.15), in which Solomon describes 'the nature of a slothful person who FOLDETH UP HIS HANDS (each hand 162 Institutio oratoria, xi.iii.86—7; trans. H. E.

Bulwer's indignation is representative of the continuing distrust of otium as a word or idea. By using personification an author could bring out its disreputable associations. In the Apologi, a collection of one hun dred moral fables by Bartolomeo Scala (1427-97), Florentine magnate and Chancellor, which provided Beroldo with the programme of the archi tectural reliefs he designed for the Palazzo Scala (built for Bartolomeo), A mor is found guilty by a tribunal hearing a case brought by a young man suffering the pangs of love. The judges summon up Negotium and pro nounce sentence: 'Go, Business, and bind Cupid's hands. Take the boy's wings away, break his arrows and quiver, and beat him till he faints. When he has thus been finally despoiled of his arms, send him out into the waste [in otiosas terras] to live out his life ingloriously . . . ' And from that day to this Cupid and Business have hated each other and never lived under the same roof. That is, in effect, the lesson of Ovid's Ars amatoria and Remedia amoris, put into action by Mantegna. In another apologue Scala allegorizes Negle gentia, who marries sleep and brings forth 'a swarm of children', including Otium, Desidia, Oscitatio, Inertia, Ieiunio, Carcere, Ignavia and Des perado. 165 But the allegory merely achieves what a dictionary or florilegium would set out in literal terms. In the Polyanthea of D. Nannius Mirabel lius, in its umpteenth expansion (1628), the cross-references under Acedia are 'Desidia, Ignavia, Otium, Otiositas, Pigritia', while the entry for Otium repeats these, adding 'vide Laboris, Molestiae'.166 V If we turn to imaginative literature in the sixteenth and seventeenth cen turies we find that otium continues to have preponderantly negative asso ciations. A recurring episode in Renaissance epic and romance, borrowed from classical epic, describes a hero putting aside his proper masculine pursuit of the vita activa, with its rewards of fame and glory, abandoning himself to a life of ease and sensual indulgence from which he has to be rescued by a messenger sent from heaven,167 or by the good offices of a 165 See Alessandro Parronchi, 'The language of humanism and the language of sculpture.

Greene states that his study of this recurring episode is intended to illuminate</page><page sequence="29">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 135 comrade or friend. The dalliance of Aeneas with Dido, and his conse quent 'rescue' by Mercury (Aeneid, 4.170-347), formed the basis for Ariosto's story, in the sixth and seventh cantos of Orlando Furioso, of how Ruggiero was seduced by the evil witch Alcina.168 Searching for the kingdom of Logostilla, or reason, who governs the seven virtues, he is attacked by a band of misshapen animals, representing the seven deadly sins, led by a fat drunken man sitting on a tortoise: none other than TOzio', source of all sin (6.63). Ruggiero defeats these obvious enemies but falls prey to the good-seeming maidens, Beltà and Leggiadria, who lead him to Alcina's palace, a true locus voluptatis. In this Epicure's paradise Ruggiero is overwhelmed by Alcina's beauty (7.10-16), and enjoys a prolonged bout of physical love (7.21-32). At this point Ariosto leaves him basking 'in every sort of pleasure, while toil was the lot' of his comrades in arms, and gives us a devastating onlooker's view of Ruggiero (in the words of the good witch, Melissa), who ben sapea che stava in giuco e in ballo e in cibo e in ozio molle e delicato, né più memoria avea del suo signore, né de la donna sua, né del suo onore. (7.40) As Harington's Elizabethan English renders it: 'Esteeming less his honour than his ease, / A few yeares life than everlasting fame'.169 Melissa rescues him from 'sustained idleness' (lunga inerzia), from this 'soft, womanly realm' (del regno effeminato e molle: 7.48), a synonymous coupling which shows that mollis has lost none of the pejorative associations it enjoyed from Cicero to Petrarch. The opposition between virtue and pleasure, frequent in Ariosto, forms the centre of Tasso's parallel seduction-plot, in which Rinaldo falls into the traps of the sorceress Armida.170 Armida's palace is surrounded by an artificial ver perpetuum where she leads her 'molle amorosa vita' (14.70-1). Rinaldo, already 'enwrapt in fond desire / ... in love and loosenesse idle' sits (14.7: e vaneggia ne l'ozio e ne l'amore), and when we see him in Armida's palace the Christian champion has succumbed to 'idleness, love, fancy, folly light': Quivi fra cibi ed ozio e Scherzi e foie torpi il campion de la cristiana fede. (15.44) the epic as a genre, but the detailed studies do not add up to a whole, and the evaluation of Ariosto as a glib, unserious writer is especially disappointing. 168 I quote from Ariosto, Opere, ed.

Ubaldo rebukes Rinaldo for being 'fuora / del mondo, in ozio . . . egregio campion d'una fan ciulla' ('buried in sloth and shame', as Fairfax renders with relish, 'A carpet champion for a wanton dame!': 16.32). Rinaldo is properly humiliated, 'Confused, speechless, senseless, ill, ashamed', and returns chastened to the vita activa. The ubiquity of otium as the great danger to the chivalric hero is seen from minor Italian epics of the Renaissance, such as Girardi's Ercole, in which the god Sogno has about him an alle gorical court where Pigritia and Otio have pre-eminence, or Bolognetti's II Costante (1565), in which the court of Venus includes Ozio, Piacere and Diletto, on her right hand, and on her left Querele, Timoré, Sospetto and Gelosia."1 In the English epic the same situation, and the same vocabulary, recur.172 Spenser's pageant of the Seven Deadly Sins is led by Sloth: Of which the first, that all the rest did guyde, Was sluggish Idleness the nourse of sin; Upon a slothfull Asse he chose to ryde. (i.iv. 18) He has 'little care' for devotion, or indeed anything else that would in volve exertion: 'From worldly cares himselfe he did esloyne, / And greatly shunned manly exercise' (20). If sloth is an obvious antithesis to heroic virtue, a more subtle adversary is Despair, who tempts Red Cross Knight to follow the example of one who has just committed suicide: is it unjust, he asks, to 'let him die at ease, that liveth here uneath' [l.ix.38: in unease]. Yet every Renaissance Christian knew that 'ease' was only pro mised in heaven, as a reward for good deeds on earth, while suicide meant damnation. But Despair continues to press Red Cross with his seductive otium (more tempting and insidious as the English 'ease', Spenser using related rhyme-words to draw out the sound narcotically). The suicide has finished 'the weary wandring way' of life (39), and in death does now enjoy eternall rest And happie ease, which thou doest want and crave. . . Is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease, And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet grave? Sleepe after toyle, port after stormie seas, Ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.

Hamilton's one-volume 'variorum' Faerie Queene (London, 1977), with useful annotation.</page><page sequence="31">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 137 Spenser's equation of otium with death, made by the triple repetition of 'ease' in that stanza, is the logical extension of the enervating and paralys ing effects traditionally attributed to idleness. Rescued by Una, Red Cross later shows that he has learned his lesson, how this life must be dedicated to virtue and heroic exertion: 'Of ease or rest I may not yet devize' (l.xii.18). The heroic ethic, setting virtus above voluptas, was not confined to the epic. In Machiavelli's historical writings, for instance, virtu is seen as leading to gloria, both military and political, while otium leads to disgrace.173 Machiavelli's interpretation of classical and contemporary history, indeed of all social and political life, is premissed - just like Sallust or Livy, we might say, were not the sentiments so widely held in the moral tradition - on the destructive effects of idleness, and the dangers of peace. In the Discorsi he writes that when 'the aim of Rome was empire and glory, and not repose' (II, ix; p. 307) it prospered, but when the 'Emperors began to be corrupted, preferring the shade of the palace to the sun of the camp', it began to decline (II, xxx; p. 368). The opposition sun/shade (equivalent to activity/idleness), deriving from the Roman rhetoric schools, continues to carry meaning. As for otium, the recent study by Sebastian de Grazia174 has brought out how often Machiavelli treats it as 'a pivotal term in the vertical alternation of the af fairs of men'. Book five of the Florentine History presents a general theory of instability in human affairs, a cyclic view of history that owes some thing to Polybius: All Countries in their alterations, doo most commonly chaunge from order to disorder, and from disorder to order againe. For nature hav ing made all worldly thinges variable, so soone as they have atteined their uttermost perfection and height, doo of force descend. . . . Warre begetteth quiet, quiet occasioneth idlenesse, Idlenesse breedeth disorder, Disorder maketh ruine: Likewise of ruine groweth order, of order vertue, and of vertue, glorie with good fortune. (V, i; p. Ill) Given this cyclic concept, one might object, otium would be a necessary stage in the rise and fall of nations. But to Machiavelli it remains a threat, and he even includes Cicero's otium honestum - that stock justification of the pursuit of letters - under the condemnation, declaring with all seriousness that 'the courage of warlike mindes cannot with a more honest idlenesse than the Studie of Letters be corrupted; nor idlenesse by anie greater or more perilous craft enter Cities well governed'. Indeed, he goes so far as to suggest that Cato's expulsion of the Greek philosophers 173 See Russell Price, 'The theme of gloria in Machiavelli', Renaiss Q, 30 (1977), 588-631, at 606-9.

If Machiavelli can heap such scorn on otium honestum, then the un adorned state of idleness, lacking any redeeming features, is invariably denounced. In Book one of his History he writes that the Florentine nobility having been largely destroyed by civil wars, its commonwealth was governed by 'those that had bene brought up in marchandise', and military affairs were left to 'the poore Princes, &amp; Gentlemen that wanted [a] living', who were 'not moved by any desire of glorie, but rather' the wish for riches and security. His history, he warns us, 'shall at large en treate ... of these idle Princes, and of these most base and cowardlie souldiers' (I, xxxix; p. 26). In Florence in 1466, during the dispute between Piero de' Medici and the Acciaiuoli, those citizens who were disturbed by civil disorder decided to assaie, if by some new found mirth or feast, the mindes of men might be setled. For most commonly the idle people be instruments for those that desire alteration. Then to remove this idlenesse, and give some occasion to alienate the minds of men from consideration of the state, civic festivals were put on (VII, xii; p. 178). If that fear of otium en couraging political disorder recalls Livy, so does Machiavelli's later ac count of the unhappy aftermath of quelling a rebellion. The citizens of Florence 'returned to their wonted order of life', hoping to enjoy political stability, but there followed 'those inconveniences which many times be ingendred by peace, for the youth became more prodigall than they were wont, spending their money in apparrell, feasting, and other like vanities, and (being idle) consumed their substance in play, and women' (VII, xxviii; p. 188). They were corrupted even further by a visit from the Duke of Milan, who turned Lent into carnival, leading the city even further towards 'customs contrarie to all well ordered civilitie' (p. 169). Machiavelli takes over not only the attitudes of Roman moralists but also their vocabulary. In Dell'arte della guerra he writes that, 'before they felt the blows of the ultramontane wars, our Italian rulers believed that it was enough for a prince to . . . adorn himself with gems and gold, . . . live very indolently [marcirsi nello ozio], . . . scorn anyone who tried to show them some praiseworthy path"75 - that is, one involving virtue. The verb marcescere, as we have seen, was first used by Livy. In The Prince Machiavelli warns that the wise ruler should 'never remain idle in peaceful times, but industriously make good use of them' (ch. xiv; p. 53), and tells those Italian rulers who have lost their states to lament not their bad luck but 'their own indolence' (ch. xxiv; p. 90) - ignavia as a synonym for otium going back to Plautus at least.

In the Discorsi Machiavelli declares summarily at one point that 'in well-regulated republics the state ought to be rich and the citizens poor' (I, xxxvii; pp. 208-9), returning to this view later, and actually recommending that citizens should be kept 'poor, so that their wealth and lack of virtue may neither corrupt themselves nor enable them to corrupt others' (ill, xvi; p. 463). The argument is given a historical context shortly afterwards, in a chapter discussing 'the poverty of Cincinnatus, and that of many other Roman citizens' (ill, xxv; pp. 486 8). The example of Cincinnatus, who was called from his little farm to gather an army and crush Rome's enemy, was 'celebrated by Titus Livius in the following golden words: "After this let men not listen to those who prefer riches to everything else in this world, and who think that there is neither honour nor virtue where wealth does not flow" ' (p. 486; Livy, III, 26). Characteristically forcing the terms into an antithesis, Machiavelli asserts that 'poverty produces better fruits than riches - that the first has conferred honour upon cities, countries, and religions, whilst the latter have only served to ruin them' (p. 488). Certainly, otium and its atten dant dangers cannot flourish without a surplus of time and money. This position in the Discorsi may shed some light on a puzzling passage in a dialogue by Luigi Guicciardini, brother to the famous historian, which has survived in a fragmentary state in the Biblioteca Nazionale, Florence. Felix Gilbert, who first traced the dialogue, noted that Luigi, writing to his brother Francesco in 1533, said that he had just completed a dialogue in which the interlocutors included Machiavelli.176 Since one of the speakers in the surviving fragment, 'De libera arbitrio dell'huomo', is called Niccolô, Gilbert argued that this represents Machiavelli, even though 'Niccolö's utterances in this dialogue do not by any means reproduce Machiavelli's opinions on the subjects discussed, as we know them from his writings' (pp. 164-5). In a passage not discussed by Gilbert,177 Girolamo - echoing Cato (above, p. 7) - argues that the ruler of a state must oppose with the severest laws any condition that could introduce 'la luxuria, la superbia, la ignavia, &amp; l'otio, maxime per essere questo el padre di tutti e vitii et primo &amp; potentissimo principio d'ogni ruina &amp; d'ogni destructione . . .' He should do this by maintaining in his republic 'la poverta honorata &amp; stimata quanto qualunque altra virtu . . .' These are precisely the policies recommended by Machiavelli in his Discorsi, yet the Niccolo of this dialogue expresses surprise at hearing Girolamo 'tanto lodare &amp; exaltare la poverta &amp; tanto damnare &amp; infamare quanto con breve parole facto havete l'otio', since he cannot see why the one should 176 'Machiavelli in an unknown contemporary dialogue', / Warburg C, 1 (1937-8), 163-6. 177 I am most grateful to Dr Alison Brown, of the Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, for providing me with this excerpt from her own transcription of the manuscript, Magi, vm, 1422, fols 67r-68v.</page><page sequence="34">140 Brian Vickers produce virtue, the other vice. After all, everyone works and strives in order to escape from poverty, just as in this short life they would like to enjoy the repose which Girolamo descibes as 'otio'. Girolamo's reply is to equate Niccolö with those who praise 'le richezze &amp; lo Otio', so encouraging 'nostri corropti costumi' in behaving like beasts, motivated 'più dalla cupidità &amp; forza de sensi che dalle honeste &amp; iuste voglie della ragione'. Warming to the task, he reiterates his thesis: Sia certo Niccolo la poverta essere madre d'ogni virtu, per nascere sem pre da lei la industria, &amp; da quella ancora quando è con buono ordine moderata le laudate opere, da le quali di poi ne risulta facilmente la grandeza dico con la felice, honesta &amp; honorata sicurta. Et quando tanto laudata quiete per troppo sicuro et abbondante vivere si converte finalmente in otio, subito si scuopre la ambitione la superbia, la dis cordia, la guerra, la crudelta insieme con altri peximi mali, e quali in brevissimo tempo causono la desolatione di tutti colore che nello ignavio et delitioso otio si trovono sommersi. This tendency to make otiurn the radix malorum is characteristic of Machiavelli in his whole treatment of this vice, as de Grazia has shown.178 To the question why, therefore, Luigi Guicciardini should attribute the opposite point of view to the Niccolö of this dialogue - who remains un satisfied with this account of poverty as 'the mother of the virtues' (perhaps another candidate for this role in Mantegna's painting!) - two answers seem possible. One is that this Niccolö is not to be identified with Machiavelli. The other, and more probable one, I feel, is that we have here another example of that trick in Renaissance dialogues of making well-known proponents of a particular viewpoint argue the opposite case, just as they might have had to do in a real-life disputation (as at a univer sity examination). So in the Disputationes Camaldulenses Landino makes the young Lorenzo the Magnificent (poet of retirement and solitude) de fend civic wisdom, 'while the new exaltation of contemplation is cham pioned by the most articulate and civic-minded of the older burgher aristocracy, Alberti'.179 In Poggio's De avaritia the interlocutors who at tack and defend avarice are deliberately chosen so that their characters belie their espoused views,180 while in Valla's De voluptate the separation between the persona and his argument is frequently insisted on.181 We may well find the second possibility more convincing, but either way Luigi Guicciardini's diatribe against otium drew on a long and vigorous tradition. 178 Machiavelli in Hell, 243, 263. 179 E.

Shakespeare's understanding of the opposi tion between ozio or ignavia and virtii is as sharp as Machiavelli's, and historically accurate. Antony, in his Roman mood, wants to free himself and his virtue from Cleopatra: These strong Egyptian fetters I must break, Or lose myself in dotage. . . . I must from this enchanting queen break off; Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know, My idleness doth hatch. 'Dotage' is doubly appropriate, the folly of old age linked with that of ex cessive love. He mocks Cleopatra as a queen ruling over otium - which would put her, in Renaissance thought, high among the vices: But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject, I should take you For idleness itself. Her reply is to sophistically invert the contrast between otium and labor, dismissing his concern: "Tis sweating labour / To bear such idleness so near the heart. . . .'182 Yet Antony's failure to resolve the tension between those two opposed ways of life leads to his, and her ruin. Many characters in Shakespeare express a truly Roman detestation of otium. John of Gaunt's dying speech denounces 'they whom youth and ease have taught to glose' - to talk or think superficially (Richard II, 2.1.10). Salisbury, outraged at the murder of young Arthur, vows to reject all pleasures, not to know 'ease and idleness' until he can revenge it (KingJohn, 4.3.67ff). Bedford's recoil on himself, disgusted at 'living idly here in pomp and ease' (1 Henry VI, 1.1.142), resembles that of Catullus or Ben Jonson, while Suffolk's resolve to 'scour ... a vengeful sword, rusted with ease' (2 Henry VI, 3.2.198), recalls Cato. The fruitlessness of otium, its tendency to luxuriate in idle foliage or weeds, lies behind both Burgundy's descrip tion of the barren and chaotic state of war-torn France, which 'Conceives by idleness and nothing teems / But hateful docks' (Henry V, 5.2.51), and the Ghost of Hamlet's father, approving his son's virtù in wanting revenge: 182 Antony and Cleopatra, 1.2.116ff, 128ff; 1.3.92ff. A concordance to Shakespeare will show how completely he has taken over the traditional associations of idleness with uselessness, shape lessness, disorder, sterility, truancy, parasitism, insubstantiality and waste.</page><page sequence="36">142 Brian Vickers And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. (Hamlet, 1.5.32ff) Men, like crops, may be 'sterile with idleness or manured with industry' (Othello, 1.3.328). One remedy for the otiose, as ever, is war: so the French youth, 'that surfeit on their ease', will join the Florentine wars 'for physic' (All's Well, 3.1.17ff). For Shakespeare as for the Roman and medieval moralists, a stagnant pool summed up the evils of inactivity.183 Shakespeare's great contemporary, Francis Bacon, absorbed the same ethos. His father, Sir Nicholas Bacon, had the long gallery of his mansion at Gorhambury adorned with a collection of sententiae (now preserved in a British Library manuscript) from classical sources, chiefly Cicero's De officiis and Seneca's Epistulae morales. From the latter come two of the quotations 'De Otio', the admonition 'Otii vitia, negotio discute' (Ep., 56.9): 'Shake off the defects of leisure by work', and 'Gloriari otio, mera ambitio est' (68.3): 'To brag about your leisure is nothing but affecta tion.' More remarkable is the third quotation, 'Otio qui nescit uti / Plus negotii habet quam cum est negotium in negotio' ('He who does not know how to use his leisure is busier than when he is busy with his business'), which comes from what we have seen to be the very first locus classions for otium in Latin literature, the soldiers' chorus from Ennius' Iphigenia, as recorded by Aulus Gellius.184 Francis Bacon's involvement with the vita activa was total, indeed he played a major role in using its values to legitimize the role of science in working pro bono publico. So he wrote to Isaac Casaubon, probably in 1609, that 'to write at leisure that which is to be read at leisure [per otium scribi quae per otium legantur] matters little; but to bring about the better ordering of man's life and business, with all its troubles and difficulties, by the help of sound and true con templations, - this is the thing I am at."85 From this position in his 183 Thus the villain Sebastian, the would-be murderer of Prospero, says 'I am standing water' - the source of all vices (The Tempest, 2.1.216ff). In his New Arden edition of the play Frank Kermode sees 'a reference, perhaps, to the proverb Vitium capiunt, nimoveantur aquae'. See also M. S. Luria, 'Standing water and sloth in The Tempest', Eng Stud, 49 (1968), 328-31. There is a standing pool in Gerusalemme Liberata, 10.61 (and 7.28.5ff), and a floating island in an 'Idle Lake in The Faerie Queene, n.vi. 10, which a seventeenth-century reader likened to the 'dead sea of pleasure'. 184 Sir Nicholas Bacon's Great House Sententiae, ed. and trans.

Spedding; further references to this edition are included in the text. This letter to Casaubon picks up a phrase Bacon had used in the Advancement of Learning (1605), where he described his purpose as being 'in good earnest not to write at leisure that which men may read at leisure, but really to instruct and suborn action and active life' (in, 419). In his essay 'Of the True Greatness of Kingdoms and Estates' he repeats the ancient Roman idea that 'to a kingdom or estate a just and honourable war is the true exercise', vital to health, 'for in a slothful peace both courages will effeminate and manners corrupt' (vi, 450). On Bacon's appropriation of the vita activa tradition for science see Brian Vickers, 'Bacon's so-called "Utilitarianism": sources and influence', in Francis Bacon.

Fattori (Rome, 1984), 281-313.</page><page sequence="37">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 143 scientific works he expressed nothing but scorn for the occult arts, which thought that they could achieve great works without great labour. So in the Novum Organum he attacked 'the students of natural magic' for their 'idle and most slothful conjectures' {ex conjecturis otiosis et supinissimis) concerning sympathies and antipathies. At the end of that book he could mark a degree of scientific progress, in that creation 'is now by various labours - not certainly by disputations or idle magical ceremonies [per otiosas ceremonias magicas] ... - at length and in some measure sub dued to . . . the uses of human life' {Works, 4.84, 248). In his last years, after his shameful fall, dismissed from the public and active life, Bacon devoted all his energies to realizing his scientific projects. In a letter of 1622 he wryly compared his own state with Cicero's ideal of otium cum dignitate: I find in books . . . that it is accounted a great bliss for a man to have Leisure with Honour. That was never my fortune; nor is. For time was, I had Honour without Leisure; and now I have Leisure without Honour. . . . But my desire is now to have Leisure without Loitering, and not to become an abbey-lubber, as the old proverb was, but to yield some fruit of my private life. (XIV, 364-5) Whether the occultists' spurious goal of knowledge without work, or the monasteries' dedication to the contemplative life remote from the public world (a common target in post-Reformation England), Bacon stigmatized any state based on otium as useless, unproductive. Other proponents of the scientific revolution shared this disgust at idleness, indeed it affected their whole cosmogony. Historians of science do not seem to have realized that the widespread distrust of otium, and the negative associations of idleness and inertia as being contrary to God's commandment for fallen man - 'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread' (Gen. 3.19) - created a dilemma for natural philosophers in the Renaissance. While the mathematicization of nature could be applied to the movement of the planets or the circulation of the blood without dif ficulty, a purely scientific explanation of the earth in terms of 'inert mat ter' would seem to make one part of God's purpose in the Creation reject another. For this reason natural philosophers argued that since it would be scandalous to conceive of the earth as idle it must contain some active principle. Bernard de Palissy, in his Recepte véritable par laquelle tous les hommes de la France pourront apprendre à multiplier et augmenter leurs trésors (La Rochelle, 1563), alludes to Psalm 104 and to the account of creation in Genesis, and then adds: mais pourtant, Dieu ne créa pas ces choses pour les laisser oisifves, ains chacune fait son devoir, selon le commandement qui luy est donné de Dieu. Les astres et planetes ne sont pas oisifves, la mer se pourmeine d'un costé et d'autre, et se travaille à produire choses profitables, la terre semblablement n'est jamais oisifve: ce qui se</page><page sequence="38">144 Brian Vickers consomme naturellement en elle, elle le renouvelle et le reforme de rechef. . . ,186 In the following century the Cartesian reduction of nature to matter and motion aroused similar objections.187 Walter Charleton, in an early essay in natural theology, The darkness of atheism dispelled by the light of nature (1652), attacked Descartes and others who believed that matter is 'absolutely idle, and devoid of all motive or active virtue'. Sir Matthew Hale, in his Observations touching the principles of natural motions (1677), argued that there must be some third kind of 'Entity' besides matter and motion, 'far more noble' than these, 'which giveth Life, Vigor, Activity and Motion, immediately next under the Lord of Nature to every self-moving Being'. Hale called this entity vis, or virtus activa, 'without which, Matter would be stupid, dull, unactive, and always at rest in itself'. Here the negative associations otium, military and social ('noble' activity opposed to vil riposo), are rejected as unworthy of matter and of the God who created it. VII Any writer wishing to use otium in the seventeenth century in a positive sense, we may conclude, would have had to work hard to remove its pejorative meaning, or to cancel out its ambivalence into some innocuous synonym for quies. The degree to which the corrupting effects of idleness had become a commonplace can be seen from such sententious observa tions as these by Christopher Newstead (an Oxford divinity graduate) in 1620: 'Generosos animos Otium corrumpit. Want of imployment corrupts the bravest spirits; the fountain of their virtue corrupts by standing. Want of use causeth disabilitie; but custome, perfection.'188 Some writers managed to redeem the concept, at any rate notionally. In Timber; or Discoveries, his unpublished notebook, Ben Jonson entered the heading Otium, and wrote: 'Ease, and relaxation, are profitable to all studies. The mind is like a Bow, the stronger by being unbent. But the temper in Spirits is all, when to command a mans wit; when to favour it.' This humane observation is followed by an excerpt from the Elder Seneca's Controversiae concerning Porcius Lato, an extreme case of obsessive ap plication, who would work until he fainted, but then totally devote himself to 'all sports, and looseness againe; that it was almost a despaire to draw him to his booke: But once got to it, hee grew stronger, and more 186 Oeuvres completes de Bernard Palissy, ed.

In the English seventeenth century the normal word for this com plementary term would not be 'ease', but 'rest'. In Paradise Lost, as night falls in the Garden of Eden, Adam instructs his 'fair consort' that the hour Of night, and all things now retired to rest Mind us of like repose, since God hath set Labour and rest, as day and night to men Successive. . . . (IV, 61 Off) Even before the Fall, then, work and repose were the proper alternating states for mankind, the favour of God distinguishing us from the beasts: other creatures all day long Rove idle unemployed, and less need rest; Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed, which declares his dignity, And the regard of heaven on all his ways; While other animals unactive range, And of their doings God takes no account. (616ff) Although pre-Reformation commentators, in the Augustinian tradition, allowed prelapsarian Adam to enjoy the contemplative life, Protestant theologians declared it right that Adam 'should have exercised himselfe in some honest labour, even in Paradise', tending the garden.190 Yet mankind's legitimate 'rest' is differentiated from the animals'; 'idle unem ployed . . . unactive', both here and after the Fall, where Adam accepts God's curse that 'with labour I must earn / My bread' with the comment: 'what harm? Idleness had been worse' (X, 1053ff). Although perhaps given a Protestant emphasis, Milton's endorsement of the ethic forbidding idleness and recommending activity is one of many classical ideas absorbed by BenJ onsonas poet and dramatist. In the'Argu ment' to The Alchemist (1610) he writes of the servant Face, left alone and unoccupied by his master during the plague: 'Ease him corrupted.' In his collection of Epigrammes (1616) no.

(28-9) The greater bulk of Jonson's poetry comes within the category of epideic tic rhetoric, praising virtue and attacking vice. His poems reflect what he calls 'this strife / Of vice, and vertue; wherein all great life / Almost, is exercis'd' (Ep., CII; p. 48). So he praises noble men and women who were outstanding for virtue, such as Sir Horace Vere, Sir John Radcliffe and Sir Henrie Savile {Ep., XCI, XCIII, XCV), Lucy Countess of Bedford {Ep., LXXVl), Elizabeth Countess of Rutland and Katherine, Lady Aubigny {Forrest, XII, XIII). In Underwood (posthumously published in 1641) Jonson consciously places himself in the Roman tradition denouncing otium, most powerfully in 'An Epistle to a Friend, to Perswade him to the Warres' (17), with its vigorous opening: Wake, friend, from forth thy Lethargie: the Drum Beates brave and loude in Europe, and bids come All that dare rowse: or are not loth to quit Their vitious ease, and be o'rewhelm'd with it. It is a call to keepe the spirits alive That gaspe for action, and would yet revive Mans buried honour, in his sleepie life: Quickning dead Nature, to her noblest strife. (11. 1-8; p. 147) 1 his society, lost in its otiurn and inertia, has inevitably declined to the pursuit of voluptas: 'Our Delicacies are grown capitale' (fatal), justice and modesty have fled, 'Pleasures only sought!' (11. 37-41). All the vices have flourished in 'our ill-us'd freedome, and soft peace' (121 ff). - That sounds like the invenzione for another painting. Similarly in 'An Epigram. To our great and good K. Charles on his Anniversary Day 1629' (66), Jonson echoes Cicero: O Times! O Manners! Surfet bred of ease, The Truly Epidemical disease! (p. 218) Yet not only society at large suffers from the dangers of otium. In 'An Ode. To Himselfe' (25) Jonson delivers a biting self-reproach: Where do'st thou carelesse lie Buried in ease and sloth? Knowledge that sleeps, doth die; And this Securitie, It is the common Moath, That eats on wits, and Arts, and destroyes them both. (p. 159) If otium and securitas are the natural enemies of scientia and poetria, the remedy is, once again, 'vertue' (11. 15-17). In some contexts otium could be reclaimed from its negative connota tions. Mildmay Fane, in his collection of religious poems, Otia Sacra</page><page sequence="41">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 147 (1644),191 certainly kept to the favourable associations of poetry with the muses, and of retirement with the Christian contemplative life (an equa tion much abused by proponents of idleness). But the solitude and privacy that Fane celebrates are states which give opportunity for self-examina tion, reflection, amendment and thanksgiving. Divine love accompanies contempt of worldly values, and words such as 'ease' or 'pleasure' are con spicuous by their absence. Other writers used otia as a synonym for poetry, the 'fruits of leisure': that is, leisure having a useful product. Con stantin Huygens, father of the mathematician, called the poems which he wrote in the intervals of a demanding political career Otia.'92 It may well be that the association of otium with the writing of lyric poetry is a new development in the mid-seventeenth century, a 'baroque' phenom enon rather than a Renaissance one. Yet we should guard against assum ing that any universally favourable version of otium prevailed. In moral philosophy, especially in the controversies surrounding Epicurus in the seventeenth century and after, it is noticeable how much pejorative force still attaches to the word 'ease'.193 Milton described with some contempt the Epicureans' notion of felicity as 'corporal pleasure . . . and careless ease' ('Paradise Regained, 1671, 4.298ff); Walter Charleton referred to the Epicureans' supreme 'Good of ease and quiet', the 'Summum Bonum of man's life, which is Pleasure, consisting in the Indolency of the Body, and Tranquillity of the Mind'; Thomas Creech attacked their hedonism ('Pleasures, such often as a Beast would disdain'), . . . their atheism ('Ease is the study of the Atheist'), and their conception of the gods as being in different to human affairs (how can they be human 'when "being supinely idle and at ease" they have no functions to be performed by eyes, hands, and feet? For members, Creech says, arise from function'); and Richard Bentley found the Epicurean gods 'despicable beings, "dissolved in laziness and ease'".194 If we remind ourselves that education at school and university through out the seventeenth century was solidly based on the classics, with Cicero, Seneca, Horace, Livy and Tacitus figuring large in the curriculum, we 191 Mildmay Fane, Otia Sacra (London, 1644); facs. ed. D. M. Friedman (Delmar, NY, 1975). Although belonging to the genre of Christian emblematic poetry, many poems in this collection are concerned with the individual's reciprocal duties to man and God. Annabel Patterson (Marvell and the Civic Crown, Princeton, NJ, 1978, p. 107) has also noted that Fane's work 'contains a perfect definition of the Protestant man of letters and conscience', bent on the contemplation of nature as a means of approaching God. 192 I owe this information to Professor Leonard Forster. See also Henry Birkhead, Otium Lit teratum (Oxford, 1658). 193 The fullest survey of this topic is still, unfortunately, T. F. Mayo, Epicurus in England (1650 1725), a Columbia University dissertation (New York, 1934) which gives an extremely superficial account. Translators and commentators on Epicurus in this period are said to be 'admirers' or 'defenders' of him, even though they explicitly attack and disown his atheism and hedonism. 194 See Mayo, 31, 38-9, 63, 66, 193. Creech's comment on the absurdity of Epicurus' gods having human members but never using them derives from Cicero, De nat. deor., 1.33.92, cited above in discussing Mantegna.</page><page sequence="42">148 Brian Vickers can legitimately infer that Roman values helped to shape the prototype of the English gentleman, whatever his political or religious convictions. This obvious point was ignored by Maren-Sofie Rpstvig, in her pioneering and learned account of seventeenth-century poetry of retirement, which she divided up neatly but unhistorically into three chronological phases, Stoic, Neo-Platonic and 'innocent Epicurean'.195 While there were indeed many poems, and some anthologies, 'in praise of the country life', they fell into the long-standing philosophical-rhetorical tradition (initiated, for post-Renaissance Europe, by Petrarch) juxtaposing town and country, society against solitude, the active and contemplative lives. This was above all a tradition of debate, in which celebration of one side of the case was often followed by its denigration and the counter-praise of the other, sometimes even by the same writer. Everyone knew the topoi that could be marshalled for each side, and some clever men even argued the case foreign to their actual beliefs. So in 1665 George Mackenzie, a distinguished Scottish lawyer, published A Moral Essay, Preferring Solitude to Publick Employment, in which he denigrated the vita activa which he himself led. Two years later John Evelyn, proponent of gardens and retirement, rose to the bait with Publick Employment and an Active Life Prefer'd to Solitude.'96 This exchange echoes the ironic reversal of roles in debate that we have seen in Poggio, Landino, Valla, and perhaps Guicciardini. In this continuing tradition of educated debate writers were keenly aware of the implications of choosing one form of life or another. The irony of Horace's Second Epode, Beatus ille, being given to Alfinius, the usurer, would not have been lost on them. But one proponent of retire ment, Abraham Cowley, found the ironic framework unpleasing to his tastes, and simply omitted the last four lines from his translation. Rpstvig comments, somewhat misleadingly, that 'a classical scholar will know that the lines in praise of rural obscurity and simplicity are spoken by a usurer, and that Horace ends his poem' with a 'satirical conclusion' showing how 'the usurer's love of money' prevails. One would have to qualify that remark as regards the seventeenth century: it may be true that today only 'a classical scholar' will know this, but then every educated reader did. Rpstvig in effect endorses Cowley's excision, for she summarizes the poem as presenting simply 'Horace's Happy Man' with his love of country life, a topos which subsequently becomes a fixed point in her reading of English poetry - indeed she ceases to report whether later translations omitted the conclusion or not. Ben Jonson did not; nor did John Ashmore, despite his avowed preference for the country life; nor did John Dryden.197 195 Maren-Sofie R0stvig, The Happy Man.

Proponents of retirement could include him in their anthologies in praise of the country life (although it is noteworthy that the Odes that John Ashmore selected for translation in 1621 are mostly those in the moral tradition of 'being satisfied with little'). Proponents of action, however, could take Horace and turn him upside down. Thus the republi can Henry Marten, who had been closely associated with Cromwell's new republic, helping to devise its symbolism, was outraged when Cromwell dissolved the Long Parliament in 1653, and protested in an 'Antepod[um] Horatian[um]'. Marten takes the 'Beatus ille' poem and stands it on its head: Ignavus ille qui sepultus ocio Ut bruta gens animalium Materna bobus rura vexat pigrior, Inhians decuplo foenori Rostris ineptus, impar et se iudice Civis, cliensq[ue] civium. ('Cowardly, slothful is he who, buried in leisure, like the brute race of animals, more sluggish than his oxen, vexes his mother lands, gaping for tenfold increase, unfitted for the rostrum, even in his own judgement unequal to a citizen, and a dependent of citizens.') Marten, who called the poem 'vitae civicae laudes',198 is clearly protesting at the enforced idleness that Cromwell's un-republican act has thrust on those who wish ed to take part in public and parliamentary life. Otium still carries all its overtones of idleness and unmanly behaviour, as in Virgil's 'studiis ig nobilis oti', or Ariosto's 'vil riposo'. But of course he did not care, or dare to publish his protest. The epic tradition - Homer, Virgil, Ariosto, Tasso, Spenser - repre sented, to Renaissance and baroque readers and writers, the highest non dramatic literary genre, and in that tradition otium is unequivocally negative. The invitation to rest, to indulge the senses, is tantamount to suicide, as Spenser emphasized, and the locus amoenus is the scene for the most dangerous degradations of human potential, unless and until some paragon of virtue, divine or human, performs a rescue. This is the tradition still alive in Marvell's discursive poem 'Upon Appleton House',199 the seat of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who in June 1650 resigned his com mand of the parliamentary armies in protest against Cromwell's policies 198 I am grateful to David Norbrook and his stimulating paper, 'Is Marvell's "Horatian Ode" a Horatian Ode?', given at the International Society for the History of Rhetoric meeting in Oxford, 1985, for my knowledge of this poem and for permission to quote his text and translation.

(Edward Fairfax, whose translation of Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata appeared in 1600 and 1624, was a member of the same family.) Marvell spent some time between 1650 and 1651 at Nun-Appleton as tutor to Mary Fairfax, and in this long and at times whimsical poem (776 lines) he celebrates the house and its history. Fairfax, who chose honourable retirement rather than butchery, is a figure resembling Cato, or Scipio Africanus, as described by Cicero, and now updated by Marvell: Who, when retired here to Peace, His warlike Studie could not cease; But laid these Gardens out in sport In the just Figure of a Fort. . . . (283ff; p. 89) Marvell's wit does not exclude seriousness: the fort has 'five Bastions, . . . As Aiming one for ev'ry Sense' (287ff), traditional targets of moral diatribe since antiquity, and this image of Fairfax as reason or virtue attacking the passions and vices makes him a figure who, like Pallas, can save and regenerate. For he, . . . had it pleasèd him and God, Might once have made our Gardens spring Fresh as his own and flourishing. (346ff; p. 91) Denied access to public life, Fairfax - like Sallust - decided to 'Ambition weed, but Conscience till'. Into this garden of virtue, after a comical passage describing the meta morphoses in the estate caused by flooding, the poet inserts himself: But I, retiring from the Flood, Take sanctuary in the Wood . . . (481ff; p.96) The wood is thick, hostile to the intruder - 'Dark all without it knits; within / It opens passable and thin' (505ff; p. 97), offering the poet an apparent refuge in which he can indulge both body - 'Then as I careless on the Bed / Of gelid Strawberryes do tread' (529ff) - and mind, speculating on creation and corruption, the Fall and much else: 'Thus I, easie Philosopher / Among the Birds and Trees confer' (561 ff). 'Ease' is the standard translation for otium, and carries, in the epic and moral traditions, strong pejorative associations, while 'easie Philosopher' in evitably suggests Epicurus, whose doctrine of hedonism was universally despised (and, of course, misunderstood). The poet's self-portrait is tak ing on a critical tinge, becoming, as he relapses into sensuality, a still greater deterrent: Then, languishing with ease, I toss On Pallets swoln of Velvet Moss; While the Wind, cooling through the Boughs, Flatters with Air my panting Brows. (593ff; p. 100)</page><page sequence="45">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 151 The strongly sensuous language in the second line confirms that 'ease' here is 'vitious', as Jonson called it, negative otium, linked as it is with 'languishing', for the word languor has only pejorative overtones in Latin (recurring frequently in Roman diatribes against sensuality), or indeed in the modern languages.200 The poet's retirement, unlike Fairfax's, is volun tary, not enforced, but he manifests no guilt about it, instead imploring the plants to 'Bind' and 'Curie' about him, 'That I may never leave this Place' (609ff; p. 101). He gives himself entirely, soul and body, to fishing, which came under attack in the moralizing literature as an emblem of idleness,201 and he adopts the recumbent posture of the self-indulgent and unheroic man: Oh what a Pleasure 'tis to hedge My Temples here with heavy sedge; Abandoning my lazy Side, Stretcht as a Bank unto the Tide . . . (641ff; p. 102) Just at this point, when he seems lost to virtue, rescue arrives, not in the shape of Mercury or Ubaldo, but in that of the daughter of the house: But now away my Hooks, my Quills, And Angles, idle Utensils. The young Maria walks to night: Hide trifling Youth thy Pleasures slight. 'Twere shame that such judicious Eyes Should with such Toyes a Man surprize; She that already is the Law Of all her Sex, her Ages Aw. (649ff) The remaining fifteen stanzas are devoted to praising Maria Fairfax's vir tue, poetry taking on here the function that history had for Sallust in his enforced retirement, the celebration of good deeds to inspire others to emulation. To recall Cicero's formulation of this transformation from private to public life, cedat . . . forum castris, otium militiae, stilus gladio, umbra soli, and vice to virtue. The speaker of Marvell's 'The Garden' has seemingly put into practice his predecessor's wish to 'never leave this Place'. Safe in this 'best retreat', he amuses himself by disparaging all those engaged in public life who contend for 'the civic crown', whether athletes, soldiers or poets: 200 Cf. Cicero, Acad., 2.2.4: 'hebescere et languescere in otio', and De nat. deor., 1.4.7: 'Nam quum otio langueremus'; and André 1966, 245. In De officiis, 1.34.123, Cicero warns that old age must be on its guard above all 'against surrendering to feebleness and idleness' (quam ne languori se desidiaeque dedit). In the Metamorphoses Ovid depicts a terrible scene as the plague sent by Juno devastates Aegina: 'Omnia languor habet. . . ': 'Languor and lethargy! In woods, fields, roads / Foul corpses lie ... ' (vu, 547-8); trans. A. D. Melville (Oxford, 1986). It is with these connotations that Dante uses languir in Inferno, xxix.66: cf. Singleton's Commentary, ad loc. In Johannes Matthias Gesnerus' revision of the Stephanus Thesaurus (Leipzig, 1744) languor is defined as: 'Proprie est Defectus virium, et succi naturalis'. 201 See, e.g., S. Koslow, 'Frans Hals's "Fisherboys". Exemplars of idleness', Art Bull, 57 (1975), 418-32.</page><page sequence="46">152 Brian Vickers How vainly men themselves amaze To win the Palm, the Oke, or Bayes. (1-2; p. 51) This is to echo the repudiation of the civic life made by Ovid on behalf of otium and amor, and singled out by Petrarch as a dangerous act. Yet the curious feature of Marvell's speaker is that he despises love, and exalts, in stead, the luxuries of his garden. Where other Renaissance gardens were settings for work, cultivation of plants and cultivation of the self, the in habitant of this garden exults at not having to lift a finger: What wond'rous Life in this I lead! Ripe Apples drop about my head; The Luscious Clusters of the Vine Upon my Mouth do crush their Wine; The Nectaren, and curious Peach, Into my hands themselves do reach; Stumbling on Melons, as I pass, Insnar'd with Flow'rs, I fall on Grass. (33ff; p. 52) Readers familiar with all the biblical and moralizing texts denouncing the slothful for not even wanting to raise their hands to their mouths will note that this specimen of otiositas has found a prodigal setting, where the fruit itself does all the work, thrusting itself on the consumer, who seems at times overwhelmed. Yet, as many commentators have noticed, from the apples in the second line to the 'fall on Grass' at the end, this stanza is dominated by the transgression of Adam and Eve. The delicacy of Marvell's art relies on us noticing significances to which his persona is blind. Our speaker's enthusiasm for the place is so great that he begins to invest it with human attributes, disvaluing women in praise of trees. The trees are more beautiful, he argues, and it was solely for this reason that the gods pursued maidens, in order to metamorphose them into trees: Apollo hunted Daphne so, Only that She might Laurel grow. And Pan did after Syrinx speed, Not as a Nymph, but for a Reed. (29ff; p. 52) The specious arguments are amusing, but also ridiculous - intended to be seen as sophistic, like Ovid's argument that Aegisthus committed adultery because he was unoccupied. Marvell's speaker has taken on a rhetorical task that exceeds his powers. His preference for trees over women results in an implied criticism of God for having created Eve: 'And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him' (Gen. 2.18). But now: Such was that happy Garden-state While Man there walk'd without a Mate: After a Place so pure, and sweet, What other Help could yet be meet! (57ff; p. 53)</page><page sequence="47">Leisure and idleness: the ambivalence of otium 153 The past tense there shows that he writes, knowingly, after the Fall, thus it is futile to long for Adam's single life, which would have made him the one and only human figure in history, and so indeed the negation of his tory. And the inevitable consequence of the Fall was that man should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, so that it is disconcerting to find our apostle of retirement praising, in the last stanza, the 'skilful Gardner' for his creation (either God, who made all gardens; or the human crafts man who made this floral sundial), and celebrating, 'as it works, th'indus trious Bee' - without reflecting on his own idle unemployment. These are the last things that a competent praiser of retirement would invoke. The ambivalence of otium, exploited by Marvell as by Cicero and Sallust, Ovid and Catullus, allows a seventeenth-century poet to present his persona arguing eloquently and mellifluously for a way of life known to be wrong, leading as it does to inertia, sterility and death. This same doubleness, or perhaps innocence of the pejorative associations, has allowed a majority of twentieth-century critics and readers to see the 'Quiet' and 'Innocence' celebrated here in non-ironic, innocuous terms. It is time to consider the other side of the coin. The reader of Marvell's 'The Garden' has to play the part of Pallas, once more: reclaim virtue and overcome luxuria, superbia and otium. VIII This study of the negative connotations of otiurn may have wider significance. An essay in the history of ideas cannot, of course, supplant social history, but it can complement it - indeed history is inconceivable without philology. Historians cannot ignore semantic change, a constant factor in the development of any language, nor can they fail to investigate the meanings of concepts and ideas in a given period. As this survey demonstrates, the fear of idleness in Europe up to the eighteenth century was so strong that otium could only be accepted if strongly qualified as honestum, a leisure which yielded 'fruits' in works of literature, poetry, philosophy or history. The dominant ideology of work and employment was so strong that 'ease' could only be countenanced as an incidental phase of rest, in order for work to be resumed with renewed energy. In earlier times employers reserved the right (or at least, thought they did) to determine whether or not workers had any leisure, and how they spent it. When the Glasgow hammermen went on strike in the mid-eighteenth century in an effort to get shorter working hours, their employers rejected the demand because 'the leisure time thus created would be spent in the public house with a resulting loss of working efficiency'.202 Leisure as a valid state in itself, something that the citizen had earned, and was free to 202 Keith Thomas, 'Work and leisure in pre-industrial society', Past and Present, no. 29 (1964), 50-62, at 61.</page><page sequence="48">154 Brian Vickers dispose of as he chose, hardly existed before 1700. There were holidays and festivals, of course, carnivals and jollities, but these tended to be fixed by the church calendar, and were periods of a few days or at most weeks, marked off from the periods of work on either side. Leisure as a privilege that could be enjoyed daily, or whenever one pleased, is a concept (whether favourable or critical) that emerged only in the nineteenth century. The OED's first citation under 'leisured classes' is a reference to a 'leisur'd mortal' in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1794, which hardly carries the social connotations that we now give to the term. Its next quotation, from J. S. Mill's Political Economy (1848), refers to 'the services which a nation having leisured classes is entitled to expect from them' - where leisure is once again placed under the necessity to yield a fruitful return. The term itself has achieved most circulation thanks to the famous work of Thorstein Vehlen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), a work which, as Keith Thomas puts it, records 'the cor roding effects of an obsssion with leisure'.203 The work ethos survives, even in the bizarre form that we now call 'the leisure industry', and the emergence of professional organizations dedicated to leisure204 - too serious and profitable a business to be left to nature. Further development of these thoughts would take me beyond the bounds of this essay. But what is involved is a shift in attitudes which does not seem to have attracted much notice from historians, the move from those paired categories 'activity/inactivity', which correspond to the ab solute ethical dichotomy 'virtue/vice', to a new pair, 'work/leisure', both forms of virtue - or a least not denounced in advance as vicious. This shift took place in the nineteenth century, so far as one can tell. Perhaps the validation of leisure had something to do with the domestication of work as a matter-of-fact wage-earning process, lacking any moral connota tions, another stage in the 'disenchantment of the world'. If a worker's life is divided up into weeks per year, hours per day of paid labour, then he or she may gradually come to enjoy so many hours of leisure as earned time. Of course, the change in attitude was neither sudden nor total. But it did take place, and we now look at the past from the other side of a divide in which words like otium and quies seem deceptively innocent. Centre for Renaissance Studies, ETH Zürich 203 Ibid., 57. 204 In October the first meeting of the 'European Leisure Forum' took place in Zürich, modelled on the 'World Leisure and Recreation Association'. The speakers, including 'Leisure Consultants' and members of an 'Institut für Motivforschung', discussed such topics as 'New Strategies for Leisure Provision', 'Free Time is Stimulus Time: Maketing and Public Strategies in the Leisure Sector', while the accompanying brochure declared that 'Leisure is where work becomes creative'. The wheel has turned full circle: now work has been devalued, the very concept 'Freizeit' reducing it to the status of 'bound', 'imprisoned' time, or costly time.</page></plain_text>
