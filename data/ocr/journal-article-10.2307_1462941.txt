<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of the American Academy of Religion, L/4 Defining Nascent Ritual Ronald L. Grimes I n 1979 anthropologist Victor Turner reported on his collaboration with director and performance theorist Richard Schechner in designing exploratory workshops on selected Ndembu rites. Turner refers to such experiments as "ethnographic drama" (1979:91); Schechner, as "restored behavior" (1971:21). In 1980, after collaborating with anthropologist Colin Turnbull, director Peter Brook (1968) presented a repertoire of performances, including "The Conference of the Birds" and "The Ik." In addition, individual members of Brook's Le Centre International de Creations Theatrales performed "A Dybbuk for Two People" and "Interrogations," a piece based on Zen koans. All these performances were powerfully marked by ritual qualities. From 1977 to 1981 Jerzy Grotowski (1973, 1978) of the Polish Theater Laboratory collaborated with an international group, including part of a Voodoo community from Haiti, in the Theater of Sources Project, which involved participants bodily in a search for the sources of ritual. And in the summer of 1981 John Fox and Welfare State International of England, a group of "civic magicians" who design public celebrations, collaborated with Toronto Island residents in developing a week of celebra- tion rites called "The Tempest on Snake Island." These events epitomize a kind of action crucial both to the practice and study of religion, particularly ritual studies. I was invited as participant observer to the last two and have observed some of the results of the first two. Although important differences mark the experiments, they share a common ethos. They tap the cross-cultural resources of ritual and try to shake theater out of the slumber of aestheticism. They also foster enactments closely akin to those of religious practice. The attitude of these experimenters-with-symbolic- processes is neither premodern naivete nor modern secular irony. Instead, Ronald L. Grimes is Associate Professor of Religion and Culture at Wilfrid Laurier University. Among his publications are Symbol and Conquest (Cornell University Press, 1976) and articles in The Drama Review, Religious Studies Review, Voices, and Worship. His Beginning Ritual Studies has recently been published by University Press of America. Research for this article was made possible by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</page><page sequence="2">540 Ronald L. Grimes their mood is highly reflexive and seriously ludic, with a strong emphasis on processual motifs such as flight, search, transformation, flow, and pilgrimage. Sustained and, I think, successful attempts to generate postmodern ritual processes and actively incubate religious symbols are occuring outside the domains of sectarian movements or traditional religious institutions. Defining Ritual Taxonomies of action are not nearly so developed as generic studies of literary modes (see Gerhart; Tyson), so current terminology is makeshift. We use words such as "opus-process" (Grotowski, 1978:11), "paratheatrical event" (Mennen:1), "restored behavior" (Schechner, 1979:1), "ethnographic drama" (Turner, 1979:91), "liminoid phenomenon" (Turner, 1978:chap. 1), and "parashamanism" (Grimes, 1979b), as well as the many "ritual" deriva- tives such as "ritual exploration," "meta-ritual," and "ritual exercise." The proliferation of hyphenated terms and coining of neologisms are indications that a nascent genre of action, to which I refer as "ritualizing," is precipitat- ing a new view of ritual itself. Victor Turner's theories, especially his notions of the liminoid and communitas, continue to be fruitful for interpreting creative, processual elements in ritual. However, the definition of ritual which he uses does not convey the sense of it one finds either in his theories or the collaborative explorations./1/ He defines ritual as "formal behavior prescribed for occa- sions not given over to technological routine that have reference to beliefs in mystical beings or powers" (1978:243). This definition is not satisfactory for several reasons which I will summa- rize but not elaborate: (1) Rituals are sometimes composed of deformalizing behavior. "High" ritual moments may be more formalized than moments of ordinary action, but "low" ones may be less formalized. Deformalization is an important ritual strategy, not to be excluded or ignored by definition. (2) Magical rites are occasions which refer to mystical powers in a techno- logical manner, so ritual must not be definitionally separated from technology. (3) Not all ritual traditions or religions refer to mystical beings or powers. Zen Buddhism is a prime example. (4) Technological routine itself has a ritual quality which ought not be overlooked simply because it does not refer to divine beings. Most definitions of ritual are disappointing because they define the word too narrowly or lack fruitful images. Turner's genius is to have amplified a fertile image of ritual, namely, threshold-crossing. His expanding this image to include not only the liminal phases of rites of passage in traditional cul- tures but also liminoid phenomena in postmodern, industrial cultures implies, I think, the definition of ritualizing I am about to propose. Defining is an action of boundary-marking; it is a framing which establishes a center/periphery or figure/ground relation. Hence defining,</page><page sequence="3">Defining Nascent Ritual 541 like footnoting (cf. Lincoln), is a scholarly ritual in verbal form. Dictionary definitions, like many scholarly ones, express consensus views. Often they are functionally conservative. But not all defining, any more than all ritualizing, is by definition functionally conservative. Definitions may demarcate an established field and thus assert scholarly territoriality. But they may also point to unmapped frontiers in order to turn attention away from overworked areas. A "hard" definition is an abstractly stated consensus, established by a tradition of usage and calling attention to what is in bounds. A "soft" one typically congeals around nascent phenomena and calls attention to the bounding process itself or to the spaces between boundaries. It operates like a naming rite and develops largely on the basis of images. A hard definition of ritual is a "model of" (Geertz, 1966:7) properties of known rituals. A soft one is a "model for" attending to what is yet relatively unknown about them. Hard definitions attempt to establish a clear figure. Soft ones aim at surveying and connecting adjacent fields. I propose to comment on the fol- lowing "soft" definition for ritualizing, which is the process whereby ritual creativity is exercised: Ritualizing transpires as animated persons enact formative gestures in the face of receptivity during crucial times in founded places. Ritualizing Like "myth," when it is used as a synonym for "false belief," "ritual" has a bad reputation. In popular usage it connotes "boring, empty routine." The usual scholarly view is that ritual is (1) repeated (e.g., every Sabbath); (2) sacred (related to the Holy; of utmost significance); (3) formalized (consisting of prescribed, unchanging movements such as bowing or kneeling); (4) traditional (not being done for the first time; claiming an ancient history or authorized by myth); and (5) intentional (nonrandom actions, done with awareness of some reason or meaning). The popular definition of ritual identifies it pejoratively with "bad ritual," and the scholarly one, I suggest, too narrowly, with "liturgical ritual." I want to speak of "creative" or "nascent" ritual, so I use the name "ritualizing." Ritualizing is a process which occurs continually, and it may or may not result in stable structures that a culture deems "rituals." Ritual includes a variety of types, which I have identified elsewhere (1979a). Not all of them</page><page sequence="4">542 Ronald L. Grimes are handed down solely by cultural means nor do they all come from definable or longstanding traditions. Ritualizing emerges periodically in the interface between our cultural and genetic heritage. Some rituals are intentionally chosen, but others arise spontaneously or preconsciously. The danger of defining ritual in terms of more mature or sacred examples such as the Pass- over celebration or the Mass, is that we miss the continuity between habits, symptoms, or mannerisms, on the one hand, and civil ceremonies, formal liturgies, or ludic celebrations, on the other. Rituals are commonly spoken of as paradigms, models, or structures. They are regarded by anthropologists as ways of classifying the world. But if, in our scholarly taxonomies of these concrete ways of classifying, we do not attend to nascent as well as more traditional rites, we fall into the con- servative fallacy, which holds that rituals originated but cannot presently originate, that rituals do not change. Elements in Jung, Eliade, and Tillich tend toward this direction, but field studies show that rituals do change and are, in fact, being created. Therefore, I speak of "ritualizing" when I want to call attention to their originative moments. An example of nascent ritualizing is the simple but important discovery in three groups I have observed that people asked to walk in random direc- tions choose a counterclockwise direction more frequently than a clockwise one. Other examples are the flapping, flowing gestures in Brook's "Confer- ence of the Birds," guttural sounds of shadow puppets in Welfare State's "Tempest on Snake Island," Yoshi Oida's twisting and quivering as he wrestles with Zen koans. Any of these could be read as a mannerism, symp- tom, or aesthetic device. But I am suggesting that the context and intentions of directors and performers increasingly warrant our reading them also as momentary ritual gestures. When ritualizing instances such as these are recognized and developed, they become rites of passage, seasonal rites, meditative practices, carnival celebrations, and so on. But without an eye for their fragile first presence and a protected place for their incubation, we regularly abort the newest forms of ritual life, regarding them as symptoms of obsession-compulsion and habituation or ignoring them altogether as ran- dom and meaningless. Transpires Rituals are events; they have lifespans. Only secondarily do they reside in texts, scenarios, scripts, or rubrics. Thinking of them as unchanging is a half-truth. They are not artifacts. They are not structures in the sense that a building is a structure. They are structurings, as a dance is. They surge and subside, ebb and flow. One can infer the structure of a ritual. But the infer- ence is not the event. A ritual structure, like a ritual text, is a residue. And texts, as Walter Ong (421) reminds us, are monuments. Rituals deteriorate. Entropy is the rule, therefore, they must be raised up constantly from the</page><page sequence="5">Defining Nascent Ritual 543 grave of book, body, memory, and culture. Rituals have life cycles and life spans. They occur. They do not merely recur. A ritual is a performance, a "going through form." Schechner coins the provocative word "transformance" (1977:71) to suggest the change-evoking possibilities of ritual. "Ritual process," currently a much used term, encompasses numerous forms of ritual change: (1) the historical development, or revision, of a rit- ual, (2) the phases internal to a particular rite, (3) the "processing" of persons by a ritual, (4) the changing relations between rituals and their social con- text, and (5) the process whereby rituals give birth to other rituals, as when, "dharma combat" or Zen dokusan (formal master/disciple dialogue) spawns elements in ritualized actor-training workshops by Yoshi Oida. We can no longer assume that all forms of ritual are static. Ritual and "tradition" are not synonyms. Ritual and creativity are not mutually exclusive. In the Theater of Sources project, for example, San Soleil, a Haitian group, had two animator-directors, as well as a traditional Voodoo Houngan. Creativity as well as convention were evident. Rituals are not "givens," because we just as surely create them as we receive them from traditions and revelations. Ritualizing is the action by which we mediate what is given and what is made, what is involuntary and what is chosen. Rituals transpire (trans, spirare = to breathe across). Like breathing, ritual fluctuates in frequency, force, and volume according to its cultural context. The cultural animators of Welfare State International, for instance, give domestic force to celebration rites when they do child-namings, civic force when they ritually burn Parliament on Guy Fawkes Day, and dra- matic force when they do performances in theater festivals. They often design one-time events which are built and then deteriorate or go up in smoke. This breathlike rhythm is constituitive of their sense of ritual. Breath is containable (we can blow up balloons) and it is controllable (we can blow smoke rings). But breathing always gets away from us. Like- wise ritual. We can form it and modulate it, but because it is a response to processes that encompass and exceed us, we cannot contain it for long. It escapes, finds other forms, and spawns new modes. As for breathing, so for ritualizing: their semivoluntary, life-sustaining, phasic qualities are central. Rituals typically have phases but seldom anything like a plot. As a result, they cannot survive well by virtue of their entertainment value, as myths sometimes are able to do because of their narrative force. Ritualizing requires monotony and meandering; it is not reducible to causal, narrative, or rational sequences. This driftiness of logic and story line is undramatic, even though rituals may abound in theatrical elements such as greatly elabo- rated, elegantly proliferated symbols as one finds in Hispanic fiesta masses. For this reason a culture whose sense of symbol is largely narrativistic and climactic, as ours is, sometimes finds rituals boring. Ritual actions, we might say, curve with indirection or ambivalence; they have high evocative power but low entertainment value. While ritualizing, we pursue what compels us.</page><page sequence="6">544 Ronald L. Grimes As Animated Persons Who is the subject, or actor, of ritualizing is a complex question. One ritual actor does not necessarily displace another. Ritual actors are personae, so we begin to suspect ritualizing is occurring whenever a layering or strip- ping of identities intensifies. Ritualizing tends to co-vary directly with the coalescing of classificatory distinctions ordinarily kept separate, for instance, male/female, divine/demonic, human/animal. In "A Dybbuk for Two People" a deported spirit and an onstage character become so identified in a human actor, yet remain so separate, that they mutually animate one another. A person engaged in ritualizing is surrounded by brackets (which call attention to the parenthetical quality of what is enclosed in them), a special "frame" which transforms the relation between interior and exterior. One's exterior mask, or persona, to use the Latin root-idea, begins to resound with presence. I do not mean "mask" only in the ordinary sense of a facial cover- ing but in the broader, etymological one, which suggests that spirit can become fully resonant in exteriority-in the skin, demeanor, and style of action. A persona can be a deceptive display, a facade, but also an external revelation of what is deeply interior or wholly other than one's ordinary self. So by "persons" I mean to connote personae as they concretize and display values by means such as clothing, facial gesture, posture, or even objects. A person is one who invests surfaces with a sense of significance. A "person" in this sense may or may not be human. Humans do not have exclusive rights to ritualizing, as ethologists studying the mating and aggressive actions of animals have amply demonstrated (Huxley). Further- more, ritual experiments in shamanism such as those conducted by Michael Harner at the Center for Shamanic Studies suggest that "dancing one's animal" (66) is a modern possibility. The anima can manifest the persona of a divine animal. Whether the ritual persona is anthropomorphic, theomorphic, zoomor- phic, or otherwise, it is an animated persona, or, at least, it awaits animation. To animate is to "enspirit." However, rituals left unattended atrophy; per- sonae ossify and become mere dead, exterior things. So enlivening is needed. Illusion, sin, loss of potency, and lack of awareness are but a few of the modern ways of identifying what necessitates the continual re-animation of persons in ritualizing processes. Ritualizing usually presupposes that animation does not reside perma- nently in the exterior, which is why exteriority so easily is regarded as an inert shell awaiting a breath of life. So I use the term "animation" because it suggests that the compelling force of ritual exceeds private ownership. Whether we imagine the animating power as a soul, deeper self, god, state, spirit, animal, cosmos, or society, the body in some sense borrows the life breathed into it. In this respect all ritual persons are mask- or puppetlike. This quality of</page><page sequence="7">Defining Nascent Ritual 545 contemporary ritual actors is marvelously illustrated by Bread and Puppet Theater as the giant puppet head of the washerwoman in "Washerwoman Nativity" seems to animate the tiny human legs and arms of the animator below it. Enact "Act" is the proper root word. "Behavior" is what an observer sees. "Action" is what someone does. An "actor" is both one who does and one who pretends to do. A ritual enactment is not an ordinary action like chang- ing a tire, nor is it an imitation of an action such as pretending to die on a stage. Rather it is a kind of action which is in a category distinct from either of these. It is action thick with sensory meaning. Ritual action should not be considered "transcendent" in contrast to dramatic action, which is "pretend." Such a view does violence both to theater and to religion. Ritual personages often put-on, and theater people sometimes find acting to be a mode of real contact with "The Wholly Other." The difference between ritual and drama, then, has to do, not with the differences between belief and make-belief or doing and pretending, but with the degree to which the acting in both senses is felt to be in touch with inescapable rhythms like the Tao, historically definitive transitions like the Exodus, or deep processes like the collective unconscious. The enactment which a ritual actor performs is not necessarily goal- oriented or intentional. Unintentional, nongoal-oriented actions such as playing and gamboling, as well as preconscious habits and mannerisms, must not be excluded by definition from ritual, since they are the seedbeds of ritualizing. Ritual does not originate solely in, nor is it exhaustively explain- able by, conscious actions and theological rationale. Particularly in Grotow- ski's forest explorations participants learn to run, whirl, dance, and walk with a kind of circular, sensory attunement to the environment without the intervention of conscious intentionality. Ritual actions are not without sense just because those doing them can- not say what the actions mean. Ecclesiastical liturgies and civil ceremonies may have verbal meanings codified or separable from their actions, but these are specific instances and should not be considered definitive for nascent ritualizing. Neither rituals nor their symbols necessarily have "mean- ing," a metaphor borrowed with only partial success from linguistics (see Sperber). Rituals are deeds; they are not just colorful or oblique ways of "saying" something. In ritual enactment we attempt to wed the indicative and subjunctive, the literal and symbolic, the real and the dramatic. In Brook's "Conference of the Birds" we know we are seeing ordinary people moving with colored strips of cloth, yet we also know we have seen the real Hoopoe bird and followed it to the king. In ritualizing we act in the interstices between</page><page sequence="8">546 Ronald L. Grimes means-end acts and imitations of actions. In doing so, one may build huts or enact roles from traditional scenarios, but such acts are not definitive of ritualizing. What is definitive are enactments that momentarily bridge the real/dramatic split by embodying it. Apart from embodiment no ritual enactment transpires (see Dixon:419). Even rituals such as meditative ones, calculated to deny or overcome the tangible, use the body in order to effect this denial. And even when the body is decorated or mutilated with tatoos, circumcisions, and subincisions, or is so heavily draped and costumed that it becomes a thing, it remains the central, concrete fact of ritual. The study of ritual fails, then, if it ignores the tangibility and subjectivity of ritual enactment and only objectifies (see Driver). Formative Gestures It is common to regard rituals as enactments of myths, theological ideas, or moral principles. The result of these views has been to reduce ritual to mere illustration or to treat the body as if it were only incidental to enactment. The ritualizing moment, when enactments begin to form, is a nondiscursive, bodily way of knowing, not to be disparaged when it lacks narrative or systematic elaboration. In fact, intellectual exegesis, especially in the midst of nascent ritual, can insure its deformation, if not its death. So I am suggesting that "formative gestures" are primary, and narrative, moral, or intellectual formulations secondary objects of enactment. If, for example, I want to interpret a Haitian dance before Saint Soleil, I should attend to the style and rhythm of the dance's gestures before leaping to stories or expo- sitions associated with it. Ritual studies proceeds best if we attend first to a ritual's least verbalizable qualities, its "choreography" and "musicality," and then to its "meaning" or "function." Done in reverse order, interpreters often find lots of "meaningless" gestures which never receive the dignity of being regarded as symbols. Ritual actions such as eating or drinking during the Eucharist can inform basic gestural values, such as those held by a consumer-oriented society. But the reverse is also true: social values can penetrate ritual gestures, as might happen when an agape feast is revived by a consumer- oriented society. Ritual gestures constitute a class of mediating actions which transform the style and values of everyday action, thereby becoming the very ground of action itself. Ritual gesture, therefore, always concerns the sources of action. The basic unit of ritual is a symbol, but not every symbol is ritualistic. Only those symbols which are, or evoke, gestures are of ritualistic signifi- cance. A symbolic object, for example, a statue of the Boddhisatva Kuan-yin, because it is easier to isolate, can draw our attention away from the actions it evokes. The interpretation of an action is more difficult than the interpre- tation of an object, but this should not prevent our focusing interpretive</page><page sequence="9">Defining Nascent Ritual 547 efforts on gesture, the heart of ritualizing. The color red, a circular shape, a totem pole, a sacred grove are ritual symbols only by virtue of the symbolic gestures they evoke. Gesturing and posturing, the fundamental units of ritual enactment, are dialectically related to the baseline of ordinary interaction, even though they may be embedded in it. Enactment consists of not only socially warranted gestures or those based on a scenario or text but also unconsciously animated actions. And gestures so motivated may appear twisted, oblique, or exagger- ated to such a degree that they elicit interpretations which are themselves symbolic. In other words, ritualizing tends to set in motion a regressive series of interpretations, the language (or actions) of which are themselves quasi- ritualistic. A gesture, in the strict sense of the word, is a dynamic symbolic act which contrasts with posture, a symbolic stilling of action. But in its broader usage "gesture" includes both movements and poses as bearers of evocative power. In this broader sense "gesture" is virtually a synonym for "attitude." An attitude is not simply a state of mind or set of values. It is the total bearing of a body which expresses a valued style of living. A ship's attitude is its tilt, which expresses the dynamic interplay among the direction and force of the wind, the weight of the boat, and the size of its sails. To interpret a ritual attitude one must learn to recognize style, and style is hardly perceivable with one viewing. We only recognize an actor's style by seeing him or her in several roles. Whether we consider gesture, style, attitude, or symbolic action, avoiding excessive reification is important, so I have added the qualifier "formative." Others might have said "archetypal," "fundamental" or "paradigmatic." How- ever, these ways of putting the matter have a history of becoming entangled with static objectifications. As soon as we say "forms" instead of "formative," we can easily lose track of the flowlike, verblike qualities of ritual. A gesture is an evocative rhythm embodied in an enactment (cf. Delattre:282-84). What it evokes are the feelings and sensibilities that can be said to be "generative" or "formative" of culture. A good example of formative gesturing in Welfare State's "Tempest" project with the Toronto Islanders was the construction and ritual destruction of cultural monuments, for instance, a model CN Tower ("the world's tallest freestanding structure") and a cardboard reproduction of the Toronto skyline. The group used junk and refuse that had washed ashore, built a momentary symbolic city, and then returned it to junk again. If such a gestural rhythm of construction and destruction were deeply absorbed by participants, I would expect to find new cultural values forming outside the celebration. We might find, for example, a more creative use of discarded materials or less need for architectural displays of technological prowess. Among performance artists the gesture of recycling is becoming a useful metaphor for the way ritualizing itself occurs. Romantic symbol theorists such as Thomas Carlisle, William Blake, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge usually set</page><page sequence="10">548 Ronald L. Grimes organic and industrial metaphors in opposition: one "gestates" rather than "constructs" symbols. But "re-cycling," not just as an environmental ideology but as a metaphor for ritual creativity, combines organic and industrial metaphors and is understood to imply that one must "receive," as well as "create," ritual gestures. Ritualizing is how we actively await formative pulsations. The goal of ritualizing activities is not to be orginal-this is a modern aesthetic concern-but to locate and attend to originative impulses. Ritualizing activities such as Grotowski's experiments with running, whirling, and walking in the Polish "forest womb" are not formalized as, say, the wedding walk is in Protestant ceremonies. The gestures are "forma- tive," which means they are transformatively related to everyday actions. A formative gesture emerges in a way that enables either formalization or deformalization. Both are of ritual value, but the study of ritual has wrongly concentrated all its energies on the positive, formal instances. The negative aspects are most obvious in certain meditation rites, rites of rebellion, and carnival inversion. In these a minus sign is gesturally posted before cultural forms. In Welfare State's ritual clowning and mumming, to cite one example, the minus is placed before the ritual form itself: a Caliban figure baptizes us with polluted water from Lake Ontario. Formative gestures are physical ways of searching for the sources of creativity, struggling to connect what feels disconnected, trying to discern climactic turns in ongoing processes, and becoming receptive to death or other radical transformations. Ritualizing is a mode of knowing (see Jennings) in which knower and known conjoin. The outcome can serve either to maintain or undermine psychosocial chasms, but in either case it not only elicits reflection on cultural forms but re-shapes our bodies, and thus our minds, to be congruent with these forms. Ritualizing enactments operate dialectically under circumstances in which polarities are too important to be chosen between, so participants seek some third way on a plane different from that occupied by the first two alternatives. A ritual enactment is an attempt to comment gesturally on a psychosocial double-bind (see Bateson). But since ritualizing must embody the very rift it would reflect on, the mood of it becomes more ambivalent the closer its gestures come to revealing the vulnerable heart of some psychosocial rift. Ritual enactment at once awakens the reflexivity of consciousness and tranquilizes the anxiety provoked by doing so. Torontonians were delighted to see their city and tower symbolically burned by Welfare State; they were also horrified. Ambivalence is the heart of the ritualizing attitude. In the Face of Receptivity Ritualizing is enactment in the face of imagined, socially experienced, and mythologically construed receptivity. For ritualizing to occur the surroundings must expose a vulnerable (vulner = wound) side. Whether the</page><page sequence="11">Defining Nascent Ritual 549 vulnerability stems from a human or divine face does not seem definitive, but that some aspect of the cosmos appears to be responsive, to present a face, is necessary for ritualizing to gestate. The more deeply an enactment is received, the more an audience becomes a congregation and the more a performance becomes ritualized. "Sacred" is the name we give to the deepest forms of receptivity in our experience. One's "face," as I am using the term, reveals formative attitudes. To countenance is to show an attitude of support. The face before which ritual- izing is enacted is not reducible to the mere surface or front part of some- thing. Rather the face is that facet upon which some action depends. This is the sense of the word when we refer to the face of a document or the face we lose in "losing face." For most of us our face is the exterior area by which presence is mediated to others. It is that tangible surface by which vulnerability is exposed or withheld. In Western cultures we regard our faces, or perhaps our genitals, as our most vulnerable physical areas, so actions emanating from them tend to be the most ritualized by gestures of guarding or displaying. When analyzing a specific ritual, we must always ask where a given culture locates its faces and how it stylizes them into countenances. Because receptivity is essential to ritualizing, gestural enactment always has a communicative, as well as cognitive, dimension, even when it is performed in solitude. A ritual enactment must be received by others, perhaps the Wholly Other, perhaps the ancestors, perhaps the powers that be, perhaps a therapist, perhaps only the tourists and anthropologists. The face of receptivity is variously named: "emptiness," "a supportive community," "God." And it is variously located in the unconscious, society, surrounding environment, or attendant spirits. Sometimes the principle of receptivity is in need of energizing by the actions of ritual; at other times it is actively solicitous. In either case the face of receptivity is not objectifiable though it is "other." It is as much inside the ritual actor as outside. In grammar we differentiate the active and passive "voices" of verbs. When interpreting ritual processes, we likewise distinguish action and recep- tivity. A decline in the importance of ritual is usually signaled by a sympto- matic loss of receptivity and a consequent confusion of enactment with sheer willful activity divorced from cultivated passivity. If we consider rites in terms of their active-passive "ratio," magical rites are high on the active side and meditative ones, on the receptive side. It is no accident, then, that the ritually creative projects developed by directors like Grotowski, Brook, and Fox are characterized by a specifically meditative or celebrative ethos. During Crucial Times Crucial times are "cross-tensed" in a variety of ways. Cyclical time is a crossing of present and past; eschatological time, of present and future. We</page><page sequence="12">550 Ronald L. Grimes are too prone to regard as timeless all senses of time other than the chrono- logical. But notions like "the eternal now" (Tillich), "eternal return" (Eliade), "dreamtime" (the Arunta "alcheringa"), as well as the "just now" of Gestalt or Zen, are not identical. The sense of timing in a ritual is as distinctive as it is in a piece of music. One example of ritual time is associated with transitions-changes in social status, seasonal transitions, and crisis moments in histories and life cycles. Ritualizing often precipitates or accompanies a sense of "the time between the times" and so is manifested by gestures which heighten feelings and calm them with monotony in the same moment. Grotowski collects watches and takes participants on unscheduled night prowlings, and Fox times "Tempest" to coincide with sunset in order to displace the usual sense of chronologically ordered time. Ritual is formative of the ways we bide our time. Rituals concentrate, and thereby consecrate, time. The auspicious moment (Booth), the kairos, is a pulse of opening and closing. It occurs when enactment and receptivity are in synchrony. Such times can occur without warning in illness, disaster, or social breach./2/ Ritualizing processes spontaneously proliferate in these moments. No one has to decide to create them. So, unlike established ceremonies and liturgies, they do not have to be regularly repeated. This sense of transition time is a hotbed of nascent ritual symbols. Times concentrated in this manner feel timeless, quick, of short duration. Another sense of crucial timing is "anticipated time," or what some, following Mircea Eliade (chap. 2), call "circular time." Circular time is not the only form of ritually concentrated time, though this is the view of many who talk about ritual. The return of the Sabbath, the arrival of yet another new year, commencement day for still another class of graduates are times that establish the cycles which constitute our sense of the way things flow. We know they are coming; they do not surprise us. In them time is not "timeless," leaving us feeling as though it hardly exists. Rather it is "time- ful." It weighs on us; it reminds us. In this kind of time we ponder the weight of the ages. Unlike "unanticipated transition time," this "anticipated returning time" is not focused at a point and felt as a breakthrough or breakup. Instead it feels like an overlap or reversion. We must not forget, then, that ritually crucial times involve both once- in-a-life times and here-we-go-again times. The former are more character- istic of artists' experiments with ritualizing processes, the latter, of civil ceremonies and traditional liturgical rites. A rite of passage combines both examples of ritual time. In Founded Places Founding may occur literally, for example, when a group of Poles and Haitians construct a "forest womb" or a group of English and Canadians</page><page sequence="13">Defining Nascent Ritual 551 establish stations for a procession-celebration on Snake Island. There are many ways to set aside the foundational substructure of ritual. But founding a space may also occur by defining an area with actions, rather than cordoning off an area with rope or erecting huts. Snake Island became a "founded" place by our processions to it and dances on it; the Polish forest, by our standing still among its trees, lying on its floor, crawling through its underbrush. Space, which is empty, uniform, and abstract, is given shape and life so it may become a ritual place such as a burial ground, courtroom, or cathedral, all of which are curiously vacant, even haunting, when the actions of ritual are not occurring in them. Ritual place is a matrix of ritual life. It is a generative center, though it may be geographically on the edges. A founded place is sequestered from the hubbub even when it consists only of a circle formed by Welfare State musicians in an urban shopping center. A founded place is a forcefield eliciting gestures from ritual actors. Ritualizing may occur without objects or implements but not without founded (fundus = bottom, fundamental) places. Ritual traditions differ in their views about the length of time such a place is pregnant with formative power. For some, the founding ends the moment the action ceases. For others, the place is set aside once-for-all by consecration. Founded space and sacred objects coalesce in the art of the "new ritual artists," many of whom are painters or sculptors who emphasize wrapped, layered, and bundled assemblages which are large enough to enclose people and elicit formal installations or other ritual actions (Murray). Founding, essential to all ritual, public and esoteric, occurs with the establishment of perspectival boundaries: inside/outside, hidden/revealed, open/closed, front/ back. The distinction participant/observer is most fundamentally displayed by where and how one stands when ritual action is occurring. Not only is space founded to become ritual place, but actors themselves become grounded by acting in it. We hide, display, and boundary-mark ourselves by the way we transform space into place. How we do this determines the extent to which we are an insider or outsider. The ways we cross the boundaries of a founded place say who we are. Founding is more than mere neutral setting aside. It is to sequester, to spirit away; the action, implicitly at least, hides as much as it reveals. Of course there are public rituals; not all rites are esoteric. But even public rituals display, however minimally, some potentially secretive quality. Often the mere establishment of a front and back side of the action is enough. Naming Emergent Genres of Action Ritualizing transpires as animated persons enact formative gestures in the face of receptivity during crucial times in founded places.</page><page sequence="14">552 Ronald L. Grimes By naming ritualizing in this fashion, I am arguing for the legitimacy of explorations such as those of Grotowski and the Haitians, Welfare State International and the Toronto Islanders, Brook and Turnbull, Schechner and Turner. Ricoeur says that naming a genre is not a mere nominalistic exercise: "To master a genre is to master a 'competence' which offers practical guidelines for 'performing' an individual work" (135). To engage in ritualizing processes is to conduct research, not just on, but in, ritual. This is a fact of postmodern culture. And it is a phenomenon no longer easily written off as private pathology, idiosyncrasy, or irresponsible syncretism. Postmodern ritualizing has indissoluble links to both theater and healing, and my way of naming, I hope, lays theoretical grounds for developing the connections further. Directors and therapists establish founded places. Therapists see clients at crucial times. Artists and counselors are attentive to gestural symbols. Actors aspire to animate audiences, and therapists aspire to provide faces of receptivity. And so on. These facts are bound to provoke the question, "How does ritualizing differ from theater and therapy?" In some cases not at all- especially in traditional shamanistic and postmodern, liminoid subcultures such as experimental theater circles. If each of the terms of my soft defini- tion is treated as a criterion, current dramatic and healing practices some- times apear ritual-like, but often crucial factors are missing for ritualizing processes to develop into established ritual structures. A great deal of theo- retical and field research is needed before we can specify with any confidence how rituals and ritual systems develop from nascent ritualizing processes. Processual and developmental thinking about rituals is relatively recent,/3/ but already it shows us that we have erroneously defined the whole of ritual in terms of its middle phases to the neglect of its emergent and decaying ones. A clear priority for ritual studies is the formulation of precise, developmental typologies which do not preclude our connecting ritualization among animals, personal mannerisms, decorous actions, civil ceremony, liturgy, and celebration events. Therefore, I hope ritual studies goes easy on exclusive, hard defining, since this scholarly strategy of boundary-marking is more useful for the middle age of a field. Instead, by more softly naming nascent ritualizing, we can recognize and nurture what is still in incubatory phases. NOTES /1/ Two provocative, but less well known, definitions of ritual are as follows: Rituals are "the acting out of metaphoric predication upon inchoate pronouns which are in need of movement" (Fernandez:56) and "those carefully rehearsed symbolic motions and gestures through which we regularly go, in which we articulate the felt shape and rhythm of our own humanity and of reality as we experience it, and by</page><page sequence="15">Defining Nascent Ritual 553 means of which we negotiate the terms or conditions for our presence among and our participation in the plurality of realities through which our humanity makes its passage" (Delattre:282). /2/ Victor Turner (1978:chaps. 2, 3) has provided two excellent studies of ritual processes in the midst of social breach. One is on the Mexican Revolution, the other on the clash between Thomas Becket and Henry II. /3/ Besides the work of Turner, Erik Erikson's "The Development of Ritualization" is especially important in this regard.
