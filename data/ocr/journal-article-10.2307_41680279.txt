Authors of books on "the humble home" often mention this feature of the poetics of space. But this mention is much too succinct. Finding little to describe in the humble home, they spend little time there; so they describe it as it actually is, without really experiencing its primitive- ness, a primitiveness which belongs to all, rich and poor alike, if they are willing to dream. - Gaston Bachelard, The Poetics of Space (1958) During the 1950s, modernist architects tended to privilege the "primitive" and the vernacular while disdaining the revival of historical models, which had been a fundamental element of academic training in architecture.1 Rejecting historicist ap- proaches, they reached back in time, beyond national borders, to embrace pre-industrial, indigenous, and anonymous architecture from around the world in order to ground their work with an anthropological dimension that would offset the generic universalism imputed to rationalist modernism. By invok- ing caves, tents, and grottoes - especially in the design of sacred buildings - architects sought to materially "make present" the authenticating phenomenon of remoteness. Fascination with the primitive mani- fested itself in art and literature in parallel with the rise of industrialization and colo- nization from the mid-eighteenth through the twentieth century. Subversive and paradoxical examples of this phenomenon reflected the opposition that proponents of the Enlightenment directed toward traditional belief systems. It also illustrated their advocacy of empirical, naturalist, and material approaches to knowledge as well as their embrace of the notion of a fundamental continuity between humans and nature. Proponents of the Enlightenment challenged academic and historicist attitudes grounded in the classical cultures of Europe, and they rejected the decadence of "civilization" with a dialectical return to "origins." Though historical research has addressed the appeal of the primitive and savage in art and literature, the same cannot be claimed for the field of architecture. As architectural his- torian Adrian Forty pointed out in his recent essay "Primitive: The Word and Concept," nineteenth- and twentieth-century architects have rarely critically interrogated (much less stigmatized) the term primitive or scrutinized its political implications with the sustained attention of anthropologists.2 Since the mid-eighteenth century, at least in architecture, the word primitive has been deployed discursively in relation to the "origins" of building; it has also been examined with regard to tectonics and type. At different moments and in different cultural contexts, such terms as archaic , rustic , natural , rural, pre-modem, pre-industrial, and vernacular - as well as native, naïve, indigenous, and peasant - have been invoked to describe primitive architectural forms and practices. There is a pressing need to more fully understand the specific cultural and historical meanings and implica- tions that such terms carry in the discourses of architecture and space. In the Abbé Laugier's Essai sur l'architecture (1755), the notion of the cabane rustique or rustic hut, most often rendered in English as "primitive hut," was privileged (and not insignificantly, as the terms rustic and primitive have been conflated ever since). During the twentieth century this debate continued to unfold in the context of post-World War II critiques of modernism. Following Sibyl Moholy-Nagy's Native Genius in Anonymous Architecture of 1957 and Bernard Rudofsky's text (and concurrent exhibition) Architecture Without Architects of 1964, Myron Goldfinger, in his Villages in the Sun: Mediterranean Com- munity Architecture of 1969, stressed how Mediterranean vernacular buildings fulfilled "man's spiritual and spatial needs."3 i A more extensive version of this essay is scheduled to appear as part of: Ben Nicholson and Michelangelo Sabatino, eds., Forms of Spiri- tuality: Modernist Architecture and Land- scape in New Harmony. 2 Adrian Forty, "Primi- tive: The Word and Concept," in Primi- tive: Original Matters in Architecture , ed.

(Repr. p. 189) The first half of the twentieth century also witnessed widespread interest in the architecture of caves, especially among expressionist architects (for example: Hans Poelzig's Grosses Schauspielhaus, Berlin, 1919, and Rudolf Steiner's Goetheanum in Dörnach, Switzerland, 1928). [Fig. 1] However, it was during the years following the end of World War II that a return to the primitive, partially in response to the deploy- 140</page><page sequence="3">Michelangelo Sabatino Fig. 2 Le Corbusier, exterior view of the Chapel of Notre -Dame -du -Haut , Ronchamp, 1954. (Repr. p. 188) ment of destructive technologies during the war, was most significant. During the 1950s Le Corbusier unsettled functionalists when he completed his cave-like Chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut at Ronchamp (1954), a commission he received from the Roman Catholic Dominican priest Marie- Alain Couturier.4 The archaic, load-bearing rubble walls and the absence of "standard- ized" elements in the concrete contours of Ronchamp caused the young British arch- itect James Stirling to accuse Le Corbusier of provoking a "crisis of rationalism."5 [Figs. 2-3] Although Le Corbusier rejected historicism, he had looked to primitivism since the 1930s for justification in appropri- ating elements of pre-industrial vernacular buildings to infuse modernity with a spiritual dimension he found lacking in "functionalist" architecture.6 This began with his Mediter- ranean masterpiece, the Villa de Mandrot in Le Pradet, which was completed in 1 931 , just two years after his Villa Savoye.7 Following Le Corbusier, the Austrian-bom architect Frederick J. Kiesler challenged what he derided as "pseudo-functionalism."8 In the Grotto for Meditation (1962-65), a project in the small midwestern town of New Harmony, Indiana, that was never built, Kiesler sought to fuse modern construction and primitive, primordial spatiality to create Fig. 4 Frederick J. Kiesler, Grotto for Meditation, Site plan and elevations, Photograph, 1962-63. a cave-like interior of profound spiritual resonance. [Fig. 4] The Parisian poet and essayist Tristan Tzara, an interlocutor and friend of Kiesler's, identified the Eskimo yurt as an "intermediary form between the grotto and the tent."9 Kiesler's initial visit to New Harmony in 1962, in response to an invitation from Jane Blaffer Owen, who had commissioned Philip Johnson's Roofless Church (1960), awakened in him a series of possibilities as he contemplated the design of a cave or grotto as a tribute to the liberal theologian Paul Tillich. [Fig. 5] Tillich's invocation of the cave in a metaphorical theological construct, the "cave of the New Being," played an important role in framing the design process.10 In a drawing that Kiesler sketched prior to his visit to New Harmony, there is no evidence of a cave or grotto. Following his visit, Kiesler wrote of New Harmony as a "beautifully magic" place in which one could find "primitive craftsmanship."11 Paying careful attention to the site-specific, natural qualities of the landscape of New Harmony, Kiesler observed: The wood. Trunks of once massive trees are laid horizontally and form interior wall embankments. They were split into heavy-weight planks. Flat logs resting atop the shoulder of the others. The inter- val between them, one two and three inch gaps, have been filled with cloud- grey cement. These horizontal streaks running between the log-planks appear like rivers among shore-banks of dreams. Beautifully magic. Primitive crafts- manship re-evoked through love for the honesty of fundamental origins.12 Kiesler identified native Indiana flora and fauna as essential to the physical landscape and spiritual character of New Harmony, and he set about designing a building that could embody the strange tension in the dialogue between science 141 5 James Stirling, "Ronchamp: Le Corbusier's Chapel and the Crisis of Ratio- nalism," Architectural Review, March 1956, 1 55-61 .

Furthermore, Kiesler's attraction for the lifestyle of the "Hamptons Bohemia" - whose members oscillated between the urbanity of New York City and the freedom of the natural world of Long Island - likely awakened a desire for an architecture of presentness and remoteness.13 The fish- shaped weather vane of the Owen Labora- tory in New Harmony, designed in 1859 by James Renwick, best exemplifies this tension. By framing the symbolic qualities of the fish (in light of its association with Christian iconography) within the scientific mindset of the progressive intellectuals that New Harmony's community organizers, Robert Owen and William Maclure, brought to southwestern Indiana on the "Boatload of Knowledge" in 1826, Kiesler (himself part of the "Boatload of Madmen" that came to America) was able to conceive of a building that was both magical (because it defied conventional post-and-beam construction) and technologically advanced insofar as it used a "continuous structure" of thin-shell concrete construction.14 Kiesler's desire to transcend "pseudo- functionalism" found expression in his design of the Grotto for Meditation and in an equally compelling local parallel, the New Harmony labyrinth - originally planned by the Rappites, the German religious sect that founded New Harmony prior to the arrival of Owen and Maclure's community.15 [Fig. 6] Although it is unclear whether Kiesler visited the 1941 reconstruction of the labyrinth during his first visit to New Harmony, it occupied a central place in the pious devotions of the Rappites. When they left New Harmony in 1824 and moved to Ambridge (Old Economy Village), Pennsylvania, they built what they called a grotto with a rough stone exterior and a smooth, polished stucco interior. This material contrast was supposed to be an allegory of a human being, rough on the outside but good on the inside. Fig. 5 Philip Johnson, Roofless Church, New Harmony, Indiana, 1960. (Repr. p. 189) Fig. 6 Ben Nicholson, Essential Geometry of the New Harmony Labyrinth, private collection, 2009. Kiesler recorded his fascination with the mollusks of the Wabash River and a specimen conch shell he was shown by Jane Owen in New Harmony. It is unlikely that he would have seen American Conchol- ogy, published by Thomas Say in New Harmony in 1830, or the sketches of Say's collaborator, Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, both passengers on the Boatload of Knowl- edge.16 By fusing "scientific" nature with "irrational" faith, Kiesler laid bare the drama of contemporary life as it was unfolding in an era of secularization and psychoanalysis.17 He also tapped into an interest in nature that was part of the surrealist mindset, evident in the strange plant and animal world illustrated by Max Ernst in his Histoire naturelle of 1926. 18 [Fig. 8] It is likely that Kiesler would have known of Ernst's work, especially since Ernst was married to Peggy Guggenheim in the early 1940s when Kiesler designed the cave-like Art of This Century Gallery for her on 57th Street in New York.19 [Fig. 7] Of the different avenues of inquiry into the realm of nature inspiring form, it is Fig. 7 Frederick J.

Ghyka's fascination for the harmonious geometry of the nombre d'or- that was closest to Kiesler's vein of inquiry during his design of the New Harmony grotto. Not by coincidence, Kiesler's Endless House (1959) is closer in shape to a beehive than to anything resembling Euclidean geometry.20 142 13 Helen A.

Adrian Forty has pointed out that concrete - "a material without a history" - often carries with it associations of a low-tech, non-modern material.21 Reinforced concrete can echo the stéréoto- mie masses of vaulted stone construction typical of the Mediterranean basin; it can also emphasize stability and durability rather than transparency. Other types of cavern- ous, stéréotomie structures that parallel Kiesler's interest in the grotto and cave are found in the built environments of visionary artists of the American Midwest, although it is uncertain whether Kiesler visited any of them.22 These sites were often designed to stimulate religious devotion. The grotto and the cave figure prominently in the work of Father Mathias Wernerus - the Dickeyville Grotto in Dickeyville, Wisconsin (1920-31)- and Father Paul Dobberstein - the Grotto of the Redemption in West Bend, Iowa (1912-59). [Figs. 9-1 1] These grot- toes evoke the mystery of creation through symbolism while also employing such found materials as rocks and shells.23 The random, ornate surfaces that resulted would have intrigued Kiesler, who wanted to cover the external surface of his grotto with pink tile. Correspondence from 1964 attests to Kiesler's consultation on the selection of mosaic tiles with Mathias Goeritz, the Mexico City artist who collaborated with architects Luis Barragán and Juan O'Gorman.24 That Kiesler was fascinated by the idea of combining the Christian symbol of the fish (although in his design for New Harmony the fish gradually assumed the shape of a dolphin) with the primitive cave or grotto, the first dwelling place, reveals his interest in a secular spirituality. Secular yet spiritual spaces and places rely upon non-conventiona cues (a cave in place of a Latin cross) to evoke the presence of the sacred without necessarily resorting to conventional sym- bols. Among the well-known examples of grottoes that evoke magic and wonder, the Blue Grotto of Capri, "rediscovered" in 1826 by the fisherman Angelo Ferraro, stands out. The Grotto of Massabielle in the town of Lourdes (Hautes-Pyrénées), France - where the Blessed Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to a fourteen-year-old girl, Bernadette Soubirous - is another important site that Kiesler might have been familiar with even if he didn't actually visit it. As a Jew, Kiesler knew the story of the prophet 19 Susan Davidson and Philip Ry lands, eds., Peggy Guggenheim &amp; Frederick Kiesler : The Story of the Art of This Century (Venice and Vienna: Peggy Guggenheim Col- lection and Austrian Frederick and Lilian Kiesler Private Foundation, 2004). 20 Friedrick Kiesler: Endless House (Ostfildern-Ruit : Verlag Gerd Hat je, 2003), 29-49.

By this, I hoped to point out our connection not only with human beings, but with the animal world, with vegetation, and with water and fire - the whole cosmic array of infinity. Although small in size, the Grotto for Meditation was intended to give visitors a chance to concentrate, to expand their feelings and coordi- nates with the cosmic world.26 Kiesler was interested in the threshold moment, when a visitor looked into the grotto from outside and simultaneously felt the presence of the Indiana sky, surrounding nature, and the dim interior. Simultaneous with his work on the Grotto for Meditation, Kiesler and Armand P. Bartos were completing the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem, Israel. Dedicated in 1965, the year of Kiesler's death, the shrine is an abstract white-tiled dome set on a rubble stone foundation. [Fig. 12] Although Fig. 12 Frederick J. Kiesler and Armand P. Bartos, Shrine of the Book, 1965. Photograph by Ezra Stoller. (Repr. p. 188), not a cave, it evokes the cave as a place of primordial dwelling in the contrast between its ethereal dome and earthy rubble-wall base. In fact, the contents of the shrine, the Dead Sea Scrolls, were discovered in caves. This continuity with context might lead one to consider Kiesler's design for the Grotto for Meditation as deriving frani his absorption in the nature, history, and materiality of New Harmony, undermining the presumption that the modern vanguard broke completely with context. It is unclear exactly how Kiesler's grotto fit into the discourse of Paul Tillich, who it was to honor. In an essay on contemporary Protestant architecture, Tillich wrote: "An element of risk is unavoidable in the building of sacred places just as a risk must be taken in every act of faith."27 Tillich developed his notion of what he called "the cave of the New Being" as part of a larger theological idea of redemption and discovery through coming to terms with a post-anthropomorphic and post-theistic apprehension of God.28 The primitive in modern architecture is elusive but continuous in the design of sacred places. By engaging the physical and spiritual qualities of a historically charged site and the compelling natural beauty of New Harmony, Kiesler's Grotto for Meditation challenged the nihilism of modern rationalism during the atomic age. . 144 25 In addition, the grotto is associated with the belief of some theologians that Jesus was born in a cave near Bethlehem and not in a stable as recounted in the Gospel of Luke. 26 Frederick Kiesler, "The Grotto for Meditation , " Craft Horizons, July-August 1966, 22-27. 27 Paul Tillich, "Con- temporary Protestant Architecture" in Albert Christ-Janer and Mary Mix Foley, Modern Church Archi- tecture (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1962), 122-25. 28 Tillich also wrote a number of reflec- tions on "dwelling" in the early 1930s.
