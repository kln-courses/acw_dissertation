London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1970. ~2.40 The sub-title of this work, 'The evolution of the human brain' gives the true indication of its scope, although introductory chapters</page><page sequence="2">324 BOOK REVIEWS elaborate 'intelligence' partly as brain activity shared with other animals and focusing upon 'ability to cope with our world' . . . and partly the capacity, unique to man, for conceptual thought. The develop- ment of the latter is correlated with the evo- lution of man's cerebral hemispheres and it is to an exposition of the pathway by which these have emerged that the present book is directed. In presenting this topic, the volume not only brings up to date classical works by such students as the late Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, but also proceeds further, both in viewing and presenting this material in the light of modem neurological thought, and in tracing the evolution of sensory and motor mechanisms from the stage found in the more highly organised Protozoa, through the nerve net of Coelenterates, to the development of one-way conduction through the synapse, and thence to the simple reflex arc. Following an account of properties of the earliest ganglionic nervous systems, the text progresses to a description and appraisal of the significance of a unified neural tube and thence to the first appearance of the autono- mic nervous system. This leads to a group of chapters dealing, in presumed evolutionary sequence, with the various levels of sensory mechanism, and this is followed by a cor- responding series relating to the motor sys- tem. In the final chapters of the main text Elliott enquires into the relationship between man's unique cerebral development and the development of his social systems, and the evolutionary significance that attaches to the ability, conferred by the development of speech, to transmit culture and ideas by mechanisms distinct from the genetic system. Certain facets of this work may be criticised. For instance, the, at times, emotional and somewhat extravagant style of writing, coup- led with occasional anthropomorphic inter- pretation, might be interpreted as indicating a lack of objectivity. Again, the functioning of some nervous mechanisms is still im- perfectly understood and individual neuro- anatomists could well take issue with specific interpretations. But such criticism does not detract from the fact that Elliott has produced a significant monograph in the fields of both social and physical anthropology. In this he has been ably supported by Ravielli from whose pen there has emanated an out- standing series of accompanying illustrations. ERIC H. ASHTON</page></plain_text>
