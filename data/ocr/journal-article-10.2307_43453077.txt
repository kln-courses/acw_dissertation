<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Future Isn't What It Used To Be by Marc Mancini Until 1982, no one knew what to call Syd Mead. A futurist? A forecaster? An oracle? His bold, visionary artwork had long glorified the advertising of Honda, Chrysler, and General Electric, and, in some cases, shaped corporate thinking. With his designs for Star Trek , Tron , and 2010, Mead became a prophet with honor in Hollywood as well. So, director Ridley Scott - for whom Mead created the remarkable, dense imagery of Blade Run- ner-designated Mead a "conceptualist," and the title has stuck. The phrasing of Meads movie credit may be new, but the idea behind it is not. The picture business has long known that we are passionately curious about that foreign destination of ours, the future. So to validate their travelogues of speculation- to make sure that what we see as we peek ahead is believable, even probable- filmmakers have repeatedly tapped into the visions of industrial illus- M/ff f taatim..</page><page sequence="2">Menzies set for Things to Come and trators like Mead, as well as those of social futurists, space scientists, eco- nomic forecasters and science-fiction writers. No matter that the facts some- times get a little jumbled. With the right intentions, directors and their imagina- tive experts give us something far more credible than what tea leaves, eschatol- ogy, or the National Enquirer provide. Indeed, their cinematic predictions have generally been everything a moviegoer could ask for: sensible, well-informed, stirring, even praiseworthy. And they have almost always been wrong. We now live in the future that some long-gone filmmaker could only dream about. As such, we have the smug luxury to sift out those rare prophecies that actu- ally did hit the mark. The Greatest Power (1917) described a super-explosive, exonite, whose effect- even on interna- tional affairs- was not unlike that of the atom bomb. Destination Moon (1950) and When Worlds Collide (1951) both postulated rocketry underwritten by pri- vate enterprise, and that seems to be coming to pass. Spaceways (1952) pro- posed the outrageous idea of disposing dead bodies in space; for $3,900 Celes- tis, a Florida company, will now gladly put your loved ones ashes in a 1,900-mile- high orbit. And then there is the eerie accuracy of Jules Verne, whose story of a moon launch from Florida has been refashioned for the cinema over and over again. One way that a movie conjecture can ensure its own accuracy is by affecting the future itself. A small example: the launch countdown. Fritz Lang claimed to have invented this dramatic practice for his Die Frau Im Mond (1928), and rocketeers have been imitating it ever since. Also, it seems plausible that the "flying wings" of Things to Come (1936) and of Dick Tracy (1937) - or at least the prototype they were based on- encouraged a similarly designed aircraft at Northrup that, a dec- ade later, actually flew. There are other gizmos that became real, like Buck Rogers' flying backpack, Dick Tracy's wrist TV, and the non-anthropomorphic robots of Silent Running. No matter that the movies lifted these ideas from Rand D drawing boards. Their physical incar- nation on the screen challenged research- ers to build the darned things, no matter how expensive or impractical they might be. Yet it's almost an axiom that any sci-fi- ish thing the military recreates proves useless. Take heed, "Star Wars" defen- sers, as you tap into the glorified haze that surrounds George Lucas epic. Movies likewise act as avatars of archi- tecture and design. Model cities, like the one in Just Imagine (1931), made Rockefeller Center seem an idea whose time had come. Ditto for the glass-tubed elevators and lofty, curving atriums of Things to Come , which have reincarnated as the neo-deco hotel lobbies of John Portman. And take note of the modular cabin walls that envelop you as you now jet from place to place. Then check out the spaceship interiors in 2001, whose then-daring configurations came at a time when an aircraft cabin still looked like the inside of a culvert, with daisies pasted on. For every accurate prediction, though, there have been a dozen pratfalls. Both George Méliès (Trip to the Moon) and H. G. Wells (Things to Come) hurled their astronauts into space via immense guns. Wells, especially, should have known better: The occupants would have been squashed. (Unbelievably, the U.S. Army did consider building a giant gun to lob unmanned satellites into orbit, another example of invention imitating art.) "Pic- ture-phones" were routine domestic appliances in futuristic-movie homes, yet only Just Imagine stopped to think what havoc such devices could wreak- sup- pose you had to dress up every time the phone rang. And we still dont have Woody Allen's Orgasmatron or Ursula Andress' shooting bra. Win some, lose some. • So the future isn't what it used to be. Old futuristic visions have become leg- end or joke, not fact. The reason: For- ward-looking movies are, like all artifacts of prophecy, deeply rooted to the soil of their times. Ecology seems endangered? Make Silent Running. Think we'll run out of fuel? Show the consequences in The Road Warrior. Worried about urban crime? Turn New York into a maximum security prison. What about world food shortages? Then prepare for Soylent Green. Such futuristic sermons, of course, serve a useful, vital function, magnifying our concerns and helping to redirect omi- nous possibilities. "I don't try to predict the future," Ray Bradbury reminds us, "I try to prevent it." The future is, after all, the one part of our lives we can change. But history takes rather goofy turns. A hundred years from now some of our wor- ries may seem trivial, incomprehensible, even laughable, like some 19th-century theorist projecting that mounds of dung would surely bury the overpopulated, overhorsed city of the future. And since futurism has been a posture of the media for a century now, some predictions have already aged mightily. A visit to "Yester- day's Tomorrows," a superb exhibit now wending its way through our nation's museums, is proof enough. Its automo- bile prototypes, house models, and Space Patrol costumes make us sense times past, not present or future. The notion of false futures and mixed times has become a cinematic leitmotif. It dominates 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and Master of the World, all films with bogus, nostalgic technologies. It surfaces in Streets of Fire and Buckaroo Bonzai, where you can't tell when you are past, future or substitute present. It especially dominates Michael Radford's new ver- sion of 1984, filmed last year during the period of months that frame the novel's action. Ironically, Orwell wanted to call his book 1948 and present his readers with a reality alternate to that of their own times. But his publishers prevailed, and its allegorical design flipped into a pro- phetic warning. Radford could have revived and updated Orwell's original intent, an alter- native vision of the Eighties, with crowds gathering in the Astrodome to watch some power-hungry cultist aggrandizing himself on Astrovision. But Radford 12</page><page sequence="3">The Bonaventure Hotel in L.A. instead chose to make a film that crawls out from under post-World War II rub- ble-to imagine what filmmakers might have done with Orwell's material then. Certainly 1984 proffers the big screen TVs that have become common today, but they are strangely shaped and display Pathé-like newsreel montages. Yes, there are computer-like work stations, but they're networked through black dial phones and mail tubes. There's even so little color in 1984 s art design that you feel you're watching an old black-and- white film. This false sense of a past's future sets off rather strange harmonics. It makes one feel happy that mankind has not come to this; even communism has not evolved to the extremes depicted. It also makes one wonder what seeds of Orwell's vision continue to germinate. Beyond its bleak, deadly seriousness, 1984 reminds us how vital yet treacherous a look into the future can be. • In his book Profiles of the Future Arthur C. Clarke explains why predic- tions go astray: failures of nerve, says he, and failures of imagination. But the film- making industry, whose very success is predicated on anticipating trends, has never had very much trouble with imagi- nation or nerve. When the cinema rejects facts, it is not out of too little imagination or nerve, but too much. Current filmmakers are more respect- ful of scientific truth than their predeces- sors, but they too will discard fact when convenient - to this day few dare show spacecraft that don't go woosh in the silent vacuum of space. Consultants sometimes help. For Die Frau Im Mond , two young scientists shored up Thea von Harbou's story of an engineer and a pro- fessor who build a moon rocket. Even in 1928 the consultants, Herman Oberth and Willy Ley, knew what they were talk- ing about: Their vehicle is a multistage rocket that tracks out from a hangar to its pad. So similar was it to what would become the V-2 - designed in part by Oberth and Ley- that Hitler eventually had all prints of the film confiscated as "secret material." The failures of film prophecy, however, demand explanations specific to the medium. Two new categories should take their place alongside those of Clarke: The Failure of Practicality: The real world eventually sifts out the prag- matic from the unfeasible. Celluloid worlds don't. Just Imagine may suggest helicopters for everyone, The Day the Earth Stood Still nuclear vehicles, Blade Runner a huddle of megastructures, and 2010 two suns in the sky. But what would happen when Fred Future, tired from the spasmodic daylight that disturbs his sleep pattern, rammed his personal, nuclear- powered copter into the side of a 300- story building? When Frank Lloyd Wright proposed a mile-high skyscraper for Chicago and Buckminster Fuller wanted to dome Manhattan, civic leaders applauded these bold visions, and said no. Hollywood would have said yes, as long as the scale was 100 feet to one inch. The flip side to this is how unexpected developments have rendered perfectly sensible cinematic predictions impracti- cal. Ocean-liner-sized dirigibles were a charming idea, until the Hindenberg. Méliès' Channel Tunnel seemed useful before the Hovercraft was built. The mid- Atlantic floating aerodrome from FPI Does Not Answer was a convenient con- cept, until the ocean-hopping jet came along. And who knows what made the monorail depicted in Fahrenheit 451 an idea whose time never really did come? The Inconsistency of Style: Noth- ing dates a futuristic movie faster than padded shoulders, pompadour haircuts, or bell-bottomed spacesuits. Styles, after all, change more frequently than the win- dow mannequin in George Pal's The Time Machine . Some costumers, aware that old styles always return, try to free their designs from contemporary tastes by rummaging through period clothing racks, but the results are almost always tacky. As for furniture, art decorators think it's enough to buy the latest expensive, con- temporary bric-a-brac to prop their avant- garde décor. More likely, the glass and marble dining table in 2010 will be in a Goodwill store before the decade is out. The designer fashions from Soylent Green already are. To assume that the future will look completely different is a more grievous sin. A 19th-century Englishman would not be unduly disoriented by modern-day London; barring nuclear holocaust, the 21st century would probably be suffi- ciently familiar to us. The 1955 version of 1984 validated its aerial views of London by simply superimposing a few odd domes over the familiar skyline, and it worked. Dark Star carried us into its lunatic world by showing spaceship quar- ters plastered with Playboy centerfolds and defaced by graffiti, and the space sta- tion in Solaris is just as much a mess. 2001 reinforced its credibility by propel- ling Pan Am and Howard Johnson into space; this near-certain commercializa- tion of the next frontier had been curi- ously absent from other films. And Alphaville appeared futuristic not because of any extravagant sets or props but because Jean-Luc Godard and his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, dis- torted their contemporary Paris into uncharacteristic, disorienting bleakness. Such conceptualists as Syd Mead and Graham Walker (The Road Warrior) have given such juxtapositions of the familiar and the strange a very contemporary twist. Mead calls it "retrofitted utiliza- tion." It can be seen throughout the back- sliding worlds of Blade Runner and The Road Warrior. Explains Mead, "In many Third World countries you'll find older vehicles, some dating back to the Thir- ties and Forties, that have air condi- tioners on top, large batteries and generators, mud-flaps, and hang-on fix- tures.... They've taken on a style of their own." If the sleek, smooth rocket or sau- cer marked the sci-fi look of the Fifties, and the intricately detailed starship that of the Seventies, then the agglomerated vehicle rolling over a post-apocalyptical landscape is surely the dominant futuris- tic image of our age. • For a long time, post-technological bar- barism was hardly the norm in futuristic 13</page><page sequence="4">Blade Runner (left) and 1984 (right). Anticipating trends or preventing them? films. Especially from the Twenties up to August 6, 1945, much of the world believed that a scientific and architectural utopia was imminent. First outlined in fin-de-siecle novels, magazines, and newspapers, later sanctified by the Futurist artists of Italy, and finally freed from the counterbalancing Victorian pes- simism by the very momentum of techno- logical change, the ideal of a scientific utopia hung on through the Depression, a fizzy wish-fulfillment for would-be con- sumers. "Hobby" magazines, like Pop- ular Mechanics , showed America the marvels that were just around the corner. (Hugo Gernsback, who coined the term "science fiction," began as a publisher of such magazines.) Pulps, radio, and mati- nee serials popularized Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. Corporations linked them- selves to the grand future: Du Pont touted stores in which "merchandise would move past shoppers"; Oldsmobile hitched its logo to a rocket; Detroit prom- ised us a Ford in our future; and in 1956 Madison Avenue (actually copywriter Davis Grubb, who wrote The Night of the Hunter) proudly announced, "Suddenly it's I960." Even buildings were stream- lined, as if they were about to uproot and fly. - The apotheosis of Utopian thinking was the 1939 New York World's Fair, where virtually every American corpora- tion felt compelled to launch visitors into the future. At the Transportation Exhibit was a rocketport, in the Hall of Pharmacy a "Soda Fountain of the Future," and at Borden's pavilion a revolving "rotolactor" automatically milked 150 contented cows. There were also two ambitious examples of future urban landscapes: Democracity, housed in the Perisphere theme building, and Futurama, a vast, jokingly prophetic model of the Ameri- can metropolis of 1960 that had been designed by Norman Bel Geddes, one of the era's most skilled conceptualists. Even the impending war, the fair implied, would not get in the way of progress. 4&lt;We're coming into a new world," prom- ised Chaplin a year later in The Great Dictator, and America wanted desper- ately to believe it. But nearly two decades before the World's Fair opening, Fritz Lang had vis- ited New York and found his city of the future without ever going to Flushing Meadows. As he later declared, the Man- hattan skyline apparently provided him with an almost spiritual moment; the world of his day had no other cities so dense and vertical. His enthusiasm translated fluently to the screen only a few years later: The views of his Metrop- olis are the most distinctive element of what is basically a stock tale that blends dialectics with the gothic. Paradoxically, Metropolis ' set draws from two opposing traditions: that of the early 20th-century illustrators, who depicted future cities as things complicated and cluttered, and that of the Bauhaus, which trusted that modern design could ultimately lift the human spirit. Lang's message is equally mixed. Metropolis ì de-souled, mechanistic soci- ety is offset by the soaring views of its architecture - there's every reason to believe that Lang and von Harbou figured that Metropolis ' subterranean oppressed could do nothing better than to rise into their city's grandiose structures. Tellingly, the film's villain, Rotwang, dabbles less in science than in magic and lives not in a skyscraper but in a thatched hut that has resisted the intrusion of modernity. Utopian visions are more explicitly central to the two great "city of the future" movies of the Thirties, Just Imagine and Things to Come. Yet no two films could have more different tones. On a superfi- cial level (and most of this film is superfi- cial), Just Imagine derides progressive thinking, turning the future into a bad joke: test-tube babies out of automats, pills for food and drink, flying cars that are stopped for speeding, even a Martian with pointed hair and studded leather garb who would look at home in a Billy Idol video. Behind the film's ludicrous story line and inept acting, however, is a set so memorable and achieved that it actually counters any satiric intent that Just Imagine might have entertained. Its New York-1980 miniature cost $250,000, filled a blimp hangar, and drew inspiration from the conceptual work of Hugh Ferriss, whose drawings of monumental paradigms of future architecture dra- matized much of the era's advertising. William Cameron Menzie's set for the much more serious Things to Come is a triumph of art-deco style, a perfect cor- 14</page><page sequence="5">The distant past? 2010. The not-so-distant future ? relative for H. G. Wells faith in benevo- lent technocracies. Other futuristic Erewhons sit squarely in the midst of the Thirties' motion pic- ture mythology: the sublime slabs of Lost Horizon's Shangri-La, the silly towers of the Phantom Empires Murania (under Gene Autry's ranch, no less), and, of course, the sleek emerald domes of Oz. But Dorothy brushed aside Utopian visions to return to the serenity of Kansas. And in 1983, The Day After blew it up. • Hiroshima put an end to romantic visions of the future. Why moon over cit- ies of tomorrow, when tomorrow might flatten them? Instantly, cinematic conjec- ture went from persuasion to dissuasion, from a firm, exhortorial faith in progress to a Luddite fear of its black mischief. So traumatic was it all that at first filmmakers avoided showing a future nuclear catas- trophe, preferring to embody their fears in assorted giants, beasts, and blobs - all spawned by radiation, of course. The very few early depictions of nuclear destruction, like Five (1951), Captive Women (1953), and The Day the World Ended (1955), were cheaply made and poorly received. Only with On the Beach did maturity come to the genre. And even in those rare futuristic societies not rent by nuclear holocaust, the outlook was hardly cheerful. A Clockwork Orange's society bears only a few affinities with that foreseen by Wells, but it does with our present - a chilling concept with which 7 ime After Time plays quite clev- erly. No, the past few decades have done little to belie Dystopia. So, cinematic "wonder" cities have been a rarity. Logan's Run, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century , and several episodes of TVs Star Trek do feature impressive techno-towns. But they are populated by naive, myopic aesthetes and are sur- rounded by vast, ruined landscapes - a metaphor for the current attitude toward the Utopian city itself and one paralleled, as writer H. Bruce Franklin points out, by the gleaming commercial towers that rise above our squalid inner cities, or better, by the stagnant prototypes of Brasilia and Arcosanti. At least The Empire Strikes Back's Vespin is sublime, yet tellingly George Lucas placed it, and his whole saga, in a distant past, not our future. Star Trek , certain Japanese and Soviet movies, and a few Saturday morning kidvids are the only remaining bastions of a progres- sive, harmonious tomorrow. More alarmingly, films like The Road Warrior and The Terminator posit a world in regression, where nuclear war and its entropie aftermath are taken for granted. On the one hand, our attraction to such landscapes share common ground with humanity's strange, long-standing fasci- nation with ruins, a sort of cultural equiv- alent for what animals must feel when they nose about the bones of their own kind. On the other, it may mean that we have already given up. There is one con- solation. Like every other cinematic vision of the future, this one too may be false, or cause it to be false. The future as moral dissuader has become a powerful cinematic convention. Yet there are already signs that we may be ready to swing back to Utopian dreams. More intensely than at any other time since the Thirties, advertising is intensely allying itself to the future: Hyatt shuttles us to a hotel in space; Apple and Pacific Bell (with Frank Herbert as spokesman) promise us that the Orwell- ian vision will never be. The last time this happened, the movies quickly tagged along. Further, we have managed for 40 years not to blow ourselves up. Arms control seems more likely. And though the "robot apartments" about which Allen Ginsberg howled have materialized, we appear none the worse for it. As the Sec- ond Millennium approaches, we seem already to be making optimistic resolu- tions for the Ultimate New Year. Even extraterrestrials dont appear to be worried. Unlike The Day the Earth Stood Still's alien-ex-machina, most of today's otherworlders seem not con- cerned about our nuclear problems at all. So why are they coming to our screens in droves? Maybe for the obverse reason of their noisome predecessors. Just as the Fifties camouflaged its fears as churlish, menacing aliens, so now might the Eighties be shaping its hopes into gra- cious starmen, mermaids, and ETs. The aliens of Close Encounters even fly to Earth in their own jukebox city of tomor- row. The future - someone else's, for now - is visiting us, and it's friendly. Per- haps our own is not too far behind. @ 15</page></plain_text>
