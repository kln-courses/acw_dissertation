<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY history. At the same time he doubts here the interpretative value of cold logical categories-One, Many, All (as when the relations of Eastern Despotism, Greek Aristocracy and Democracy, and Germanic Monarchy are explained by reference to the "one," the "some," the "all," who are conscious of freedom under these systems), or again of Insichseyn and Fiirsichseyn (as when Buddhism is defined as the religion of the former). If we ask "How then is the unity of history to be apprehended ?" it is natural to answer that a rudimentary apprehension of the unity is already present whenever long periods are seen as a connected story. Whenever we let our minds run rapidly over the events of centuries-whether e.g. we do this in the disjointed manner in which the author of the Golden Legend' gives us the history of Europe from the sixth century to the thirteenth, or in the more connected style in which in Paradiso (Canto VI)2 Justinian recounts the history of Roman rule from LEneas to Charlemagne-our interest in such summary treatment implies a perception of some connecting bond. History has become an Epic. In the words of Professor Freeman, "the whole story, from the beginning to our own time, forms one tale." The analogy of the Epic (if it is not a false analogy) suggests that historical knowledge, if it became complete, would have an a priori as well as an a posteriori aspect; that while such complete- ness involves on the one hand the activity of sense and memory enjoying and recording the changing scenes, it must require on the other hand an activity of thought like that of the creative artist. For such thought Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, are "pages in the book to show" how by a necessity-analogous to the aesthetic necessity which prescribes to a poem its true development-the self-actuating Idea must reflect itself in history. Is this unity, then, real or imaginary? No one can be quite indifferent to the question, and we can all of us in some measure put it to the test. If a reader begins, say, with such a framework or sketch as Professor Freeman provides in some of his smaller books, does the unity of history become clearer or less clear as he advances in knowledge of the details ? The analogy of the Epic suggests (whatever answer we give to the question just asked) that Professor Barker's studies in civilization, ancient, mediaeval, and modern, may give us the same kind of assistance to the understanding of human history as good Homeric or Shakesperian criticism affords for the wise reading of Homer or Shakespeare. The method which Professor Barker's historical studies suggest to the philosopher is thus in some respects not quite Hegelian. It is perhaps none the less well fitted to enforce the real lesson of Hegel. Professor Barker gives a timely warning against the thoughtless and unselective accumulation of mere detail which is sometimes covered by the word "research."3 In the handling of detail he is himself an example to every writer of history. Indeed, it is hard to conceive the student, or even the man of general education, who will not reap a rich reward from the study of Professor Barker's pages. C. J. SHEBBEARE. The Interpretation of Development and Heredity. A Study in Biological Method. By E. S. RUSSELL, O.B.E., D.Sc. (Oxford: The Clarendon Press. I930. Pp. 312. Price I5s. net.) Dr. Russell describes his book as a "study in biological method," but it is much more than this. It is a historical summary of the conceptions that have been held with regard to the nature of the process of organic develop- " Under the heading "History of St. Pelagius." 2 Paradiso, VI. 34-96. 3 P. 227. 252</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS ment, or ontogeny (and it may usefully be supplemented by the reading of a recent book by Professor Cole on Early Theories of Sexual Generation, where there is much that is quaint and curious on the matter). Dr. Russell's book is also critical, but constructive too, when he works out his organismal conception of development, and it is a well-balanced and judicial survey of what he calls a major problem in biology. There have always been two contrasted attitudes with regard to the nature of the process whereby the ovum, or other germinal unit, becomes the fully developed organism. In the past, and at present, many biologists have seen in the ovum, or spermatozoon, something that contained, in miniature, or latent, or potentially, or involved, that which evolved into the specific animal body. This was the notion of "preformation." Others have believed that in the ontogeny there was something that was not in the germ, that grew up upon the germ. This was the notion of "epigenesis." But since two ova of related species A and B develop into the animals A and B, even though those ova are habitant in precisely the same physical environment, it appears that specifically different reasons inhere in the ova why they become A and B. Therefore there is, if not an actual preformation of the adult structures, at least an involution of those structures. The " external factors" of the environment do not evoke those structures in their specificities. What then is the developmental agency that we appear to be obliged to postulate? In his valuable chapter on the "Misuse of Abstraction" Dr. Russell traces out the growths of the attitudes taken by embryologists with regard to this problem. Workers on the physiological side may study the effect of tem- perature, of the chemistry of the nutritive medium, of operative interference with the embryo, etc., and it has thus happened that they have extended the notions of their methods to their conceptions of the agency. Therefore we have the physical-chemical hypotheses of development, or, comparing the process with the acquirement and establishment of a habit by an animal, a psychical or mnemic hypothesis has been the result. Or, again, by extending the scope of the morphological method of biology to visible and invisible structural units within the germ-cell nucleus, we have the modern, "par- ticulate" conception that comes from the study of genetics. These are examples of current ontogenetic hypotheses, and of the misuse of the method of abstraction. Dr. Russell's "organismal" view may be summarized: The ovum about to develop is an organism; the developing embryo is a creature that assimilates and which may be irritable, mobile, predatory, and reproductive-it is all that an organism (in the ordinary sense) may be; it is a functional unity, and this unity is expressed in the activities of maintenance, growth, and reproduction; in it the functional activities are influenced by the past-by the ancestral experience; in it the functional activities cannot be understood (and certainly cannot be described) without reference to the future, or end, of the developmental process; it is not a sum of parts, for the parts must be integrated-just as erroneously should we call a multitude of minute straight lines laid together, end by end, in a certain way, a curve, for that which generates the curve is a mathematical function; the organism endures, in Bergson's sense; it is something dynamic, and not static (as suggested in the "stages" of the embryologist). The most striking thing about a developmental process is its tectonic activity. The embryo assimilates nutritive materials, and may behave as if it had perceptions, and it reproduces cells. But it assembles those cells as the specific organ-rudiments, and it differentiates, or shapes, them as tissue- elements-bone-cells, muscle-cells, nerve-cells, etc. This is what particularly 253</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY interests us in an embryogeny. What is the assembling agency? We have the clearest and most immediate intuition of its nature in our own minds as artisans, writers, painters, composers, etc. This psycho-biological conception of development has been called "anthropomorphic," and it is suspect by the physiology of our time. Why it should be suspect is a curious study, and that the naive notions of a "material basis of inheritance," of "carriers of hereditary qualities," or of "organ-forming substances," should still persist and be re- garded as orthodox, marks an extraordinary phase in biology. Over and over again this "anthropomorphic" view of the developmental process has recurred. We find it clearly expressed by Oken (in I805). The ovum is an entire animal in idea and design only, but not in structure. In it the animal resides as an impalpable spectre, and not as a corporeal miniature. The ovum is related to the animal which it becomes as the thought is to the word. A similar view was formulated by Driesch (although Dr. Russell thinks that he spoiled it by the application of the Aristotelian conception of a morphogenetic entelechy). It was the view taken by Samuel Butler and Hering, and (with a physical extension) by Semon. Clearly the notion has persistence, so that biologists have been driven to it again and again in spite of the success of the methods of experimental embryology, and clearly because of the enormous difficulties of purely physical hypotheses. For such physical and chemical notions always include the conception of increasing randomness. If there are chemical physical processes that go on of themselves, each successive phase of the process must be represented by an assemblage of parts that is more random than the last one. Only when physical-chemical processes are coupled may this law of increasing randomness be reversed; but if there are coupled processes in a developmental career, then it is the coupling agency that has to be explained. In an embryogeny the physical-chemical system assumes, in a regular succession, a series of highly specific configura- tions, with increase of available energy and entropy decrease, and it is quite conceivable that all this may happen, of itself, at random, and without any coupling agencies that are external to the system. But the improbability of all this is incredibly great. Let us suppose that the stones, bricks, mortar, etc., that are the materials necessary for the construction of a house be dumped, at random, upon the ground where the house is to stand, and suppose that, of themselves, these materials fell together in the form of the house. The improbability of such a "fortuitous concourse" of materials would be comparable with that of the embryogeny that would occur purely by physico- chemical processes. Such an improbability is incredibly small (it has been found to be of the same order of magnitude as that of all the houses in London catching fire independently of each other, or "by accident," on the same day, or of all the inhabitants of London committing suicide, also indepen- dently of each other). Improbable events like these are therefore to be compared with our experience that millions of developmental processes are being completed in every minute fraction of a second. Surely the conclusion is an obvious one-that a developmental process does not occur at random. And, returning to the analogy of a building operation, it is quite conceiv- able that observers on, say, the moon might be puzzled how to describe the agencies involved in a great building and might not deduce organismal ones. Yet we know that mentality is the assembling agency concerned. In considering development, most of the other great problems of Diology are implied. Heredity simply means that the developmental process by which an ovum became the parent is similar to the process by which the egg borne by the parent becomes the offspring. Modern genetics simply studies minute (and often trivial, or pathological) differences in the developmental process 254</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS of the germ-cells reproduced by organisms that conjugate sexually. Evolution means that the developmental process may be a little different in the egg borne by the parent from the process in the egg borne by the offspring. And so on. Wherever biology has speculative interest, and in all those fields where it makes strong appeal to the non-technical reader, the problems of organic development are implied. To such readers Dr. Russell's book will be as a "feast of richness," not only because of its materials, but also from its critical- constructive discussions, and because of its methodological interest. Biology is still a young and naive science, for the wealth of its data far surpasses that of the physical sciences (or at least of the science that considers only the things that we call inorganic). These data are still woefully incomplete, and while this is so biology may remain largely intuitional in its methods. But books such as this one (and Dr. Woodger's Biological Principles) make a good beginning in the construction of a logic of biology. From this point of view alone Dr. Russell's book is strongly to be commended. JAS. JOHNSTONE. Creative Mind. By C. SPEARMAN, Ph.D., LL.D., F.R.S. (London: Nisbet &amp; Co., Ltd.; Cambridge: The University Press. I930. Pp. xii + I53. Price 5s. net.) This volume is the first of a new series entitled "The Contemporary Library of Psychology," to be published under the editorship of Dr. F. Aveling. The series is described as being planned "with a view to presenting the problems of Psychology in a popular way, but at the same time without any loss of scientific accuracy." If the work under review may be taken as representa- tive of the standard to be maintained, it is evident that the editor and his Advisory Board have a solid respect for the general reader. The popular appeal has not entailed writing down, for while Professor Spearman has done much to make his little book attractive, it is by no means light reading; and being a development rather than a re-statement of his distinctive theories of mental process, it should fulfil the editor's aim in being of service to students and general reader alike. The book is copiously illustrated by reproductions (small but clear) of well-known pictures, and is in all respects admirably produced. The series should meet with a warm welcome. Professor Spearman brings his noegenetic principles to bear upon the psy- chological problems presented by creative activity in the arts, in behaviour, and in science and philosophy. The territory surveyed is too extensive to be adequately explored in a book of this size, and it would have been better had the author limited himself to the topics of the earlier chapters in order to develop his thesis more thoroughly. In particular, we could have dispensed with the chapter headed "Behaviour" (though actually dealing with certain tests of reasoning). The argument is most adequately presented in the chapters on pictorial art. Its outcome is that "the final act in creativity must be assigned to the third noegenetic process; that of displacing a relation from the ideas which were its original fundaments to another idea, and thereby generating the further idea which is correlative to the last named, and which may be entirely novel" (p. 77). The other cognitive principles, quantitative as well as quali- tative, together with emotion, though no less essential to the process of artistic creation, are subordinate to that which creates the material of the work of art. We would suggest here that the quantitative principles are the basis of selective criticism of the material provided by the eduction of correlates, 255</page></plain_text>
