<plain_text><page sequence="1">ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY August 27, 1977 Ananda K Coomaraswamy V Subramaniam IN this centenary year of the birth of Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy, it would be useful to evaluate the im- pact the great man had at a popular and at a sophisticated level on Wester- ners as well as Indians. In a visible way, the impact has been dramatic. Around the turn of the century very few outside South India had seen a bronze icon of the dancing Shiva - Nataraja - or had taken any interest in it. But the cumulative impact of Coomaraswamy's famous article, 'The Dance of Shiva', has been such that in the most unlikely American television programmes one now finds the bronze image of the dancing Shiva shown in fashionable drawing rooms. Indeed, this bronze icon has now become the symbol of culture and connoisseurship in India as well as in fashionable In- dophile homes in the West. Its popu- larity can also be judged by the grue- some fact that it is now cast and made available in almost every state capital of North India by curio-sellers and even by the Tibetan refugees in Janpath, New Delhi. Judged by the standard of the widespread demand for Nataraja icons, Coomaraswamy can be said to have had a greater impact on popular taste than probably any Western art critic in the last 100 years. He has been successful in another sense too, particularly in the West. There is far greater interest in the study of Indian art in Western univer- sities than in India; there are more teachers of Indian art per thousand university students in the US or Wes- tern Europe than in India. On the other hand his efforts to lift the Indian and Ceylonese bourgeoi- sie from the quagmire of degraded taste for tawdry Western things have been far less successful. It is true that the middle class Indian homes do not have those glossy calendar pictures of Western scenes of hill and dale or bacchanalian revelry which once adorn- ed those walls; but these have been replaced by a taste for imported elec- trical goods. Moreover, the taste for cheap anthropomorphic representations of various gods in calendars and in glossy prints has, if anything, multip- lied thousand-fold with the growth of litho-printing. To Coomaraswamy, who poured out such strong, if somewhat unfair, criticism on Ravi Varma's paintings, this nemesis of lithography into glossy calendar imagery must be galling. But one can hardly expect Coomaraswamy or any human being to revolutionise popular taste in a few decades. At a more sophisticated level he is now regarded by Western scholars in art history as the equal of Tagore and Gandhi as a maker of the Indian renaissance, and as the equal of Freud or Croce in creating new norms in the enjoyment of art. Indeed, no uni- versity department of religion or art history in the West can afford to for- get his works and no library can exist without a collection of them. Of course his influence at a popu- lar level penetrated slowly down with- out people ever realising that he was the one who rediscovered the greater glory of Nataraja. In fact it was the Western recognition of the beauty of the image that fired the South Indian worshippers with a new zeal. The im- perial art buccaneers of the last cen- tury and the art thieves of this cen- tury spread the glory of Nataraja in 'the West, thus leading to a recogni- tion of its prestige value and hence the acquisition of second rate Nata- raja icons by a number of Western educated Indianst. This was naturally followed by the usual mass manufac- ture of the icon in various parts of India by curio sellers who had never heard of the name of Ananda Cooma- raswamy. But applying his own dic- tum from Sukraneethi, that an ugly icon made according to Agamic speci- fications still conveys its message, the whole process of popularisation cannot be said to have been wasted. The bulk and range of his intense- ly scholarly writing is again something to be proud of, and yet there is one other effect which he produced on the West which has had a dubious value. 1 refer to Coomaraswamy's association of religion and Indian art in all his writing and his insistence that Euro- pean art at its best, viz, pre-Renais- sance art, was equally religious. Com- ing at a time in the first two decades of this century when Indian spiritua- lity was being aggressively broadcast to the West by Vivekananda and later by Tagore, this view was not always correctly understood. There were of course scholars who understood the sophisticated sense in which Cooma- raswamy associated religion and art and who would correct his exaggerat- ed emphasis in due course. But the substantial number of Westerners who turned to India after being disappoint- ed with Western industrial civilisation were made of less stern stuff. One finds this particularly in Western mis- appreciation of Indian classical music; one thinks of those who come to listen to a sitar or veena performance for its 'soothing' effect rather than with a view to understanding the intricacies of the Ragas, and who use the term 'improvisation' to cover everything they do not understand. Again Coomara- swamy's expectations of elevating artistic taste by associating it with religion would receive a rude shock if he were to look at the pictures of Krishna Leela in the glossy editions of Bhagavata Purana litho-produced by the Hare Krishna group in Japan for sale in the West. In India itself what has been his lasting effect? Unfortunately his ap- peal to a limited and sensitive audi- ence was submerged by the Gandhian call for austerity. He had to wait till the late 30s for his influence to be felt outside Bengal. In his own land his impact was even feebler. A telling proof of this is the fact that as late as 1950, two years after the independ- ence of Ceylon, the Jaffna Municipal Library did not have a portrait of Coomaraswamy but had those of George VI and Queen Mary. Pro- bably the best measure of his influ- ence on political leaders is the fact that Jawaharlal Nehru once had to lecture to Congress parliamentarians on the artistic quality of Satish Guiral's painting of Lajpat Rai in order to overcome the aversion of the MPs for non-photographic impressionistic art; and that Morarji Desai recently suggested the name of Rukmini Devi, the reviver of classical Indian dance, for the Presidentship of India.
