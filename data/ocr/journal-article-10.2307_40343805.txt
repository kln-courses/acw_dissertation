<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renovating Bhairav: Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu Michael C. Baltutis In 2003, the extensive renovations being made to the Akas Bhairav temple in the Indra Chowk neighborhood of Kathmandu 's old city drew to a close. Though the temple had been renovated several times in the twentieth century, this most recent renovation was the most thorough in nearly sixty years.1 The ultimate goal of this renovation was not simply the replacement of worn-out building materials and the updating of the temple's infrastructure, however, but the returning of the temple to a more traditional appearance. Thus, in addition to replacing rotten and termite-eaten wooden beams and windows, decrepit bricks, and dried-out mortar, and installing electricity and a new water tank for bathing, the temple's aesthetic renovation was most clearly facilitated through the removal of the variously colored glossy ceramic tiles that were added to its fa$ade - and to the fa9ades of many other local temples and shrines nearly a century ago - and their replacement with more traditional red bricks.2 Upon the completion of the renovation, the Sri Akas Bhairavanath Mandir Jlrnoddhar Samiti (Akas Bhairavnath Temple Renovation Committee; hereafter TRC) issued a commemorative volume of essays - a smdrikd, or "remembrance" - a sort of Festschrift for the temple, which they distributed to many of the project's donors, whose names and donations fill the final forty pages of the hundred-plus page book. The text focuses on Akas Bhairav, the deity who sits on the second floor of this oft- visited temple and on the functional role that both the deity and the temple play in the larger community. Throughout the book, Bhairav' s praises are sung in many tongues, his rituals and festivals are recalled, the renovation of his temple is described, and his unique story is narrated. It is this final element, the text's various narrations of Bhairav's local biography that will comprise the greater portion of this article. This narrative of the Nepalese apotheosis and enshrinement of Akas Bhairav is hardly a "universal" Hindu myth related in some epic or Purana, however. Rather, it purports to begin in classical Newar language Vamsavall texts; it connects to ostensibly Hindu religious rituals and festivals performed throughout the subcontinent; and it concludes with the very construction of this temple in the early history of Kathmandu. And this renovation International Journal of Hindu Studies 13, 1: 25-49 Â© 2009 Springer DOI 10. 1007/sl 1407-009-9068-1</page><page sequence="2">26 / Michael C. Baltutis serves as more than the simple repair of an old temple, more than an architectural metaphor for the apotheosis of the deity, and more than an act of resistance against the dominant Hindu kingdom of Nepal: the renovation of this temple and the subse- quent publication of this collection of essays together serve as a practical device for the reestablishment both of an ethnically Newar lineage3 and of an ethnically Newar deity in a neighborhood frequently stated by Kathmandu's residents to be the very center of the city.4 These two constructions are not, however, simply the result of the activities of the Newars as a whole, but rather represent the joint responsibility of the Newar Jyapu caste members of Indra Chowk and the locally enshrined deity Akas Bhairav. In positing this joint responsibility, I am asserting a coagency that binds Bhairav to these human agents. In asserting this contiguity between the human and the divine, I am following Diane P. Mines and her "pragmatic" theorizing about the agency of the gods of the village of Yanaimangalam in Tamilnadu. Mines asserts that when gods are seen as "tools for human action in the world [and as] conduits for practical human activity" (2005: 18), when gods and humans are viewed as "materially linked parts of one another" (138), and when each is seen as standing in an indexical rela- tion of "part to a whole" (141), the question of the "reality" of the gods and the apparent contradiction between the agentive and merely mythical power of the gods disappears. Mines states: Gods are not merely symbols that stand for relations among humans, echoing frozen and unitary ideational structures whose origins are mysterious... .[Rather], the gods are real powers contiguous with humans, powers that make humans into powerful agents with the capacity to potentially restructure the system of conven- tional rankings that may exist at any given moment (2005: 144). Whereas a metaphoric relationship between gods and humans relates primarily to "structures," best seen in Louis Dumont's classical Indological works that highlight a pure-impure continuum for both gods and humans, a metonymic relationship is based on "events," on ritual performances in which deities are invoked and instanti- ated. Central to Mines' thesis is the contiguous and metonymic relationship that obtains between the village's relatively powerless inhabitants and its "fierce gods," who, "through their socially disordering powers, allow subordinate groups and persons to publicly turn the tables on domination and assert their own powerful alternatives of village relations" (2005: 5). Mines' conception of the agency of fierce gods in South India recalls Ronald Inden's textual analysis of the construction of the Visnudharmottara Purdna. Inden's historicization of the redaction of this text employs the twin concepts of complex authorship and complex agency, the related notions that texts consist of responses to other authors and are " 'dialogical' moments in the relations that agents... have with themselves and with other agents..." (2000: 11). The articulation of this complex agency is contained in the very texts constructed by authors and redactors,</page><page sequence="3">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu I 27 agents who see themselves "as coagents of the splendid and mighty beings described in the Puranas that could work their will in the world" (Inden 2000: 34). Thus, the construction of texts serves, like the possession rituals that Mines describes, as performative events that allow for, or even require, the coagency of gods and humans. What I will argue in this article is that the authors of the TRC volume operate according to a similar paradigm: being not only local (some say "indigenous") Newar people, but also members of the relatively low Jyapu caste, these authors have as the primary object of their worship the "fierce" Akas Bhairav. Rather than the possession events that mark the intimacy between the fierce gods of Yanaimangalam and their low-caste DhobI dancers and rather than the attempted production of an orthodox epic or Puranic text, these Jyapu devotees of Bhairav have ritualized and publicized their intimacy with Bhairav through the relatively quotidian events of the renovation of his temple and production of the TRC text. More specifically, the Newar authors of this text pin their identities to a renovated and multivalent deity whose fierceness - in both nature and countenance - provides his devotees with a ritual and rhetorical counterpoint to dominant Nepalese and Hindu ideology. Thus the Nepalese Bhairav differs from the many South Asian "demon devotees," such as those described in Alf Hiltebeitel's edited volume, whose "mythologies are shaped by a theology of bhakti, or devotion, in which the gods repeatedly convert their demon adversaries... into their devotees" (1989a: I).5 The Newar authors, on the other hand, perform the rhetorical construction of the protec- tive Bhairav, a construction that provides the foundation for the larger task at hand: the reestablishment of a traditional locus of Newar power, which they accomplish in four related ways. First, narratively, Bhairav' s lineage is made to correspond to that of the pre-Hindu KiratI king Yalambar, whose story intersects with one of the defining moments in the narrative history of classical Hinduism, the Mahabharata War at Kuruksetra in North India. Second, performatively, Bhairav 's narrative and the rituals that recall this narrative are connected to the Indrajatra, the annual autum- nal festival of the Hindu deity Indra, and are asserted to be the area's original and primary celebrations. Third, genealogically, Bhairav's identity is connected to a solely Newar deity, the protective grandfather, Aju. Finally, geopolitically, these authors extend the protective domain of Akas Bhairav: formerly asserted to be simply "the king of Indra Chowk," Bhairav becomes also the protector of the modern nation of Nepal. Following brief introductions to the TRC volume and the historical situation in the Kathmandu Valley in the late eighteenth century, I will describe each of these four Newar responses, providing translations and exegeses of significant portions of the TRC essays. The Akas Bhairavnath Temple Renovation Committee Volume Leafing through the front matter of the TRC volume, we obtain an idea not only of the scope of the volume, but also, and more importantly, of the wide appeal of this particular temple. The front matter includes a series of renovation before-and-after</page><page sequence="4">28 / Michael C. Baltutis photos of the temple exterior and interior; letters of congratulations and good wishes (subhakdmand) from the then prime minister, Suryabahadur Thapa, and from the mayor of Kathmandu, Kesav Sthapit; a letter of appreciation from the headman (adhyaksa) of the TRC, Vikas Bhakta Srestha; half- and full-page advertisements from businesses, both local (for example, Siddhi Vinayak Jewelers from Indra Chowk) and national (for example, Kinetic motorcycles);6 and photos of the members of the four TRC subcommittees. Concluding the front matter and introduc- ing the text proper, and contained on the book's first numbered page, is a black-and- white photo of the temple image of Akas Bhairav accompanied by the lyrics to the Nepali-language Bhairav-stuti, a recorded version of which - sung in the style of a Nepali film song with alternating male and female voices - is played during the Indrajatra festival, as the chariot processions of the living divinities Ganesa, Bhairav, and Kumarl pass by the temple on the full-moon day of the month of Bhadra (see Appendix). The book's primary content, however, is a collection of thirteen essays written by scholars, many of whom are local to the Indra Chowk neighborhood, commemo- rating the completion of the renovation of this most central urban temple. The topics of these articles - nine of which are in Nepali language and four in Newar - include dedicatory essays in honor of Akas Bhairav, descriptions of the regular activities of the temple's guthl organization, as well as explanations of the engineering and economics involved in the renovation process. But approximately half of the thirteen essays focus on the narrative of the fierce Bhairav and serve most clearly to respond to a prior state of hegemony, that of the Hindu Nepalese nation, with a reassertion of the legitimacy of Newar place names, deities, and vocabulary. Thus, before approaching the content of these essays, I will spend some time detailing the histori- cal situation that brought Bhairav into such prominence and that allowed for the production of a text to serve as a salvo in an ongoing "culture war" between the coexisting Newar and Nepali worlds of the city of Kathmandu. The Nepali "Reformation" The historical background for the contemporary significance of Bhairav's narrative is the transition from "medieval" to "modern" Nepal, a dynastic transition effected in 1768-69 with the Nepali Shah (or Gorkhall) conquest of the Kathmandu Valley, and the wresting of political control of the Valley's four largest cities - Kirtipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kathmandu - from the ethnically Newar Malla dynasty. The Shah conquest served as a cultural "moment of crisis" for the local Newar population, which rapidly engaged in a vigorous publication campaign, resulting in the production of numerous Vamsavall ("family lineage") texts throughout the early- and mid-nineteenth century (Gellner 1999a: 7). Though military aggressors, the Shah court embarked on its own cultural cam- paign. And, though this campaign is usually described as being destructive to local patterns of culture, its early years have been seen as relatively beneficial to the same.</page><page sequence="5">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu I 29 Mary S. Slusser (1982: 78) describes this early Shah campaign in terms of patterns of political patronage. Distrusting the political intentions of Mughal India, Prthivi Narayan Shah, the conquering Shah king, instead patronized local Newar artists, artisans, and dancers: "It is to Prthivi Narayan's interest in native [Newar] culture that we owe much of its survival into modern times" (1982: 78), Slusser baldly states, attributing to his patronage the survival not only of the local plastic and performative arts, but also of local architectural styles as seen in contemporary temples and fountains. This interest in local culture is typically, however, ascribed to Prthivi's son and the second Shah monarch, Pratap Singh Shah, of whom the historian D. R. Regmi writes: "Pratapsinha is credited with the knowledge of Tantric Philosophy and he wrote a book on this subject. He was engaged in constructive activities. He had renounced war to undertake a plan of rehabilitation" (1961: 104). Similarly, Gerard Toffin states: "The short reign of Pratap Singh Shah (1775-8) was an exception to this pattern [of the de facto and dejure fall in the status of the Newar Rajopadhyaya Brahmins].... This king, the oldest son of Prithvi Narayan, was very well disposed towards the Newars..." (1999: 191). It is about this "plan of rehabilita- tion," to use Regmi' s term, that local contemporary scholars are most consistent, and in addition to merely rehabilitating local culture generally, Pratap Singh is credited with Sanskritizing, and thus transforming, many of these cultural elements. It was under his direction, for example, that the local neighborhood of Varhgha became known as "Indra Chowk" and that the Kathmandu festival in which Bhairav most prominently appears - the yem yah punhi - became nominally assimilated to its classical Hindu rite, the Indrajatra. In addition to the Shah patronage of the arts, purohits of the Shah court made the publication of Sanskrit language texts one of their major responsibilities. Following the reigns of the first two pre-Valley Shah kings, Dravya Shah and Purna Shah, who produced no textual material, the Shah kings left an extraordinary amount of literature, beginning with Chatra Shah in 1609: rock-cut inscriptions (sildpatra or sildlekh), manuscripts (abhilekh), and pillar inscriptions (stambhalekh)? One example of a text that was produced in the courts of the early Shah kings, and one that will provide us with a useful textual counterpoint to the twentieth-century TRC volume, is the Indradhvajotsava Pujd, a ritual text collecting and commenting on the portions of classical Sanskrit texts that handle the Indra festival, a festival in which Bhairav prominently and repeatedly appears.8 Sakti Vallabha Bhattacarya Arjyala (hereafter, Arjyala) was the court purohit of Prthivi Narayan Shah and author of this text, one of many produced in the Shah court that elucidates the larger Shah task of its integration into a culturally Newar milieu.9 Devoid of Newar vocabulary, the Indradhvajotsava Pujd, composed of Mitramisra's seventeenth- century Dharmasastric Viramitrodaya and Arjyala' s own commentary, is composed completely in nonhybrid Sanskrit, a sign of its post-Malla composition.10 Mitramisra's text liberally cites the Devi Purdna, while drawing heavily also on the Visnudharmottara Parana, Brhat Samhitd, Kdlikd Purdna, Rdjamarttanda, Brahma Purdna, and Bhavisya Purdna, in order of decreasing number of citations;</page><page sequence="6">30 / Michael C. Baltutis and, due to its diligent citation of classical Sanskrit texts, the Ddnaprakdsa upon which Arjyala comments eschews any reference to local and nonclassical rites. Its classical ritual vocabulary thus allowed the Shah authors to (re-)situate the festival in and to (re-)connect the festival to its classical Indian heritage, disconnecting the festival from its Kathmandu Valley locus and Newar moorings. In its granting of particular importance to the festival of Indra, this text is representative of the larger Gorkhall project: rather than minding the festival's Newar foci - the celebration of death and the remembrance of the ancestors, themes frequently facilitated by atten- tion to Bhairav - it ascribes to the festival the classical Indian meanings of kingship and dominion, values pertinent to the Gorkhalis and their recent successful invasion of the Kathmandu Valley. Thus, just as the previous Newar kings had defined them- selves by their extra- Valley origins - their purohits came from Tirhut in Mithila and their tutelary goddess Taleju (Tulja) from western India - so too did the Shah kings claim for themselves a ritual lineage that stretched back to North India (Gellner 1999a: 9).11 More than simply affirming a lineage, however, the Shah kings' and their purohits' familiarity with the Hindu and Sanskritic texts of the region allowed them to draw upon this corpus in crafting a new - despite traditionally Indie - festival of Indra. The lndradhvajotsava Pujd serves, then, neither as a means to prescribe the festival's performances, nor to describe the role of the festival in a larger cultural milieu. Rather, the construction of this text resembles the imperial process that Inden asserts led to the production of the Visnudharmottara Purdna. Building on his previous definition of "human agency" - "the realized capacity of people to act effectively upon their world... purposively and reflectively, in more or less complex inter-relationships with one another, to reiterate and remake the world in which they live" (2000: 23) - Inden considers the intertextuality of the seventh-century Visnudharmottara Purdna as the apex of a sectarian "scale of texts" constructed in the Pancaratrin-oriented empire of the Kashmiri king Karkota Naga. These authors conscientiously reworked textual materials from orthodox Vedic schools with the goal of giving hermeneutical primacy to this new Purana, one that eschewed any notion of locality, vis-^-vis the old lineage-based Vedic texts (Inden 2000: 55). Similarly, the Shah production of the lndradhvajotsava Pujd also served not simply as a means of relating to the dynasty's new neighbors, but more significantly as a hermeneutical exercise whose primary goal was the wresting of control of local culture from its producers, reinterpreting relevant ritual elements that could then be wielded for the purpose of, primarily, the construction of a new and unified Nepalese nation. Key to this project was the wresting of agency from Bhairav himself and the granting of agency to the overtly Hindu deity Indra. Thus the cultural conflict between Newar and Nepali Hindu plays itself out not simply through political or economic means and not simply through religious rheto- ric, but through a replacement of one royal deity by another - the Newar Bhairav for the Hindu Indra - a replacement whose extant metonymic relations to the Newar Jyapus signal and reinforce the shift in dynastic power. Thus, the Shah agents - most</page><page sequence="7">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency \ and Local Power in Kathmandu I 31 notably the king Pratap Singh Shah and his scribe Arjyala - closely associated themselves with a deity who could supplant the local Bhairav, while still maintaining a connection to the local and emplaced power that Bhairav possesses. That the king and royal scribe were agents who were able, to use Inden's phrase, "to reiterate and remake the world in which they live" is clear; their Sanskritization of Newar culture, however, and the simultaneity of Bhairav and Indra in the contemporary festival reveal the contiguity that obtained between the Shah king and the Hindu Indra, whose name and festival provided them with the authority to subvert the name and festival of Bhairav. This facet of the Shah reformation, the replacement of Bhairav with Indra, was not complete, however. Not only did Bhairav survive as a prominent member of the pantheon of the Kathmandu Valley, each of whose major cities possesses a large and prominent temple to this fierce deity, we shall see in both the renovation of his temple and in the subsequent TRC volume a bold Newar response to the de facto Hindu state of Nepal. The Newar Response In an unpublished article on "smearing" and "binding" - the South Asian "vernacu- lar Tantric ritual technologies" frequently used in the worship of Bhairav - David Gordon White asserts that the textual and ethnographic data on this deity leads to the conclusion that Bhairav emerged in North India as an important Tantric deity closely associated with goddess cults as well as with the Kapalikas, and as the object of a significant devotional cult closely identified with that of Siva, in about the same seventh- to tenth-century period.... Nearly everywhere else in North India and Nepal, the cult of Bhairava- or more often of the Bhairavas - owes little to these elite Sanskritic traditions (n.d.: 7). Indeed, there is little that is "elite" about Bhairav in the Kathmandu Valley. Though his temples here are huge and located in prominent squares and at major inter- sections, the representations of Bhairav in local dances - sometimes multiple mani- festations in the same troupe - nearly always depict his role as the protector of the goddess. During the Indrajatra, it is primarily Bhairav' s head that is diversely displayed in such iconic forms as large fierce anthropomorphic temple images, clay pots that dispense beer, and six-foot tall poles topped by his head (see Figures 1-3). One of the ways that Newars responded to the Nepali Hindu replacement of Bhairav with Indra in the latter 's festival was through a refocusing on images of Newar royalty, of which several examples can be cited.12 With the end of the reign of his Malla dynasty in sight, Jaya Prakas Malla, the final Malla king of Kathmandu, constructed a permanent house for Kumarl, the juvenile and virginal manifestation of the Malla tutelary goddess Taleju, near the old palace, a residence still opera- tive today. He also included in the Indra festival a series of processions of Kumari,</page><page sequence="8">32 / Michael C.

Baltutis Figure 3</page><page sequence="11">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu I 35 accompanied by her brothers, Bhairav and Ganesa, to all parts of the city. Despite the general Hindu notion that the king is an incarnation of Visnu or that he bears an association with Indra, for the Newars it was always Bhairav who incarnated as the king and who was seen as a royal divinity. Although this idea remained potent generally, at least some groups of Newars further distanced themselves from Hindu orthodoxy by equating Bhairav with - and by tracing their own ancestry ultimately to - the semi-historical and non-Hindu KiratI king Yalambar Yalunga (Toffin 1999: 161-62).13 A Narrative Response: King Yalambar Yalambar' s story begins in the bilingual (Sanskrit and Newar) Gopdlardjavamsdvali, which lists Elam (Yalambar), who reigned for ninety years, as the first of thirty- six Kirat kings (kirdt rajah).14 The Kirat dynasty had defeated the Gopala and Mahisapala dynasties and was in turn defeated by the Licchavi, the first dynasty for which there are historical records in Nepal and which claimed descent from the Suryavamsa lineage. Of the fate of the Kirat, the Gopdlardjavamsdvali states, 'These Kirat now occupy the land between the rivers Tamakosi and Arunakosi," a region currently inhabited primarily by the Ral and Limbu, Tibeto-Burman peoples linguistically related to the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley (Vajracarya and Malla 1985: 122). Though there is little if any concrete textual data on the person of Yalambar outside the Gopdlardjavamsdvali, Yalambar hardly exists in a vacuum. Hiltebeitel, in his second volume on the Draupadi cult of South India, writes of the images of the head of the bhuta Aravan found at numerous Draupadi temples. These images, "placed on corners and edges of the temple roof or the top of the compound wall" allow Aravan to guard the temple "from those of his own kind" (Hiltebeitel 1991: 298). Aravan' s mythology is intimately tied to that of the Tamil Mahdbhdrata, and despite the presence of multiforms of Aravan throughout South Asia, Hiltebeitel hypothesizes that these extra-Tamil multiforms do not constitute a part of any hero cult tradition that commemorates either the Mahdbhdrata or any other folk epic. Rather, Aravan is part of a "free-floating Mahdbhdrata folklore" (Hiltebeitel 1991: 302).15 Mines (2005: 131) asserts a similar peripheral role for the fierce gods she encountered in Tamilnadu, where, similar to Aravan, they have neither their own public processions nor regular domestic worship; rather, as in Kathmandu, they serve as protectors of village goddesses. Despite these assertions of the peripheral status of these semi-divine figures and of the lack of connection between the figure of Aravan and a larger performative tradition, Yalambar' s narrative, particular to the city of Kathmandu, is substantially developed and well integrated into what could be considered a local "hero cult." The narrative of Yalambar-Bhairav is a multifaceted one, and though it bears only a nominal association with the brief account provided in the Gopdlardjavamsdvali, parts of it are well known throughout the city's common oral tradition. The follow- ing account is a compilation of two articles from the TRC volume, articles authored</page><page sequence="12">36 / Michael C. Baltutis by Kumar Prasad Darsan ("A Report on Sri Akas Bhairavanath and Indrajatra" [2003]) and Sarad Kumar Dangol ("A Short Essay on Sri Akas Bhairav" [2003]): The Kauravas and Pandavas announced the commencement of the Mahabharata War, with the kings and armies of various countries each having been invited to do battle, each on one side or the other. Having heard the news, the glorious Kirat king Yalambar arrived at Kuruksetra with his sixteen armies and formed them into one camp in order merely to see the battle. Krsna, having heard of Yalambar' s arrival, went personally to Yalambar' s camp and asked Yalambar, the Lord of the Kirats, who was also a partial avatar of Siva (bhagavdn siva amsdvatdr): "On which side will you fight?" Yalambar replied: "I have only come to view the battle," though of course he had his weapons with him, and thus he continued, "In the end, I will fight on whichever side loses this war." Hearing this, Krsna went some distance from Yalambar to consider his plan. Krsna thought: "If this man fights on the losing side, and in the course of battle the Pandavas and Kauravas annihilate each other, then he alone will remain victorious. Thus, this man must be removed from Kuruksetra." Krsna then swiftly removed Yalambar' s head from his shoulders, placing his head high up in a large tree so that the head would be able to look down upon the War, according to his previous request. Krsna was still afraid of the power of Yalambar' s gaze (drsti sakti), however, and he struck the severed head with an arrow, causing it to fly through the Akas Marg [the Milky Way] and then to fall into the river.16 From here, Yalambar' s narrative exits its epic framework completely, the locale shifting to a strictly local one - the city of Kathmandu generally and the neighbor- hood Indra Chowk specifically - and the story culminates in the performance of the Indra festival. Nirmal Bajracarya, in his TRC article, narrates Yalambar' s post- War story and Bhairav's intimate connection to his temple's Jyapu priests: Yalambar' s head flowed along until it reached the hvamgah (Sanskrit, sangam, the confluence of three rivers) of the Bagmatl, VisnumatI, and Iksumati rivers.17 Since Yalambar arrived via the Akas Marg, his severed head began to be referred to as Akas Bhairav.18 King Yalambar Yaluriga came to a Jyapu (farmer) in a dream and said to him: "Out of love for the place of my birth (janmabhumi ko mdyd le), I have left but now I have returned; from now on I will be responsible for protection (raksdrtha), so erect my head in whichever place where I can offer such protection." In order to affirm what he saw in his dream, the Jyapu went to see the triveni (hvamga) and he indeed saw the head. He took this head to the place of the river, built a small hut (jhupro), and established it there. From that day until now, every year during the Indrajatra, a similar type of hut (chhdpro) is erected for eight days (2003: 20). 19 There are three main events in this story, all of which contribute to the present thesis,</page><page sequence="13">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu I 37 that the person of Akas Bhairav and his Jyapu priests together constitute a complex agent and that the TRC volume is a public manifestation of this complex agency, via the establishment of an alternative lineage.20 The first stage of this process is in the conflict between the Kirat king Yalambar and the Hindu deity Krsna. The conflict between Hindu deities is hardly a unique trope - for example, Krsna himself comes into greater prominence in the Mahdbhdrata through rivalries with and victories over rival kings and deities - but the rivalry between divinities of such different valences, as in Yalambar's case, warrants further notice. Mines, in her study of similar fierce deities in South India, notices a similar pattern of rivalry: Fierce gods are created in the village itself as gods or goddesses born from men or women who have met violent deaths. All over Tamilnadu, fierce gods are born this way, in violence and injustice.... Sometimes these violent origins may be linked to Brahmanical puranas (sic) in which fierce gods are the offspring of anger, intrigue, and violence or injustice among those gods thought to be more benign... (2005: 133). Thus, Yalambar's death at the hands of a "more benign" deity constitutes the initial step in establishing a strict dichotomy between an established hegemonic orthodoxy (represented by Krsna) and a new adaptation to the same (argued via the presence of the tribal-Tantric Yalambar-Bhairav). The second step, once his story leaves the confines of the Mahdbhdrata, is Yalambar's return to the place of his birth. Having offered himself in sacrifice he sheds his tribal Kirat origins and is reborn as Bhairav, thus becoming a deity powerful enough to fulfill his necessary duty: the protection of the area.21 The third and final step constitutes the conclusion of Yalambar's narrative but the beginning of his ritual life in the city; the lineage of Kathmandu's Newar population, now traced back to Yalambar himself, is then localized in the city of Kathmandu, and the establishment of this lineage is subsequently asserted to be coterminous with the very foundation of the city. A Performative Response: Kathmandu and the Indrajdtrd Each Newar city of the Valley is divided into two halves: an upper half (thone) and a lower half (kvane), locations determined by the flow of the nearest river (compare Toffin 1996). In Kathmandu, to a greater degree than in other Valley cities, this bifurcation results also in an interest in the location of the city's center (dathu), an otherwise vague designation that outside of the performance of the Indra festival is neither fixed nor debated.22 In Kathmandu, the term dathu can refer to several different geographical areas, however; among them is the sizable region of the old city containing the central festival area of Maru Tol23 and the line between the two lion door-guardians outside the Taleju temple inside the royal palace (Toffin 1996: 69). But during the Indra festival, the dathu is liberally scattered throughout the city, with various neighborhoods given this attribution, as each becomes ritually important, and it is Indra Chowk that is most frequently given this label, as many of</page><page sequence="14">38 / Michael C. Baltutis the festival's rites occur here. The attributed centrality of Indra Chowk during the festival resonates throughout the city outside of the festival's chronological bounds, however. The authors of the TRC volume describe the significance of this neighbor- hood, thus providing for its status as dathu, in two different ways, both of which foreground the intimate relationship between Bhairav and Indra Chowk. First, the event of Yalambar's transformation into Bhairav provides the setting for the very foundation of the city of Kathmandu by King Gunakamadeva in the tenth century. Darsan continues the narrative: It is also said that Sri MahalaksmI visited King Gunakamadeva in a dream, in which she ordered the king, who had come to this place to do pujd, to plan out the city (nagar basduna).... As he was told, the king did pujd and established a first seat there (dsan nirmdn gart); he also established (sthdpand) the murti of a second deity, the glorious Bhagavan Kantlsvar Mahadev. Amidst them, he also set up (pratisthdpand) a golden image of King Indra (2003: 25). The seat that Gunakamadeva establishes is that on which Yalambar-Bhairav himself sits - that which is now inside the temple - and the other two deities that the king establishes must be seen as being of a piece with Bhairav. To take the second one first, he sets up Indra in proximity to Bhairav; this image of Indra is annually set up atop a twenty-foot tall platform opposite the temple during the eight days of the Indrajatra and is, during the remainder of the year, stored in a closet upstairs in Bhairav 's temple. The first deity named in this passage, Kantlsvar Mahadev, is a street-set stone deity (Newari, lohdn dyo) after whom the city of Kathmandu is named: Kantipur. Thus, the goddess MahalaksmI has Gunakamadeva simultaneously establish four things: the city of Kathmandu, a seat for AkaS Bhairav, the stone deity Kantlsvar, and the festival image of Indra. The coalescence of these objects, places, and deities in this account is hardly coincidental, but rather signals the centrality - in terms both of their significance and geography - of all four of these objects to the urban identity of Kathmandu. Also not coincidental is the chronological contiguity of all of the aforementioned constructions: during the annual festival of Indra, Akas Bhairav is worshipped as the incarnation of Yalambar, when his severed head is raised and worshipped at Indra Chowk in front of Kantlsvar' s stone image. Darsan handles the copresence of Indra and Bhairav, read in terms of the historical stratigraphy of the festival above, in his version of the Yalambar narrative: Indra and the other deities had come to this place [Indra Chowk] to do pujd in front of Akas Bhairav, to receive his beneficence, and to request a boon (varaddn): "May I sit near you during all these festivals?" It is because of this [request] that during the Indrajatra, Indra' s platform (khat) is made and established here (2003: 25).24 This meeting between Indra and Yalambar-Bhairav not only accounts for one of the</page><page sequence="15">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu I 39 many proximate appearances of these two deities during the Indrajatra, but it also reverses two parallel effects of Sanskritization. First, we see a "demonic adversary" converting a deity into his devotee, the opposite of the more orthodox process that Hiltebeitel describes. Second, more than simply reversing the prior elision of Bhairav from Arjyala's Sanskrit commentary on the Indrajatra, Darsan's TRC article does Arjyala one better: rather than eliminating Indra altogether, Darsan retains Indra and brings him into Yalambar' s account, making him submit himself and become a witness to Bhairav' s glory. In addition to associating the place of Indra Chowk with the historical foundations of the city of Kathmandu, the authors of the TRC volume assert the geographical centrality of Indra Chowk in another way. Rather than using historical, textual, or narrative means, several of these authors utilize a quasilinguistic, or even mantric, means for pursuing this argument. At the center of this largely associative argument is the single letter, better yet the "syllable" or even "phoneme" - an aksara in Devanagari script - best transliterated as yem.25 This phoneme, multivalent due to its near-absence of linguistic referent, allows connections to all of the above-mentioned festivals, deities, objects, and places. First, and employing the suffix punhi (Sanskrit, purnimd, the full-moon day), the phoneme yem is used to refer to the Newar festival of Indra. One local scholar explained the term yem yah punhi as "the [full-moon day's] jdtrd of the month of Yarhla," referring to the Newar month that loosely corresponds to the Hindu month of Bhadrapad in which the festival is celebrated.26 Though the orthography of yarhld renders this explanation difficult - in more traditional Newar spellings, yarhld improbably begins with the velar nasal (n) rather than with the first of the four Devanagari semi-vowels - his situating of the Indra festival as the final day of Yarhla reflects the importance of the full-moon day for rites to the ancestors and to Bhairav. Other glosses, however, treat yemydh (sometimes also inyd, more fully, yerhyd dyah) as a single word that names the deity Indra; the suffix punhi, then, metonymically refers to the festival by referring to the name of its most important day.27 Darsan extends the connection between the phoneme and the Indra festival: "The tradition referred to above is also written as yem yah, the meaning of which is as follows: yem refers to Yalambar Raja (Akas Bhairavanath), and yah refers to ydtrd or jdtrd, also known as [Nepali] parv [festival]" (2003: 25). His explanation, whether by design or by accident, introduces yet another use of yem and extends its scope from the festival of Indra to the person of Yalambar. Not simply to establish a symbolic connection, however, N. Bajracarya asserts that the identity of Bhairav and Yalambar is ritualized during the Indrajatra, following the establishment of Yalambar-Bhairav's mask late on the festival's first night: "After Bhairav is placed in the small hut (chhdpro) constructed [in front of the temple], the letter (aksara) ya is written on his chest, according to tradition. By this letter ya9 the person of Yalambar Yalunga is brought to mind" (2003: 21-22). The extension of the use of the phoneme not only brings together the festival and the divine hero, but it also reasserts the subservience of Indra, a concept earlier introduced by Darsan; whereas</page><page sequence="16">40 / Michael C. Baltutis the latter asserted this subservience narratively with the account of Indra' s groveling before and his requesting of a boon from Yalambar, Darsan here accomplishes this Newarization of the classical Hindu festival "linguistically" by the reassigning of this phoneme, changing its referent from Indra to Yalambar-Bhairav.28 The phoneme yem has acquired yet additional referents, however. N. Bajracarya, in his article on the geographical shifting of the sahgam of the BagmatI, VisnumatI, and Ik su mat I rivers northward from Teku to Indra Chowk, provides another use for this flexible phoneme: "In the Kirat time, Indra Chowk was called Yambi. And sometimes Yambi was also called Yaprnga or Yam, it is said. It is possible to translate these Apabhramsa words - Yambi, Yaprnga, or Yam - into the word for Kathmandu (Kantipur): Yem" (2003: 19). Bajracarya' s assertion of the geo- graphic scope of yem is thus two-pronged: first, Indra Chowk shares in the multiple uses of this phoneme, as the neighborhood itself bears the name Yam; second, and to further extend the metonymic references of yem (for example, the full-moon day refers to the entire Indrajatra festival), the location of Indra Chowk also encompasses the entire city of Kathmandu.29 Darsan reinforces this tradition: "The residents of Kathmandu also refer to Indrajatra as yam vanegu or jdtrd svayegu [Newari, 'going to Kathmandu (yam)' or 'seeing a festival']" (2003: 25).30 More than simply refer- ring to the geographical or ritual center (dathu) of the city, the creative linguistics used by these authors signal the urban matrix that a festival (the Indrajatra), a deity (Akas Bhairav), a place (Indra Chowk), an ancient hero (Yalambar), and a city (Kathmandu) all comprise.31 A Genealogical Response: Akas Bhairav as Aju Concluding his version of Yalambar' s narrative, N. Bajracarya introduces a new wrinkle in the "unity (ekai) of Akas Bhairav and Yalambar Yaluriga," stating, "We also refer to Bhairav as Aju" (2003: 20). Aju (or Ajudyah) is the Newar term for "grandfather" (or "the grandfather deity"), a protective deity performatively and narratively juxtaposed to the plural grandmothers, the Ajima. Aju's performative connection to goddesses generally can be seen in the urban processions of Kumari, most notably those that take place during Indrajatra and that stop at Indra Chowk where her priests exchange pujd plates (phul prasdd) with those of Bhairav- Yalambar-Aju (Maharjan 2003: 41).32 Their narrative connection can be seen in yet another facet of the story of Gunakamadeva's establishment of the city of Kathmandu. Within the boundaries of the city he established - whose form was that of the sword of the Goddess (usually of Taleju) and the nodes of whose border were the shrines of the Ajima - he demarcated a second and smaller area. Gunakamadeva constructed this "inner city" in the form of the point of Bhairav 's downward- pointing and triangular sword, locating the shrine of Bhairav-Ajudyah at its southern apex, with Lucumaru Ajima and Asanmaru Ajima at its eastern corner, and Nyatamaru Ajima and Kulaymaru Ajima at its western corner. This Newar emphasis on Aju and the Ajima did not, however, take any place in the Shah Sanskritization process of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</page><page sequence="17">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu I 41 The many urban Ajima received, instead, a standard enumeration of eight and became identified as the Sanskrit Matrka (mother) goddesses. Arjyala, for example, by strictly relying on his inherited Sanskritic tradition, never mentions the Ajima in his Indradhvajotsava Pujd, despite their performative and narrative presence in the local festival. His commentary on Brhat Samhitd 43 and Kdlikd Purdna 87 attempts to clarify the obscure references to the multiple wooden sakra-kumarl poles that surround Indra's single tall pole by providing strictly "Hindu" synonyms: "Thus, these five sakra-kumdrl that are discussed in the Kdlikd Purdna - Nanda, Upananda, and so on - these are the Astamatrkas" (7a). Arjyala' s explanation can be questioned on at least two different levels. First, he has clearly reenumerated this set of feminine objects: the five Kumar! become the eight Matrka. Second, however, he avoids any mention of the Newar Ajima, simultaneously avoiding any reference to Aju and even to the nominally Hindu Bhairav. One of the few authors whose contribution to the TRC volume is in Newar lan- guage, Jyapu Panch, goes beyond the multilingual descriptions of the many names of Bhairav to prescribe a reversal in terminology. Though a reconstruction of modern Nepalese history is not his goal, he urges in his article a return to the pre-Shah vocabulary used to refer to this deity. Neither the name "Bhairav" - nor any of its variants (Bhailah, Bhairah, Bhayrah, Bhyalu, Bhulu, or Bhalu) - is in fact synony- mous with Aju, Panch argues, despite the fact that most people casually interchange them; since the specific confusion in question is that between "Varhgha Aju" and "Akas Bhairav," Panch suggests the following: "If we want to continue calling the deity by his ancient original Newar language name, we must call and worship him by the name Aju, as the word aju in Newar language refers to the head of the family or of the dynasty" (2003: 10). This appellation, then, serves as a more appropriate term not only due to its Newar derivation, but also due to the referent of the term: Vamgha Aju is both the Kirat king Yalambar Yalunga, traceable to the Gopdlardja- vamsdvall, and the ancestral head of the Jyapu jdti, in accordance with an assertion repeated to me by several Jyapu Newars in Kathmandu, that he is "our king." Thus, rather than tacitly agreeing to be legally grouped together with non-Newar Hindus, the Jyapus of Vamgha Tol have reestablished their own ancestral lineage by claiming descent from a local deity, who bears a local name and is situated in a local neighborhood; significantly, all of these local elements can be referred to by the same word: yerh. A Geopolitical Response: Aju and the Nation One more example of the complex agency of Bhairav and the Newar Jyapu jdti should be cited to conclude this article, an example that functions to bring both deity and people fully into "modern Nepal." In the concluding verse of the Bhairav-stuti that opens the TRC volume, Akas Bhairav is lauded as the king of Indra Chowk, his traditional and local sphere of influence. But the contributing authors of the text work to extend his domain well beyond this single neighborhood. Blending the traditional vocabulary of protection with a modern vocabulary of the nation, these</page><page sequence="18">42 / Michael C. Baltutis authors metonymically extend the deity's primary function of protection well beyond the neighborhood, thus again extending the boundaries of Indra Chowk. More than the neighborhood iyem) simply linguistically encompassing the city, however, Mangalprasad Srestha (2003: 17) asserts that Bhairav- Ajudyah is not only the pro- tector of the neighborhood (Newari, raksaydnd cvangu tvdh), but also the protector of the nation (Newari, raksaydnd cvangu dey). And Baldev Juju prescribes the ideal religious response to this protector of the nation: "Thus, Ajudyah as the protector of the country (Nepali, des) is a deity of great power. We should pray that his benefi- cent image will always circulate among the Nepali people (nepdllharu)" (2003: 15). In addition to extending the deity's beneficence to the nation, Juju also enlarges the scope of devotional respondent: more than the residents of Indra Chowk, or the Jyapu jdti, or even all Newars, Juju advocates for an ongoing relationship between Ajudyah and all Nepali people, regardless of ethnicity or religious affiliation - thus all residents of the modern nation-state of Nepal. The construction of the TRC volume, then, represents much more than a simple recognition or "remembrance" (smdrikd) of the event of the renovation of a particu- lar temple, as the volume bills itself. Rather, deftly weaving together narrative, performative, and linguistic elements, the volume serves as a concerted effort to assert a Newar Jyapu presence in the city via the establishment and publication of a coagency with Bhairav-Yalambar-Ajudyah, whose fierceness allows the authors of the volume, to cite Mines again, "to potentially restructure the system of conven- tional rankings" that had been established in late eighteenth-century Nepal.</page><page sequence="19">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu I 43 Appendix Nepali Language Bhairav-stuti from Sri Akds Bhairavandth Mandir Jirnoddhdr (2003) Refrain: Victory, victory to Bhairavanath, the Lord of all ills; be gracious, O Lord. jay jay bhairavandth duhkhlharu led I prabhu sdth day a rahos he ndth II You come before Ganesa and Kumar [Kumari], with your group of ghouls.

Baltutis Notes 1. The first documented renovation was in 1668 (Sthapit 2003: 45). 2. Bernier sympathetically critiques the visual impact of the once-ubiquitous ceramic tiles: "They are always incongruous within the overall pagoda scheme of brick and wood and they transform the fasades to which they are attached into something totally new in Nepalese architecture" (1979: 79). 3. Gellner refers to the Newars as a "quasi-ethnic group" (1999b). 4. My use of the term "practical" resonates with Grieve's (2006: 17-18) use of "prosaic" and "cadastral," terms that focus on the performative uses of urban geog- raphy and on the local production of religious orthodoxy, and with Bourdieu's "practical logic" and its ability "to organize all thoughts, perceptions and actions by means of a few generative principles" (1990: 86), both scholars' terms serving to counter the ideological, universal, and orthodox. 5. Erndl's (1989: 239) article in this volume - on Bhairo and Vaisno Devi in Jammu - is especially pertinent here. After Vaisno Devi beheads Bhairo who was chasing after her, he is granted boons of liberation and popular worship. Devotees typically visit his rock-cut shrine before hers in contemporary practice. 6. Siddhi Vinayak's message reads: "Sri Akas Bhairavanath Mandir Jlrnoddhar karya prenanadayl svarupama sampanna bhaekoma samasta sahakaml tatha bhakta- janaharuma hamro hardik badhal." (We offer our sincerest blessings to the group of workers and devotees for the inspiring appearance and the prosperity achieved in the renovation of the Sri Akas Bhairavanath temple.) And Kinetic' s message reads: "Sri Akas Bhairavanath Mandir Jlrnoddhar karyako purnatako sukhada avasarma sabai sahayoglharulal hardik badhal." (Our heartfelt thanks to all who helped out in the very happy event of the renovation of the Sri Akas Bhairav temple.) 7. Pant, in his Gorkhdko ltihds (1985: 494-500), provides a lengthy list of the many Sanskrit texts and commentaries copied and composed under the reigns of the Shah kings, including the Visnusahasrandmastotra (CE 1610), Kalidasa's Meghaduta (CE 1621), the Kdsikhanda (CE 1635), and the Hitopadesa (CE 1655). 8. In the present author's possession are two copies of this text. The first (Al 150/ 10) is numbered as the ninth (navama) and is undated; while the other (Al 150/09), numbered as the seventeenth (saptadasa), provides its date of writing (rather than of its composition) as Vikram Samvat 1931 (CE 1874), and its scribe as the Brahmin Indravilasa Sarman. 9. Arjyala composed his most famous work, the Jayaratndkaranataka, in Vikram Samvat 1849 (CE 1792) (Pant 1985: 65). 10. Kane (1962: 943-45) states that Mitramisra lived and wrote in the first half of the seventeenth century and provides (942-45) a brief summary of the contents of the Viramitrodaya, a text composed of twenty-two parts, the title of each ending with the word prakdsa. Though Arjyala' s text clearly states that it is a commentary on the Ddnaprakdsa, it is the Rdjanltiprakdsa portion that contains a section on the</page><page sequence="21">Fierce Gods, Divine Agency, and Local Power in Kathmandu I 45 Indra festival. Regarding the unpublished Danaprakdsa section, Kane simply states: "It is an extensive work and contains the usual topics about gifts" (945). 1 1 . Remarkably, among the scores of Newar castes and subcastes, only the Jyapus, about whom more will be said later, are without an extra- Valley myth of origin, a narrative lacuna that has led some to consider them indigenous to the Valley (Gellner and Pradhan 1999: 160-161). 12. Chalier-Visuvalingam (1989) provides as another, and narrative, connection between Bhairav and Indra that both were accused of the murder of a Brahmin (of Brahma and Vrtra, respectively), and both were required to perform penance in Varanasl. 13. Fisher (2002: 127) notes a similar adaptation that the residents of the Nepalese western hill region of Myagdi made vis-a-vis the centralized Nepalese state. Producing new genealogical accounts that invert forms of previous "Sanskritized" accounts, these groups trace their origins instead to a long-forgotten Buddhist, indigenous, or autochthonous past, explicitly citing their differences from those of Hindu populations of Nepal. 14. The Gopalardjavamsavali contains several dated entries, the earliest of which is Nepal Samvat 177 (CE 1057) and the latest Nepal Samvat 509 (CE 1389) (Vajracarya and Malla 1985: i). 15. His story is also known throughout the greater Himalayan region, similarly in those places where the Mahdbhdrata is performed (Sax 2002). In Garhwal, he is called Babrik or Jakh. 16. Other versions of Yalambar' s arrival in Kathmandu are related in the TRC volume. In one version, Yalambar is having difficulties seeing the war from his position in the tree, and in his continued attempts his head fell from the branches of the tree and dropped into the river. 17. N. Bajracarya (2003: 22) argues that the sahgam of these rivers had shifted south from Indra Chowk to Teku, the current location of the sahgam, nearly one mile from Indra Chowk. Much of his evidence is linguistic, tracing the Newar term for Indra Chowk - vamgha - to "hvarhga" thus establishing that the place was named after its most prominent natural feature. This linguistic-cum-geographical identity will become important in discussing the metonymous relationship between this neighborhood and the city of Kathmandu. 18. In some versions of the story, Yalambar also takes the form of Drona's "disciple," Ekalavya. 19. N. Bajracarya summarizes this transformation even more directly: "According to a Tantric viewpoint in which the gods and goddesses are played by humans [where the deities possess humans], the elders say that the famous (pratdpi) KiratI Raja Yalambar Yalunga through his power was transformed (parinat) into the powerful and revered deity, Sri Akas Bhairav of Vamgha Tol" (2003: 19). Though only the rare procession represents the Garhwali ritual surrounding Babrik, the Tamil situation resembles that in Kathmandu: "Aravan's ability to see the entire war reflects the practice in the DraupadI cult of setting up a clay image of his head on a</page><page sequence="22">46 / Michael C. Baltutis post to watch the ritual proceedings that represent the war, from its beginning to its end" (Hiltebeitel 1988: 325). 20. I am using the word "priest" here and elsewhere to translate the Newar dyopdla, "god-protector". 21. This notion of sacrifice is emphasized not as much in Yalambar's story as it is in a parallel version of a definitively "epic" performance, that of Yalambar's Himalayan counterpart, Babrlk (Sax 2002: 99-100). 22. Holle, Toffin, and Rimal assert the same: "It seems that nowadays, for most people, the middle part of the town is not very significant. In fact, only the Maharjan of Mara state that they belong to Dathu" (1993: 45). 23. This area that focuses on Maru Tol contains roughly one-third of all of the city's residential bahdh (monasteries) (Gutschow and Kolver 1975: 1 15). 24. Darsan further connects the rites of Indra's festival to the construction of the city: "Following the commencement of the ydtrd of Ganesa, Bhairav, and Kumarl for the creation of the capital city (rdjdhdnl nirmdna garna)...King Indra established the Indradhvaja on the right side of the palace..." (2003: 26). 25. Rather than simply a "mantra" this phoneme is more similar to a bija mantra, a seed mantra that consists of a consonant and an ensuing vowel and, in some cases, a concluding nasal. Whereas seed mantras are ritually utilized as mantras, the phoneme yem, as will be seen below, is used in a wider variety of ways, few of which could be termed "ritual," according to most definitions of the term. 26. Triratna Manandhar, personal communication. A local Buddhist scholar and organizer, Rajendra Man Bajracarya, told me that whereas Hindus celebrate Indra- jatra, Buddhists celebrate yem yah punhi, though it was unclear if he was referring to the names used or the rites performed. 27. Gellner, personal communication. Lowdin (1998: 106) names Sunakothi's performance inyapunhi, though gives no diacritics. 28. Indra's "residence" on Bhairav- Yalambar's chest is, in this case, the inverse of the Hindu image of Rama placed on/in the heart of Hanuman. In the latter case, Rama's residence on Hanuman' s heart signals Hanuman' s devotion and subservi- ence to that which is the essence of all things. Indra's residence on the chest of Yalambar, on the other hand, indicates the significance and centrality of the one on whose heart he dwells. 29. Panch (2003: 10), in his TRC article, provides some of the documented variations on name Varhgha: Sri Vamkat Sthan,Vamkal, &amp;ri Vamkodo-mandapa- storak, Varhkaro, &amp;rl Vamkadu-mandapsthan, Vamkado, Omgal, Nhomgal, and Ogal Tol. 30. In most accounts dealing with this phoneme, little if any distinction is made between yem and yam. Patan, the city directly to the south of Kathmandu, was tradi- tionally referred to as Yala (cf. G. Bajracarya 1974). 31. Panch states in his article: "And it is also believed that this country (Newari, dey) is previously called yem after the name of King Yalambar" (2003: 1 1). 32.
