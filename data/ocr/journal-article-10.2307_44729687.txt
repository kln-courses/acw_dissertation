Soltis Federal Aviation Administration U.S. Department of Transportation John W. Olcott Business and Commercial Aviation ABSTRACT Aircraft seats have traditionally been designed to comply with static strength requirements. Dynamic perform- ance standards that address both seat strength and the occupant impact protec- tion characteristics of the seat have recently been defined for general avia- tion aircraft. These new dynamic per- formance standards have been forwarded to the Federal Aviation Administration with a recommendation that they become incorporated into Part 23 of the Fed- eral Aviation Regulations. The devel- opment of those standards, which was based on a comprehensive analysis of full-scale aircraft impact tests, gen- eral aviation aircraft accident data analysis and a dynamic test program of general aviation seats, is reviewed. THE DESIGN OF PAST-GENERATION AIRCRAFT emphasized the airworthiness of the vehicle. Except for a few unique air- craft, the design characteristics of crash dynamics and occupant protection received secondary attention. Accident investigations focused more on probable cause and its relation to airworthiness rather than the crashwor thiness of designs. While emphasis on airworthi- ness is appropriate, this lack of atten- tion on crashwor thiness was due in part to the lack of understanding and definition of the response of an air- craft subjected to a crash event and the unavailability of definitive or consistent crash dynamics design stan- dards. The state-of-the-art of past-gen- eration aircraft, which is reflected in the Federal Aviation Regulations, did not address the real time relation- ship between the crash event and the occupant protection character i sties of the aircraft; they merely required static-strength level of occupant reten- tion and post-impact considerations such as emergency evacuation and flam- mabi 1 i ty . The subject of crashwor th iness was, however, receiving increased in- terest among researchers who concluded subsequent to detailed studies of ac- cident investigation reports that the crash survivability of aircraft could be greatly improved if crashwor thiness was considered initially in the air- crafts design stage. Early in 1960, the U.S. Army began to fund a series of long range and continual research studies directed toward understanding the crash dynamic characteristics of their current aircraft fleet and improv- ing the occupant impact protection features of those and future aircraft. Their early studies defined the state- of- the art in crashwor thiness , and their findings and respective design standards are consolidated in the U.S. Army's Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide (1)*. Upon witnessing these events and the successful implementation of newly developed crash dynamic technology into the new generation of U.Sl Army rotorcraft, namely the Sikorsky UH-60A Black Hawk and the Hughes AH-64 Apache helicopters, the likelihood of improv- ing the crash survivability of civil aircraft became evident. In the 1970s the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) conducted considerable research concerning the crash dynamic character- *Number in parentheses designate refer- ences at the end of paper. 4.413 0096-736X/86/9404-041 3$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">istics of small general aviation air- craft. NASA conducted a test series of 21 controlled full-scale impact tests on single-engine and twin-engine general aviation airplanes (2). Re- sults from those tests provided a sub- stantial qualitative and quantitative data base regarding the crash behavior and occupant characteristics of small general aviation aircraft. In the 1970s the FAA had also become very active in a wide range of research and development programs that addressed crashworthiness . The FAA embarked on three parallel crash dynamics pro- grams (3) that addressed transport category aircraft (4) , general aviation aircraft and rotorcraft. These pro- grams were a concerted effort to relate the crash event itself to the subse- quent aircraft/occupant response and respective injury criteria through an interrelated study of accident data, crash dynamics analytical methods, full-scale aircraft impact tests and aircraft seat dynamic tests. These studies formed a comprehensive data base that provided a bases for defin- ition of crash dynamic design standards applicable for civil aircraft. In the summer of 1982 at the re- quest of FAA Administrator, J. Lynn Helms, a voluntary panel representing a broad constituency from the general aviation community was formed for the purpose of recommending regulatory and nonr egulatory means by which the FAA could increase general aviation safety. That panel, known as the Gen- eral Aviation Safety Panel (GASP)*, had after considerable deliberation and homework submitted their final report to the FAA in early 1983. In its report the GASP made several spe- cific recommendations regarding general aviation safety, some of which per- tained to crashworthiness and crash tolerance of general aviation air- craft. The FAA responded to those recommendations by urging the GASP to gather knowledgeable members from the research community, from the manu- facturers of general aviation products and from general aviation user groups for the purpose of further developing those recommendations concerning crash tolerance . As requested, the GASP formed a technical working group to prepare a detailed proposal concerning recom- mended additions to FAR Part 23 (5) in the area of crashworthiness. The *John W. Olcott , editor and associate publisher of Business and Commercial Aviation, served as chairman of the General Aviation Safety Panel. technical working group did consider- able research, including simulations of typical general aviation crash events. As a consequence of the GASP working sessions, the General Aviation Safety Panel submitted to the FAA on May 2, 1984 its proposal for enhanced crash tolerance for small, FAR Part 23 general aviation aircraft applying for initial type certification after December 31, 1985 for operations with fewer than 10 passenger seats (6) . The development and the rationale supporting those recommendations is the subject of this paper. GASP OBJECTIVE The primary GASP objective was, where found feasible subsequent to an analysis of the results of existing crashworthiness research, to develop recommended crash dynamic design stan- dards and to establish milestones for implementation of any developed recom- mendations into the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 23 applicable to general aviation aircraft. To ad- dress those objectives, a technical working group consisting of a broad representation of the manufacturing, regulatory, research and user constit- uency within general aviation were invited to meet voluntarily with the GASP. Those meetings were structured to permit the presentation of technical data by various specialists in the crash dynamics discipline, the evalua- tion of the respective technical data, the definition of an intermediate panel summary position, and delineation of goals and objectives and respective task assignments for the next GASP meeting. All of those proceedings were directed to satisfy the primary GASP objective. A topical review of the pertinent technical data used by the GASP technical working group to formulate their recommendations fol- lows : TECHNICAL DATA REVIEW The technical data gleaned from the active participation of several researchers in the GASP deliberations were progressively analyzed in concert to formulate early candidate proposals regarding general avihtion seat design standards. Subsequent technical work- ing group task assignments and joint data reviews fostered the maturity of the early candidate proposals and led to the finalized GASP recommenda- tions. No one data source dominated the development of the GASP recommend- 4.414</page><page sequence="3">850853 ations, which represent the joint voice of all of the GASP participants and are reflective of the current state-of- the-art. The technical data review presented herein highlights the perti- nent issues considered and illustrates the logic and direction taken in formu- lating the GASP recommendations. U.S. ARMY DATA - Although the criteria of MIL-STD-1290 (7) and the practices of the U.S. Army's Crash Survival Design Guide were not followed verbatim, it was concluded that those documents would serve as a point of reference for comparable standards to be developed by the technical work- ing group of the GASP. Through use of their design guide, the U.S. Army has successfully improved the crash survivability of all of their newly designed flight vehicles. The U.S. Army through an intensive analysis of their aircraft accident records has defined basic impact scenarios and velocity change envelopes that are imposed as design conditions for the airplane, landing gear and occupant impact protection systems of their aircraft. The U.S. Army's service experience has found that the incor- poration of cr ashwor th i ness design features in their aircraft has proven to be cost effective even though some weight penalty is incurred. For ex- ample, the cr ashwor th i ness features of the U.S. Army's UH-60A Black Hawk helicopter represents 330 pounds of the 10,500 pounds vehicle gross weight. It was also noted that approx- imately one-half or less of the weight penalty was due to direct occupant protection design features while the remainder was due to the crash resis- tant fuel system installation. A review of three civil rotorcraft with a state-of-the-art occupant pro- tection system and a crash-resistant fuel system, but where the design stan- dards for those items were believed by the manufacture to be more represen- tative of the civil crash environment, found that a total weight penalty of 1.1 to 1.4 percent of the aircraft gross weight was incurred. Those weight penalties are slightly less than one-half of penalties incurred by the U.S. Army's military helicopters under roughly comparable circumstances. The GASP technical working group found the principles contained in the U.S. Army's Crash Survival Design Guide to be sound but questioned their direct application to civil aircraft. The GASP technical working group embraced the U.S. Army's design logic and de- cided to pursue the development of equivalent crash survival design stan- dards that would have application to civil aircraft. IMPACT SCENARIO - A review of the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) data files pertaining to general aviation accident investiga- tions and an analysis of other studies directed to identify probable cause and/or operational phase of the air- craft at the time of the accident were initiated to define general aviation aircraft impact scenarios. It was found that these data sources were qualitative in nature and that quanti- tative definitions of the aircraft's attitude and speed at time of impact were generally unavailable. The NTSB is currently documenting those and other parameters that might provide a quantitative definition of general aviation aircraft; impact scenarios for, however, those data had yet to be fully analyzed or published (8). Thus the form and content of the cur- rent data bank for general aviation accidents did not facilitate the defin- ition of basic design conditions such as the quantitative impact scenarios and/or velocity change envelopes found in the U.S. Army's Crash Survival Design Guide. The FAA Technical Center and a contractor who was represented on the GASP technical working group had just completed an in-depth study of U.S. civil rotorcraft accidents (9). Light civil rotorcraft and general aviation aircraft do possess some similarities in airframe structure and occupant seating; therefore, those data were evaluated by GASP for potential appli- cation to general aviation aircraft. A composite plot of vertical and longitudinal impact velocities for U.S. civil rotorcraft found in the aforementioned study is illustrated in Figure 1. The depicted velocities are impact velocities at time of impact and are not necessarily the velocity changes experienced during the primary impact. For example, the longitudinal velocity change at the primary impact can differ significantly from the in- itial longitudinal impact velocity since the former is dependent on impact angle, slide-out distance, nose plow- ing, and obstruction encounters among other factors. The vertical velocity change experienced at the primary im- pact in the absence of rebound, how- ever, typically equals the initial vertical impact velocity since ground contact arrests the vertical impact velocity. Figure 1 provides insight regard- 4.415</page><page sequence="4">Figure 1- Accident survivability for longitudinal-vertical impact velocity components. ing the relationship between initial impact velocities, velocity change envelopes and survivable accident lim- its. That figure and others found in reference 9 were evaluated by GASP as a point of departure in defining velocity change envelopes and surviv- able accident limits representative for general aviation aircraft. There are recognized differences between the initial impact conditions of civil rotorcraft and general avia- tion aircraft. Those differences are a function of the differing operational and flight characteristics of those vehicles. The candidate general avia- tion aircraft velocity-change envelopes that were derived from the U.S. civil rotorcraft study in turn were corre- lated with the results of the FAA/NASA full-scale general aviation aircraft impact test program to develop those candidate design conditions and to confirm the established survivable accident limits for application to general aviation aircraft. FULL-SCALE AIRCRAFT IMPACT TESTS The FAA/NASA full-scale controlled impact test program provided valuable insight with regard to impact pulse shapes, pulse duration, maximum decel- eration levels and survivable accident limits for general aviation aircraft impacts. Pulse Shape - Some typical time histories of normal and longitudinal decelerations recorded during the full- scale controlled impact tests are shown in Figure 2. As depicted on those figures, a triangular pulse shape can be used as an approximation of the measured pulse shapes. To fur ter evalu- Figure 2- Typical time histories of normal and longitudinal general aviation decelerations. ate the pulse shape, NASA developed analytical relationships between the normal and longitudinal impact impulses and the respective primary velocity changes experienced at impact for the full-scale impact test cases. Figure 3 (2) illustrates the determined rela- tionship between the calculated normal impulses and three curves analytically derived with assumed pulse shapes. As can be seen, the assumed triangular pulse shape best approximates the cal- culated impulse data. The measured normal impulse and velocity change data were plotted in Figure 4 (2) against a curve that was derived ana- lytically with an assumed triangular pulse shape; note that the triangular pulse shape approximation is found to fit the data. Those data reviews supported the early selection of a triangular pulse shape for general Z At, sec a, max 10 [ ===1 ANALYTICAL y / / 8" • NASA G. A.

A similar review of longitudinal impulse data resulted in identical findings. Pulse Duration - A representative impact pulse duration was sought. Again an analysis of the full-scale impact test data yielded a candidate pulse duration.

Figure 6 (11) shows the full range of normal pulse durations record- ed during the full-scale impact test program. Subsequent to review of those data a candidate pulse duration of . 10 second was selected to be repre- sentative of a typical general aviation aircraft crash event.

A similar an- alysis of longitudinal pulse durations also led to the selection of a candi- date .10 second pulse duration. Figure 7- Comparison of Impact Velocity Envelopes Survivable Accident Limits - the full-scale impact test data were also used to evaluate the survivable limits of general aviation aircraft impacts. Figure 7 (12) presents an estimate of those survivable limits and their relationships to the aforementioned FAA Technical Center civil rotorcraft accident studies- as well as military estimates. That figure shows that the defined civil rotorcraft survivable accident limits, when compared to the full-scale general aviation impact tests results, may be a reasonable approximation of general aviation air- craft survivable accident limits. The data presented in Figure 7 provided a basis for the selection of the candi- 4.417</page><page sequence="6">date combined vertical/longitudinal velocity change of 31 feet per second that is depicted on that figure. A summary review of comparable military design criteria, the civil rotorcraft survivable accident limits, the full-scale impact test data, human injury limits and various parametrical studies led to the selection of a can- didate longitudinal impact velocity change of 42 ft/sec. The results of the FAA/NASA full- scale general aviation impact tests depicted in Figure 8 (2) and the loca- tion of the candidate longitudinal impact velocity change on that figure demonstrates that all but two of the FAA/NASA general aviation aircraft impact test data points are of a lesser value than the proposed candidate. Those two test data points were found to represent impact test conditions Figure 8- Experimental and calculated longitudinal-impulse data for airplanes. where no liveable cabin volume was maintained . Also as shown on Figure 9 (13) the candidate longitudinal impact vel- ocity change should generate shoulder belt loads that approach the 1750 pounds maximum shoulder belt load limit proposed by GASP for performance/injury criteria, which are discussed in a latter section of this paper. The candidate vertical and longi- tudinal impact velocity changes refer- red to herein were evaluated in the general aviation aircraft seat dynamic tests that were conducted as part of Figure 9- Relationship between shoulder belt load and longitudinal velocity change. the GASP deliberations. Seat structur- al performance and injury potential also were evaluated in that test ser ies . PARAMETRICAL STUDIES - A series of various analytical studies were conducted to assess what effects impact pulse shapes may have on seat/occupant response. One such study is illus- trated in Figure 10 (14) . That figure relates various vertical velocity Figure 10- Peak vertical acceleration versus vertical velocity change for various pulse shapes. change pulse shapes, the resultant peak acceleration, and the seat stroke requirements that would be necessary to limit spinal loads. If one views seat stroke requirements as a measure of the energy absorption level required to limit spinal loads, where seat strok- ing is assumed to occur at a 12g limit, it can be seen that for a given verti- cal velocity change the proposed sym- metrical triangular pulse results in the maximum vertical acceleration and seat stroke requirement. For example, 4.418</page><page sequence="7">850853 a 40 feet per second velocity change with a .10 second duration and a half- sine pulse results in 19.5 g's peak and requires a 5.6 inches seat stroke at the 12 g's limit, whereas for the same initial conditions a symmetrical triangular pulse results in 24.8 g's peak and requires a 6.5 inches seat stroke. Thus, for a given vertical velocity change requirement, the pro- posed symmetrical triangular pulse shape maximizes the seat stroke design requirements that should provide the maximum occupant spinal injury protec- tion. Analysis of the data depicted in Figure 10 also indicates that if other than a symmetrical triangular impact pulse shape is used seat dynamic testing should be conducted at higher impact velocities to achieve equivalent occupant spinal injury protection levels .

A similar analysis, which is sum- marized in Figure 11 (14), was per- formed to assess the effects of various vertical impact pulse durations. As one might expect, the peak acceleration increases as the pulse duration is shortened when the velocity change is held constant. The increased re- sponse requires an increased seat stroke requirement to achieve an equi- valent occupant spinal injury protec- tion level. The pulse durations meas- ured in the controlled-impact tests of general aviation aircraft ranged from .050 seconds to .15 seconds. The GASP deliberations led to the selec- tion of an impact pulse duration of .10 seconds, where Figure 6 shows that duration to approximate the median pulse duration. A parallel parametrical study was conducted using the general avia- tion seat/occupant digital computer program SOMLA (15) (16) . That study evaluated both the occupant response and the strength characteristics of a general aviation aircraft seat. Program SOLMA uses a lumped mass oc- cupant model combined with a seat fi- nite structural element model. The model used in the GASP parametrical study is a production general aviation aircraft seat that was used with some success in the development and valida- tion of digital computer program SOMLA (17) .

NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD DATA REVIEW - The National Trans- portation Safety Board (NTSB) is cur- rently conducting a study regarding General Aviation Crashwor thiness (18) . That study, which makes use of the 1982 airplane accident data base, evalu- ated the accident histories of small, contemporary, monocoque-structure air- planes. The NTSB Phase Two study is structured to define the impact sever- ity of survivable accidents and to estimate the benefits to be derived from the availability and use of shoul- der harnesses and energy absorbing seats. The accident data base was limited to those general aviation air- craft accidents where at least one occupant was fatally or seriously in- jured. Aircraft accidents where occu- pants received minor or no injuries typically occur at low impact velocity or are a ground operation mishap and provide little or no useful crashworthi- ness data. Nonsurv i vable accidents occur at impact severity levels that exceed human impact injury limits and /or the structural integrity of the airframe; hence, their usefulness in crashwor thiness studies is limited. The current NTSB studies are di- rected to estimate the number of fatal or serious injuries that could have been prevented if shoulder harnesses of energy absorbing seats were avail- able and used in survivable general aviation aircraft accidents. Detailed injury data were collected and analyzed for each occupant in the data sample. The analyst then made a judgmental estimate regarding the extent that fatalities or injuries could either have been prevented or made less se- rious by the use of a shoulder harness or energy absorbing seats. Table 4 (18) summarizes the NTSB findings for survivable general avia- TABLE 4 Occupants in Survivable Accidents: Potential Benefits of Shoulder Harness Use Original Injury Expected Distribution Distribution With Shoulder Harnesses Percent Fatal 214 Fatal 51 24 Serious 106 50 Minor/None 57 26 Serious 229 Serious 49 21 Minor/None 180 79 Minor 63 Minor 32 51 None 31 49 Total Fatal and Total who Serious 443 benefited 364* 82 * The 364 number is compiled from the 106 occupants coded fatal to serious, the 57 occupants coded fatal to minor/none, the 180 occupants coded serious to minor/none, and 21 occupants out of 49 who were coded serious to serious but would have had less serious injuries. tion aircraft accidents. That table suggests that shoulder harnesses may prevent 76 percent of the fatalities and 79 percent of the original serious injuries found in the survivable acci- dent data sample. Overall 82 percent of those occupants who experienced fatalities or serious injuries in sur- vivable accidents may receive a signif- icant benefit in terms of injury reduc- tion through shoulder harness use. A similar analysis was conducted to define the potential fatality/injury reduction benefit that might be achieved if energy absorbing seats were made available. Energy absorbing seats reduce the occurrence of spinal injuries, which are rarely fatal except in the case where they are debilitating and prevent post-impact emergency evacu- ation of the aircraft. The NTSB study (18) indicated that about 2 percent of the data sample fatalitieá may have been prevented if energy absorbing seats had been available. However, energy absorbing seats are more effec- tive in preventing serious neck and back injuries, and the NTSB study found that about 38 percent of the occupants who had serious injuries may be expect- ed to have had significantly less seri- ous injuries if they had been seated in an energy absorbing seat. These NTSB studies provide a basis for subsequent cost/benefit analysis, which must be conducted prior to regu- latory adoption of the GASP recommend- ations . PERFORMANCE CRITERIA An integral part of any test pro- cedure is the definition of some form of pass/fail criteria. The GASP tech- nical working group addressed the pass/ fail criteria by defining a performance 4.420</page><page sequence="9">850853 criteria that directly relates selected parameters measured during the dynamic test to an injury criteria that is based on human impact injury limits. The proposed performance criteria eval- uate the occupant/seat protection sys- tem's potential for preventing or min- imizing injuries from both primary and secondary impacts and from other occupant skeletal-loads. The GASP technical working group evaluated several candidate human im- pact injury criteria that addressed all areas of the human body such as the head, chest, lower torso and ex- tremities. Data sources consisted of military specifications, federal motor vehicle safety standards and the open literature. It was concluded that the performance criteria should ideally protect an occupant from debil- itating injuries. The performance criteria should also be easily and repeatedly measured for practical ap- plication and user acceptance. A recent study concerning civil rotorcraft crash dynamics identified the frequency of injury distribution by body region. A review of those data shown in Figure 12 (9) led to the selection of performance criteria that were directed at limiting head, chest and spinal injuries. Figure 12- Frequency of major and fatal injuries to each body region as per- centages of total major and fatal injuries in survivable accidents. HEAD INJURY CRITERIA - Secondary head impacts that represent debilitat- ing injuries can result in concussion and unconsciousness. The most widely used and accepted measure of potential head injury is the Head Injury Criteria (HIC) , which is used as a head injury criteria in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Sandard (FMVSS) No. 208 (19) (25). That criterion, which was pro- posed by Versace, is an alternate in- terpretation of the Wayne State Univer- sity Concussion Tolerance Curve (20) (21). The HIC is a weighted impulse integral between a selected initial and final time interval that contains the maximum value of the resultant acceleration at the center of mass of the head. The mathematical expres- sion of HIC is found below, where the suggested integration time interval is limited to not greater than 0.05 seconds and the maximum value of the integral should not exceed 1000. The GASP proposal recommends that the HIC be applied when the results of the seat dynamic tests find that structure and/or other equipment items are within the occupant's head strike envelope. That determination could be made by replicating in the dynamic test any structure and/or other equip- ment items found in the proximity of the occupant. The head's acceleration time history would then be measured during the dynamic test and evaluated with the HIC should secondary impact occur . An alternate evaluation could be made through an analysis of a high- speed motion picture film record of the seat dynamic test to determine the head strike envelope and, subse- quently, the point of impact and the head velocity at instant of impact, should it occur. The potential for head injury would then be determined by the procedure found in SAE Recom- mended Practice SAE J921b and other related procedures (22) . CHEST INJURY - Various criteria have been proposed by biomechanical researchers, but most require complex measurement devices and judicious anal- ysis of the resultant measured data. Chest deflection limits and chest accel- eration time history analyses and cor- relation with an acceptance standard are typical examples of chest injury criteria used by evaluators (23) , (24) and (25). The GASP considered many chest injury criteria, and shoulder belt load was selected as a means of evalu- ating the potential of chest injury. That criterion was suggested by Ep- pinger (26) , who, subsequent to a se- ries of cadaver tests and analysis of automotive accidents, proposed a shoulder belt load limit that would produce the minimum average number of fractures in the automobile fatality population used in his study. GASP proposed that a shoulder belt load limit of 1750 pounds be used as a performance criteria for assessing potential of chest injury. Table 5 (27) contains a range of shoulder belt loads that formed the basis for the GASP recommendation. Those proposed 4.421</page><page sequence="10">TABLE 5 SHOULDER BELT LOAD FOR AIS 3 INJURY LEVEL AGE GROUP SHOULDER BELT LOAD &lt;31 years 850 to 900 daN ^ 1900 - 2000 lb 35 to 50 years ^ 600 to 800 daN 1350 - 1800 lb &gt;50 years - - 500 to 600 daN 1 100 - 1350 lb These loads being proposed as the limiting values above which one person out of two may suffer injuries of AIS 3 or more in the scale proposed. loads are the limiting values above which one person out of two may suffer injuries of the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 3 or more. The recommended 1750 pounds shoulder belt load limit provides a reasonable injury protection level, which can be practically achieved as demonstrated during the GASP general aviation seat dynamic tests feasibility study. The shoulder belt load limit is simple, effective and easily measured during the dynamic test. The shoulder belt load also is highly dependent on belt geometry, and the usage of it as a performance criteria encourages restraint system designs that minimize restraint system loads on the occupant. SPINAL INJURY - As depicted in Figure 12, spinal injuries are frequent- ly incurred in aircraft crash events. The Dynamic Response Index (DRI) , which is based on a single lumped-mass, damp- ed spring model of the spine and respec- tive supported mass, has traditionally been used to predict probability of spinal injury in the performance eval- uation of aircraft ejection seats and others (1). DRI has been correlated with ejection seat testing and service experience to provide a level of con- fidence for that application. However, inherent differences in function, geom- etry, dynamic pulse exposure and occu- pant restraint between general aviation aircraft seats and ejection seats, and the difficulty of selecting the most representative acceleration meas- urement point in the occupant/seat systems makes direct application of DRI as a performance criteria for gen- eral aviation aircraft seats question- able . A more recent study conducted at the FAA Civil Aeronautical Institute related DRI determined from measured accelerations at the seat pan to pelvic load measured in the spinal base of a modified Part 572 anthropomorphic dummy. That relationship, which was developed through a series of dynamic tests of energy absorbing seats with a variety of impact orientations, is 3 1- + PROBABILITY OF SPINAL INJURY 5% i 20% 50% o 1 1 I LJ J I I L. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 SEAT PAN DRI Figure 13- Seat pan dri versus pelvis load. shown in Figure 13 (28) (29) . GASP recommended that a 1500 pounds pelvic load be used as a per- formance criterion to assess the prob- ability of spinal injury in evaluating the results of the proposed seat dynam- ic tests. The selected injury criteri- on, which is associated with a low probability of spinal injury, is a straightforward, easily measured quan- tity that requires no additional anal- ysis and/or interpretation. A more comprehensive discussion of performance criteria and their ra- tionale can be found in Reference 29. SEAT DYNAMIC TEST SERIES Subsequent to the definition of two candidate seat dynamic test condi- tions, the GASP technical working group recommended that the technical feasibil- ity of those candidates be evaluated via a series of dynamic tests. The seat dynamic tests would establish a baseline performance level for cur- rent production general aviation air- craft seats and provide an assessment of the design effort and technology level required to satisfy the dynamic test requirements. The technical feasi- bility dynamic test series would also demonstrate the appropriateness of the proposed pass/fail criteria. Accordingly, a dynamic test pro- gram for general aviation seats was devised, and the test series was con- ducted in January 1984 at the FAA 1 s Civil Aeronautical Institute in Okla- homa City, Oklahoma. The initial test series consisted of twenty-five indivi- dual dynamic tests distributed between the two candidate test conditions. Twelve different seat configurations from six aircraft manufacturers were evaluated. A comprehensive discussion related to that test program and its 4.422</page><page sequence="11">850853 findings can be found in a technical paper to be presented by Mr. R. F. Chandler of CAMI at the 1985 SAE Gen- eral Aviation Aircraft Meeting and Exposition (29) . Figure 14- Typical general aviation aircraft seat pretest configuration for 42 ft/sec longitudinal case. A dynamic test configuration for a general aviation aircraft seat is shown in Figure 14 (29) . A Part 572 anthropomorphic dummy occupied each seat and was restrained by a snugly adjusted combined lap-belt/upper torso restraint system. Two specimens of each seat configuration were available for testing. One specimen was subject- ed to a candidate seat dynamic test condition that emphasized a longitud- inal impact and the other was subjected to a second candidate that emphasized a combined vertical and longitudinal impact. Seat failure modes, seat/floor attachment strength, occupant response, and skeletal loads were among the qual- ities evaluated. A majority of the seats dynamical- ly tested exhibited some localized structural fracture, usually at a point of load concentration such as a joint and/or an attachment area. An analysis of each fracture area indicated that a simple redesign of an individual fitting or attachment joint would most likely eliminate the experienced frac- ture. A few seat configurations were modified selectively to evaluate that contention, and those modified seat configurations when tested successfully passed the candidate dynamic test con- ditions . Not all of the seats dynamically tested met the occupant protection performance criteria. Again, it was concluded that practical design solu- tions were available to enable modified and/or redesigned seats to meet the proposed occupant protection perform- ance criteria. For example, incorpor- ation of a realistic amount of energy absorption capability in the seat struc- ture could relieve the occupant spinal loads, and relocation of the upper attach point for the upper-torso por- tion of the restraint system could likewise relieve the restraint system loads on the occupant. Subsequent to analyses of the dynamic test results, the GASP techni- cal working group found that both of the proposed candidate seat dynamic test conditions were technically feas- ible and were within current state-of- the-art design capabilities. Those candidate seat dynamic test conditions were subsequently recommended as design standards by the GASP. OCCUPANT RESTRAINT SYSTEM STANDARD The GASP proposed seat dynamic test standards are based on a premise that upper torso restraint devices, or shoulder harnesses, will be a re- quired equipment item on all FAR Part 23 general aviation aircraft manufac- tured after December 31, 1984. The existing occupant restraint system technical standard order does not con- tain standards for upper torso re- straints (30) . The FAA has petitioned the Aerospace Council of the Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. to estab- lish an SAE Ad Hoc Upper Torso Re- straint System Committee to develop an SAE standard for an upper torso restraint system, suitable for use by passengers and crew members of gen- eral aviation airplanes and rotor- craft. That SAE standard would serve as a basis for a new technical standard order (TSO) to be developed on a prior- ity basis by the Federal Aviation Ad- ministration. That new SAE standard is intended to merge with the seat/ restraint system dynamic test criteria proposed by GASP. An SAE ad hoc committee was estab- lished, and that committee has develop- ed and has submitted to the SAE Aero- space Council a draft aerospace stan- dard for an aircraft torso restraint system (31). That new SAE aerospace standard was developed through an ex- tensive review and analysis of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, FMVSS 209; the Federal Air Regulations, Parts 21 and 23; the results of the GASP general aviation, aircraft seat dynamic test series and current torso restraint system design standards (civ- il and military) . OVERVIEW GASP RECOMMENDATION The General Aviation Safety Panel 4.423</page><page sequence="12">submitted to the FAA in May 1984 its proposal for enhanced crash tolerance for small FAR Part 23 general aviation aircraft with fewer than 10 passenger seats, whose application for initial type certification is made after Decem- ber 31, 1985, That proposal was form- ulated subsequent to thoughtful delib- eration by the GASP technical working group and is based on FAA and NASA research, extensive aircraft and seat dynamic testing, studies by the FAA 1 s Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI), analysis of general aviation accidents by the National Transportation Safety Board, the experiences of manufacturers of general aviation aircraft and mili- tary helicopters and the activities of private organizations specializing in crash dynamics. The proposal repre- sents realistic conditions that can be implemented in FAR Part 23, and the defined standards whould not impose an unreasonable economic hardship on either the general aviation aircraft manufacturers or the users of those a i rcraf t . Dynamic test standards have been recommended because they can demon- strate both occupant response and seat/ restraint system structural perform- ance. Dynamic tests provide a more representative evaluation of the occu- pant/seat/restraint system interaction, yield data for impact injury analysis and provide data to assess the function of an energy absorber system where provided . These tests are to be conducted with a 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 572, 50th percentile (170 pounds) anthropomorphic dummy. That anthropomorphic dummy is an accepted industry standard that provides a level of repeatability. The selection of the 170 pounds, 50th percentile, design veight would provide the most injury protection for the widest range of occupant weights. For example, a seat design optimized for a lightweight occupant, i.e. 5th percentile, could bottom out or collapse if occupied by a significantly heavier occupant. A seat design optimized for a heavy- weight occupant, i.e. 95th pertentile, may not stroke nor absorb any impact energy and thus impart injurious spinal loads if occupied by a significantly lighter occupant. Two distinct dynamic test condi- tions were recommended. A dynamic test condition with a combined vertical/longitudinal veloc- ity change of not less than 31 feet per second was proposed by GASP. The velocity vector is oriented (30° from the vertical) such that the occupant/ seat/restraint system is subjected to a vertical velocity change of 26.8 feet per second combined with a longi- tudinal velocity change of 15.5 feet per second. That test condition empha- sizes occupant vertical loading and evaluates the means provided to reduce spinal loading and injury under the combined vertical/longitudinal load environment typically generated by a crash event. A second dynamic test condition with a longitudinal velocity change of not less than 42 feet per second was proposed to provide an assessment of the occupant restraint system and seat structural performance. GASP proposed that the means for seat attachment must be misaligned during the dynamic tests by at least 10 degrees vertically to ensure that the seat and its means of attachment are tolerant to a reasonable level of floor warpage, which may occur dur- ing a crash event. Pass/fail performance criteria that relate human impact injury limits to measurable test parameters have been included in the GASP recommenda- tions. Those performance criteria have been selected to ensure that the occupant/seat/restraint system responds in a manner that reduces fatalities/in- juries in survivable crash events. The GASP proposal also includes an option to depart from the proposed standards should one elect to use an alternate approach that achieves the same or equivalent level of impact safety and can be substantiated on a rational basis. That option does not eliminate the need to conduct a dynamic test of the occupant/seat/ restraint system, however; it only provides an applicant with the freedom to establish a floor pulse that is derived from a test/analytical program that considers the impact and energy absorption characteristics of a partic- ular aircraft. For example, the alter- nate approach may have merit where impact energy management is emphasized below the cabin floor in a manner that can lengthen the floor pulse above that established by the GASP technical working group for current generation general aviation aircraft. Once de- fined, the alternate floor pulse could be used to conduct the seat dynamic test . The cost/benefits from the im- proved crash tolerance represented by the proposed dynamic standards should prove to be significant, assum- ing that loss of life has an average 4.424</page><page sequence="13">850853 negative economie impact of $530,000 and that serious injuries result in a negative economic impact of $38,000. The GASP proposal was formally presented at the Small Airplane Air- worthiness Review Conference in St. Louis, Missouri on October 22, 1984. That proposal can be found in FAA Docket No. 23494, Small Airplane Air- worthiness Review Program (6) . The complete text of the GASP recommendations regarding dynamic test- ing of seats is found in the appendix of this paper. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Realistic dynamic performance standards for general aviation aircraft seats which emphasize occupant impact protection and which are based on a comprehensive analyses of full-scale aircraft impact tests, general aviation aircraft accident data analyses and a dynamic test program of general avi- ation seats have been defined. Those performance standards take the form of two dynamic test conditions. A combined (vertical/longitudinal velocity change) dynamic test condition that emphasizes occupant vertical loads and energy management has been defined. A second (longitudinal velocity change) dynamic test condition that emphasizes the performance of the occu- pant/restraint/seat retention chain has also been defined. Pass/fail performance criteria that relate human impact injury limits to measurable test parameters have been established. NTSB estimates based on an analy- sis of accident data indicate that implementation of the newly defined standards would significantly reduce fatalities and the extent of serious injuries in survivable accidents of aircraft that incorporated the proposed seat dynamic performance standards. The new seat dynamic performance standards have been formally submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration for incorporation into Part 23 of the Federal Aviation Regulations with a recommendation that they apply to new aircraft with application for type certification dated after December 31, 1985. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of the General Avia- tion Safety Panel and its technical working group who enthusiastically participated in the development of the dynamic standards for general avia- tion aircraft seats.

APPENDIX TEXT OF GENERAL AVIATION SAFETY PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS DYNAMIC TESTING OF SEATS - Recom- mended seat criteria for small general aviation aircraft applying for initial type certification after December 31, 1985 for operations with fewer than 10 passenger seats. (a) Each seat, bench or other device for crew or passenger occupancy must successfully complete dynamic tests with an occupant weight of 170 pounds in accordance with each of the conditions stated below: (1) A change of velocity of not less than 31 feet per second when the seat, bench or other seating device is oriented in its nominal position with respect to the aircraft's refer- ence system and the aircraft's longi- tudinal axis is canted upward 60 de- grees with respect to the impact veloc- ity vector and the aircraft's lateral axis is perpendicular to a vertical plane containing the impact velocity vector and the aircraft's longitudinal axis. For the aircraft's first row of seats, peak deceleration must occur in not more than .05 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 19 g's. For all other seats, peak deceleration must occur in not more than .06 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 15 g's. (2) A change in velocity of not less than 42 feet per second when the seat, bench or other seating device is oriented in its nominal position with respect to the aircraft's refer- ence system and the aircraft's longi- tudinal axis is yawed 10 degrees either right or left of the impact velocity vector (but in such a way as to cause the greatest load on the upper torso restraint system) , the aircraft's later- al axis is contained in a horizontal plane containing the impact velocity vector and the aircraft's vertical axis is perpendicular to a horizontal plane containing the impact velocity vector. For the aircraft's first row of seats, peak deceleration must occur in not more than .05 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 26 g's. For all other seats, peak deceleration must occur in not more than .06 seconds after impact and must reach a minimum of 21 g's. (Note: The aircraft's reference system is defined as consisting of three mu- tually perpendicular axes where the vertical axis is perpendicular to a waterline reference system of the air- craft and parallel to the station ref- erence system and the longitudinal axis is perpendicular to the station reference system. The velocity change shall be pure translation with no angu- lar acceleration considered.) (3) The floor rails used to attach the seating device to the airframe must be misaligned with respect to each other by at least 10 degrees ver- tically (i.e. out of parallel), with the direction at the option of the manufacturer, to account for floor warp. (4) Dynamic tests in accordance with the conditions stated in paragraph (a), subparagraphs (1) , (2) and (3) are considered to be successfully com- pleted when the performance measures (4a) through (4f) are demonstrated. (4a) Loads in individual upper torso straps do not exceed 1,750 pounds. If dual straps are used for retaining the upper torso, the total 4.427</page><page sequence="16">strap loads do not exceed 2,000 pounds. (4b) The maximum pelvic load as measured in a 49 CRF 572 dummy does not exceed 1,500 pounds. (4c) The occupant's upper torso strap or straps remain on or in the immediate vicinity of the occupant's shoulder during the impact. (4d) The lap belt remains on the occupant's pelvis during the impact. (4e) The occupant's head either does not contact any portion of the cockpit or cabin or if it does, the head impact does not exceed a Head Impact Criteria (HIC) of 1,000, as determined by the test procedures de- fined in SAE J921. ( 4 f ) The attachment between the seating device and the aircraft's struc- ture remains intact (although the struc- ture can have exceeded its limit load) and the restraint system remains intact (although it also can have experienced separation that is intended as part of its design) as long as the condi- tions contained in (4a) , (4b) , (4c) , (4d) and (4e) are met. (b) In addition to the dynamic tests and criteria defined in paragraph (a) and its subparagraphs (1) through (4f ) , all seats, benches or other seat- ing devices and its supporting struc- ture must be designed to withstand the static loads imposed by a 215-pound occupant when subject to the aircraft's design loads as defined in the air- craft's approved flight/ground enve- lope. (c) Paragraphs (a) and (b) above specify a minimum standard for new aircraft with application for type certification dated after December 31, 1985. An applicant for a type certificate has the option to depart from the criteria presented in para- graphs (a) and (b) above provided an alternate approach that achieves the same or equivalent level of occupant crash tolerance can be substantiated on a rational basis. MANDATORY EQUIPAGE OF SHOULDER HARNESSES - The General Aviation Safety Panel affirms its earlier recommenda- tion that all FAR Part 23 general avia- tion aircraft manufactured after Decem- ber 31 , 1984 be equipped with upper torso restraint systems. We further recommend that the FAA consider ways to facilitate the installation of upper torso restraint systems in older gener- al aviation aircraft, and that the FAA work with the SAE Upper Torso Re- straint Committee to formulate accept- able standards for harness material and attachments to be used in aircraft manufactured after December 31, 1985. t2 2.5 HIC=(t9-t1) 1 a(t)dt &lt; 1000 *2 ^1 *1 4.428</page></plain_text>
