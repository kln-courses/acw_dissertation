<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Archaeological Evidence on North-West Indo-Pakistan (3rd-lst millennia B.C.) by Giorgio Stacul Recent archaeological researches and excavations in the north-west regions of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent have extended the evidence for several protohistoric cultures attested in this geographic area, especially in the Sw?t Valley where the work of the Italian Archaeological Mission (IsMEO) has been carried out. 1. Evidence of pottery cultures preceding the period of the Indus Civilization in the regions lying between the slopes of the Hindukush and those of the Karakorum, comes from the Sw?t and Kashmir Valleys. We refer to the cultural horizon attested by the lower archaeological layers in the rock shelter near Gh?ligai (layers 24-21) (*) and to the Neolithic phase I of Burzahom near Srinagar (2). Radiocarbon analyses calculated on a half-life of 5730 years and readjusted with MASCA corrections, have given dates for the respective phases which go back to the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C. Although partially contemporary, the above cultures do not appear to have any fea? tures in common. The pottery of Gh?ligai shows some similarities with common vase shapes in chalcolithic sites of Turkmenia (3); as regards the Burzahom horizon, especially its stone and bone industry, some probable links have been found with neolithic cultures of northern China (4). 2. The Sw?t Valley for the moment represents the northernmost limes of the sub? continent reached by the Indus Civilization, or at least by a culture closely related with Harapp?. We refer to the distinctive cultural horizon of layer 19 of Gh?ligai, which is characterized by pinkish painted and wheel-turned ware, very fine in fabric and in tex? ture (5). However, no evidence has been found on the same site of pottery ware connected (*) The photographs are by the Author. They are filed in the archives of the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Orientale, Rome.

In the Gh?ligai shelter, pinkish fine ware is followed by red-washed ware, as attested by layer 18. The latter has already been compared with the red-washed or ochre coloured pottery (OCP) typical of many north Indian sites, in particular of Gang?-Yumun? Doab (9). As regards this Sw?t horizon, it must be pointed out that in layer 18 at Gh?ligai, side by side with the red-washed ware, there are also fragments of fine red burnished ware which has some features in common with pottery from some sites in northern Baluchistan (10). As we shall see later, this is a type of ware which was to last until, or reappear in, a later period in the Sw?t Valley. 4. The mat- or basket-impressed ware, predominant in layers 17 and 18 at Gh?ligai, clearly indicates that a clean break was made with the preceding horizon. It points to a return to the production of coarse hand-made vases in a rather restricted number of shapes. In this connection, it has already been pointed out that affinities exist between this type of pottery and that of Neolithic period I of Burzahom in Kashmir, where this horizon is thought to have had a particularly long duration Nevertheless, the overlap of this culture in the Sw?t Valley did not perhaps bring about a complete interruption of all the previous pottery traditions, as we shall now see. 5. Very probably in the Kashmir Valley, as well as in the Sw?t Valley, there was a slow and gradual transition from the mat- or basket-impressed ware phase to the black grey burnished ware phase. We have already dealt with the probable components of the new cultural horizon (12), which marks the introduction of new pottery shapes including bowl-on-stand types that are particularly similar to specimens from Tepe His?r and from other sites of the Gorg?n Valley in north Iran. That this ware spread beyond the Kopet Dagh into southern Turkmenia is documented in sites such as Namazga-depe V or Ak depe (13), while of great interest are the recent finds made further to the east in the Akca nian oasis in north Afghanistan, in ancient Bactria. According to Sarianidi, they show clear links with sites like S?h-tepe II, Tureng Tepe III and Tepe His?r III (14). (6) M.R.

Also significant in this connection is the common use made of decoration with burnished ornaments where? by alternating bright and dull areas are produced on the body of the vase. Similar orna? mentation, often in the form of true zigzag motifs, is also found on black and gray ware vases of the same cultural period. These correlations with layer 18 of the Gh?ligai horizon, which became all the more apparent after the examination of pottery recently discovered in the lower layers of the Aligr?ma settlement (15), could be explained in two ways. It could be postulated, for instance, that in the Sw?t Valley, during the period characterized by the predominant basket-impressed ware phase, a culture and a pottery ware both linked to previous local tradition managed to keep alive. Alternatively it is conceivable that this continuity of tradition occurred outside this region, most likely in neighbouring zones to the south. This second and perhaps more plausible hypothesis would explain how at Damkot near Chak dara, not far from the Malakand Pass and thus from the plains (i.e. from the present dis? tricts of Mard?n and Peshawar), the cultural phase in question exhibits not only burnished black and grey ware but also a painted wheel-turned red ware in much larger percentages than in the contemporary sites further north (Gh?ligai layer 15, Barikot Ghundai, Loe banr III, Aligr?ma) (16). 6. Starting from the 14th or 13th century B.C. the majority of the north-west re? gions of the subcontinent came under the sway of a relatively unitary culture. The first evidence relating to the latter was gathered in the Sw?t Valley (1T) and then in the settle? ment of Ch?rsadda (18). It was followed by further evidence from the Dir region (19), the district of K?l?m (20) and the neighbourhood of Peshawar (21). The same culture with some variants seems to be attested also in northern Baluchistan (22). Characteristic elements of this culture, the evidence for which comes from graveyards (15) G Stacul, ?Excavation at Aligr?ma, Sw?t (1973)?, PkA (in the press). (16) On the excavation at Damkot near Chak dara see: A. Rahman, ? Excavation at Damkot ?, Ancient Pakistan, IV, 1968-69, pp. 103-250. The early occupation period at Damkot, with fine red and burnished grey ware, is probably referable to about the middle of the 2nd mil? lennium B.C. The period in question clearly precedes the early phase of occupation in the Balambat settlement and the most ancient graves in Loebanr, K?telai or Timargarha graveyards. (17) G.

It was a common custom to lay the cremated remains in anthropomorphic urns (figs. 1-3). The culture in question seems to be made up of a large number of components. In addition to correlations with the cultural horizon attested previously in the Sw?t Valley, there are also elements of a more recent Iranian derivation as well as other influences that can perhaps be traced back to cultures of the middle Bronze Age in Central-East Euro? pe (23). It is significant that some of the more common types of vase of the early period of this culture are documented in cremation graves in northern Baluchistan; this is clear evidence of the fact that the several regional variants of this culture spread over a wide area (24). Also significant is the fact that cremation predominated in the Steppe Bronze Age of south-west Tadjikistan as well (graveyards of the Vahs and Kafirnigan Val? leys) (25), even though the furnishings of the tombs allow only very generic comparisons to be made with those of contemporary graves in north Pakistan in spite of recent state? ments to the contrary (26). In any case, this tends to show that ? the second millennium B.C. was a period of great migration and population changes ?, as has been pointed out by V.M. Masson and V.l. Sarianidi, who also give meaning to ? certain parallels between the burial rites of the Steppe Bronze Age culture and the burial rites described in the Rig Veda ? (27). 7. In its gradual development, the above culture underwent changes in its material equipment and also in its burial rites. Thick-walled, disk-based vases were followed by thin walled, flat-based ones. New pottery shapes appear and incised decoration is predominant, consisting exclusively of geometric patterns. Unlike the previous phase, inhumation is now (-3) Stacul, ?

The correlations pertinent to the pot? tery, as indicated by Kuz'mina, concern mostly shapes lacking in specific peculiarities. The pot? tery production attested in the Sw?t Valley is vastly richer and more differentiated than that from the graveyards of south-west Tadjikistan. For this reason we believe that, as far as this field of production is concerned, the hypothesis of a culture influence in north Pakistan from Central Asia is not well founded. Another hypo thesis seems more likely, i.e. a western influence, from north-eastern Iran, both towards north Pa? kistan and towards south-west Tadjikistan. As for the comparisons of grave structure, we point out that the excavations carried out by M. Tad dei, Ch. Silvi Antonini and the author in the graveyards of Butkara II, Loebanr and K?telai have not revealed the presence of "dromos" graves. Nor has our excavation work in other valleys in north Pakistan ever revealed similar structures. In any case, graves with stone walls on two, three or all four sides of the pit are peculiar to the most recent period of the above graveyards, later than the 4th century B.C. For this reason, we do not think that they allow useful comparisons to be made with the graves of the Late Bronze Age in southwest Tadjikistan. See also Ch. Silvi Antonini, ?More about Sw?t and Central Asia?, EW, XXIII, 1973, pp. 235-244. (27) Masson, Sarianidi, op. cit., pp. 153 f. 242</page><page sequence="6">predominant as a burial rite. This phase, which shows signs of further influence from the regions of north Iran, runs from about the beginning of the 1st millennium to the 4th century B.C. (28). 8. In some graveyards of the Sw?t and Dir Valleys, the archaeological evidence reveals that the cultural phase characterized by the predominance of fine grey incised ware was followed by fine red incised ware characterized by new shapes such as hourglass beakers, spouted vessels, etc. Inhumation is much more frequent than cremation, while grave goods often include weapons and other iron objects (29). With a few variants this phase has been documented in the Buner and Chitr?l Valleys (30) and also at Zarif Kor?na in the Peshawar District (31). The available evidence is still insufficient to decide whether this cultural phase de? veloped out of the preceding cultural phase or whether it reflects the arrival of a new people and their partial assimilation of the local population. While it is true that the people using hourglass beakers continued to use the same cemeteries as those used during the preceding period, the same cannot be said for the settlements occupied by the incised grey ware people, where no documentation has yet been found for a similar horizon. Recent excavations in the Pamir area confirm the existence during this period of relations of a trading or other nature between the populations in the settlements on the opposite sides of the great mountain chains separating the sub-continent from Central Asia (32).
