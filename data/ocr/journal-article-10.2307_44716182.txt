Wilson Safety Research and Development Lab., General Motors Corp. LATE IN 1967, an interesting advertisement (1)* appeared in many American national magazines. Humorously, the ad (Fig. 1) pointed out the tragic inevitability that whenever hu- mans operate machines, accidents become a by-product. Cer- tain combinations of circumstances produce unwanted events that were not intended to be normal operating conditions for the machine. For the case of automobiles, these unplanned situations very often involve the collision of one or more vehi- *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. cles, producing deformation to the structure and, if the acci- dent is severe enough, injury or death to the occupants. Field observation of these accidents does not provide enough data to vehicle designers so that their engineering skills can be ap- plied to the reduction of accident injuries and fatalities, nor does engineering intuition fill the gap. Practical and effective designs require quantitative values: forces, displacements, tra- jectories, decelerations, injury indices, etc. The acquisition of these data requires testing- difficult, time-consuming, instru- mented testing. The purpose of this review, then, is to look at vehicle impact testing and see how it was started, how it has matured, and what its current problems are. ABSTRACT Vehicle impact testing, having its start over 30 years ago, has matured into a highly sophisticated operation which involves many disciplines. The older routines of running cars into things and only looking at aftereffects are no longer adequate to answer today's vehicle safety questions. Full-scale testing has been supplemented with impact sleds, component impact machines, and computer simulations. Human simulators, or dummies, are used as instrument carriers or as instruments themselves to provide some estimate of the injury that might be produced in various impact situations. All types of impact tests today demand complete, accurate, and immediate measurements of the physical events involved. Instrumentation has evolved which utilizes electronic, photo- graphic, and mechanical techniques to record and display im- pact events which, by their very nature, are over in tenths of seconds. Data reduction systems have been devised to shorten the time and reduce the man-hours necessary to make the data useful. Currently, the major limitations in vehicle impact testing ap- pear to lie in the area of incomplete human biomechanical in- formation. How to produce the impact is farther along than knowing what bodyform to impact against or impact with. How to obtain and record the data is less of a problem than how to interpret the results for injury potential. This paper presents a review of vehicle impact testing as it has evolved in the United States by discussing its history, its various forms, the measurements it requires, and the kinds of information it tries to provide. 1453</page><page sequence="2">1454 R.

EARLY BEGINNINGS It is difficult to discuss the beginning of automotive vehicle impact test work without briefly reflecting upon the more general subject of "crash-impact engineering." Very rarely can the start of a new engineering discipline be attributed to the efforts of one individual. However, such is the case for crash- impact engineering. Hugh DeHaven is credited in various ref- erences (2, 3) as being largely responsible for "initiating the modern concept of human tolerance to crash forces." His in- terest in the subject was kindled by a very graphic stimulant- his personal involvement in a mid-air collision during the early days (1917) of military aviation. Continued interest in crash safety culminated in his accepting a post as Research Associate with the Cornell University Medical College in 1942. This ini- tial association led to the establishment of the well-known Automotive Crash Injury Research (ACIR) project at Cornell University in 1952. Mr. DeHaven gave a warm, personal re- view of his career at the 1968 Stapp Car Crash Conference, the text of which can be found in the Proceedings of the Thirteenth Stapp Car Crash Conference (4). However, having a crash-impact point of view and develop- ing impact test techniques to support that point of view are two different things. In the literature, very few references are cited prior to World War II that describe any crash-impact test- ting; least of all, automotive related. The earliest impact tests involving automobiles appear to have taken place in the early 1930s, when General Motors Corp. conducted full-scale roll- over tests (Fig. 2) in 1933, prior to the introduction of the all- steel top construction (5). The roll was accomplished by driv- ing the car onto a spiral ramp located at the top of a hill. A short time later, ground level rollover tests were done by driv- ing the car into a skid on a sod field (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the first Chrysler Corp. tests also were roll- overs which were run in the 1930s (6). Their test was an end- over-end roll caused by pushing the vehicle off a steep cliff at Bald Mountain, northwest of Pontiac, Michigan. Car-to-barrier testing began in 1934, when GM ran a vehicle into a retaining wall (5). In that test (Fig. 4), the driver aimed the car at the barrier at a speed low enough so that he could jump out just before the impact. At the Ford Motor Co., glass impact studies were conducted as early as 1935 (7). A cartoon (Fig. 5) depicts tests run to evaluate "the relative impact resistance and energy absorbing capacity of glass." Preliminary safety criteria were the degree of shot-bag penetration and the weight of broken glass frag- ments. These references probably do not represent all the impact</page><page sequence="3">VEHICLE IMPACT TESTING 1455 Fig. 2 - Spiral-ramp rollover test test work that was carried out in the 1930s. However, they do illustrate that early automotive crash test work was quite rudi- mentary. The primary interest regarding the full-scale tests described was in the structural performance of the vehicle. The only data were obtained by looking at the wrecked car af- terward or by taking regular speed motion pictures during the event. There was no instrumentation, dummies were not avail- able, and high-speed photography was not in general use. Ve- hicle impact testing, although underway, lacked the test tech- niques and data-gathering know-how that had to be developed in order to answer the fundamental questions relating to occu- pant injury. IMPACT TESTING OUTLINE In trying to trace the subsequent development of vehicle im- pact test techniques, it soon became apparent that some sort of outline would be most helpful in keeping the discussion of the many facets of the subject in an orderly sequence. Such an outline might be structured as shown in Fig. 6. This is not intended to enumerate every possible impact test technique; Fig. 3 - Ground-level rollover test Fig. 4 - 1934 barrier test</page><page sequence="4">1456 R.A.WILSON Fig. 5 - Early glass testing rather, it tries to categorize broadly the basic methods being used today to test and evaluate vehicle and occupant impact situations. An initial breakdown of the subject area can be made simply by considering, first, those techniques used to produce the im- pact and, second, those techniques used to evaluate the results. This division seems appropriate to separate those things that are part of the input to the test from those things that are part of the output from the test. PRODUCING THE IMPACT The first half of the outline concerns producing the impact. It can be divided, in turn, into four major categories: 1 . Full-scale vehicle collisions. 2. Full-sized sled tests. 3. Laboratory component tests. 4. Impact models. The first three are related to each other in terms of the num- ber of vehicle components that affect the particular test objec- tives. For example, if the impact questions to be answered in- volve the crush of the vehicle structure, then a vehicle must be crushed during an actual collision. This collision can be with another vehicle, into some kind of barrier, or with the ground as in a rollover. If the questions to be answered only require that a given acceleration pulse be present, then a sled test can be employed. This category usually refers to controlled-decel- eration test devices having large enough test beds to carry com- plete car bodies or, at least, enough of the vehicle (seat or cowl or both) to allow full-dummy testing. When the ques- tions relate to a very specific part of the vehicle or to a partic- ular segment of the occupant subject, then a laboratory com- ponent test is adequate. It is interesting to note that as the complexity of the test VEHICLE IMPACT TEST TECHNIQUES __EZ¡ I PRODUCING EVALUATING THE IMPACT THE RESULTS r- =T - FULL-SCALE VEHICLE OCCUPANT SIMULATORS COLLISIONS (DUMMIES) FULL-SIZED ELECTRONIC SLED TESTS INSTRUMENTATION (~| LABORATORY COMPONENT -i PHOTOGRAPHIC TESTS INSTRUMENTATION IMPACT DATA MODELS ANALYSIS ZHHZlL Fig. 6 - Subject outline goes from the laboratory type to the full-scale collision type, the number of test variables is increased. This automatically causes a decrease in test repeatability. Because of this, vehicle impact testing has evolved to be a complementary mix of tech- niques that are complex where they have to be and simple where they can be. In all types of testing, however, it is important to remember that the ultimate goal is to represent, as closely as possible, the actual events experienced by a live occupant during a real accident. This does not mean that every situation can be reproduced and evaluated separately. Unfortunately, the pos- sible combinations approach infinity. Certain impact circum- stances must be selected as being most important to the under- standing of the basic question of saving lives and reducing injury. The last category classified as producing the impact concerns those studies involving impact models. These routines can be physical scale models or mathematical simulations of impacts that are covered by any of the first three categories. Although some scale-model work has been done, computer modeling has received by far the most effort. The value of computer simu- lations lies in their absolute repeatability and relatively low cost per run. Drawbacks to computer models are the difficul- ties of computing the complex crush dynamics of complete ve- hicle impacts and the problems of acquiring sufficient input information for the simulation. EVALUATING THE RESULTS The second half of the outline deals with evaluating the re- sults and has been separated into these four parts: 1 . Occupant simulators (dummies). 2. Electronic instrumentation. 3. Photographic instrumentation. 4. Data analysis. Some sort of occupant simulation is required in any vehicle impact test where the test results are to be interpreted in terms of the payoff to be realized under field accident condi- tions. This does not mean that a complete anthropomorphic dummy is necessary all the time, but it does require that ade-</page><page sequence="5">VEHICLE IMPACT TESTING 1457 Fig. 7 - One of the first UCLA-ITTE barrier tests Fig. 8 - 1950 car-to-bus test quate attention be given to the test equipment as it relates to human kinematics and biomechanics. The next two categories very often are used to complement one another. Electronic instrumentation, by itself, cannot provide all the answers from an impact test. Simultaneous, high-speed motion pictures of the event are very effective in explaining, for example, the ac- tual circumstance that produced a particular peak on a lap-belt load trace. The last item refers to data analysis techniques that could include anything from measuring the overall crush of a car using a tapemeasure to the most sophisticated com- puter routines that store, operate on, and plot the data from vehicle impact tests. These two parts, then, make up the field of vehicle impact testing: producing the impact and evaluating the results. Us- ing the outline of Fig. 6 as a guide, let us look at the literature and see how the various areas progressed from the early begin- nings discussed previously to the techniques in use today. FULL-SCALE VEHICLE COLLISIONS World War II delayed the further development of impact testing until the late 1940s and early 1950s, when two sepa- rate research teams began studying full-scale automotive colli- sions. These two groups were the Department of Engineering, University of California with D. M. Severy and J. H. Mathew- son, and the Motor Vehicle Research Center, Lee, New Hamp- shire with A. J. White. The first group was later to evolve into the UCLA-ITTE (University of California, Los Angeles- Insti- tute of Transportation and Traffic Engineering). Accounts of this early work with full-scale impacts reveal a surprising de- gree of sophistication considering the untried nature of the testing. The UCLA tests during the early 1950s might be described best by quoting several paragraphs from an early paper (8) by Severy and Mathewson: "A barrier 8 ft high and 14 ft wide was constructed of large- diameter utility poles backed by suitable cross members and braces and several tons of dirt. "A truck was used to push the instrumented car up to the desired speed, to provide a mobile position for the remote- control operator, and for carrying the Hathaway 12-channel recording oscillograph. The truck pulled the trailer used to carry the portable power unit. An electrical cable which could be paid out rapidly from the pushing vehicle linked the instru- ments in the two vehicles. The car was guided by remote con- trol to crash into the barrier (Fig. 7). Electronic, mechanical, and photographic instrumentation was used to record decel- erations, strains, and the other dynamic phenomena under ob- servation during the impact. "An instrumented human subject and an instrumented an- thropometric dummy, secured by a chest-type safety belt, sim- ulated the drivers of this 1937 Plymouth test car for the low- and high-speed tests, respectively." An interesting chronology of the early UCLA-ITTE experi- ments and related publications can be found in another paper (9) by Severy, et al. The New Hampshire tests are docu- mented in a book (10) by Andrew J. White that covers 15 years of vehicle safety research that began around 1950. It contains a pictorial record of the the techniques used at the Motor Vehicle Research Center (Fig. 8). Also during the early 1950s, extensive car-to-barrier and car-to-car collision tests were conducted at the Ford Motor Co. (11-15). A typical car-to-car intersection type collision is shown in Fig. 9. In some of these early tests, it was necessary to use gravel-filled</page><page sequence="6">1458 R.A.WILSON Fig. 9 - Early car-to-car impact bags as child test dummies (16) to simulate the child's size and weight (Fig. 10). These techniques represented tremendous advances over the prewar tests and, to a large degree, are still evident today. The main variance relating to actually producing the impact con- cerns the methods used to propel and guide the test vehicle. Remote steering rigs were employed by the early researchers (8, 10). This technique had the advantage of not being re- stricted to a single test site; however, it lacked the degree of impact position accuracy that was very soon recognized as necessary. Almost all full-scale collision testing today uses a guide-rail system similar to that described in a later UCLA- ITTE paper (17). A guide rail is fastened to the roadway in the desired direction. Its length is sufficient so that the power system can have enough distance to attain the desired speed. A guiding dolly which rides on the rail is fastened to the test vehicle structure. Later refinements have been made to pro- duce dolly arrangements that automatically uncouple from the test car just prior to impact. This general arrangement has proved to be the most effective way to aim the test vehicle to- ward the desired impact location. Various ways of propelling the test vehicle have been and still are used. Although specific references cannot be cited, the following list contains those methods known to the author to be used in this country: 1 . Allowing the test car to run under its own power using a suitable speed governor. 2. Pushing the test car with another vehicle which stops early, allowing the test car to proceed to the impact. 3. Allowing the test car to coast down a hill that is high enough to provide the desired speed. 4. Towing the test car with another vehicle using a discon- nectable cable, with or without a pulley system. 5. Towing the test car through a cable system that is pow- ered by a stationary winch. The more modern methods seem to be headed toward station- ary winch systems with very accurate speed control systems. Some of the impetus for this has come from the need to test at relatively precise speeds as related to the U. S. Motor Vehi- cle Safety Standards. OTHER FULL-SCALE TESTS As stated earlier in this paper, full-scale testing, because of the number of variables involved, tends to be less repeatable Fig. 10 - Gravel-filled-bag child test dummy Fig. 1 1 - Typical present-day rollover site than sled or laboratory testing. This is especially true for car- to-car impacts. Alternate test techniques have been developed in an attempt to improve the repeatability and reduce the ex- pense of vehicle-to-vehicle collision work. These current methods (18) employ so-called "moving barriers." For exam- ple, fuel tank integrity can be evaluated by impacting the test car in the rear with a flat-faced, weighted cart. Development work also has been carried out with other forms of moving barriers (that is, bumper-contoured, pole-shaped) that might be used to evaluate other areas of vehicle crush. More on this subject can be found in a Ford Motor Co. paper (19). One type of full-scale event presents unique problems; namely, vehicle rollover tests. Several methods of producing rollovers have already been mentioned and are summarized in an SAE Recommended Practice (20). However, none of those proved to be completely satisfactory. Tipping a car down a hill was sure to cause a rollover; however, the forward velocity was missing. Deliberate spin-outs on a sod field gave the de- sired velocity, but actual rollover was not assured. The tech- nique in use today (6) seems to give the desired action; that is, an assured roll with a known forward velocity. This method, largely developed by Chrysler Corp., uses a curved guide rail (Fig. 1 1) to direct the test car onto a 2-ft-high ramp. The test vehicle is towed at the desired speed along the rail. This combination of a vehicle in motion, a severe turn, and a ramp to lift the inside front wheel serves to produce the de-</page><page sequence="7">VEHICLE IMPACT TESTING 1459 Fig. 12 - Rollover simulator sired rolling action. Unfortunately, assuring a rollover does not assure a repeatable loading pattern on the top structure. The detailed rolling action still varies considerably from test to test. To help offset this variance in top structure loading, a sim- ple drop test procedure (21) has been developed. For this SAE Recommended Practice, a vehicle is suspended, upside- down, and dropped on its top from a specified height. A lab- oratory crush test (22) for top strength also has been devel- oped and adopted by SAE to simplify the measurement of force-deflection properties of the vehicle upper structure. Another problem concerning rollover testing is the observa- tion of the dummy occupant's kinematics during the roll. An interesting procedure (23) was developed at the Cornell Aero- nautical Laboratory in the the late 1950s. A full-sized vehicle body was mounted to a rollover simulator (Fig. 12) which caused the vehicle to revolve about a fixed axis at a known rate. Motion picture cameras could then photograph the ac- tion of the dummy occupants. FULL-SIZED SLED TESTS Dynamic testing, using a sled on rails, is not new. One ac- count (24) of the history of track testing cites a test of a steam-driven aircraft in 1894. However, the application of sled facilities to the impact injury question did not begin until just after World War II, when the first aeromedicai decelera- tion experiments, under the direction of Col. J. P. Stapp, took place at Edwards Air Force Base in 1947. These experiments were continued (25) on the famous "Sonic Wind" sled at Holloman AFB during the period 1953-1956. The particular application of sled techniques to impact test- ing of automotive vehicles did not emerge until 1955, when General Motors Corp. adapted a test technique being used by Beech Aircraft Co. to evaluate pilot restraint systems. Beech was abruptly stopping a towed aircraft using various arresting means. A heavy-duty hydraulic snubber (Fig. 13) was built by GM (26) that could decelerate a test bed at barrier collision g- levels without destroying a vehicle for each test. Although not mounted on rails as such, this device was a sort of sled in that it had a test dolly, was accelerated to test speed, and was stopped in a controllable manner. The "snubber" was used until 1962, when the first "HYGE" impact sled was installed at the GM Proving Ground (27). This new device, developed Fig. 13 - Hydraulic snubber device Fig. 14 - First HYGE impact sled in cooperation with what was then Consolidated Vacuum Corp., was the first sled that was capable of simulating actual collision acceleration waveforms on complete cars (Fig. 14). This impact equipment differed from the snubber because ini- tially it was at rest and then was accelerated rearward to simu- late the desired impact condition. This action has the advan- tage of allowing easier positioning of dummies and cameras to obtain a given test setup repeatedly. This sled has been used for all kinds of vehicle impact studies that do not involve the actual crush of the vehicle passenger compartment. Many re- finements (28, 29) have been made to provide a safe, reliable, and realistic test system. Various test agencies throughout the United States (and the world) have acquired similar sleds. Many other types of sleds have been and are in use that can handle relatively large payloads usually involving a complete vehicle body or, at least, a full seat or instrument panel buck. They employ various methods for accelerating and decelerat- ing the test specimen which, unfortunately, means that a vari- ety of impact pulse waveforms are being used. This fact tends to make the job of comparing results among the various facili- ties more difficult. Two sled techniques are the subject of other papers (30, 31). A list of additional selected facilities is as fol- lows: (This list is not intended to be an exhaustive survey but, rather, is a group of references that were readily available to demonstrate the variety of sleds that have been built.) 1 .

Holloman Air Force Base (37) - The "Daisy Decelerator" also is accelerated pneumatically but is stopped by an adjust- able water brake. All of these, and the many other sleds in the United States, have been used to study a variety of impact situations that re- late to automotive occupant safety. They offer a quicker, less expensive, more repeatable way to evaluate vehicle impact phenomena. However, they all are limited to those studies that do not involve the actual crush of the vehicle passenger compartment. Full-scale impacts are still necessary to give the complete picture of vehicle performance. LABORATORY COMPONENT TESTS Although full-scale collision tests and full-sized sled tests work hand in hand in the impact test field, they cannot pro- vide all the many detailed answers regarding the impact perfor- mance of every last component in a vehicle. One problem to- day is the sheer quantity of tests to be run. They cannot all be complete, full-scale events. The vehicle impact testing com- munity has, over the years, developed a multitude of smaller, laboratory -type tests that do a very good jòb of evaluating a particular property of a particular component. Tracing the history of component impact tests is a difficult task because of the vast variety of studies that have been made. A rather complete bibliography (38) on the general subject of the biological effects of impact and acceleration makes first reference to automotive component impact tests in the mid-1950s. The Motor Vehicle Research Center carried out a series of experiments (10) in 1955 to evaluate the rela- tive injury potential of different design steering wheels. A pen- dulum device (Fig. 15) was used that propelled a wooden-slat simulation of the human chest into the steering wheel. In 1955, the Ford Motor Co. initiated the development of a torso-shaped body block which was used for the impact test- ing of steering wheels. This pendulum-swung body block (39), shown in Fig. 16, was fabricated with a cold-setting rub- ber material known as "Blak Tufy." Further refinement of this body block resulted in its eventual use in SAE J944a (40). During 1956, Chrysler Corp. developed an impact pendulum for testing the safety characteristics of padded instrument pan- els (41). This led to the pendulum used in SAE J921a (42). Another early laboratory component test (43) concerned the dynamic strength of seat belts. This equipment used grav- ity to accelerate a loading fixture, an oil buffer to decelerate the fixture, and a 150 lb body block to load the seat belt in- ertially. Tests of this general type are still conducted today. It would be impossible to form an all-inclusive list of every vehicle component impact or static strength test that is con- ducted today. Techniques are changing continually to provide improved realism and repeatability. Perhaps a listing of those tests that are the subjects of current SAE Recommended Prac- tices (44) will begin to indicate the extent and variety of such testing: 1 .

Simplified Methods for Simulating Glancing Blow Im- pacts - SAE J 136. Many of these procedures are referenced by the current U. S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The resulting volume of testing and need for accuracy have generated much development of the equipment and techniques used to per- form component impact tests. IMPACT MODELS Up to this point, only those techniques of physically testing an actual piece of hardware have been discussed. However, an- other category of impact "tests" cannot be overlooked. This category covers those studies dealing with modeling of vehicle impact performance. In many cases, scale models can be built ■ or equations can be written that describe the behavior of ve- hicles and occupants under crash conditions. If sufficiently valid, these models can save many test hours and test dollars during the development of vehicle impact safety features. One of the earliest model studies related directly to vehicle impact work was conducted at the Cornell Aeronautical Lab- oratories (45). This model (Fig. 17) was a two-dimensional mechanical representation of a vehicle occupant, aptly dubbed the "thin man." A shock-cord accelerated sled carried an outline of the vehicle interior along with its "thin man" occupant. Simple pencil tracing techniques recorded the tra- jectory of the manikin during the deceleration phase of the test. More recent scale-model work (46, 47) has involved the total vehicle. Miniature structures, 1/10 or 1/16 size, were con-</page><page sequence="9">VEHICLE IMPACT TESTING 1461 Fig. 15 - Early steering wheel impact torso structed to have the correctly scaled mass and crush properties of their full-scale counterparts. Scaled-down collisions then were conducted and evaluated. The results generally seemed to agree with known responses of full-scale vehicles and occu- pants. The development of electronic computers has made practical the more elegant mathematical simulations of vehicle impact phenomena. An overview (48) of this aspect of modeling was given as an introduction to the Automotive Safety Dynamic Modeling Symposium that was held in conjunction with the 1 1th Stapp Car Crash Conference in Anaheim, California, in 1967. In it, the author stated: "Vehicle crash analysis is a particularly appropriate field for the application of mathematical modeling because of the many variables, the wide variety of impact conditions, and the high cost of testing. . . . The mathematical modeling technique is one of the types of problems made solvable only by the computer." Among the first computer simulations of occupant impact dynamics was the work of McHenry and others at the Cornell Aeronautical Labs (49). This mathematical modeling was a natural outgrowth of the "thin man" mechanical model dis- cussed previously. A two-dimensional, seven-degree-of-free- dom model represented the human body and typical restraint systems. The time-history of the vehicle deceleration was re- quired as input, while the forces, acceleration, velocities, and displacements of the various points in the system were pro- vided as outputs. Several updating revisions have been made by Cornell (50, 5 1) and the Highway Safety Research Institute at the University of Michigan (52), while additional occupant kinematic models (53-55) have been forthcoming. The role of the vehicle structure dynamics also has been the subject of mathematical modeling. Although a sampling (56- 58) of the published work in this field seems to indicate a focusing on the frontal collision, other areas of the vehicle could be studied by the same general methods.</page><page sequence="10">1462 R. A. WILSON Fig. 16 - Later steering wheel impact body block Fig. 17 - "Thin man" two-dimensional model OCCUPANT SIMULATORS (DUMMIES) The preceding categories of this paper have dealt with only half the story- producing the impact. The other half is evaluating the results so that a better understanding of the vehicle and occupant impact situation might be achieved. Leading off this area is the category labeled "occupant simulators," more commonly known as "dummies." These most important tools in vehicle impact testing have progressed from having been only crude forms of "ballast" in the early 1950s, to being articulated instrument "carriers" during the 1960s, and toward becoming sophisticated instruments, themselves, in the 1970s. In 1965, Derwyn Severy prepared a comprehensive paper (59) titled "Human Simulations for Automotive Research," which contains an excellent review of dummy development to that date. Several edited quotes and references from that paper might best set the stage for this review of later work. (The reference numbers have been changed to correspond to the bibliography of this paper.) "Some Early Applications - A review of the 'Chronological Index on Impact Acceleration Stress' (38) indicates a long-time interest in human simulation as evidenced by publications ex- tending back as far as 1876. These impact studies and observa- tions, however, refer to animals and man (voluntary and accidental) and the concept of simulating man mechanically did not become popular until the early 1950s. "Prior to the 1940s occasional sandbagging for parachute drop tests, the prizefighter's punching bag, and a few other rather crude forms of human simulation were representative of the principal requirements and efforts. These studies were carried out by engineers, physicists, medical researchers, and scientists who turned to the various forms of human simula- tion for advancing their man-machine-environmental studies. "Under contract to the U. S. Air Force, in 1949, Ritterrath and Kindred of Sierra Engineering Co. conducted an initial study for the development of the first manufactured anthro- pometric dummy. Several staff members of the University of California acted as consultants to this developmental pro- gram. "Following a literature search, a set of specifications, based on anthropometric data, was developed for a 200-lb human model. A torso cast of plaster of paris was made to the anthropometric specifications. Additional studies determined appropriate construction for the spine, shoulder and pel- vic girdles, the rib cage, limbs, and head. Limitations of mo- tion for the principal joints as well as representative joint-to- joint dimensions were provided by other U. S. Air Force Studies. Gaps in data were supplied by direct measurement of human subjects. Subsequently, these data were refined as in- vestigators completed more extensive studies. "In 1950, at least three organizations, operating indepen- dently, began building anthropometric dummies. They were: "Swearingen (60) of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, dissatisfied with the rigid weight dummies used for parachute testing, developed specifications and built al20-lb dummy with articulated joints. Distribution of body weight and centers of gravity were similar to the human body. "Ritterrath (61) of Sierra Engineering Co., under contract with the USAF, conducted a study leading to specifications and subsequent manufacture of anthropometric dummies. "Mathewson and Severy (8) purchased an articulated, full- size store manikin, strengthened the joints and weighted the body components to simulate human weight distribution. This dummy was partially dismembered in the first UCLA automobile crash in 1951 and had to be improved as it was rebuilt. "By 1954, a second manufacturer of anthropometric dum- mies had its initial models available for sale. The Alderson Research Laboratories, Inc., developed their Mark I dum-</page><page sequence="11">VEHICLE IMPACT TESTING 1 463 my in 1952 at a time when little was known about manu- facturing techniques for anthropometric dummies." Severy's paper went on to describe in more detail the various dummies that were available at the time of his writing (1956). Prophetically, he made the following statement early in the paper: "Because anthropometric dummy manufacturing is neces- sarily a service of providing customized human simulations for highly specialized research requirements, the direction and rate of progress of this science necessarily depends on the nature of the human factors research being conducted not only in the United States but throughout the world. Higher fidelity human simulations will be manufactured as rapidly as there occur research demands requiring such units and adequate funding to provide for their develop- ment and manufacture." For, in recent years, dummy improvements have come about. The Alderson Research Laboratories discussed their develop- ments (62) at the Eleventh Stapp Conference in 1967. Im- provements in pelvis, ribcage, shoulder, and spinal column simulations were noted. A highly realistic dummy, "Sophis- ticated Sam," was discussed (63, 64) in early and mid- 1968. This new dummy (Fig. 18), developed by Sierra En- gineering Co. under contract with General Motors, represents the latest refinements in human simulations and is the fore- runner of future improvements such as those discussed in Ref. 65. Another recent development in dummy technology is the establishment of a standard anthropometric test device for use in vehicle impact test work. An SAE task group undertook the job of correlating the known information about dummies and writing an SAE Recommended Practice (66) that could guide the various manufacturers and users of crash dummies toward an easier comparison of test results. A comprehensive review of the task group's efforts can be found in an SAE paper (67). There is an additional test technique related to the "occu- pant" that has been and is being used to evaluate impact situations. Human volunteers have subjected themselves to various conditions in order to gain human tolerance data and to evaluate impact attenuation devices. The bibliography of Ref. 38 contains many entries that document this subject. ELECTRONIC AND PHOTOGRAPHIC INSTRUMENTATION As the questions to be answered from vehicle impact testing become more complex, the data-gathering techniques used will also need to be more advanced. Instrumentation used for impact work usually falls into two categories: electronic and photographic. As stated before, they are used to complement each other in a great number of instances. The early vehicle impact researchers (68, 69, 10) did employ electronic and photographic measurement techniques to gather data. In fact, many of their basic types of measure- ments are still made today, although the equipment is more sophisticated. A paper (70) from General Motors documents Fig. 18 - "Sophisticated Sam" the techniques being used today. One of the opening para- graphs from that paper seems to summarize where the art is now: "We have seen a period of evolutionary change in the in- strumentation field for collecting impact test data- changes that have occurred to help satisfy some of the requirements I have discussed. New transducers that relate forces and ac- celerations to electrical signals are constantly being devel- oped. These new transducers are more reliable, more ac- curate, and have less effect on the test itself than those previously used. The use of magnetic tape recording and the digital computer for data processing have helped to speed up the data handling process and shorten turnaround time. New calibration techniques have reduced pre-test setup time. New s peci al -pur pose analog computer elements are now in use that process data while the test is in progress, so that computer answers are available immediately following the test. High speed film coverage has been improved with bet- ter lighting and more reliable equipment. The use of sequencing still cameras provides pictures of the action to the engineers prior to seeing high speed movies." The remainder of the paper details varied methods used to measure and record (Fig. 19) the events from impact tests. OTHER INSTRUMENTATION There are several other impact-measurement techniques, more mechanical in nature, that should be mentioned. One of these is the impact pressure indicating means developed by GM Research Laboratories and known as "Met-Net" (71). A metallic, crushable-foam material is placed on an impacting dummy bodyform. After the test, the depth of crush of the metal foam can be correlated to the localized loading pattern that was present during the impact. This technique shows promise, although at present, the data reduction time for each</page><page sequence="12">1464 R.A.WILSON Fig. 19 - Current data recording system test is quite lengthy, and the material itself is not available commercially. Another type of mechanical measurement includes those methods that provide a direct indication of the human trauma that might be produced by a given impact. Among the more recent developments are trauma-indicating internal organs (65) and several skullforms (72, 73). DATA ANALYSIS The last category in the vehicle impact test outline includes those methods used for reducing and presenting the vast amounts of data that are being generated today. Analysis of early collision testing was done largely by eye or by hand. Motion picture film and oscillograph records were made dur- ing the test and developed later. Unfortunately, these "hard- copy" records did not lend themselves to further automatic processing by machines. The advent of computers and mag- netic tape recorders has made automatic data reduction pos- sible. A paper (74) which reviews current data reduction techniques can be found in the Proceedings of the GM Auto- motive Safety Seminar held in 1968. High-speed photography has proved to be an invaluable tool for recording and measuring impact events. Recent improve- ments have been made to film analysis machines so that these measurements can be taken semiautomatically and can be scaled and plotted by computer routines. A 1970 paper (75) documents an approach to film analysis used by Chrysler Corp. that relaxes camera placement requirements by making use of computers to handle the parallax and calibration problems. OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE This paper has attempted to put the complex subject of ve- hicle impact testing into some sort of manageable perspective. It has looked at the history to see how it all was started. An outline of topics was presented to help categorize the many facets of the technology now being used to study vehicle colli- sions and their resulting occupant dynamics. But what of the future? Surely, today's questions need better answers and to- morrow's questions need new answers. Present methods of producing the impact and evaluating the results will need con- tinuing development to provide these future answers faster and with less cost. Some of the future needs in this area will include: 1 . Developing even more sled and laboratory simulations that can be used to sort out more quickly some of the items now being evaluated by full-scale collisions. 2. Inventing completely automatic methods of film analy- sis to speed up the turnaround time between test, evaluation, and further test. 3. Finding ways to make computer models takes even more of the cut-and-try process out of impact testing. 4. Determining those factors in full-scale collision testing that cause the relative nonrepeatability of such tests. 5. Making further efforts to relate test conditions to field accident conditions. 6. Refining test equipment, instrumentation, and photo- graphic equipment to minimize their effect on the test itself, itself. However, in attempting to provide these new answers, those engaged in vehicle impact testing face additional major prob- lems that appear to be in the area of human biomechanical in- formation. Estimates of the threshold for human injury have been available and used in conjunction with vehicle impact tests for some period of time. Tolerance values for concussive injury, knee -thigh-hip injuries, upper torso skeletal damage, and others have been reported and are summarized in an SAE Information Report, J885a (76). Unfortunately, today's data are not enough to answer to- morrow's questions. Knowing how to produce the impact is farther along than knowing what body form to impact against or impact with. How to obtain and record the data is less of a problem than how to interpret the results for injury potential.</page><page sequence="13">VEHICLE IMPACT TESTING 1465 For example, lateral impacts to vehicles can cause injuries and fatalities in field accidents. There would be little difficulty in devising a velocity -generating machine that would impact the vehicle door interior with some sort of bodyform. But how shall we construct this bodyform? What are the strengths and compliances of the human body that need to be duplicated? Also, we can take many sophisticated measurements of forces and accelerations during this new lateral test. But what measure- ments are most indicative of injury? What time or acceleration level weighting factors should be applied during the data re- duction process to produce a meaningful index of injury potential? Another example might be the chest impact situation. Field accident data seem to show that some fatalities are occurring from internal organ motion itself. How can we measure this during a vehicle impact test? What data are available to con- struct dummies that will reproduce this action. Even if it were reproduced, what measurement should be made to evaluate the injury problem? These and other areas of the vehicle impact testing field will need much more biomechanical data upon which to base new test techniques and new analysis methods. The vehicle impact testing community will have to work closely with the bio- mechanics community to work out tomorrow's answers to to- day's unsolved problems. REFERENCES 1 .
