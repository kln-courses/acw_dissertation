ABSTRACT Crash test dummies rely on biomechanical data from cadaver studies to biofidelically reproduce loading and predict injury. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain equivalent measurements of leg loading in a dummy and a cadaver, particularly for bending moments. A methodology is presented here to implant load cells in the tibia and fibula while minimally altering the functional anatomy of the two bones. The location and orientation of the load cells can be measured in all six degrees of freedom from post-test radiographs. Equations are given to transform tibial and fibular load cell measurements from a cadaver or dummy to a common leg coordinate frame so that test data can be meaningfully compared. INTRODUCTION In a human, loading of the leg is borne by two long bones: the tibia and the fibula. The tibia is the larger of the two bones and bears most of the load. The fibula has been reported to bear approximately 10% of the total axial compressive load when the ankle is neutrally oriented (Crandall et al., 1996), although the proportion may be much higher when the foot is everted (Crandall et al., 1996; Jaffredo et al., 2000). Axial loading is transmitted through the leg between the centers of rotation at the ankle and knee joints. Shear forces and moments can be transmitted to the leg through the joints by ligamentous and bony resistance. Forces can also be transmitted directly to the tibia and fibula either by external contact or by tension in internal tissues. The tibia is relatively straight except for the tibial plateau, which flares posteriorly and laterally. As a result, the tibia bows anteriorly and medially with respect to the line between the knee and ankle centers. The fibula is situated posteriorly and laterally to the tibia but bows posteriorly and medially. Because of this geometry, axial loading of the leg induces antero-medial bending of the tibia (Lambert, 1971; Thomas et al., 1995) and postero-medial bending of the fibula (Lambert, 1971; Segal et al., 1981; Škraba and Greenwald, 1984). Several methods have been developed to measure internal leg loads and moments in a cadaver. By far the most common approach has been to section the limb midshaft and pot the tibia and fibula together in a bone cup bolted to a load cell (Markholf et al., 1989; Stiehl et al., 1992; Begeman et al., 1992; Begeman et al., 1993; Begeman et al., 1994; Begeman and Aekbote, 1996; Petit et al., 1996; Michelson et al., 1997; Kitaoka et al., 1997; Parenteau et al., 1998; Kitagawa et al., 1998). This approach has the advantage of being simple, but it has important limitations, as well. One disadvantage of potting the tibia and fibula together is that the relative motion between the two bones is constrained. In an intact leg, the fibula articulates with the tibia at both its proximal and distal ends, and therefore moves with respect to the tibia in response to both axial loading and ankle rotation. Under axial loading, the lateral malleolus has been shown to migrate distally and laterally with respect to the tibia (Scranton et al., 1976; Weinert et al., 1973; Wang et al., 1996). The fibula also moves with respect to the tibia in dorsiflexion, inversion and eversión. Potting the tibia and fibula together has been shown experimentally to stiffen the ankle joint's resistance to these motions (Schreiber et al., 1995). Another limitation of potting the tibia and fibula together is that measured leg loads are combined and cannot be decomposed into tibial and fibular loading components. In addition, because the knee has been removed, it is impossible to define a coordinate system with respect to the knee and ankle centers. It is necessary to establish such a coordinate system in order to compute tibial loads and moments that are equivalent to measurements taken in a dummy. Other studies have employed methodologies that reduce or eliminate some of the above limitations. Several investigators have potted the tibial plateau, which has the advantage of leaving the majority of the leg intact (Begeman and Prasad, 1990; Yoganandan et al., 1996; McMaster et al., 2000). The disadvantages of this approach are that the loads are measured proximally, rather than midshaft, and that measured leg loads are combined, and therefore cannot be decomposed into tibial and fibular loading components. Other researchers 960</page><page sequence="2">have implanted a load cell in the midshaft of the tibia, with the fibula either left intact (Klopp et al., 1997; Manning et al., 1997; Funk et al., 2001), cut and free (Siegler et al., 1988), constrained in one direction (Cawley and France, 1991), or cut and fixed to the tibia with a screw (Portier et al., 1997). There are also potential disadvantages to implanting a load cell midshaft. First, implanting a load cell midshaft requires that the interosseus membrane connecting the tibia and fibula be cut. Some researchers have reported that the interosseus membrane is an important structure in transmitting loads to the fibula (Škraba and Greenwald, 1984). However, other researchers have found that sectioning the interosseus membrane causes no significant changes in fibular loading (Lambert, 1971; Takebe et al., 1984; Wang et al., 1996). Another potential disadvantage to the midshaft load cell approach is that the proximal and distal bone ends may lose their original length, rotation, and alignment during load cell implantation. Some research groups have addressed this problem by developing mounting jigs to maintain tibial alignment in all six degrees of freedom during load cell implantation (Manning et al., 1997; Funk et al., 2000). An additional disadvantage of the implanted tibial load cell methodology is that fibular loads are not measured. This problem can be solved by implanting an additional load cell in the fibula (Takebe et al., 1983; Jaffredo et al., 2000). Implanting separate load cells has the advantage of allowing natural motion between the two bones. An additional difficulty in any cadaveric measurement scheme is transforming the measured data from the local load cell coordinate frame to a more general leg coordinate frame, so that tibial loads and moments measured in cadaver tests can be meaningfully compared to measurements made by anthropomorphic test dummies. Anthropomorphic test dummies measure the loading response of the leg using load cells situated in the proximal and distal tibia. Both the Hybrid III dummy leg and the Thor-LX have simplified geometries that differ from each other as well as from the anatomy of a human leg. The knee and ankle centers of both dummies are located at approximately the same position as in a human. The Hybrid III leg consists of a zigzagged rigid member between the knee and ankle centers. In the Hybrid III leg, both tibial load cells are tilted forward slightly with respect to line between the knee and ankle centers, with the proximal load cell center anterior to this line and the distal tibial load cell posterior to this line. The Thor-LX consists of a straight member between these points with a rubber puck in the midshaft for axial compliance. Neither dummy leg has a structure to simulate the fibula in a human. In a cadaver, an implanted load cell will not be orthogonal to the leg coordinate frame as defined by the knee and ankle center, nor will the center of the load cell coincide with the line between the knee and ankle centers. The error introduced by this misalignment is probably negligible for certain measurements, such as axial load. However, tibia curvature in a cadaver can induce significant midshaft bending moments when high axial loads are present. These induced bending moments will in turn significantly affect the Tibia Index, which is commonly used as an injury criterion. In addition, it may be desirable to transform the bending moments from the load cell center to another remote location, such as the ankle center. In order to do this, it is necessary to precisely measure the location and orientation of the implanted load cell in all six degrees of freedom. METHODS Human lower limb specimens were obtained from medical cadavers in accordance with ethical guidelines and research protocol approved by the Human Usage Review Panel, National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, and a University of Virginia institutional review board. Prior to testing, all specimens were screened for HIV and hepatitis, and x-rays were checked for signs of pre-existing bone and joint pathology. TIBIAL LOAD CELL IMPLANTATION - Forty-three (43) specimens were tested in an axial impact study, the results of which are reported elsewhere (Funk et al., 2001 ). All specimens were sectioned above the knee at mid-femur to preserve the functional anatomy of the knee joint and leg musculature. Specimens were instrumented with an implanted five-axis tibial load cell using the following procedure. First, a 20 cm incision was made along the skin overlaying the mid-diaphyseal portion of the anterior tibial ridge. Next, two 8 cm transverse incisions were made at the proximal and distal ends of the first incision to create skin flaps. The fascia was then cut away from the bone surface to expose the tibia (Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Exposed tibia in preparation for load cell implantation. A mounting jig, consisting of a 15 cm (6") long half-piece of tubing on the anterior side and two 2.5 cm (T') long half-pieces of tubing on the posterior side, was then placed around the tibia. The posterior pieces were slid beneath the tibia and connected to the anterior piece. The mounting jig was secured to the tibia with six jack screws, three on the proximal end and three on the distal end. At both ends, the bone was centered within the 32 mm (VA") diameter mounting jig (Figure 2). 961</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Tibia with mounting jig in place. Four bicortical holes, two proximal and two distal, were then drilled through the tibia using drill guides attached to the mounting jig. After drilling, the mounting jig was removed. A 9 cm portion of the tibial diaphysis between the drilled holes was then removed using an orthopaedic bone saw (Figure 3). Figure 3. Tibia with locating holes and section removed. The bone ends were then potted in specially made bone cups. The bone cups were bolted to load cell cradles, which in turn were connected to each other via a dummy load cell blank. The cup, cradle, and blank assembly was the same length and diameter as the mounting jig. Holes in the bone cups corresponded to the location of the drill guide holes on the mounting jig. Four 3 mm (1/8") diameter locating pins were passed through the holes in the bone cups and the tibia to ensure that the original length, rotation and alignment of the bone ends were preserved (Figure 4). Figure 4. Bone cup, cradle, and blank assembly installed in tibia using locating pins. A polyester resin was inserted into the bone cups with syringes around the bone ends in order to strengthen the interface. During this entire procedure, the fibula was left intact. The epoxy was allowed at least 12 hours to harden. Immediately before testing, the dummy load cell blank was removed and a custom-made five-axis tibial load cell (Robert A. Denton, Inc.) was installed in its place (Figure 5). After testing, the load cell was removed and a blank was reinstalled in its place. Figure 5. Tibia with implanted load cell in place. FIBULAR LOAD CELL IMPLANTATION - In a separate study of ankle inversion and eversión, the results of which have not yet been published, twenty-seven (27) specimens were instrumented with both a tibial and a fibular load cell. After installation of the tibial load cell, a simplified mounting procedure was used to install the fibular load cell that did not utilize a mounting jig. First, a 15 cm long incision was made on the lateral side of the leg, and an approximately 15 cm long portion of the fibular diaphysis was exposed and cleaned of soft tissue. A 7 cm portion of the fibular diaphysis was then removed (Figure 6). Figure 6. Fibula with section removed and load cell cups and blank. Fibular load cell shown in inset. The bone ends were then potted in 19 mm (%") diameter bone cups using a polyester resin. The bone cups were connected via a dummy load cell blank. After the resin had hardened and immediately before testing, the dummy load cell blank was removed and a custom- made six-axis fibular load cell (Robert A. Denton, Inc.) was installed in its place (Figure 7). The fibular load cell was shaped like a cylinder with a segment removed to avoid interference with the tibial load cell. After testing, the load cells were removed and blanks were reinstalled in their place. 962</page><page sequence="4">Figure 7. Leg specimen shown with tibial and fibular load cells installed. LOAD CELL ORIENTATION - The location and rotation of the tibial and fibular load cells were determined with respect to the three-dimensional leg coordinate frame using the SAE sign convention (Figure 8). The coordinate system originated at the ankle center, with the X-axis pointing anteriorly through the second metatarsal, the Y-axis pointing to the right, and the Z- axis pointing interiorly along the line defined by the knee center and ankle center. This orientation of the load cells with respect to this coordinate system was determined for each specimen based on post-test radiographs. Figure 8. SAE sign convention for the lower limb. Post-test radiographs included anterior-posterior (A-P) and lateral views of the entire leg between the knee and ankle. These x-rays were digitally scanned and analyzed using standard image processing software. An orthopaedic surgeon located the knee center and ankle center using anatomical landmarks. The knee center was defined as the center of the intercondylar eminence (also called the tibial spine), and the ankle center was defined by the subtalar joint center (Parenteau et al., 1998). The location and orientation of the load cells were determined by picking the four outermost corners of the bone cups. The known dimensions of the cup, cradle, and blank assembly were used to scale the measured distances on the x-ray image. The coordinates of these six points were entered into a spreadsheet that performed all of the necessary calculations. The A-P view was used to determine the X-axis rotation of the load cell and the Y-axis and Z-axis position of the load cell center with respect to the tibial coordinate frame. The lateral view was used to determine the Y-axis rotation of the load cell and the X- axis and Z-axis position of the load cell center (Figure 9). The Z-axis position of the load cell center was taken as the average calculated from both views. The Z-axis rotation of the load cell was measured with a protractor before each test with the ankle in the neutral position. All angles were measured from the leg coordinate frame as defined above to the local load cell frame. A positive X-axis rotation of the load cell corresponded to a medial tilt of the proximal end of the load cell in a left leg or a lateral tilt of the proximal end of the load cell in a right leg. A positive Y-axis rotation of the load cell corresponded to a posterior tilt of the proximal end of the load cell, and a positive Z-axis rotation corresponded to a medial rotation of the load cell for a left leg or a lateral rotation for a right leg. X-axis and Y-axis rotations were measured with respect to the Z-axis, and Z-axis rotations were measured with respect to the X-axis. The three measured rotations of the load cell with respect to the tibial coordinate frame were treated as a Z-Y-X sequence of Euler angles. However, because X-axis and Y-axis rotations were typically very small, the Euler angles can be regarded as sequence-independent. Forces measured by the load cell were transformed to the tibial coordinate frame using the following matrix: F,1 'cz-cy -sz-cx+cz-sy-sx sz ■ sx + cz ■ sy- ex If F, Fy = sz-cy cz-cx + sz-sy-sx -cz-sx+sz-sy-cx Fylc v ' Fz -sy cy-sx cy-cx Fdc where Fx, Fy, and Fz denote forces transformed to the tibial frame, c denotes cosine, s denotes sine, x, y, and z denote 0X, 0y, and 0Z, respectively, and FX|C, Fyic, and FZ|C denote forces measured by the load cell. Moments measured by the tibial load cell were transformed to the tibia frame using a simpler transformation matrix. The five-axis load cell implanted in the tibia was not capable of measuring Mz. Therefore, the rotation of the load cell about the X-axis and Y-axis was neglected, and equation (1) was simplified to consider only the Z-axis rotation: Ml x [cos# z - sin &lt;9 z T M , x z z (r)' My sin#, cos#, _ Mylc where Mx and My denote moments transformed to the tibial frame and Mxte and Myic moments measured by the tibial load cell. For the six-axis fibular load cell, moments in the tibial frame were calculated using the same transformation matrix as given in equation (1), substituting moments for forces. 963</page><page sequence="5">Figure 9. Lateral post-test x-ray showing user-defined points used to determine load cell location and orientation. Distances measured from the x-rays were used to place the location of the load cell center in the tibial coordinate frame. A positive X-axis coordinate indicates that the load cell center was anterior to the line connecting the knee and ankle centers. A positive Y-axis coordinate indicates that the load cell center was medial to the line connecting the knee and ankle centers in a left leg, or lateral to this line in a right leg. All load cells were implanted superior to the subtalar joint center, giving them a negative Z-axis coordinate in the tibial frame. The X-axis and Y-axis coordinates of the load cell were used to transform the measured tibial moments from the load cell center to the line connecting the knee and ankle centers: Mxmid=Mx+Fz-ylc (3) Mymid=My-FFXlc (4) where Mx mid and My mid denote midshaft tibial moments at a point along the line connecting the ankle and knee centers, Mx and My denote load cell moments transformed to the tibial frame using equation (2), Fz denotes axial force, and yļc and xte denote the coordinates of the load cell center in the tibial frame. Note that the midshaft tibial moments calculated above are at the same Z-axis level as the load cell center, but the effects of the X-axis and Y-axis offsets have been removed. The above calculation includes only static terms because it transfers the ankle moment only a short distance, and the inertia of the segment between the load cell center and the corresponding point along the line between the knee and ankle centers is assumed negligible. However, for moment transformations over a larger distance, such as from the midshaft load cells to the ankle center, it is necessary to apply equations of dynamic equilibrium (Jaffredo et al., 2000) (Figure 10): X ank X tlc F y tic Z tic F z île T tic + Mxflc-Fyflc'Zflc+Fzflc'yflc (5) My ank - M y tlc + Fx tlc - ztlc Fz tlc - xtlc My flc Fx flc ' Z fle Fz ßc ' Xßc (6) + m¡eg'ax-zcg-az-xcg)+Iy-ay where Mx ank and My ank denote moments experienced by the ankle center, Ft|C and Mtic denote forces and moments measured by the tibial load cell that have been transformed to the tibial frame using equation (1) and (2), Ffic and Mflc denote forces and moments measured by the fibular load cell that have been transformed to the tibial frame using equation (1), mteg and I denote the mass and moment of inertia of the segment between the tibial load cell center and the ankle center, a and a denote the linear and angular accelerations of the segment, and x, y, and z denote the coordinates of the tibial load cell center, fibular load center, or segment center of gravity in the tibial frame.

It was not possible to determine the location of the knee and ankle centers in the remaining specimens due to tibial fractures sustained during testing. This specimen pool consisted of 14 males and 10 females having a mean age of 61, a mean height of 172 cm, and a mean weight of 67 kg. Table 1.

This specimen pool consisted of 11 males and 10 females having a mean age of 62, a mean height of 171 cm, and a mean weight of 78 kg. The specimen pools in both studies approximate the overall population in terms of size and gender distribution. The mean distance from the ankle center to the knee center was 405 mm in the cadavers, which is slightly less than for the 50th percentile male Hybrid III leg (416 mm) or Thor-LX (419 mm). There are important differences in the average orientation of the tibial and fibular load cells implanted in the cadavers as compared to the orientations and locations of the tibial load cells in the dummy limbs. All of the load cells are aligned nearly vertically with respect to the X-axis. The cadaver tibial load cells were generally tilted slightly (-4°) about the Y-axis in the anterior direction. The tibial load cells in the Hybrid III leg show a more exaggerated tilt in this direction (-8.3°), whereas the tibial load cells in the Thor-LX are aligned with the vertical. Due to systematic human error during load cell implantation, the tibial load cells tended to point medially and the fibular load cells tended to point laterally about the Z-axis. Likewise, the locations of the load cells differed between the cadaver and dummy legs. The most important difference is that dummy legs include distal and proximal load cells located at approximately 20% and 75% of the length between the ankle and knee centers, whereas the cadavers were implanted with midshaft tibial and fibular load cells located approximately midway between the ankle and knee centers. The tibial load cell in the cadavers tended to be 12±4 mm anterior and 4±4 mm medial of the line between the knee and ankle centers. The fibula load cell was found to be centered 25±9 mm posterior and 27±5 mm lateral to this line. The Hybrid III leg approximates the curvature of the tibia by placing the distal load cell 6.3 mm posterior and the proximal load cell 28 mm anterior to the line between the knee and ankle centers. Neither load cell deviates medially or laterally in the Hybrid III leg. The tibial load cells in the Thor-LX are orthogonal to and collinear with the line connecting the knee and ankle centers. In the inversion/eversion tests in which a fibular load cell was implanted, fibular loading was found to be important. The moment experienced by the ankle joint was calculated using equation (5). It was found that about one fifth of the ankle moment was resisted by the fibula in forced eversión (Figure 1 1 ). The fibular loading terms in equation (5) were necessary to achieve dynamic equilibrium. Figure 11. Illustration of the how the fibular terns from equation (5) contribute to the total ankle joint moment during forced eversión. DISCUSSION This study describes a multifaceted methodology to aid in the calculation of tibial and fibular loads and moments in biomechanical cadaver studies. It should be noted that the degree of complexity described here is not necessary for all experiments. Attention must be paid to how the limitations of a particular methodology influence the desired parameters being measured. For example, if axial load is the only parameter of interest, it is probably not necessary to account for misalignment of the load cells. However, in tests where bending moments are of interest, it is necessary to account for the location and rotation of the load cells. This is particularly true when high axial loads are present. 965</page><page sequence="7">An important application of the methodology described here is the comparison of tibial loads and moments between cadaver and dummy tests. Because the Hybrid III, Thor-LX, and cadaver tibial load cells all have different offset distances from the line connecting the ankle and knee centers, the same loading will result in different induced bending moments in each limb. Consider a theoretical case in which a purely axial 8 kN compressive force is statically applied to the Hybrid III leg, the Thor-LX, and an instrumented cadaver leg (Figure 12). A static case is considered to show the effect of tibial geometry on induced bending moments when the same axial load is applied to each leg. For the purpose of this thought experiment, it is assumed that the load cells are properly aligned with the tibial load cell coordinate frame, but the load cell centers are located at the coordinates given in Table 1. In practice, load cell misalignment should be corrected using equations (1) and (2). Figure 12. Sagittal plane view of the Hybrid III leg, Thor- LX, and instrumented cadaver leg subjected to 8 kN static axial compression. Induced Y-axis bending moments are shown for the Hybrid III and cadaver tibias. In the cadaver, the fibula is assumed to bear 10% of the load when the ankle is neutrally oriented (Crandall et al., 1996). Therefore, 8 kN of axial load applied to the leg would result in 7.2 kN of axial load being borne by the tibia in this position (Table 2). For the Hybrid III and cadaver legs, the offset locations of the load cell centers in the transverse plane would cause the load cells to report bending moments. These bending moments are not externally applied, but instead are induced by axial loading (Figure 12). The proximal tibial load cell in the Hybrid III leg is offset 28 mm anterior to the line connecting the knee and ankle centers, which would cause 8 kN of axial load to induce a large negative Y- axis bending moment (-224 Nm) at that location. The distal tibial load cell in the Hybrid III leg has an offset distance of 6.3 mm in the opposite direction (posterior), meaning that the distal load cell would report a positive Y-axis bending moment of 50 Nm. The implanted tibial load cell in the cadaver leg would be located approximately 12 mm anterior and 4 mm medial to the line connecting the knee and ankle centers (Table 1). Therefore, 8 kN of axial load to the leg would cause the tibial cell to report a negative Y-axis bending moment of -86 Nm (-7.2 kN * 12 mm). In addition, a smaller X-axis bending moment would be induced, amounting to 29 Nm for a left leg, or -29 Nm for a right leg. The Thor-LX tibial load cells would report no bending moments because they are aligned and collinear with the ankle and knee centers. Table 2. Theoretical raw tibial load cell measurements from a static axial load of 8 kN applied to each left leg. *Measurements cannot be directly compared between a dummy and a cadaver, because the tibial load cell encompasses the entire leg in a dummy, but only the tibia in a cadaver. Load cell Axial Tibia Mx Tibia My location Load (N) (Nm) (Nm) Hybrid III dist 8000 0 50 Hybrid III prox 8000 0 -224 Thor-LX 8000 0 0 Cadaver tibia ļ 7200* | 29* | -86* ~ This thought experiment shows that the same purely axial static loading conditions will result in different tibial load cell measurements for the Hybrid III leg, Thor-LX, and instrumented cadaver legs. For this simplified loading condition, the differences are due entirely to the geometry of the legs. There are two important geometric differences between the legs. First, the human leg contains a fibula, which is not physically reproduced in either dummy leg. It is important to note that the "tibial" load cells in the dummies actually encompass the entire load path of the leg. Therefore, tibial load cell measurements cannot be directly compared between a dummy and a cadaver unless the fibular loading component in the cadaver is also considered. Currently, very little data exists documenting fibular load-sharing for conditions other than quasistatic axial compression of a neutrally oriented ankle. Therefore, implantation of a separate fibular load cell may be able to provide useful biomechanical data in studies performed on cadaver lower extremities. The second major geometric difference between the Hybrid III leg, Thor-LX, and cadaver leg is the shape of the tibia. Neither dummy leg exactly reproduces the shape of the human tibia. The 28 mm anterior offset of the proximal load cell in the Hybrid III leg appears far too large, and the 6 mm posterior offset of the distal load cell is in the wrong direction. The straight tibia of the Thor- LX does not reproduce the curvature that does exist in the human tibia. In spite of these different tibial geometries, data from the Hybrid III leg, Thor-LX, and instrumented cadaver leg can be meaningfully compared for static axial loading by transforming midshaft moments to the line connecting the knee and ankle centers. Applying equations (3) and (4) eliminates the 966</page><page sequence="8">component of the midshaft moment that is induced by axial loading, leaving only the externally applied moment. Removing the effect of the offset distances in the Hybrid III and cadaver tibial load cells results in bending moments that are equivalent to those measured by the Thor-LX for the same axial load. Previous investigators have presented equations for removing the induced bending moments caused by axial loading. Welbourne and Shewchenko (1998) and Zuby et al. (2001) suggested correction formulas similar to equation (4) to remove the induced bending moment caused by the offset distance of the proximal tibial load cell in the Hybrid III dummy leg. However, the influence of shear force was neglected by both investigators. Although its effect is probably small, a shear force in the X-axis direction may contribute to the measured axial force due to the Y-axis rotation of the load cell. Strictly speaking, the proper correction formula is given by equations (1) and (4) in this paper. Removing the effect of the load cell offsets in a dummy does not result in tibial moments that are equivalent to what would be experienced by a human. We have found that the center of the implanted midshaft tibial load cells is not collinear with the knee and ankle centers (Table 1). Therefore, pure axial loading will naturally induce some midshaft bending moments in a human tibia. These bending moments will result in anterior and medial tibial bowing as described by previous strain gauge studies (Lambert, 1971; Thomas et al., 1995). At this time, the precise location of the neutral axis of the tibia with respect to the axial load path between the knee and ankle centers has not been established. Based on a picture from Gray's Anatomy (1985), Welbourne and Shewchenko (1998) estimated the load path to be 13 mm posterior to the neutral axis of the tibia. This estimate is in agreement with our finding that the center of the implanted tibial load cells averaged 12 mm anterior to the line connecting the knee and ankle centers (Table 1). However, it is not known whether the location and orientation of the implanted load cells in this study exactly matched the original geometry of the bone diaphysis. In addition, the location of the knee and ankle centers may change as a function of flexion angle and shear loading. For example, posterior shear loading of the tibial plateau by the knee bolster may cause the knee center to move anteriorly. More detailed anatomical studies should be conducted to determine the offset distances between the neutral axis of the tibia and the line between the knee and ankle centers in a human. Equations (3) and (4) can be modified to transform tibial load cell measurements from either a cadaver or a dummy to any new location in the transverse plane: Mx » = Mx+Fz- (yic - ynew ) (7) M y new = My-Fz- (xlc - xnew ) (8) where Mx new and My new denote tibial moments at a new location in the transverse plane given by the coordinates (Xnew. ynew). Mx and My denote load cell moments transformed to the tibial frame using equation (2), Fz denotes axial force, and y!c and xļc denote the coordinates of the load cell center in the tibial frame. Note that the new tibial moments calculated above are at the same Z-axis level as the load cell center, but at a new X-axis and Y-axis offset. These equations could be useful in transforming tibial load cell measurements from the Hybrid III leg and Thor-LX to a new location equivalent to the centroid of the tibia in a human. The above analysis is derived simply from geometric differences between the Hybrid III leg, Thor-LX, and cadaver leg. It should also be noted that dummy biofidelity is required in order for dummy measurements to be meaningfully compared to a human. In the case of purely axial static loading, any differences between the dummy and human are purely geometric and can be addressed using equations (1)-(4) and accounting for fibular loading in the human. In the case of dynamic loading, the Hybrid III leg has been shown to experience a higher peak axial load than a cadaver under similar loading conditions (Kuppa et al., 2001), while the Thor- LX has been shown to mimic the axial loading response of the cadaver tibia under certain loading conditions (Rudd et al., 1999). In addition, the human ankle transfers moments to the tibia when it is rotated away from the neutral position. The Hybrid III ankle transfers no moments through the ankle joint until the joints stops are reached. The Thor-LX has been shown to biofidelically reproduce the quasistatic moment-angle flexibility characteristics of the human ankle (Rudd et al., 1999). An interesting result from this study was that tibial and fibular load cells were often drastically rotated about the Z-axis (up to 45° laterally and 70° medially), in spite of attempts to align them properly during implantation. During the implantation procedure, the leg specimen was usually laid flat on a table or gurney. The foot was not constrained, so it tended to plantarflex and internally rotate. When the foot was returned to a neutral orientation, the tibial and fibular load cells rotated about their long axes. For a five-axis or six-axis load cell, this misalignment can easily be measured and corrected using equations (1) and (2). However, for a three-axis load cell that only measures transverse forces and moments about one axis, the alignment must be perfect, or else information will be lost. This finding emphasizes the need to use load cells with as many axes as possible. Although the methodology described here is more comprehensive than what has been described by previous studies, it still has limitations. Any load cell implantation disrupts the natural anatomy of the leg. Portier et al. (1997) reported that implantatation of a tibial load cell added 0.79 kg to the leg. Therefore, implantation of the load cells may affect the kinetic and kinematic behavior of the leg during impact conditions. 967</page><page sequence="9">A specific limitation of the methodology presented here is that no jig has been developed to prevent misalignment of the fibular bone ends during implantation of the fibular load cell. It would be difficult to develop a mounting jig for the fibula, because the small size of the bone makes it difficult to drill holes in, as is done for the tibia. An offsetting consideration is that the midshaft of the fibula has a more regular and cylindrical geometry than the midshaft of the tibia, which makes a mounting jig less necessary for the fibula. Nonetheless, development of an external fixator or mounting jig to maintain fibular alignment during load cell implantation would be a methodological improvement. CONCLUSION A methodology to accurately measure tibial and fibular loads in biomechanical cadaver studies is described. A method for implanting a tibial load cell while maintaining the original length, rotation, and alignment of the bone has been developed and implemented. A method for implanting a fibular load cell has also been developed. Knowledge of fibular loading is essential for certain loading conditions, such as forced eversión of the foot. The precise orientation and location of the load cells can be measured from radiographs. This allows raw data to be transformed from the local load cell frame to a more universal tibial frame defined by the ankle and knee centers. The effect of the offset distance between the load cell centers and the line connecting the knee and ankle centers can be removed, which allows for a convenient and meaningful comparison of tibial bending moments experienced by a cadaver leg versus the Hybrid III leg or Thor-LX.
