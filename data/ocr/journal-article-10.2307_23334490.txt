In many historical accounts of veterinary medicine, animal patients are backgrounded or completely invisible. Yet modern veterinary medicine, in its dominant form of companion animal practice, has become increasingly patient-centred. The modern animal patient is accorded something near full subject status in many veterinary clinical interactions. Embracing this raises issues of how to handle animals in veterinary history. Animals are the recipients of veterinary medicine, they exert agency in the clinic and field, yet they have remained problematical for the historian and sociologist, who have remained anthropocentric in orientation. This paper explores different constructions of the veterinary surgical patient in the 20th century in an attempt to begin examination of veterinary history as an animal-patient history "from below." In doing so, a trajectory of the development of British 20th-century veterinary medicine is presented which suggests the value of minding animals in historical accounts. Further interdisciplinary studies of veterinary procedures and practices are needed in order to foreground animals more and evaluate their subject status within historical and contemporary veterinary medicine. KEYWORDS - Veterinary, History, Surgery, Animals, Dogs, Medicine, Patients Introduction In 1992, the British medical historian, Roy Porter, speaking at a conference to mark the bicentenary of the Royal Veterinary College, © 2009 Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn</page><page sequence="2">356 ANDREW GARDINER London, commented on "the appalling dearth of significant writings on the history of British veterinary medicine" (Porter 1993). The situation has improved in 16 years. However, it remains a fact that most veterinary history, British or otherwise, has focussed on veterinary public health and the politico-economics of livestock diseases and pandemics. Locating the animals in these types of histories can be difficult. Even when present, they are peripheral to the main argument, which is often more concerned with humans and microbes. The developing field of veterinary history has not yet properly engaged with patient history or debated what this might mean in the varied contexts of animal medicine and surgery.1 In the humanities and social sciences, animals frequently figure as metaphors. The metaphorical beast is seen as a more productive subject for academic enquiry than the living, breathing creature in the room (or field). Animals may indeed be "good to think with," as Claude Lévi Strauss famously said, but they are more than metaphorical or biological tools. How to relate to the animal "in person," granting the individual its subject status and agency, is an interesting challenge for those revisiting anthropomorphism in the light of recent research on animal sentience and emotions (Knight 2005). It is also an important aspect of veterinary history because, during everyday veterinary encounters, it is apparent to any observer that animals do exert agency. They shape the medicine they receive. This applies to all animal patients not just companion animals and its changing nature is an interesting subject of enquiry for health professionals, historians, sociologists, and anthropologists (Rock, Mykhalovskiy &amp; Schlich 2007; Rock &amp; Babinec 2008). Patient-oriented histories of veterinary medicine will help reveal the many connections and exchanges between animal and human medicine. The late 20th-century genomic enlightenment has led to a return to more frequent usage of that late 19th-century term, "one medicine" (Michell 2000; Cardiff, Ward &amp; Barthold 2008; Degeling 2009a). The transfer of knowledge, treatments, and technologies between animal and human medicine is, therefore, of present-day as well as historical interest and encourages us to consider the medical animal as a patient as well as a model (Gardiner 2004). Surgery is a useful topic for exploring 20th-century veterinary history. In surgery, the individual patient body is always the focus of attention so 1 Recent veterinary histories by professional historians include those by Woods (2004) and Jones (2003). Woods presents a disease history of a livestock plague in Britain, foot and mouth disease. Jones, on American veterinary medicine, contains a chapter on companion animals and investigates various aspects of veterinary patients. Swabe (1999) provides a sociological account of the "rise of veterinary medicine" but with little historical input.</page><page sequence="3">PATIENTS IN VETERINARY SURGERY 357 if we want to examine how veterinarians have responded to animals as patients, this subject is a promising one. In this paper, I will use surgical practices surrounding infection to explore how veterinarians responded to their patients. This involves consideration of "patient bodies" of various types: the collective bodies of late 19th-century cattle herds, which finally led to the acceptance of germ theory in medicine; the bodies of animal surgical patients in the first half of the 20th century and the veterinary germ practices which guided their treatment; and one particular body, an individual dog whose late 20th-century patient narrative influenced contemporary British veterinary practice and canine health activism. In doing this, a trajectory of the development of 20th-century veterinary medicine is presented which, whilst not quite constituting a veterinary history "from below" in the manner of recent medical history, does aim to foreground the recipient of treatment, the animal patient. Herds, Germs and Surgical Practices Human operative surgery became safer when patients could be made insensible to pain and when infection could be controlled. Prior to safe general anaesthesia and surgical germ practices, operations were often a rushed and haphazard affair, fraught with problems associated with haemorrhage, shock, and post-operative sepsis. Speed was of the essence as rapid technique minimised some of the dangers. Consequently, surgeons were judged primarily by how fast they worked. Meticulous tissue dissection, attention to haemostasis (control of bleeding), and careful wound reconstruction following the principles laid down by the Baltimore surgeon William Stewart Halsted (1852-1922) could become possible only when the patient was safely immobilised, infection was kept at bay, and the whole operating environment and associated theatre practices brought under absolute control and discipline. Surgical procedures became stage-managed events located in theatres, with a sequence of planned goals designed to accomplish specific therapeutic aims. Surgeons began to take their time, became more ambitious, and their status approached that of physicians. On veterinary surgical operating practices around the late 19th century, Michael Worboys has written: While generally accepting germ theories, veterinarians did not adopt the practices that followed. . . . Veterinarians had little interest in the greatest of all "germ practices" - antiseptic surgery. Despite having to deal with wounds which were produced and had to heal in the most unsanitary conditions, it was reported that</page><page sequence="4">358 ANDREW GARDINER very few animal wounds ever became septic. (Worboys 1991,323-324) Comparisons with human surgery run throughout this paper. They are historically interesting when considering surgery and infection because, as Worboys (2000) points out, medical microbiology began with breakthroughs in the aetiology and control of veterinary diseases. The anthrax bacillus was isolated by Koch in 1876; Pasteur attenuated the fowl cholera bacillus in 1879, marking the beginnings of immunology; and the first pathogenic virus (that of foot and mouth disease of cattle) was identified by Loeffler in 1898. Prior to these discoveries, the European cattle plague pandemic of 1865 acted like a vast experiment to prove contagionism and demote spontaneous generation as a putative disease mechanism. Until cattle plague was finally eradicated by a rigorous policy of "stamping out" by slaughter, medical and veterinary opinion was divided on how spreading disease began and propagated. It was not, however, a straightforward case of everything changing overnight after cattle plague was proved contagious. The event was an important turning point but not, in veterinary medicine at least, a revolution, and the reluctance of veterinarians to follow through and adopt surgical germ practices shows that other forces were at play which influenced how veterinarians thought about their patients and what they did to them. Indeed, cattle plague was probably more "revolutionary" for human than for veterinary medicine. Cattle plague is not a surgical disease but it illustrates an obvious and important theme in the history of veterinary patients. Some animals are treated en masse, as groups, herds and flocks; other animals, such as horses, dogs, and cats, are treated as individuals. In livestock, "treatment" can sometimes consist of mass slaughter. The eradication methods of cattle plague control are still used to deal with diseases which may be clinically mild, such as foot and mouth disease in sheep, but economically or politically important. Such dramatic variations in veterinary treatment are usually divided along species lines, with some animals effectively treated as "infectious agents" themselves, to be wiped out entirely, and others receiving a high degree of individual care and attention. However it is not invariably a farm animal/companion animal divide, either historically or in the present-day. Mass slaughter of dogs regularly occurred in 19th-century Britain in response to rabies fears (Pemberton &amp; Worboys 2007), and in October, 2006, 50,000 dogs were slaughtered in China in response to a rabies scare. Industrialised livestock, usually in receipt of "herd and flock medicine," where problems of the individual patient are of little overall concern, can sometimes receive the personalised treatment of the companion animal if they have sufficient</page><page sequence="5">PATIENTS IN VETERINARY SURGERY 359 economic, prestige, or emotional value to their owners. A recent British veterinary textbook published by a small animal veterinary organisation is dedicated to the care of "farm pets" (Roberts &amp; Scott-Park 2008). The subject status of veterinary patients is, therefore, not fixed. Indeed, it can seem very arbitrary, given that all animals are sentient. In veterinary professional terms, animal subject status is usually contained within fairly vague guidelines which say that veterinarians must act to promote the welfare of animals under their care. Defining welfare for veterinary patients is therefore problematical; both under-treatment and over-treatment maybe issues of concern. Over-treatment could constitute the mass slaughter of livestock to control what can be a mild infectious disease, as well as supplying a paraplegic dog with a "wheelchair" cart to allow him to get around. Patient histories can help elucidate some of the complexities inherent in this topic by encouraging a view which takes account of the changing contexts of animal medicine. To do this, we often need to look across species boundaries to explore different veterinary patient categories. Roaring Horses and Troublesome Mares: Surgery and the Equine Body in the Early 20th Century British veterinary surgeon Sir Frederick Hobday is best remembered for his work with horses. He was a surgical specialist and was Principal of the Royal Veterinary College, London, in the 1920s and 1930s. "Hobdayed" is the term still used to describe an operation he carried out on hundreds of horses. The operation, pioneered by Williams at Cornell University, quiets horses known as "roarers." In these animals, nerve degeneration in the neck causes the vocal folds to collapse inwards. When horses breathe heavily during work, this partial paralysis in the larynx causes air turbulence and a roaring sound. The condition impairs physical performance as well as being alarming to hear. The Hobday operation opens up the airway, allowing the air to flow more smoothly. The horse breathes more naturally and can be worked normally. Hobday was one of the leading British veterinarians of the period, especially in surgery. His access to patients and his enthusiasm for seeking them out, allowed him to build up impressive case series incorporating large numbers of animals. Another equine treatment he pursued was the correction of "troublesome mares" by the surgical technique of ovariotomy. The erratic behaviour of these animals during oestrus (reproductive cycling) made them awkward and embarrassing to work. Hobday actively sought cases and was prepared to travel the length and</page><page sequence="6">360 ANDREW GARDINER breadth of the country to operate on suitable ones and then monitor for improvements in temperament. He once travelled from London to Duns in the Scottish Borders to operate on a troublesome mare. The horse was not valuable and the owner was poor, but Hobday offered to operate "for any sort of fee" in order to have the case.2 Ovariotomy was also used extensively in women to treat what was seen as a parallel condition of "menstrual madness" (Studd 2006 ). In these activities, Hobday was performing coordinated clinical research in veterinary surgery, something which had not taken place before. Anecdotalism and surgical individuality were countered with standardisation and statistics, as in human medicine and surgery, and Hobday lectured and published widely. The 19th-century history of the British veterinary profession reveals veterinarians to be highly individualistic: they worked independently, in relative isolation, ran their own businesses, and negotiated their own way through conflicting theories surrounding animal disease and its treatment. At this time, veterinary colleges were privately run by independently-minded principals who often propagated their own views and did not hesitate to criticise their competitors. Nationally, professional organisation was poor, a fact which made it difficult for the profession to speak with one voice. This hindered early attempts to gain a legal monopoly on animal treatment because the profession did not form a cohesive body, able to agree on matters medical or organisational (Pattison 1983). In the clinical area, in the first quarter of the 20th century, Hobday's work was therefore very significant. By this time, the profession had come together, a Veterinary Surgeons Act had been passed (in 1879), and veterinary colleges were beginning to associate with universities. However, except in a very few cases, animal disease was not being examined in any systematic way and veterinary research was virtually non-existent.3 An added problem was the realisation that the future was going to be mechanical and that the noble and useful horse, the animal upon which veterinary self-identity had been based, was in decline. Hobday's clinical work in this context was timely, innovative, and comparative. He gave frequent papers and collaborated with human doctors at the Comparative Medicine section of the Royal Society of Medicine. In 1900, he brought out the first edition of what was to be a popular and significant book (Hobday 1900a). 2 Original letter in "Letters to W. Lothian," Edinburgh University Special Collections, RDV 31. ' The Prain Report in 1920 highlighted the severe shortcomings in British veterinary research.</page><page sequence="7">PATIENTS IN VETERINARY SURGERY 361 Surgery in the Small Animal Clinic Surgical Diseases of the Dog was first published in 1900 and quickly attained popularity as a leading surgical textbook for British veterinary students and practitioners. It was reprinted regularly throughout the first half of the 20th century, even during the austere war years. Later editions included cats in the title. It was a landmark title in clinical veterinary surgery because it was dedicated to small animals and because it advocated surgical routines closely modelled on human operating protocols. In particular, the book emphasised proper preparation of the patient and surgeon, antiseptic treatment of instruments, materials and consumables, and good anaesthetic practice based on the safe administration of chloroform. The anaesthetics chapter was one of the longest. This substantial preliminary section was followed by a systems-based approach to surgical disorders, the text being illustrated with photographs of clinical patients and surgical specimens, and with diagrams, tables, and charts. The format was very similar to human surgical textbooks. End chapters covered X-rays, the use of radium, and surgical nursing. Hobday used surgical statistics to convince a sometimes sceptical veterinary audience of the methods he was using. In the first half of the 20th century, many general veterinary practitioners considered chloroform unsafe in small animals and would not use it. They also adopted a somewhat "informal" approach to surgical asepsis, consistent with the relatively non-invasive procedures they were performing. In the vast majority of practices, small animal surgery would never be carried out in a dedicated operating room with field drapes, gowns, and other human-style precautions as recommended by Hobday. He promoted his ideas vigorously, especially in relation to anaesthesia: The dog is an excellent subject for chloroform, probably no animal is better. It is the method of administration and of securing [to the table] which has been at fault for so many years. ... At the present time, I have a record of over 800 consecutive canine chloroformisations, the majority of which have been done by students, all . . . being practically amateur anaesthetists, the patients being principally Free Clinique cases, not in any way prepared and taken just as they came, some in good and some in poor condition. (Hobday 1900b) Most of the cases in Hobday's book came from the Royal Veterinary College's charity practice or Free Clinique, also called the Poor People's Outpatient Department or Cheap Clinic (Figs 1,2). This clinical service had a very large caseload of small animals. Treatment was free to London's poor, although Hobday later introduced a flat fee of one shilling. This</page><page sequence="8">362 ANDREW GARDINER fee, however, included all necessary tests and treatment irrespective of the cost to the College. Access to such a large clinical population and the freedom to pursue surgical cases to a conclusion, allowed Hobday confidently to dispel what he considered to be myths surrounding the dangers of canine anaesthesia and surgery. Fig. 1 - Queue at the Royal Veterinary College's Poor People's Outpatient Clinic, Camden Town, London, around 1930 (Simon Jackson, Royal Veterinary College, London). Fig. 2 - Patient from the Poor People s Outpatient Department receiving an X-ray following an accident (Simon Jackson, Royal Veterinary College, London).</page><page sequence="9">PATIENTS IN VETERINARY SURGERY 363 So confident was Hobday in the safety of his rational anaesthetic technique for dogs, and so keen to seize opportunities to promote it, that he felt it necessary to report the "extreme rarity" of the death of an elderly dog in 1901. A 13-year-old collie was undergoing surgery for mammary cancer and died unexpectedly A post mortem revealed the cause: there were secondary tumours in the lungs. Hobday's conclusion was that the anaesthetic was therefore not to blame (Hobday 1901). Hobday advocated general anaesthesia for humane, cost, and convenience reasons. Methylated chloroform anaesthesia was cheap - it cost two-pence or three-pence for a dog or cat, six-pence or a shilling for a horse. Safer anaesthesia on an immobilized patient allowed for more adventurous surgery. Responding enthusiastically to a German article advocating the technique of laparotomy in veterinary species, Hobday wrote that, providing sound surgical and anaesthetic principles were adhered to, exploratory laparotomy could be carried out "almost with impunity" in small animal patients whenever the diagnosis was uncertain (Hobday 1900c). Breaching the abdomen was not the only innovation. Hobday's book included designs for cosmetic glass eyes, artificial legs, and even false teeth. Illustrations for the artificial legs depicted two different models: a cosmetic and life-like leg fitted to a Blenheim spaniel (a private "middle class" patient from Hobday's successful small animal practice in Kensington), and a more basic and functional prop attached to a cross-breed dog that was treated at the Poor People's Clinic. The false teeth, again for a "middle class" Kensington dog, had been made after collaboration with a London dentist. They were deemed to be a great success. The canine recipient reportedly tore the meat off a mutton chop immediately after they had been inserted. The dentures were worn regularly for 18 months at which point the dog (and presumably the teeth) was stolen and never heard of again. Another denture recipient was not so grateful and spat the teeth out as soon as he judged his master was not looking.4 These anecdotes illustrate the transfer of techniques between human and animal medicine. Hobday treated dogs like humans not because of anthropomorphism but because, in comparative medical terms, that seemed the obvious thing to do. When humans had a leg amputated, they got a prosthesis. It seemed sensible to do the same thing for dogs. Not many dogs had had their legs amputated before Hobday's time, mainly due to the concerns surrounding anaesthesia. Instead, they would have been destroyed or just left to get along as best they could with 4 Anecdotes in his autobiography (Hobday 1938).</page><page sequence="10">364 ANDREW GARDINER chronic disability or pain. No-one had seen enough three-legged dogs to make an informed clinical judgment about how the animals coped. Hobday realized that dogs could cope without one, and sometimes (in small, light animals) even two legs - provided the other limbs were functional. The use of leg prosthetics fell away, as they often literally did, anyway. Interestingly, there may currently be a resurgence in their use in veterinary orthopaedic surgery as a means of treating amputee dogs with severe degenerative joint disease, where pathology in the remaining legs means that loss of a limb proves more difficult (Fig. 3). The problems of ageing and geriatric companion animals, an expanding area in veterinary medicine, may necessitate a return to prostheses. Fig. 3 - Dog with titanium alloy prosthesis on the lower forelimb following surgery for bone cancer. The usual procedure would be to amputate the leg. The flexible prosthesis is the same type as that used in disabled athletes. (Noel Fitzpatrick, Fitzpatrick Referrals, Godalming, Surrey). Hobday's numerous articles promoting his ideas on anaesthesia and surgery were received well in the veterinary press. Around the time of first publication of Surgical Diseases of the Dog, the veterinary profession had been coming under increasing attack for lax operating practices, especially in relation to infection. The journal Land and Water criticised the profession and compared it unfavorably with medicine just before a review of Hobday's book was printed in The Veterinary Record. Hobday was seen as pointing the way forward (Anon 1900). Surgery on the Farm Not all animals are equal in veterinary medicine. Hobday's Kensington canine patient got a life-like limb, but the Free Clinique dog's prosthesis was aesthetically less pleasing and perhaps less well-fitted. In veterinary medicine, asymmetries apply even more across species than within them. Twenty-five years after the publication of Hobday's small animal book emphasizing safe anaesthesia and clean surgery, The Veterinary Record printed a leading article entitled "Castration of male and female pigs,"</page><page sequence="11">PATIENTS IN VETERINARY SURGERY 365 by Captain W. Wallace Kerr MRCVS (Kerr 1925). This is an interesting article in terms of both timing and content. In his brief introduction, the author refers to the status of the profession, to anxieties being felt about the disappearance of its main species and symbolic animal of identity (the noble and useful horse), and to the necessity of extending the remit of veterinary surgery into previously neglected farm animal species and operations, thereby excluding lay practitioners. The article is essentially a technical one, describing the " castration" of male and female pigs in detail with step-by-step instructions and photographs. In this sense, it resembles Hobday's accounts of staged surgical procedures. Like Hobday and like human surgical writers, Kerr described what to expect using the senses of sight and touch, and what to do in order to accomplish the surgical goal safely. However, no anaesthetic was used and the operations were carried out in the field with no formal precautions of any type prior to surgery. This is particularly relevant when considering the operation in female pigs. "Castration" (i.e. ovariohysterectomy) of these animals meant an actual abdominal incision through the flank in order to remove the ovaries and uterus. This operation at first sight appears to be a terrible business, not only because it necessitates real abdominal surgery, but from the method in controlling the animal. The writer has known of the unpractical [use of] an operating table and having the help of several assistants, whereas the series of photographs accompanying this article will best illustrate the method adopted from early times. It will be found a back-aching business to commence with, but with practice it becomes quite natural to the operator. (Kerr 1925, 21) The procedure as illustrated was barbaric but no worse than that performed by lay castrators and the author noted that it could be financially profitable if only veterinary surgeons could bring themselves to attend to this lowly farm animal. With regard to antiseptics and disinfectants, he admitted that they were "conspicuous by their absence" in his descriptions (Kerr 1925, 21). He made reference to the procedure for ovariohysterectomy as described in a standard surgical textbook, Fleming's Operative Veterinary Surgery (Fleming 1884) and described the protocols and safeguards described in the book as "absolutely impracticable and superfluous" (Kerr 1925, 24). In his own operations, he noted that [disinfection of the styles, yards, etc., have not been done, the operating knife, needle, suturing thread have not been sterilized, the operator's hands have not been antiseptically treated, no antiseptic precautions have been</page><page sequence="12">366 ANDREW GARDINER advocated whatsoever. The seat of operation has not been treated before, during, or after the operation, with respect. (Kerr 1925, 24) Kerr went on to speculate why the pig, living in filthy surroundings, should apparently be so immune to infection whereas the same operation carried out in similar circumstances on a dog or cat would, he speculated, be accompanied by "harassing sequelae and fatal results" (Kerr 1925, 24).5 He himself performed castrations and spay operations (ovariohysterectomies) on dogs and cats, following Hobday-style procedure, and yet still encountered problems with post-operative infections. At the end of his account, he wondered if perhaps the peritoneal fluid of pigs was somehow especially prophylactic against sepsis. Kerr's pigs had neither the benefit of anaesthesia nor clean operating conditions. They were surgical patients and were dealt with individually up to a point, but they had few patient privileges, being literally stood upon in order to restrain them for surgery. There are no data comparing infection rates across veterinary species, but Kerr's sentiments regarding susceptibility to surgical infections in animals were not unusual in the veterinary press at this time, demonstrating that in 1925 surgical germ practices were not generally accepted in veterinary practice, except in certain elite institutions and practices. Evidence from historical practice case studies suggests that regular veterinary practices rarely implemented full surgical germ precautions even well beyond the 1920s (Gardiner 2009). It is still not exceptional for British veterinary surgeons to operate without wearing gloves, sterile gowns, masks, and hats - the usual appareil of the human surgeon.6 Purpose-designed veterinary hospitals are becoming more common but until the late 1980s and 1990s, the physical fabric and design of regular veterinary practices (often adapted houses or shop units) frequently did not lend itself to provision of dedicated operating rooms, so that animal surgery would quite frequently take place in multi-functional rooms. Does this mean veterinary surgeons remained "in denial" about germ practices throughout the 20th century? Did animal patients genuinely encounter fewer operative infections or was infection simply normalized and accepted with veterinary operative surgery? Were the precautions implemented in human hospitals unnecessary 5 It would also have been illegal to perform this operation in the conscious dog or cat. The Animals (Anaesthetics) Act, 1919, made it illegal to carry out specified surgical procedures without appropriate anaesthetics, but only applied to horses, dogs, cats, and catde. 6 From an informal survey of veterinary students returning from practice placements in 2008/2009.</page><page sequence="13">PATIENTS IN VETERINARY SURGERY 367 overkill and more to do with "theatre" than necessary practice? Some of these questions have yet to be properly explored but the rise of multi-resistant bacterial infections in the late 20th century undoubtedly changed the agenda. Hospital-acquired infection emerged in first human and then veterinary medicine. As well as raising questions about antibiotic usage in both disciplines, the topic led to further developments in the consideration of veterinary patients: the rise of the first patient concern group in British veterinary medicine. A Veterinary Patient Biography and the Advent of Canine Health Activism7 The Patient and Her Condition Bella Moss was a Samoyed bitch owned by Jill Moss, a British actress who is now a full-time canine health activist. Jill had rescued Bella when the dog's previous owners had been unable to look after her properly. Jill bonded immediately with the lively Samoyed and Bella went everywhere with her owner, to auditions, castings, and premieres. The events which eventually gave rise to the Bella Moss Foundation, an organisation dedicated to promoting patient interests in veterinary surgery, started in the most mundane way possible, when Jill took Bella for a walk in a London park. Bella spotted a squirrel and did the usual doggy thing - she enthusiastically chased after it. Suddenly, she pulled up very lame on a hind leg. Jill took Bella to her vet who diagnosed rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament, a ligament in the stifle (knee) joint. Many techniques are described for the repair of cruciate rupture - an indication that no one method returns invariably good results. These methods vary from the extremely conservative (rest and painkillers for three months, with no surgery at all; most dogs will improve after this) to the highly interventionist, such as the recently developed techniques of tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) and triple tibial osteotomy (TTO). These technically demanding surgical procedures involve recontouring the top of the tibia (shin bone) to produce a biomechanically stable joint (see Fig. 4). 7 This section is based on telephone conversations with Jill Moss and information and links on the extensive web sites, www.thebellamossfoundation.com and http://pets-mrsa.com/ .</page><page sequence="14">368 ANDREW GARDINER Fig. 4 - Bone cuts for the newly developed tripletibial osteotomy (TTO) - an extensive procedure in which the canine joint is reconfigured to improve conformation and function (Veterinary Times, Peterborough). Amongst veterinary specialists, different surgeons and institutions may advocate different approaches to this problematic condition. This can sometimes lead to disagreements in the literature (Conzemius 2005; Innes 2006; Coughlan &amp; May 2006). However there are generally agreed parameters regarding when to intervene surgically, even if the choice of procedure remains a different matter. Medium and large breed dogs are considered to do best with surgery; non-surgical options (rest) are usually reserved for small breeds or for those owners unable to afford the considerable expense of complex procedures. The decision to operate on Bella was probably taken given her size. Bella's cruciate ligament was therefore repaired at a local veterinary surgery using one of the prescribed techniques and she was sent home for recuperation. Complications A week later, Bella seemed seriously ill at home. On returning to the veterinary practice, she was diagnosed with a septic arthritis (joint infection). She was kept as an in-patient to treat this serious complication. At Jill's request, referral to a specialist orthopaedic practice was then arranged. Here, further joint surgery was undertaken and Bella was treated for sepsis. It was found Bella was suffering from methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, the so-called "super bug" of the popular press which receives regular headlines in British newspapers amidst calls to clean up "filthy" hospitals (Walker 2007). Bella was discharged from the specialist orthopaedic hospital and sent home on treatment. The intention was to allow the infection to clear and</page><page sequence="15">PATIENTS IN VETERINARY SURGERY 369 then perform reconstructive surgery on her knee joint at a later date to stabilize it. However, Bella became ill once again. The journey to the referral hospital was considered too long, given her condition, and so she returned to her original practice. Knowing that they now had a patient with MRSA, the practice was concerned about cross-infection and had to implement safety measures. Bella was kept apart from other animals in a closed-off consulting room and Jill nursed her there. Bella became recumbent and difficult to turn. She was incontinent and clearly deteriorating. After a fraught 48-hours, Jill, who was nursing her personally, made the decision to let her go. Bella was euthanased in the garden of the veterinary practice. After Bella's death in August 2004 Jill Moss said, "No animal should have to endure what she did, especially such a beautiful soul as my Bella. ... I feel that Bella died unnecessarily, before her time, and because of the ignorance and failure of professionals." Meetings, Measures and Microbes On 19-21st June 2006, almost two years after Bella's euthanasia, Liverpool University's Department of Veterinary Science hosted an international meeting of experts on the subject of MRSA in animals and humans. Delegates attended from British and overseas veterinary schools, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and the Health Protection Agency. The meeting was held under the auspices of The Bella Moss Foundation and Bella's image appeared on all the signage and literature of the proceedings. Jill Moss's journey from being a bereaved and angry pet owner to organising and sharing a speaking platform with clinicians, microbiologists, and health politicians was by any account an unusual one. Her role in this sphere continues to expand and The Bella Moss Foundation, which is focused on the prevention and treatment of serious infections in companion animals, has become a full-time occupation. In veterinary and scientific circles, Jill Moss's movement was from the lay periphery to the expert centre and she now regularly lectures veterinary surgeons, nurses, dog owners, and other health professionals, animal and human. The list of those recruited to help promote The Bella Moss Foundation is diverse: from university professors to media celebrities, alternative practitioners to dyed-in-the-wool reductionists, from those who may prefer the company of animals to those whose interests are more anthropocentric. There is a huge on-line community of bloggers around the general subject, telling the stories of individual dogs (and</page><page sequence="16">370 ANDREW GARDINER people) with MRSA and how microbes have affected their lives. Jill Moss had the right skills and connections to engage with the diverse and sometimes opposing constituencies that result when science meets emotion in companion animal veterinary medicine. Surgery and surgical procedure was and remains the primary focus of The Bella Moss Foundation. Jill believed that Bella was infected because of inadequate safety measures and lax veterinary operating protocols. She also argued that many pet owners, and indeed human patients and their loved ones, were the victims of bad communication in relation to the emotive topic of MRSA, with its often confusing mix of "myth" and "reality." The reason for this was that clinical professionals themselves often did not understand the subject fully or weigh it sufficiently highly in their work or practice. Additionally, in veterinary medicine, procedures in practices that were standard in human operating theatres, such as gloves, gowns, masks, and the use of dedicated operating theatres, were not always implemented. Owners of animals scheduled for surgery were encouraged to question their veterinarians on the precautions they employed and also to view operating facilities in practices and compare them against. The Bella Moss Foundation's checklist of good surgical protocols. The British Small Animal Veterinary Association also brought out its own guidelines for veterinary surgeons. In this, the first publicized veterinary case of MRSA, there was also the issue of zoonotic infection, the risk of human beings becoming infected with an animal infection. This would have been a worry for the staff nursing Bella after her "super bug" diagnosis had been made. One of Jill Moss's central arguments was that the reverse occurred: that her dog was infected during the original cruciate surgery. And indeed, Bella's strain of MRSA was confirmed to be a human, not a canine, one. This led to the suggestion, made by a veterinary surgeon during a radio interview, that Jill may have been the source of her own dog's infection, or that it came from some other source. The important point here is that canine and human patient boundaries were blurred. The microbe did not respect species differences; veterinary and human health concerns became intermingled and human and veterinary practice became one.8 8 The interview was broadcast on the Jeremy Vine radio programme on BBC Radio 2 and can be downloaded from the web site at http://www.thebellamossfoundation.com/links.asp.

Conclusion: Locating the Patient Consideration of the patient in veterinary medicine raises some interesting questions. The topic is an important one in veterinary history and sociology because veterinarians usually identify themselves according to the species of animal which they mostly treat. So practicing veterinarians will call themselves companion animal veterinarians, equine veterinarians, exotic and wildlife veterinarians, farm animal (or, in the US, "food animal") veterinarians, feline veterinarians, mixed practice veterinarians, and so on. One way of mapping historical change in veterinary medicine is to organize discussion around changing species emphasis in education or practice. For those interested in fore-grounding animals in any historical account, this is a useful concept. A narrative of this type, in relation to 20th-century British veterinary medicine, would be that the century started off with horses, passed through a phase in which farm animals, especially dairy cattle, were important, and then finished with the vast majority of veterinarians treating companion animals. Whilst this may be a useful overall summary, basic historical research soon begins to problematise aspects of it. Numerically, far more dogs than horses were treated in the early 20th century in British veterinary schools, and</page><page sequence="18">372 ANDREW GARDINER evidence suggests that the same happened in other countries.9 Even well before the "rise of small animals," usually stated as being post-1950 in Britain, there were many practices which specialized solely in their treatment. Looking at animals by species group can therefore take us only so far in terms of historical explanation. It soon becomes apparent that a more nuanced account requires closer proximity to the individual animal recipients of treatment. In the latter half of this paper, the emergence of patient advocacy in veterinary medicine is presented as part of a longer historical narrative concerning surgical patients and the various ways in which veterinarians have interacted with them. Canine health activism is a relatively new phenomenon, but one which seems destined to grow considerably in the future. In human medicine, the personal patient story acts as a focal point which campaigners may use as an example, usually of poor practice or of failed recognition of a disease or condition. There are now parallels in companion animal veterinary medicine. Canine health activism is prominent in the United States and studies have been made of networks of information sharing within dog agility communities and amongst breeders (Haraway 2008, 95-132). What makes The Bella Moss Foundation slightly different is the emphasis given to the individual veterinary patient, so that the Foundation itself memorializes the dog. With the development of new veterinary specialities, such as oncology and geriatric care, additional veterinary concern and advocacy groups can be expected. Issues surrounding the terminal care of animal patients and how death is to be managed is a natural sequel to the development of these specialities. Previously, these issues were very much left within the hands of the veterinarian but, increasingly, pet owners and family wish to be involved in decision making concerning the timing and arrangements of end-of-life decisions in companion animals and organisations have emerged to support them.10 Is veterinary medicine therefore becoming more human, more humane? A modern companion animal hospital, in its outward appearance and internal organisation, closely resembles the human 9 Utrecht veterinary school, often cited as emphasising cattle above other species and praised for this in the British Loveday Report into veterinary education (1944), also probably treated very large numbers of small animals in the early 20th century (Peter Koolmes, personal correspondence). The main problem is that few people have counted the numbers of small animals in any school or country. My research on all British veterinary school reveals very large numbers of small animals when com pared to other species in the early decades of the 20th century. 10 The Nikki Hospice Foundation in a non-profit organisation dedicated to providing advice and information on the home care of dying companion animals in the US. See: http://www.pethospice.org/ NHFP%20Info.htm. Britain does not yet have a similar organisation. The University of California at Davis hosts international symposia on veterinary hospice care.</page><page sequence="19">PATIENTS IN VETERINARY SURGERY 373 equivalent and veterinary specialties directly parallel those in medicine. Animal diabetics receive insulin; those that are lame or crippled with arthritis receive new hips and knees; those with fractures can have anatomic repairs using specialized implants; those with irregular or weak heart beats can have pacemakers and new valves; cats with failing kidneys can be transplanted with new ones. These examples of "human medicine for animals" may seem wholly inappropriate to some. However, each of these advances or technologies can alternatively be seen as "animal medicine for humans" since the first "patients" to receive each of these treatments were animals. It is true that they were not companion animals (although a few of them almost made that transition),11 and so they were not bona fide patients as such, being instead model animals residing in research laboratories. Once the treatment or technique was perfected in the animal model, it was utilised in human medicine, but only to then find its way back into animals again in clinical veterinary medicine. These exchanges are often more complex than they first appear and are another dimension of "one medicine" (Degeling 2009b). They raise interesting questions concerning shared diseases and how veterinary and human knowledges interact and may do so in the future. In the sequence of knowledge exchanges, human patients often serve as the model for veterinary patients, so that animal medicine comes from the human clinic, whereas human medicine comes from the animal lab. Farm animals are not excluded from these exchanges; the fields of nutrition and reproduction medicine show similar transfers of knowledge (Wilmot 2007). In Bella Moss's story, those acting in her memory moved the idea of the veterinary patient beyond that of the animal as a passive recipient of veterinary medicine. As a healing profession, veterinary medicine is unusual. It lies between agriculture and human medicine, between philosophies of "cure very quickly or kill" at one (livestock) end of the spectrum and a form of "human medicine for animals" at the other (companion animal) end. The ambiguous status of the non-human subjects of veterinary medicine has ramifications for fundamental professional paradigms. Historically, this has created a recurring tension and uncertainty about status, role, and purpose, which is directly related to veterinary medicine's diverse and changing patient group and different animals' attributes and associations within human society. In 11 For example, Marjorie, the diabetic dog whose insulin treatment led to the first human patient being treated, seemed to have become "almost" a pet. However she was euthanased when her ex periment ended and the insulin ran out. She had wandered free around the laboratory and Frederick Banting could not bear to be present when she was killed (Bliss 1982; Gardiner 2004).</page><page sequence="20">374 ANDREW GARDINER a social history of veterinary medicine, veterinarians and their patients are inextricably linked. The interdisciplinary study of more "concrete" veterinary practices will further reveal a rich and interesting strand of animal studies.
