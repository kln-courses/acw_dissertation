In some cases, they have proven to be problematic even as to which of the two reigns of this king they should properly be assigned.1 The divine couple bronzes present a case in point: they were placed in the second reign by Percy Gardner,2 followed by 1 The term "divine couple" as used in this paper has been borrowed from the late great scholar of classical Middle Eastern numismatics, Henri Seyrig. In his article "Trésor monétaire de Nisibe," RN 1955, p. 109, he coined the phrase "un grand couple divin" for the issues here discussed.

Henri Seyrig in his "Antiquités Syriennes," 89-90, Syria 47 (1970), pp. 86-87, 91-92 and 114-16, approaches the subject in terms of a Semitic cult. He sees the cult as ranging broadly across southern Palestine and Syria, into Babylonia and Susiana, from the middle of the second century B.C. to the second century A.D. Special note should be made of a statue at the museum of Suweida, which he illustrates (p. 92, fig. 11), showing the deity with his polos, cornucopia and patera, and also of the bas-relief from Tang-i-Sarvak in Susiana (pl. 19). The proposed appellatives of the male deity range from "Baalshamin (?)" in the Hauran (p. 92, fig. 11), "Zeus Bêlos?" at Seleucia on the Tigris (pp. 91 and 115), and "Ahuramazda-Bêl?" in Susiana (pp. 91, 114-15 and pl. 19). The general premise of syncretism between local Semitic 'Baals' and the hellenistic Zeus within the Graeco-Oriental cities of western Asia is consistent with shifting political and cultural influences in the area, which for centuries had been contested by east and west. The concept that Semitic elements of these cities revered the deity as their local protective spirit (Seyrig, p. 92) is not inconsistent with my approach.

DIES AND FLANS In Series 1 the obverse die of coin 1 would seem to stand by itself, as perhaps an early pilot issue. Those of 2 and 7 appear to have been cut by the same hand, one beardless, the other bearded. In Series 2, which comprises the bulk of the overall issue, we find no less than five, and probably six, distinct obverse dies produced. Coins 24-29 are stylistically cohesive and distinct from the others, and appear to involve more than one obverse die. The portraits of this issue are to be noted for their unique realism in comparison to the other, relatively uncommon, portrait issues in bronze of Demetrius II during his first reign.</page><page sequence="5">Demetrius II's Coinage at Nisibis 129 Table 1 Die Links Series 1 - *14 Copenhagen *1 Babelon - *15 BM *2 Berlin - *16 BM - *3 Babelon - 17 W.

In only one case (12 and 13) can we establish a definite reverse die link, how- ever, and stylistic characteristics of the reverse dies seem to change sequentially with the obverse die changes. The local cult imagery of the reverse dies (discussed below) may reflect a certain measure of the reli- gious syncretism manifest at the interface of Greek and oriental cultures during these times - particularly if one or more of the die engravers had intended to depict the male figure wearing a tunic over his chiton (see notes 9, 10 and 29). The flans vary: they are regular under Series 1 but sharply bevelled, without regard to whether the spread side was placed under the punch or on the anvil die, as in Series 2.</page><page sequence="6">130 Wayne Moore MONEYERS While Series 1 lacks any indication of the responsible moneyers, Series 2 has three distinct officials signing the reverse dies. H, with the variants hP, "H and "H , saw the issue through to the end. His associates E and Y appear with him continuously until we come to the reverse die of 29, where they are replaced by A (or A). A subordinate, O, appears to have signed some of the later dies. Other subordinates, such as a possible r as well as a possible I, may only have been die engraver's blunders. The predominance of H, E, Y and later O (with Ä at the end of the issue) suggest a tightly knit group of moneyers who presided over the rather prolific Series 2 issues. Due to its lack of official signature, 30 remains questionable and may belong with Series 1. ICONOGRAPHY: AGATHOS DAIMON AND AGATHE TYCHE The reverse type of these bronze issues portrays the two deities with identical attributes of polos (sometimes described as kalathos or modius) and cornucopia. As an established fertility symbol the cornucopia sug- gests that our divine couple, who greet each other in harmonious consort, are themselves symbolic of fertility and well-being. Even the dress appears to be similar, with both figures wearing a long chiton.10 The male figure may also be wearing a tunic, while the female figure may be wearing a peplos over her chiton. What appears to be a tunic and peplos may, however, simply be an archaistic over-fold of the chiton on both figures. The worn condition of the coins and the generally crude die engraving make such a distinction difficult to determine. The poloi suggest that the figures are representative of demotic cult images, perhaps copying actual statues (see above, n. 9). The male figure, with his polos and cornucopia, has been identified on issues from Seleucia on the Tigris during the reigns of Demetrius I 10 Babelon (above, n. 4), 939-41, describes the dress of the male figure as a "tu- nique talaire."</page><page sequence="7">Demetrius II's Coinage at Nisibis 131 (Plate 31, B),11 Demetrius II (?),12 Phraates II (Plate 31, D)13 and on subsequent autonomous bronzes (Plate 30, A).14 Closely associated with the Demetrius I bronzes is a contemporary issue depicting the female counterpart of the male figure (Plate 31, C).15 Both figures share the attributes of polos and cornucopia. Taken together, they were the proto- type of the divine couple found on the bronzes of Demetrius II. This iconography appears to have been limited, under the Seleucid kings, exclusively to the coinage of Demetrius I and II. The female figure from our divine couple, commonly described as Tyche or Tyche-Demeter, was adopted by Demetrius I as his family badge on the tetradrachms of his western mints and at Seleucia on the Tigris.16 Her cult became particularly prominent at Seleucia as attested by the tetradrachms of his son Demetrius II17 and subsequent Parthian 11 Bronze f 4.32, BM 1931-4-6-200.

Carrying the same attributes, especially the cornucopia, such a figure could only be Agathos Daimon, an archaic fertility figure often assimi- lated with Olympian and lesser deities during hellenistic times.21 His image on these coins has been identified with Serapis,22 and in other art 18 Interregnum, ca. 127 B.C.: Suse , pl. 71, 1-2; D.

On the tetradrachms of Demetrius I and II from Seleucia on the Tigris, Tyche holds a short scepter, while on these she holds a Nike who crowns her in exactly the same manner as the male figure on the Phraates II tetradrachms (Plate 31, D). This male figure wears the same female dress of a long chiton and has the same attributes (polos and cornucopia) as Tyche. In fact, the only major differences between the types are the beard and the form of the throne; his is supported by a sometimes exaggerated leg typical of that which supports the throne of Zeus on hel- lenistic coinages in general. 19 Jenkins (above, n. 11), p. 5, see his n. 16, argues for Tyche on the basis of an apparently turreted crown on this figure on the Beistegui stater (see his p. 2, I [a], "Paris, Collection Beistegui no. 37, 8.45 gm."). For cautions on the attribution to Tyche, see Newell (above, n. 16), p. 38, and Suse , p. 142; but see also Newell (above, n. 13), p. 176, where he tentatively suggests liáyadr¡ Tv%r'1" for this goddess. 20 Babelon, 709-20 ("Nereide ailee"); MFA 2167-70 ("winged Tritoness"). 21 J.

He appears with the appellative "Zeus Epitelios, Phi- lios," holding his cornucopia and reclining beside his wife. The architrave has an inscription identifying "... Tyche Agathe (as) the god's wife,"26 A correlative monument of Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche in their anthropomorphic versions can be seen in a relief from Delos, wherein the Agathodaemon serpent dominates the central motif (Plate 31, E).27 Here the male and female figures, on either side of the large bearded serpent, share the same attributes of polos, cornucopia and long chiton as on our Demetrius II bronzes. Another relief, of imperial date, from Epidauros again depicts the bearded Agathos Daimon with his cornu- copia, while incorporating his serpent incarnation as a lesser part of the motif.28 Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche are not deities with specific per- sonalities, as were the Olympian gods of Homer, but are rather more generic in nature. They are manifestations of the demoi in a collective sense, where various appellatives have been attached to them from place 23 See Vermeule (above, n. 22), no. 37, for a statuette of "Dionysos-Sabazios" which is identical in every respect, save style, with those mentioned by Küthmann. Bronze votive plaques, of imperial date from Razgrad, depict Sabazios as a horseman holding a cornucopia: R. F. Hoddinott, Bulgaria in Antiquity (New York, 1975), p. 165. Another chthonian fertility god with attributes of patera and cornucopia, "probably Zalmoxis," can be seen in the Theos Megas at Thracian Odessos, whose votive statuettes are often crowned with ivy, or vine, in a Dionysiac fashion: Hoddi- nott, p. 50.

The civic (or demotic cult) nature of the divine couple iconography is strongly suggested by these examples. Agathos Daimon, like Agathe Tyche as the "good fortune" of the demos , is a similar conceptual representation of the "good spirit" of departed ancestors.32 He is a protective spirit of the family, from that of the individual citizen to that of the king, and in a broader sense he may represent the heroic ancestral heritage of the state.33 He is the seed carrier, the genetic code or paterfamilias of the family, the demos , the polis and of the royal line. His function is that of progenitor, the male force - hence, his usual attribute of fruitfulness and fertility, the cornu- copia.34 The function of his consort, Agathe Tyche, is that of generatrix or seed receiver; the two together symbolizing procreation and continued existence for the clan, the city and the people at large. Macrobius35 brings this concept down to the level of the individual through an astrological interpretation: the zodiacal position of the sun 29 Harrison (above, n. 21), pp. 279, 288, 302-3; Cook (above, n. 21), p. 1160. In Mesopotamian mythology we find a similar oriental counterpart to the Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche couple in the protective spirits of the individual and of the royal line, known as "šēdu" and "ištaru" (Ištar): A.

Thus, the daimon provides the seed (propensities), while tyche carries it to term (fate or actuality). These two deities then, which by definition lack specific personalities, are strictly functional in concept and they comprise the divine couple. There is evidence that they were sometimes conceptually merged. A bronze issue of imperial date from Melos36 shows Tyche as a bearded male figure standing in the same posture and with the same attributes as the more orthodox female Agathe Tyche, who figures on a relief exca- vated by the British School at Melos in 1896.37 Another issue of imperial date personifies the Agathos Daimon concept by incorporating the Dionysiac attribute of a thyrsos into the motif of a city-god wearing the turreted crown of Tyche - a "young Dionysos as city-god" - at Teos.38 An example of such gender transference, or androgyny, might be seen in the bearded figure appearing on the Phraates II tetradrachms (Plate 31, D). This figure has been identified as the "Asiatic Dionysos" by E. T. Newell.39 While he lacks specific Dionysiac attributes,40 he does have the polos and cornucopia and sits in exactly the same posture as the Tyche so common on the preceding tetradrachm issues from Seleucia on the Tigris.41 On these issues the Agathos Daimon figure would seem to supplant the Tyche figure from the preceding Seleucid issues, perhaps because of the transference of dynastic hegemony. 36 F.

Newell attributes the divine couple bronzes of Demetrius II to Seleucia on the Tigris, based upon the similarity of their reverse type with that of the autonomous issue illustrated here (Plate 30, A).42 However, the larger flans and the presence of control marks or mono- grams on the Demetrius II coins represent characteristics quite incon- sistent with the bronze production of Seleucia at this time.43 No exam- ples of this issue are reported from the Seleucia excavations (nor from any other excavations) and the slim provenance records that we have seem to point to a northern Mesopotamian mint.44 The large number of extant specimens indicates an extensive issue over a prolonged period, which makes their absence in the Seleucia excavations strongly sugges- tive of another, perhaps closely associated, mint employing the same demotic cult iconography so prominent on the Seleucian issues.45 If we remove the divine couple types of Demetrius II from Seleucia on the Tigris, then, to which reign of this king do these issues belong ? On the one hand, the inscription, lacking the epithet "Philadelphou," sug- 42 E. T. Newell, review of Coins from Seleucia on the Tigris by Robert Harbold McDowell (Ann Arbor, 1935) in AJA 41 (1937), p. 516. See above, n. 14. Any attri- bution of the Demetrius II coins to Seleucia on the Tigris presumes his first reign, since after the defeat of Antiochus VII Seleucia was never again under Seleucid authority. 43 The bronze production of Seleucia on the Tigris during the reigns of Demetrius I, Alexander I and Demetrius II consistently utilized smaller flans, without control marks or monograms, and usually incorporated a dotted border on the reverse; the divine couple bronzes of Demetrius II never have any sort of reverse border; Susef pl. 27, O, and pls. 28-30. 44 Examples have appeared in the markets of Beirut, Damascus and Tehran (7, 22 and 24), while 14 appears to be from eastern Syria. In a letter of 30 March 1984, Mr. Levante relates that this piece came from a large collection accumulated during the 1920s by the Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, which was formed exclusively in eastern Syria and Mesopotamia where he had his constituancy. Mr. Spaer relates that 28 was acquired directly from a dealer in Jerusalem. 45 See Suse , pp. 152-53, for further reservations about the attribution of these issues to Seleucia.</page><page sequence="13">Demetrius II's Coinage at Nisibis 137 gests the second reign,46 while on the other, the portrait, ranging from beardless to lightly bearded, appears to be that of an adolescent. This accords closely with what we might expect of a portrait of the young king, who would have been about 20 years of age when he embarked upon his eastern campaign against the Parthians in 140 B.C.47 The numismatic evidence indicates that Demetrius was released from Parthian captivity and immediately commenced his second reign with a quite full beard.48 That he arrived at Antioch on the Orontes in the spring of 129 B.C. with an already advanced growth of beard is attested to by his portrait on the brief series of tetradrachms struck there until no later than the spring of 128 B.C., while his tetradrachms struck at Damascus in the year TĪTP (183 S.E. = spring - Oct. 129 B.C.) also depict him with a full beard.49 It would be logical to assume that, upon his arrival at Antioch, Demetrius would have immediately ordered the issuance of coinage with his true effigy - and that the die cutters there would have been constrained to copy his actual features. Given the examples from Damascus noted above, dated to a period of no longer than six months, and the fact that we have no dated issues from the second reign portray- ing Demetrius with anything less than a full beard, one can assume 46 CSE , above, n. 7. 47 See E. R. Bevan, The House of Seleucus 2 (London, 1902), p. 232 and Appendix R. 48 MacDonald's attribution ( Hunter 3, p. 89) of the Demetrius II divine couple to the second reign is based upon the evidence of a tetradrachm dated 183 A.S. (ie., spring-Oct. 129 B.C.), formerly in the Bunbury collection (see Edward H. Bunbury "Rare and Unpublished Coins of the Seleucidan Kings of Syria," NC 1883, pp. 100- 102, pl. 6, 4), which would appear to display a very slight beard with a moustache. E. T. Newell, Late Seleucid Mints in Ake-Ptolemais and Damascus , ANSNNM 84 (1939), p. 50, has since expressed the opinion that the full beard on this coin "has been tooled away in modern times." Dr. Price has informed me that the bronze coin of Sidon in the British Museum trays dated 182 A.S. (Oct. 131-Oct. 130 B.C.), which was formerly attributed to Demetrius II by Gardner (BMC Sel, p. 79, 27), has now been transferred to Antiochus VII on the basis of the portrait. A photo of this coin, kindly provided by Dr. Price, seems to confirm the new attribution, which might serve to dispel any arguments, based upon this piece, that Demetrius II was released several months prior to the defeat of Antiochus VII by Phraates II in spring of 129 B.C. 49 See Newell (above, n. 16), p. 84, pl. 10, nos. 20-21; also, Newell (above, n. 48), pl. 8, no. 67.</page><page sequence="14">138 Wayne Moore that he adopted the oriental custom of growing a long beard while in Parthian captivity. As noted above, the lightly bearded bronze issues are of such quan- tity as to suggest a prolonged period of production, perhaps lasting a year or more. This reinforces the notion that we have here the portrait of an adolescent, not a mature man as Demetrius had become when com- mencing his second reign in 129 B.C. It therefore seems likely that the lightly bearded types of Demetrius II were issued during the latter part of his first reign, while he was cam- paigning against the generals of Mithradates I, between spring of 140 B.C. and his capture in spring or summer of 139 B.C.50 Seleucia on the Tigris had been occupied by Mithradates I by July of 141 B.C.,51 ap- parently without resistance,52 while Demetrius was preoccupied with the usurper Tryphon in the western part of his empire. It was not until spring of the following year that Demetrius was able to raise a counter- offensive against the Parthian king. It was, no doubt, his intention to reclaim the eastern provinces from the Parthians so that he might use the resources and manpower there to fuel his war effort in the west.53 The numismatic evidence from Dura-Europos indicates that Demetrius did not take the southern route into Babylonia, but more than likely marched into the east along the northern route through Upper Mesopo- tamia and down the Tigris (if, in fact, he did not march directly into Media).54 Situated along this route was the major Graeco-Macedonian city of Nisibis, which had operated previously as a Seleucid royal mint.55 50 On the dating of his eastern campaign see Suse, pp. 362 and 370. See also, 1 Macc. 14. On the date of his capture see Suse , p. 369, n. 1, and p. 371. 51 A. T.

Royal issues were produced at Nisibis from the reign of Seleucus I continuously through that of Antiochus III; but see also, CSE , p. 91, where the coinage is said to begin with Antiochus II. Although its production peaked during the reign of Antiochus III, Nisibis continued to issue tetradrachms under Seleucus IV: O. Merkholm, "Le monnayage de Séleucus IV a Nisibe," RN 1965, pp. 44-50. No royal issues are known during the reign of Antio-</page><page sequence="15">Demetrius II's Coinage at Nisibis 139 Strategically located along a major east-west transit route and military highway, Nisibis would have made an ideal staging area and base of operation for the eastern campaign of Demetrius II. In all probability, he followed in the footsteps of Antiochus III, whose own eastern anabasis through this city proved to be far more successful.56 It is to Nisibis then, that we would attribute the divine couple bronzes of Demetrius II, rather than to Seleucia on the Tigris. This city was previously a royal mint and lies along the most likely route of his march into the eastern provinces. The stylized portrait of Series 1 suggests that the die cutters were not initially familiar with his true likeness, perhaps indicating a start-up operation, and the volume of the issue would seem to preclude Seleucia on the Tigris as a possibility after its occupation by Mithradates I in mid-141 B.C.57 The placement of the diadem end over the neck on Series 2 is out of keeping with the stylistic tradition of Seleucia,58 while at Nisibis we find this stylistic device chus IV, only municipal bronzes with his portrait, however Nisibis may have resumed marginal operation as a royal mint under Demetrius I (see above, n. 16) and Alexan- der I (note commentary under CSE 1003). In a letter to the writer dated 30 March 1982, Morkholm expressed the opinion that the tetradrachms of Demetrius I ( Suse 572) and Alexander I (Suse 311), with monogram ¿ or &amp; , "may belong to Nisibis." He suggested that Suse , pl. 29, A (Alexander I), might represent the transference of an obverse die from Seleucia on the Tigris to Nisibis. 56 WSM , pp. 69 and 75-76. Arthur Houghton, in "The Elephants of Nisibis" in this issue of ANSMN , presents convincing evidence that a number of issues of Antiochus III, previously assigned to Ecbatana by E. T. Newell, may now be given to Nisibis, thereby emphasizing the importance of this city as a major provincial mint under the Seleucid kings. 57 The Parthian issues of Mithradates I at Seleucia began shortly after the city's occupation in July of 141 B.C. and continued, in regular succession (with dated issues of 140/39 and 139/38 B.C.), until his death; see Suse , pp. 369 and 371. It seems unlikely that Demetrius II could have retaken Seleucia for any length of time suf- ficient to explain the volume of the divine couple production, while the issues of the Parthian king at this city do not seem to have been seriously interrupted; see Suse , p. 372. 58 A minor exception to this can be noted for two issues of Demetrius I; Susef pl. 27, B and D.</page><page sequence="16">140 Wayne Moore employed, in imitation of the Antioch issues, during the latter part of the reign of Antiochus III and continuing into the reign of Seleucus IV.59 The ancient city of Nisibis has not yet been scientifically excavated, but a coin hoard found in its environs, published by Henri Seyrig, has 12 examples of an anonymous bronze issue60 depicting a sometimes laureate, sometimes diademed, bearded head on the obverse, while the reverse carries the turreted head of Tyche, who is sometimes diademed, sometimes not. These issues are dated to approximately the first half of the first century B.C. and are considered by Seyrig to represent a divine couple. Although he tentatively suggests an attribution to the Arab king of Osrhoene, Abgar II, the issue is without inscription and the quantity suggests a local origin. On these the male figure is conveniently identified as Zeus, yet we might remember that the male counterpart and husband of Tyche was Agathos Daimon - who was often assimilated with various forms of Zeus in demotic cult practices. These issues, lacking royal or civic inscriptions, would appear to be of a purely demotic nature in a region where royal sovereignty remained uncertain.61 The existence of this issue suggests that an iconography of "the people," a cult of the demos , which had found its manifestation on the bronze issues of Demetrius I at Seleucia on the Tigris during a time of contest for sovereignty,62 had, by this time, become a somewhat standardized for- mula on the coinages of Upper Mesopotamia during times of stress when regal authority was in question. We might here recall the divine couple bronzes of Demetrius II, which may very well be from Nisibis, and which were issued during a time when the fate of the Graeco-Macedonian in- habitants of the eastern provinces was placed in jeopardy by the Parthian invasion. The bronze issues were meant for local circulation and their 59 WSM, p. 78, pl. 12, 12-14; CSE 905-6.

On this series of tetradrachms63 there are no monograms or control marks by which we might establish an internal chronology, therefore they are listed in a tentative chronological sequence based upon the apparent degree of maturity of the portrait (Plate 31). The profile and general characteristics of the portrait of die Al are so close to those on the bronzes of Plate 30, 14-18, that we can assume they belong to the same school of die cutters, if not the same hand. Furthermore, 63 Eight examples are known to the writer, five of which are from the Susiana hoard of 1965; see HLR (above, n. 17), 140-43, and Strauss 129.</page><page sequence="18">142 Wayne Moore the portrait of die A3 and that of Plate 30, 29, actually appears to have been engraved by the same hand.64 Given the very similar portrait style of the tetradrachms and the bronze issues of Series 2 and the fact that they carry the same fillet border on the obverse, it can be suggested that they were produced by the same mint. In the catalogue are listed three obverse and six reverse dies for the tetradrachms, which suggests a production period lasting from one to two years.65 This roughly parallels the estimated length of production for the divine couple bronzes, as noted above, and would serve to exclude Seleucia on the Tigris as a possible mint for the tetra- drachms, based upon the same arguments put forth for the bronze is- sues.66 The tetradrachm reverse presents the seated Apollo, a type appearing on the tetradrachms of Demetrius II only during his first reign.67 The first tetradrachm issues of Demetrius at Seleucia on the Tigris are of this type, in contrast to his later issues there with the seated Tyche type.68 We may see, in the use of the seated Apollo type on his inaugural issues, both at Antioch in the west and at Seleucia in the east, a precedent for another inaugural issue at Nisibis later in his first reign which perhaps celebrates not only his arrival at manhood with the slight beard, but also 64 Arthur Houghton, in a letter of 6 May 1984, concurs. 65 An estimate suggested by Arthur Houghton, in a letter of 27 March 1984. 66 See above, n. 57. Strauss, p. 130, correctly places the lightly bearded tetra- drachms of Demetrius II at the end of his first reign, but he considers this to be a brief period between 140 and 139 B.C. at Seleucia on the Tigris. The stylistic and technical similarities between the lightly bearded tetradrachms and the earlier types of Demetrius II at Seleucia, which he points out on pp. 119 and 129, may simply reflect an affinity of modus operandi between the mints of Seleucia and Nisibis. The mint of Nisibis, due to its geographical location, was known to have borrowed stylis- tic elements from both Antioch on the Orontes and Seleucia on the Tigris during previous reigns; WSM, pp. 67, 77 and 78. As a comparable issue, particular note should be made of the group of tetradrachms with a lightly bearded portrait of Se- leucus II, which have been assigned to Nisibis by Newell, WSM 818-23, pl. 8, 1-7, and p. 64, and which were associated with that king's Parthian campaign. 67 A type common on the issues of his western mints, particularly at Antioch on the Orontes upon the commencement of his first reign; Newell (above, n. 16), pl. 8. 68 HLR 114; Strauss 122 = CSE 1007.</page><page sequence="19">Demetrius II's Coinage at Nisibis 143 the reassertion of his legitimacy as the rightful heir to the Seleucid throne upon the commencement of his eastern expedition. Unlike the tetradrachms of Demetrius II at Seleucia on the Tigris (the later Tyche types always carry monograms), these lightly bearded issues are lacking control marks or monograms and display the epi- thet "Theou" (of god), which we do not find on any of the coinages of Demetrius at that mint. It seems evident that Demetrius dropped the epithet "Philadelphou" (of the brother lover), substituting instead the more forceful title of "Theou Nikatoros" (of the conquering god) on the tetradrachms of his only remaining eastern mint, Nisibis, during his Parthian campaign.69 In summary, it would appear that the lightly bearded tetradrachms and bronzes of Demetrius II form a cohesive and compact group of issues produced at a major provincial mint in the east during the latter part of his first reign. Historical and technical considerations as well as the volume of issue for both series would seem to exclude Seleucia on the Tigris as a possible mint, although certain iconographie and stylistic characteristics incorporated into the production of this group of issues seem to have been borrowed from Seleucia. Considering the Parthian occupation of the former Seleucid cities of Ecbatana, Susa, and Seleucia on the Tigris at this time, and the provenance of the bronzes, Nisibis - with its past history as a royal mint - would seem to be the only prob- able mint for this group of issues east of the Euphrates. 69 See Strauss, p. 130; see also Bikerman (above, n. 7).</page><page sequence="20">Plate 30 1 ^ 2 4 ^ 5 áĚk 12 13 It Ä À Divine Couple of Demetrius II</page><page sequence="21">Plate 31 D E ^ ^ À^^s&gt; ¿fffilRŽM^ ^Ě^1ÍMĚŽ^ Al-Pl A1-P2 A1-P3 A1-P4 Divine Couple of Demetrius II</page></plain_text>
