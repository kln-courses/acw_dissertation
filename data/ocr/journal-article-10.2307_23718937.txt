<plain_text><page sequence="1">Korean Spirituality, by Don Baker. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2008. 184 pp., illus., index. $45.00 cloth; $15.00 paper. In this useful book, Professor Don Baker provokes some good questions about Korean spirituality (and religions) and advances a thesis that is both stimulating and contestable. The "book provides a general overview of Korean spirituality"—fruit of Baker's "search for common themes across the wide spectrum of religious and spiritual beliefs and practices in Ko rean culture, past and present" (pp. 153, xiii). For Baker, "Spirituality can be defined as attitudes and actions grounded in the belief that there are invisible forces more powerful than we are, and that through interac tion with those forces we can better ourselves or make our lives more pleasant or meaningful... spirituality is broader than religiosity in that it can take place either within or outside a religious organization" (p. 5). He adds, "A defining characteristic of spirituality is a search for transcen dence, in the sense of transcending the limitations of normal human exis tence and normal human capabilities" (p. 7). This move may strike some as novel, since in the study of religions, Book Reviews 183</page><page sequence="2">the practice has been to subsume spirituality under religiosity (or reli gion), or to treat the two as synonymous. Indeed Baker's definition of spirituality overlaps quite a bit with the general definition of religion, like this one in the Oxford English Dictionary. "Recognition on the part of man of some higher unseen power as having control of destiny, and as being entitled to obedience, reverence, and worship; the general mental and moral attitude resulting from this belief, with reference to its effect upon the individual or the community, personal or general acceptance of this feeling as a standard spiritual and practical life." Consequently, given such overlap, even if the book was titled "Korean Religiosity (or Reli gion)," with the understanding that a person may be religious even if she doesn't belong to an organized religion, no great harm would have been done. What is truly novel, if not seminal, is Baker's presupposition that there is such a thing as Korean spirituality (religion). Korean religions have usu ally been studied as a constellation of distinct traditions—shamanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, New Religions, and the like. But the constellation itself has rarely, if ever, been regarded as having a reality of its own. Indeed, in his book Korea: A Religious History (revised edition, 2002), James Huntley Grayson rejects the materiality of such a constellation: "the author does not believe that there is such a 'thing' as Korean religion, but only Korean religions, or better, Korean religious traditions. Granted that there are certain cultural influences which give religion in Korea a different character from religion in China or Japan, none the less, the author does not think that taken as a whole there is a phenomenon which can be labeled as Korean religion" (p. 2). If Gray son is correct, Baker's thesis is a nonstarter. On the other hand, Baker may be on to something that Grayson has missed. The issue bears fur ther discussion. Further discussion is needed in part because if Korean spirituality does exist as an independent entity, Baker has not made a convincing case for it in this book. The author asserts, "spirituality in Korea is essen tially one manifestation of the universal human desire to transcend the limitation of individual human existence and overcoming suffering" (p. 10). He further states, "Korea in the twenty-first century is quite dif ferent from the Korea of only few decades ago, but its spiritual problem atic has remained fairly constant for two thousand years. Koreans tend to assume that human beings are essentially good. They also recognized that human beings often act in inappropriate ways. The long history of Korean spirituality is a history of attempts to resolve this contradiction" (p. 2). 184 Korean Studies VOLUME 32 I 2008</page><page sequence="3">Several concerns arise here. One is whether an encompassing entity such as Korean spirituality should pivot on a "problematic," a problematic that is ethical in dimension. How, for example, does this problematic op erate in a kut aimed at appeasing souls of fishermen who perished in a storm; in a ch'ulga where a man renounces his family to become a son monk; or in the proselytizing zeal of evangelical Protestants who seek to convert all Koreans to Christianity? Put differently, ethics is only one of several dimensions of spirituality (religion). Ninian Smart, in his World's Religions (second edition, 1998), counts seven dimensions of religion. Aside from the ethical, he also counts the ritual, social, mythical, doc trinal, experiential, and material. It stands to reason that a book like this should discuss how Korean spirituality is manifested in each of these dimensions, how such manifestation can be identified in the organized religions of Korea, and why such manifestation is distinct from the man ifestation of spirituality in, say, Japan. The book does not have such a discussion. A second concern is that the problematic the author adduces has a distinctly Confucian slant to it, giving one pause, in light of works of scholars such as Martina Deuchler ( The Confucian Transformation of Korea: A Study of Society and Ideology, 1992), who has shown that the Confucian transformation of Korea did not occur until the second half of the Chosón dynasty, around the seventeenth century. A third concern has to do with the Christians. As Baker acknowledges, nowadays Chris tians constitute nearly a third of the (South) Korean population. The Christians are latecomers to the Korean religious landscape, but their sig nificant presence is a problem for Baker's argument, since they do not subscribe to the view that human nature is essentially good. Yet another concern is this: what is Korean about the spiritual problematic the author lifts up? Surely non-Korean religionists (spiritualists) have also wrestled with their perception of the disconnect between what is and what should be; moreover, is it not the case that the Chinese also have viewed human nature to be essentially good? The book has some minor flaws as well, such as overmuch emphasis on the Pentecostal aspect of Korean Protestantism—almost caricaturing it at some points: for example, "In Christian [Protestant] churches, how ever, the pastor operates somewhat like a cheerleader. His congregation sings hymns loudly and joyfully, shouts out amens and hallelujahs, and raises its arms high to receive the Holy Spirit" (p. 135)—a scene one can scarcely imagine taking place in Somang Presbyterian Church, the digni fied evangelical church where President Lee Myung Bak is a member. Book Reviews 185</page><page sequence="4">Despite these drawbacks, the book is eminently worthwhile. In an in tellectual inquiry, good questions are just as important as good answers. And as can be seen from my discussion above, this book provokes ex cellent questions. That alone, in my opinion, pays for the price of the book. But the book has other attractions for seasoned students of Korean religions—not the least of which are concepts such as "anthropocen tricism," "anthropomorphism," and the "Spiritual Gaze in Korea" that Baker uses to carry on his analysis. In addition, the book will serve well as an introductory text to Korean religions, as it discusses all major reli gions of Korea, plus new ones such as Won Buddhism, Daesun Jinri hoe, and even Juche Ideology—all in a prose that is lucid and lively.
