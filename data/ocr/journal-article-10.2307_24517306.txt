<plain_text><page sequence="1">Organisms Julia Elliott When balmy summer days tilted toward unpleasant, and backyards transformed into jungles where supermosquitoes patrolled lush weeds, Jenny Hawkes liked to walk outside and stand in a margin of shade, listening to the collective hum of her neighborhood's HVAC units. She'd pretend that the Rapture had snatched all the idiots into outer space. She'd smoke a secret cigarette, a vice she hid even from her husband, and then hurry back into the air-conditioning. She worked as a guide for Sibyl, the online information company, answering the random questions of desperate people who were loath to do the research themselves. This morning there had been inquiries about Asian tiger mosquitoes, flood insurance, weight-loss nanobots, and Indian surrogates. Jenny already had websites with good an swers, so she punched them in quickly. And then, for the twentieth time that day, she checked the web for US fatalities in Afghanistan. It was one thirty and her son had not emerged from the den for lunch. Lately, as he spent more time before their wide-screen media monitor, he filled the den with his signature scent—the coppery tinge of stress pheromones in his sweat. Jenny did not like to step into this atmosphere, the musky, turbulent ambiance that envel oped his gangly body. Obscure glands pumped inside him. Hormones spiked his blood, ripened his genitals, covered secret places with hair, and fed the zits that festered on his sullen face. Adam was busy killing off brain cells with a video game, she fig ured, hunched before Zombie Babe Attack or some other disturbing concept dreamed up by marketing teams who dabbled in adolescent psychology and flirted with the darker urges. As much as she wanted to, Jenny didn't step down into the atmosphere and ask him if he wanted a sandwich. She went back to her office and dove into the sea of questions, braving the currents of the nation's fears. Activity on sibyl.com tended to surge after disappointing lunches left people list less at work. With the afternoon stretched out before them, they compulsively typed questions into the crystal ball featured on the site's main page. 306</page><page sequence="2">Julia Elliott They could no longer concentrate for extended periods of time. Their hair was falling out. Their homes suffered infestations of bed bugs, fleas, roaches, and ants. On the brink of financial disaster, they received threatening letters from creditors. They maxed out their credit cards, defaulted on their mortgages. Their homes were swept away by tornadoes, devoured by fires, flooded by hurricanes. They hid incurable toenail funguses within their fashionable shoes. They in jected their sagging flesh with botulinum toxin A. Cysts and tumors bloomed in the humid darkness of their wombs and testicles, in their brain and breast tissue, in their livers, gallbladders, bowels, and lungs. Their teeth were yellow. Their garbage disposals smelled of death. They had fat sucked out of their thighs and buttocks. They tracked their cheating lovers with spy software and burned off crow's-feet with laser beams. They were diabetic. They were ashamed of their old tattoos. They felt strange heart palpitations and were addicted to Internet pom. Their children suffered from autism and ADHD. Their lawns were turning brown. Fears of global warming and terrorist attacks and the collapse of the international economy kept them up at night. They thought that perhaps it was time to join a church, get some therapy, call a psychic, or visit a spa on the other side of the world where the ocean was the blue of an Aleve gelcap and the dollar was still worth something. By three thirty Jenny could no longer take it, so she slipped out for another smoke. She pictured her husband patrolling the desert in a tank. But she knew he was in an office building, staring at a computer screen, and that the sensitivity of his deployment did not allow him to send e-mails. On the way back to her office, she took a deep breath and knocked on the door of the den. No answer. Her son must have slumped upstairs to his room. But no: He was still there, hunched on the floor, a few inches from the 3-D HDTV. The knobs of his back bone protruded as though he were about to sprout iguana spines. She detected an unfamiliar smell akin to aerosol hair spray. Inhalant abuse was a hot topic on sibyl.com, and she wondered if he was huffing. "Adam," she said, feeling a chill when he refused to offer a grunt in response. The solar shades were drawn. She walked deeper into the atmosphere, into the light of the screen where the carpet was scattered with crushed Coke cans. "You ought to eat something besides junk for lunch." She had directed searchers to countless websites on how to get teens to talk, and there she was, at a loss. He was playing Zombie Babe Attack, a misogynist blood fest in which zombified Playboy 307</page><page sequence="3">Julia Elliott bunnies chased a male hero through a postapocalyptic city. His avatar slaughtered big-boobed zombies with a Browning machine gun mounted atop a convertible Corvette. The zombie babes wore thongs and heels. They had long, blonde hair. They exploded with cartoonish bursts of hot-pink gore. "Adam," she said, "you're sitting too close to the television." Lizard Man, a cinder-block dive near the railroad tracks, was named after the fabled local monster, an anthropomorphic reptile said to haunt swamps and sewers. The mural behind the bar featured a lizard in a top hat, nothing like the sludge-coated creature that more than a few citizens swore they'd seen lurking in the depths of their backyards or popping up from manholes on moon-white nights. The watering hole, with its oozing toilets and foggy fish tank, smelled like the kind of place reptilian and amphibious creatures might inhabit. Toad-shaped men and women slumped at the bar. And the bartender, covered in a spotted hide that had never known sun screen, seemed to possess a skink gene or two. The spray-painted windows blocked all light. It was an odd sensa tion to step horn sun-roasted asphalt into Lizard Man's smoky dark ness. Some people, entering the place in the daytime, were startled to see stars overhead upon stumbling out. Others arrived during the velvet of a summer dusk only to be blasted by the roaring furnace of the sun when they finally pulled themselves up from their stools and departed. On certain drunken nights, when the building seemed to pitch like a ship, time played tricks on customers like Miles Escrow, who swore he'd once surfaced from the strangely compressed air of the place to discover that three days had passed. But that didn't stop him from returning to Lizard Man whenever he'd had enough of Tina Flame, his common-law wife. Sitting with his back to the wall, his large ears twitched like a bat's as he strained to catch the latest. Tonight, folks were abuzz about a recently busted meth lab, from which a former pecan queen had fled, looking like a hag after enter ing the place as a dewy beauty of twenty-six. And word had it that the mayor was tangled up in a prostitution racket involving Slo vakian thugs and a tanning chain. A graduate of Fox Creek High would appear on American Idol. A Presbyterian preacher had pushed his wife into an industrial feed grinder. And in a stagnant inlet of Lake Wateree, a teen had been killed by a brain-eating amoeba. The patrons at Lizard Man were in disagreement about what, 308</page><page sequence="4">Julia Elliott exactly, an amoeba was. Tammy Hutto said she assumed it was a teeny fish, so small that it could swim up your nose and wriggle through your sinuses into your brain, whereupon it'd wind through the maze of your gray matter like a Pac-Man munching dots. Titus Redmond disagreed, opining that an amoeba was a plant, an algae like organism that spread via spores. Roddy Causey had the feeling an amoeba was a mass of little creatures, a swarm, though he had no idea what they looked like. At last, Stein cleared his throat. Though Stein seemed to know everything (his name was both an abbrevia tion of Einstein and a nod toward the pewter tankard from which he swilled), he liked to hold off, allowing the regulars to explore a subject before he descended from his Olympian mountain of omniscience to enlighten the ignorant drunkards below. He had two master's de grees and lived in a rusted Volkswagen bus. "An amoeba is a one-celled organism," he pronounced. "A proto zoan, to be exact." Like many of Stein's clarifications, this didn't do much to inform the revelers as to what an amoeba looked like or how it behaved. So, after having his tankard refilled with Heineken, Stein sketched a pic ture of an amoeba on his napkin and passed it around the bar. "It's just a blob," said Brandy Wellington. "I don't see how that could eat anybody's brain." "The brain-eating type has a little sucker that eats your cells," said Stein. "And then you come down with a fatal case of meningoencephalitis. " "I told my son not to go swimming this summer," said Wanda Bonnet. "He just needs to stay away from stagnant water," said Tlibs Watson. This brought them around to a discussion of teens and their follies, an inexhaustible subject for those assembled since most of them were either middle-aged parents or grandparents, and thus had first hand experience with the strange pupal state of the human life cycle, whereupon the organism transformed, almost overnight, from a sweet, well-behaved kid into a self-destructive, narcissistic goon, either monosyllabic or back-talking, a lurching zombie who ate up every morsel in the house and scattered filthy clothing all over the floor. Marty Bouknight said his son was a video-game junkie. Kim Dewlap said her daughter was a Twitter demon. Most everyone nodded in empathy, having lost a child to the cyber world at some recent point in time. Old Man Winger shook his head. He was an 309</page><page sequence="5">Julia Elliott ancient biker whose denim jacket had grown into his epidermis and whose tattoos had faded to ghostly shadows that looked like bruises on his withered arms. He had a very sad story to tell about his cousin's granddaughter Kayla. She was so into Facebook and Twitter and E-Live that she couldn't brush her teeth without tweeting. And just last week, her mother had found her in the living room, pressing her face against their plasma monitor as though trying to break through to the other side. The room was littered with so much junk food packaging that the poor child was practically buried in cello phane. And then she fell into a coma. "She ain't totally out but not exactly there either," said Winger. "What you think caused it?" asked Wanda Bonnet. "They don't know. They're testing for organ failure caused by her junk-food diet." Every parent of a teen child felt sick, but then relieved that this misfortune had happened to someone else. A few drunken mothers clutched their bosoms. But when Carla Marlin started bragging about her new swimming pool, the conversation shifted toward brighter subjects—like water skiing, catfish noodling, and time-share condos going cheap at Surf City. Beth Irving was a vegetarian, partially for health reasons, but mostly because her line of work made her hyperaware of the intricate life styles of infectious organisms. She couldn't look at a piece of meat without imagining it swarming with bacteria and one-celled organ isms, crawling with trichinosis roundworms or tapeworm larvae. Once again, she'd found herself in a godforsaken town with a malar ial climate and no health-food store, where the only decent place to eat was a strip-mall Thai joint that put too much sugar in its curry tofu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had stumbled upon another cluster of Toxoplasma heimeticus cases. And though Beth was thrilled to be on the research vanguard of what was quick ly becoming recognized as one of the weirdest behavior-modifying protozoan organisms to emerge since Toxoplasma gondii, she al ways got depressed in these backwater towns with dead Main Streets and flood zones packed with double-wides. Because Beth had grown up in a dying town in South Georgia, she always felt an uncanny sensation when cruising empty downtown streets or walking from pounding summer heat into the deep chill of a Piggly Wiggly. She feared she was getting sucked back into the 310</page><page sequence="6">Julia Elliott haunted swamplands of Clinch County, Georgia, locale of her birth. She saw a giant Venus flytrap swelling up from boggy land, opening its green jaws, and swallowing her. And now, with a few hours to kill before meeting the ED speciahst at Palmetto Baptist, she had no choice but to return to her room at Days Inn, where she succumbed to the narcotic allure of the television. Flipping through channels, she felt a panicky wash of pleasure as the borders of her identity began to dissolve. She remembered a film from Biology 629, a time-lapse sequence of a fox carcass devoured by necrophagous insects. The mammal shrank and then expanded with a moist infestation of writhing mag gots, which soon transformed into bluebottle flies that darted off to feed on wildflower nectar. Embracing the flux of disassociation might yield some exquisite Zen transcendence, she thought. Out of context, she felt her self diffusing. Her townhouse and boyfriend and collection of Scandinavian glass, her PhD and lucrative job with the CDC, her whole-foods organic vegetarian diet and Ashtanga yoga regime—all of it relegated to the realm of the theoretical, especially the boyfriend, who was eight years her junior, and whom she envi sioned, with a shiver of arousal, making love to some faceless female with wavering limbs. Of course, wholeness and bodily integrity were illusions. The body was a conceptually organized system of potentially chaotic processes and minute, volatile ecosystems. Beth thought of Cymothoa exigua, the enterprising sea louse that ate the tongue of its fish host and then masqueraded as that tongue, slurping up a portion of the spotted rose snapper's food while the oblivious fish went on with its business. The elegance of this poetic adaptation took her breath away. And then there were more obscure parasites, micromanagers of evolution that changed the surface of biological "reality" with their incessant, ingenious niche marketing. Caught up in intricate mechanisms, they hopped from one organ ism to another at different stages of their life cycles, migrating from intestines to lungs, hearts, or brains, sometimes reprogramming the behavior of their hosts. Such was the case with T. gondii, cousin of T. hermeticus, which made rodents act irrationally, drawing them toward the smell of cat urine, compelling them to flirt with disaster until they were devoured by felines who caught the bug and spread it through their droppings. Though T. gondii had evolved in a cat/rat system, it also in fected humans, who, as emerging research suggested, could undergo 311</page><page sequence="7">Julia Elliott personality changes—becoming more neurotic, more obsessive, and even stranger, enacting more traditional gender roles. Suffering slower reaction times, they became more accident-prone. They had trouble concentrating. Some infected males demonstrated a disregard for convention and indulged in risky behaviors. Scientists were even linking the bug to schizophrenia. Unlike the rat, the human host served no discernible purpose for the enterprising protozoan (unless he or she was devoured by a large cat). As far as researchers knew, Homo sapiens was an evolutionary dead end for T. gondii, which infected about 16.8 percent of the American population. But T. heimeticus was a different animal, a mutant variation of the T. gondii species. So far, only a dozen teenaged humans through out the US had tested positive in serologic tests for T. heimeticus antibodies. And though they seemed to be infected by the protozoan the usual ways (ingesting undercooked meat, contaminated soil, or cat dung), their responses to the infection were beginning to form a distinct pattern. Over the past two months, Beth had personally investigated ten cases in hot, humid regions of the United States, all of them ending in hospitalizations due to toxic-metabolic encephalo pathy coma. It was not clear whether this was the normal upshot of T. heimeticus infection, or whether these extreme cases were the only ones that had been medically documented. Each patient, between the ages of twelve and fourteen, was in the early stages of puberty. Sixty percent of them kept pet cats. According to family members, their comatose states had been pre ceded by an increasing obsession with video games, Internet pornog raphy, or social-networking sites—screen-addicted behaviors not uncommon among their demographic. This was accompanied by social withdrawal and changing feeding habits, an increasing distaste for sunlight and fresh foods, and a voracious appetite for junk food high in chemical additives—"chips, candies, and other knick knacks," as one distressed mother had put it. The parents of infected patients had been difficult for Beth to deal with, hailing, as they mostly did, from small southern towns and re minding her of her own parents with their bad diets, paranoid religious ideations, and right-wing political affiliations. In an hour she would talk to the DD speciahst. Over coffee in the hospital cafeteria, they would discuss strategies for persuading parents to let them conduct MRI scans that, while helping them understand more about the organ ism, would not necessarily lead to any breakthrough treatments. What Beth really needed was not a cartoon brain pulsing on a computer 312</page><page sequence="8">Julia Elliott screen, its amygdalae lit up with fluorescent red cysts. She itched to perform craniotomy biopsies, to suck tissue from the cysts, and ob serve the mysterious bradyzoites under an atomic-force microscope. When a Geico commercial came on, the one with the talking lizard, she shuddered, for she'd hated lizards ever since she'd stepped on one as a child. Feeling the crunch of its frail skeleton under her bare foot, she'd screamed as though burned. Now she punched the remote until she landed on the Weather Channel. She lay in bed for another minute, watching a Doppler-radar image of Hurricane Ana stasia sweep toward the Gulf Coast. Jenny stared out at a green wall of rain. The only place to smoke was the carport, and she felt exposed before the double-pane eyes of neigh boring ranch homes. No health-conscious middle-aged woman would, in her right mind, smoke cancer sticks. But her husband was 7,337 miles away, and there she was, sucking another one down as Ana stasia^ rain shields enveloped South Carolina in a sultry monsoon. As hurricane season geared up, there was a sense of foreboding on the Internet. Many sibyl.com seekers had inquired about global warm ing, wondering if Homo sapiens' unchecked ecological plundering was finally building up to a karmic bite in the ass. In the hinterlands of the Internet, on poorly designed websites with flashy fonts and bad grammar, the more hysterical demographics chattered about the Rapture, the reptilian elite, the return of space visitors who'd origi nally colonized planet Earth and planted the seed of consciousness in its indigenous hominids. Unable to sleep the previous night and clocking in on Sibyl to earn a few extra bucks, Jenny noticed, as she always did when working the wee hours, a delirious urgency in the questioning: Do Rh-negative people have reptile blood or do they descend from the Nephilim! I have twelve fibroids in my uterus and wander can I get pregnant1 My boy got an Aztec sun god tattoo is he mixed up with the Mexican Mafial So when she encountered her first question about T. hermeticus, she assumed it was another phantom from the shadowlands of insomnia. A girl I know said there was a bug that can get in your head and make you hooked to your computer screen. What is this thing1 313</page><page sequence="9">Julia Elliott Google searches yielded low-budget sci-fi movies and clusters of conspiracy sites, but then, nestled within the wing-nut comment boards and glib blogs of camp-cinema enthusiasts, was a PDF file on the Stanley Medical Research Institute site, an article describing the species variation and its relevance to T. gondii schizophrenia research. At the time of publication, only two cases of toxoplasmo sis via T. hermeticus had been documented, but the behavior of the two hospitalized teen hosts was similar: withdrawal from physical reality, computer and television screen addiction, the unbridled con sumption of junk food. And both teens had suffered comas resulting from toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Jenny's stomach lurched. Her heart beat faster. She did not run to the den where her son had camped with a pile of Xbox discs he'd swapped with friends. She walked purposefully and slowly, like a killer in a horror film, into the kitchen and down the steps. This time she didn't knock. She pushed the door open and stepped into the atmosphere. But her son was not there. A Screenshot from his paused video game showed his Dose avatar frozen in midfrenzy, clutching a pill bottle and spilling capsules as he struggled to get the right drug into his system. The game was sin ister and funny at once. The main character, suffering from a variety of behavioral, psychological, and physical issues, was constantly in danger of malfunctioning. He had to be kept on track with the right pharmaceuticals. The player could consult the electronic phar macopoeia built into the game, but of course the character quickly melted down, sank into unconsciousness, or became otherwise un stable, so a good working knowledge of contemporary medical drugs was required to play the game well. In this particular shot the char acter had become very thin, with bulging eyes and a comic goiter. "Adam," Jenny called, thinking he might be in the half bath. No answer, but at least he wasn't huddled close to the media screen. She did notice an obscene amount of discarded junk-food packaging littering the floor: chip bags and plastic cookie trays, flattened cartons and half-crushed cans. Walking deeper into the atmosphere, she felt heart palpitations and a shortening of breath. She picked up a Doritos bag and read the ingredients: MSG, at least three artificial colors, and a lengthy list of unwholesome compounds like disodium inosinate. "What are you doing?" The voice was mocking, croaky from its recent change. Her son stood just inside the open sliding-glass door, the insulated drapery jerked open, rain falling in the blurred green depths of the 314</page><page sequence="10">Julia Elliott backyard. She wondered if he'd been out there smoking something, huffing something, popping some newfangled multiple-use product of the medical-industrial complex. "Shut the door," she said. "The air conditioner's on." As he lurched toward her, she worried about his posture (was he developing curvature of the spine?), his teeth (would failure to pro vide braces lead to social ostracism and poor employment opportu nities?), his sexuality (would he catch an STD?), and, of course, his attention span (when was the last time he read a book?). The Internet was crawling with sexual predators. Teens were gobbling salvia, guz zling Robitussin, snorting Adderall. A gonorrhea superbug was devel oping resistance to antibiotics. "You need to pick up after yourself," she said. A fresh crop of pustules had erupted on his nose, which had recent ly grown too big for his face, though he still had the elfin features of boyhood. She could almost see him wrapping his arms around her legs. Could picture him riding on his father's shoulders. He was too big for these things now, of course. His greasy hair was brushed ab surdly forward, almost obscuring his eyes, which looked unnatural ly wet. "Right," he said. She couldn't tell if the word seethed with sarcasm or if it was a simple acknowledgment of the truth of her statement. "You need to eat a decent lunch. Fruits and vegetables. Whole grain bread." He rolled his eyes and grinned like a gargoyle. Yes, she thought, he had to have braces, which would cost at least $5,000. "What did you have for breakfast?" she said. "What is this Guantanamo Bay shit?" She felt somewhat relieved. He was still capable of creating analogies. "Watch the language and answer me." "Pop-Tarts and orange juice." He dropped to the floor, rolled onto his belly, and took up his deluxe controller. Good. Orange juice. She bought the USDA organic calcium plus vitamin D stuff from Publix. It contained no preservatives, colorants, or com syrup. Adam had had some just that morning, which meant that he had not developed intolerance to fruits and vegetables. And he was lolling at least three feet from the media screen, so he was probably safe—for now. 315</page><page sequence="11">Julia Elliott Miles Escrow could never tell if the world was turning to shit or if the patrons of Lizard Man tended to natter on about the darker ele ments of life. Now they were discussing accidents on Lake Wateree: jet-ski collisions and capsizing pontoons, drownings and disastrous ly executed water-ski stunts, exploding gas grills and feral campfires and murderous clouds of wasps. A renegade fishhook had gotten stuck in Wanda Bonnet's uncle's cheek and ripped a big gash. Marty Bouknight's cousin, pulling a hydrilla clump from the blades of his outboard motor, had lost three fingers. Kim Dewlap's preacher's step brother had snorkeled into a nest of water moccasins. And then there were the brain-eating amoebas, floating in stagnant water, waiting to be sucked up into the nasal passages of hapless swimmers. But that was old news. There was still just the one local case—the teen who'd died last month. Miles Escrow had come up with three possible explanations for the shit ton of recent lake-connected disasters: (1) The patrons were exaggerating; (2) Get any group together and they could generate an impressive list of mishaps associated with any particular place; and (3) The flooded reservoir that was Lake Wateree had once been the home of an ancient Indian burial ground, and hence was cursed. Miles Escrow preferred the drama of option 3. After drinking another Miller, he shared his proposition with the company. "I think I saw a movie about that," said Tammy Hutto. "There was a creature in the lake, an angry spirit or whatnot." "Every body of water has its cryptid," said Stein. "What the hell's that?" said Carla. "An imaginary creature that lives there, like the Lizard Man of Scape Ore Swamp." "My uncle saw the Lizard Man rooting through his garbage," said Brandy Wellington. Hereupon commenced a conversation that Miles Escrow had heard a thousand times in this particular bar. Everybody knew at least one person who had seen the Lizard Man, but not one of the patrons, it seemed, had spotted a glimmer of the fabled creature with his or her own naked eyes. It had been raining for a week and Miles had been arguing with Tina Flame, the same arguments they'd been slogging through for ten years: spats about his drinking, tiffs about her Internet shopping, and, even though they were almost forty, rows about whether or not they ought to have children. Fed by the weather, the arguments grew lush and green. Before they knew it, a thousand insults bloomed. Miles had had to get out of the house for a few 316</page><page sequence="12">Julia Elliott hours. Tonight, however, Lizard Man was boring him. But then the crowd turned to the topic of Winger's cousin's grand child Kayla, who was still out cold at Palmetto Baptist. Carla Marlin said she lived beside a phlebotomist who worked at the hospital, and she had some top-secret information she really ought not to share. Looking solemn, she made everybody promise they'd keep this ma terial hush-hush. And then, after ordering another daiquiri, rooting through her faux-snakeskin purse, and retrieving her Droid to check a text message, Carla cleared her throat and revealed that three teens were now laid up in comas at Palmetto Baptist. Not only that, but each patient had demonstrated the same peculiar symptoms as Winger's cousin's grandchild. Before losing consciousness, their obsessions with digital media had gotten way out of hand. They'd also eaten so much junk food that one of the first hypotheses as to the cause of their illness was food poisoning. But the doctors ruled that out, along with electric shock via media gadget. "What do they think it is then?" asked Titus Redmond. "My neighbor wouldn't say, but, judging by the look in his eye, it ain't pretty." Although Beth had been communicating for months with big shots on the cutting edge of T. gondii research—mostly male evolutionary biologists, parasitologists, and neurobiologists—the word was just getting out on T. heimeticus, and she feared she'd be muscled out of the game. As she awaited the arrival of a certain eminent neuro virologist from Johns Hopkins, she demonstrated behaviors that psy chologists had placed on the lower end of the obsessive-compulsive disorder spectrum: nail biting, cuticle picking, napkin tearing. In the air-conditioned depths of Pink Lotus, she sipped iced water and stud ied her laptop screen. An MRI scan of an infected teen brain glowed before her. The fluorescent red cysts conglomerated mostly in the pleasure and fear centers. Just like schizophrenics suffering from T. gondii toxoplasmosis, infected patients were producing elevated levels of dopamine. And Beth had a theory that made her heart race. Like T. gondii, the heimeticus species had genes that allowed it not only to jack up dopamine production, but also to create optimal conditions that depended on an intricate blend of its host's onset-puberty hormones, specific chemical food additives in the blood, and the heady neuro chemical combinations produced by video-game play, intense social 317</page><page sequence="13">Julia Elliott networking, and Internet porn use. She didn't know if the particular brain cocktail improved conditions for the dormant bradyzoites, or if the tweaked behavior of the teens was a form of parasite-induced "mind control" recently perfected to land the protozoan's intended rodent host in the jaws of a cat. Once again, she navigated the twists and turns of her theory, puz zling out the evolutionary logic of the adaptation, but became flus tered when she noticed Dr. Bloom hovering over her with a bemused expression on his acne-scarred face. He was somewhat handsome, early forties, with a skin condition that had probably pushed him into nerdy seclusion as an adolescent, forming the foundation of his brilliant career in the hard sciences. His eyes were almost obscenely beautiful. She could see him as a teen, green orbs glowing upon his zit-corroded face as though miraculously escaping infection. "Dr. Irving, I presume." He lifted a sparse eyebrow. Beth knew that she looked young for her age. Tom between reveal ing her true age to enhance her authority and concealing it to en hance her sexual attraction, she chose the latter. "Dr. Bloom. Sorry we're having supper in a strip mall, but this is the best I could do in this savage land." "Supper," he said. "You must be southern." "I grew up in Argyle, Georgia." "So you immersed yourself in academia to escape a life of drudgery at the sock factory there?" Beth tittered. Dr. Bloom sat down. They ordered Singha beers. As a joke they continued to call each other by their professional titles, even when swept into a passionate discussion about parasitic mind control. Dr. Bloom asked her if she had tested her male pa tients' responses to cat urine, and she tactfully reminded him that the infected teens were in comatose states, surrounded by bereaved relatives. Drawing a lock of hair to her mouth and taking a compul sive nibble, she asked him if it was true that males infected with T. gondii had higher testosterone levels and were hence more attrac tive to women. "What do you think?" He flexed his right bicep and smirked. "What?" Beth smiled. "Did you test positive?" "Actually," he said, "I don't know,- I've never been tested. Have you?" "No. Maybe I should be." She examined his clothing: a plaid shirt, rumpled, but not demon strating a lack of concern with personal grooming. His gray-streaked 318</page><page sequence="14">Julia Elliott hair was tousled but clean. Beth blushed and changed the subject to another organism. "I heard you did a postdoc with Polysphincta gutfreundi." Gesticulating expressively, opening his mouth to reveal half masticated meat, Dr. Bloom held forth on the parasitic wasp larva that, after hatching in the body of the orb spider, released chemicals that made its host weave a custom cocoon for it. The spider essen tially became a zombie that did the worm's bidding. Lit from within by his third beer and his zeal for parasitic organ isms, Dr. Bloom began to look strangely attractive. She remembered an article she'd read about the flu virus, which argued that infected humans became more social than usual, optimizing the virus's chance of spreading. She thought of her boyfriend, a beautiful, frivo lous creature, knowing that she'd allow their relationship to grow like an extravagant mushroom that would, one hot summer day, suddenly lapse into slime. Whenever Jenny found herself in front of her computer screen, she could not stop searching for more information on T. hermeticus, which flared occasionally in the outer reaches of cyberspace like gamma-ray bursts. Her talent for obscure searches had led to the discovery that at least two dozen teens had been infected nationally, six of whom were now in comatose states at Palmetto Baptist. She'd ferreted out this last bit on a local church prayer board: Please pray for Sheila Freeman's son who is in a coma and the other five teens who struggle in darkness with him. In Jesus name. Although the poster did not mention T. hermeticus or even verify the hospital, Jenny felt sure that the prayer giver was referring to the new freak parasite. The local infection had also made an appearance on her son's Facebook stream. That morning, he'd left his iPhone on the kitchen table, and though she felt guilty examining his page, she rationalized that her snooping was for his own good. A girl named Kaitlin Moore had posted the following status update two days ago at 1:36 a.m.: Please send good vibes to my cousin Ashley who is in a coma at the hospital her mom found her passed out in front of the TV. So weird. In the ninety-two comments that followed, condolences and positive energy flows abounded, but halfway through, rumors and specula tion took over. Jenny learned of three similar cases (friends of friends 319</page><page sequence="15">Julia Elliott of posters), in which the hapless hosts had fallen into unconscious ness after especially intense gaming bouts, Twitter marathons, or Internet porn Odysseys. When a boy named Brandon Booth opined that the sufferers were victims of a virus originating from alien life forms, several teens pounced on him, telling him to "get a grasp dork" because this was "not a sci-fi flick but the real fucking world." Brandon was not the only one who suspected alien shenanigans. Out in cyber la-la land, wild theories flourished. People with user names like Phoenix66, upon hearing about the parasite, conjectured that the original space colonists had returned to Earth to help hu mans evolve to the next level. Later that day, Jenny stumbled upon an antigovernment site attesting that T. heimeticus had been de signed by the US military in conjunction with Middle Eastern elites to terrorize the US population into docile sheep. Though she chuck led to herself at these paranoid assertions, she often emerged from her web-surfing stupor with a sense of wonder. "What if?" she'd think as she enjoyed a cigarette, staring out at the riotous jungle that was overtaking their backyard. But the mystique would fade in the fluorescent light of the kitchen as she opened a can of tuna. Although she didn't believe that the parasite had been bioengi neered by aliens or the US government or al-Qaeda, she was, of course, terrified that it would infect her son. Though she'd sat him down in the matter-of-fact brightness of the kitchen and asked him if he'd heard about the comatose teens (he'd scanned Kaitlin Moore's Facebook status), though she'd explained the presumed causes of T. heimeticus transmission, though she had gone over the symptoms and warned him about the correlation between excessive screen time and junk-food consumption and full-blown toxoplasmosis, she still felt the relentless throb of fear behind her breastbone every sec ond of every waking hour. And her husband was out in the desert doing God knows what. She envisioned him standing on a pink dune, staring into a hazy void specked with an occasional camel. Did they even have camels in Afghanistan? She couldn't remember. She would Google it when she settled back into her swivel chair. "If I understand you," said Adam, "then the screen time and junk food are not causes of the coma but symptoms of the disease." Was he looking at her with pity as though she had lost it? "I'm not sure." She forced her mouth into a smile that she hoped radiated adult wisdom. "But I think that's about right." "So it doesn't really matter what I do." He grinned and slunk to ward the dark den. 320</page><page sequence="16">Julia Elliott That night Jenny woke up sweating, shaking off a nightmare in which her husband had transformed into some kind of desert scorpion cyborg, and her son, after falling into a coma, had pupated into a winged creatine that moved so fast she couldn't catch a glimpse of his face. Miles Escrow had the eerie feeling that he'd experienced it all before: the whine of the jukebox, water stains on the ceiling, Wanda Bonnet blowing her nose into a sodden tissue after another weeping bout. She was the only mother of an infected teen who'd shown up at Lizard Man that night. Ten minutes and two shots of vodka later, she was gone, driving through rain back to the hospital. She'd come, he figured, thinking her old haunt might soothe her, but she must've felt alienated after all, judging by the startled-doe look on her face. Those patrons whose kids weren't infected were probably at home, domestic surveillance in overdrive. DHEC had finally issued a state ment verifying the number of infected teens in the state (forty-two), explaining the life cycle of T. heimeticus, and urging people not to panic as medical authorities were doing all they could to understand the bug, including setting up testing facilities that would soon be available to the general population. Although the sick kids were comatose, their comas were relatively high on the Glasgow scale, and there was no reason to believe they wouldn't snap out of it soon. Tonight it was just Miles, Stein, Old Man Winger, and of course Rufus Pope, the bottom-heavy mixologist who lurched like Godzilla behind the bar. But then Carla Marlin showed up with some startling news. When she barged into the bar, eyes on fire from her recent revelation, she seemed disappointed that her grand announcement would be received by only four men, one of them (Miles dared to think) a decent catch, albeit securely snatched up in the Tabasco-red talons of Tina Flame. Or was he? Miles gave Carla the head-to-toe and found her paling in comparison to his ten-year live-in. A sun worshipper with freckled, tawny skin and hair bleached white as polar-bear fleece, she failed to tickle his fancy. That didn't stop him from draping a soothing arm over her back as she drew out her prologue to the big announcement, punching code into her Droid, lighting a Winston, and licking a drop of nectar from her pina colada straw before clearing her throat. But when Roddy Causey cruised into the bar, she withheld the goods again, waiting for him to secure a Budweiser before she wasted her 321</page><page sequence="17">fulia Elliott breath on three old men and the flunky of Tina Flame. "My neighbor the phlebotomist just got off his weird shift. Said all hell had broke loose down at Palmetto Baptist." Carla Marlin blew six perfect smoke rings. "Enough with the rising action," said Stein. "Let's have our climax now." Carla raised her eyebrows at the word climax. "Well, if you got to know right this second: One of the teenagers is missing. They don't know if he just jumped out of bed and walked out, or if it was a kidnapping kind of thing." "Or maybe he got beamed to another dimension," said Stein. "Yeah." Carla rolled her eyes. "There's always that." "They'll find him," said Roddy Causey. "Bet he woke up with am nesia and got lost." "A common soap-opera trope," said Stein. "The whole waking-up from-a-coma-with-amnesia shtick. " "Like Anastasia in Purple Passions," said Carla. "It's actually called a 'convenient coma,'" said Stein. Carla Marlin mustered her coldest drop-dead stare. "There's nothing convenient about it," she said. Beth Irving held a plastic vial of cat piss and repressed another gag. She'd been drinking ginger tea and popping B-6, pressing the acu puncture points reputed to diminish nausea. Still, a rank, yellow fume actually spilled from the vial like the cartoon hieroglyphics that flowed from the tail of Pepé Le Pew. But she would prevail because she had to, because other specialists in other states were testing their own comatose teens and compiling data, because one of her test sub jects had mysteriously disappeared like a patient in a slasher film, and a certain famous neurologist was flying in from Germany. This time, she promised herself with a dark chuckle, she would refrain from sleeping with him. The fact that he was portly and bald (she'd checked out his web profile) would help. Though she knew she was pregnant, she didn't have time to deal with it—emotionally or physically. The nausea, however, made it difficult to repress the fact that a new life was incubating inside her. Every time a green wave of sickness rocked through her, she couldn't help but envision the 8-cell zygote glistening in the void of her uterus. The small cluster of dividing cells was already sending chem ical messages into her blood and nervous system, directing her eating 322</page><page sequence="18">Julia Elliott habits to suit its needs, lording it over her bladder and producing "emotions" advantageous to its own survival. Her rationality had been hijacked weeks ago, when Dr. Bloom breezed into town at the height of her ovulatory cycle, her exquisitely receptive system going into overdrive upon detecting the neurovirologist's sweet pheromones. Had she pounced upon him like a starved jaguar in the fake cherry-scented darkness of her hotel room? Had she still had enough emotional detachment to quip about their feral passion as Dr. Bloom struggled drunkenly with her belt buckle? Yes, and, thank goodness, yes. But she'd also been prompted by a deep urge to sabotage her cur rent relationship. Now she was exhausted. As she went about her work, renegade factions of her brain urged her to slink into an unoccupied room and take a nap, or flee the bombardment of horrific hospital odors, rush through the automatic doors of entrance C, and take deep breaths in the oasis of landscaping where gardenias bloomed. But she had final ly gotten three clearances for MRIs from desperate parents. And just yesterday one of the patients had possibly come out of his coma, though now the staff at this backwoods facility couldn't seem to find him. She had to work quickly in case the others woke up. She wanted to test olfactory responses to cat urine and the effects of antipsy chotics on dopamine levels. Struggling to keep her mind focused on her research tasks, she kept getting swept away by waves of nausea and stray images of Dr. Bloom. She saw him gnawing gristle from a chicken bone. Saw him hovering over her, wolfman eyes aglow. Saw him scurry into the bathroom where he displayed his buttocks with mock coyness be fore gruffly closing the door. He'd flown to Nashville to look into a recent case there, asking her, with a wistful smile, if she might join him later to diversify her research. They could visit all the infection sites, he romantically suggested. But no. The T. hermeticus epidemic was most pronounced in this particular town, and Beth was trying to figure out how the hurricane weather and blighted economic conditions factored into this phe nomenon. Remembering her own coming of age in South Georgia, she thought that clinical depression might play a role. And she needed to find teens testing positive who had not reached the comatose state, which wasn't necessarily the upshot of infection. Just as most T. gondii-positive people failed to show marked personality changes, and so-called schizophrenics probably had a predisposition that 323</page><page sequence="19">Julia Elliott heightened the parasite's effects, some T. hermeticus hosts might not be susceptible to full-blown toxoplasmosis. Beth hypothesized that perhaps the hospitalized teens were particularly susceptible due to depression or malnutrition or other immune-weakening factors. But she couldn't test this without getting her hands on some non pathological positives, which required slogging through labyrinthine DHEC paperwork, which required mental acuity and a nausea-free system, all of which were eluding her now, especially after she poured cat urine into the TDR diffuser and could not escape its musky insinuations no matter how many times she changed her latex gloves. According to Adam's Facebook stream, Todd Spencer, the comatose teen who had mysteriously disappeared from the hospital, had made several shadowy appearances around town, materializing at the mar gins of various events before vanishing again. Heather Remington had spotted him lurking under the bleachers at a softball game. Josh Williams thought he might've seen him skulking down a hallway of First Baptist's new recreation facility. And several kids swore they'd seen him emerge from the woods and stand at the moonlit edge of Bob Bickle's pond, where an illicit teen party was in full riot. Following DHEC's recommendations, Jenny had confiscated Adam's iPhone, equipping him with an old-fashioned flip phone until the crisis had passed. Though she knew she was violating his privacy by perusing his Facebook account, she felt that desperate times called for desperate measures, even though her son had not tested positive for T. gondii or T. hermeticus antigens. Two days before, she'd driven him to a Walmart where free testing facilities had been set up by DHEC. At least two dozen teens had waited on the scorched blacktop with their parents, the smell of sunscreen floating in the muggy air. Hurricane Anastasia had dissipated, and now a heat wave had settled in, with temperatures capping at 110. People were living like moles, hurrying from one air-conditioned bunker to another, compulsively checking their media gadgets for the latest on T. hermeticus. The bug was mostly affecting the southern states, possibly because its weather conditions encouraged the species to thrive. Jenny was very busy with sibyl.com, though she pulled herself away from her screen every half hour to check on Adam, making sure he hadn't found the power cord to their media screen (which she'd stuffed into 324</page><page sequence="20">Julia Elliott a corner of their china cabinet). So far he'd spent the morning sprawled on his bed, perusing old comics. He'd actually called her in to check out a particular issue from the bygone era of 2009. If weather conditions had permitted, she would've suggested some whimsical outing—a picnic, a sporting event. But she did what she could to protect him. She'd stocked up on healthy snacks. She'd ordered educational board games for them to play together. She tracked her packages on UPS.com, hoping that when they arrived, a golden age of mother-son bonding would flourish. Around eleven she started thinking about lunch, deciding to drop by Adam's room to ask what kind of wholesome entrée he fancied. But he wasn't in his room. Of course she felt the familiar throbbing of her heart as she moved toward the bathroom, calling his name with ostentatious nonchalance. He was not in the bathroom. He was not in the den. He was not hiding out in the master bedroom, which, up until last winter, she'd shared with her husband. When she opened the door to the laundry room, she saw him hunched before their fat, old Magnavox, plying the vintage joystick of her husband's childhood Atari. Her husband, desperate for bonding after returning from a deployment a year ago, had attempted to interest their son in this outfit. "What are you doing?" she said. Adam released a long, slow breath and fixed her with a defiant grin. "Caught red-handed." He tossed the joystick onto the floor, where it bounced unexpectedly. "I'm going out of my mind with boredom, and I can't even check my e-mail on that archaic piece of shit you gave me." "Watch the language." As he stared at the primitive graphics of Asteroids, light from the screen reflected in his irises, which gave him the dead, mechanical gaze of a shark. Miles Escrow could not remember days this hot. As he listened to Stein go on about how the dinosaurs died out, he wondered if humans were reaching the limits of this particular evolutionary stage. Regarding Titus Redmond, a vinyl siding-installation special ist with a swollen gut, Miles thought, Here we have the height of human evolution, Homo sapiens, which, as Stein had informed him on numerous occasions, meant "wise man." If there was such a 325</page><page sequence="21">Julia Elliott thing as the Lizard Man of Scape Ore Swamp, Miles theorized, maybe he'd survive the sweltering climate that was becoming the norm around here, making it well-nigh impossible to enjoy the great outdoors with its supermosquitoes and poisonous UV rays. So he chose to spend his Saturday afternoon hunkered in the smoked chill of Lizard Man, wondering if he'd ever shake free of Tina Flame. Though he suspected they'd bicker their way into a double-plot grave at Sunset Memory Gardens, he liked to fool himself with little escapades at Lizard Man—dalliances with single mothers and women estranged from their no-count men. On this summer afternoon, with a heat index of 120, he'd zeroed in on Brandy Wellington, who was in better spirits of late as her comatose cousin had shown signs of con sciousness up at Palmetto Baptist. "He looked right into his mama's eyes," said Brandy. "Asked her for a Coke and then zoned out again." "He can use the imperative voice logically," said Stein, "a good sign." Brandy rolled her eyes and smirked at Miles. "And that boy who's gone missing," she said. "Todd Spencer. I heard his mama found evidence that he'd been in his bedroom—a few drawers left open; some of his stuff missing." "What makes her so sure it's him?" said Stein. "She said a mother could just tell." Brandy Wellington blew an irate huff of smoke and examined her ebony fingernails, nails that matched her Elvira hair and black-widow ankle tattoo. "No empirical evidence there," said Stein, whereupon Miles and Brandy enjoyed a sweet, conspiratorial eye roll together, solving Miles's dilemma over whether or not he ought to indulge in adult beverage number four. Beth couldn't help but feel a little spooked in the makeshift teen coma ward, where a whole section of hospital had been corralled off to accommodate the rising number of cases. She'd been cleared for antipsychotic drug tests on five of the patients, and she was making her midnight rounds, checking their encéphalographie data for signs of neurological change. Pausing to drink in the Pre-Raphaelite love liness of a red-haired boy she called Sleeping Beauty, Beth waited for him to open his eyes as he sometimes did in the wee hours. The sudden jolt of green always startled her. He would stare at her for a few seconds before his flushed, pink eyelids slid back over the most 326</page><page sequence="22">Julia Elliott spectacular set of ocular organs she'd ever seen. He was an ethereal one, destined to bolt this shit town if he ever roused from his strange sleep, as had happened a total of three times nationally (which included the case of Todd Spencer). Even spookier, all three teens had vanished before resurfacing elusively at various events, sending their respective towns into a delirium of tabloid speculation. As Beth gazed down at Sleeping Beauty, she wondered if it was true that hormonal changes caused pregnant women to be attracted to dif ferent kinds of men: unthreatening creatures with brotherly phero mones and kindred genetic codes. Beth Irving had no brothers, no sisters, only two stern, religious parents who had prompted a pre dictable rebellion that had been nipped in the bud by an abortion and a full scholarship to Duke. Though the organism that now brewed within her had recently advanced from zygotic to embryonic status, she had not allowed her self to make any decisions about its destiny, vowing to finish her research first. Once home amidst the placid decor of her townhouse, its birch cabinets packed with stress-reducing organic teas, she'd make the hard decisions. Of course she couldn't ignore the creature inside her, which imbued every cell in her body with nausea and made smells almost psychedelic. The aroma that rose from Sleeping Beauty, for instance, was a strange blend of hospital-grade disinfec tant and some sweet, woodsy musk. All the comatose teens had strange breath—a pond funk with some elusive chemical component redolent of car exhaust. But the B-6 pills were making the situation bearable. She stood beside Sleeping Beauty for another minute and then moved on to the next room, which housed two girls, one of whom had been approved for antipsychotics. While adjusting Tamika Ham mond's EEG electrodes, she caught a glimmer of movement out in the corridor. Upon rushing into the hall, she saw a tall, slender fig ure in a pale hospital gown, hovering a few inches above the polished vinyl floor. Rubbing her eyes and looking again, she saw nothing. Even though she had been sleeping poorly and had suffered several incidents of blotchy vision, even though she knew that security was on red alert due to the disappearance of Todd Spencer, she followed the figment into the snack room where she detected a presence. There was only one other door leading out of the snack room, back behind the nurse's station (which appeared to have been abandoned), and into corridor B. 327</page><page sequence="23">Julia Elliott Although this corridor required the swipe of a security card, the doors were propped open, an industrial cleaning cart parked nearby. In a corner, behind several wheeled shelves piled with broken com puter equipment, a hospital janitor crouched. The janitor stood up and clutched at her neckline. "Mieida," she said. "You scared me." "What are you doing back there?" Beth had to ask. "Rat," she said. "Can you believe it?" "They must take the elevator from the east wing cafeteria," Beth joked. "Did you see anybody walking through here?" The janitor shook her head. Beth moved out into the hall, where elevators led down to the main wing that featured the hospital's gift and coffee shops. Now she understood how Todd Spencer had made his escape, assuming that he'd not spontaneously combusted. And then she saw the figure again—tall, elegant, his shaggy red hair longer than it had looked when he was lying in repose like a creature trapped in a fairy-tale curse. Sleeping Beauty paused before strolling through the automatic doors. Of course the security guard was not at his desk, and Beth had no time to look for him. She jogged toward the door and ran out into the humming summer night. In her favorite patch of landscaping, where gardenias unleashed their wistful perfume and floodlights cast the Eli Lilly Memorial Bench in a spectral glow, the boy stood barefoot in his pagan gown. He stared up at the sky, as though searching for the moon. And then, after glancing back at Beth and treating her to a smile that did strange things to her blood chemistry, he ran over a green hillock and down toward the flowing highway. 328</page></plain_text>
