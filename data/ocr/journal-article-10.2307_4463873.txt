We studied a cohort of young children with cryptosporidiosis to determine whether sys- temic inflammatory responses occur and, if so, to evaluate whether inflammation persists after infection. Cryptospori- diosis was associated with increased levels of interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-a systemically, which persisted at 6 months after enrollment. The level of intestinal tumor necrosis factor-a was elevated at enrollment, but elevated levels did not persist. Worsening of malnutrition, particularly stunting, was observed after infection. The association of cryptosporidiosis, inflammation, and stunting in children with cryptosporidiosis warrants further evaluation. Very young children and individuals with immunodeficiencies are at the highest risk of protracted diarrhea and morbidity due to cryptosporidiosis [1-3]. In particular, children with cryptosporidiosis have an increased incidence of linear growth loss (stunting), as well as cognitive and physical developmental delays [4, 5]. Cryptosporidiosis prompts an inflammatory re- sponse at mucosal surfaces, which includes the proinflamma- tory cytokines TNF-at and IL-8 [6, 7]. We studied a cohort of young children to determine whether systemic markers of in- flammation could also be demonstrated in children with cryp- Received 10 February 2006; accepted 23 May 2006; electronically published 26 July 2006.

We performed a prospective cohort study at Les Centres Groupe Haiten d' Etude du Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO; Port-au-Prince, Haiti). Two groups of children &lt;36 months of age were enrolled; case patients were children with diarrhea and stool examination findings positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts. Healthy control subjects were asymptomatic children with no known medical problems who had been without diarrhea for at least 4 weeks before enrollment and who had negative findings of a stool examination for Cryptosporidium. Epidemiological, clinical, and anthropomorphic data were collected at study enrollment and at 6 and 9 months after study enrollment. Children with diarrhea were treated according to the clinical degree of dehydration [8]. Follow-up care was per- formed until diarrhea resolved and as needed. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Vermont College of Medicine (Burlington) and by the Comite D'ethique Du GHESKIO. Diarrhea &lt; 14 days in duration was considered to be "acute." Diarrhea of 15-29 days in duration was defined as "persistent," and diarrhea '30 days in duration was defined as "chronic." A diarrheal episode was defined as at least 3 loose stools within a 24-h period. Clinical definitions of dehydration were used, as reported elsewhere [8]. Weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for- height Z scores were calculated using nutritional software (Epilnfo software, version 6.0; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Children were defined as being stunted, being wasted, or having general malnutrition if the height-for-age Z score, weight-for-height Z score, or weight-for-age Z score, re- spectively, was &lt;2 SDs below the population mean [9]. A total of 2-5 mL of peripheral blood from each child was obtained and placed into plain, EDTA-coated, and heparinized (trace-metal free) vacutainer tubes at enrollment and at follow- up visits. A complete blood count with differential cell count, a CD4+ cell count, an HIV ELISA, and measurement of zinc were performed in the clinical laboratories of Centres GHES- KIO (Port-au-Prince, Haiti) and Fletcher Allen Health Care (Burlington, Vermont). Vitamin A (serum retinol) specimens were processed in the laboratory of Dr. W. S. Blaner at Co- lumbia University (New York, New York), as described else- where [10, 11].

Infection due to Cryp- tosporidium species was diagnosed if Ziehl-Nielsen modified acid-fast stain revealed pink-staining oocysts 4-6 l/m in di- ameter that were seen by 2 independent reviewers. For peripheral blood cytokines, freshly isolated PBMCs from 3-5-mL samples of whole blood (yield, 1-2.5 X 106 PBMCs/ mL) were plated at 1 X 106 cells/mL on 24-well plates in trip- licate. Negative control wells received no additional stimulant, positive control wells received the mitogen phytohemmaglu- tinin (PHA) at 5 ug/mL, and antigen wells received Crypto- sporidium antigen suspension at 10 ug/mL, as described else- where [13, 14]. Cryptosporidium antigen suspension was prepared by ultrasonification of oocysts, as described elsewhere [15]. PBMCs were incubated at 37?C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h for PHA wells and for 7 days for control and antigen wells. Cell supernatants were diluted in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Undiluted or diluted supernatants were analyzed for human IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IFN--y, and TNF-ca receptor 1 by ELISA, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Quantikine ELISA kits; R&amp;D Systems). All samples from each individual were tested in parallel. For fecal cytokines, cytokines in the supernatants of stool aliquots were measured, as described elsewhere [7]. Data were analyzed with SAS software, version 8.0 (SAS). Statistical significance of normally distributed variables was as- sessed by x2 test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. The Kruskal- Wallis test was used for nonparametric variables. Baseline values were subtracted from poststimulation values to yield final re- sults. Statistical significance was defined as a P value -.05, determined using a 2-tailed test. Results. A total of 42 children with cryptosporidiosis (case patients) and 31 children without current medical problems or diarrhea (control subjects) were enrolled in the study after in- formed consent was obtained. A total of 38 case patients and 25 control subjects returned 6-9 months after enrollment for a minimum of 2 follow-up visits. Demographic data for age and sex were similar between groups (table 1). Most children received some breastfeeding, but the duration of exclusive breastfeeding (defined as no other oral intake) was short for both groups (mean duration, 2.4 months for case patients vs. 3.1 months for control subjects). The majority of children with cryptosporidiosis presented for evaluation with acute (41.1%) or persistent (43.8%) diarrhea a mean of 13.9 days after the onset of diarrhea, and the overall mean duration of cryptos- poridial diarrhea was protracted (17.9 days). Although 90% of case patients received oral rehydration solution before presen- tation, 12 (31.6%) had moderate or severe dehydration. Only data from children who completed follow-up visits at 0, 6, and 9 months after study enrollment were used for nu- tritional analysis. Case patients were more malnourished than control subjects at enrollment with respect to wasting (P = .02) and general malnutrition (P = .011). Case patients were significantly more stunted than control subjects at 6 months after enrollment (P = .031) and 9 months after enrollment (P&lt; .001). General malnutrition was persistently worse among case patients than among control subjects at the 6-month and 9-month follow-up visits (P = .004 and P = .01, respectively). In contrast, wasting found at enrollment (P = .02) stabilized or improved among case patients at the 6-month visit (P = .15) and did not differ from that found among from control subjects at the 9-month visit (P = .58). Within the control subject group, no statistically significant change in malnutrition was demonstrated during the same time period. Laboratory data were similar between groups (data not shown). No statistically significant differences were found at any time point for measurements of WBC count, CD4+ cell count, HIV antibody test results, hematocrit, MCV, and bac- terial copathogens. Platelet counts were significantly lower for case patients but only at the 9-month visit (P = .024). Case patients had significantly more instances of moderate or severe vitamin A deficiency (&lt;20 /,g/mL) than control subjects at both enrollment (P = .028) and the 9-month follow-up visit (P = BRIEF REPORT * CID 2006:43 (1 September) * 605</page><page sequence="3">Table 2.

The number of parasite copathogens was higher among case patients at 9 months after enrollment (P = .06), partic- ularly for Giardia lamblia (P = .026). Two cases of infection due to nontyphi Salmonella species were also detected in case patients. Among case patients, 17 (51.2%) of 33 enrollment samples were positive for fecal lactoferrin, whereas only 1 of 25 control subjects had samples that were positive for fecal lactoferrin (P&lt;.001). Moderate or severe vitamin A deficiency was found in 28 (87.5%) of 32 case patients and 15 (60%) of 25 control subjects at enrollment (P = .028) and persisted at 9 months (P = .045). ELISAs for PBMC supernatant cytokines demonstrated that, in response to nonspecific (PHA) and specific (Cryptosporidium sonicate) antigens, children with cryptosporidiosis had in- creased systemic cytokine production, compared with control subjects; some differences reached statistical significance. IL-8 production by case patients was significantly increased, com- pared with production by control subjects, at enrollment (PHA) and at 6 months (Cryptosporidium sonicate and PHA). TNF- a production was also significantly increased to both antigens at 6 months for case patients, compared with control subjects. IFN-y production, although higher among case patients, did not reach statistical significance (table 2). No differences be- tween case patients and control subjects were found for IL-4 or IL-10 (data not shown). Measurement of fecal cytokines demonstrated a significant increase in TNF-a at enrollment in case patients, compared with control subjects, that did not persist at 6 or 9 months (table 2). Of note, control subjects had statistically higher fecal IFN-y levels at 6 and 9 months after enrollment. No fecal cytokine differences in IL-8, IL-4, tumor growth factor-$, or IL-10 were noted between groups. Discussion. We demonstrate that systemic and intestinal mucosal inflammation, as measured by the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-8, is increased among very young children with cryptosporidiosis, compared with healthy control subjects. At enrollment, cytokine production of these systemic proinflammatory cytokines in case patients was greater than in control subjects. For unclear reasons, these differences reached statistical significance and were most prominent 6 months after Cryptosporidium infection. Increases in mucosal (fecal) TNF- a, but not IL-8, were also found at enrollment among case patients, but these elevated levels did not persist. The associ- ation of cryptosporidiosis with malnutrition (particularly stunt- ing) and vitamin A deficiency was also confirmed for this pop- ulation. Although our data will need to be expanded and confirmed with additional immunologic methods and a larger study population, they suggest that persistent, albeit subtle, systemic inflammation may adversely affect the health of a young child infected with Cryptosporidium species in a devel- oping country. Proinflammatory cytokines attract leukocytes to the intes- tinal tract, contributing to the clinical manifestations of cryp- tosporidial diarrhea. IL-8 and TNF-a have been studied in animal and cell lines and in human xenograft models, and they are consistently elevated in association with the inflammatory changes stimulated by Cryptosporidium infection [16-19]. Hu- man intestinal cell lines and human xenografts demonstrate production of these cytokines directly from the Cryptospori- dium-infected intestinal epithelial cell [ 17, 20]. Not surprisingly, the IL-8 response to Cryptosporidium (intracellular but extra- cytoplasmic parasite of the intestinal epithelial cell) is quanti- tatively lower than infection with invasive bacteria or Enta- moeba histolytica. In human studies, we and others have evaluated the role of proinflammatory cytokines and CXC chemokines in cryptos- poridiosis [6, 7, 14, 21]. In earlier studies of symptomatic Hai- tian and Brazilian children, levels of TNF-ao and IL-8 were elevated in fecal extracts at the time of diagnosis of cryptos- poridiosis [6, 7]. Our current study, which includes a healthy, nondiarrheal control group, confirms both in vitro and xen- ograft data, as well as enhanced intestinal TNF-a production in case patients. Systemic inflammatory cytokine increases and the persistence of inflammation have not previously been dem- onstrated in association with childhood cryptosporidiosis. It is intriguing to consider whether even mildly increased and persistent systemic and/or intestinal proinflammatory cy- tokine levels may be associated with linear growth failure (stunting), similar to the pediatric inflammatory bowel disease population, in which 40% of the effects of stunting are attrib- uted to the inflammatory response [22]. Children with Crohn disease have increased plasma concentrations of TNF-a, which has inhibitory effects on the growth axis via inhibition of mat- uration of growth plate chrondrocytes [23-27]. TNF-ao also stimulates bone resorption and inhibits new bone formation in vitro [28, 29]. Our study has several limitations, in addition to a small sample size. Importantly, the history of the child before en- rollment and his or her potential for previous Cryptosporidium infection or other enteric infections is unknown, and a few children differed with respect to HIV status. Many children presented with persistent diarrhea, which makes cytokine com- parisons with data from our initial studies difficult and may underestimate the degree of inflammation associated with the acute illness [7]. Detailed linear analyses of innate and adaptive responses to Cryptosporidium infection in a birth cohort are needed. Eval- uation of the role of host genetics in the production of pro- inflammatory cytokines, particularly among stunted children, will also increase our understanding of the interplay of infection and immune responses.
