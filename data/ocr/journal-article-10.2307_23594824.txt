<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPACE, AESTHETIC POWER, AND TRUE FALSITY IN THE KNOWN WORLD PAUL ARDOIN On the wall of a small jail in Edward P. Jones's fictional Manchester County hangs a map of "The Known World." Florida does not exist on the sixteenth-century map; North America is too small, and nameless. But the map's owner, local sheriff John Skiffington, is satisfied with the "Known World" as he knows it, flawed or not (Jones 174-75). Skiffington is holding together a flawed world of his own in Manchester, where wealthy landowners control the law, vindictive slave patrollers flout the law, and black slaveholders severely complicate the law. It is this last group, the black slaveholders, who confound and fascinate both the characters of Jones's 2003 novel and its readers. One slave overseer, Moses, "[takes] more than two weeks to come to understand that someone wasn't fiddling with him and that indeed a black man," Henry Townsend, "two shades darker than himself, owned him and any shadow he made" (8-9). Most critics and scholars have centered their work around this issue of black slaveholders,1 along with the book's long view of time, which allows readers to see what the future holds for many of Manchester's large cast of characters (as well as the fate of the doomed county itself).2 Sheriff Skiffington's out-of-date map, however, also points toward a type of geographical rubric at play in the novel, which draws attention to a marriage between space and structures of power. Throughout, The Known World highlights the roles of space and place in establishing and perpetuating systems of thought, and when we approach the novel from that angle, we find sketches for a productive action of resistance against those systems that is rooted in aesthetic power and modeled by the novel itself. The key form of resistance Jones's novel will position against the categories and boundaries that insist we can "know" the world—and the form of resistance that has been little discussed beyond reference to its climactic instantiation on the book's final pages— is an aesthetics that resists linearity and the idea of space as stable, truthful, and natural.

Systems of power tend to benefit from a double move—a "false falsity"—by both constructing space and disguising its constructed nature. The true falsity modeled in and by The Known World reinscribes systems and spaces while highlighting (in fact, celebrating) the impermanent and arbitrary nature of inscription. That is, a true falsity is a falsity that is not disguised. In this view, productive action insists on staying in-production: a permanent productivity demands a permanent instability and a never-fully-known world. Productive action, then, cannot be defined as following one specific trajectory or philosophy. Productive action must be action that refuses the convenient stability of closure or definition. For all its radical refusal of closure, however, this model functions happily in an apparently stable (intricately-plotted, in fact) novel. The Known World is coherent and comprehensible to a degree not often seen in works with such a postmodem agenda. This coherent instability is perhaps among its most important contributions to the contemporary novel. It illustrates and demonstrates the work of art that does more than simply expose or explode our conceptions of truth and art. It holds the ideas of time, space, and structure up for interrogation while utilizing the productive possibilities of such restricted forms as the novel and the sculpture. In this way, it refuses surrender or submission to anarchy as options in a world where unchallenged systems of power create real-life horrors. Productive art, in this model, straddles the same line as productive action: it exposes the realities of artistic space and then reinscribes that space in a way that insists no inscription is permanent. The most frequently cited of the novel's fictional artworks—a series of artistic maps I will address in more detail below—defies the boundaries of linear time while somehow remaining utterly recognizable and realistic, apparently down to the exact number of "blades of grass" (385). Jones himself utilizes that most temporally-restricted of artistic forms— the novel, which relies at its most basic level on the linearity of language, and then (in most traditional novels, at least) depends upon some set of temporal boundaries—and manages to both draw attention to and profit from the arbitrary rules of the form. For example, by highlighting a willingness to defy its own clear, useful temporal boundaries, Jones's novel exposes the arbitrary nature of measured, enclosed time while still making use of it as storytelling convention and retaining the beneficial effects of the recognizable. It is a formula for an intentional, productive, truthful falsity. All novels inherently manipulate time within their pages, from the order to the rate at which events unfold—sometimes by converting experienced time into a linguistic stream of consciousness, sometimes by compressing years of time into a single paragraph (as characters age, companies grow, and loves mature),</page><page sequence="3">640 / ARDOIN or sometimes by ballooning a moment into pages and pages of minute detail.3 The Known World draws attention to that manipulation of time through such techniques as the revelation of events that will occur generations beyond the deaths of the book's characters. At the same time, the novel does not hesitate to employ traditional (that is, less obvious) techniques for adjusting narrative speed throughout: Jones has more to gain than the mere overthrow of narrative sleight-of-hand. Simply exposing a falsehood, even when that falsehood has destructive consequences, is not the sole goal or end result. The Known World bridges fictional and "real" worlds, bends time to its will, and demonstrates a productive, honest way to tell a lie with an arrangement of space, whether literal or literary. The novel's plot traffics in all varieties of the invisible ideologies disguised beneath spaces, but the novel itself celebrates the spaces that make intent and purpose visible, thereby remaining open to future reinscription. This is "true falsity"—a reinscription of space that, in its first step, reveals the constructed nature of day-to-day space as we are used to understanding (or not understanding, or barely noticing) it and, in its second step, insists on the possibility of a continuing process of reinscription, resisting permanency and reminding us that we, too, have the capability to challenge, interpret, or construct spatial meaning. True falsity acts as a sort of perpetual revolution with no reachable utopia. It offers a bridge between a coherence that demands at least a basic degree of structure and a freedom that refuses to be lulled into submission to an apparently stable system. This article necessarily arranges itself into stages, in order to speak both of content and form. I will begin with a brief discussion of the relationship between maps and power, something that has seen increased attention in emerging fields of study such as geocriticism and literary cartography. From the appearance of its first black slaveholder, The Known World begins to expand this maps/ power relationship to a commentary on the false nature of all bounded space: a space with shape and purpose, the book reveals, is inherently a created space and cannot feign a "natural" state, free from power relationships and imposed meaning. From here, I look toward resulting implications for the possibility of productive action. If all bounding of space comes with the imposition of new unnatural borders, how can we be sure we are changing the system rather than merely the pieces in it? Perhaps even more difficult is the task of changing the very conception of space and systems as permanent or inevitable. The model of The Known World is a model of a productive action that is rooted in challenging the very idea of permanent, bounded space: it embraces the marginal and contradictory, and it acts against stability, because a truly productive action must challenge the very logic of systemized space. This challenge comes by acknowledging, for example, that any action to change a space simply replaces an old with a new; but the challenge sketched out here refuses to aim for or privilege a new stability. That is, it aims to reveal the arbitrary, unnatural nature of supposed stability, to expose the lie of a natural marriage between a system</page><page sequence="4">JONES / 641 and a space, and then to hold that revelation open to prevent the concretion of a new system. I will return, finally, to Jones, who joins a tradition of authors who challenge the linearity and boundedness of the novel as an art form, through his overall structure (which often resembles a short story cycle as much as it does a novel) and through his techniques (most apparent as a zooming forward and backward in time and in and out from community to character), which he applies toward the management of a story that remains able to be both intricately plotted (with all the inevitability that comes alongside the omnipotent author-god) and, at the same time, resistant to any idea of complete closure. His novel becomes the model for the true falsity I described above: it exposes the constructed nature of systems and structure, and it necessarily (and to great effect) does so in a structured form (rather than proposing a mere anarchy of shapes and symbols on a page, for example), but it utilizes a form that refuses hard, fast, permanent closure (through its play with nonexistent intertexts; by foregrounding a willingness to violate its own arbitrary boundaries). Jones's choice to focus on the issue of the black slaveholder, then, is a fitting one for a study in open contradiction and the possible ways to put contradiction to productive work. Unnatural Geography and Ideological Space Professional geographers tend to hold a different view of space and borders than the layperson. Alexander Diener and Joshua Hagen explain that though "for many people, the lines that divide the world's landmasses possess an air of unquestionable sanctity, as though they were based on some higher logic," alas, "this is simply not the case" (3). Indeed, those who make a career of geography "have long discounted the notion of 'natural' borders. All borders... are and have always been constructions of human beings." And as a result, all borders are "subject, contrived, negotiated, and contested" (3). That is, all borders are falsehoods that disguise themselves as truths, falsehoods that are twice false by attempting to rewrite the natural and then cloak that rewriting and pass themselves off as natural to the "many." From this revelation, it was a perhaps inevitable step for poststructural i st "historians of cartography" to note that—because borders play a pivotal role in the arrangement of maps—maps themselves are "a product of compromises, omissions, and interpretations, depending on what information a cartographer wishes to show" and that all maps "are shaped by 'social forces'" (Van Noy 9). Maps work to "construct, not reproduce, the world" (Van Noy 9), but the results of the construction are usually depicted without commentary: after constructing the world, the resulting neatly-organized map covers over the messy reality of space with a knowable (but deceptive) world. This constructing work of maps, then, is not necessarily construct-/ve. In How to Lie with Maps, Mark Monmonier describes maps as "subject to distortions arising from ignorance, greed, ideological blindness, or malice"</page><page sequence="5">642 / ARDOIN (2). Even before the sheriff's map was wrong by being out of date, it was already wrong by portraying a carved and cataloged world. And that very process of carving and cataloging has winners, losers, motives, mistakes. At this moment in the novel and others, The Known World seems to imagine implications and incidents we could parallel directly alongside some of Monmonier's chapter titles and section headings: among them "cartographic carelessness," "deliberate blunders," and "Making Nonsense of the Census." Under "deliberate blunders," we might file any number of geographical acts of slavery, from kidnapping and forced relocation to the idea that slavery might be legal in some parts of a nominally-united nation but unspeakable in others. The other two headings—"cartographic carelessness" and "Making Nonsense of the Census"—should resonate specifically with readers of Jones: "The census of 1860 said there were 2,670 slaves in Manchester County, but the census taker...had argued with his wife the day he sent his report to Washington, D.C., and all his arithmetic was wrong because he had failed to carry a one" (Jones 7). In one of many moments that blur the distinction between fiction and reality in a novel that will reference nonexistent academic texts, the character of the census taker has sent an unintentionally fictional report to a national government office, thereby fictionalizing Manchester County (and for readers, creating one of many labyrinths of the true and false—the census taker's Manchester is true to him but made false in his report, while the census taker and the county are both fictions to us as readers, which means he has made a fiction of a fiction). Sheriff Skiffington's outdated map of "The Known World," like census data and all maps, is not peculiar in its fallibility or its utility. It emphasizes certain details, neglects others, is shaped by social forces (and sometimes accidents or gaps in knowledge), and shapes social forces in its turn. The inclusion of this particular map, alongside stories such as that of the flawed census, highlights both the falsities that emerge inevitably as part of the very process of mapmaking and the additional layer of falsity that sets in once the ink dries and the falsehoods begin to be treated as true enough. This is a twice-false brand of falsity, most dangerous because it (with time and complacency very much on its side) covers over the precariousness of its very moment of inception. A map is but one of the many ways we shape space, and space, as we have seen, is never outside of human construction and never wholly unrelated to systems of power—even the accidental shaping of space results in winners and losers. Following a long line of theorists of space,4 David Delaney recounts a history of racialized space in the United States, specifically. Delaney investigates spaces as far back as the slave ship and the plantation, focusing in the latter case on details like the placement of slave quarters in relationship to "the big house": "It was a geography of discipl ine and confinement and, for most slaves, extremely limited mobility" (35). The very title of The Known World (henceforth TKW) prepares us for an exploration of the limits of mobility, and</page><page sequence="6">JONES / 643 the very name of the absent figure at the center of the story (readable as almost heavy-handed when we space it out: Henry Town's-enzf) brings those limits to the center of focus: it is the Townsend family that will not be able to escape from slavery even after they have escaped. Slight variations to geographical details become matters of large significance in TKW. Delaney would certainly find significance in the fact that "Field slaves" of the light-skinned, black slaveholder Fern Elston "lived in quarters closer to their masters than any hands at any plantation or farm in Virginia" (134), closer than the slaves of the white William Robbins or the dark-skinned Henry Townsend. "Those Elstons didn't have slaves, colored people said, they had neighbors who happened to be slaves." But Fern is indisputably still a slave owner. Her map varies slightly from those of other local slave owners, but the true relations of domination differ not at all. To deny that sad truth is to pile falsity atop falsity. In TKW, even the very layout of the town reflects position and philosophy. Augustus and Mildred Townsend, the parents of Henry who bought themselves and then him out of slavery, make their home as far from slavery as possible within the county lines, at the town's end: "Augustus Townsend liked it because it was at the farthest end of the county and the nearest white man with slaves was half a mile away" (15). Augustus insists on keeping his property free from the evidence of slavery, throwing his son out when Henry announces his first purchase of another human being and declaring, "I promised myself when I got this little bit of land that I would never suffer a slaveowner to set foot on it. Never" (138). With that, Augustus maps out a space for himself where power can operate according to a new set of rules, and slaveholders—even his son—will not control him (at least not directly). Significantly, he still resides within the larger boundaries of a county that need not respect his personal boundaries, as he finds out when his free papers are chewed up and swallowed by a local slave patroller and he is sold back into the system he thought he had escaped (212-16). The space he sought to map out for himself, it seems, was not far enough geographically or psychologically to escape the relations of domination within Manchester County. Augustus exhibits similar baby-steps toward reimagining space during his visits to Henry's plantation, insisting on sleeping in slave housing rather than "in the house their son and his slave had built" (66-67). For Augustus, space is political, and geographical decisions are philosophical ones. Surely, he is right on both counts. His mistake is to imagine minor geographical adjustments as permanent and to imagine he can live freely within a larger space coded toward enslavement and left fundamentally intact. Thinking in these terms is perhaps the most appropriate way to approach the apparent paradox of black slaveholders. They are operating within a space that rewards those who take what is available to them within the spatial arrangement. They might make slight changes to that arrangement (moving their slave quarters closer to their own houses, for example), but they are unwilling to jeopardize their own situation by rearranging space in a way power</page><page sequence="7">644 / ARDOIN is not likely to tolerate. Simply changing the skin color of the slave owner does nothing to change the geography or the rules assigned to it. It perhaps disrupts boundaries enough to cause discomfort, but disruption is quickly sidestepped, and real transgression avoided, when the overall spatial systems of power remain intact and the so-called truth of a space remains unchallenged. The only way to truly challenge the operation of a space is through resistance, and Henry and the other black slaveholders are not a real resistance to the space but a perpetuation of it. That Henry is not ashamed of his position is no surprise: he is a man whose sympathy is for the Devil in Paradise Lost who "would rather rule in hell than serve in heaven" (134). Henry is fortunate enough to have a choice of how to operate in the space of Manchester County, and he chooses to take what the space will allow him.5 His plantation is a space that operates according to all of the normal rules of the space of Manchester, regardless of who is in charge. A plantation might keep operating even without a master or an overseer present at all, as long as no one challenges the space or the power behind it by, for example, running away or refusing to leave the slave quarters for work out in the field. The latter of these two forms of challenge is perhaps the more potentially effective, as Bartleby the Scrivener's boss might attest. And the former, one might argue, is less resistance to the powers of a space than mere relocation from one coded space to another. The runaway slave, by this logic, actually accepts the code of a space by acknowledging that since the plantation is a place for slaves, one must leave that space if one hopes to be free. The shape of lasting resistance is a tricky matter. Throughout TKW, characters who think they are transgressing the ideology of the space they occupy are, in fact, blind to the ineffective or worse nature of their supposed transgression. John Skiffington, for example, "despite vowing never to own a slave...had no trouble doing his job to keep the institution of slavery going" (43). When John's name is cited as a supporting moral authority during the scene of harassment and eventual recapture and sale of the free Augustus, it is clear that despite his personal feelings, he has become a sort of representative of the validity of the practice of slavery and all its related crimes. He supervises the slave patrollers who supervise the streets, granting their actions, by extension, authority of the law. Skiffington finds ways to live with his contradictions, chief among them Minerva, the slave he and his wife Winifred receive as a wedding gift. Though Winifred declares and John agrees that "slavery was not something she wanted in her life" (33), they do not free Minerva. Through a complicated bit of reasoning, the two decide that Minerva will, in fact, be better off in their possession than otherwise: "Selling her would be out of the question because they could not know what would become of her....And giving her away was no better than selling her" (33-34). They believe they cannot simply set her free because of "what their neighbors might say" (34), so they decide to keep Minerva but think of her as a daughter rather than a slave (34). They</page><page sequence="8">jones / 645 do not consult Minerva, potential family member, about the decision. For the Skiffingtons, their feelings are enough to make Minerva as free as she need be. When she walks away from this life, years later in Philadelphia, she will declare herself "a free woman" and decline to ever return to life with Winifred (381). Winifred, significantly, will still not see the problem with the missing person notices she posts that describe the missing girl with the less-than human, "Will Answer To The Name Minnie" (381). Winifred believes the tragedy here is the loss of her daughter, but the tragedy is that she has attempted only to bend the rules of space. By determining Minerva's fate (as slave or daughter), Winifred keeps existing power relations completely intact. A change in geography puts the lie to Winifred's fantasy. She had imagined her private world with John and "Minnie" exempt from the larger space of the South, but that private world existed only in the heads of John and Winifred. In the North, there is no reason for Minerva to participate in Winifred's fantasy world, and, inevitably, she soon refuses to do so. Winifred's fantasy of acting as mother to her own property is, in reality, no sort of action at all. It is among the most false brands of falsities, as Minerva recognizes from her loosened and reupholstered but still very intact bindings. But perhaps the most doomed brand of action in the text (read: least likely to produce the kind of lasting disruption we might classify as true falsity) belongs to Moses. We first meet Moses the slave and overseer on the evening of Henry's death. "Before leaving the fields...Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it" (1 ). We learn that Moses shares a special connection with the soil: "he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because the eating of it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life" (2). Trudier Harris points out that these scenes mislead readers with a simple message of a man as "one with nature, someone with whom readers might identify and sympathize with against his master" (187). This contradicts, Harris explains, "Moses's true personality," revealed later when we see that Moses has "embraced the more abusive sides of power and enslavement. He uses his position to intimidate other blacks and to remind them constantly that he is a step above them" (Harris 187). This occurs after Henry's death, when Moses begins an affair with the widow, Caldonia. As the affair progresses, Moses imagines himself soon being freed by Caldonia and taking Henry's place as both husband and master. Moses acts decisively, but all this action is in the service only of Moses's advancement within the existing structure, a plan we can tie back to Moses's inability to imagine beyond the idea of boundaries. Perhaps the central characteristic of this overseer is his local-ness. We meet him as he tastes land tainted by its corrupt use, and his goal in life becomes to rearrange his position on the same land. Moses cannot conceive of life outside of the boundaries he knows, so he hopes only to maximize what he can get within the existing</page><page sequence="9">646 / ARDOIN boundaries. His early scene in the woods at first appears to be a bold, border crossing act. But there is no danger to the system in the act. Where other characters, Alice for example, see the woods as the beginning of a borderland6 of the existing system, Moses always enters the woods with the intention of returning to the plantation proper. And when he finally leaves the boundaries he has set for himself, he immediately gets lost and turned around. Moses, long mocked by other characters for being "world stupid" (268), "could have found his way around Caldonia's plantation with no eyes and even no hands... but where he was walking now was not that place" (334). Moses's attachment to the local means that during his attempted escape he "did not know enough about the world to know he was going south": he is escaping further into the system of slavery (334), just as his attempted move up the rungs of power was itself a subscription to the validity of the power structure. His connection to the land might first be read as magical or inspiring,7 but any empowerment he finds in that place (a place stained by history and a place to which he is tied under threat of death) is quickly squandered on his ill-fated attempt to move up in the world by quietly finding a spot further embedded in it.8 It is this sense of doom and paralysis over which more than one early reviewer of TKW agonizes.9 But Jones gives us a few models for positive action, chief among them Alice, the supposedly-crazy, supposed victim of a supposed kick from a nonexistent mule. Of all Henry's slaves, Alice has the most freedom of movement available to her, simply because she refuses to stay where she is supposed to. By feigning insanity, Alice places herself on the margins. Others begin to expect bizarre, marginal behavior from her, so she is implicitly allowed to wander off the plantation. Since she always returns to the plantation by morning, and since she already occupies the liminal space that is insanity, local patrollers and slave owners worry less and less about policing her actions and movements. In the meantime, Alice is expanding her own frontiers and rewriting the boundaries of slavery in Manchester County. She is already cartographer and artist, then, long before her climactic act of aesthetic revision. She seems to acknowledge the power of boundaries while actively resisting them. Alice's ambiguous, contradictory behavior and role in the community allow her to essentially redraw her own boundaries and then truly map the space of Manchester County. By wandering off night after night, Alice gets to know the space of Manchester as well as Moses knows the space of the plantation, and that act of mental cartography prepares her to lead herself and (importantly) others out of slavery. She is challenging extant understandings of space, creating a new map (always, as we know, an act of selection, an act with motives) with each new night. She is repeatedly toying with the codes of space in order to productively set the stage for a true act of resistance. Later, Alice's strategy of remapping becomes literal when she produces works of art that recreate Manchester County according to her understanding of the space and defying official truths. She first masters the space, then rewrites it. She</page><page sequence="10">JONES / 647 uses the tools of destabilization towards the dually productive acts of helping others challenge space as currently written and creating a work of art with the aesthetic goal of unsettling boundaries of time, space, and conventional logic. It is important to note, though, that it is not simply Alice's position on the margins that allows her to save two other slaves and herself. It is her action to move herself to the margins and then her actions from those margins that produce true freedom. More than one border theorist has called for a border writing that can de-territorialize systems and nation-states by refusing to remain static,10 and perhaps Alice's art will have the opportunity to play such a role from its eventual display in Washington, DC. But crossing borders and remapping space are not inherently productive acts on their own. The essential thing about Alice's artworks—multimedia maps that recreate the county of Manchester and Henry's plantation—is that they are engaged in a process of ««-disciplining space by breaking down the boundaries of time and truth. Her maps are lies, like all maps can be, but they are truthful lies, exposing the falsity of all maps. She meticulously details all aspects of the space of the plantation, but then she includes dead people amongst the living. To emphasize that this is no mere remembrance of things past, she creates a sort of Proustian time paradox: the dead are depicted in their living states, but their graves are depicted as well. In this way, Alice leaves conventional borders intact in her artistic maps—in fact, she foregrounds and emphasizes the borders by placing (for example) Henry next to his own grave, with the grave "covered with flowers as though he still inhabits it" (386)—while denying their (the borders') power. Viewers of the artwork might describe it as placing death "under erasure" (sous rature) in an act of intentional paradox that remaps the world as we know it." The result is simultaneously postmodern and comprehensible, true and not-true. We might contrast this with a "false" act of border-crossing that seeks to simply expand the code of one space onto another—a false falsity, one that looks like truth but remains a lie—as in the case of the less admirable cousin of John Skiffington, Counsel Skiffington. After Counsel's entire family and all of his slaves die of smallpox, leaving him the sole human survivor on his plantation, he burns his property and rides south, then west. His journey becomes more and more confused and surreal as he tries to comprehend life outside of his normal place. In Chattahoochee, poverty forces him to hire himself out as a laborer alongside free black workers as if they are his equals, and he collapses after fewer than four days of this, convinced he is going to die (228). As his geographical movement continues, the very earth seems to be coming apart at the seams: "he came to a wide expanse of land that seemed without end, parched grass and soil widening with cracks that were a foot or more in some places" (228). Things come to a surreal head in the territorial borderland of Texas when he finds himself in the midst of a multiethnic community, traveling together as</page><page sequence="11">648 / ARDOIN equals. When a black man in the crowd addresses him, Counsel is so unused to being addressed as an equal by someone of darker skin that at first he is not even able to recognize the words the man is saying. He is convinced it is not even American English, though he realizes later that it has been so all along. "Counsel wondered if the authorities knew about all these people," these blacks, whites, Mexicans, and perhaps even a boy "from the Orient," sitting together in wagons, traveling with arms around one another. "There was something wrong here," Counsel knew, "and the government of Texas should be doing something about it" (239). His sense of order, even down to the measure of time—"Had he said that only an hour ago? A few days ago? Or was it the remnant of a conversation from a dream?" (239)—collapses. His system of thought cannot hold at the frontier, heading west through the marginal, young state of Texas. By the time he gives up his journey west, Counsel is on the ground, "talking to God" (243). This less-tamed region has remapped him by embracing contradiction and challenging his "known" world. He will bring that scrambled psyche with him when he retreats back to Manchester County, the solidly-known world of his cousin. Even characters who hold our sympathy, such as Augustus, need to do more than find a space on the periphery in order to expect positive results. Bassard points out that though readers might "want to view Augustus' self purchase and the purchase of his family as a sign of agency, even he will become entrapped within the confines of the power line" (415). The death of Augustus stands as complicating challenge to thinkers who celebrate the borderlands for their own sake. However, after buying Henry out of slavery, for a brief moment Augustus does demonstrate the power of a decisive challenge to the allegedly impermeable boundaries of a presiding system. And it is no coincidence that this action occurs through his work as artist (or artisan). A slave named Rita grabs onto Augustus's moving wagon and begs him to take her away from a plantation (45). Moved by the pleas of his family to help her, Augustus does, hiding her in his home until he can secrete her in a crate bound for New York (47). It is a makeshift, spur-of-the-moment, border-puncturing underground railroad, and it works. Author Jones makes the vessel of escape a crate filled with the intricately designed walking sticks Augustus carves. Art here is depicted as a real way to challenge real borders. Augustus might have decided to expand and continue the heroic rebellion, but he does not. Instead, he returns to the safety of a belief in the power of boundaries—in his case the power of the walls of his own home to shield his family from the larger world of slavery. That is, he continues to believe in the stability, safety, and permanence of rigid systems. As a result, he first loses his son (when Henry becomes a slaveholder) and then his own freedom and life.12 Augustus believes that by declaring his private space free from slavery, he can make reality remain so. He ends up back in chains, and then dead. As a brief aside, it is worth noting that at some point, Augustus's house</page><page sequence="12">jones / 649 does become reshaped into a space that (at large peril) resists the larger, outside space more actively. We learn after the deaths of both Augustus and Mildred about the presence of "hidden compartments in the house...designed to hide slaves for the underground railroad" (376-77), but even the word "designed" is tricky here. We do not know when they were designed or who designed them. We know Augustus built the house in the 1830s, before the main events of the book. At that time, his family was not yet free (and, historically, the Underground Railroad was not yet close to its widespread peak). The house was built before Augustus helps Rita to escape, which is undeniably his first act of this sort, and an act that takes place before he has any place to hide Rita inside the house. No mention is made of this particular event spurring Augustus to immediate continuing action—something that would have clearly been repeatedly witnessed by and presumably of some larger influence on young Henry. Up to Henry's death in 1855, there is no indication that he knows of an underground railroad through his parents' house; in fact, he keeps hoping for their pride in his accomplishments as a slaveholder. It may be that Henry's conversion to slaveholder (or the event of Henry's death) encourages Augustus's more active (though hidden) form of resistance. Or the hidden compartments may have been Mildred's additions, constructed after (perhaps because of) Augustus's recapture, sale, and death (see note 11). The timeline is impossible to know conclusively, but clearly the political act here follows the artistic one—a point of no small interest. Also of interest is Jones's almost off hand mention of this significant form of resistance so late in the novel (a mere eleven pages from the book's physical end, in fact): the action that is able to take place on the periphery of the county (again, the town's end) is presented so peripherally in the novel as to almost risk being passed by unnoticed. It is only, in fact, the unanswerable question raised by the word "designed" that draws attention to what might be a momentous off-stage evolution in Augustus's character and worldview. Here Jones again refuses the surety of the known. Such questions make themselves of interest to us, and such explorations are available to us, because TKW, in its story and its telling, has foregrounded a connection between space and individual agency. Augustus joins a catalog of other characters who resist acting against the very idea of bordered space and thus find themselves doomed to be acted on by space. Such inaction strengthens the inertial power of space. When Elias the slave gives up trying to literally escape the boundaries of the plantation and opts for the (at best) metaphorical resistance of love with Celeste, he simply plays right into the hands of power: he approaches Henry with a sort of deal that "if his master blessed [his relationship with Celeste], he would never again dream of being on that road." For Henry, the deal is "better than chains," and Elias is now even more "bound" without "a chain in sight" (102). Elias, like Augustus, turns to an inward structure—an intimate freedom that benefits no one but his own</page><page sequence="13">650 / ARDOIN family unit (which, ironically, becomes bound more firmly than before within the larger system). Turning inward becomes another sort of false falsity. The idea of personal freedom within a stable system is a self-deception. This is the problem Barnum (one of three local night patrollers) experiences when he has an opportunity to buck an extreme cruelty of the space of slavery—Travis's sale of the free Augustus back into slavery—but instead backs down. Barnum retreats into a multi-day bender for want of a special space within space, "some kinda light" inside of which a person can stand "and declare what he knows without retribution" or threat of being called "a nigger kisser or somethin like that" (303). He wants to enter a safe space in which he can report on the abuse he has seen before returning to a life of intentional ignorance, so as to perhaps soothe his own conscience without violating the expectations of the larger space. This is typical of Barnum, who cares for his own dying slave like a family member while picking up a paycheck for patrolling the borders of slavery. But not only is personal space inseparable from political space, the retreat to personal space is an entrenchment and tacit endorsement of the power structures of the larger space. Barnum wants the possibility of not knowing, but this policing of personal space is a mere sidestepping of an unpleasant reality; it is a personal, false way (that is, no effective way at all) to rewrite space. We see this function exhibited most clearly in that map John Skiffington owns of the "Known World." A man of foreign birth offers him a "better map, and more map of today. Map of today, how the world out together today, not yesterday, not long ago" (174). But John says, "I'm happy with what I got"—a stable, unchanging world he is capable of policing without moral quandary. John functions as the perfect example of seemingly noble intentions gone awry. He is steered in almost every decision by truth and justice, represented for him in the space of the Law. But the Law in the space of Manchester County is not truthful and just, so he is forced to not notice and therefore not act on some things. Even in a case like the clearly unlawful sale of Augustus, John still hesitates. "When he started...there had been certainty that selling Augustus Townsend was a crime, but he became less certain....Had Virginia, in fact, declared such a sale a crime?" (311 ). As a result of his hesitation, John loses five days before being reassured by the government that yes, a crime had occurred. Because he was worried that he might have stepped outside his own version of Barnum's protective light, he needed to be sure that his gut instinct toward morality was lining up with official protocol of a government space bigger and more authoritative than his own.13 His moral compass points toward the capital; he relies on the declared rulers of a space to tell him what the rules of that space are.</page><page sequence="14">JONES / 651 Remapping Our Known World John Skiffington, owner of the map of his known world, becomes the novel's most straightforward evidence that we tie even our most basic views of right and wrong to things as apparently innocuous in our daily lives as space and geography. Look, for example, at the recent attention (spurred by the sesquicentennial) to the widespread refusal to believe slavery was the primary cause for the civil war. Slavery gets swallowed up by issues more obviously geographical (states' rights, "the clash of industrial and agrarian cultures,"14 northern aggression, unfair geographical appropriation of tax revenue, and so on). And when we focus on the South as the location of slavery, particularly when we put it into a geographical binary that seems to insist space simply acts on space—north on south and south on north, with nothing in between—we assign geography a power disconnected from individual actors. We then want to believe we end the consequences of slavery with a simple reunion of North and South—once the geographical issues are settled, our problems are over. In reality, actors shape spaces that, in turn, shape lives and supposed realities. Jones's project with TKW demonstrates a way to begin to combat such abuses by drawing his own, unstable map.15 Like the book's most obvious artist figure (Alice), Jones takes advantage of the narrative power that all kinds of maps offer—maximizing, minimizing, privileging, telescoping—to reveal the ways in which everyone in Manchester County is an actor shaping the space, even if only through inaction. His is a map that truthfully highlights the inherent falsity of maps without jettisoning the coherency made available by intentionally shaping narrative space. Space—we see as Jones zooms ahead a century or back half of one, a frequent disruptive act performed on a narrative which nonetheless remains comprehensible—is no mere natural, a-temporal, a-historical container: the novel can move freely, confidently, almost showily through time. Art can refuse to be limited to the known, refuse to accept categorizations. It can blow apart the very physics of space (narrative or otherwise), opening up our ways of experiencing it, making visible its unnatural operations, undisciplining it. For example, Jones follows the lead of paratextual manipulators like Nabokov (whose Pale Fire breaks down the border between fictional and nonfictional aspects of the novel by hiding his story in pseudo academic endnotes), as well as more recent and reader-friendly experimenters like Mark Z. Danielewski (whose House of Leaves uses extensive, fictional, academic footnoting as a way to add verisimilitude to a haunted house story), by incorporating a number of fictional historians into the pages of TKW. One pamphleteer serves as a device to fill in exposition, but another, "University of Virginia historian Roberta Murphy" (43), puts pressure against the borders of fiction and the physical borders of the book itself when Jones details the publication history of her "1979 book.. .rejected by the University of Virginia Press and finally published by the University of North Carolina Press," earning her a promotion to "full professor at Washington and Lee University" (43-44).</page><page sequence="15">652 / ARDOIN The intertextual play both refuses to allow us to read this interior book as a mere fiction from a fictional world—challenging the supposed distance between the real and the aesthetic—and again demonstrates the ability of art to highlight, complicate, and profit from the novel form's inherent challenges of time and space. The linear nature of language may produce space, but so too may it be challenged or imbued with politics and meaning as an aesthetic space. We might also look at TKW as a warning: the mappers of power are vigilant. We cannot simply wait for a newer, more favorable map to put us on it: any resulting improvement of position would leave the rules of the game intact. We must reimagine and then recreate our own space, one that refuses the temptations of stability, finality, and closure, and one that in fact celebrates its unknowability—making a truth of the falseness that accompanies any shaping or reshaping, any creation and recreation of space. Alice's maps foreground contradiction in that effort. Jones's novel challenges the nature of written truth and foregrounds the making of truths and fictions in order to both clear space and to avoid permanently colonizing it. TKW, then, refuses the idea that any world can or should be entirely "known," where to know is to (falsely!) attach a rigid set of truths to a space. A known world is a stagnant, immobilizing world, encouraging inaction and building inertia against actions that would produce new realities. We would perhaps be wise to begin to recognize political struggles as something other than one side against another, the powerful against the powerless. TKW suggests a more essential struggle between inertial power (the ultimate of false falsities, coded in and then perpetuated by space) and constant disruption (a truthful falsity). Constant disruption is a perpetual revolution through perpetual revelation, aligning the political and the artistic by juxtaposing and mixing, by challenging borders, by resisting the logic of linearity, by refusing stability, by writing a still-coherent-and-recognizable novel that refuses the rules of "novel," and by resisting summary (with the latter a characteristic that makes a book like TKW so difficult to tackle in an academic article). FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY NOTES Thanks to David Ikard and Fiona McWilliam for offering feedback on early drafts of this article. ' Thomas Pressly, for example, uses the oft-stated premise of The Known World as a jumping off point for examining questions of historical accuracy in his "The Known World of Free Black Slaveholders." Katherine Clay Bassard focuses on the "wider context of black slaveowning that reconfigures the coordinates of race, gender, and power" (407). See also Ikard's intriguing "White</page><page sequence="16">jones / 653 Supremacy under Fire," which flips that paradigm around in order to explore the various crises of white identity in this novel full of contradictions. 2 Reviewer Wyatt Mason is interested in how Jones's works enact what Jones refers to as "the power to go all the way back" through what Mason describes as "a curious kind of summoning" in "Ballad for Americans: The stories of Edward P. Jones." Here, Mason brushes against part of what I read as a refusal of closure in The Known World. By highlighting a willingness to defy its own temporal boundaries, Jones's novel exposes the arbitrary nature of measured time while making use of it as storytelling convention. 3 See Gérard Genette's Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method for a lucid and insightful discussion of what he calls narrative speed. 4 For a few examples: philosopher Henri Lefebvre describes space as "produced by the forces and relations of production and property" and "a product of relations of domination" (214); feminist thinker Margaret Higonnet lays out the special complications of space when theorized via gender; and Anssi Paasi writes that every bordered space on the globe is "imbued with politics and meaning" (28). 5 As critic Susan Donaldson points out, "Henry is all too eager to learn the rules of the public, or official, transcript" (276). 6 See Gloria Anzaldúa on "La Mestiza," the "divergent think[er|" who "straddle[s].. .two or more cultures" and, in doing so, "creates a new consciousness," altering "the way we perceive reality" (102). La Mestiza is able to do this "by remaining flexible" and avoiding "habitual formulations." Such a figure "copes by developing a tolerance for contradictions, a tolerance for ambiguity" (101). We might ultimately imagine Anzaldúa's "cultures" in terms of the literary and theoretical cultures Jones straddles—novelist? short story writer? academic? historian? 7 Affect theorist Kathleen Stewart reads a thrilling "contact zone" in the soil-eating scene and, apparently, a sort of Deleuzian rhizome of possible futures for the doomed Moses (78), but the antifascism at which Deleuzian thought allegedly aims could never find a hero in a figure content to simply move upward in an existing system. (Such would be the Deleuzian celebration of personal freedom at its most antisocial and selfish—an unfortunate, omnipresent danger in most philosophies of "freedom," some might say.) Moses is revealed by the novel as completely (and literally) grounded, not free; he resists true possibility. 8 Ironically, when Moses is caught he is hobbled, an act that ties him permanently to the plantation he knows so well. 9 For example, John Freeman's 2003 Boston Globe review claims, "It is difficult to read this book without wishing we could change history; it is impossible to finish it without full awareness of how futile is that dream" (para. 10). 10 D. Emily Hicks celebrates this idea in Border Writing: The Multidimensional Text. And in "Reflections on Border Theory, Culture, and the Nation," Alejandro Lugo sees marginal borderlands of the less-privileged as the site for an interdisciplinarity with the potential to undermine traditional power structures. 11 Jones makes a similar move in the novel when he depicts the activities of characters after their deaths. After Augustus's death, "he rose up above the barn where he had died, up above the trees and the crumbling smokehouse and the little family house nearby, and he walked away quick-like" (346). He travels to his house, where he sees his wife sleeping and then places a kiss on her that penetrates "through skin and bone" (347). The anthropomorphic kiss then gets "frustrated" and "desperate" at not being able to reach the heart until finally "squeezing through the bars" of the ribcage, "kiss[ingj Mildred's heart" and waking her with the knowledge that Augustus is dead. (Might this be the moment that spurs construction of the house's hidden underground railroad compartments?) 12 His outlook ends up a kind of reflection of the philosophy of thinkers like Melvin Dixon, who sees a possibility for verbal performance to allow actors "to create alternative landscapes"—a sort of metaphorical geography—and find a kind of rootedness there (2-3). 13 Delaney points out that this kind of ambiguousness about the actions of slaveholders was typical of the time, and there were often "tensions...between planters and" the patrollers they viewed as "disorderly and drunk whites who had no respect for property" (40-41). 14 Time magazine addresses these secondary and/or non-causes in "The Way We Weren't." The Washington Post ran a similar piece titled, "Five Myths about Why the South Seceded."</page><page sequence="17">654 / ARDOIN 15 Mason is among the early critics to read the book itself as the "kind of map of life in the County of Manchester, Virginia" that Calvin sees in Alice's work (Jones 384).
