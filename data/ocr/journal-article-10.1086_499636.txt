      <p>What Lacan claims to discover in “biblical or judaic ideology”—that is, the Hebrew Bible—is an epistemic break with “pagan” antiquity, a crucial first step, in fact, toward the modern, where the modern is defined by the possibility and ideal of science.1 Alexandre Kojève offers a similar hypothesis, with the telling difference, however, that he locates this break in Christianity: “Si donc le christianisme est responsable de la Science moderne, c’est le dogme chrétien de l’Incarnation qui en porte la responsabilité exclusive.”2 According to Jean‐Claude Milner, one should interpret their difference thus: Lacan emphasizes the letter, Kojève the spirit.3 What concerns me here, however, isn’t deciding between the two or determining the epistemology of modern science. I merely wish to indicate what could be at stake in something as obscure (old) as the Bible. Does “biblical or judaic ideology” in fact constitute a break? If so, what is the nature of this cut, which imposed itself upon knowledge? There is, so I will argue, an epistemic rupture in ancient Israelite knowledge, constituting a momentous development in metaphysical thought. It is given its most explicit and rigorous formulation in the Priestly writings (P) of the Pentateuch, specifically in the priests’ radically new concept of the divine. I therefore propose in this preliminary treatment of the problem to focus on the Priestly ideology of God and the sacred.4</p>
      <p>While the Priestly source gives expression to the most abstract idea of God in the Pentateuch—evidence, according to the classical documentary hypothesis, of the lateness of P’s composition5—it also evinces, at least in certain respects, the most mythical conception of God. If it is generally accepted that P, in the words of Israel Knohl, has “reached heights of abstraction and distancing from anthropomorphism unparalleled in the Bible,”6 its sacrificial cult is nonetheless premised on an apparently cyclical time, what Mircea Eliade—to invoke one particularly compelling theory of myth—would call an “eternal return.”7 Thus, the overarching structure of its sacred calendar—namely, Sabbath, Sabbatical Year, and Jubilee—has been aptly described by Binyamin Uffenheimer as three “concentric cycles.”8 And the various rituals associated with the New Year, Day of Atonement, and Passover all appear, at least at first glance, like mythical “reactualizations” of divine acts (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 68–113).9</p>
      <p>This apparent contradiction comes into particular focus in P’s understanding of the “tent of meeting.” On the one hand, the anthropomorphic metaphor underlying the very idea of the house of God has been carefully expunged from P’s version of it. The divine appearance (<italic>kābôd</italic>) that takes up residence in the tent (Exod. 40:34–38) is an inhuman fiery numinous abstraction (Exod. 24:17).10 God does not “live” (<italic>yšb</italic>)—literally “sit”—in his palace‐temple as he does in other traditions (1 Sam. 4:4, 2 Sam. 6:2, 1 Kings 8:13),11 but in a more abstract—that is, disembodied—sense “dwells” (<italic>škn</italic>, Exod. 25:8, 29:45–46) there, in order to “meet” (<italic>yʿd</italic>, Exod. 25:22) with and only with Moses and reveal the law without deigning to enter into conversation with him.12 Correspondingly, the temple service itself is reinterpreted: God does not consume the various priestly sacrifices but merely smells their “pleasing odor” (<italic>rêaḥ nîḥōaḥ</italic>).13 On the other hand, God’s presence resides in the tent continuously (Num. 9:15–23)—the source of an ongoing theophany.14 Located at the very heart of the Israelite camp (Numbers 2), it constitutes what Eliade would call a “sacred center” (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 20–65), which, as we will see, appears to be more or less directly inherited from ancient Near Eastern traditions.15</p>
      <p>P’s notion of sacred space comes into proper perspective when compared with the Elohist’s (E).16 E locates the tent of meeting some distance outside the camp (Exod. 33:7). God does not dwell in this structure but makes brief, occasional appearances there, descending in a “pillar of cloud” at its entrance in order to speak with Moses (Exod. 33:9). While P’s “cloud” permanently installs itself atop the tent (Num. 9:15–23), simultaneously obscuring and signifying the divine presence within, E’s “pillar of cloud” in effect permanently anchors God’s apparition to the transcendent realm, an indication of the fleeting nature of this divine intrusion into time and space. Thus, as soon as these meetings end, the pillar immediately retracts heavenward, as God forsakes the earthly plane (Num. 12:9–10). The underlying idea is that God is transcendent, has no proper place in the material world—what Jonathan Z. Smith aptly describes as “utopian.”17 Noting this contrast, scholars have misidentified P’s God as “immanent.”18 Even Knohl, though sensitive to P’s inherent tension, wrongly attempts to resolve it merely by differentiating between the concepts of transcendence and abstraction: “It is important to stress that the opposition between God’s immanence in the priestly tradition and His transcendence in [E’s] prophetic approach has no connection to the issue of abstraction and corporeality.”19 It is misleading, however, to characterize P’s divine presence as “immanent.” Both P and E have a transcendent—nonmaterial—view of God.20 They merely represent two contradictory surface expressions of the same underlying concept. This common epistemic ground accounts for the telling complementary distribution of divine properties between E and P: P’s God is constantly present but abstract and impersonal; E’s largely absent God speaks to Moses “face to face” (Exod. 33:11). In both cases, one quality compensates for the other’s lack; this lack prevents God from becoming too “present” or accessible.</p>
      <p>It is at this deeper epistemic level that we can properly discern the historical and discursive relationships between P’s tent and its precursors. P’s metaphysical reinterpretation of the divine has led to the transformation, specifically, the historicization, of the ancient Near Eastern mythical construction of sacred space. God’s <italic>kābôd</italic> may dwell permanently in a type of sacred center, but this presence is not an instantiation of mythical immanence, according to which a god—Marduk, for example—comes to inhabit his home in the mythic past, <italic>in illo tempore</italic>. Rather, P’s God can enter his home only “in this time” (<italic>hoc tempore</italic>), that is, history, precisely because of the metaphysical divide that must first be overcome but not thereby negated. Over against mythical immanence, then, we should counterpose the superficially analogous but profoundly distinct idea of “historical presence.”</p>
      <p>In other words, an epistemic break separates pagan myth from biblical narrative. In order to uncover this break and discover its significance, we must undertake what Michel Foucault has called an “archaeology of knowledge.”21 As part of this historical‐epistemological project—a merely preliminary “excavation”—I will define two pairs of opposed ideas: immanence and transcendence, myth and history. What separates these two sets of ideas is a sudden mutation in thought, namely, the emergence of the metaphysical dualism of spirit and matter.22 It is this dualism that constitutes the defining break of the Israelite episteme. This rupture will lead us in turn to posit a radical shift in the concept of the sacred itself. Finally, in light of this “archaeological” survey, I will briefly analyze P’s history, from the creation of the world to the construction of the tent, in its radical difference from the mythic account of the corresponding events found in <italic>Enuma Elish</italic>. Let us begin, however, with a brief description of Foucault’s project and its relevance to the history of ancient Israelite religion and thought in order to establish a minimal framework within which to proceed with the analysis.</p>

               <p>Mircea Eliade, <italic>The Myth of the Eternal Return</italic> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1954). While my use of Eliade will be readily apparent in what follows, I partly revise his theory and partly reveal what I consider to be the underlying significance of his work—which is not always clear or entirely consistent. In particular, I reinterpret his ideas in light of two related dichotomies (defined later in this study): immanence and transcendence, myth and history. Eliade’s concept of transcendence simply refers to the sacred as revealed in myth: “The world of axiomatic spiritual values … [is] ‘transcendent’ in the sense that they are revealed by divine beings or mythical ancestors” (“Structures and Changes in the History of Religion,” in <italic>City Invincible</italic>, ed. C. H. Kraeling and R. M. Adams [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960], 366; see also Mircea Eliade, <italic>The Sacred and the Profane</italic> [San Diego, CA: Harcourt Brace, 1959], 34, 116–19; hereafter cited as <italic>S&amp;P</italic>). His notion of the sacred, in turn, revises Rudolf Otto’s idea of the “numinous” in such a way as to encompass the rational as well as irrational dimension of the divine (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 8–10). Myth and history are categories Eliade uses inconsistently: Judaism and Christianity are at one moment historical religions, but at the next they provide examples of myth. As is well known, Eliade has been criticized in various ways. Jonathan Z. Smith’s work is especially relevant here. He convincingly argues against Eliade’s historical thesis that the “archaic” center precedes other conceptions of sacred space and experience, namely, chaos and the periphery (<italic>Map Is Not Territory</italic> [Leiden: Brill, 1978], 88–103, 289–309, and <italic>To Take Place</italic> [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987], 1–23). Smith, however, unadvisedly generalizes this particular case into a universal rejection of historical development in (religious) thought: “Is the material Eliade describes best organized under the categories ‘archaic’ and ‘modern’? … We must be careful to … resist imposing even an implicit evolutionary scheme of development ‘from closed world to the infinite universe’ (to borrow the title of Alexander [<italic>sic</italic>] Koyré’s well‐known work)” (<italic>Map Is Not Territory</italic>, 100–101). Ironically, his reference to Koyré goes to the heart of the matter. Ultimately, modern science—“Galilean,” to use Koyré’s term—demonstrates that knowledge does in fact “evolve.” If religion is not science, it is nonetheless plausible that certain ideas, in religion as elsewhere, are relatively “natural” or “intuitive” and thus make their appearance before others that are “artificial” and “acquired” by comparison. Note, however, that the new doesn’t entirely replace or supplant the old in a purely linear succession: not all ideas held in the modern world, e.g., are “modern,” namely, take account of Galilean science.</p>

               <p>To seek in the great accumulation of the already‐said the text that resembles “in advance” a later text, to ransack history in order to rediscover the play of anticipations or echoes, to go right back to the first seeds or to go forward to the last traces, to reveal in a work its fidelity to tradition or its irreducible uniqueness, … these are harmless enough amusements for historians who refuse to grow up. (Foucault, <italic>Archaeology of Knowledge</italic>, 144)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>While one can identify shifts in emphasis and terminology in the course of Foucault’s career, his oeuvre bears witness to a sustained engagement with a certain style of historical analysis: the history of insanity, of the medical sciences, of the human sciences, of the prison, of sexuality.23 Whether under the aegis of “archaeology,” “genealogy,” or the “technologies of the self,” he consistently sought to uncover certain crucial “breaks” or “ruptures” within the history of knowledge. Rather than study the gradual, continuous evolution of certain terms—the domain of traditional intellectual history, the history of ideas—he sought to discover those discrete “discursive formations” or “epistemes” underlying, indeed, constituting knowledge. In this respect, Foucault takes his place in a venerable tradition within French philosophy, relatively unknown among Anglo‐American scholars, which attempted to formulate a theory of these ruptures or breaks. Here we encounter names both familiar—Louis Althusser, Gaston Bachelard, Jacques Lacan—and, perhaps, less familiar—Georges Canguilhem, Alexandre Kojève, Alexandre Koyré.24 As Milner has recently observed, it is against this philosophical tradition that we can properly gauge Foucault’s significance as “a sort of crowning achievement of the French school of thought, since he sought to construct (and in my opinion succeeded) a general theory … of cuts in thought.”25</p>
         <p>The centrality to Foucault’s work of these “cuts in thought”—namely, epistemic breaks or ruptures—Milner captures in his formulation of what he identifies as “Foucault’s thesis”: “There are cuts in thought such that there is absolutely no synonymy between the two sides of the cut.”26 In other words, the apparent continuity of lexical terms as they gradually evolve through time obscures the profound conceptual differences actually separating their various usages. Epistemologically speaking, these different usages are not “synonyms” but “homonyms.”27 As Canguilhem has relatedly observed apropos of the history of the life sciences, one must replace the naive notion of the lexical “term” with the critical idea of the “concept”: “The historian should not make the error of thinking that persistent use of a particular term indicates an invariant underlying concept or that persistent allusion to similar experimental observations connotes affinities of method or approach.”28 Ultimately, Foucault’s archaeology does not deal with “language,” but with “discourse.” A language consists of a lexicon—a set of words—and a grammar—a set of rules capable of generating the infinite set of potential and actual sentences judged by native speakers to be “grammatical.” While discourse is analogous to language and to some extent consists in it, they do not coincide. Instead of words and sentences we uncover “concepts” and “statements.” And instead of the rules of grammar we uncover discursive laws for the construction of the strictly finite set of “statements” actually “enunciated” within a given discursive formation or “episteme”—what Milner succinctly glosses as “the system of production of statements that is characteristic of a certain discourse configuration.”29 Language, then, comprises what can be said or written, discourse, what was actually thought.</p>
         <p>Foucault’s project has profound implications for the study of ancient Israelite religion, especially its relation to the ancient Near East. While an earlier generation of scholars—Yehezkel Kaufmann and G. Ernest Wright, especially—recognized the break separating Israelite religion from its ancient Near Eastern context,30 subsequent scholarship raised various objections against their work, in particular, the undeniable contention that their work was shaped and ultimately distorted by theological apologetic.31 In the wake of such criticisms, there has been a marked tendency to avoid the “revolutionary” interpretation of biblical religion in favor of an “evolutionary” approach to the problem.32 The presence of apology, however, does not free scholars from the burden of determining the truth of the matter—the apologists could be right, in spite of their biases. Moreover, there is nothing inherently theological or apologetic in the idea of revolution as such—as Foucault amply demonstrates. One can construct, in other words, a purely secular account of the Israelite epistemic break. What is needed is an archaeological analysis of the biblical episteme. For it solves problems inherent in and encountered by earlier accounts of the so‐called distinctiveness of Israelite religion.</p>
         <p>Archaeology is secular or agnostic because it makes no evaluative pronouncements. It analyzes the history of knowledge as such, without regard for the truth or falsity of the (theological) propositions under consideration: “I am not concerned, therefore, to describe the progress of knowledge towards an objectivity in which today’s science can finally be recognized; what I am attempting to bring to light is the epistemological field, the <italic>episteme</italic> in which knowledge, envisaged apart from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its objective forms, grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather that of its conditions of possibility.”33 Thus, if I credit ancient Israelite thinkers with certain intellectual achievements, these will not point to the superiority of biblical religion, to its greater truth value. By the same logic, Israel may be distinct, but it is not inherently unique (revealed Truth). It is by mere historical accident the locus of an event in the history of thought. This event could just as easily have taken place elsewhere in addition to, or instead of, Israel. My theory therefore accommodates Julius Wellhausen’s discovery of “monotheism” in Israel’s immediate environs: “Moab, Ammon, and Edom, Israel’s nearest kinsfolk and neighbours, were monotheists in precisely the same sense in which Israel itself was.”34 In fact, we discover analogous developments in ancient Greece.35 Ultimately, we should probably place biblical religion in that set of roughly contemporaneous events known as “the Axial Age.”36 Conversely, not all “statements” in ancient Israel or even in the Bible need belong to a single episteme—segments of Israel were no doubt “pagan.” But this study cannot address all the biblical sources, much less all the presumed “strata” of Israelite culture and society—the so‐called popular religion, for example.</p>
         <p>To admit of plural epistemes, however, is not to seek after their proliferation. Discursive formations are by their very nature “rare.” Applying a version of “Occam’s razor,” we should posit as few epistemes as possible to account for the evidence, namely, the set of relevant statements. This is an especially important point, given the empiricist, nominalist tendencies of Anglo‐American scholarship—encountered in that ubiquitous a priori criticism admonishing scholars to “nuance,” “complicate,” and so forth.37 If the nominalist‐empiricist position has assumed an axiomatic status for some, one can nevertheless just as reasonably occupy another epistemological stance: “Platonic realism,” for example, which maintains that true knowledge rejects the phenomenal (empiricist) world in favor of the noumenal world of forms.38 From this perspective, “nuance” and “complication” ultimately entail the rejection of rigorous formal thought. There is precisely in this regard a certain Platonism in Foucault’s project. For it discovers within the apparent continuity of discourse a small number of discrete, nontemporal forms—not empiricist complication but abstract elegance. To return to the analogy between discourse and language, what separates one discursive formation from another is not some finely graduated spectrum of significations but a distinct and definite boundary—such as that between German and French, for example—whose traversal, if at all possible, would require something like a discursive “translation.” It does not suffice, then, to reject on a priori grounds the hypothesis that biblical religion and paganism constitute two discrete forms. And if “monotheism”—a nonce term I shall shortly reject—does not cease to evolve within ancient Israel, its identifiable stages do not necessarily constitute so many epistemes.39 For apparent contradictions between statements often merely reflect the different possibilities generated by a single set of discursive rules—as we saw earlier in the case of P and E.</p>
         <p>For this reason, archaeology provides a crucial alternative to the history‐of‐ideas approach that has characterized the study of Israelite religion within the ancient Near East. The search for precursors, so dear to biblicists, will always only discover continuity, thereby obscuring the ruptures of history. The apparent synonyms—parallels and cognates—found in Ugarit, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere, are in fact mere homonyms. “God,” for instance, is a concept constructed within particular epistemes, not some fixed lexical term with a stable if gradually evolving content. If this is so, then biblical references to God who “sits on the cherubs” (1 Sam. 4:4, 2 Sam. 6:2, 2 Kings 19:15, Isa. 37:16, 1 Chron. 13:6) may bear a merely superficial resemblance to the Ugaritic designation of Baal as the “Cloudrider.” Similarly, in the much discussed incident in Gen. 6:1–4, “the sons of godkind” is a mere homonym of “the sons of El” in the Ugaritic pantheon.40 For a dualist system of thought constitutes a discrete discursive formation. It brings with it a new set of concepts and statements about a transcendent God and about history. To seek merely “the play of anticipations or echoes” may be “harmless enough amusements,” but it is also to accept in advance the very limitations Foucault sought to overcome. If one is free in the end to reject his peculiar style of analysis, we should at least allow archaeology to run its course before retreating to the familiar terrain of traditional intellectual history—lest we be accused of being “historians who refuse to grow up.”</p>

               <p>One of the most convincing aspects of the mystic illumination is the apparent revelation of the oneness of all things, giving rise to pantheism in religion, and to monism in philosophy. (Bertrand Russell, <italic>Mysticism and Logic</italic>, 17)</p>

         </p>
         <p>In its precise, technical sense, “transcendence” refers to nonmateriality—god‐as‐spirit “transcends” the physical universe. It provides the precise counterpart to the notion of “immanence”—an “immanent” god exists within the cosmos. If the idea of transcendent deity has become a natural intuition in the modern (i.e., post‐Cartesian) West, the immanent conception of divinity has fallen into obscurity and misunderstanding. It coincides neither with anthropomorphism nor with personification. Anthropomorphism is a mode of description, which need not imply actual materiality of the divine, as Plato, for example, recognized long ago: “There is not a single sound reason for positing the existence of such a being who is immortal, but because we have never seen or formed an adequate idea of god, we picture him to ourselves as being of the same kind as ourselves but immortal, a combination of soul and body indissolubly joined for ever.”41 It may function merely as a metaphorical convenience, a literary conceit. Such is the case with E in the passages mentioned above: God is transcendent but nevertheless makes brief occasional appearances on earth in anthropomorphic form.42 Personification, on the other hand, signifies too narrow an idea. While any god that personifies some aspect of nature is necessarily immanent, not all immanent gods are “mere” personifications.43</p>
         <p>What is crucial to immanence as such is metaphysical monism: the idea that a single continuum, the cosmos, comprises everything—humans, gods, and nature—hence Eliade’s description of the cosmos as “a living and articulated unity” (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 94).44 There is no transcendent realm outside the cosmos for a “hidden god.”45 The notion of transcendence presupposes instead the metaphysical dualism of spirit and matter. The cosmos now gives way to the physical universe (matter), defined in opposition to the transcendent (spirit). In a monistic cosmos, the one principle in which all consists is neither quite spirit nor matter. For it is only in a dualism that these two metaphysical principles constitute each other in their mutual opposition. In this way, the transcendent god or gods—we are not talking about monotheism here—and the physical universe effectively create each other as spirit and matter, respectively, in their very opposition.46 Whether humankind is a dual entity (as Descartes would later claim) is secondary, and need not concern us here. Metaphysical dualism constitutes nothing less than a revolution in knowledge‐thought. This break transforms not only the conception of the gods but the apprehension of time, space, and the sacred itself as well.47</p>

            <disp-quote>
               <p>From one point of view, the whole history of art may be summed up as the history of the gradual discovery of appearances. Primitive art starts … with symbols of concepts. … Gradually the symbolism approximates more and more to actual appearance. … Indeed, it has taken from Neolithic times till the nineteenth century to perfect this discovery … in which the discovery of linear perspective marks an important stage. (Roger Fry, <italic>Reflections on British Painting</italic>, 134–35)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Scholars have long attributed historical thought to the Bible, but they have failed to provide an adequate definition for the concept of history itself, merely taking it for granted as some sort of intuitive, commonsensical notion.48 In fact, history is not an innate or natural idea but one that must be constituted through human reflection on time and space.49 In other words, thought or knowledge, like art, has a history, one that does not merely comprise a set of events arbitrarily distributed in time but constitutes a series as well. Certain concepts, that is, necessarily appear after others. This follows from the observable fact, curiously fallen into disrepute, that over the course of the millennia thought has developed—if not always for the better. One may thus justifiably distinguish earlier from later forms of thought.50 From one point of view, we might characterize this history of knowledge as the “gradual discovery of appearances,” where appearances are defined in opposition to some eternal realm—Israel’s God, Plato’s forms. If “primitive” thought begins with a “symbol of the concept”—let us call this “myth”—“historical” thought becomes possible when knowledge takes cognizance of “appearances” as such. One need only add to Fry’s formulation that this “gradual discovery” is punctuated by several crucial breaks. In the history of art, one such rupture is the discovery of linear perspective, which marks the entry of dualism—perceiving subject versus object’s appearance—into art.51 In that of knowledge, one such break is the conception of history. Like linear perspective, properly historical thought constitutes a dualism: historical (temporal) contingence versus (eternal) necessity.52 For this very reason, one cannot dismiss the distinction between myth and history merely by discovering in myth traces of what we would call “historical events.”53 What does it mean to constitute history as an object of knowledge? What is its essential difference from myth?</p>
         <p>Myth, according to Eliade, takes place in what he famously refers to as <italic>illud tempus</italic>, “that time” (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 68–113).54 That time, as such, is a qualitatively different time having no linear connection to the present: “This primordial situation is not historical, it is not calculable chronologically; what is involved is a mythical anteriority, the time of origin, what took place ‘in the beginning,’ <italic>in principio</italic>” (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 92).55 It is, as R. G. Collingwood similarly remarks, “a dateless past … outside all our time‐reckonings.”56 The remoteness of this past, in other words, does not express itself as a linear distance from the present along a horizontal temporal axis. It is not “lost,” as is the Proustian past, in the inaccessible horizon of history. Rather, the mythical past persists within the present, underlies it along what we might imagine as a vertical axis. Mythical time is thus recoverable, repeatable, cyclical.57 It is, as Collingwood observes, “quasi‐temporal”: “The narrator is using the language of time‐succession as a metaphor in which to express relations which he does not conceive as really temporal [namely,] … the relations between various gods or various elements of the divine nature.”58 Quasi‐temporal, because myth does not measure out the linear sequence of the clock, what Bertrand Russell calls “physical time.”59 Rather, mythic time comprises the time of the gods (<italic>illud tempus</italic>) and human reality within its closed circle, an analogue for what the philosophers call “being.”60 Not being in the strict sense, however, which is already a dualist concept, constituted as such only in opposition to “existence.” True being is nontemporal, representable as a single point, whereas mythic time as a circle has a certain temporal extension or duration, namely, a period. Rather, myth as a form of narration‐knowledge takes as its object a monistic approximation of being. In other words, the mythic past does not precede the present as cause to effect but, rather, grounds it as its essence, its paradigm. For inasmuch as the past having once occurred is in a sense logically “necessary,” that is, irrevocable—the past is “the most tragic tense,” according to F. L. Lucas61—the events communicated in myth could not, from the perspective of human reality, be other than they are. They are always already past. The mythic past in this way comprises the realm of necessity—the underlying significance of Eliade’s crucial concept, <italic>illud tempus</italic>. Myth, in other words, apprehends within the cosmos that which is eternal, necessary, essential.62</p>
         <p>History, in contrast to myth, takes place “in this time,” <italic>hoc tempore</italic>, that is, in time as such (existence), now properly defined in opposition to eternity (being). The historical past is “homogeneous” with the present, for both locate themselves along a single horizontal axis.63 Historical time is thus linear, unrepeatable, irrecoverable. The historical past is “lost” in the Proustian formula, belongs to what Bertrand Russell calls “physical time.” It precedes the present as cause to effect—horizontal causation, not vertical paradigm. History, in other words, is genuinely temporal, and history as a mode of knowledge apprehends existence, the realm of the temporal, the contingent, the accidental. True, historical events, not unlike mythic events, cannot be changed once they have taken place—the historical past is still “necessary.” But the events of history, unlike those of myth, were at some point “in this time” still in the process of becoming, still in the future, finally taking place only as the accidental outcome of various contingent forces, however these are imagined—divine, human, natural. History, unlike myth, could have turned out other than it is. It therefore constitutes a radically new way of perceiving and conceiving of reality—reality as empirical. Thus, for Eliade, the metaphysical transformation of myth into history distinguishes historical religions such as Judaism and Christianity from what he refers to as “primitive,” “archaic” (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 106), and even “pre‐Mosaic” (105) religions: “Judaism presents an innovation of the first importance. For Judaism, time has a beginning and will have an end. The idea of cyclic time is left behind” (110).64 More precisely, historical thought replaces the closed circle of mythic quasi‐time, a monism (fig. 1), with a dualism, namely, linear historical time (existence) defined in opposition to eternity (being), which we now represent as a single ideal point transcending (lying outside of) time (fig. 2).65<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>Now the dualism of being and existence is homologous to that between spirit and matter. Myth and history are premised, respectively, on monism and dualism. Within mythical thought, being (the divine) is immanent within the cosmos, so that the mythical past provides paradigms that are said to be “reactualized” through the human gesture of <italic>imitatio dei</italic>: “The supreme function of the myth is to ‘fix’ the paradigmatic models for all rites and all significant human activities—eating, sexuality, work, education, and so on” (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 98). Only by corresponding to immortal paradigms are mortal acts “at once <italic>real</italic> and <italic>significant</italic>” (96; emphasis his). Myth is thus structured as a repetition—principle of the same, the one—whence Eliade’s “eternal return.”66 The cosmos is, in effect, “mapped onto” an endlessly repeating cycle. As a result, the reactualization of myth, which unites divine and human reality in an act of <italic>imitatio dei</italic>, constitutes what philosophers call an “internal relation.”67 In terms of figure 1, this internal relation joins two distinct points in time that coincide because of mythic time’s circular shape. Strictly speaking, then, myth knows nothing of existence—historical time and space—which has not yet been constituted as an object of knowledge. Historical thought—knowledge of time, contingence, accidence—only becomes possible when a distinction is drawn between the transcendent realm of being and the immanent realm of existence.68 In historical religions, being takes the form of transcendent divinity and is alienated as such from the physical universe. In other words, the circle of myth (fig. 1) is “broken” and transformed into a dualist system (fig. 2):69 a horizontal line (time) and a point (eternity).70 The physical universe is now mapped onto the horizontal axis of history. In this new configuration, the past cannot be repeated or reactualized, only commemorated.71 For each historical event is unique, corresponding to a single point on the axis of time, and every relation between historical events, and between eternity and time as such, is now “external.” History, in contrast to myth, is structured by the principle of difference—the difference of being and existence and of past and present.72</p>
         <p>The point of distinguishing between myth and history is not that members of “archaic” societies did not experience and perceive the passage of linear time—at the very least in the ineluctable process of aging and dying—nor that history did not take place in antiquity—witness the great empires of Egypt and Mesopotamia. It is that myth as a system of knowledge apprehends the cosmos as a monistic structure of eternal, necessary essences.73 Nor is the point that the mythical apprehension of reality is inherently deficient as a mode of thought. For in a sense, modern science, too, seeks to discover what is, in effect, being, namely, the eternal, necessary and essential in nature: the so‐called universal and immutable laws of science.74</p>

               <p>Myth and history correspond to two philosophical systems of knowledge. In his essay, “The Monistic Theory of Truth” (in <italic>Philosophical Essays</italic> [London: Routledge, 1994], 131–46), Bertrand Russell claims that ontological monism—“the doctrine that Reality is one” (131)—is premised on the “axiom of internal relations”: “Every relation is grounded in the natures of the related terms” (139). That is, in a monism, any two related terms share “identity in difference” (137). This theory of truth Russell ascribes to F. H. Bradley’s “absolute idealism”—see, e.g., Bradley, <italic>Appearance and Reality</italic>, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1897), and <italic>Essays on Truth and Reality</italic> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1914). Bradley’s theory of “truth and reality” is, in effect, a monistic epistemology. Russell’s realism (and realism in general), conversely, is premised on dualism and the axiom of external relations. For a general discussion of internal and external relations, see Richard M. Rorty, “Relations, Internal and External,” in <italic>The Encyclopedia of Philosophy</italic>, 8 vols., ed.

               <p>Analogous to Fry’s history of art, I am proposing that mythical thought necessarily precedes historical thought—more generally, that certain ideas (innate, e.g.) naturally precede others. Descartes, for instance, makes the perhaps counterintuitive claim: “I must not think that my conception of the infinite has come about, not through a proper idea, but by a denial of the finite. … My primary concept is rather of the infinite than of the finite” (Descartes, <italic>Philosophical Writings</italic>, trans. Elizabeth Anscombe and Peter Thomas Geach [New York: Macmillan, 1971], 85). Note, the infinite (the Cartesian God) corresponds to being and eternity, the finite to existence and time, so that his proposal is analogous to my historical thesis placing myth before history.</p>

This would seem to be what Kojève has in mind when he claims that “Realism is necessarily dualist, and that an ontological dualism is always ‘realist’” (<italic>Introduction to the Reading of Hegel</italic>, 154); and that “‘Realism’ in philosophy means, finally, nothing but ‘Historicism’” (156). A monistic version of history is perhaps also conceivable—Hegel comes to mind—but Hegel’s would be a secondary monism—i.e., based on the prior existence and rejection of dualism—which is quite different from that situation preceding the initial appearance of dualism. Incidentally, if Kojève is right, Hegel is not truly an idealist (monist) but a realist and hence a dualist (150).</p>

               <p>I have always asked myself if holiness, that is, separation or purity, the essence without admixture that can be called Spirit and which animates the Jewish tradition—or to which the Jewish tradition aspires—can dwell in a world that has not been desacralized. (Emmanuel Levinas, <italic>Nine Talmudic Readings</italic>, 141)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>All religious beliefs, according to Emile Durkheim, “presuppose a classification of all the things, real and ideal, of which men think, into two classes or opposed groups,” namely, the sacred and the profane.75 Now the sacred is none other than the principle of being, whether the latter is conceived of as the divine, the totemic mana, or the animating power of the fetish.76 It stands to reason, then, that the concept of the sacred will depend upon the concept of being‐divinity. In fact, the standard opposition between sacred (being) and profane (existence)—presupposed by Durkheim, Eliade, and others—is already dualist. We must therefore differentiate between two homonyms: “sacred” as a mythical concept and “sacred” as a historical concept.77 Specifically, we must distinguish between mythical “manifestations” and the historical “encounter.”</p>
         <p>Within mythical religions, being (divinity) is immanent to the cosmos. The source of the sacred is thus to be found within the cosmos itself, namely, within those mythic “paradigms” established by the gods’ creative acts <italic>in illo tempore</italic>—what Eliade calls “sacred history.”78 It is by virtue of their participation in this sacred history that certain points in space and time become “manifestations” of the sacred. Because these manifestations are established in “that time,” their sacredness is conceived of as a necessary and eternal essence. Relatedly, the locus of the sacred is fixed or embedded within the structure of the cosmos, typically as key natural phenomena that originate in the time of the gods. Within a mythical framework, humans realize or experience the sacred by reactualizing these manifestations, establishing, in effect, an internal relation between human reality and the divine. Thus, according to Eliade, sacred space is “a primordial experience, homologizable to a founding of the world” (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 20–21); similarly, sacred time “represents the reactualization of a sacred event that took place in a mythical past” (68–69). As a monism, myth does not, strictly speaking, define sacred in opposition to profane—a dualist conception—but as being in opposition to nonbeing—the relative presence or absence of a single metaphysical principle.79 For this reason, Eliade, who, to be sure, differs on this point, speaks of the “ontological thirst” (<italic>S&amp;P</italic>, 64) or “ontological obsession” (94) of archaic religion, of the “absolute reality” of the sacred and the “nonreality” of the profane (21). In a sense, then, nothing is truly profane—namely, having existence to the exclusion of being—but rather more or less “real,” more or less “reactualized.”</p>
         <p>In historical religion, being now transcends the physical universe. The sacred can therefore come about only through the intrusion of being into existence, in other words, through a historical “encounter,” one that occurs in “this time” and could therefore fail to take place.80 The “sacred history” recounting this encounter is now properly historical. If certain points in time and space still acquire sacredness due to the role they play in this history, this sacredness is now conceived of as a contingent, temporal accident. As a result, sacred time and space become detached from natural manifestations and attached, by convention, to certain historical events.81 Humans now participate in this conception of the sacred, not by reactualizing mythic paradigms in cyclical time—an internal relation—but by commemorating the encounter in the linear time of history—an external relation. Finally, since historical thought is a dualist system of knowledge premised on the opposition of being and existence, it defines the sacred (being) in opposition to a genuine idea of the profane (existence). The “disenchanted,” “desacralized” universe now consists of profane substance; sacredness is now an accidental attribute acquired by those points of profane reality that are “sanctified,” “consecrated,” set apart as “holy.”</p>

         </p>
         <p>We are finally in a position to analyze <italic>Enuma Elish</italic> and P’s “Creation History” and the epistemic break that separates the two. The former operates according to the discursive concepts and rules of a pagan‐mythic episteme—immanence, mythic necessity, the sacred manifestation—the latter according to the concepts and rules of a religiohistorical episteme—transcendence, historical contingence, the sacred encounter. Only after this archaeological analysis can we, in conclusion, return to the question I raised at the very beginning of this essay: if P’s God is not immanent, what is the nature of this divine “historical presence” achieved in and through the Priestly tent of meeting?</p>
         <p>According to the Mesopotamian creation myth, <italic>Enuma Elish</italic>, the cosmos begins in the form of the primordial sweet and salt waters, personified, respectively, as Apsu and Tiamat (I:1–4).82 Together they form a hypostasis of the cosmos as a monism. Everything—natural, human, and divine—will derive from their waters. They epitomize the idea of immanent deity, for they not only exist within, but are coexstensive with, the cosmos.83 In fact, this myth conceives of a number of deities as personifications of various aspects of nature. Apsu and Tiamat represent the sweet (river) and salt (sea) waters, respectively, just as their first offspring, Lahmu and Lahamu, represent earth in the form of alluvial silt (I:5–10). Much later, Marduk, by exerting control over air and fire in his elemental battle against Tiamat and her chthonic cohort, distending her belly and dividing her corpse in half in order to create the world, personifies the storm, which rules over water and, indeed, appropriates it as rain (IV:93–104, 128–40);84 more generally, he symbolizes that dry realm of earth, fire, and air that maintains life‐sustaining order between the two halves of Tiamat’s corpse, the heavens and the deep—evidence of a primordial conflict.85 But he, in his role as creator, rises above such a function. The notion of divine immanence, in other words, in no way contradicts the fact that the gods can exceed the personification of nature and thus surpass mundane reality. As Kaufmann recognized, “the concept of a god who is creator, eternal, benign, or even all‐powerful … [is] found everywhere in the pagan world.”86</p>
         <p>Paganism, then, is not an inherently inferior system for imagining the divine; it is merely an alternate metaphysical conception. The physical existence imputed to pagan gods does not, as Kaufmann would have it, signify their “limitations.”87 Rather, it typically functions as part of an implicit, incipient theory of the natural world. Thus, in <italic>Enuma Elish</italic>, the primordial waters constitute that first element from which all else descends.88 Earth comes next, in the form of the second generation deities, Lahmu and Lahamu. Fire and air appear belatedly with Marduk’s rise to power, but by that very fact they come to rule over the archaic principles of earth and water. The order of elements seems to follow the ascending hierarchy visible in the cosmos: from ocean to dry land to sky (air and fire). Alongside the elements, the myth posits a creative principle: the force of attraction, figured as sexual desire, provides the primitive force animating the cosmogonic process.89 Without <italic>eros</italic>, Tiamat and Apsu would never have “mingled” their waters, nothing would have disturbed or changed their initial state, and none of the subsequent generations of gods or the world itself would have come into being. The younger gods, the result of sexual congress, similarly disturb the primordial gods, who after procreating have achieved divine rest, thus leading to further changes in the cosmic order. In other words, “noise” and “rest” constitute mythemes, respectively, for dynamis and stasis. Apsu’s—and later Tiamat’s—desire for rest, far from indicating divine irritability and indolence, symbolizes cosmic balance or <italic>stasis</italic>; the noise that deprives the older gods of sleep is not so much a token of rebellion, as a mythic representation of cosmic change or <italic>dynamis</italic>.90 In order for the cosmos to assume a stable form, noise must eventually be overcome by sleep. And so, when Marduk finally assumes rule and comes to rest in his sanctuary, the cosmos reaches its ultimate stasis. <italic>Atrahasis</italic>, too, explains how the cosmos achieved a stable and permanent balance.91 Both the rebellion of the Igigi against the Anunaki and the growing disturbance caused by human overpopulation are described in terms of “cries” (<italic>rigmu</italic>) and “din” (<italic>ḫubūru</italic>) because both upset the cosmic balance between two classes of beings.92 The first results in a new stasis achieved through the creation of humans; the second maintains that stasis by diminishing human reproductive potential. There is no human rebellion against the gods, and in curbing human fecundity, the gods do not so much punish them as secure a workable balance between mortals and immortals—as opposed to altogether destroying humankind, which would only recapitulate the labor crisis humans were created to resolve.</p>
         <p>In P’s creation account (Gen. 1:1–2:4a), we find a wholly different understanding of God and the physical universe. While it demonstrably derives, at least in part, from those very traditions underlying <italic>Enuma Elish</italic>, a radical transformation has taken place.93 Not unlike the Mesopotamian myth, the material world begins as primordial waters, “the deep” (<italic>tĕhôm</italic>), which replaces Tiamat and Apsu—personifications are purged from this account. This primordial ocean literally comprises the imagined physical universe: like Tiamat’s corpse, it is split in two, and between its halves are found sky, land, sea, and all their teeming life. P does not, however, describe a monistic cosmos. For over against matter (the deep) hovers “the wind of God” (1:2). This wind is a manifestation “of” or “from” God, but, as grammar makes clear, it is not equivalent to God. Neither is it a second material element, such as Marduk used to defeat the archaic mother‐goddess. It constitutes instead a second, wholly other principle, outside of and opposed to matter. It symbolizes God’s transcendence.94 The opposition of divine wind and primordial deep is a hypostasis of the dualism of spirit and matter. The concept of the divine presence in P (<italic>kābôd</italic>) must be understood in reference to this primary dualism.</p>
         <p>Instead of cosmogony, then, we find creation: God merely acts upon inert matter. There is no substantive interchange between the two, for they are mutually incompatible. Creating the physical universe from without, however, does not make Yahweh a more powerful deity—Marduk is, for all intents and purposes, omnipotent. Genesis 1 simply apprehends a different metaphysical relationship between the God of Israel and nature. As a result, P’s creation history does not offer an incipient theory of nature, as does <italic>Enuma Elish</italic>. That is, the distinctions and divisions God draws within matter are not mythic “manifestations” of the divine nature, nor does God personify or otherwise symbolize the physical universe as a system. Rather, the symmetry and order of the created world are “inscriptions” of divine will onto material world—an external rather than internal relation. As a result, this nature can be “read,” as when P interprets the rainbow as a “sign” (<italic>ʾôt</italic>) of the Noahic covenant (Gen. 9:8–17)—not the natural manifestation of divine paradigm but the conventional signifier of God’s intention. For the same reason, this creation can be evaluated, namely, as “good” (Gen. 1:4, etc.), which logically entails the possibility of the world being other than it is—“corrupt” (6:12), for example. In other words, reality is no longer the realm of mythic necessity but of historical contingence.</p>
         <p>Returning to <italic>Enuma Elish</italic>, we see that it takes place in that qualitatively different time, <italic>illud tempus</italic>.95 It begins with the primordial waters, Apsu and Tiamat, and concludes with the creation of Babylon and Marduk’s temple by the hands of the gods (IV:135–46). Humans arrive only at the end of the story (VI:1–34), as Marduk comes to rule over the gods, rests in his palace‐temple, and establishes cosmic stasis (VI:35–73), since human reality cannot come into being until the time of myth has completed its circuit. Marduk’s final rest marks that sense of an ending crucial to Eliade’s understanding of mythic time: “Any mythology that is still accessible in an appropriate form contains not only a beginning but also an end, determined by the last manifestation of the supernatural beings, the cultural heroes or the ancestors.”96 All that transpires before this break or rupture constitutes that realm of necessity that is the mythic cosmos. Thus, even though <italic>Enuma Elish</italic> registers the ascendance of Babylon as a political entity—reflects, in other words, what we would call a historical event—it tellingly projects this event into the primordial past, thus apprehending the rise of this “center of religion” as an eternal, necessary, and essential part of the cosmos.</p>
         <p>The absolute rupture between that time and this becomes even clearer in <italic>Gilgamesh</italic>, in the hero’s encounter with Utnapishtim. In a sense, we witness here the encounter of the epic and mythic pasts.97 The flood story narrated by Utnapishtim, like <italic>Atrahasis</italic>, ends with final stasis of humankind vis‐à‐vis godkind, as the gods transform “primitive” humans into the less potent version we find in present reality. This stasis marks the end of mythical time. What is interesting is that it is already inaccessible even to Gilgamesh, two‐thirds divine: “So now, who can gather the gods on your behalf, (Gilgamesh), / That you too may find eternal life which you seek?” (11.197–98).98 The mythic time of divine assemblies, Utnapishtim wistfully observes, is over; changes in the cosmic order are no longer possible. We find an even more developed confrontation of temporal orders in Hesiod’s account of the five races. Here, Hesiod sings of a succession of ages: gold, silver, bronze, heroic, iron. This is an apparent linear succession, but each age is qualitatively different, one from the next, that time from this. As Jean‐Pierre Vernant remarks, with the unacknowledged but unmistakable influence of Eliade: “If the race of gold is called ‘the first,’ it is not because it arose one fine day, before the others, in the course of linear and irreversible time. … It embodies virtues—symbolized by gold—which are at the top of a scale of nontemporal values. The succession of the races in time reflects a permanent, hierarchical order in the universe.”99</p>
         <p>The plot of P’s creation history, as is well known, closely resembles that of <italic>Enuma Elish</italic> but with decisive differences.100 It, too, begins with the primordial waters (Genesis 1) and culminates with the construction of a divine residence (Exodus 35–40). But this narrative moves seamlessly from the time of creation to human history, which strictly speaking begins already on the sixth day of what we should now call “existence,” “history.” While the seventh day marks the completion of the physical universe, as God, not unlike Marduk, “rests” from the work of creation (Gen. 2:2–3, Exod. 31:17), it does not constitute that “last manifestation” of the divine crucial to Eliade’s conception of myth. Linear time marches on, and must, for the culmination of this history (Exod. 29:46), the construction of the Priestly tent, lies yet far in the future. The tent itself is built not by God (or other supernatural beings), but by human hands (Exod. 36:1), funded by human wealth (Exod. 35:20–29). This is so because this climactic event takes place not in mythic time but in the relatively recent historical past: after the patriarchs, the slavery in Egypt, the exodus, and the encounter at Sinai.101 Even when God finally takes up residence in this tent and establishes the divine presence on earth, time and the Israelites proceed, undeterred by this ersatz mythic milestone, toward their final destination: the Promised Land. This pivotal moment, then, no longer signifies cosmic stasis but the belated establishment of God’s “historical presence” within the physical universe. P’s primeval history does not take place <italic>in illo tempore</italic>, but in a “homogeneous” time it shares with all of human history. In other words, it is not a myth of cosmic necessity but the contingent history of an encounter between God and humankind.102 As for the ostensibly “mythic” ideas and motifs it inherits from ancient Near Eastern traditions, these have been transformed within the biblical episteme into mere homonyms.</p>
         <p>We finally note that <italic>Enuma Elish</italic> simultaneously creates sacred time and space through paradigmatic “manifestations.” As is well known, this myth came to be recited during the Akitu festival, namely, on the (spring) New Year.103 It reactualized creation—Marduk’s triumph over Tiamat and his establishment of the cosmic order—imbuing the cosmos with being. Sacred time, based on the lunar cycle and the vernal equinox, is thus structured as a repetition. The manifestation of sacred space in this myth is similarly constructed. By establishing Babylon and Marduk’s temple <italic>in principio</italic>, when the world was young, it represents this sacred center as part of the realm of mythic being: it is an eternal, necessary, and essential part of the cosmos. Which is to say, Babylon has always been sacred; it is inherently or naturally sacred. More generally, in fact, the cosmos as a whole is imbued with some quantum of being, for finally everything derives from the gods, ultimately from the very bodies of Tiamat and Apsu.104 The cosmos is not profane as such, for it has yet to be “disenchanted,” “desacralized.”</p>
         <p>P constructs sacred time and space according to different discursive rules. The Sabbath, for instance, though based upon the week of creation in Genesis 1, functions not as its reactualization but as its commemoration: “Between me and the children of Israel it is a sign for ever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed” (Exod. 31:17).105 As with the rainbow, the Sabbath is a “sign” (<italic>ʾôt</italic>), a signifier with conventional, as opposed to natural, meaning. While this “sign” connects past to present, it maintains their difference, establishing an external relation between ritual observance and the unique, unrepeatable events of sacred history. As a corollary, the very notion of the Sabbath itself is based on a purely abstract formalization divorced from anything in nature—every seventh day is decreed holy, that is, set apart.106 P similarly severs the (spring) New Year and thus the entire calendar from nature—the solar year—by turning it into the commemoration of a “historical” event, namely, the exodus (Exod. 12:1).107 Likewise, the spring festival (Passover–Unleavened Bread), whatever its origin, becomes the commemoration of the exodus—the other festivals (Feast of Weeks and Sukkoth) would eventually follow suit, albeit not in P.</p>
         <p>This logic enables us to account for the significance of the wilderness: why is the tent constructed outside of the “Holy Land”? It is not, as Benjamin Sommer has recently argued, that this sacred site is “locomotive,” a term by which he means to capture the nomadic nature of this structure, in opposition to Eliade’s notion of a fixed center—which J. Z. Smith would later designate “locative.”108 True, the tent wanders through the desert for forty years, but its location with respect to the camp—namely, the center—is fixed. It is no more locomotive than the nation as a whole. The reason for constructing the tent in the wilderness is that Canaan does not belong to this people from the beginning: it is “promised” to them at a relatively late moment in history and actually possessed later still. Likewise, its sacred sites were not always sacred but set apart as such after possession of the land.109 Thus, while the relationships between gods, humans, and land in <italic>Enuma Elish</italic> are autochthonous—that is, established in the mythical past—P, by constructing the tent and, indeed, the world in “this time,” conceives of sacred space, not as a necessary part of the cosmos but as the result of history, of a causal sequence of temporal, contingent, accidental events.110 The wilderness functions, in other words, as the locus of a “historicized myth,” a sacred history that takes place, not in the mythic past (<italic>in illo tempore</italic>), but in the so‐called wilderness period. If the cosmos in <italic>Enuma Elish</italic> derives from the gods, so that reality is fundamentally sacred, in P the physical universe is wholly “other” with respect to God, that is, profane, “disenchanted,” “desacralized.” The historical concept of the sacred, then, is an accident adhering to neutral substance. Nothing is inherently or essentially sacred. Rather, particular points of a fundamentally profane space‐time become sacred, are sanctified within history.</p>

               <p>Moran interprets the problem of human noise and overpopulation as the threat of chaos (“Atrahasis,” 58, and “Some Considerations,” 254), but the opposition of the static to the dynamic is closer to the mark. In <italic>Enuma Elish</italic>, e.g., precisely Tiamat and Apsu, the powers of the chaotic primordial waters, desire rest. The younger dynamic gods establish order precisely by disturbing the stasis of primordial chaos. Michalowski rejects the theme of overpopulation in <italic>Atrahasis</italic>, arguing that the flood “serves as an etiological charter which affirms the independent status of mankind” (“Presence at the Creation,” 389). But the fact that the noise is quelled and human fecundity is curbed argues against his interpretation. The gods may need humankind, but humans are confined to their divinely determined place in the cosmos, service of the gods.</p>

               <p>One might object that the Mesopotamian “king lists” supply a linear temporal bridge joining “that time” to “this.” However, while they may be of use for constructing a chronology of the ancient Near East (von Soden, <italic>Ancient Orient</italic>, 42–45), time as such does not enter these texts as a historical principle or as an object of knowledge. Rather, as von Soden observes, we should understand these lists within the context of Sumerian and Babylonian “science,” what he names a “science of order” (145). We can compare this one‐dimensional form of knowledge with Foucault’s account of “natural history” (such as that of Linnaeus) and the “classical episteme.” Although a putative form of “history,” this form of knowledge in fact classifies nature, mapping it onto a two‐dimensional surface, a “general grid of differences” (<italic>Order of Things</italic>, 145). “Time is never conceived as a principle of development for living beings in their internal organization” (150), and as a result, it is “impossible for <italic>natural history</italic> to conceive of <italic>the history of nature</italic>” (157).</p>

Whether this is a “conventional” unit of time, however, remains an open question.

         <p>We can finally understand the nature of the divine presence in P. Marduk’s presence is established in mythic time, because as an immanent deity he is native to the cosmos. Yahweh, however, transcends the physical universe and is thus alienated from it.111 This problematic, set up in Genesis 1—the externality of God‐as‐spirit to the physical universe—provides the framework for P’s concept of the divine “historical presence.” God’s presence on earth is unnatural, artificial, and so it cannot be projected into “that time,” as though it were a necessary and essential part of the cosmos. For a rigorous, formalist thinker such as P, divine transcendence is a problem to be overcome, divine presence a solution to be achieved. Specifically, God takes up residence on earth only within history, in a contingent encounter, an intrusion into time and space: the “glory” (<italic>kābôd</italic>). It is therefore misleading to claim, as does Moshe Weinfeld, that P’s concept is “more corporeal” than the Deuteronomist’s “more abstractly” conceived notion of <italic>šēm</italic> (“name”).112 As with E, D provides an alternate surface expression of the same metaphysical concept as P. For D, God belongs in heaven, not on earth, not even in the temple, where he merely places his “name” (Deut. 12:11, 21, etc.). But in exchange, D can indulge in unabashed anthropomorphism: God “walks around” the camp, which must remain clean lest God “see” something indecent and “turn away” (23:15). P’s “glory” is, in contrast, present and concrete but utterly disembodied.</p>
         <p>P establishes and maintains God’s presence through a cultic‐technological solution to the problem of dualism, namely, the tent and accompanying priestly rituals, which function as a type of architectural “incarnation.”113 The glory, however, remains an altogether artificial and unnatural presence on earth. An intrusion of transcendence into the empirical, it is dangerous and volatile, a toxic and hazardous substance, as it were, requiring proper containment—as the Israelites painfully learn from the deaths of Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10. But their untimely, unnatural deaths, so soon after the tent’s construction, do not indicate priestly skepticism toward the very possibility of their theology of presence.114 Rather, their deaths demonstrate the deadly seriousness with which the priests viewed their cultic duties. For only the most meticulous observance of priestly ritual will successfully maintain this—to evoke Rudolf Otto’s terms—“mysterious” and “tremendous” presence on earth. In its absence, as Ezekiel would later observe (Ezekiel 10), the Priestly God must return to his native, immaterial realm.</p>

               <p>Erich Auerbach thus assigns God to some “unknown height or depth” (<italic>Mimesis</italic> [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1953], 8). Sommer rightly rejects the allegorical‐historicist reading of God’s “locomotive” presence as a reference to the Babylonian Exile and destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 586 BCE (“Conflicting Constructions of Divine Presence,” 57–58): contra Cross, “Priestly Tabernacle,” 228; and Mettinger, <italic>Dethronement</italic>, 96, 113. But he still misleadingly interprets the divine presence in P as “God’s own exile in the world” (“Conflicting Constructions of Divine Presence,” 61)—a purely spatial image, incommensurate with God’s metaphysical otherness. See also Benjamin D. Sommer, “Expulsion as Initiation: Displacement, Divine Presence, and Divine Exile in the Torah,” in <italic>Beginning/Again: Toward a Hermeneutics of Jewish Texts</italic>, ed. Aryeh Cohen and Shaul Magid (New York: Seven Bridges Press, 2002), 23–48; and J. Z. Smith, <italic>Map Is Not Territory</italic>, 104–28, esp. 119–28.</p>

               <p>Sommer draws a suggestive connection between God’s “glory” (Septuagint, <italic>doxa</italic>) dwelling in P’s “tent” (Septuagint, <italic>skēnē</italic>) and John 1:14: Jesus “dwelt” (<italic>eskēnōsen</italic>) on earth, revealing the Father’s “glory” (<italic>doxan</italic>) (“Conflicting Constructions of Divine Presence,” 57). But he reads this merely as a type of divine exile, whereas I would insist upon the pronounced dualism in John’s formulation: word (<italic>logos</italic>) become flesh (<italic>sarx</italic>). In this light, we can now return to Lacan’s and Kojève’s views on the origin of modern science. According to “biblical or judaic ideology,” as we witness in the Priestly tent (and the Law in general), the letter (the eternal) impinges upon the empirical—structurally analogous (though not identical) to the incarnation. Both thinkers, then, were apparently attempting to account for what Koyré recognized in modern science: “The radical novelty of the fact that mathematics could be connected with empiricity rather than eternity” (Milner, “Lacan and the Ideal of Science,” 35). Now if dualism also emerges among the ancient Greeks, their philosophical tradition apparently does not provide the means to sublate it. The empirical thus remains untouched by eternity, so that knowledge of the empirical remains trapped within the empirical itself. This perhaps is what Lacan meant by pronouncing “primitive science” a “sexual technique.”</p>
