<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mystery Science Theater 3000, Med?a Consciousness, and the Postmodern Allegory of the Captive Audience JOHN KING in 1985, one year after the projected time of George Orwell's dystopian vision of totalitarian ism, communications theorist Neil Postman surveyed the effect of television on American culture and concluded, in his not-so-subtly titled study of popular media, that we were Amusing Ourselves to Death.1 Postman argued that in the twentieth century, American dis course had experienced a "great media-meta phor shift" (16) in which the epistemological metaphor of the book (as an image of how best to understand things) has yielded to the epis temological metaphor of television. Because television does not (and essentially, due to its discontinuous, visual form, cannot) emphasize depth of knowledge or sustained reasoning, Postman demonstrated that this superficial epistemology trivializes newsgathering, reli gion, statesmanship, and education across the entirety of American culture. By its ubiquity and influence, television "has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience" (87). Such knowledge as television fosters?and more importantly, the model of knowing that television makes one accustomed to?is "dangerous and absurdist" (27), even if that model has become the status quo of American culture. When, in his conclusion, the time comes to recommend solutions to the problems outlined in Amusing Ourselves to Death, Postman is predictably pessimistic. One solution, which he regards as absurd, is that television could somehow instruct its viewers on how to watch television critically and reject the passivity fostered by its incessant flow of easy, context free images. In short, he posits the immensely remote and ultimately futile possibility that a television program could actually promote "media consciousness" (161) enough to get people to (in former FCC Commissioner Nicho las Johnson's words) "begin talking back at their television sets" (160). This would seem to require television programmers and market ers to act against their professional interests, by breaking the three commandments of ef fortless (almost noncognitive) entertainment that Postman sanctimoniously outlines: "thou shalt have no prerequisites" (147), "thou shalt induce no perplexity" (147), and "thou shalt avoid exposition like the ten plagues visited upon Egypt" (148). By the mid-1980s, however, cable televi sion had, according to television historian Erik Barnouw, "suddenly changed the shape of American television" (496). Viewers once accustomed to perhaps ten channels now experienced a superabundance of channels, a forty-channel universe that included MTV, Nickelodeon, ESPN, and eventually, Comedy Central (n?e the Comedy Channel) and that undermined the monopoly the three major broadcast networks had exercised through most of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In those relatively early days of basic cable television, original programming for the fledgling chan John king earned a PhD in English from Purdue University in 2003. His scholarly work has ap peared in the Journal of Modern Literature, Twen tieth Century Literature, and English Language Notes. JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 37 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="2">neis was far less slick and mainstream than it is now. Currently, most basic cable channels flex corporate-strength muscle and are in fact over whelmingly financially interdependent with the now five major networks, which, for their part, have copied the commercially viable elements pioneered by the cable channels, so that now basic cable and network television are often practically indistinguishable. In 1982, though, cable stations, needing to fill massive blocks of programming and struggling with heavy start-up and infrastructure debts, often relied on reruns of syndicated network programs and movies (Barnouw 513; Mullen 130); in one of her chapter titles in The Rise of Cable Program ming in the United States, Megan Mullen calls cable "Broadcast Television's Resource-Starved Imitator." So long as original programming was cheap, cable networks could offer alternatives to network television, alternatives that even dared to break the commandments of enter tainment. For several years, Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) was just such an iconoclastic alternative?one predicated to a surprisingly effective degree on Postman's hopeless hope of media consciousness. After an amateurish season on UHF channel KTMA in Minnesota, from 1988-1989, MST3K emerged nationally on the content-hungry Comedy Channel in 1989, where it aired through 1996. It then limped, quite altered, over to the Sci-Fi Channel in 1997, and reached its terminus in 1999. Cable Television and Postmodernism When the show debuted on Comedy Central, it almost immediately became a cult hit, in part because it was a television refuge for intelligent members of the comic book and sci-fi crowd, and in part because it could be taken for an allegory of existence in a corporate-controlled media-state. The premise: in the not-too-dis tant future, mad scientists in the employ of Gizmonic Institute?operating from the shad owy, nuclear-waste-ridden depths of their Deep 13 headquarters?launch a good-natured jani tor into outer space and force him to live on a satellite and watch the inept products of popu lar culture, usually low-grade science fiction from the crusty past. While the premise might seem to be what Hollywood would call "high concept"?i.e., simple and very catchy?in practice the show represented a uniquely ab stract experience. The format was that, joel (the janitor) and his robots would first introduce themselves, and then they and the mad scien tists would present new concepts in what was called an "invention exchange." Then joel and his robots would retreat in a conditioned panic to a movie theater, where, as silhouettes at the bottom of the screen, they watched an entire film, with three intermissions for sketches and discussions. This essay focuses on the seasons Joel Hodg son portrayed the main character (episodes 1 24 on KTMA and episodes 101-512 on Comedy Central). This is in the interests of space; a full study of the program would be large indeed. In part, however, this focus is also symbolic, for Joel Hodgson created /WSTj/C, and after six full years he could no longer continue to create it with pleasure.2 Seven episodes after he left, the invention-exchange segment disappeared from the program (last appearance: "The Atomic Brain"); gradually other major actors left the program as well.3 These departures could be the result of the show's dwindling popularity in its later years, but they also seem to indicate that the participants were burning out from the strain of trying to counteract television's almost monolithic dominance over media conscious ness. The timing for such a metashow was propi tious, for in the postmodern condition, media exhaustion seemed not just a real possibil ity, but the equivalent of reality itself. In "The Literature of Exhaustion" (1967), John Barth explored the aesthetic consequences of the then-growing belief that writing was no longer capable of producing any original voice, style, or form?in short, that writers could not out-in novate modernism, but merely intensify and ironize accomplishments of the past; all that remained for the artist was to focus metaphysi cally on the "exhaustion of certain possibility" 38 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="3">(29) by endlessly recombining what already exists.4 With much less ambivalence, Frederic Jameson argued something similar in Post modernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capi talism, looking far, far beyond literature. For Jameson, the overwhelming speed and awful scope of postmodern culture not only becomes a quality in itself, but it actually eradicates all notions of historical quality: the frenzy whereby virtually anything in the present is appealed to for testimony as to the letter's uniqueness and radical difference from earlier moments of human time does indeed strike one sometimes as harboring a pathology distinctively autoreferential, as though our utter forgetfulness of the past ex hausted itself in the vacant but mesmerized contemplation of a schizophrenic present that is incomparable by definition, (xii) In this amnesiac world, the idea of a separation between "high" and "low" art begins to close, as everything and nothing becomes relevant in its transformation into consumption, an impulse Jameson often claims is derived from multinational corporations maneuvering to consistently increase their monolithic growth: The postmodernisms have, in fact, been fas cinated precisely by this whole "degraded" landscape of schlock and kitsch, of TV series and Reader's Digest culture, of advertising and motels, of the late show and the grade-B Hollywood film, of so-called paraliterature, with its airport paperback categories of the gothic and the romance, the popular biog raphy, the murder mystery, and the science fiction or fantasy novel: materials they no longer simply "quote," as a Joyce or a Mahler might have done, but incorporate into their very substance. (2-3) Jameson might here be claiming too much agency on behalf of artists, as most artists (or at least second-generation postmodern authors and younger) don't choose to "incorporate" mass culture into their consciousnesses?mass culture has been incorporated as a matter of course, generally building up a huge store of mass-culture references before it occurs to them that there is any alternative to watching toxic quantities of television. David Foster Wallace recounts being a stu dent in a fiction workshop in which "transgen erational discourse broke down" (167) between the "earnest gray eminence" (167) of a profes sor and his Generation-X students over the use of pop culture references in fiction. The profes sor indignantly protested that nothing of the "frivolous Now" (167) should appear in fiction, and the younger writers responded that they could not write meaningfully about their world without addressing the inundation of popular culture?very little of contemporary life is not somehow penetrated by the "f. N.," as Wallace puts it. The truth is that unless you are reared on the oldest of old money, in the archest of intellectual circles, or among the Amish, your cultural life as an American will almost certainly not just contain but be overfilled with popular culture. To anyone who somehow awakens with a nostalgic longing for a psyche uncontami nated by television?to embrace something other than a frivolous Now?one might say, as Tom Stoppard's Guildenstem says, in another context, "There must have been a moment, at the beginning, where we could have said?no. But somehow we missed it" (125). But as media critic Mark Crispin Miller has pointed out, by at least the mid-1970s, one could not exist in the public sphere without being conscious of "the interminable text of television, usually somewhere in view, and never out of earshot" (Boxed In ).5 Miller tells us, "Certainly you could choose not to own a television set, but such a refusal would con demn you to a life of touristic ignorance, for TV had now become the native language" (10). (This is also why David Foster Wallace implicitly argues that an understanding of television and its effects amounts to a moral imperative for American writers.) To be Americans, we must immerse ourselves in this "native element,"6 even though doing so seems to lead, as Miller (along lines similar to Postman's) argues in The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder, to an epidemic incapacity for even JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 39 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="4">moderately competent reasoning. At the very least, American television legitimizes stupidity, and its cumulative effects may be as dire as Miller and Postman have argued. Dr. Forrester, the chief mad scientist of MST3K, once likened producing and broadcasting subrate, made-for TV movies to giving cancer to lab rats, the rats being analogous to human viewers ("City on Fire"). Science fiction writer and popular-culture theorist David J. Skal argues that typically in popular culture "the mad scientist has served as a lightning rod for the otherwise unbearable anxieties about the meaning of scientific think ing and the uses and consequences of modern technology" (18). In this admirable study, Skal focuses on television as one of those modern technologies we might feel anxious about: "The seeming explosion of multiple personal ity disorder, and widespread acceptance of its reality, may have less to do with a real clinical state than with the accelerated fragmentation of consciousness in recent decades. Every American couch potato, after all, has instant access to a multiplicity of viewpoint shifts at the click of a button, the 500 Cable Options of Eve" (201-202). Dr. Forrester is a mad scientist who, with his shock of Einstein hair and neon colored lab-coat, represents precisely this fascination with technological innovation, a fascination that manifests itself either as disen gagement from the social consequences of the innovation, or as outright sadistic glee at those consequences. His fascination seems only slightly more extreme than that of the corporate owners and sponsors of television. If life has increasingly been redefined as spectatorship, then experience is a horrorfilm in which the viewers are the victims. By the late 1980s, television's ubiquity had largely been enabled by its perfection of irony its shameless ability to make fun not only of it self but of almost any value, and thus to deflect all criticism of itself as a witless redundancy, even as its outrageousness continues to attract viewers. As Miller warns, "TV seems to flatter the inert skepticism of its own audience, assur ing them that they can do no better than to stay right where they are, rolling their eyes in feeble disbelief. And yet such apparent flattery of our viewpoint is in fact a recurrent warning not to rise above this slack, derisive gaping" (326). This is what David Foster Wallace is referring to when he writes, "Surely we all have friends we just hate to hear talk about TV because they so clearly loathe it?they sneer relentlessly at the hackneyed plots, the unlikely dialogue, the Cheez-Whiz resolutions, the bland condescen sion of the news anchors, the shrill wheedling of commercials?and yet are just as clearly ob sessed with it, somehow need to hate their six hours a day, day in and out" (156). The late 1980s and early 1990s seemed to take such irony to a new, almost existential level. Consider Seinfeld (1989-98), a clever but relatively plotless show that would by its fourth season gleefully declare itself to be a show about "nothing" ("The Pitch"), a maneu ver that somehow seemed to imply that all of television was about nothing. Former morning talk-show host Kathie Lee Gifford half-jealously said about Seinfeld, "Hey, we were nothing before they were nothing, and you can quote me on that. We own nothingness. Let's give credit where it's due" (Tracy 185-86). And this self-reflexivity obviated what had been the severest criticism of Jerry Seinfeld's observa tional humor, which in some ways structured his brilliant sit-com?"insignificance" (Tracy 52). How do you critique a show that accepts its own irrelevance to a meaningful life, and how do you rhetorically defend your efforts to do so? Or consider Beavis and Butthead (1993-97), a cautionary narrative that taught viewers the nihilism that would seem to be the inevitable result of a life entirely centered on television? the madness of an exaggerated, arrested adolescence that is now, according to Douglas Rushkoff, one of the most sought-after demo graphics in television viewership, "corporate America's $150 billion dream" (Merchants). The Postmodern Allegory Like Beavis and Butthead, MST3K featured heavy doses of us watching people watch media. Each MST3K episode is mostly devoted 40 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="5">to the host's silhouette watching and comment ing on movies. Here was someone talking back at his theater screen, if not his television. The janitor was trapped and manipulated, just as many Americans feel trapped and manipu lated by corporations and media conglomer ates. Interestingly, the name of the janitor is Joel Robinson, whose name (follow the semi otic chain here) recalls the stranded Robinson family from the vintage sci-fi television series Lost in Space (1965-68), which in turn recalls the stranded family from Swiss Family Robinson (novel, 1812; film, i960), which in turn, in an inversion of first and last names, ever so faintly recalls (to the especially literate) the stranded protagonist of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719).7 Ultimately, the idea of an originary text be comes irrelevant. This allusion to an allusion to an allusion seems to indicate the show's awareness of the exhausting exhaustion of postmodern popular culture.8 Joel, as the theme song tells us, is "not too different from you and me." Just as the Robin son families are supposed to be archetypal, so, on some sort of level, is Joel, although he isn't initially stranded with his family, and his solitude could have resembled that of Dave Bowman at the close of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)?with a theater of execrable pop culture instead of a monolith. Joel's solution simulta neously rescues him from loneliness and traps him in the purgatorial control of the scientists. The theme song informs us, "Keep in mind, Joel can't control when the movies begin or end / Because he used those special parts to make his robot friends." Joel, we soon learn, is an amateur inventor particularly good at creating, programming, and maintaining highly intelli gent, if perversely willful, robots. So perhaps he is not entirely just like you or me (or maybe just me).9 But Joel is likeable, his proletariat status as janitor marks him as some sort of Everyman, and we are meant to identify with him,10 just as we are meant to identify with the extraordinary Robinson families. And with his 'bots (Crow T. Robot, Tom Servo, Gypsy [Rose], Ca m bot, and Magic Voice) to accompany him, Joel does live something resembling a family life, with himself as the father figure and Crow and Servo often behaving like spoiled Wunderkind. On this level, MST3K is an allegory for the dena tured postmodern American family held captive by television. joel and his robots, then, are like living foot notes on the bottom of the television screen, commenting on whatever film or television show we are watching them watch. This meta theater of television?metatelevision?indeed fosters "media consciousness," makes us aware of how the very form of popular films and television tends to trivialize everything it touches. And in doing so, MST3K broke two of Postman's three commandments of enter tainment: "thou shalt have no prerequisites" and "thou shalt induce no perplexity" (147). Initially, this low-budget show seemed similar to other puppet-related shows of the past (an ever-so-slightly more subversive Kukla, Fran, and Ollie, perhaps), and despite its at times erudite (and adult-oriented) tone, it garnered a large following among children, many of whom wrote letters to the show, often accompanied by crayon renderings of the cast. Despite this semblance of simplicity and almost indiscrimi nate openness, however, the show could be said to have prerequisites, as it relied (probably more heavily than any other show in televi sion history) on references for the humor of its commentary?and the range of commentary was staggering. A viewer needs an encyclope dic knowledge of world history, current events, science, sociology, literature, art, art criticism, film, and television, to name a few, in order to grasp most of the content of every program. I doubt any single viewer can understand most of a program in a single viewing. While each episode includes gobs of slapstick and low brow humor, these crude qualities appear in a highly referential context that, like Joyce in Ulysses and Eliot in The Waste Land, includes the full spectrum of our cultural present and past. And in time, these references included the content of MST3K itself, as a memorably bad scene in a particular film often became archetypal for that kind of scene in other bad JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2OO7 41 ?2 7 ?Y THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="6">films?bad films often gravitating toward similar inanities. One prominent example ap peared in the "Rocketmen from the Moon" serials, in which thugs enter a laboratory, guns at the ready, while a scientist is stooped over. When the thugs pause, joel and the robots say, as ifin a tone of admiration, "I'd hate to shoot a butt like that" ("Robot Monster"). Amazingly, this catch phrase turned out to be appropriate for later episodes as well (such as "Rocket Attack U.S.A." and "The Hellcats"). Or another example, the banality of this com ment by a woman stranded in Africa during World War II: "What I wouldn't give for a ham burger and some nice french-fried potatoes" ("The Jungle Goddess"). Joel and the robots repeated this line whenever any feckless character felt any privation whatsoever (as in "Lost Continent" and "Gamera vs. Baruon"). And whenever a film featured an even slightly desolated landscape ("Fugitive Alien," "City Limits") Tom Servo would mimic the preten tious, halting voice-over that offered exposi tion about the suddenness of the "Robot Holo caust."11 The most famous catchphrase of the show?"Hikeeba!"?used whenever any hero or villain made any sort of action maneuver, referred back to a moment in "Women of the Prehistoric Planet," when a spaceship engi neer (Wendell Corey, playing the excruciatingly unfunny comic relief) screams this phrase to punctuate an inept kung fu move that leads to a forward flip that leaves him flat on his back. The force of these reflexive in-jokes is in recalling the history of watching these programs?a joy in mnemonic play not dissimilar to the joys Harold Bloom finds in contemplating the literary canon (39), only with the idea of cultural excellence taken out?and killed. As for ywSr3/Cs complexity, most main stream television viewers bypassed this show because of the slow-paced oddness implicit in watching other people watch entire movies. (By comparison, Beavis and Butthead featured much briefer metatelevisual segments than did MST3K, music videos are more frenetic than the movies of yore, and Beavis and Butthead's adolescent commentary was generally not complicated.)12 For many mainstream viewers, /WS7"3/Cwas incomprehensibly boring. Because the show eschewed traditional narrative, most viewers could not cope with the extreme brico lage aesthetics the show depended on. Unlike most dramas and sitcoms, viewers could not half-consciously tune in to this program at almost any point and still grasp its story arc. And the elementary cinematography of MST3K required patience: when the movie experiment was not underway the show employed only one camera, thus relatively under-stimulating the eyes of American audiences, with no cuts what soever except for the introductory and conclud ing segments, when the camera shifts between Deep 13 and the satellite. Postmodern Exhaustion on the Satellite of Love Joel and his roboticai cohorts have dubbed their prison in the sky "the Satellite of Love." On one level, this is an empowering moniker that cheers the industrial gloom of a generic satellite in outer space, and signifies something human in a way that the terms "Deep 13" and "Gizmonic Institute" clearly do not. At the same time, the "Satellite of Love" is a sly allusion to the dreamy 1972 Lou Reed song of the same name. Reed's lyrics are the hazy musings of a lovesick man whose vision of outer space?a metaphor for the expansive, imaginative possibilities of love?is mediated entirely through the numbingly rep etitious, virtual space of television, while the realities of his terrestrial, three-dimensional love are less promising, fraught with the likelihood of sexual and romantic betrayal: Satellite's gone up to the skies Things like that drive me out of my mind I watched it for a little while I like to watch things on TV Satellite of love satellite of love Satellite of love satellite of 42 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="7">Satellite's gone way up to Mars Soon it will be filled with parking cars I watch it fora little while I love to watch things on TV Satellite of love satellite of love Satellite of love satellite of I've been told that you've been bold with Harry, Mark and John Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to Thursday with Harry, Mark and John Satellite's gone up to the skies Things like that drive me out of my mind I watched it for a little while I love to watch things on TV Satellite of love [repeat ad nauseam] By calling his orbital domicile the "Satellite of Love," Joel Robinson suggests that he and his robots might be inspirational to frustrated earth-dwellers who "love to watch things on TV," yet ironically he himself is someone who watches things on TV. Most of Mystery Science Theater3000 entails the mise en abyme of watching someone on television watching a movie. There is theoretically no end to the me diation of the media?occasionally an MST3K movie will even feature someone watching a television monitor, so that at that moment we are watching someone on television watch a movie of someone watching television. Media tion of mediation of mediation: this suggests something of a metaphysical plenitude, but in practical terms it stretches authentic meaning across more and more space, ultimately into obscurity. (In Reed's song, the phrase "satellite of love" is pleonastically replicated until the words become meaningless.) If such metatele visual moments threaten us with an infinite regress, however, this is only a heightened ver sion of what normally happens to significance on television: for if one culturally valuable show can be exploited in the media cycle, then any show, no matter how original or superior, can be; its own exhaustion and obsolescence are waiting to be realized,13 its own coolness wait ing to be killed by overexposure, or mocked by the ironic viewers of the future. Even the new est of frontiers must someday "be filled / with parking cars." Media Consciousness Partly what made television viewing so deplet ing, what gave it the power to fatally overex pose anything unique or authentic or new, was the (eventual) perfection of television advertising. As Mark Crispin Miller notices in "Deride and Conquer," the nature of television advertising and programming were in the 1980s nearing a "mutual approximation" that "works to the distinct advantage of advertisers, whose messages are today no longer overshadowed, contradicted, or otherwise threatened by pro gramming that is too noticeably different from the ads" (190). Mystery Science Theater3000 was a rare example of a program in the 1980s and 1990s that deliberately tried to distinguish itself from commercials as it tried to resist (or parodically embrace) its own exploitation and the exploitation of its viewers. For example, often in season one, and occasionally later, either Joel or the robots would offer a snide transition that drew attention to the fact that the entertainment was switching over to com mercials. When the robots, behaving like bright, mischievous children, ask about con fusing figures of speech, Tom Servo asks Joel, "How do you explain head cheese?" To which Joel responds, "Well, uh, I don't explain head cheese, but, uh, here are some people who do," just before going to commercials ("The Crawling Eye"). I note sixteen such instances of broadcast differentiation during the first five seasons on cable television.14 These segues accomplish the contextualized nesting of the advertising in the content of the show, so that the commercials in a sense become part of what is critiqued, become what Megan Mullen JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 200J 43 ?2 7 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="8">calls "an integral part of the program texts" (170), even as they attempt to exploit the show and its viewers. More explicit than these segues, however, are Joel and the robots' parody sketches of com mercials. For example, in "Project Moonbase," they pretend to hawk some blubbery, flubbery goo called Spacom (after the graceless name of a space station in Project Moonbase)?"the miracle home product you thought you'd never need!"?in a mockery of those breathless, exclu sive TV offers for merchandise that were so com mon before the advent of the infomercial. Like the announcer of the Ginsu-knife commercials of old, Crow giddily proclaims, "It cuts through this tomato like it was a tin can!" The rhetorical ploys used by infomercials themselves were mocked in a sketch to sell Phantom Creeps, a pointless pyrotechnical device using disks and spiders, an idea derived from the intensely bor ing Phantom Creeps serial starring Bela Legosi ("Jungle Goddess"). Another breathless com mercial (using frenetic cuts of close-up stills rather than action photography) was concocted fora quite deranged five-thousand-piece fight ing-men-and-monsters set, a commercial nar rated by Servo, who is clearly over-stimulated by all of this excess and finally devolves into the homicidal villain of David Lynch's Blue Velvet, Frank Booth ("Gamera vs. Barugon").1* Other parodies included an alarming array of edibles (sort of) from an alternative company called Klack ("First Spaceship on Venus"); Mighty Jack Dog Food ("Mighty Jack"); the Captain Joe ac tion figure ("Star Force: Fugitive Alien II"); Basil Rathbone dog biscuits ("The Magic Sword"); a Hercules nonaction figure ("Hercules and the Captive Women"); and John Banner-grams ("The Crash of the Moons"). In one of the most memorable commercial parodies, Crow and Tom Servo portray Orville Redenbacher and his grandson ("Godzilla vs. Megalon"), stars of the sentimental popcorn commercials of the early 1990s. In the stunningly accurate words of The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, written by the cast and writers of the show, "Tom and Crow enact a very strange scene in which Orville Redenbacher and his grandson do something in the tone of Long Day's Journey into Nighf (29). Even more satirical than the Orville Reden bacher bit were two sketches directly address ing the dark consequences of the marketplace. While the mad scientists often featured evil versions of commercial phenomena, such as Tragic Moments figurines ("Being from Another Planet"), Unhappy Meals ("The Day the Earth Froze"), or nasty baseball-promotion nights ("The Girl in Lover's Lane"), they took their evil to a new level when they manufactured Johnny Longtorso, a bland-looking component doll "who is himself sold separately," so that each doll costs over three hundred dollars. In the other sketch, which resembles a kitschy public service announcement, Crow dresses up as Willy the Waffle (don't ask) to defend advertis ing when Tom Servo, sitting before a televi sion, declares, "Boy, do I have a headache. I have a head full of bad ideas. You know, I am beginning to think the world would be a better place with no advertising" ("The Bride of the Monster"). While initially Crow succeeds at de fending advertising, eventually Willy the Waffle must concede that without it, pretentious Gap ads featuring British poets would disappear, our brains would not be cluttered with the knowledge of where John Madden shops for hardware, the price of sneakers would be only a fraction of what it is today, and the rain forest would probably not be threatened (presumably by the need for paper for catalogs). After this list of concessions, he groans and, just before the show goes to a commercial, inauspiciously says, "Advertising?enjoy some now." Libido, Loneliness, Disappearance of Authentic Self While Mystery Science Theater 3000 perhaps succeeds at undermining its own exploitation by the very medium and marketplace that gave birth to it, these small victories do not make life on the Satellite of Love idyllic. Joel, forced to watch inept pop culture in the isolation of outer space, can only long for authentic human experience. Much is made of how the letters 44 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OFTHE UNIVERSITY OFILLINOIS</page><page sequence="9">from viewers, read aloud at the end of every episode, help to cheer him up (such as during "Star Force: Fugitive Alien II"), and he can be inspirited for a short while by the semiorganic flora of vacuum-flowers ("The Crawling Hand"). Moreover, although Tom Servo and Crow are often willful, they, too, provide him an essential form of companionship. Nevertheless, Joel's life is not altogether fulfilling, as we see in "Hercules against the Moon Men," when, gaz ing at the ample-bosomed Princess of Samara as she discusses her wedding hopes with a girlfriend, Joel confides to the robots, "Guys, I am so homesick right now."16 Perhaps what is surprising is how seldom Joel, the solitary bachelor on his Satellite of Love, expresses anything like an aching libido. Perhaps part of what makes him differ ent from other males his age is that he only watches the equivalent for ninety minutes of television a week, two and one-half hours less than the national daily average for men.17 Psychologically, across American culture, what television promises is the allure of fitting in, of belonging; ironically, what it asks them to do is to stay passively isolated at home. This in turn generates more anxiety about fitting in, anxiety that can be conveniently, temporarily assuaged by more ultimately unsatisfying television, thus perhaps hollowing out the very notion of a self, if Mark Crispin Miller is correct in "Deride and Conquer" (223). David Foster Wallace suggests that this tendency at least borders on the cycle of addictive behavior: If it's true that many Americans are lonely, and if it's true that many lonely people are prodigious TV-watchers, and if it's true that lonely people find in television's 2D images relief from the pain of their reluctance to be around real humans, then it's also obvious that the more time spent watching TV, the less time spent in the real human world, and the less time spent in the real human world, the harder it becomes not to feel alienated from real humans, solipsistic, lonely. (163) Ironically, more of an Everyman than Joel Robinson is the character named TV's Frank, who?despite his celebrity's having worked its way into his very name?is, from a corporate perspective, the perfect television viewer, one for whom television is necessary. When Dr. Forrester gloats over the dreck that Joel must watch ("Monster a Go-Go") while he and Frank are free to do as they please, Frank earnestly notes that a Matlock marathon is coming on. Or when Dr. Forrester wants to twit Crow about having to watch movies instead of fine foreign films and invites Frank to see a Kurosawa fes tival, Frank is too wowed by Joel's immensely silly demonstration of the theremin?the whiny, warbly electronic instrument that uses low power, high-frequency electromagnetic fields to produce that clich?d sci-fi sound?to be inter ested in anything else. In fact, Frank's commit ment to callow entertainment over self-growth or authentic interpersonal relationships is made absolutely clear by the invention of the U View, a television that depicts what one would have been doing if one weren't watching tele vision ("Swamp Diamonds"). On the U-View, Frank is enjoying the company of Michelle Pfei ffer,18 who seductively invites him inside for the night, but the U-View version of himself refuses in order to scurry home to the famously vapid Bay watch?a particularly postmodern moment in which the only imaginable alternative to tele vision is ... television. There is no ontological escape from artificiality and mediation.19 Scylla of Camp, Charybdis of Cheese Lest we sink into pseudo-Platonic or straightfor wardly Baudrillardian condemnation of simula tions in themselves, we must come to terms with the nature of the mediations featured on MST3K. According to The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, among the films watched were "several truly awful, a few horrifying, and a small handful that can serve as the maw of Hell itself" (vii). For example, there was The Castle of Fu Manchu, a racist film with washed-out color, continu ally out of focus and with a plot that is equally indistinct. Or there was the legendary Manos: The Hands of Fate, a poorly dubbed film with JOURNAL OF FILM AND V?DEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 45 ?2007 BY THE BOARO OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="10">washed-out color, continually out of focus and with a plot that, at its best, is equally indistinct but that proves, when it can be made out, sexu ally revolting. This film features an establishing shot of a family driving on vacation that lasted several minutes, a deranged amount of pad ding that made Crow inquire if they were some how watching a snuff film. Aesthetically, then, these films are almost empirically bad in their inception, by any standards one could choose: writing, acting, editing, directing, lighting. Even the work of key grips must be suspect. The ways the MST3K audience receives these atrocious movies are variously complex, however. Often, they are watched on the level of camp, demonstrating, as Susan Sontag put it in her famous essay on the subject, "the sensibility of failed serious ness, of the theatricalization of experience" (286). The exaggerated styles of antique sci ence fiction can be delightful in their oddity; the ham-fisted acting of yesteryear's leading men is ironically compelling in its self-assur ance in overstated gender-roles; the absolute credence of vintage educational films is star tling in its emotional and political naivety. Camp involves an ironic distance on the part of the viewer, a detachment from which he or she can marvel at "a contrast between silly or ex travagant content and rich form'" (278). As the new privileged aestheticism of the 1960s, camp was what Sontag, after Genet, calls "a good taste of bad taste" (291). More often than often, though, the films of Mystery Science Theater 3000 lack the style necessary to be campy?films that have impoverished forms and very often silly and extravagant content as well. Camp, according to Sontag, generally refers to works that implicitly aspire to serious art, and it is difficult to gauge how seriously filmmakers were committed to making, say, Monster a Go-Go. Simultaneously, then, these films are consumed on the similarly ironic level of cheese. Cheese theorist Annalee Newitz sees cheese as the 1990s successor to camp, the newest incarnation of parodie con sumption of art. Cheesy movies are not only ex travagant in content, but are ineptly envisioned or produced as well. The moralizing monologue that serves as the pretentious coda to Roger Corman's It Conquered the World, in which Dr. Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) laments that Dr. Tom Anderson (Lee Van Cleef) "learned almost too late that Man is a feeling creature, and because of it, the greatest in the universe,"20 is pure camp, except that Tom Anderson had seconds before he perished in an internecine melee with a six-foot anthropomorphic pickle, which is pure Velveeta. These two fluid sensibilities sometimes overlap into cheesy camp. More often than camp, though, the sensibil ity of cheese is essential to MST3K, since its subject is mostly cheap science fiction and horror movies. On a conceptual level, in its vi sion and production values, the program even displayed the underground spirit of cheese spectatorship. Instead of compelling, state-of the-art special effects or a gleaming, polished style, the program generally aspired to low tech (if sometimes clever) visual effects and a haphazard style. As Frank Coniff, a writer and actor for MST3K, once revealed, the show "was supposed to look cheap, so once our budget went up, we still kept the show looking very low-budget, and all of the extra money went into food" (Coniff 29). For example, the stars of outer space are clearly lights on a black back ground, and the walls of the Satellite of Love are a mosaic of found items, such as the Mil lennium Falcon toy made by Kenner. The robots are similarly made of the plastic detritus of yes terday's everyday life. Crow's beak-like mouth, for example, is made of an Empire Toys bowling pin cut in half and painted gold, the back of his head is the gilded grillwork of a hockey helmet, and his torso is constructed of descending gold Tupperware floraliers. Tom's head is a red Car ousel Snack Dispenser, and his torso a Money Lover's Barrel bank painted red with the block of model car engine attached to it. In "Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy," in which the Satellite of Love is invaded by demon dogs, the critters in question are slightly modified versions of the skeletal, quadruped action-figure caddy in the Masters of the Universe toy line, an item my brother used to play with growing up. The 46 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="11">show's design calls to mind a Radio Shack, a Home Depot, and a garage sale ingeniously used, rather than George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic. Furthermore, the acting (espe cially sleepy-voiced Joel Hodgson) was substan dard, with flubs and imperfectly delivered lines regularly cluttering the performances?and not retaken or cut out, as surely they would have been on most mainstream programs. While this cheesy aesthetic helps to dif ferentiate MST3K from shows that conspicu ously tried to look hip, it also suggests that the cheesy past is contiguous with the cheesy present. If, as Newitz argues, "cheesy humor is one way U.S. audiences try to laugh off the social and economic differences that continue to hurt and divide us" (79), then the humor of Mystery Science Theater 3000, generally speak ing,21 serves a higher satirical purpose, as it tends to regard camp and cheese as timeless, or at least as historically related to the present. In "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians," for example, Santa Claus smugly tells a television reporter that he has never let children down yet, and Joel adds, "Except for the poor ones." In that same astoundingly campy episode, Joel notes that Mrs. Claus is a dead ringer for the atavistic Barbara Bush, and Tom suggests that the elves are threatening to unionize. In "Jungle Goddess," the racial condescension of the white explorers and the White Goddess stirs Joel's ire; when the White Goddess quizzes the suspiciously light-skinned Zambezi native Wanama on the orthography of beautiful, Joel spells out "s-l-a-v-e-r-y." In spite of the arch revelations of Jessica A. Royer's error-prone polemic on MST3K,22 this program, while mired in the degraded landscape of movies, went far out of its way to critique the politics of the films it watched, so much so that some viewers regarded the show as "preachy."23 Television's Inevitable Victory In spite of the mirth that skewering outmoded and contemporary values can produce, these mediocre films nevertheless take their mental toll on the subjects who must watch them. The robots often complain about the quality of films that are inflicted upon them. When they must view back-to-back episodes of the plod ding 1950s serial Radar Men from the Moon, Tom Servo asks exasperatedly, "Doesn't the Geneva Convention have rules against this sort ofthing?" ("Robot Monster"), and in "Eegah," when a cute teenage girl with a beehive hairdo is encouraged by her grotesquely tanned father to make a big, singing production out of shav ing the grunting seven-foot giant Richard Kiel, Tom cries, "Joel, joel, I'm being punished for something, I know I am. I didn't askto see this movie!" The metaphor of atrocious, inescap able television as torture was made explicit in the KTMA era of the program. Although the robots cannot feel neural pain, Joel once tried to help Tom simulate the experience of pain by electrically shocking him. When lower voltages made absolutely no impression, he gave Tom an incredible electric shock that he claimed was the equivalent to watching an especially inane hour of Arsenio ("Superdonne"). Because, like children, Tom and Crow are to some degree tabulae rasae, their reactions to these anti quated products of popular culture are gener ally fresh (although some knowledge of popular culture has been conveniently programmed into them by Joel) and their judgment severe. Joel, on the other hand, who has expe rienced American pop culture for several decades, is less surprised by these horrors of taste and intelligence. For example, when outdoorsman Ross Allen (accompanied by a faithful, anonymous, conveniently silent noble savage) rather cruelly extracts animals from the Florida Everglades in the 1950 short film Catching Trouble, Joel isn't surprised and im mediately feels shame at his own culture's past ("Teenage Caveman"). Considering this adversarial attitude toward the legacy of his own culture, one would think that Joel would avoid the movie theater, but he is not free to do so, as he has been conditioned to respond to two stimuli controlled by Deep 13: the flashing siren lights of Commercial Sign and Movie Sign on the bridge of the Satellite of Love. These indicators signal segues between commercials, JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 47 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="12">Sketches, and the movie-watching experiment. When Movie Sign comes on, the swirling siren light is accompanied by a loud buzzer and the dimming of the other lights, causing a state of panic in Joel and?surely in sympathetic response?his robots as well; they rush to the theater. There is negative reinforcement as well: if Joel refuses to begin the film-watching experiment, he receives an electric shock to his posterior ("Lost Continent").24 When Joel makes the mistake of thanking the mad scientists for sending a movie that was not so terrible as the others ("Garriera"), they again deliver "a shock to the shammies," for the very nature of the MST3K experiments is cruel, if not outright sadistic, as the denizens of Deep 13 do their best to test Joel's ability to watch whatever they send him. While this is perhaps a dark science fiction scenario, the premise is rooted in real-life capitalist imperatives. David Foster Wallace reminds us, "Because of the economics of nationally broadcast, advertiser-subsidized entertainment, television's one goal?never denied by anybody in or around TV since RCA first authorized field tests in 1936?is to ensure as much watching as possible" (162). Deep 13 is in some sense an almost Foucauldian exten sion ofthat corporate media goal. If Joel is less surprised than his robots by the emptiness and shoddiness of American popular culture, having witnessed so much of it already, being forced to watch so much more badness nevertheless has its enervat ing effect on him. While Joel and his robots occasionally independently go insane during the worst movies?all of the host segments of the mind-kinking The Castle of Fu Mancha, for example, or the soul-suckingly dreadful Manos: The Hands of Fate?Joel, as our human stand-in, seems especially prone to fits, such as when he makes a slew of incompetent models of great architecture while obsessing over Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead ("Godzilla vs. the Sea Mon ster"), or when he loses his mind doing lame film pitches ("Mighty Jack"), or when his tribute to Will Rogers deteriorates into a lunacy of non sequitur allusions to speeches by others, all done in the same homespun voice ("The Killer Shrews"). In these telling moments?when Joel is in each of them hysterically attempting to as sert an independence and agency for his erod ing identity?we sense the existential tremors from our own compromised selves, the selves we have lost from being unable to imagine a world free of the stupefaction and trivialization caused by the popular media. We can also sense in these moments the ultimate futility of this show's form of textual resistance. One can talk back at one's televi sion set, but one cannot alter the agency of the media, or ultimately one's complicity in it. (As a postmodern allegory, to reject television is to reject a huge portion of experience as defined by [and for] our peers?unless one can find peers who don't watch television. I have two: one lives in Utah, the other in Iowa. We are not really a quorum.) The media, which is to say the nexus of corporations that own and profit from it, is too infinitely exhaustive to be outlasted, indefinitely outwitted even by fantabulous wits. With its incessant repetitions and general imperviousness to critique?that is, when television makes critical thought so foreign and self-mockery so ubiquitous that critique becomes popularly irrelevant?television can not be overcome with more television, no mat ter how subversive. And while the writers of A/IST3K can claim, as they explicitly do in their theme song, "It's just a show," the aesthetic force of the show derived in large part from its polemic against television as a form, and when that polemical edge dulled, the show did as well. The show began to be enervated by its own accumulating cultural weight, as allusions to previous episodes became stock-responses to current episodes (and thus became "filled with parking cars," that is, became its own numbingly repetitious form of popular culture). The show continued to weaken when its slowly rising popularity began to exert its own pres sure upon popular culture. After Joel Hodgson's departure as host (replaced by chief writer Mike J. Nelson) in 1993, the MST3K cast and 48 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="13">crew yielded to consumerist temptation and held a fan convention called, with predictable, hyperbolic irony, Conventio-Com Fest-O-Rama; it wasn't quite ironic enough in its realiza tion (basking in the adoration of its fans) to maintain the acerbic, critical integrity the show began with. After this convention, the cast and crew participated in an even more obvious and frankly gratuitous exploitation of MST3K as a brand: a Hollywood motion picture called Mys tery Science Theater: The Movie (1996). In an example of acute situational irony, one first-season episode I have on tape?recorded as a syndicated rerun?features a segue to Commercial Sign by Tom Servo mocking the influence of commercials: and the commercial that subsequently appears is for a sixth-season episode of MST3K. Each week Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and CrowT. Robot faced the theater of our accumulated bad culture, but the sense that these cheesy movies revealed anything about the media-saturated world we live in diminished. If Mystery Science Theater 3000 exhausted itself, however, the process by which it promulgated media consciousness is still viable, and is used quite effectively in half-hour doses by The Daily Show, the metashow that as a news program critiques the very way news is presented by television. Like Mystery Science Theater 3000, The Daily Show does not stop television from dominating American culture, but it does complicate that dominance, and at least temporarily seems to offer viewers a sense of aeencv in their great cultural caDtivitv. NOTES . Postman claims that if we try to read with the attention span fostered by television we would never get beyond the distractions of language's symbolic nature?how curious all these black squiggles and lines look on the page (25). Melissa Jacoby, who designed the cover of Amusing Ourselves to Death, wittily made the tail of the g in amusing wrap into the aperture of the d in death, a subtle allusion to the idea that Americans are increasingly unable to foster an epistemology of reading. 2. Incidentally, Joel Hodgson's successor as host, Mike Nelson, was a talented replacement. Nelson had been the head writer since season two. He had performed innumerable guest roles and written many witty songs for the show, and he was a much better actor and singer than Hodgson. But the media con sciousness of the show he hosted was more ironical and ambivalent (that is, less conscious) than critical. 3. The mad scientists' side-kick, TV's Frank (Frank Conniff), is killed off in episode 624 ("Sampson vs. the Vampire Women"); the mad scientist Dr. Forrester (Trace Beaulieau, also the voice of Crow T. Robot) is metaphysically done away with in episode 706 ("Las erblast"). 4. Barth returned to this subject in "The Literature of Replenishment," where the term postmodernism allowed him to distinguish which of the "certain pos sibilities" of literature were exhausted, namely "the aesthetic of high Modernism" (71). He also reminds "misreaders" (71) of the qualifications with which he approached "The Literature of Exhaustion": he was not dogmatically asserting a nihilistic or decadent program, and did not agree with those who felt that fiction could never again be vital, even if he was will ing to listen to people who thought so. Contrary to his intention, Barth is remembered as a champion of this pessimistic view, the unfortunate cost of coining this evocative, memorable phrase. 5. The ubiquity of television?in bars, gyms, air ports, waiting-rooms of all descriptions, and even at gas-station pumps?has now, almost counter intuitively, reached the cinema, once a haven from the tawdry cheapness of television. While working on this essay, I went to see Walk on Water, an Israeli film about a Mossad agent whose work, spying on innocent Germans to track down an immensely old Nazi, leads him to an understandably acute moral crisis. The cinema in Boca Raton that shows art films is owned by Regal, so this narrative about the shadow of the holocaust was prefaced by twenty minutes of NBC programming (cleverly called "The Twenty") that included a cartoon of a monstrous demon being swirl ingly schlurped down a toilet and a surreal Skittles commercial featuring kvetchy sheep-men rendered with nightmarish CGI precision?all presented at an ear-ringing one hundred five decibels, as if the audi ence were being assaulted, or punished for some thing. 6. In David Sedaris's memoir-essay "Us and Them," the divide between those who watch television and those who do not is mapped. He depicts with deft irony the condescension he felt as a child for the Tom keys, a family that "didn't believe in television" (4), a phrase he explicates for us: "Belief implied that tele vision had a master plan and that you were against it. It also suggested that you thought too much" (4). This difference made the Tomkeys both fascinating and disappointing, as he learned while walking around the neighborhood; theirs was ironically the only household that was worth watching since they weren't JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2OO7 49 ?2 7 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="14">watching television, yet their lives seemed dull be cause they were content to talk with one another, and not behave as if they were on television. While spying on them, Sedaris thought judgmentally, "They had no idea how puny their lives were, and so they were not ashamed that a camera would have found them un interesting" (5). When the Tomkeys leave for a week end trip, Sedaris says, "I felt as if my favorite show had been cancelled" (7). For him as a child, human relationships were defined by the epistemological metaphor of television, to an alarming, almost crimi nal extent (what he really wanted to see while walking about his neighborhood was a murder [4]). An even larger statement is also being made, however, one that personalizes Postman's argument about the disjunctive and stupefying nature of televi sion. When his parents discussed the Tomkeys, both his father and mother said that Mr. Tomkey might be right about television. "Then," Sedaris says, "my parents watched the news, and whatever came on after the news" (4). When the Tomkeys make a be lated Halloween visit to the Sedaris household, thus making the Sedaris children dip into their own candy booty to give to the children of this abnormal family, Sedaris binges on as much candy as he can, to hoard up his chocolate bars so that the Tomkey children cannot have them. His mother barges into his room and indignantly tells him to look at what he had done to himself. Television comes to his rescue in this mo ment of self-disgust: [l]t was hard to shake the mental picture snapped by her suggestion: here is a boy sitting on a bed, his mouth smeared with chocolate. He's a human being, but also he's a pig, surrounded by trash and gorging himself so that others may be denied. Were this the only in the world, you'd be forced to give it your full attention, but fortunately there were others. This stagecoach, for instance, coming around the bend with a cargo of gold. This shiny new Mustang convertible. This teenage girl, her hair a beautiful mane, sipping Pepsi through a straw, one picture after another, on and on until the news, and whatever came on after the news. (12) Thus television saves us from thinking too much. 7. In the same postmodern vein, Disney (which made Swiss Family Robinson in i960) has recently recast the name, using it this time for the gleaming, ideal family of the future in the sci-fi cartoon Meet the Robinsons (2007). 8. Examples of MST3ICS awareness of this cultural exhaustion are abundant, but one example?either prescient or perhaps just arising from a keen reading of Variety? seems to foreshadow much of the empti ness of American cinema today. In "Mighty Jack," Joel, in the middle of an emotional breakdown, proposes different ideas for movies based on trends at the box office. His pitches are derivative non-sequiturs, suggesting that the machinery of Hollywood is utterly haphazard. Joel notes that Steven Spielberg is plan ning to make movies based on old cartoons, such as The Flintstones (released in 1994, almost three years after this MST3K episode). Tom Servo mocks him by saying, "What's he going to do next, Casper the Friendly Ghost?" Joel responds, "Oh, don't be that ridiculous." Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment was that ridiculous, however, releasing a feature film based on the numbingly cheap 1960s cartoon in 1995. (As The Flintstones was generally reviled as one of the worst movies in cinema history, Amblin had no alternative but to make The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas [2000], a prequel meant in part to parody Elvis Presley's Viva Las Vegas [1964]. One wonders, if one is forced to think about it, where the Flintstones franchise got the nerve to parody anyone.) Joel also suggests that the subinane cartoon Josie and the Pussycats could be a viable film project. This is supposed to show how far his mental powers have deteriorated?yet Josie and the Pussycats hit cinemas in 2001. 9. Joel is, however, capable of so much oddity that Dr. Forester at one point whines, "Could we have sent a stranger person into space?" ("The Robot Monster"). 10. In "The Black Scorpion," Joel tells us, "I'm ma rooned in outer space, and now you're trapped in the vacuum with me." He makes similar opening remarks in "The Crawling Hand," "Robot Monster," "The Slime People," and "Moon Zero Two." 11. The story of Robot Holocaust is worth noting: in a postapocalyptic world, machines have enslaved human beings because the machines need someone to provide them with energy. A wise man and a clever, sexy woman know the secret behind the power of the machines, and a handsome, not-especially-emotive young hero arrives to lead them to epic victory. The name of this young hero: Neo. Really. Am I the only one who sees this film as a precursor to The Matrix (1999)? In the earlier film, a simmering rock-video goddess, Valeria (Angelika Jagger), menaces our heroes in an unreasonably bad lisp; in the later film, the besuited Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) menaces our heroes in a halting voice: these major differences aside, the similarities verge on plagiarism. The Wa chowski brothers ought to toast the hapless writer of this agglomeration of sci-fi excrement, Tim Kin caid, for writing The Matrix a dozen years before The Matrix-very, very badly. 12. A notable exception occurred in "Whiplash," when Beavis, to spice up their commentary on Korn's video for "Blind," deliberately disorients himself and produces this rather elevated discourse: "I think that the problem of this video is it is highly derivative of many popular bands within the genre. Although when viewed on its own merits, it does have a deep groove; however, what it has in groove, it lacks in originality. 50 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2007 ?2007 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="15">One can't help but be reminded of Pearl Jam, White Zombie, and Suicidal Tendencies, and other bands that bear the mantle of so-called alternative rock. One is even reminded of Laurie Anderson when she wore curlers. This video speaks less to the heart and more to the sphincter." Thus pop music critics are likened to light-headed teens. 13. An aging term that arose to signify the exhaus tion of pop culture artifacts is jumping the shark. The expression alludes to the infamous Happy Days (1974-84) episode in which the leather-clad biker, Fonzie, water-skies over a shark?a ludicrous attempt to revive the show's waning popularity. John Hein coined of the term and devotes a Web site to the phe nomenon. Not surprising in a postmodern context, however, jumping the shark itself jumped the shark at about the time Hein overexposed the idea in a book entitled Jump the Shark. 14. Cf. "The Crawling Eye," four instances; "Robot Versus the Aztec Mummy," one; "Women of the Pre historic Planet," one; "The Corpse Vanishes," two; "Robot Monster," one; "The Slime People," one; "Robot Holocaust," one; "Rocket Attack U.S.A.," two; "Mighty Jack," two; "Gamera vs. Zigra," one; "The Crash of the Moons," one. 15. TV's Frank, one of the mad scientists, also channels Frank Booth in the invention exchanges for "Catalina Caper" and "Ring of Terror," semiotically suggesting that those who help control the media and advertising are creatures that might have crept out of the darker realms of David Lynch's imagination. 16. Eyeing the futuristic go-go dancers of Moon Zero Two, Joel similarly says, "You know, I kind of miss the moon, you guys," thus significantly confusing the me diated world he is watching with the relatively actual populated world he had once inhabited. 17. Wallace, in the early 1990s, claimed, "Statisti cians report that television is watched over six hours a day in the average American household" (151). This fact, of undisclosed origin, is slightly problematic, especially as Wallace suggests often that this aver age applies to each person; in examining the term "American household" (151), he suggests that many American households are comprised of solitary peo ple, "the average U.S. lonely person" (152). For the purposes of his essay, this carries powerful rhetori cal force, and perhaps some American households in studies are comprised of the average U.S. lonely person. According to a media comparisons study in 2000 by Bruskins/Audits &amp; Surveys Worldwide, the average daily viewing per American household was seven hours and twenty-six minutes, meaning that such activity is increasing, if Wallace's statisticians are correct. But the study also breaks down view ing by gender and age, and adult men and women watched over four hours of television every day. With eight hours (probably) required for sleeping, an ad ditional eight hours (probably) required for working, most people have eight discretionary hours at their disposal, and on average they spend more than half of it watching television. Taking into account time spent grooming and commuting to work, four hours might be significantly more than half. It is not ironic that this data was found on a Web site devoted to garnering advertising for a television station {The Size and Scope of TV). 18. In fact, besides Dr. Forrester and Frank, all of the people in the U-View are celebrities, which raises the question, Is not watching television, but instead going out into the real world (as Michelle Pfeiffer does, to act in movies), supposed to make one worthy of being on television? Or is it that "rear life (hypo thetical in Frank's case) can only be depicted with materials garnered from the media (an unmediated real life being thus even more unimaginable)? 19. In this, Frank is similar to Cypher, in The Matrix, who knowingly chooses a simulated life over the pain ful, prosaic complexities of the real world. This is also similar to "Tired," a Beavis and Butthead episode in which the protagonists watch a music video so lame that they actually turn the television off for a minute; in their discomfort they soon return to the very same video, thankful that television, however lame, at least mediates their experience of one another. Few televi sion viewers would consciously make that choice, I think, but few television viewers ever have to make it consciously, explicitly. 20. The writers of MST3K were so thrilled by this epitaph that, after hearing it in the movie, they had joel and the robots listen to it once more on the SOL, then had the mad scientists listen to it in Deep 13, and then played it for a fourth time over the show's closing credits. I myself am bravely resisting the temptation to reproduce the speech here. 21. Newitz mentions MST3K but does not investi gate its importance to cheese because her primary texts are blaxploitation films and Godzilla movies. Because MST3?CS cultural commentary is so hetero geneous and because so many of its films are white oriented, moments of cheese as Newitz defines the term (cheap, non-white depictions of Pacific Rim eth nicity, nationalism, and race) are hard to find in the show. Exceptions include the string of Japanese films, including two Godzilla and four of Gamera, the giant, mutated turtle; the sci-fi action-dramas Fugitive Alien I and II; and the almost inexplicable espionage narra tive Mighty lack. If MST3K has a particular weakness, it is for Asian clich?s. In "Gamera vs. Barugon," for example, they ridicule white imperialism when a heli copter lands on a Polynesian island and Joel yells over the whirring blades, "Hi, we're from America. We've come to decimate your jungle, convert your youth, and make you feel inferior." Yet despite this outrage, their sympathy for Asian and Pacific Rim cultures is largely abstract, as many of their jokes demonstrate. For example, when someone speaks of cargo, Tom JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 59-4 / WINTER 2OO7 5I ?2 7 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="16">says, "Crutch Cargo," referingto the cheap 1959 car toon series (in which moving lips are superimposed on still cartoons, an effect popular today on Late Night with Conan O'Brien), but he speaks the words as if mispronounced by a Japanese person. When traditional koto music is playing, Tom says, "I never knew a cheese-cutter could sound that good." When a strange, somewhat realistic fight between two men breaks out, Joel asks, "Shouldn't one of them know kung fu?" And Crow, in the opening credits, says of a Japanese name, "Hey, I think I see my laundry," thus confusing Chinese and Japanese clich?s. In "Mighty Jack," when one character is in Paris, Joel, Tom, and Crow imitate the distinctive notes of the koto playing the melody of "An American in Paris"?and Joel guilt ily asks if doing so is "kind of racist." Tom Servo an swers no, and in the sense that no culture on MST3K is regarded as superior, including our own, Japan is not singled out. But this approach to cheese does invite charge of social insensitivity, even in a context of provisional cultural Judgments. 22. Royer offers a sweeping, scathing attack on what was one of the most liberal shows on televi sion because the answer to the question "Does this program's humor live up to its highest political po tential?" (117) is no, even though the leftist political edge of the show at times bordered on overbearing for many viewers. While Royer is not only critiquing MST3ICS gender politics, but also extrapolating from that to the gender politics of our national culture, her argument, I think, is undermined both by factual mistakes?she claims, for example, that the host and the robots don't know their experiments are being watched (119,120), and that veteran writer Mary Jo Pehl Joined the staff of the show in season seven (118), when she had been working on that staff since season four?and by her plodding, heavy-handed tone, such as when she salaciously calls the host and his two robot sidekicks "three masculine voyeurs" (115)?cinema being somehow an invasion of an actor's privacy, apparently. Her cultural critique, inci dentally, is founded upon an exhaustive study of two whole episodes. 23. While watching "Lost Continent," made by Lip pert Productions, the same company that made "Jun gle Goddess," the reluctant Crow and Tom behave like stand-ins for such viewers when Joel incorporates the imperialist attitudes of both films into the context of a television drama produced by the formulaic Quinn Martin, who brought us The Fugitive, The Streets of San Francisco, and BarnabyJones, among others. Implicitly, the smug, cornball world-view of those programs is equated with that of the Lippert films. 24. Thus the enforced watching of films, which was, in the Ludivico technique of Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, a means by which subjects could be conditioned to feel revulsion at destructive impulses, becomes, in MST3K, literally the end. The social, moral good that was the "higher purpose" of depriving people of their psychological and physi ological sovereignty has yielded to the amorality of the capitalist incentives to put "meat in the seats" (17), as HunterS. Thompson put it. Thus, television, and so very much else of popular culture, appeals to our collective cultural ass rather than to any other, perhaps more elevated, portion of our anatomy.
