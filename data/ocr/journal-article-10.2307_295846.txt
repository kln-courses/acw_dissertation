By MRS. S. ARTHUR STRONG, D.Litt. LL.D. (Plates I-XI I.) Now at length it became easy to discern the true character of the Roman Empire. Our horizon broadened beyond the backstairs of the Palatine and the benches of the Curia to wide lands north and east and south of the Mediterranean, and we began to realize the achievements of the Empire -its long and peaceable government of dominions extending into three continents, its gifts of civiliza- tion, language, and citizenship to almost all its subjects, its creation of a stable and coherent order out of which rose the Europe of to-day. The old theory of an age of despotism and decay was over- thrown. The believer in human nature could now feel confident that, whatever their limitations and defects, the men of the Empire wrought for the progress and happiness of the world. (F. Haver- field, Preface to Mommsen's Provinces of the Roman Empire, Eng. trans. I909). This year the Italians celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of Rome as capital of United Italy. Apt as usual to seize the appropriate idea, they decided to mark the occasion in Rome herself by an exhibition that should not merely'display the growth of present Italian art and industries, or afford hospitality to the art of other nations, but should set forth besides in visible monuments the former glory of Rome, the wide'range of empire ruled by the Eternal City, which, again a capital, is again the centre of a strong national life. Thus arose that unique feature of Rome's I9II Exhibition, the Mostra Archeologica in the baths of Diocletian. The scheme of this section, as originally unfolded by Professor Lanciani at a meeting of the British School of Rome in the spring of this year, was limited to the life of the Roman provinces, whose chief monuments, whether in situ or in museums, were to be represented by casts and models, drawings and photographs. This programme has been adhered to in the main, in spite of certain later additions and accretions. The organising committee of the exhibition were happily inspired when they allotted to the archaeological section, not some common- place building erected for the purpose, but the splendid halls of the baths of Diocletian, recently freed of their modern disfigure- ments. That is the spot of all others where our mood seems best attuned to study and to understand the phenomena presented. Certainly an exhibition mainly intended to illustrate the relations of Rome to her provinces could not be more suitably lodged than in halls erected by the astute emperor who checked the signs of decay in the provincial system, who remodelled its divisions, and who thereby infused into the system a fresh vitality, which, if some- what artificial, yet prolonged its existence for several centuries. The baths, which have lately been made the subject of a special</page><page sequence="14">2 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE study by Commendatore Rivoira, 1 were built in the incredibly short period between Ist May, 305, and 24th July, 306, when Diocletian and Maximian had already abdicated. The story of their abandonment and gradual decay, and of their fate in the middle ages and the renaissance, has been told by Lanciani in his Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome (pp. 434, f.). 2 In i563-1566 a Carthusian monastery and cloister were built over the greater part of the huge frigidarium, while the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, planned by Michel Angelo, saved the central hall, known as the tepidarium, in its entirety. As recently as I889, the cloister was converted into the Museo Nazionale delle Terme, but the parts occupied neither by the church nor by the cloister had of late years fallen into a wretched condition of neglect and decay. In I907, at the instigation of Corrado Ricci, always on the watch to improve the national monuments over which he presides with intelligent zeal, a law was passed allowing the expropriation of the miserable hovels which disfigured the ruins; in the Rassegna d'Arte of I908, Ricci put forward a scheme for the " systematisation " of the Thermae, which was vigorously pushed forward and brought to a conclusion a few months ago. It is within the noble spaces thus won back for art and science that the Archaeological Exhibition has been arranged. The plan given as frontispiece to the excellent " short catalogue " makes the distribution of the exhibits clear. In what follows I shall limit myself to the material presented by the exhibition. My main object is to provide a commentary to the monuments and to the catalogue, whose only fault is that it is too short. 3 But I shall at the same time attempt here and there to indicate lines of research suggested by the monuments exhibited, which students could, I believe, follow out with advantage. The few criticisms are offered in the confident belief that the exhibition, which is in any case to remain open for several months longer, will eventually be established on a permanent basis, so that weak points can be strengthened and omissions rectified. New exhibits are, I am told, arriving almost daily. ROMA AETERNA (catalogue, p. 23). The first two rooms, dedicated respectively to " Roma Aeterna" and to the " Imperium Romanum," form a prelude to the whole. The exhibition is of the Roman provinces, and an attempt to 1 Journal of (he British and American Archaeo- logical Society, I9 II, p. 353, ff; cf. also Rivoira's Lombardic Architecture (transl.

But that the dependence of the provinces upon the central dominion of Rome may be borne in mind from the outset, room I is appropriately dedicated to the Urbs. A striking group of images of the " Dea Roma " is formed by the Cesi statue from the cortile of the Palazzo dei Conservatori (an Athena arbitrarily made into a Roma by a seventeenth-century restorer), which dominates this room from a niche in the central wall and the two fine busts in the Louvre which flank it. The statue from Delos, said to be one of the best presentments of Roma, is promised, but has not yet arrived. We miss any copy of the famous Barberini picture'; we miss also casts from the series of republican and imperial coins with Roma on the reverse; the opportunity, moreover, might be utilised for taking and exhibiting casts of the narrow friezes of the arch of Septimius Severus, where Roma, seated, receives the offerings of conquered peoples (A.D. 203). Viewed merely as a symbol of the imperial city, these allegories are not without artistic merit and a calm majesty suited to the subject. Yet if we search beneath the outward form for the inspiring idea, we at once perceive how devoid the Romans were of that anthropomorphic imagination which led the Greeks to their greatest triumphs in art. The eponymous goddess, originally imposed upon the Romans by Greek historiographers, always remained a frigid and remote abstrac- tion; her epithet aeterna shows that she was conceived of as of different substance to the immortal gods, a fact vividly brought before us here by an altar from Locri in room i, inscribed I.O.M. deis deabusque immortalibus et Romae aeternae Locrenses.2 This effigy of Roma, a compound of the Greek Athena and the Greek Amazon, was (it is true) touched, if not to life, still to a certain radiant splendour, when associated with the cult of the emperor, as in the superb Gemma Augustea at Vienna, reproduced in the Austrian section. But at no time was it animated by a really human conception or motive such as enabled a follower of Lysippus to impart its life-like effect and its vibrating lines to that most exquisite of all antique personifications, the " Tyche " of Antioch, known to us from the copy in the Vatican. About "Roma" are grouped representations of the myths con- nected with the foundation and origin of Rome, mainly from the Augustan and Hadrianic periods, showing the efforts made by Augustus and later by Hadrian to impose upon the Romans concrete mythological concepts of their legendary past. The original marble intarsia with Romulus and Remus nurtured by the wolf, in the possession of Prince Colonna, is here exhibited (fig. I). 3 It is in three I Matz-Duhn, Antike Bildwerke, iii, 41 1 1 1. 2 C..L. x, T6. 3 Tomassetti, Riomische Mittheilungen, i, I886, plate i. T. Ashby, Papers of the British School at Rome, v, 284.

A cast of the famous " Tiber" in the Louvre, once the pendant of the even more famous " Nile" in the Vatican, is also here; the original had been taken to the Louvre by Napoleon and after the restitutions of i8i6 it remained in Paris as a " gift " of Pius VII to Louis XVIII. On its plinth is carved a series of scenes referring to the arrival of Aeneas in Latium. Art, mood and theme are all in the happiest Virgilian vein; we are in the midst of the life and poetry of Latium, from Alba, characterised by the sow and her young, to the Tyrrhene shore, from the mouths of the Tiber to the Rio Torto and the Incastro; river harbour gods disport themselves in their own FIG.

I67). A magnificent plan of Rome covers a whole wall in room i. It is by M. Chedanne, former " pensionnaire " of the French Academy at the Villa Medici, the work of whose architects we often have cause to admire in the exhibition. The grand model of imperial Rome by M. Paul Bigot, another " pensionnaire," is exhibited in a neighbouring hall of the Thermae (plate i). It shows the city as it was in the fourth century of our era, on the ample and luxurious scale of I to 400 and one can well believe that it took seven years to complete. IMPERIUM ROMANUM (cat. p. 27). The vast sweep of the Roman dominion is brought vividly before us by the series of Roman milestones and inscriptions from all parts of the empire arranged in this room. Here too is a fine repro- duction of the oldest known map of the world, the famous Tabula Peutingeriana preserved in Vienna. The inscription in honour of Julian, now walled in at Ancyra, which records how in " one summer " the emperor travelled from the Britannic Ocean to the Tigris, is an impressive picture of Roman power and of imperial activity as late as 362 A.D. 2 The personifications of conquered provinces in room II have the same cold remoteness which we notice in the conception of Roma. Even the graceful figures which adorn the high podium of the Hadrianeum, 3 a portion of which is here shown restored (plate i i), lack artistic fire and emotion. It is not, as a fact, to these abstractions, clothed in forms borrowed from decadent Hellenism, that we must look for the true conception which the Romans formed of the peoples brought under their sway. That we must seek in the splendid figures and heads of captive barbarians, which may be studied in this same room; in the groups of conquered peoples along the Aurelian column4; above all on the Trajan column, in such episodes as the submission of the Dacians to Trajan at the end of the first war, or in that scene of the second war, where the Dacian chiefs, within the walls of Sarmizegetusa, prefer poison to surrender. 5 1 Sieveking in Oesterr.

AUGUSTuS (cat. p. 35)- After the Urbs and the Imperium, the place of honour belongs naturally to Augustus, founder of the empire, who is represented here by the noblest of his portraits, the togate statue discovered in June of last year on the Via Labicana, within the city (plate iii). It shows him in the attitude of pontifex maximus, with thoughtful intellectual features such as Virgil might have created, had he been sculptor instead of poet. There is likewise here a good selection of other portraits of Augustus, including the busts from Munich, Vienna, Arles, the British Museum, Boston, etc. The latest addition is the cast of the bronze portrait head of Augustus, lately discovered by Professors Sayce and Garstang, at Meroe in the Soudan, and now in the British Museum. The head is of singular beauty and it also possesses high historic value. It comes midway in date between the bust of the young Octavian in the Vatican and the Prima Porta and Via Labicana statues. It represents Augustus at about the age of thirty, at the period, that is, when Egypt was formally made over to him as a prize of conquest, to form part of his own personal domain without interference from the senate (30 B.C.). The statue to which the head belonged was doubtless placed in a temple or other public building, and it has been suggested that queen Candace may have pilfered it in her raid upon Egypt in 27 B.C. The cast has been presented by the English government through the " Comitato Inglese," that is, the committee of the British Section in the International Fine Arts Exhibtion. Owing to exigencies of space, the Ara Pacis, the most important of extant Augustan monuments, the one which affords so vivid a picture of Augustus and of the men and women who surrounded him, is not in this room but at the other end of the exhibition (XXI. cat. p. I64). Even there, only a small corner of the altar has been reconstructed, and that not correctly, since friezes that run parallel are placed at right angles (cat. p. i66). Not even a model on a reduced scale is shown to give an idea of the whole. True, the original slabs which belong to the Museo delle Terme are exhibited,1 together with casts of the slabs in the Vatican and 1 With the exception, however, of the superb slab (found in the latest excavation under the Palazzo Fiano) upon which Dr. Sieveking has identified the portrait of Augustus; see F. Stud- niczka, Zur Ara Pacis, pl. iii, x, and iv, p. 9I6, f.</page><page sequence="19">ROMAN EMPIRE, AT THE BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN, ROME. 7 at Florence and Paris. But why should not all of these have been put together ? Do the Italians wish not to call attention to the fact that the splendid relief with the Flamines1 is still allowed to remain under water beneath the Palazzo Fiano ? Yet a full 00 0 reconstruction of the Ara Pacis would probably prove more per- suasive than any words to bring about the restitution to Italy of the slabs belonging to museums outside Italy or Rome. T"here are rumours that the exhibition may stay open till next spring ; 1 Strong, Roman Sculpture, pl. IS.</page><page sequence="20">8 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE is it too late to hope that the reconstruction may yet be attempted in some of the large open spaces of the Thermae ? Not second in importance to the Ara Pacis as illustrating the Augustan age, is the temple of Ancyra in Galatia, one of the spots where the cult of "'Roma " was first associated with that of the emperor (cat. p. I74). As might be expected from the region where the temple lies, the architecture is Hellenistic, a Corinthian temple in antis with delicate frieze of acanthus scrolls and dainty figures of victories (fig. 2). The cella once had a remarkable decora- tion consisting of a painted frieze between two cornices and swags that hung free from the lower moulding. These swags have been broken off and are now only traceable by the knots of the ribbons which held them. 1 When we remember that the temple was turned into a Byzantine church, the apse of which is still standing, that a Turkish cemetery is lodged in the cella, that a Turkish mosque is built against its left wall and Turkish houses against its right, we must admire the devotion and patient industry which enabled Signor Beretti and his workmen to bring away drawings and casts of every single detail, and so to give in plaster a more complete image of the temple than could be obtained in Ancyra itself. Many will feel a glow of emotion at reading in exact facsimile within the vestibule, the inscription to which the temple owes its fame; the copy of the Res Gestae of Augustus which were inscribed in Rome on the bronze pillars outside his mausoleum. The Greek translation, with the help of which much of the Latin inscription has been restored, runs along the lower course of the outer right wall and is admirably legible in the cast. The temple has been reconstructed just outside the exhibition, in a charming garden to the right of the entrance to the museum. THE MONUMENT OF PYDNA (cat. p. I69). As we re-enter the exhibition, we pass, in the centre of the hall of the Ara Pacis, the cast (cat. p. I69, with illustr.) of the monument put up at Delphi by Aemilius Paulus after the battle of Pydna (i68 B.C.). It is a gaunt rectangular pillar, adorned only with the modest little *frieze carved with battle scenes that are almost in- visible at so great a height, which runs under the capital2; on its front face it bears the simple Roman dedication: L. Aimilius L(ucii) f(ilius) imperator de rege Perse[o] Macedonibusque cepet. 3 The pillar carried an equestrian statue of Aemilius, a tentative restoration 1 I am indebted to Signor Beretti, the draughts- man of the Museo delle Terme and of the mission that was sent to Ancyra, for this explanation of the ornament of the frieze of the cella. IThe frieze and its subject have been recently discussed by A. J. Reinach, Bull. Cor. Hell. xxxiv, 1910, pp. 433-468. 3 C.I.L. iii, 14203, 22.</page><page sequence="21">ROMAN EMPIRE, AT THE BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN, ROME. 9 of which by a French architect, M. Albert Tournaire, is among the plates of the Fouilles de Delphes.' The monument is synchronous with the memorable grand tour through the principal cities of Greece, which Aemilius undertook after Pydna in the company of his second son, the future conqueror of Carthage and Numantia. It marks, nearly twenty years before Greece was finally reduced to the Roman province of Achaia, the growing philhellenism of distinguished Romans and is one of the earliest attempts extant to adopt Greek art-forms to Roman concepts, and this in Greece itself. ALTAR OF AHENOBARBUS, ARCH OF SUSA, AQUILEIA, POLA. The reliefs of a quadrangular basis or altar (cat. p. 36) from the temple of Neptune, which commemorated the maritime exploits of Gn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, show that by the end of the republic this Hellenisation of Roman art-subjects was a fait accompli. The reliefs of the front and sides with the " Nuptials of Poseidon and Amphitrite " and the " Sacrifice to Mars " on the back of the structure2 are, like the reliefs of the Ara Pacis, in the direct Hellenic tradition. If we look up from these friezes to the casts of those from the arch of Augustus at Susa in the Cottian Alps, on a wall immediately behind (cat. p. 36), we shall at once appre- ciate the difference between the elegant art of the monument of Domitius or of the Ara Pacis, produced under the influence of Greek models, and the rough and primitive manner found in parts of the Empire, which, like the little kingdom of Cottius, had not felt Greek tradition. Now for the first time it becomes possible, without going to Susa, 3 to study this provincial sculpture, which forms so striking a contrast to the Roman imperial art of the same period. When we look at the scenes of sacrifice on the north and south sides of the arch with their iteration of identical gestures, or at the group on the west side of king Cottius and Augustus signing their treaty, we are reminded not of contemporary Graeco-Roman art unintelli- gently imitated by provincial stone-cutters, but of a primitive art innocent of modelling and of foreshortening. It is, however, by no means peculiar to Susa. We find it again at Adamklissi in the Dobrudja (see below) and on countless Roman tombstones throughout the empire. The late Adolf Furtwangler, in his papers 1 Tome ii, fasc. i, plate xvi. 2 For Furtwangler's discovery that the three friezes with marine deities in Munich and the Louvre slab with the " Sacrifice " belong together, see his Intermezzi, I896, PP. 35, ff, and Beschrei- bung der Glyptotek under no. 239. Domaszewski has since shewn (Abhandlungen zur romischen Religion, p. 230) that the sacrifice is in honour of Mars, who is represented on the left of the altar; but the early date proposed by him for the reliefs is untenable. Sieveking (Oesterr. Yabreshefte, xii, i910, p. 98, ff.) allots the reliefs, not to an altar in front of the temple, but to the basis within the temple that supported the group by Skopas (Plin. N.H. xxvi, z6). 3 The reliefs were first published in I9OI by E. Ferrero, L'arc d'Auguste a Suse; see also C. Esperandieu, Bas-Reliels de la Gaule Romaine, iv pp. I 3-20.</page><page sequence="22">10 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE on the monument of Adamklissi, had the signal merit of defining this art and of tracing it back to the influence of the Roman legions of whose tombstones, he thinks, it is specially characteristic. 1 Furt- wangler's only error, in my judgment, was in not pushing his theory far enough. This art introduced by the legions was not restricted to Italy outside Rome and to the provinces, but is, in t;he main, the primitive art of Rome, such as we may study it in the sepulchral reliefs of the republic2 where it survives untouched, save occasionally in external details, by the Hellenic current. It comes again to the fore in the second and third centuries of the empire, when men had tired of the Greek ideal in art, and in Rome itself it finally supplants the Graeco-Roman manner in the Diocletianic friezes of the arch of Constantine. 3 Certainly the " largesse " (or congiarium) and the " harangue " of that arch, resemble the scene of Cottius and Augustus on the reliefs from Susa much more closely than does any contemporary Augustan sculpture. To the right of the friezes of Susa may be seen facsimiles of the fragments of the inscription of the Tropaeum Alpium set up by Augustus in B.C. 6-7 at La Turbie, to record the subjection of the Alpine tribes to the rule of Rome. The full text of the inscription is given by Pliny (N.H. iii, I36); the remaining fragments were removed to the Musee de Saint-Germain in I869. These monu- ments from the western fringe of ancient Italy are balanced on the opposite wall by exhibits which represent the monuments and sculpture of Aquileia and Pola on its eastern border, and the whole thus affords a picture of the 'fines Italiae' and forms at the same time a happy transition from the sections we have just considered to those dedicated exclusively to the provinces. The numerous casts and photographs that illustrate the culture of Aquileia and Pola are the gift of the Austrian government (cat. Pp. 38-44). Among the Aquileian exhibits are the lovely altar of Priapus, and the circular medallions with Silenus and Pan from the monument of the Fufidii, all purely in the Hellenistic manner. Among the many Roman portraits found at Aquileia and represented here, is one of singular beauty, a female head with veil and stephane, said to be the empress Livia. Among the objects from Pola is a cast of the recently discovered fragment showing a barbarian half kneeling at the foot of an emperor (cat. p. 42) and a number of casts of the details of the beautiful arch of the Sergii. 1 See especially Das Tropaion von Adamklissi u. provinzial-romiscbe Kunst in Abbandl. der k. bayer.

I I DACIA INFERIOR (first Roumanian section, cat. PP. 70-74). 1 A cast of about one-third of the great circular trophy of Adam- klissi, which has afforded a clue to the understanding of much pro- vincial art, is placed against the right wall of the fourth room. This reconstruction is all the more welcome as it enables us to study the sculptures, now in the museum of Bucharest, within their archi- tectural setting. The great cylinder is, like the sculptures, purely Roman in character; it is that shape of circular tomb, familiar from the mausolea of Hadrian and of Augustus in Rome, from the tomb of Caecilia Metella on the Via Appia, or that of the Plautii on the Via Tiburtina and numerous other examples, which may be traced back to the urne a capanna of the Latin and Roman sepol- creti, and through these to the primitive round wattled hut, which thus survived for the habitation of the dead, as it did for the House of Vesta. As regards the date, no satisfactory arguments have, in my opinion at least, yet been brought forward to weaken Furtwangler's assumption that the monument of Adamklissi commemorated the conquest of Moesia by M. Licinius Crassus in B.C. 29-28.2 True, the style of the sculptures is no more distinctively Augustan than it is Trajanic; as we learn more of the art intro- duced by the legions, we perceive that it lasts with practically little variation to the close of the empire. It may, however (in contra- diction to the exhibition catalogue) be asserted of the sculptures of Adamklissi, that they have nothing in common, save an occasional subject, with those of the Trajan column. In the small model of the whole, after Professor Niemann of Vienna, it is regrettable that the trophy that crowns the monument was not produced from Furtwangler's corrected version which has been accepted even by Studniczka.3 DALMATIA, PANNONIA, DACIA, MOESIA, ETC. (Austro-Hungarian section, cat. pp. 45-70). The rest of the fourth room is occupied by the Austro-Hungarian section, probably the best equipped and organised in the whole exhibition. In it are represented the provinces of Illyricum, Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Dacia Superior. The most notable monument in Dalmatia is, of course, the palace of Dio- cletian at Spalato, which owes its preservation amid the squalor 1 Organized by Professors Tzigara-Samurcas, Onciul and Parvan.

Ernest Hebrard, which won the gold medal in the Paris Salon of I9WO (fig. 3). It is accompanied by magnificent drawings of the actual site and buildings, by restored elevations, and sections taken through the palace in various directions. In front of these models, due to foreign enterprise and skill, we cannot forget that the first serious impulse was given to the study of Spalato by an English architect, Robert Adam, whose splendid re- constitution of the palace, published more than a century and a half ago, 3 still compares favourably with the essays based on modern re-examination of the ruins. Nor shall we incur the reproach of chauvinism if we regret that where an Englishman led the way, no Englishmen should have followed, and that the noble task of reconstituting Spalato, to whose beauty and importance, more- over, our architect-historian Freeman repeatedly called attention in some of his most vigorous and characteristic pages,4 should now have passed entirely into the hands of foreign archaeologists. On the left as we enter room iv, in the vitrine which contains a number of smaller objects from various Austrian museums (including the Gemma Augustea from Vienna), attention should be paid to the remarkable bronze head of a personage of the Antonine period, not long ago discovered at Wels in Upper Austria. Casts are now obtainable and should soon find their way to our English cast-museums. The series of monuments from Pannonia and Noricum illustrated by casts sent by Austria and by Hungary is of unparalleled interest. Here are plans and photographs of all the most recent .and important excavations ; those of Haidrin near Pettau in Styria, of the Roman Aquincum (near Buda-Pest), of the fortress of Carnuntum (on the Danube below Vienna) etc. The two great cults of Mithras and of Jupiter Dolichenus which the Roman armies brought from Syria with other cognate cults, are illustrated by the two reliefs from the first and second mithraea at Haidrin; by the relief of Jupiter Dolichenus and Isis and by the relief of the Nutrices Augustae, both from Klagenfurt; by various monuments to Jupiter Dolichenus from Carnuntum, and by the magnificent mithraic slab from Aquileia.

It marks the recognition of Mithraism as the cult of the state only four years before the date when Constantine, one of the dedicants, saw the vision of the Cross. A cast of a notable relief, from Serajevo, with the curious " mithraic communion," may be seen in the next room. 1 In the centre two mystae,2 one of whom holds the drinking-horn, recline on a couch at the table with the bread, amid four com- municants, each wearing the mask appropriate to his grade of initiation; on the left are the crow (korax) and the Persian (Perses), on the right the soldier (miles) and the lion (leo). The art-type is imitated from the banquet scene familiar on Greek tombstones. But the mithraic communion may possibly have reacted in its turn on the funeral banquet, and imparted to it a mystic significance which would help to explain its frequent appearance on Roman provincial stelae. 3 To the archaeologist and to the student of Roman art the great value of this section rests in the superb series of sepulchral monu- ments which throw much light both on the art of the provinces and on the religious beliefs of the time. The numerous stelae of the soldiers are of the character already referred to ; the dead man in his military accoutrement is shewn at full length, or only to the waist, facing the spectator frontally. 4 Both types were also adapted for the sepulchral slabs of civilians and eventually passed into christian art. A singular charm attaches to the stele put up, as is recorded in the pathetic inscription, 5 by one Marcus Aurelius I F. Cumont, Mysteres de Mitbra, i, 175, f, and fig io. The relief was found at Konjica; like the relief from Heddernheim (Cumont, 251), the Konjica example probably also turned on a pivot, so that we may imagine the scene of the reverse to have been brought before the faithful at a given moment of the service, probably that of conse- cration and communion. For the fragment of a second mithraic communion see the same writer in Rev. Arcbhol. xl, 1902, p. I0, figs. I and 2. 2 Mr. H. Stuart-Jones kindly informs me that, in his opinion, these two figures represent the Heliodromus (Sun's messenger, Cumont, i, 315) and the pater (i.e. the priest as direct representative of the god, see Dieterich, Mitbrasliturgie, p. 1io). He further communicates to me the suggestion of Mr. Phythian Adams, of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to the effect that the figure interpreted by Cumont, i, 176 as the soldier, miles, is more probably a cryphius. Mr. Adams holds, it seems, that miles, if a grade at all, was the lowest, the ordinary member of the congregation; and that the initiated were of six grades only, corax, crvpbius, leo, persa, beliodromus, pater. 3 On the significance of the sacramental repast in later cults generally see A. Dieterich, Mithras- liturgie, p. i02. 4 The best discussion of the Pannonian grave- reliefs that has yet appeared is by H. Hofmann, Romische Militargrabsteine der Donauldnder (Son- derschrilten des Oesterr. Arch. Issst. I905), cf. the same writer's article in Oesterr.

The figure represents a Roman officer of foreign nationality with heavy moustache and bushy eye- brows (fig. 4). He wears the Roman accoutrement, linen tunic leather jerkin with tabs, cuirass, and military cloak or paludamentum, while the balteus crosses his breast and once held a now vanished sword of bronze. The curious helmet with its high curling feathers is difficult to parallel exactly from other representations but re- sembles the crested centurion's helmet on two stelae from Poetovio and Carnuntum respectively, which are likewise represented in the exhibition. 2 At the officer's feet on the left is a bundle of rotuli; the right fore-arm is raised, and the two middle fingers are extended in the gesture of allocutio, afterwards borrowed for the christian act of benediction. Although worked in the round, the figure is kept flat with little or no modelling. In effective contrast to this somewhat clumsy figure are the superb portrait medallions from the museums of Klagenfurt and of Gratz3 (plate IV) which show that art was striking root in the provinces, and that a real school of sculpture was growing out of the primitive forms introduced by the legions. Masterpieces such as the medallion of a man and his wife from Klagenfurt, or the portrait of a Roman centurion from Gratz would have long ago attracted admiration if they had adorned a mediaeval church. Being Roman works of the second century, they have been only discussed from an antiquarian standpoint with scarce an allusion to their style. 4 Yet here we are far enough from the insipidity of Graeco-Roman art; we already feel ourselves among men who in time will contribute to the great sculptures of mediaeval Europe. And in the drawing of the faces there is a vigour of line that is worthy of Holbein. In stelae with medallion portraits, the dead man often appears within a laurel wreath which has been explained as the soldier's corona triumphalis. But on the stelae under discussion it acquires, I think, a further significance as emblem of the victory of the dead over the spirits of evil. 5 In the two medallions from Gratz, more- over, the symbolism is carried still further. They are crowned by I RKdmische Bildwerke einheimischen Fundorts, iii, pl. xi-xii, and pp. 5-8 (in Denkschrilten der Wiener Akademie der Wissenschaften, xxvii, }878). 2 Stelc of Petronius Classicus from Poetovio, cat. p. 56; Hofmann, p. 27 and fig.

He was the youth who from a self-inflicted death awoke to a new life and to perfect union with the divinity. His cult received fresh force under the influence of Mithraism, and appears on countless gravestones, where his figure is, I believe, expressive of the hope of resurrection (cf. the stelae from Klausenburg, cat. p. 63). 1 So, too, his pine-cone, like the cross on a christian grave, must be symbolical of the belief in life after death.2 No other explanation can adequately account for the universality of the symbol. 3 In the medallion of the centurion, an eagle with outspread wings fills the space between gable and wreath. This image, like that of the wreath, seems to combine two thoughts; we should certainly be justified in explaining it as the eagle of the Roman legions; at the same time the motive may also be influenced by that of the eagle bearing a wreath, which appears on gravestones in Hierapolis and elsewhere in Syria, and which Cumont in his recent brilliant paper on the Imperial Apotheosis has shown to be the eagle that bears away the soul towards the radiant spaces of heaven. 4 The same preoccupation with life after death may be studied in a number of stelae whose decoration is drawn from a restricted group of Graeco-Roman myths reproduced as being susceptible of spiritual interpretation rather than for any interest in their art- forms, which are clumsily imitated in a poor or rough technique. The story of Rhea Silvia and of Mars, which occurs, for instance, on a sarcophagus from Aquincum,5 now in the museum of Buda-Pest (cat. pp. 65, 66) and on the west pediment of the Igel column near 1 See K6rber, Mainzer Zeitschrilt, iii, 3 ; H. Hepding, Attis und seine Mythen, 1903, p. 202. The monuments are collected by F. Cumont, Notice sur un Attis funeraire in Bulletin de 1' Institut Archeologique Liegeois, xxix, I90I, pp. 65- 73 ; see also his Mithras, ii, 437, and his article Attis in Pauly-Wissowa. The opinion of Bruno Schroder, Bonner Jahrbiicher, I08-I09 (p. 75, note) that the " so-called " Attis figures have nothing to do with Attis and that in sepulchral Roman art these figures are employed " rein als Zierrat," is in my opinion, absolutely inadmissible. 2 Schroder, op. cit. p. 74, refers to this explanation of the pine-cone only to reject it and believes that the pine-cone represents omphalos and tumulus. J. Strzygowski (Dom zu Aachen, p. 20, f. and Rom. Mittheil, xviii, I903, p. I85, ff.) has shown that in Syriac MSS. and miniatures the pine-cone, with water spurting from it, is the symbol of the fountain of life, an observation that confirms the significance attached above to the pine-cones on tombs. There are numerous examples of these pine or fir-cones in Britannia, from the crowning of graves; e.g. Bruce. Lapid. Sept. p. 457, no. 9I0 (found at Papcastle), where the cone is rightly explained as the symbol of a " hope of a life be- yond the grave." For cognate meanings attached to the pine-cone, see W. A. L. Elmslie, The Mishna: on Idolatry, in Texts and Studies, viii, 19ii, 2, p. 9 and note. 3 The monument from Klausenburg (not pub- lished) is typical and confirms the meaning attri- buted above to the Attis figures and the pine-cone. On the front are portraits of the deceased surmounted by the apotropaic gorgon ; on the left is a figure of Attis, and above a dolphin vyoXo7rokr6s6; to the right is a female figure, probably another deceased member of the f'amily, and above an eagle bearing a wreath ; the whole is crowned.by the pine-cone. Equally convincing is a sepulchral niche from Maros-Nemeti (cat. p. 70), where the horse-shoe panel that contains the busts of the deceased is surmounted by dolphin and pine-cone. 4 This was undoubtedly the meaning of the eagle within a wreath, grasping a fish(?) in his claws, surmounted by the face of Sol Sanctis- simus on the lost stele.

Loewy in a lecture in May, I9II.</page><page sequence="30">I8 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE Trier, applies effectively to death, for death is itself but a sleep which leads to a blessed awakening and consolation. Again, Orpheus is frequiently represented on tombs of this period, as on the large monument in the market-place of Pettau (cat. p. S6). Who better than Orpheus, who had descended to Hades to obtain a soul's release, could express the hopes of an after-life ?1 Was he not moreover represented in the Orphic system as teaching the doctrine of immortality ? In the pediment of this same Pettau monument we find Venus and Adonis, with unmistakable reference to resurrection, while the Dionysiac figures of the sides are em- blematic of the joys that await the dead in their eternal dwelling. The Dioscuri, likewise, who alternately participate in life and death,2 must be understood as an image of future life. The myth of Hercules, one or more of whose labours is frequently represented, is symbolic of the trials and victory of the soul, and the same, I imagine, was the meaning that attached to the image of the wandering Aeneas, found so frequently on the graves of the districts along the Danube and the Rhine. 3 In short, nowhere better than in these stelae can we follow the spiritual ideals that were spreading from the East to the western provinces of the empire, largely through the influence of the legions. Like that of the christian tombs of a somewhat later date, their icono- graphy is an illuminating commentary on the beliefs of the time. However crude their symbolism, however naive their images or rude their art, these stelae consistentlv offer to the living the supreme guarantee that death is not irrevocable. Their distinctive note is defiance of death and assertion of life beyond the grave. We seem to read here the challenge of the apostle, " 0 death where is thy sting ? 0 grave, where is thy victory ? " They mark a definite reaction from Cicero's " After death there is nothing " and the cultured philosophy of the later republic. These Roman tombstones forcibly bring home to us the change in the spiritual temper of mankind since the days when the Greeks of the fifth .and fourth centuries B.C. in their uncertain apprehension of things future, had been content to veil the mystery of death in pleasing semblances of life, and had adorned their stelae with scenes of family reunions or farewells. The ornament, likewise, is, more often than not, a carefully thought-out symbolism of after-life. The oft-recurring pine-cone has already been explained as a symbol of resurrection ; the lion, 1 Gruppe, s. v. Orpheus, in Roscher's Lex. col. 1200; see also A.

I9 the cock, the snake, already familiar decorations of Greek tombs, acquire on these Roman provincial stelae a fresh symbolical value under the influence of mithraism and similiar oriental religions. The frequency with which the lion appears, either simply or devouring an animal, is not sufficiently explained by calling the lion the protector of the tomb, or (in the case of the graves of soldiers) an emblem of valour.1 When in the solar cults the image became associated with the igneous element, 2 it was charged with a new mystic significance. On the roof of the " aedicula " from Maros- Nemeti (cat. pp. 66, 69)3 lions devouring the mystic bull, who is characterised by the sacrificial sash, 4flank and guard the pine-cone. On each of the uprights of the same " aedicula" 5 a snake gliding upwards is, I take it, figurative of the progress of the soul towards the celestial regions, even as in the solar cults the snake symbolises the sinuous course of the sun across the sky. 6 On the stele of Nertus from Buda- Pest (cat. p. 64 with illustr.) 7 the fighting cocks are something more than an emblem of combative and watchful instincts. As in Greek graves, the cock may here have an apotropaic function, 8 while, as herald of the sun, 9 he becomes by an easy transition the herald of re-birth and resurrection. The dolphins and marine monsters, another frequent decoration, form a mystic escort of the dead to the Isles of the Blest10 and at the same time doubtless signify the part assigned to the watery element in mithraic and solar cults.- The Medusa mask, perhaps the commonest ornament of the grave, whether alone or in conjunction with other symbols, has the apotropaic function of warding off evil spirits. A Medusa, probably from the door of a tomb, in the museum of Cilli (cat. p. 52), I The motive of the lion devouring an animal comes from Asia Minor (e.g. the lions in the archaic sepulchral chest from Xanthos, Brit. Mus. no. 8o); for its origin see H. Usener's epoch-making paper De carmine Iliadis quodam Phocaico, Bonn, 1875. Examples abound in Britain, e.g. Bruce, Lapid. Sept. p. 57, no. 103; p. 255 (from Carlisle); p. 391, nos. 759, 760 in Lowther Castle and the unfinished group in the Reading Museum found in 1905 at Silchester. These groups and single images of lions were doubtless also placed sometimes as sentinels to guard the entrances of temples. Sometimes the lion overpowers a man instead of an animal (Bruce,Lapid. p. 40). It is unfortunate that this class of monument is not more fully repre- sented in any section of the exhibition a good example is in section " Belgica " no. 17. Like the pine- cone the lion also played a part in connexion with fountains; for the lion in Greece as Kp?Wvo6XcaL, see A. B. Cook, loc. cit; for the mithraic usage of lions' heads as mouths of fountains see Cumont, Mithra, i, 102. 2 See Cumont, Mithra, i, 100, f; and the sat,ne writer on the lions in the pediment of an Augustan stele, Oesterr. Jahreshefte, xii, 1909, Beiblatt, p. 214. 3 Roof and " aedicula " do not belong together, but that does not affect the interpretation given above of the symbolism of each. 4The allusion to the Mithraic sacrifice is sug- gested by Cumont, Arch. Epigr. Mittheilungen aus Oesterreich-Ungarn, xvii, 1894, p. 24. He also explains the pine-cone in this "aedicula" as the symbol of immortality. 5 See also what Cumont says of these snakes of this " aedicula," loc. cit.

Further problems of the same nature are sug- gested by the interesting Pannonian relief from the vicinity of Gran, with representations of the Cabiri and of the " Thracian rider " (cat. p. 66). It is difficult to say whether another curious stele, found at Senitza in Central Bosnia and now in the museum of Serajevo, inadequately published at the time of its discovery,1 is christian or not. It shows four personages grouped in pairs, ranged stiffly side by side and each clothed in a long tunic, the folds of which are rendered by deep parallel grooves and adorned in three cases by a svastika (fig. 5). This relief and the mithraic com- munion mentioned above, belong to a section destined to represent the Roman sites and monuments of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is in process of formation (cat. p. 87, f.) The curious cippus found at Tatabanya (cat. p. 66), decorated on its four sides with three superposed reliefs each of which represents a divinity, offers a decided analogy to the richly carved "Juppiter and giant " columns so common on the Rhineland, 2 and opens out fresh vistas of the far-reaching influence of Ionian art (below, p. 24). The bronze statue of an athlete, found in I502 on the Helenenberg near Klagenfurt in Carinthia and now preserved in the Vienna museum (cat. p. 52), is copied from a Greek fifth-century statue of Polycleitan style, or, according to others, may even be an original work: in either case, it bears witness to the refined taste of Roman provincials. In the same room are electrotypes of the twenty-three gold vessels found at Nagy-Szent Miklos in Hungary, the so-called " Treasure of Attila," now in the imperial museum of Vienna (cat. p. 68).3 The inscription of one of the vessels evidently relates to christian baptism,4 but the date of the work and the origin of the art-forms are still under discussion. It is impossible to dwell in detail on the profusion of facsimiles of inscriptions, photographs, models, maps and plans of every kind which facilitate study here. Mention must however be made of a splendid map of the Roman provinces covered by the actual kingdom of Hungary. It is the work of Prof. G. Finaly and is published by the Hungarian Geographical Institute in Buda-Pest. It is only fair as we leave this splendid section to recall the names 1 WVissenschaftliche Mittheilungen aus Bosntien tnd der Ilerzeaovina, i, p. 278, pl. i, fig. 4.

GERMANIA (cat. pp. 75-86).' Had the sections Germania and Gallia reached the level of those which I have just noticed, we should have had a unique picture of Roman civilisation in central and western Europe. But, most unexpectedly, neither Germans nor French have done full jtustice to the Roman civilisation of their respective countries. The principal Germanic exhibits are: the famous cenotaph, from Bonn, of the optio M. Caelius who fell in the disastrous campaign of Varus (A.D. 9); the stele of the eques G. Romanius' and a charming " aedicula " in the shape of a house (see below), both from Mainz, and a rather meagre selection of details from the uniquely interesting monuments of Neumagen and of Trier. The museums of Mainz and Trier are the chief contributors ; those acquainted with other well-equipped museums of the Rhineland may ask why little or nothing has come from Cologne, from Wiesbaden, from Speyer, from Worms. The three heads from the museum of Trier, said to represent Celtic or Germanic types (cat. pp. 78, go), would gain much in interest if it were shewn by a drawing, or were stated in the catalogue, that they once adorned a balustrade round an orna- mental water in the Roman " villa " at Welschbillig, a curious arrangement which makes clear more than one Pompeian picture. 3 I may mention here a serious omission in the sections of Germania, Gallia and Britannia, that is the absence of plans and photographs of those numerous Roman villas which illustrate peculiarly the culture of these provinces. The Saalburg is illustrated by good photographs and a model. But we miss a plan to shew the line of the " Limes " and the sites of the many forts along its length. There is, however, a cast of the " Giant " column from Heddernheim (cat. p. 84, with ill.), and an excellent photograph by Professor Neeb of Mainz, of the superb Juppiter column at Mainz. 4 But in view of the importance of ' Organized by Professor Dragendorff and Professor Kehr. 2 The best and fullest discussion of the stelae of the Rhineland is still that of R.

The column was dedicated in A.D. 67 to the "genius of Nero," and is signed by the sculptors Samus and Severus.</page><page sequence="35">ROMAN EMPIRE, AT THE BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN, ROME. 23 this class of monuments, for both mythology and art, we regret that more of them were not represented. These "Juppiter and giant " columns with their heavily decorated bases and shafts have been compared to the Trajan and Aurelian columns in Rome, and justly so, since the Roman and Germanl columns alike go back to Ionian models, such as the carved columns of both the archaic and the later temple of Ephesos. We here have survivals of the old Ionian love of decoration; in my judgment, nothing shews better than these Rhineland columns the correctness of the view that the Rhineland was a centre of Ionian influence, which had gradually come up through the valley of the Rhone from the Greek colonies of southern Gaul. 2 When the Romans came into contact with this older civilisation, they adopted its forms, and forced them into the service of their ideas and subjects. One word may here be said about the much disputed meaning of the group which crowns the Giant columns. Till lately, the rider was generally accepted as a Romanised version of the Celtic sun- and thunder-god, Taranis 3; more recently, German archaeologists have inclined to interpret him as the German thunder-god Wodan4; others again will have it that he is a Roman emperor, or an allegory of the Imperium Romanum or of the Numen Augusti, riding down a conquered foe. The latest writer on the subject, Dr. Hertlein, interprets the columns as " Irminsaulen," symbols of the universe; they are, he thinks, columns such as, according to Teutonic mythology, supported the heavens, here typified by Juppiter as lord of the skies. 5 But is it necessary to scour Celtic and Teutonic mythology for an explanation ? Is not the rider simply a Romanised sun-god, brought west like many solar divinities, and like the planetary system which is represented on the base of our column-the same Xlo ' twrwroc that is seen at full gallop on the coins of Arycanda. 6 The sun-god coursing over the earth (appropriately symbolised by a giant) seems the necessary crowning of a monument which em- bodies, as Hertlein has shewn, a whole allegory of times and 1 This type of column, however, is not re- stricted to Germany. 'Ihere are examples in France (see a paper by Hertlein cited in note 6). In Britain, a curious inscribed base from one of these columns is in the Bathurst Museum at Ciren- cester, " with a socket at the top for a column and another socket beneath for insertion into another stone or base," see Prof. Haverfield's paper in Archaeologia Oxoniensis (1895), p. 2I5 with illustr. I have little doubt that a large capital with busts of the four seasons, found at Corinium and now in Col. Dugdale's garden (" The Abbey "), be- longed likewise to a "Juppiter and Giant" column. 2 The view was first put forward by Loeschke, Berliner Philologische JVochenschrift, 1893, p. 220; cf. S. Reinach, Chroniques d'Orient, vi, 279; Mommsen's Roman Provinces, i (Engl. trans. ed. 1909), I I4, ff; Michaclis, A Century of Archaeo- logical Discoveries (tr.

On each of the four sides of the plinth (" four-god stones ") appears the image of a divinity representing a season. Upon this plinth stands a smaller heptagonal base with the image of one of the planetary week-days carved on each face (Wochengottersteine); from this again springs the shaft terminating with a capital adorned with four faces which according to Hertlein are the four divisions of the day; Nox and Meridies, Matutinus and Vesper. As yet, the last word has not been said on either the mythology or the art-forms of these singular monuments. I may suggest here that the great bronze " Bernward Saule " at Hildesheim may more probably be derived from the German " Juppiter and giant " columns than from the columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius at Rome.1 The celebrated " Igel Saule " (plate v), the grand family- tomb put up in the third century A.D. by the Secundinii, wealthy cloth merchants, in the country of the Treveri, is from its size and decoration one of the most important monuments of Roman Germania (plates VI and VII). As far back as I792 it excited the admiration of Goethe, who saw it as he travelled from Trier to Luxemburg to join the allied armies2; he not only admired the column, but expressed a hope that it might be drawn and measured. More than a century has elapsed and Goethe's countrymen have not as yet quite adequately fulfilled his wish, and though I understand that the monument will shortly be published by the German Archaeological Institute, at present the best illustrations remain those of Laborde in the Monuments de France. 3 Lately, however, the column has been cast in its entirety, and seeing that it illumines all Roman art in the western provinces, one might have confidently expected a cast to form a centre of the German section. Actually, it is represented only by a photograph of the front and by casts of two details, the Mars and Rhea Silvia scene of the west pediment and the supper scene of the principal facade. Both iconography and art throw a vivid light on the civilisation of this land of the Treveri with its mixed Ionian, Roman and Celtic elements. The pleasant scenes of family life and business enter- prise on the friezes and podium reflect the spirit of Greck sepulchral decoration; the principal facade brings before us the picture of a Gallo-Roman family; the rest is given up to the religious symbolism of the time,4 of which it offers the splendid and convincing epitome. 1 As even Strzygowski assumes, Dom zu Aachen, pp. zz, f. 2 Campaign in France, transl.

Graeven, Zeitschrilt fu'r bildende Kunst, neue Folge, vol. xvi, 1905, pp. 165-170, but with little reference to their symbolism.</page><page sequence="37">ROMAN EMPIRE, AT THE BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN, ROME. 25 The inscription declares the tomb to have been erected, in the first instance, for the wife of one of the Secundinii and the two children of the other. The survivors are portrayed on the principal panel of the front facel ; above them are three medallions with busts of the deceased. In the pediment, the rape of Hylas by the water (or wood) nymphs, creatures of mystery and terror like the noon-dav Pan,2 symbolises the rape of the soul through the dread powers of death. On the east face, the scene where Thetis dips Achilles into the waters of Styx to make him immortal is emblematic of purificatory baptismal rites,3 while in the pediment Luna, the inseparable companion of Sol Sanctissimus, drives her chariot. These scenes are balanced on the large panel of the west face by (a) the liberation by Perseus of Andromeda, symbolic of the release of the soul from its earthly chains through divine inter- vention, (b) the scene where Perseus shows to Andromeda Medusa's head reflected in the water, an allusion to the apotropaic power of the Gorgoneion to ward off evil spirits from the tomb, and in the west pediment by the story of Mars and Rhea Silvia, which carried, as we have seen, the promise of reawakening after the sleep of death. On. the rear wall of the tomb is a superb representation, rare at this period, of the apotheosis of Hercules, who mounts heavenward in his chariot within the circle of the zodiac.4 Minerva no longer rides by the hero's side, as in earlier Greek representations of the scene ; she emerges from the clouds to meet him and extends her hand to help his ascension, a motive that recalls the hand of the biblical God stretched out to the christian emperor on later Roman medallions of consecration.5 In each of the four spandrels appears the head of a wind-god emblematic of the four cardinal points that divide the sky. 6 The allusion in the images of this panel is evidently to the triumphant progress of the soul after it has, like Hercules, accomplished its cycle of earthly labours. In the frieze above, a genius bridles two griffins, the winged monsters sacred to Apollo and other solar gods,' a subject peculiarly appropriate here, below the pediment, where the " Giver of life," Sol Sanctissimus himself, appears in his quadriga. The crown of the monument is a capital adorned with four heads framed by the intertwining coils of four snake-footed figures. On the analogy of a fragment at Trier, 8 J take it that these heads represent the seasons, the 1 Dr. Graeven believes that the male figure on the left is not one of the Secundinii, but Hermes, and derives the composition from the famous "Orpheus, Eurydice and Hermes " relief. 2 Propertius, I, xx, zz, ah dolor ! ibat Hylas, ibat hamadryasin. But Baehrens and Postgate read Enhydriasin. 3 The subject is not uncommon on sepulchral stelae anid other montuments of the period (cf. Haverfield, Romanisation of Britain, p. 17, note i.) The corresponding scene, with Hercules rescuing Hesione, is susceptible of the same interpretation. 4 For the zodiac, see inter alia, the beautiful relief with the mithraic Kronos at Modena, pub- lished by Cumont, Revue Archeol. xl, 1899, p. 9. 5 Cumont, Rev.

This capital supports four half-figures that hold up the terrestrial sphere, and in these figures I incline to recognise the same divisions of the day and night that appear on the capitals of the "giant" columns. Finally, above the earth and the material universe, the eagle soars upward to the stars bearing with him Ganymede, symbol of the liberated soul. 1 The picturesque scenes from daily life that enliven the rest of the surface need no comment here; the meaning of the dolphins and other creatures of the deep, on the upper and lower friezes of the podium, is clear from what I have already said of other similar representations. Thus, the imagery is taken from the same cycle as that of the sepulchral stelae. But it is treated with greater freedom and mastery of expression. The beauty of the designs comes, indeed, as a surprise to those who think of Roman provincial art as decadent or worse. The exquisite putti, for instance, that adorn the uprights on all four sides would not be unworthy of a master of the Tuscan Quattrocento. I am aware that in stating this I am running counter to a general opinion. So great an authority as M. Camille Jullian2 has condemned in no uncertain phrases the whole art of the Igel Monument. The explanation attempted above of the iconography of the tomb may, I trust, dispel the charge of ignorant vulgarity brought against the Secundinii by M. Jullian. They may have shown themselves a little over-emphatic and over-elaborate, a little too anxious to surpass their neighbours alike in the expression of their piety and in the record of their commerce. But the eagle, which to M. Jullian (who overlooks the Ganymede) represents only the vulgar ambition of a " negociant proprietaire " to appropriate to himself " the emblem of military force and of armed victory," shows at least that the Secundinii believed in a world beyond where they too might be liberated from their earthly cares. The tomb now stands in single grandeur amidst the charming village of Igel, beside the line of the Roman road from Trier to Rheims. In antiquity it was one of many similar monuments, which may still be studied in the fine drawings and reconstructions attempted in the museum of Trier. Their tower-like structures with pyramidal roofs may be traced back to the tomb of St. Remy in Provence and from this to the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and the Lycian tombs of MVierehi and Payava in the British Museum, while the profuse carving of every available surface recalls the superposed frieze of the podium of the Mausoleum, those of the monument of the Nereids, the walls of the Heroon at Gjolbashi 1 For the rape of Ganymede, as image of the ascension of the soul, see Cumont, Rev. Hist. Rel. Ixii, 1910, p. 140,f. and the examples cited by him, ibid. note 2; the Igel column, however, is not mentioned. 2 Camille Jullian, Gallia, p. 204.</page><page sequence="39">ROMAN EMPIRE, AT THE BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN, ROME. 27 and the richly decorated podium and roof of the Lycian tombs mentioned above. The delightful friezes from Neumagen (Trier Museum), with the " school-room " and the " rent-day" scenes, belonged to the narrow sides of similar monuments (cat. pp. 79, 83). So too the relief from St. Wendel on which two young Gallo-Romans test a piece of cloth (cat. p. 8i). On the other hand, the reliefs of a boat laden with casks of Mosel wine and manned by six lusty oars- men, probably adorned, with its companion relief, the top of a somewhat different oblong tomb with projecting wings (cat. p. 82). 1 The rear wall of these mausolea is frequently adorned by gay patterns of rosettes, no specimens of which have been sent to this section. In a vitrine of this section may be seen facsimiles of military relics: examples of the Roman foot-gear found in profusion at Saalburg; the sword of Tiberius from Mainz, now in the British Museum; copies of the phalerae or military medals found in i858 at Lauersfort and now in the museum of Berlin, which are said to have been worn as a protection from evil or magic. One of the medallions is inscribed MEDAMVS, the same name, presumably of the maker, which appears on the foot of the silver cup from Alesia in the museum of Saint-Germain. In this room also are arranged casts of such slabs of the Aurelian column as illustrate types of Germans. Finally, it must not be forgotten that a familiar monument of Germania, the bronze " she-wolf," now in the vestibule of the cathedral of Aachen, is placed in room ii. Though a mere Hellenistic bear masquerading as a Roman wolf,2 the beautiful alert beast is evidently still accepted as symbol of alliance between the empire of Charlemagne and the eternal city beyond the Alps. Opposite stands, owing to a supposed like connexion with Rome, 3 the wolf's companion at Aachen, the great bronze pine-cone sup- ported by the four rivers of Paradise, that once served as fountain. It is an eleventh-century relic, originally imitated, according to Strzygowvski, from the pine-cone fountains in the atrium of Syrian churches. GALLIAE TRES (cat. p. 87-94) 4. The interest of the section " Galliae Tres " is learned and antiquarian rather than artistic (fig. 6). The student of epigraphy may be interested to see reproductions of such famous inscriptions as I See the reconstruction, Hettner, Fuhrer, p. 13. 2 Strzygowski, Dom zu Aachen, pp. 2, f. 3 The notion that it was imitated from the Vatican "pigna" has been disposed of by Strzy- gowski, op. cit. pp. I6, f. 4 Organized by M.

In the first place, where the object was to obtain as faithful an image as might be of Rome's relation to her provinces, it was imperative to secure an adequate repre- sentation, if not of all Gaul, at least of Rome's favourite province, that " Other Italy" which from the moment of conquest was beloved by Caesar to the point of arousing both the irony of Cicero and the more serious jealousy of the Roman senators, which was always foremost in the thoughts of Augustus and his immediate successors, and which was a special care to the Flavians and Antonines. Yet the title of the section, Tres Galliae, would almost seem to exclude this province of Narbonensis from the exhibition programme.2 The omission, if it was intended, has been made good in great measure by the liberal administration of the Musee de Saint-Germain, who lend admirable cork models of the theatre and circus of Arausio (Orange), of the amphitheatres of Nemausus (Nimes) and Arelate (Arles); of the Augustan temple (Maison Carree) at Nemausus, and of the great aqueduct over the Gardon. But besides these models practically nothing illustrates the art and life of that which was the Provincia par excellence. There are neither models nor photographs of the other Maison Carree, the temple of Augustus and Roma at Vienne; of the interesting bridge and bridge-portals at Saint- Chamas; of the fine arches of Cavaillon and Carpentras or of the massive gates of Narbonne. There is nothing to illustrate Frejus, Avignon, Vaison and the numerous other Roman cities of this region. We miss especially reliefs of the arch of Orange and of the arch and monument of the Julii at St. Remy, though casts of these exist and may be seen at Saint Germain. The Tres Galliae themselves come off little better. From Saint- Germain again come three models of balistae and an onager, for shooting stones, which were constructed for Napoleon III. Better models, embodying more recent research, may now be seen at the Saalburg;4 these Saint-Germain examples remain as a pathetic record of the ill-starred emperor's ambitions to be the historian of Caesar. According to an anecdote told by Gregorovius, 5 Napoleon wrote frequently and minutely to the Roman archaeologist Pietro Rosa on behalf of his history, and Rosa wondered " how a monarch on whose shoulders rested so heavy a political burthen could find 1 C.1.L. xii, i i8. 2 The formulas of the old world fit in ill with those of to-day. In antiquity " Tres Galliae " were the three provinces of Lugudunensis, Aquitania and Belgica. In the Mostra, the section thus denominated includes Narbonensis, Lugudunensis and Aquitania, with contributions from Belgica and Germany, wvhile most of Belgica is treated either under Germany or in a section (no. I8) which really reprcsents rather the modern kingdom of Belgium. 3 These models were made about 1850 by one Pelet, who also wrote a book (now valuable and rare) to explain them. 4See Rudolf Schneider, Die antikeez Geschiitze der Saalhurg. a Roman Journals, transl. Hamilton, p. T56.</page><page sequence="42">30 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE time for work of this kind. He wrote and questioned as if he were a professor who did nothing else than pore over books." We are again reminded of Napoleon's enthusiasm for Caesar by the little collection in this section which illustrates the excavations at Alesia, which he began in i86z and which others have recently continued with signal success. M. Matruchot, who is responsible for the objects from Alesia, must be congratulated on the representative character which he has imparted to the collection in this modest vitrine; rather than leave gaps, he has wisely condescended to illustrated post-cards. Another case displays a number of works, mostly Roman copies of Greek originals, which show the elegant taste of the richer Gauls; among them we note the "Juppiter d'Evreux," a masterpiece too little known ; a Volneratus deficiens from Bavai, which almost certainly reproduces the famous statue of Cresilas, and is sufficiently beautiful and well preserved to have aroused serious (though, I believe, unfounded) doubts as to its genuineness; the head of the Knidian Aphrodite from Toulouse; a bronze portrait- head of Pacatianus; the Juno of Lyons, and so on. But it is hard, in this class of work, to pronounce between importation from Rome and genuine provincial imitation of Graeco-Roman models. The Louvre has sent a number of casts of Roman copies of Greek originals. But these are not Gaulish. The " Pallas de Velletri," which was procured for the Louvre in i8oi (according to Fr6hner, Sculpture antique d?&gt; Louvre, no. I 4) has obviously nothing to do with ancient Gaul. Nor again the " Venus de Frejus," which has been recently shown by M. S. Reinach to have been brought from Naples in the time of Francis I. 1 Everyone must regret that the real art of Gaul, the Gallo-Roman sculpture, which is becoming familiar from the Receuil of M. Esperandieu, 2 is not represented. A selection of casts such as those which adorn the Musee de Saint- Germain would have made vivid the civilisation of Gaul and have formed a proper clou to the section " Gallia." Is it too late to urge the French provincial museums to send to Rome a selection of those stelae, illustrative of the crafts and trades of ancient Gaul, of which the museum of Bordeaux, among others, offers character- istic examples (Esperandieu, ii, p. I55, ff. nos. I I I i, i i i6, etc.) ? So far, not one of these or similar pieces is shown here nor has anything been sent to illustrate larger monuments. Photographs at any rate might be exhibited of such famous buildings as the arch of Germanicus at Saintes; the Porte de Diane at Cahors; the gates of Autun, of Langres, of Rheims; the Tour de Vesone at Perigueux; the thermae and amphitheatre of Paris. Nor has any attempt been made to picture the industrial condition which reflected the material 1 Revue Arcbeologique, 1905, i, 400, f. 2 Esp6randieu, Recueil General des Bas-Reliefs de la Gaule Romaine. rhree vols. have appeared (Paris 1907-1910) ; the work is to be complete in SiX.</page><page sequence="43">ROMAN EMPIRE, AT THE BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN, ROME. 3I prosperity of the rich and splendid province. It is disappointing, for instance, to find no examples of that Gallic terra sigillata (which began by imitating Arretine and similar wares and then grew so important that its influence radiated from Gaul to the confines of the empire, when, as Dechelette puts it, " Italy, enervated by habits of indolence, abandoned to its northern provinces the monopoly of industrial production." 1 The weakness of the section Gallia is the more surprising in that the French have done such wonders in other sections. The plan of Rome by Chedanne, the model of Rome by Bigot, the model of Spalato by Hebrard, have already been alluded to. We shall presently see how richly equipped, thanks to French architects, is the section Africa.2 BELGICA AND HELVETIA (cat. pp. 159, I63). Although these regions were in antiquity parts of Gallia and Germania, they are banished to the opposite end of the museum owing to exigencies of space; we may here glance briefly at their contents. The area now covered by modern Belgium is represented by a selection of casts, models and photographs sent by the Belgian "Musees Royaux des Arts decoratifs et industriels," accompanied by the Baron de Loe's excellent little catalogue. Among these is a cast of the interesting milestone from Tongres ; the school-scene from the provincial museum of Arlon ; and the curious relief of a boat with merchandise and oarsmen, from Vieux-Virton. In the central vitrine is a selection of casts of small Gallo-Roman statuary in marble and bronze (a bronze Venus from Elouges; a Mercury from Tirlemont, imitated from a Greek original; a Hercules from Koninxheim; a seated Mercury of the Collection Raoul Warocque from Nimy, and several Gallo-Roman bronzes, etc.). In a second vitrine on the right attention should be paid to the model of one of the tumuli near Tirlemont, which with their underground wood-lined chambers and Roman sepulchral furniture are characteristic of Belgica and apparently served as sepulchres to the Belgo-Romans (cat. p. i6i). These and other interesting tumuli and grave-chambers of Belgium may be conveniently studied from plans and photographs placed against the right wall. The instructive model of the villa of l'Hoste at Basse-Wavre in Brabant makes us regret once more the absence of any models of Roman villas in other sections. Helvetia, 4 too, was never a separate province, but a part of Germania Superior. Yet modern Switzerland sends an excellent and representative collection of objects found on its Roman sites.

The Roman culture of the ancient Batavi and Frisii (cat. p. I63) who inhabited what is modern Holland, is illustrated by objects from the Leyden museum, arranged on the stairs leading into the hall of the Ara pacis. Of peculiar interest is the cast of a charming votive altar to Nehalennia, found like the other votive offerings to this divinity of seafarers, in January I647 at the harbour of Domburg in Zeeland. 1 The art-type, which seems derived from that of the seated Cybele, is interesting to compare with that of the Matronae and the Matres, though I am far from suggesting any mythological connexion between the two. BRITANNIA (cat. p. I53) 2 The section opposite Helvetia and next to Belgica has been allotted to Britannia, whose Roman civilisation is inseparable from that of the other north-western provinces of the empire. Un- fortunately this section is ill-equipped; the sections Germania and Gallia, which I have ventured to criticise above, appear rich by comparison. The failure is the more regrettable in that Britannia is little known, not only to foreigners but to the modern British themselves. How many, even among scholars, apart from professed archaeologists, go to Colchester (Camulodunum), to Cirencester (Corinium), to Chester (Deva), to Chesters on the North Wall, to Newcastle (Pons Aelii), to York (Eburacum) ? How many know that most of these contain valuable collections of British- Roman antiquities found on or near the spot ? And though the excavations carried on with much success of late years by Prof. Haverfield and his colleagues at Corbridge (Corstopitum) and by Dr. Ashby and others at Caerwent (Venta Silurum) have, as formerly those of Silchester, attracted considerable attention, yet the unfair and one-sided estimate of the Roman civilisation of Britain, printed as recently as I908 by so great an authority as the late Adolf Michaelis, shows how meagre is the recognition as yet accorded to Romano- British research. 3 So unimportant, according to the illustrious I See Ihm in Roscher s.v.

Yet in this year's presidential address to the Society of Antiquaries, Dr. C. H. Read assured us that " the soil of England is rich beyond belief in relics of past times ! " Roman Britain may be poor in artistic objects, strictly so called. But it abounds in objects of high archaeological interest. It would be difficult, however, from the scanty examples sent to Rome, to divine the real archaeological wealth of Britannia. Yet the authorities at home should not have let slip the opportunity of bringing together for the first time a representative collection of casts, models and photographs of Romano-British monuments, if only to show the benefits which might accrue from the erection in England of a central Romano-British museum on the lines of the Gallo-Roman section in the Saint-Germain museum, or of the more recent " R6misch-Germanisches Museum " in Mainz. It would be a place where the researches of trained scholars and excavators, as well as the efforts of local antiquaries, might find a natural centre and where, by the side of originals, casts rnight be seen of the more significant examples in other English museums, together with foreign specimens that throw light on English dis- coveries. The lack of such a museum is at the bottom of the failure of the section Britannia in Rome. There seems to have been no responsible body to appeal to, and the British, reputed the richest nation of Europe, find themselves surpassed in the exhibition not only by other rich nations like France, Germany, Austria and Hungary, but by Spain, Belgium and Switzerland, by Greece and Roumania. The failure of the section Britannia is after all only the sequel to the neglect from which Roman archaeology, Roman monuments and Roman studies generally, have suffered in England. In the British Museum, for instance, the larger part of the Romano-British objects were dislodged some I4 years ago in favour of the Rothschild collection. In other words, four hundred years of our island's history were suppressed from that department of our national museum whose function it is to present an unbroken archaeological record of Great Britain. The Greek and Roman department offered to a dozen of these neglected monuments the hospitality of a dark wall in the corridor of Roman busts; but a very great number are still, we believe, consigned to oblivion in dirty and inaccessible basements. It is fair to add that changes are in progress which may restore them to the light of day some two or three years* hence. But the whole procedure of the trustees of the museum is noteworthy. In another part of London the fine collection at the Guildhall is badly lit and over- crowded, and similar criticisms are deserved by numerous local</page><page sequence="46">34 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE museums throughout the country, witness, for instance, the too well named Blackgate Museum at Newcastle. It is a national disgrace, moreover, that Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) so ably and completely excavated by the Society of Antiquaries of London, should have been wholly and entirely covered up again and every part of its site restored to cultivation. In spite of our professed interest in the history of our Church and its archi- tecture, not so much as a cross, or a post, or a heap of stones marks the spot, just south of the forum, where the earliest known christian church on British soil now lies buried. One gets the impression that the excavators cannot have felt so sure as they declared themselves to be, that this church was a church. Under these circumstances can we wonder at Michaelis' unfavourable judgment, or that the British government, so slow to encourage archaeological effort at home, should have utterly failed to grasp the jmportance of the opportunity, offered by the Roman exhibition, of showing that the monuments of Britannia are worthy to rank with those of her sister provinces ? Was it too much to expect to see in our section a cast of the imperial bronze statue from Barking Hall, with its inlaid decorations, or of the grand helmet from Ribchester, both in the British Museum ? But in a later part of this Journal, Mr. Haverfield and Mr. Stuart-Jones will show at greater length what casts might have been sent under more favourable conditions and their value for the study of Roman art. Recent important works like Mr. James Curle's " A Roman Frontier Post and its People " or Mr. G. Macdonald's " The Roman Wall in Scotland " and the articles that continually appear in English publications on the subject of Roman Britain show, like the ex- cavations referred to, that British scholars are well alive to the importance of the Roman remains in their country. Moreover the success of the British pavilion in the Valle Giulia and of the less ambitious but no less interesting exhibition in the foreign pavilion at the Castello S. Angelo of objects connected with illustrious Englishmen in Italy, sufficiently prove that Great Britain can play a distinguished role in foreign exhibitions, when there is a central organising body at home to control operations. There seems little doubt that if the new Society of Roman Studies, of which this Journal is the organ, had been in full working order at the time that the exhibition was first being organised, we should not now be re- gretting the inadequacy of our Romano-British section. As it is, the monuments of Britannia are represened by a few inscriptions, a few enlarged photographs of the wall of Hadrian, a cork model of the Roman baths of Aquae Sulis (Bath), some drawings and plans of Caerwent, Corbridge and Silchester, and a set of large scale ordnance maps of the Wall, presented by the Government and arranged by Prof. Hayerfield. The section is somewhat better off</page><page sequence="47">ROMAN EMPIRE, AT THE BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN, ROME. 35 for examples of casts of sculptures. If the casts are few, they are well chosen. They include the well-preserved stele of the centurion M. Favonius Facilis from Colchester ; the Deae matres from Cirencester; the splendid bearded Gorgon from Bath (above, p. 20), repeatedly brought into deserved prominence by Prof. Haverfield1; the fountain group of a lion devouring a stag,2 an altar of Juppiter Dolichenus, and the fragment with an imperial Apotheosis 3, these three last from the excavations at Corbridge. The strange effigies of British divinities found at Caerwent also deserve notice. 4 This exhibition brings home to us the fallacy of picturing the *western provinces of the empire in sharp contrast to the eastern, as a tabula rasa upon which the Romans inscribed feeble and unintelligent imitations of the art-forms they had themselves borrowed from Greece and the Orient. History has done little or nothing to preserve the record of pre-Roman civilisations in the West. But archaeology daily reveals fresh traces of the varied artistic influences which in different regions combined with and modified the types imported by the Romans. In Britannia, Gallia and the adjacent regions we have to reckon with strong Celtic elements ; in southern Gallia and in the districts of the Mosel and the Rhine with Greek survivals; while in parts of Germania, in the strip between the Rhine and the " Limes," definite traces may yet be found of Teutonic influences, at present only surmised. HIsPANIA (cat. p. 95). The section " Hispaniae Tres " contains the surprise of the exhibition. The Espagne Primitive of M. Pierre Paris and his charming Promenades 4rche'ologiques a travers l'Espagne had already drawn attention to the archaeological wealth of Spain. But till this exhibition none, save the few who had dipped into the pages of the admirable publications of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans, guessed its variety and extent. The section reflects the utmost credit on the energy, devotion and learning of a young Spanish scholar, Sefior Jose Pijoan, to whose enthusiasm and reso- lution it is due. The whole history of ancient Iberia, as told in its monuments, may be read here, from prehistoric days till the later I F.

Evans and others. 4 It must not be forgotten that a notable British exhibit, the electrotype of the Corbridge lanx, is exhibited in another section with other gold and silver wvork.</page><page sequence="48">36 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE empire. In giving examples of the prehistoric and Iberian periods, Sefior Pijoan has, it is true, transgressed the limits of his section, but he will be readily forgiven for the sake of the vision which he has evoked of the successive stages of culture in ancient Iberia. Here are casts of the famous bronze heads of bulls found at Costig in FIG. 7. SPANISH PRIESTESS (p. 37). Majorca, which from their resemblance to similar Cretan objects suggest that Spain, at least on its east coast, came in touch with the Minoan civilisation. 1 The " Vicha de Bazalote," known to 1 P.

The Graeco-lberian period is well represented by a selection of figures from the find at the Cerro de los Santos (Madrid museum) among them the stately priestess holding a vase in front of her (fig. 7), a work second only to the majestic " Dama di Elche," that flower of Iberic art which, alas for Spain, found its way to the Louvre, from the home of its discoverer at Elche, in the manner so wittily told by M. Paris.1 The monuments from the Roman period abundantly illustrate the high civilisation and the artistic culture of a province which was the birthplace of Trajan and Hadrian, Lucan and Martial, Seneca and Quintilian. The beautiful sar- cophagus of Hersillus with the " Tragedy of Orestes " is purely Hellenistic and was probably brought from Italyor Greece. Distinc- tively Roman are the beautiful stele of Juventia Urbica from Merida, now in the museum of Seville (plate viii); a portrait of a ladv (plate ix) which, if one may judge by the coiffure, is of republican or early Augustan date, though the rendering of the hair by striated lines recalls Iberian workmanship; a remarkable male portrait of the Flavian period (plate x), which closely resembles the portrait of the shoemaker Helius on the well-known stele in the Palazzo dei Conservatori at Rome ;2 and lastly, the still unpublished stele of a miner with his lantern and tools from Bafnos (Madrid museum). The Spanish section is very much up to date. Here are already casts of the three over-life-size statues found this spring in the excavations of the theatre at Merida, a goddess with diadem and veil, and two togate figures, now headless, of the ordinary type. One of these, if we may trust the inscription Agri[ppa] roughly scratched on the base in late lettering, might be the portrait statue of the donor of the theatre. 3 On the right thigh of the other figure we read the words ex officinis Caii 4uli, which may suggest that these statues were sometimes made wholesale after one pattern in the stone- cutter's yard. Spain, in spite of the long and heroic struggles that preceded her surrender, became in time more Roman than the Romans. What Mommsen wrote of the votive stones of Baetica is true, if in a lesser degree, of the monuments of the other Spanish provinces. There are few " which might not quite as well have been set up in Italy." The Spanish section, like the Gaulish, is rich in inscriptions. Once more the name of Aemilius Paullus meets us in the celebrated decree in archaic Latin which orders the emancipation of the slaves of the people of Hasta who dwelt at Turris Lascutana; it is inscribed I Promenades, p. 8 i, ff. 2 Strong, Roman Sculpture, pl. cxii. This, at any rate, was the opinion of the excavators. But the inscription, besides being late, is very faint, and the catalogue (p. ioz) does not even refer to it, but merely states that the statue is " perhaps that of Agrippa wlho constructed the theatre " of Merida.</page><page sequence="50">38 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE on a bronze tablet from Lascuta, now in the Louvre, 1 Aemilius was in Spain as praetor in I9I B.C. and the decree is dated in castreis, a.d. xii k. Febr. Splendid bridges, too, and aqueducts, like those of Segovia and Alcantara and the Puente del Diablo in Tarragona, which have long been the admiration of travellers, can be conveniently studied in the exhibition, by the aid of a collection of large photographs representing Hispania from the Iberian Greek to the late Roman age. Here are views of the walls and other buildings of the recently excavated Greek colony of Emporion (Ampurias) 2 of the walls and monuments of Tarraco (Tarragona). and of Saguntum ; of the latest excavations at Augusta Emerita and so forth. The republican period is mainly represented by plans and photographs of Numantia, so effectively destroyed in 133 B.C. by Scipio, " Africanus et Numantinus," that till a few years ago its site was disputed. Now, thanks to Professor Adolf Schulten's memorable excavations in I905-I909, which disclosed the lines and trenches of Scipio and much else besides, it is a monument nacional," and the Spaniards themselves are exca- vating the Iberian city. To the classical archaeologist Spain is still almost virgin soil, in spite of the excavations and explorations initiated by French and German savants. 3 But it is by the Spaniards. themselves that the rich harvest must be reaped. They have at last realised the treasures of antique art and culture which their land holds hidden, and they have turned to archaeological research with an energy that should soon make up for lost time. This awakening of archaeological enterprise coincided with a similar revival in the study of history which found expression in the recently instituted Centro de Estudios Historicos of Madrid. It is largely, I believe, at the instigation of the Centro, that the Spanish Govern- ment were prevailed upon to found only this year an " Escuela de Espafia " in Rome with Sefior Pijoan as director of archaeological studies. The Spanish section at the Mostra archeologica of I9II is the best omen of the success certain to attend such well-directed efforts. With a sagacity and wisdom that contrasts favourably with the chauvinism which checks archaeological enterprise in too many Mediterranean lands, the Spaniards not only recognise that they need fellow-workers in their vast enterprise, but they also welcome them, a fact to be borne in mind by those who complain of lack of opportunity for excavation or research in the western basin of the Mediterranean. The prospect that offers at last of an accurate archaelogical map of Spain is very welcome. The large map that hangs on the left of the entrance to this section is not only completed in manuscript, but is to be published shortly.

NUMII)IA, MAURETANIA (cat. p. I42). 1 From Hispania one crosses naturally to North Africa, whose rich Roman remains are here represented by superb photographs and models of sites and monuments and statues. Those of various parts of Timgad, by M. Albert Ballu, of the theatre and capitol of Dougga (plate xi), and of various North African villas shew how faithfully the life of Rome and Italy was mirrored in that of Africa. They bring vividly before us the cities erected by Rome in the image of herself, "centres of an intense life destined in time to draw to Rome, through material prosperity as miuch as through the prestige of her name, those sons of the desert whose only wish henceforth was to bear Latin names, to don the toga, to institute a government modelled on the Italian municipalities, to adorn their cities with Roman monuments." 2 Here also is a facsimile of the celebrated mosaic of Virgil between two muses, holding a scroll on which is inscribed Aen. i. 8 (museum of Sousa). The public and even scholars are still so much in the dark as regards the true portraiture of Virgil that it is to be hoped the authorities at Trier may see their way to send to the Mostra a facsimile of the medallion of Virgil from the mosaic of Monnus in their museum,3 for comparison with the Sousa mosaic. We could also wish that more facsimiles could be exhibited of the countless mosaics revealed by the African excavations. The whole history of Roman-African mosaic might be illustrated from the examples collected in the museum of the Bardo at Tunis. ASIA (cat. p. 153). Opposite Africa stand the various divisions of Asia. For Per- gamon we have drawings by P. Salzmann, executed in preparation for the sixth volume of the Alterthiimer von Pergamon and showing the Roman forum, basilica, amphitheatre and thermae. Large photographs are exhibited of the reliefs in honour of Marcus Aurelius, found by the Austrians in their recent excavations of Roman Ephesus and now in Vienna.4 A cast of the grandest of these has been presented to the exhibition by His Majesty the Emperor of Austria and is here reproduced (plate xii) from a photo- graph taken by kind permission of the exhibition authorities. The slab shows the victorious emperor anticipating the honour of apotheosis while still in life, 5 and mounting the sun's own chariot, 1 Organised by M. Merlin for the monuments of Tunisia, and by M. Ballu for those of Algeria. 2 R. Cagnat, Carthage, Timgad, Tebessa, p. 157. 3 Hettner, Fiihrer, p. 64, f. Unfortunately none of the important mosaics from Trier of the neigh- bourhood are represented in the exhibition. 4 The reliefs may perhaps be referred to the Parthian victory of A.D. I65. They were fopnd in front of the library of Tiberius Julius Celsus. where at a later date they had been adapted as decoration of a fountain. 3 See Cumont in Rev. Hist. Rel. 191 1, p. 37, f.</page><page sequence="52">40 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE while Sol himself, manifest by his crown of rays, precedes the chariot by the side of Virtus. In the space between the emperor and the horses, flutters Victory, and the chariot soars upwards over the earth, which is symbolized by a recumbent figure of Terra Mater, her horn of plenty in her left arm, a child with fruit on her right side. This composition and its counterpart, Selene mounting her chariot attended by the Evening Star, are purely Hellenistic; they are examples of the brilliant art which had passed from Asia Minor to Rome into the service of Roman subjects. They have, as has been justly pointed out, much in common with the reliefs of the altar of Pergamum. We feel everywhere in Asia Minor, whether we study its art or its history, that the dominant civilisation remained Greek, and, as happens often when a new civilisation comes into contact with an older one, the Romans surrendered to its spell. But art in Greece and Greek lands had ceased to have any motive power ; it had long been stationary, showing itself capable, at best, as in these Ephesos reliefs, of masterly imitation of older models. The remaining slabs show the same Hellenistic influence, though the imperial group of Marcus Aurelius and his colleague with the boy Commodus between themr and a personage in attendance on either side, forms a striking exception to the rest. Here technique and modelling, the delicate touch and the suave lines, are Greek. But the stern frontal pose of the personages shows the same Roman manner of grouping and portraiture which we know in the tomb- stones of Rome and of the western provinces. It is regrettable that the display of art from the Asiatic provinces is so mneagre. The sepulchral reliefs of the Roman soldiers in Asia and Syria and the Palmyrene stelae would show that, with the decay of Greek artistic ideals, the primitive frontal sculpture was coming to the fore alike in East and West. The German excavations of Baalbeck are represented by fine photographs of the principal monuments, and there are good views of Palmyra. But there are no casts, plans, models or maps, a curious omission this, seeing the beauty of the Syrian monuments and that Syria is now the theatre of burning archaeological controversy. I understand, however, that other Oriental regions of the empire are to be represented in time. A consignment of casts, for instance, which the Russian government is sending from Etchmiadzin (anciently Valarshapat, built by the Romans, A.D. I63), to illustrate Roman Armenia, is said to be already on its way. AEGYPTUS (cat. p. I37). This survey of the provinces must close with a glance at Egypt.

Most of the imperial portraits exhibited here (statue and bust of Marcus Aurelius, bust of Septimius Severus, etc. from the museum of Alexandria) reproduce current types, created probably in Rome and sent out to the provinces. The FIG. 8. EGYPTIAN STATUE (P. 41). Egyptian statue with a head resembling that of Caracalla opens out a problem (fig. 8). Is this, as the catalogue suggests, the statue of an ancient Pharaoh with its head reworked into the image of a Roman emperor, or is it a contemporary statue of Caracalla as an Egyptian king ? The famous basalt head of the Barracco collection</page><page sequence="54">42 THE EXHIBITION ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROVINCES OF THE shews that Julius Caesar, or a Roman of his time, was portrayed in purely Egyptian fashion. So also were the two Roman officials, casts of whose statues, from Alexandria and Memphis respectively, are shewn here (cat. p. I38 with illustr.). In each the face and certain details of the drapery belong to the Graeco-Roman world, but the style, pose, and artistic conception are Egyptian. The immutable character of Egyptian (as distinct from Alexandrian) art and its obstinate fidelity to old forms evidently rendered it as impervious to Roman, as previously to Greek, influence. The Roman inscriptions of Egypt are richly represented. One sure to arrest attention is the tri-lingual record from Philae of the Ethiopian expedition of Cornelius Gallus.1 Among epigraphical curiosities are facsimiles of the names scratched on the colossal statue of Memnon at Thebes. The colossus was restored by Hadrian and two graffito autographs record the visit of the empress Sabina wife of Hadrian, and Balbilla, her lady-in-waiting. Another curiosity is a money box in the shape of a snake, from the temple of Aesculapius at Ptolemais; the open jaw of the snake is pierced, and it is probable that the animal emitted a volume of smoke in strict proportion to the offering deposited by the faithful in a slot visible within the coils on the left (cat. p. I 39, illustr.). Just outside the Egyptian section is arranged a magnificent set of reproductions after the famous portraits of the Fayum; near them are reproductions of Roman painted portraits in Italy, such as the well-known Paquius Proculus, baker of Pompeii and also at one time its " mayor," with his wife. We thus have an essay at an exhibition of Roman portraiture in painting, of real value to students. A selection from the portraits recently discovered by Prof. Flinders Petrie at Hawara would be in place in this instructive series. DACIA, MOESIA (second part of Roumanian section, cat. pp. I3I-I37). An apse of the Apodyterium of the Baths is filled with the re- mainder of the exhibits sent by Roumania, from ancient Dacia and Moesia. Here are admirable plans of Roman sites and forts, maps and drawings of Drobetae, of Axiopolis, of Tropaeum Trajani, stelae of soldiers, altars and a mass of inscriptions, among which is the reduced facsimile of the front face of the cenotaph put up by Trajan at Adamklissi in I08-IO9 B.C. in honour of the soldiers who died in some Dacian campaign, in honorem et memoriam lortissimorum virorum qui . . . pro republica morte occubuerunt, followed by a list of the names.

A picture of the more private, and at the same time more luxurious side of Roman civilisation is given by the " Galleria dei Tesori " in the small cloister. The delicate art of Augustan silver- smiths may be admired here in facsimiles of the famous treasure found at Hildesheim (museum of Berlin) ; of that of Bertouville near Bernay (Paris, Cabinet des Medailles) including the magnificent cups with male and female centaurs; of several pieces from the treasury of Boscoreale (Louvre), among them the celebrated cups with the skeletons. From the later imperial period is a disc (museum of Madrid) showing Theodosius enthroned between his sons Arcadius and Honorius within a tetrastyle portico, receiving the homage of a small figure advancing from the left. It is to be hoped that, if the exhibition becomes permanent, further examples will be procured of these late imperial discs or clipei: they are of much importance for the latter history of the antique. 1 Another re- markable exhibit is a galvanoplastic copy of the silver lanx found at Corbridge as far back as I735. 2 The drawing and the modelling of the figures have much in common with late ivories; the subject, an assemblage of Graeco-Roman divinities, seems to point to an Augustan model. The prominence given to Apollo and Diana irresistibly recalls the Phoebe silvarumque potens Diana, Lucidum coeli decus of the Carmen Saeculare. Apollo with his bow stands on the right in front of a shrine, holding a branch over an object which has been explained as the omphalos, and whose twelve compartments have suggested the twelve divisions of the zodiac ; on the left Diana with bow and arrow stands before an altar on an eminence from which flows a spring marked by an overturned urn; below on the left are the dog of Diana and the stag; on the right'is the griffin of Apollo, while the Apolline raven perches on a tree to the left of the picture. In the centre are three figures, Minerva, with her hand raised as if in welcome to Diana, and tw-o other goddesses whose identification is less sure.3 Behind the seated goddess is a sun dial (?) on a column. The scene is laid within a sacred grove, indicated by a tree from whose branches hang various votive objects. From the style of the art and the presence of solar emblems it seems probable that an earlier composition has been adapted to the taste of a later period. 1 The most important are well illustrated by A.

W. King (whose view is adopted in the Lapidarium) took the seated figure to be the Pythian priestess and the figure standing next to her to be Themis; other English writers have suggested Vesta and Latona; M.

The objects of pure gold found at Petrossa and now in the museum of Bucharest1 may be conjectured, from the Hellenic elements in them, to have been perhaps produced in the neigh- bourhood of the Pontic settlements. It is generally held that this treasure, which can scarcely be later than the third quarter of the fourth century, was carried away by the Goths as they fled south before the invasion of the Huns into what is now modern Rouniania2 (cat. p. I23). GREECE (cat. p. I I2). 3 The Greek section fills three galleries of the cloisters. It is unfortunate that this " Mostra Greca " is kept separate from the rest of the provincial exhibits and one cannot help regretting, too, that so little attention or space has been given here to Roman art in Greece, or to exhibiting the state of Greece under the Roman rule. There are, however, excellent photographs of the gate and stoa of Hadrian at Athens and of the Olympieion begun, it must be remembered, for Antiochus Epiphanes by a Roman architect Cossutius in 174 B.C. 4 The beautiful capitals of its columns wNere afterwards imitated in Rome for the circular temple by the Tiber. 5 There are also a few casts of emperors' busts from Athens. But we should have liked more examples of the Roman portraits in Olympia and of the splendid and too little studied series of the Kosmetai in the museum of Athens. It seems doubtful whether it was wise so to enlarge the original scope of the exhibition as to admit casts illustrative of the whole history of Greek art or reproductions of Cretan, Mycenaean (cat. p. IO9) and other pre- historic objects (cat. p. II7). The exhibition has thus lost unity. If its range was extended in order to illustrate the various influences which went to the making of Roman art, then it may be asked why only Greece is represented to the exclusion of Ionia, Syria, Etruria and the Orient. It is good news, however, that these Greek casts are destined, when the exhibition closes, to supplement Professor Loewy's admirable Museo dei Gessi. When this has been done, Rome will possess in that museum and in the museum which we hope and believe will grow out of the present exhibition, an archaeological apparatus second to none in Europe, matched, as it will be, by the museum and library at the Forum which Commen- I Published in A.

Among the many Greek exhibits the most remarkable are the casts of the Korai of the Acropolis, that make it possible, for the first time outside Athens, to study those exquisite statues in which, for one brief period, Greek artists touched the height of mediaeval achievement. These casts are accompanied by admirable water- colour drawings by Mdlle. Marie Enriques, showing the exact colouring of each statue. I must also call attention to the copy, by E. Stefani, of the Cretan sarcophagus of Hagia Triada which was found, it will be remembered, by Professor Paribeni, the director of the Musco delle Terme ; to the facsimile of the disk of Phaistos with the mysterious characters upon whose interpretation the learned world has lately expended much ingenuity; and, finally, to the frieze of mounted warriors found not long ago by the Italian excavators in the archaic Greek temple on the Acropolis of Prinia. The Byzantine branch of the Greek Mostra is of great importance, though it chiefly consists of photographs. These have been executed on a large scale for the Athens Committee of the exhibition, by the K6nigliche Messbildanstalt of Berlin, and reproduce practically every Byzantine church on Greek soil. The picture thus presented to us of the development of Greco- Byzantine architecture is probably the most complete ever given. The convent church of the Pantanassa at Mvlystra, the monasteries of Daphni near Athens, of Hosios Lukas in Phocis, the Panaghia Paregoritissa at Arta and several of the churches of the Meteora are reproduced with a wealth of detail which should warm the hearts of Byzantinists. I do not know whether the Greek section would afford material for an article in the 7ournal of Hellenic Studies, but the Editors of the 7ournal of Byzantine Studies should not neglect this Byzantine show. One of its features is a complete series of portraits of Byzantine emperors, brought together by Prof. Spyridion P. Lambros. Indeed the whole TMlostra is as important to Byzan- tinists as to " Romanists " and should teach the extreme party among the former how greatly they injure their cause when they dissociate it from that of Rome.

This would be a noble task for another exhibition, or for an annexe to this one. It is at present restricted to the remarkable group of Greek originals belonging to the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. which were found in recent years in the garden of Sallust and are now dispersed. Two male Niobids, probably from the pediment of a temple, and an Apollol of similar style are at Copenhagen in the Jacobsen collection, while the beautiful female figure, the too famous Niobid of the Banca Commerciale, which according to Furtwangler belonged to the same group as the male Niobids, is kept sequestered by the Italian government in the Castello of Milan. Opposite these Niobids are casts of two female draped torsos only slightly later in date (the so-called Artemis and Iphigenia) found at the same spot, now likewise at Copenhagen. 2 It is deplorable that these splendid specimens of Attic fifth-century art should have been lost to Rome, whose museums are com- paratively poor in Greek works of the best period. It will be remembered that the " Throne " with the " Weighing of the souls," which lay perdu for a quarter of a century and has now emerged from its hiding-place into the light of the Boston Museum, was also found in the gardens of Sallust, together with its pendant, the celebrated Ludovisi throne. A reunion by means of casts should be effected in this case also, that two works which should never have been separated may each complete and explain the other. It is hoped in time to shew casts of all the works of art taken away from the villa of Hadrian. A first instalment from Stock- holm, the gift of the king of Sweden, can already be seen in the Hall of the Imperium Romanum. Finally, the organisers of the exhibition have attempted the restoration of some half dozen monuments of which fragments are the property of the adjoining Museo delle Terme. Such is the mausoleum of the Platorini, which now affords a good idea of the sepulchral chamber of a Roman family under the empire. Such, again, is the basis adorned with the reliefs of dancing women found in I908 on the Via Prenestina (cat. pp. I169, 170) a poor copy of the Antonine age, as I judge it, after an Hellenistic composition, for which the Italian government paid a sum exceeding Ioo,ooo lire. Such, too, are the partial reconstruction of the Ara pacis, already alluded to, and a large altar of the Antonine age, identified by some as the Ustrinum Antoninorum, from the site now occupied by the Monte Citerio. In the Spanish section is a remarkable recon- I For the two Niobids, probably from a pedi- ment, see the Ny Carlsburg catal. 398, 399; for the Apollo, ibid. 32.

Lusius Storax at Chieti; it is in the shape of a tetrastyle temple with frieze representing gladiatorial games, and pediment with a unique picture of the audience arranged in tiers turned to face the beholder (cat. pp. 10I, I02). Last, but not least, the pavement of the small cloister containing the " Tesori " is formed by a splendid mosaic with hunting scenes in black and white1 (figs. 9, io). It is the gift of that distinguislhed archaeologist, Her Majesty Queen Elena, who discovered it in her excavations near Laurentum on the site of the Vicus Augustanus Laurentium. This little town the younger Pliny alludes to as separated by only one " villa " from his house, and as having conveniences enough for one whose wants were not many (Pliny, Epp. ii. 17, 26). Even in this long article it has been impossible for me to do more than indicate the general sweep and direction of the culture dis- closed by this remarkable assemblage of monuments. But the exhibition has an importance that extends far beyond its immediate scope. Several recent writers2 have pointed out that if we wish to know Rome, we must go elsewhere, remembering that the city and its civilisation found no less eloquent expression in the colonies and in the provinces than within the pomoerium. The study of Roman art, like that of Greek and even of oriental art, is being decentralised " we seek with reason in the provinces what the capital, ravaged a thousand times over, can no longer yield." 3 Travel must more and more be the necessary complement of archaeological research, and students of Rome must correct the one-sided impressions received in Rome herself by constant reference to the phenomena outside, must, as Prof. Haverfield puts it in the passage quoted above, let their "horizon broaden beyond the backstairs of the Palatine and the benches of the Curia to wide lands north and east and south of the Mediterranean." At the same time, Rome, however defaced and depleted, must needs remain the starting point of any survey of the Roman empire, and also the point of return. But what Rome had hitherto lacked is precisely what the present exhibition offers, a museum illustrative of the manifold life of the empire, where impressions gathered elsewhere may be tested, where the student may pass from the exclusiveness of special disciplines to contemplate the sphere of Roman influence as a whole. It is in such a place, for instance, that the range and complexity of the problem, " Orient or Rome ? " can be best appreciated; that the long and gradual interpenetration of East and West can I See Lanciani's account of the Queen's ex- cavations, Athenaeum, znd Sept.

The committee of the I9II exhibition deserve the warm praise and grateful thanks of the civilised world for the unflagging and intelligent zeal which they, have displayed in organising their archaeological section, and Prof. Lanciani, in whose ardent brain the project, we believe, first took shape, is to be further congratulated on having guided it to a triumphant conclusion. The illustrious scholar, who has devoted his life to the topography and monuments of ancient Rome, ever searching indefatigably for evidence that might help rebuild the vanished past, could not bettter crown his labours than by the exhibition which affords so clear a vision of the far-reaching influence of Rome. He ended his inaugural speech with the hope that he and his colleagues need not utter in front of the images of Rome and of Augustus the cry Ave Roma, Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant ! but that the exhibition might remain as the basis of a future museum of the Roman empire, " where Italian youth may seek inspiration for all those virtues which rendered Rome, morally as well as materially, the mistress of the world." We can only re-echo this wish, praying that it be made to include not young Italy alone but the youth of other countries also. At the moment of sending this article to press comes the news that the exhibition is to remain open at least till the end of next April. Those who are familiar with its contents will not hesitate to re- commend scholars and students, who have not yet seen the exhibition, to come to Rome and avail themselves of the chance which is still within their reach. The Mostra Archaeologica, which brings before the world in visible and convincing form our special subject of Roman Studies, ranks among the most significant archaeological events of recent years. The catalogue, with its numerous illustrations and its lucid descriptions, is largely the work of Dott. Giulio Giglioli, a young Italian scholar who has ably seconded Prof. Lanciani's labours in preparing for the exhibition. I desire to express my sincere personal thanks to the exhibition committee for the facilities of study which they have courteously granted me, and for the generous permission to use for this article a number of photographs taken to illustrate their catalogue. Dr. Emil Kruger of Trier has, with the utmost liberality, given me leave to reproduce certain of the photographs of the Igel monument taken for his museum, and Sefnor Pijoan has likewise placed several photographs at my disposal for my use in writing or in illustrating this article.</page></plain_text>
