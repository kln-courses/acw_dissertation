<plain_text><page sequence="1">Signs Of The Times DATELINES 'SHINING EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITY EXCELLENCE Heidi Juersivich, for The Roanoke Times: ROCKY MOUNT, Va. - A stiff green awning shields the sunlight from the windows of the Helms Farmers Exchange, a small country business in a red-brick building near the center of town, just yards away from the Franklin County Courthouse.... From a pair of worn chairs behind the counter inside the cramped, smoky building, the owner, Ramsey Helms, and his brother, William Helms, greet customers with the kind of soft-spoken gentility typical of people born and reared in rural Franklin County. Some say the Helmses are the kind of people who don't make much trouble. They pay their rent on time, let customers run tabs and treat people kindly.... But in a 56-page affidavit filed May 5 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in federal court in Roanoke, authorities allege that for decades the Helmses' farm supply business has operated as a front for their primary occupation: supplying raw materials to some of the most notorious producers of moonshine in Virginia and the Carolinas.... Within a four-year period, the Helms Farmers Exchange purchased enough 1-gallon containers to hold almost $7 million worth of moonshine. According to the affidavit, the business' profits on sugar sales alone averaged at least $100,000 a year for the past 10 years. Sugar is a key ingredient of illicit whiskey because it speeds fermentation.... Late last week, in a raid dubbed Operation Lightning Strike, agents with the ATF, the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Department and local authorities raided the homes of William and Ramsey Helms, the Farmers Exchange Store in Main Street and a warehouse on Virginia 40 east of town. idea, PAGE 4 - FALL 1999</page><page sequence="2">Investigators also raided the Franklin County homes of convicted moonshiners Ralph Hale and William "Dee" Stanley of Franklin County [background on Stanley, see "Whiskey Thicker'n Blood" in "Signs of the Times," Fall '98, pp. 5-8], plus a large still in Craig County and a smaller one in Pittsylvania County.... According to documents filed Wednesday in federal court in Roanoke, items seized in the raids included 29 100-pound bags of sugar, nearly 10,000 1-gallon jugs, about 150 1-quart Mason jars, numerous boxes of business records, more than $20,000 from the exchange office, a couple of jars of moonshine, a large map of North Carolina and even the family history album. This is the third time the Helmses' store has come to authorities' attention and the second time they have targeted it. In 1981, Ramsey Helms was called to testify before a federal grand jury in Roanoke and forced to surrender business records. Court records at the time listed Helms as a potential witness for an upcoming conspiracy trial, but the cases were settled by plea agreements. In 1988, local, state, and federal agents raided their business, seizing records for evidence of possible violations of federal tax and racketeering statutes. At the time, authorities claimed Ramsey Helms was fabricating invoices - even attributing sales to a dead man - to conceal large sales of raw materials to moonshiners. Two years later, the case was closed without explanation. No charges were filed. According to the affidavit, the Helms brothers' profits from sugar sales alone topped $1 million over the past decade.... The exchange allegedly also sold massive quantities of 1-gallon plastic jugs, half-gallon jars, wheat bran, rye grain, barley and yeast to known moonshiners. Workers at Shelburne Plastics of Jessup, Md., grew so accustomed to the Helmses' whopping orders for heavy-duty, screw-top, 1-gallon jugs that they simply marked each with an "F" for the Farmers Exchange .... The business was purchasing a minimum of about 17,000 jugs per month. "We sell plastic containers," said Ron Hill, sales manager for Shelburne Plastics. "We don't look at who's buying them ... I sell to many distributors, and what they do with the bottle after that, I haven't the foggiest idea." The federal document indicates that authorities believe the brothers formed two companies - Circle Cabs and H&amp;H Auto Sales - to conceal the money coming in. The companies operate out of the same building as the Farmers Exchange. Records show the taxi business employs only one driver and the PAGE 5 - APPALJ</page><page sequence="3">auto dealership has sold four vehicles in the past three years. News of the latest allegations was no surprise to the residents of Rocky Mount... "You'd be surprised how much liquor is made in this county today," said Henry Bousman, a freckle-faced man who ... was eating breakfast alongside a group of local folks at the Rocky Mount Hardee's Restaurant. Bousman said he was sentenced to five years' probation for hauling moonshine more than a decade ago. Td do it again if I could get by with it/' he said. Most people weren't so forthcoming. "'Round here you just don't go around telling everything you know," said David Perdue, an alignment technician at Renick Tire &amp; Alignment Service Inc., next door to the Helms Farmers Exchange. Perdue described the brothers as "the nicest guys you ever want to meet." ["Helmses are 'the nicest guys,' " 13 May 1999, pp. Al, A8] FOLLOW-UP: A week after Operation Lightning Strike, Ramsey Helms, 56, owner of the Helms Farmers Exchange, committed suicide. Ramsey's brother Bill Helms confirmed that their father also killed himself after Internal Revenue Service agents began snooping into their affairs in the late '80s. [Donald P. Baker, "Raids Attack Mystique of Moonshine Industry," Washington Post, 6 July 1999, p. B5] HAVE A SNORT AND GET YOUR LUBE RACKED GRANVILLE, W.Va. (AP) - Legal Moonshine? Well yes, two West Virginia entrepreneurs have received a license to distill the stuff of Southern legend, joining a handful of others around the country who are hoping to make clear corn whiskey a mainstream drink. Bo McDaniel, owner of a local autobody shop, and Payton Fireman, a lawyer in nearby Morgantown, are partners in the West Virginia Distilling Co. Recently they became the state's only licensed distillers and its first legal makers of the drink they will call Mountain Moonshine. They aren't the first in the nation to do it, but there is only a handful... McDaniel and Fireman are counting on the novelty of the product, and some marketing help from the state-run liquor wholesaling agency, to get their company started. "Everybody knows that mountain moonshine exists," said Fireman. "Very few people have ever had the oportunity to taste it." So far, Fireman and McDaniel haven't distilled a drop. Their start- up company will work in a converted bay of McDaniel's body shop with a formula to distill clear, 80-proof corn whiskey from fermented mash. The partners hope to produce as many as 1,000 cases by the end of the year. The first batches should be on the market by July, with a 750 ml bottle selling for about $12. PAGE 6 - FALL 1999</page><page sequence="4">"We'll have to perfect it on our own," said McDaniel, 56. "It's like baking a cake, I guess - although I've never baked a cake, either." The entrepreneurs aren't likely to get any help from their backwoods counterparts. "They're pretty secretive," McDaniel said.... McDaniel and Fireman have an important ally. Donald Stemple, the state Alcohol Beverage Control commissioner, has promised to help get the company started. West Virginia is one of 19 states that act as liquor wholesalers. Stemple said he will pitch Mountain Moonshine to his fellow liquor commissioners in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, for starters. "I think this will sell very well," Stemple said. Tom Pirko, the president of Bev- mark Inc., a New York-based management-consulting firm to the food and beverage industry, said that the partners may be onto something - "if they're clever and they play with it." "Spirits is marketing, marketing, marketing. You need some way to differentiate yourself," Pirko said. "They need to get tapes with the Deliverance music playing in the store." Fireman, 41, sees the venture as akin to the independent beer brewers that were highly popular earlier in the decade. "There is room for micro- distilleries just as there was in the beer business for micro-breweries," he said. Pirko, however, said that the concept will work only if the product is special. The micro-brewery business, for example, has shrunk substantially in recent years. "It came and it went in large part because consumers were confused, products were coming and going, product consistency wasn't good," Pirko said. Health-conscious folks aren't likely to seek out his product, but Fireman believes that Mountain Moonshine will appeal to moderate drinkers who are conscious of what they consume. "It's a purer, cleaner ethyl alcohol than scotch, for example," he said. If West Virginia Distilling is successful, Pirko predicted that major competition will spring up fast. "Suddenly there's going to be a moonshine section in the back of the package store .... The beverage business is the king of the knockoffs." Stemple, the liquor commissioner, doesn't worry much about competitors. With taxes running $13.50 a gallon of 100-proof liquor, he said, "It's a lot more profitable to do it illegally."

The Rev. James Henderson looked up at that same patch of earth and saw a Promised Land, a chance to create a shining city on a hill. To make his vision real, Henderson and about 200 of his neighbors will submit to an Alabama court next month a petition to incorporate the community of Brooksville as an official town run solely on Christian principles. Their plan is so simple it barely needs writing down: The town charter will be the King James Bible, its ordinances the Ten Commandments. "It is our intent to conduct the community's business according to the teachings of Jesus Christ," reads the charter, typed in all capitals. The rest of its rules follow naturally. For example: Observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy, you shall not murder, and you shall not steal. hîred ^ lawyer 6 o Henderson, a 57-year-old Pentecostal preacher and former Army colonel who earns a living as a defense contractor, is leading the effort with three of his friends from town, all past 60 and all of whom grew up to see their "sweet little town" assaulted by change. What drives them is a blend of religious moralism, radical libertarianism and a heavy dose of nostalgia. To the people downhill in neighboring Priceville, Henderson and his men are hopeless country dreamers, trapped by their memories of a South that no longer exists, where barefoot children chase rabbits and everyone meets at a clapboard church. But as Henderson sees it, it is those suburban bedroom folks who are trapped in a web of man-made regulations. Unlike their town, his will have "no property restrictions, no building permits, no paid mayor and council, no million-dollar town hall, no taxes, no red tape and no secrecy," he wrote in his newsletter. If you cut through the red tape and simply follow God's law, Henderson believes, the good in all of us will flourish. Under Brooksville's new covenant, he said, the scrappy community of a few hundred white, Protestant, blue- collar workers will show the world how neighbors are supposed to behave. They will check on each other to see who needs . ; ." - •»."/♦ " groceries, a ride to • ^¡fe^ r Vv " "1 : v ' school, a good joke or ^"^W &lt;^' V 0 ^ • ', ' some prayer.

If a sinner should sprout among them, his punishment will not come from a code book. The town may try "ostracizing" an adulterer or a homosexual, or residents may try showering him with love, kneeling before his doorstep to ask God to intervene in his life. "We see this town as another pulpit for Christianity," Henderson said. In his most hopeful estimate, the dream is only a few weeks away. In April a local probate judge rejected the petition to incorporate on technical grounds: There were too few signatures - 160 - for the proposed boundaries. After the hearing, the petitioners redrew the boundaries to a third their original size, collected about 80 more signatures and hired a lawyer. When they go back to the judge next month, though, the objections will not be so technical. The first time around, the judge never got to the question of whether a town could incorporate on Christian principles. Already the local American Civil Liberties Union, the mayor of Priceville and the Alabama League of Municipalities have let it be known that if the effort gets any further, they have a legal lesson prepared on the separation of church and state. Henderson is undaunted. Mention that constitutional edict to him and he'll tell you the town excludes no one. If someone objects to the prayer at the town hall meeting, "they can just show up 10 minutes late," he said.... A town full of radical Christians up on the hilltop seemed an affront to Priceville's civilized future, and several citizens organized a petition drive against it. Dot Brinkley, who volunteers at the church library now that she's retired from NASA, drove door to door to collect 384 signatures on her "Say NO to Brooksville" petition. "I'm a Christian and I believe in the Ten Commandments, but I also believe you need a written law," said Brinkley. "It sounds good, but you just can't operate that way. Even in biblical times they had rulers. I admit, I don't like many restrictions either. But I don't want my next door neighbor raising goats near my back yard." One of those who signed Brinkley's petition is Judy Blankenship, whose husband, David, is one of the four men who started the incorporation drive. Unlike her husband, Judy Blankenship is from the new generation, a blonde with a modern hairdo who speaks her mind. "You know the Hatfields and the McCoys?" she asked. "Well, you've just met them," she said of her husband and his friends. "They're just some overgrown boys who can't get their way." Her husband's gripe is visible from the window of his country store. One day he put up a new trailer selling fireworks 50 feet from where the old one had stood for years. But the strip of land under the new trailer happened to belong to Priceville, which doesn't allow mobile homes. Suddenly Blankenship found himself greeted by the Priceville police chief and building inspector, who threatened to jail him for three months....

But it is the music, not the smell, that has Thompson in court, defending his right to play Merle Haggard, Garth Brooks and Dolly Parton for his pigs. He swears it improves their disposition. The Florida Club, a golf course and subdivision with homes that sell for around $300,000, is suing Thompson, 60, and another farmer, claiming that the country music they play bothers its golfers. Thompson says he is being told how to live his life by the new, richer residents who are encroaching on what used to be a wild, simple place, "just one more case of the rich developers running over the little guy." A trial date has not been set. Greg Cotten, the general manager of the Florida Club, insists that its members only want to play in peace, and that the legal challenge is a simple lawsuit designed to halt a nuisance. The club seeks no damages, just reduced volume. PAGE 10 - FALL 1999</page><page sequence="8">"This guy is persisting with his story of the big developers squeezing him out," which is false, Cotten said. "He's welcome to stay there." Lawyers for the club have said that Thompson and the neighbor who also raises music-accented pork, Tom Rossano, want the club to buy their property at an inflated price, to gain peace and quiet.

Baker, in the Washington Post POUND, Va. - There isn't much to do in this hamlet tucked into the farthest reaches of the Cumberland Mountains .... A new four-lane highway bypassed the town a few years ago, and the nearest fast-food restaurant is 12 miles away. But a federal judge is helping to liven up the place. His ruling has many residents here kicking up their heels. Literally. They're dancing - and for the first time in 18 years, it's legal. There are some, of course, who take a dim view of the court ruling, which declared the town's stringent ordinance against dancing unconstitutional. It will, they warn, lead to all sorts of trouble. Dancing, after all, seldom occurs all by itself. "I like to dance," said teetotaling town council member Danny Stanley, who supported the now-discredited ordinance, "but I don't think you can mix drinking, country music and dancing without having a problem." That mix has been on tap for a week now at the Golden Pine, a honky-tonk at the edge of town, where they've been openly celebrating District Court Judge Glen M. Williams's decision that Pound's law violated the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The law required anyone wanting to hold a dance to get a permit from the town council, and it was Golden Pine owner William "Rusty" Elam who challenged it in court. Now the declared winner, Elam has put a sign outside his bar that says "Let's Dance," and inside, his customers are scribbling their signatures on a wall banner proclaiming, "I was there when Pound danced." ... The Pound ordinance was so restrictive, Williams found, that "a for-profit performance of The Nutcracker' ballet would require prior approval of the town council." The judge said, "It is clear that the town council could craft a more narrow ordinance aimed at controlling the perceived evils associated with dancing." And Mayor Belva B. Boiling pledged to do just that. "We're going to draft a new law," she said at a reception for a new town manager. In the meantime, couples are rocking and rolling to tunes pumped out by a succession of local musicians at the Golden Pine. Thursday night featured Donnie Falin, who by day runs the local sewage treatment plant and by night plays the guitar and harmonica. Thursday night, David and Kelley Sturgill and another couple drove from their homes in nearby Jenkins, Ky., through the Pound Gap, to take advantage of the newfound freedom in Pound. "It's not like there's a lot of things to do around here. This is it," said Kelley Sturgill, 29, sipping a beer from a long-neck bottle as she tapped her toe to the music and tried to coax her husband onto the dance floor. David Sturgill, a 31-year-old employee of Kentucky public television, blamed the dancing ban on "religion and Virginia blue laws. PAGE 12 - FALL 1999</page><page sequence="10">Why, you can't even hunt on Sundays. I thought there was separation of church and state." Even so, Virginia's laws are more liberal than those in Sturgill's home of Letcher County, Ky., where alcohol is illegal. Until last month's court order, the Sturgills and their friends Brad and Kimberly Johnson had to drive 30 miles, either east to Norton, Va., or west to Pikesville, Ky., to drink beer and dance.... In a 17-page opinion that would have made Fred Astaire smile, Williams declared that "dancing between adults often has a definite communicative element, such as expression directed to attract a mate in a bar or a discotheque." And he went on, quoting the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, that "dancing itself seems to involve the enactment, at some deep level, of community norms and expectations." ["Va.

A special exhibit on the Ainu at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History opened April 30th. The Associated Press reported: "...Early European and American visitors once speculated that the Ainu were a lost tribe of Caucasians, though most anthropologists consider them descendants of ancient Asian peoples.... "Unlike their Asian neighbors, the Ainu are more muscular and have wavy hair and deep-set eyes. The men tend to grow full, bushy beards; the women tatoo their lips, arms and hands. "Researchers are at a loss to find good links between the Ainu language and others, though some have suggested the ancient Central Asia language Altaic, some Pacific native languages and even American Indian connections...."

I was in the Baltimore Sun newsroom, strolling past a pair of sober-looking business writers, guys in suits and white shirts, ties knotted neatly. They were speaking PAGE 13 - APPALJ</page><page sequence="11">with a woman from the sports department I figured she was getting an investment tip, some advice on a mutual fund. Then I heard one of the guys say: "Yeah, it would have been a lot different if Ricky Rudd hadn't come up on his tail like that" Ricky Rudd? They were talking about stock- car racing, rehashing the previous weekend's NASCAR event as if it had been Game 7 of the World Series. That's when it hit me: Redneck culture has taken over America. All the things that, years ago, a North Carolina boy intuitively knew he'd have to leave behind if he was ever to be accepted in a wider world have become trendy, popular, mainstream. And the more I looked around, the more I realized that the evidence was everywhere, like some vine creep of kudzu grown wild overnight For starters, look who's running the country: A paunchy skirt-chaser from the foot of the Ozarks. His key political sage? A loudmouth known as "The Ragin' Cajun." The top guy in the Senate is a former cheerleader from Ole Miss. As for the House, its members might have gotten rid of that pudgy Georgia boy named Newt, but then they had to try out a quiet philanderer from Louisiana before finally settling on someone north of the Gnat Line (if you can call Illinois an improvement).... Turn on your radio, and what are the things that just won't go away? Country music and Rush Limbaugh clones, the latter crowd endorsing everything from your right to own a whole bunch of guns to the pleasures of puffing, Boss- Hawg-style, on "premium cigars." Television isn't much different The nation's top-rated cable shows during a recent week featured NASCAR and pro wrasslin'. Throw in bass fishing, and you've got the Holy Trinity of Dogpatch. The open road offers no escape. Ruling the highway are fleets of glorified pickup trucks and four- wheel drives - only instead of displaying gun racks and "USA 1" tags, they've got stickers of Bryn Mawr and Boys' Latin. What's the biggest snack treat to hit Baltimore more recently, not to mention Manhattan? It's a deep- fried doughnut from North Carolina called the Krispy Kreme.... How does America shop these days? From home. Just like when the Sears catalog doubled as bathroom accessory and indispensible consumer tool, for those of us who lived too far from the city to drive in the pickup to shop. For those who still bother to get off the couch, there's always Wal-Mart, a chain launched in Arkansas.... Then there's NASCAR, toasted from New York to Hollywood, with every state in America seemingly building, or wanting to build, a racetrack. Jeff Gordon is the new Michael Jordan. If you're seeking an alternative, roller derby is back. Time was, a fellow growing up in the nation's outer reaches figured that the only way to make a mark in life was to conquer the big city, PAGE 14 - FALL 1999</page><page sequence="12">preferably New York. As the song says, if you could make it there, you could make it anywhere. That's why for decades Southerners marched north so their fellow Americans could make fun of the way they talked. Now, perhaps, the day is nigh when New York mothers will fondly kiss their sons and daughters goodbye on the doorstep of urban ruin, then lovingly help them aboard Greyhounds bound for places such as Darlington, Tupelo, Macon and Gastonia. As for all us longtime refugees from the hinterlands, schooled - by a Southern novelist - to believe that "you can't go home again," the new message is more accepting, but no less daunting: "You don't need to go home again.

A13] LOTTA LUGNUTS SUCKING FUMES Randall Bloomquist, in the Washington Post ...In this age of microprocessors and cloning, diversity and moderation, a simple-minded sport in which good oP boys burn copious amounts of gasoline, rubber and industrial lubricants as they tear around an oval track is the hottest entertainment ticket in the country. Under the careful, crafty eye of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), stock car racing has gone from back-woods diversion to big-time boom sport, far bigger and richer than most of the sports that dominate the pages of certain metropolitan daily newspapers. NASCAR's premier event, the Winston Cup series, is the only sport to have increased its TV rating every year since 1990. Seventeen of the 20 most- attended sporting events of 1998 were Winston Cup races. A staggering 180 million people watched the races on TV. The Winston Cup drew 6.3 million spectators to 36 events; the NFL drew 15 million to 240 games. According to the most recent figures, NASCAR is a $2 billion-a-year industry. Simply put, Winston Cup racing - a series of 36 races held on 22 tracks all around the nation from February to November - is the new American spectacle. And rightly so. A Cup race celebrates our national passion for excess. It's a grotesquely commercialized event in which super- powered cars make dangerous amounts of noise while chasing millions of dollars in prize money before a vast crowd that spent lots of money to overindulge in sun, fun, food and drink. The cars are so heavily plastered with advertisements that you usually can't tell the brand of a car unless you read the program. Only in America, indeed. As my own transformation proves, you needn't be a motorhead - or even work in an auto parts supply house - to enjoy a day at the speedway. A NASCAR race is an event, a happening, a sort of redneck Preakness. And while you can observe this fm de siècle phenomenon from the comfort of your living room, like all great art forms it demands to be observed firsthand to be appreciated in all its nuances. PAGE 15 -APPALJ</page><page sequence="13">"It's like the circus," says Richmond International Speedway spokesman Kenneth Campbell. "You can watch it on TV, but you really need to get out here and smell the elephants." ... The infield is holy ground for racing hard-cores, the folks who follow the Winston Cup circuit in everything from $300,000 motor homes to rusted school buses with swivel chairs bolted to the roof. This part of the infield often radiates a wild joie de vivre and eccentricity, a kind of temporary playground dedicated to all sorts of fun. There are parties and cookouts everywhere, ïou may see a carefully crafted "Hooter's Try-Outs Here!" sign - a piece of plywood featuring two cantaloupe-size holes at chest height. Or a castle built out of beer cans. You might even run into a driver or two, as they often stay in their own palatial mobile mansions parked right there on the grass.... ...saunter among the rows of souvenir peddlers and watch the oh- so-colorful racin' crowd go by. (And you thought the tube top was dead!) The speedways usually offer some sort of pre-race entertainment designed to encourage early arrivals. In Charlotte the race honchos are partial to military extravaganzas. My personal jaw-dropping favorite was a special forces hostage-rescue demonstration, which included a swarm of helicopters and a couple of Humvees. The object of the exercise was to snatch up the speedway's mascot, an anthropomorphic bolt named Lugnut, from the clutches of an unseen enemy. Smoke, dust, explosions, mock gunfire, deafening noise - the perfect speedway pre-race drama. And the crowd loved it, especially when the safe and sound Lugnut took a victory lap in a Humvee.... Another key to following the action is to choose a driver to call your own. Focusing your attention on a particular car gives you a personal stake in the race, and provides a focal point for learning about strategy and tactics - drafting, goin' high, etc. But choose wisely; your selection will say a lot about you to your fellow race attendees - especially after you've dropped $100 on hats and T-shirts sporting your guy's likeness and sponsor logo. There are many ways to settle on a driver. You can go with personalities: Dale Earnhardt is the old-school tough guy; Jeff Gordon is the golden child; Mark Martin is the scrappy little guy who's always in the thick of it...

Davitt McAteer, last seen in June on a trip to Eastern Europe and Russia while his administrative assistant watched his kids in West Virginia, is worried these days about a cash crunch. Expenses "are running higher than expected," he wrote in a May 3 memo to senior staff, in part because PAGE 16 - FALL 1999</page><page sequence="14">of high costs in dealing with some mine fires. "We must manage our available resources to cover these additional expenses," he wrote, so "delay hiring as long as possible ... delay or curtail [other personnel moves] ... manage travel to minimize expenses and ensure that adequate funds remain available for field inspection and investigation activities; and, delay purchase of supplies and equipment to the extent feasible." The memo was met with some derision among the rank and file, judging by our mail. For starters, detractors said, maybe McAteer could cut back on his overseas travel and save a few bucks. Since the June trip, he went to Luxembourg in October for a three-day conference and to South America for 11 days in August, and he just got back from a six-day trip to Switzerland and South Africa. "These are trips that the governments have asked us" to take to improve mine safety in those countries, McAteer said, noting that the trips were taken or committed to before the budget problems surfaced. "We think they were value- added trips," he said, to "globalize safety and health" standards for mining and to ensure U.S. companies can compete. And even one critic observed that fewer pencils are used while he's abroad, "so we can delay additional purchases of supplies and save money." ["In the Loop," 26 May 1999, p.

The editors of the Watauga Democrat, in the headwaters county for the New River, did not like the photographs: "...When more than 10 million readers around the planet open the magazine this month, they'll find a dirty, shirtless coal miner in a locker room, a big woman standing on a porch with a tattered shirt and toothless grin, a cashier in a general store and a bluegrass band.... "The problem is [that such images are] how outsiders tend to perceive rural mountain folks.... "For most readers, it's as close to Appalachia as they'll ever get. "Why not a Christmas tree farm, cows grazing on steep hillsides, a festival, tourists - or one of the many other sights found here? ... "We just think the images - viewed collectively - ... give the impression that our residents are a bunch of illiterate hillbillies."

Bill McKelway reported on the event, characterizing some of the teachers who inspired the young writers, starting with Richard H.W.

"Boyishly charming and in the words of a friend 'half hillbilly, half Nabokov/ Dillard has managed marriages to two of his students (one of them for 10 years to Annie Dillard), overseen a creative writing program famous for its roguish but pure motives, and established himself as one of the country's most respected writers and teachers...."

In the yards men tinkered with the undersides of rusty cars while their women drank beer and nursed babies. They were from Appalachia - you knew by the accent My husband, Dennis, liked these hill people and the raw sensuality he saw in them. I think he wanted to be like them. He wanted weeds in his yard, a walleyed child with a bouquet of dandelions, a rust- eaten car that would take him nowhere...." Tears that the Oxford American essay was an out-take, a spin-off, a fast- food McEssay based on a larger joint project co-authored by Dennis and Vicki called Cleaving: The Story of a Marriage (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1999), "a study in excruciating candor," according to Marsha Barber in Mountain Xpress. Excruciating as in there's nothings won't tell you about the intimate details of our lives, from self-destructive alcoholism to bed- hopping to the play-by-play procedures of an abortion. Since the book came out, the Birmingham Southern Baptist church the Covingtons were members of and deacons in has shunned them, and local Alabama talk-radio gas bags have offered the couple up as proof that American culture is depraved. (Are talk-radio gas bags proof that the Far Right eats its young?) Vicki's essay in particular makes Dennis's ecstatic flirting with serpents and God in Salvation on Sand Mountain more understandable. Like the man said, all history is psychology.

In 1999, it's transformed itself into theater-in-the- round redone as 'roid rage, jam- packed with charismatic, monumental players, prime-time- worthy production values, and labyrinthine plot machinations (backstabbing, allegiance hopping, and the eternal quest for title belts) that make Melrose Creek 90210 look like Teletubbies. The forces behind these operatic shenanigans are two multi- million-dollar leagues, the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling, and one postmodern twist: Contemporary fans are hip to wrestling's fakery, and they revel in it. They're drawn to both choreographed pile driving and the internecine, ongoing story lines that pit rank-and-file grapplers against each other and their evil corporate taskmasters.... Along with these soapy scenarios - scripted by staff writers and league execs - today's wrestling boasts a new breed of wrestler. More thespian than thug, they include WWF's big, bald finger- flipping maverick, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, 34, and WCW's big, bald Semitic avenger, Goldberg, 32. Together with the rest of the motley ensembles ... they headline a series of peripatetic live shows as well as 15 hours of TV programming watched by an estimated 35 million a week. But it's not just the leagues and wrestlers that are different - so are those fans. No longer catering to just hyperactive children and dentally impaired trailer dwellers, wrestling is courting an increasingly sophisticated, upscale audience. Between 1997 and 1998, the WWF, according to the USA Network, has experienced a 156 percent increase in rating among viewers with four or more years of college, while the rating among households with incomes of $50,000 or more are up 111 percent. "They've aimed at an older crowd," says MIT Comparative Media Studies professor Henry Jenkins, author of the essay "'Never Trust a Snake': WWF Wrestling as Masculine Melodrama." "They've created a morally ambiguous universe, with antiheroes and sympathetic villians. It's appealing to a Pulp Fiction crowd." Madison Avenue is taking notice; advertisers such as Coca-Cola, Coors, 20th Century Fox, and ABC are now wrestling regulars. "Fortune 500 companies have awakened to the fact that pro wrestling has an appeal beyond the stereotypes of the past," says Burke Stinson of AT&amp;T, yet another blue-chip company diving into the squared circle....

The two of them published a book in 1992 as testimony to their change of heart, Simple Living: One Couple's Search for a Better Life. Now Levering and Urbanska have teamed up with Vivia Boe and John de Graaf, documentary producers from Seattle, to form Simple Living Productions Inc. to develop a series of 13 30-minute programs for PBS called Simple Living. Boe produced a show about Levering and Urbanska's move back to the country, Running Out of Time, which aired on PBS in 1994. "What we're trying to emphasize is that we don't have to be a throwaway culture," Urbanska said. "Everything we see in the media is about buying more and consuming more. What about sticking with what we have and making things simpler?"

Byrd was given a moving violation in Fairfax County, Virginia, when he rammed the back of a Ford van with his rented Cadillac. But when Fairfax County officials discovered that one of their officers had cited the senator, Commonwealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan Jr. (D) decided the summons was null and void based on Article 1, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution, which was written in 1781 to protect members of Congress from harassment as they traveled across the country. The Commonwealth's Attorney interpreted the clause to mean that members of Congress could not be issued a traffic ticket while Congress was in session. After the news got out in the Washington Post that Byrd had beaten the rap, he decided he wanted the summons reinstated, and on July 19 he showed up and sat patiently on the crowded benches of traffic court until his case was called and then spoke four words: "I plead no contest." He paid $30 in court costs but received no fine. (Judge Robert J. Smith said the fine was normally $50, but for first offenders who plead guilty or no contest in their first appearance, the judge typically suspends the fine.) Byrd will also receive four points on his driving record for what his staff said was his first traffic ticket. Plus he did the honorable thing, when his position could have gotten him a special privilege. [Tom Jackman, "Sen. Byrd's Day In Traffic Court," Washington Post, 20 July 1999, pp. Bl, B7] PAGE 21 - APPALJ</page></plain_text>
