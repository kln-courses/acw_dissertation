<plain_text><page sequence="1">Metaphors of Librarianship: A Suggestion for a Metaphysical Model Joseph Z. Nitecki The broad purpose of this essay is to suggest to the reader an approach to librarianship which will relate the formal, passive, and, by necessity, detached theory of library science to the subjective, dynamic, and personal involvement of each library patron. Any li brary can be viewed as a systematically organized collection of vol umes accessible to the library public; it can also be perceived as potential new knowledge, contained in each of its volumes, and ready for discovery by the individual library user. The former ap proach stresses the physical library of the vehicles of recorded knowledge, arranged on the shelves or stored in the files; the latter viewpoint emphasizes the conceptual library, expressed symboli cally in the content of these vehicles. Each print, or nonprint, unit of a library collection is the final product of someone's creative process, and at the same time it is a potential beginning of a new, subjective perception of that crea tion by an individual library reader. It is proposed that the essence of librarianship is metaphysical and hence, the controversy over librarianship's claims to a philo sophical status can be better understood if analyzed metaphorical ly. A model illustrating a metaphorical interpretation of basic con cepts in library science is sketched and its usefulness in the theory of librarianship is discussed. The meaning of the metaphor itself is interpreted metaphorically; its conceptual structure is used as an il lustration of the library method of disseminating knowledge through integrating known and less-known relationships into new insights of reality.

Introduction The search for a common denominator in the discussion con cerning the philosophical bases of librarianship resembles a series of ripples chasing each other on the still surface of a lake. The ongoing dialogue was animated some forty years ago by Danton's "Plea for a Philosophy of Librarianship,"1 in which he argues for a definition of library purposes as a necessary starting point for a social philosophy of librarianship. Danton has postponed his expectation for a metaphysical for mulation of such a philosophy until librarians agree on a common world view.2 Such an agreement, however, is nowhere in sight. Numerous published essays merely reinforce the elusive nature of librarian ship; each essay views librarianship from a different vantage point. Yet, these different interpretations do not necessarily negate each other, but, on the contrary, by focusing on less known relation ships, they may expand the scope of the field. Each definition is metaphorical in the sense of defining the concept of librarianship in terms of different characteristics of the discipline. What follows are a few examples selected from the current liter ature to illustrate the metaphorical structure underlying different library hypotheses. This brief review is not intended as an in-depth analysis; such a study would require an extensive discussion, con siderably expanding the format of this introductory presentation. Among the proponents of a philosophy of librarianship, Broad field, for example, argues for "the philosophy of librarianship which ... is not constructed on the usual basis of the library's obligations to society, but on the basis of the library's service to man."3 The key concept in this view is the individual. On the other hand, Brod erick considers society as the central component in the philosophy of librarianship. "The time has come," she argues, "for the library to recognize that its primary responsibility today is to the other agencies of society and only secondarily to the individual who walks through the doors."4 Irwin goes even further. He questions the very meaning of the concept of a philosophy of librarianship. Library science, accord ing to him, is a field of applied bibliography, of an art of recording, and of a science of making books: "bibliography is indeed the heart of the whole subject; everything else in librarianship revolves round this central nucleus."5 Similar conceptual difficulties are also experienced among the information scientists. Some of them reflect Fairthorne's anti-meta physical rigidity in defining the scope of the concept information</page><page sequence="3">23 as, for example, expressed in his Morphology of Information Flow.6 Other writers argue for the relaxation of a definitional approach to information, "for the purpose of discussing its many 'metaphorical' meanings."7 Among the most recent writers, Wright, discouraged, or possibly encouraged, by his finding "that there is not one single philosopher librarian anywhere in America today," went back to The Oral An tecedents of Greek Librarianship* to formulate his well-researched metaphysics of information. His refreshing approach, based on the Greek disjunction of rea son and senses, classifies librarianship together with Kaplan's meta sciences, as a humanistic rather than scientific, and idealistic rather than materialistic, creation of man. This assumption allows Wright to stipulate that "librarianship and philosophy may turn out to be, not merely similar, but identical."9 Wright's Platonic interpretation of the concept information is based on a metaphor of humanistic idealism. "We should be fol lowing Plato into the heart of man," Wright argues metaphorically, "for that is where the human information problem must ultimate ly be resolved."10 Also metaphorical are the philosophical beliefs of Wright's men tors, Shera, who wrote the foreword to Wright's recent book, and Kaplan, whose writings, in Wright's opinion, "may well be the only honest-to-goodness philosophical statement in all of library liter ature."11 Shera's philosophy of the librarian's social role is well expressed in his metaphor of social epistemology. This approach seems to re flect the commitment of Shera's own alma mater, the University of Chicago's library school, to an ideal of a librarian as a "mission ary of the human mind," who ought to provide a "synthesis of two attitudes toward librarianship?the humanistic and the social scientific."12 Kaplan's concept of metascience, conceived as the intellectual foundation of library science, equates the discipline with logic, linguistics, mathematics, and information theory; all of them are based on metaphorical concepts of structure, order, and form.13 An English librarian, Orr, in his treatment of Libraries as Com munication Systems,14 relates various laws of general systems the ory to libraries as systems. This approach implies holism, which is a methodological as well as an ontological metaphorical premise of the general systems theory's "assumption that sets of related events can be treated collectively, as systems manifesting functions and properties on the specific level of the whole."15</page><page sequence="4">24 J LH/Metaphors of Librarianship A good, persuasive illustration of the metaphorical nature of the theoretical bases of librarianship is provided by the current contro versy over the historical revisionism represented by Michael Harris. In his study "The Purpose of the American Public Library: A Re visionist Interpretation of History" Harris questions the myth "that the public library movement began in a passion of liberal and humanitarian zeal," as a reflection of "the power of popular democracy in this country."16 Harris's essay critically evaluates a series of myths, which were propagated at different times as goals and objectives of the American library movement. In another study, Harris further expands the examination of a metaphorically "re curring cycle of fitful and outer-directed commitment to crusades . . . followed by periods of ambivalence."17 The importance of Harris's position to the hypothesis of this essay is in his criticism not of the myths per se, but of their literal interpretation. Myths are, in fact, often defined as metaphors taken literally. Similarly, Harris's critics do not deny the existence of myths; their arguments concern the meaning of the myths, their metaphorical interpretations.18 Thus, for example, Phyllis Dain, in her metaphorically titled ar ticle "Ambivalence and Paradox: The Social Bonds of the Public Library,"19 debates Harris's "exploratory hypotheses" on grounds of lacking sufficient evidence, and as being too emphatic. In ef fect, she criticizes Harris's metaphors as incomplete and oversim plified; she does not, however, reject them. Harwell and Michener20 also do not deny the existence of meta phors discussed by Harris. Instead, they further elaborate the rela tionship by providing still another interpretation of the same basic metaphors. Thus, for example, they do not negate the existence of self-interest among the nineteenth-century library leaders brought up by Harris, but they insist that this metaphor has to be "rightly understood." Their main thrust is an argument for the interpreta tion of the meaning of Harris's myths within the context of the metaphors' environment. They claim that words, or metaphors, such as intellectual or elitist "had no currency in their time" be cause the leaders in these days "were merely products of their tra dition, which was neither intellectualist nor elitist, just liberal."21 Thus, Harwell and Michener are, in fact, saying that concepts such as self-interest or liberalism were defined differently a hun dred years ago. However, the terms were then, and I maintain are still now, used metaphorically. In each of the examples cited, a different aspect of librarianship is spotlighted, thus bringing out, to use Burke's description of a</page><page sequence="5">25 metaphor, "the thisness of a that, or the thatness of a this" aspect of library science.22 I wish here to argue for a relativistic viewpoint in librarianship. Such an approach ought to be based not only on the belief that there are always at least two sides to each issue, but more impor tant, that no two interrelationships between the same concepts are ever exactly the same. Every time a concept is communicated to a different person, and often even to the same person at differ ent times, it emerges as a novel, even if only slightly modified, re lationship. The process of integrating such changes into one's own total knowledge, by comprehending or perceiving new relations, is a basic creative aspect of learning. It is also the essence of the con ceptual metaphor, and it is, I propose, the elan vital of librarian ship. II. Metaphor A. General Concept In a dictionary sense, a metaphor is defined as a figure of speech, describing a concept or an object in terms of its similarity to an other concept or object. An example of a metaphor, which is less than flattering to librar ians, was once provided by Dewey's observation that "the time was when a library was very like a museum, and a librarian was a mouser in musty books."23 An example of a more pleasing and fre quently heard metaphor is the saying that the library is the heart of the university. The two metaphors introduce opposing attributes of librarianship; the former of an old, often closed, stuffy library, the latter of a library as a very active, essential unit within the uni versity. Still another image of the library is suggested by Gore, when he talks about "a library that can metaphorically be called a mirror of the universe, a reflector of things that may appear true or false, pious or blasphemous, beautiful or ugly, depending on who is looking in the mirror."24 In the literature on the subject, at least three different types of metaphors are distinguished: rhetorical, conceptual (often referred to as cognitive), and "dead" metaphors (figure 1). Rhetorical metaphors are employed as linguistic devices for es thetic or decorative effects, although indirectly, they may also sug gest a new meaning for an old expression.

Schematic Outline for the Discourse on Metaphors in Librarianship</page><page sequence="7">27 of the invention of writing is of this type: "The goose quill put an end to talk. It abolished mystery. ... It was the basic metaphor with which the cycle of civilization began, the step from the dark into the light of the mind."25 Conceptual metaphors are used to explain the metaphysical or epistemological attributes of human knowledge. Shera, for example, states that "the key to the true meaning of librarianship is to be found in the power of the brain to translate the symbolism of the written word into vicarious experience, as similate and store this experience in the memory, and reactivate it on demand." He concludes this metaphorical description by saying that "the traditional metaphor of the library as the memory of civilization may have more validity than has been realized, for the brain is also the library of the individual."26 The essence of the conceptual metaphor is its translucence, which diffuses a given, original meaning of a concept by expressing it through another, expanded meaning. And finally, there are "dead" metaphors, the metaphorical ex pressions, concepts, or even theories, which have come to be as similated into everyday language, or have been co-opted by sci entific theories, losing their metaphorical implications in the pro cess. Thus, for example, the phrases struggle for existence, or natural selection, although originally used by Darwin metaphorically, are today quite often interpreted literally. Similarly, technical terms such as field, force, and in library jargon, catchword index, or run ning head, were once introduced metaphorically.27 Metaphors are also used, although at times subconsciously, as basic premises of philosophical theories, such as Kantian things-in-themselves, or atomic models in science. Unfortunately, literature also abounds in false metaphors, illus trating their misuse. This happens whenever the interpretation is based on irrelevant relationship between the concepts brought to gether in a metaphor. The two most frequent misuses of metaphors are the literal interpretation of the meaning of a metaphor, and its conceptual misinterpretation. For example, a series of humorous centerfold sketches, published in a recent issue of American Librar ies,28 visually illustrates the point, by offering a nonlibrarian artist's literal, laughable interpretations of the meanings of such dead meta phors as authority file, serials librarian, and shared cataloging. On the other hand, a metaphorical comparison of a computer with the human mind, together with a whole new nomenclature in computer science, based on this falsely assumed similarity, is a good example</page><page sequence="8">28 JLH/Metaphors of Librarianship of a conceptual misrepresentation of the relationship between the two types of activities.29 The metaphorical interpretation of philosophical and scientific phenomena has, of course, its proponents as well as its opponents. Among the best-known contemporary protagonists of a meta phorical approach are Pepper, who developed a root-metaphor theory of philosophy,30 and Kuhn, who interpreted the scientific revolutions in terms of the changes in the prevailing paradigms (i.e., metaphors) of a given period.31 The metaphorical viewpoint is strongly opposed by positivism. According to Topitsch, for example, the use of metaphors in sci ence exemplifies a prescientific, although sophisticated, applica tion of ancient mythology, which, he maintains, hampers the de velopment of science.32 Thus, metaphors do mean, as they should, different things to different people. So, although in the eighteenth century Fitzos borne recommended that metaphors "ought to be entirely banished from the severer compositions of philosophy,"33 in this century, Hulme thinks that "the history of philosophy should be written as that of seven or eight metaphors"34; Wittgenstein's key metaphor in Tractatus35 is the statement that "a proposition is a picture of reality ... a model of reality as we think it to be"; while to Robert Frost "all thinking is metaphorical."36 In this paper, the discussion of metaphors is limited to their conceptual forms only (figure 1). Within this category, metaphors are often used casually, heuristically, or structurally, each use af fecting our conceptual interpretations of reality.37 Casual use of metaphors is characterized by their sporadic and direct application. It is accepted as an almost self-explanatory, tautological expression, not requiring, nor inviting, any further analytical examination. The statement "a library is a storehouse of books" illustrates this type of metaphor; it refers directly to a library as a physical depository of printed material. Of course, not all casual metaphors are automatically acceptable to all librarians. Gore, for example, considers "the perils of publicly declaring that a library is a storehouse of knowledge," since some books in the library may not meet the criterion of knowledge, al though they should be in the library for other reasons.38 In a heuristic approach, a metaphor is used as a tool in discover ing new meaning by stimulating interest in a unique relationship. This approach opens up new possibilities for further analytical in vestigations. A comparison of the library to the memory of a so ciety is a good example of a heuristic application of metaphors. It</page><page sequence="9">29 suggests a number of possible, initially intangible relationships be tween the content of a library collection and the cultural heritage of the society. Structural use of metaphors, which is often found in the devel opment of theoretical models, refers to an assumed similarity be tween the model itself and the phenomena explained by it. This use is most significant in providing coherent, theoretical frame works for new hypotheses. History of science offers many instances of this type of meta phorical approach, such as the use of Euclidean, Newtonian, or Darwinian models in fields such as economics or ethics. In infor mation science, Goffman's Epidemic Theory of Communication, by comparing the spread of ideas to the spread of diseases, utilizes a medical model for explaining the relevance of information in documents.39 The metaphysical model of librarianship proposed in this paper is based on a structural interpretation of conceptual metaphors. B. Metaphorical Metaphysics and Its Model All metaphysical theories are based on some conceptual meta phors for at least two reasons. First, a metaphor allows a metaphy sician to use "one part of experience to illuminate another?to help us understand, comprehend, even to intuit, or enter into the other."40 Second, a metaphysical methodology is a dialectic, or linguistic, relational analogy between phenomena and their inter pretations. Such metaphysical methodology is based on a multi varied meaning of any concept, seen differently when observed from different perspectives, and expressed linguistically by using a metaphorical structure. "Metaphor is an open perspective of real ity and part of reality is constituted by the way in which we con ceive it. Reality cannot be limited to a single perspective. It is al ways changing."41 Furthermore, a metaphor provides a new, stereoscopic insight into the metaphysical reality. "While constructing one mode of reality in terms of the other, the autonomy of each must be pre served even while they are being simultaneously assimilated or in tegrated."42 This stereoscopic vision of a metaphor, according to Berggren, becomes the most fundamental root-metaphor of meta physics. While a rhetorically used metaphor may introduce a novel expression, its metaphysical usage provides a new insight to the relationship, not only by creating a new interpretation of such a</page><page sequence="10">30 J LH/Metaphors of Librarianship relationship, but also by synthesizing the old meaning with a new one.43 In this paper, a conceptual metaphor is described as a deliberate juxtaposition of at least two kinds of meanings: one expressing some established concept of reality, the other providing specific interpretation of that concept. Together, the two meanings suggest a new insight into the nature of reality. The juxtaposition can be illustrated in the model shown in figure 2. The juxtaposition between the empirical and fictional concepts of reality with their objective and subjective interpretations may emphasize either the similarities or differences between the con cepts and their interpretations. Each such juxtaposition may pro duce a tension in a person responding to the metaphor, a tension which is created by an apparent contradiction between an initially perceived concept of reality and its novel interpretation. The re sponse to this tension becomes a major impetus for expanding the respondent's knowledge by absorbing a novel relationship in his or her constantly modified knowledge of reality.44 The above model implies two criteria necessary for validating a metaphorical statement: (a) Each conceptual metaphor must re late to some of the relations identified in the model (E-O; E-S; F-O; or F-S), whereby it must represent at least two concepts, one re Concepts of Reality EMPIRICAL (E) FICTIONAL (F) I . .f" ' J SUBJECTIVE I E-S F-S I Interpretations (S) I Insight Insight J of the Concepts I_._I_-_,_-I_ I of Reality OBJECTIVE | E-O F-O | I (O) I Insight I Insight | Figure 2.

III. Conceptual Metaphor in Librarianship A. General Relationships The reality of librarianship is three-dimensional. On a proce dural, empirical level it consists of the bibliographically organized communication media, each containing a body of categorized knowledge-carriers, such as books, films, tapes, and so on, avail able to library users. On a contextual level, the reality is consid ered in terms of the content of knowledge, in which the meaning contained in the carriers of knowledge is interpreted within a specific context of that knowledge, as, for example, different in terpretations of any philosophical treatise. On a conceptual level, library reality is based on a differentiation between the static (giv en) and dynamic (novel) aspects of knowledge, dramatically illus trated by the ever present idea of conceptual obsolescence. The empirical reality of librarianship is expressed in library op erations; the contextual, sociological reality refers to the subject content of a library collection; while the conceptual, philosophical reality defines the nature of the library's basic function as a dis seminator of acquired and organized knowledge.45 Each of these levels of reality requires a stereoscopic approach, which is essential for grasping the insight of the relationship within each level, simul taneously interrelating it with the other two levels. Hence, a three dimensional, metaphorical reality of librarianship is suggested. The central hypothesis of this essay is developed within the conceptual level of the library reality. That is, for the purpose of this discourse, librarianship is considered in terms of a constantly changing, metaphorical relationship between given and newly per ceived dimensions of knowledge. A universally accepted library responsibility for the dissemina tion of knowledge is met by two basic library functions: (1) to assist the users in discovering concepts which are new to them, and (2) to provide necessary resources for expanding the users' un derstanding of the concepts they have already discovered. Each of the above functions aims at providing an environment for new insights into reality; not by a direct, instructional teach</page><page sequence="12">32 J L HI Me tap h ors of L ibraria nsh ip ing, but by offering the resources for the users' own, independent search for analogies between the concepts and their expressions. The library approach is informal, individualized and library-user oriented. The main goal of library science as a discipline is not to make contributions to the direct expansion of knowledge per se, but to provide facilities for knowledge's promulgation by meeting the need for the knowledge rather than by creating it. Knowledge in this paper is conceived as a continuous expansion of known relations about everything around and within us. This learning process about the all-inclusive universe is developed, ac cording to Urban,46 in at least three basic, primarily linguistic, stages. (1) Knowledge by acquaintance, which is a mere awareness of something, expressed by words which are interpreted as syno nyms of the objects they name. (2) The awareness is then described symbolically. The words are separated from the thing they name, and the knowledge becomes an expression of a concept as an anal ogy between a thing one is aware of and its description in terms of words that are familiar from previous experiences. In this stage, called by Urban a metaphorical stage, a descriptive relationship is established. (3) The third stage is an interpretation of the aware ness. The specific descriptive relationship is abstracted by relating it to a group of similar previous experiences. This is a stereoscopic stage of knowledge, in which the bounding relationship is that of a shared, similar meaning, expressed in a conceptual metaphor. It therefore follows that knowledge, considered here metaphys ically, is a nonphysical entity. Its essence is the relationship be tween various aspects of reality, while its substance is a linguistic structure, analyzed conceptually. This metaphysical approach to knowledge seems to be especial ly appropriate to eclectic disciplines, such as library science. The subject matter of library activities is a reflection of the state of the aggregate of knowledge at any given moment. It changes with the changing directions of knowledge, and it grows by paralleling the growth of knowledge itself. Librarianship disseminates knowledge in all its forms; hence all dimensions encompassed by the global concept of knowledge constitute the essence of librarianship as a scholarly discipline. Since knowledge itself is a dynamic, never-ending process, its dissemination is a never fulfilled goal of librarianship. We will nev er have a complete, definitive library collection, that would cover all aspects of knowledge of the past and present, as long as there is a potential for future knowledge. The scope of a library collection</page><page sequence="13">33 is, therefore, defined not only in terms of physical volumes it has, but also in terms of the new ideas it fosters. Furthermore, since in a dynamic, ever-changing body of knowl edge, there are no absolute true-false or right-wrong dichotomies, librarianship rests on a relativistic credo expressed in a concept of a censorfree library collection, which is selected in terms of the anticipated knowledge-needs of its potential users, and which is accessible to anyone in need of that knowledge. The conceptual metaphor accommodates the dynamism and relativism of both the knowledge and its major disseminator, the library. Metaphysics?to quote with Wright a commonly accepted def inition?"is the philosophical attempt to understand the ultimate realities of this world."47 It exists "whenever we use symbols with transcendent reference; that is to say, when we are not simply con cerned with the patterns of our symbols . . . but ask whether they can be referred to 'things' which transcend symbolic forms."48 It is an intellectual search for a pattern in the nature of the relation ship between a thing, a concept or an experience, and its context. Thus, metaphysics provides a philosophical rationale for develop ing a perspective on the world around us. It is suggested in this paper that the metaphysical substance of librarianship is a metaphorical relationship between the concept expressed in any given medium and its perception by the medium's interpreter, the user of the library. This metaphorical relationship may refer to informing, or in Wright's words to "creating form" in the person receiving information; or it may be found in explaining causal relations or descriptive connections.49 The metaphysical relationship is perceived differently by each individual, while the understanding of that relationship is to a great extent determined by the context in which it is perceived, that is, in a conceptual-metaphysical, concrete-contextual, or logical-pro cedural framework. Hence, the reality of librarianship is metaphysical. It is indirect ly described by the metaphorical language of library theory, which expresses a conceptual system of basic relationships between the library's physical collection, the knowledge-content of that collec tion, and the needs of library users. The general concept of communication as used in librarianship has at least two metaphorical characteristics: (1) the communica tion is instrumental in creating new meaning by introducing novel ty into the content of the communicated message, and (2) it is a process by which any meaning is transferred from one medium to</page><page sequence="14">34 J LH/Metaphors of Librarianship another. Therefore, the essence of communication in library sci ence is the ability of a language to relate various experiences in terms of a meaningful relationship between them. This transfer of meaning is possible by detaching "a word from a particular object and us[ing] it meaningfully for another object."50 As already pointed out, this is "the essence of metaphor . . . carrying over a word as an expressive sign for one object to another object."51 The metaphorical use of language as related to librarianship fa cilitates bridging different conceptual approaches which reflect vari ations in the library's main goals. It also suggests a root-metaphor for librarianship. The bridging aspect of the metaphorical language within librar ianship involves bringing together a variety of discourses within the field. This process follows the basic method of relating an un known, or less known, experience of one person, to a known, or better known, experience of another. Hence, a metaphor always has two references: to a more primitive initial, and to a more de veloped new meaning.52 This is the essence of the method by which knowledge is dis seminated in libraries. It starts with the expression of knowledge as created symbolically by the communicator in a given medium of communication, received by the recipient of that communica tion, and absorbed in his or her own mind. The process is meta phorical and creative; it develops a new meaning by bringing a new relationship between previously unrelated concepts. The application of this disseminating method is clearly evident in scientific methodology. In empirical sciences, for example, new concepts are introduced by developing theoretical models. The models are forms of conceptual metaphors, based on isomorphisms or relational similarities between the model itself, and the system it models. And again, "the theoretical model exploits some other system (such as a mechanism or a familiar mathematical or empir ical theory from another domain) that is already well known and understood in order to explain the less well-established system under investigation."53 The metaphorical relationship between theoretical premises and experimental findings is important in a scientific theory. The meta phorical meaning in such theories integrates the theoretical abstrac tion with empirical findings, without negating the importance of either of them. "In short, the better or more generally explanatory a theory is, the more extensively metaphorical it has become."54 There is no reason why librarianship as a scientific discipline can not build its own theory, based on similar, metaphorical models.</page><page sequence="15">35 B. The Conceptual Root-Metaphor in Library Science In general, a conceptual metaphor used as a model "can have a theoretical function of serving as theory-surrogates?not in the sense of replacing a theory already achieved, but of holding the place for a theory to come."55 This is a sense in which the library science metaphorical model is here proposed (figure 3). It is a theory-sketch, indicating direc tions for further inquiries, suggesting a new approach to already known relations and thus sharpening the scope, definition, and different concepts of library science. The model attempts to bring together various aspects of librar ianship in a coherent, logically related system, and to provide a framework for answering three basic philosophical questions: (1) What is library science? (2) How is it explained? and (3) How can the proposed model of library science be justified? The model identifies both the internal relationships among the primary elements of library science (CO-ME-R, referred to in the model as COMER), and the interpretation of these relationships (A-D-I) which are external to the discipline. The model is fash ioned after the metaphors developed by Urban, in his theory of language and symbolism.56 The primary components of library science?the concept (CO), its meaning (ME), and the response to it by its interpreter (R)?are elaborations of terms identified in my earlier essay, "Reflection on the Nature and Limits of Library Science"57?Book-User-Knowl edge (B-U-K). A concept, as formulated in the mind of its creator, is a starting point for originating new concepts. It is an idea expressing some aspects of the physical as well as the nonmaterial reality. For con venience, concepts may be considered in the context of the disci plines to which they refer, such as specialized concepts in science, art, music, literature, or library science. Each such interpretation of concepts is also subject to the internal idiosyncrasies of its own discipline. The meaningness of the concept (ME) is expressed as a message formulated in one of the communication media, such as a book, a painting, a film, or a sound recording. Its meaning, however, is metaphysical, since it bridges the intent of the originator's ideas (CO), with the interpretation of the message in the medium (ME) by its receiver (R). A response to the original concept may be in the form of a be havioral reaction of an individual (for example, reader of the book,</page><page sequence="16">36 Jin/Metaphors of Librarianship A #/co_ ME\% ? / \ Relations / \ ? / \ (COMER) / \ / R \ / Communicative Discourse (ADI) \ D L-?-^ I insight Figure 3.

The response may at the same time initiate new con cepts, as a part of a chain of concept-response sequences in the development of knowledge. The triangular relationships of COMER point to their basic in terdependence. Thus, for example, the artist's concept is influenced by the medium in which the concept will be expressed, and its meaning will vary with the interpretation made by the viewer of the work. The meaning of the COMER relationship is also directly affected by the level of communicative discourse (ADI): starting with intu itive awareness of the COMER relationship at the level of aquain tance (A), further elaborated by the metaphoric and subjective interpretation of the meaning of COMER at the descriptive level (D), and culminating in the form of a symbolic re-presentation of the COMER relationship at the informative level of the discourse (I). The most general and external is the extrinsic description of the relationship (D-A), followed by an intrinsic appreciation of the re lationship (A-I), reaching the climax in the most intrinsic grasp of the insight of the meaning (D-I). The COMER model suggests its own metaphysical answers to the basic philosophical questions formulated at the beginning of this section. (1) It defines library science as a metaphysical inquiry into the meaning of the discipline of librarianship. In this sense, library sci ence is a study of a unique relationship as it is expressed in the model by COMER's interdependence within a communicative dis course. (2) It provides a philosophical explanation of library science as a domain of epistemological study of differences between various relationships within COMER, as they are revealed in a metaphor ical approach. This explanation is formulated in the languages of specific dis ciplines. Thus, scientific inquiry may ask why some of the relation ships suggested by the COMER model do exist. In a sociological approach, on the other hand, one may ask what is the meaning of the COMER relationship in a societal context, while a psychologi cal investigation may concentrate on the same question, but ana lyze it within an individual's own personal human context. (3) It suggests a justification of library science as a discipline in terms of an axiological, value-oriented inquiry. Together with other</page><page sequence="18">38 J LH/Metaphors of Librarianship disciplines, librarianship is evaluated in terms of its service to the society. Its overall aim is to maximize the availability of knowl edge to individuals, and through them, to social groups, thus imply ing an ideal interdisciplinary and cross-cultural language of com munication, which will offer an insight to the meaning of the com municated message, free of restraints of any kind. Library science can be justified if it can communicate universal ly, at different levels, on different issues, seen from different view points. The metaphorical method offers that flexibility; it also offers an unrestricted insight to the meaning of words that are communicated, reflecting variations in cultural and personal needs of individual library users.

SUMMARY: A Metaphorical Hypothesis of Librarianship Restated A metaphysical interpretation of the philosophy of librarianship suggests that its raison d'etre is a communication process involving the concepts, the vehicles carrying the conceptual messages, and their receptors. The essence of communication processes in librarianship is to provide an insight into the above symbolic relationships. This is a metaphorical approach. If this approach is accepted, the impact of the metaphor on li brarianship can be detected in the following ways in the philosophy of librarianship: ? It provides a root-metaphor which explains the essential meta physical nature of librarianship, that is, as a never-ending pro cess of expanding knowledge by relating less-known to more familiar experiences. ? As a method in axiology, library science is interpreted meta phorically as a discipline, which is neutral and uncommitted to any particular viewpoint. ? Ethical relativism of a metaphorical approach reinforces the li brary commitment to intellectual freedom. ? Epistemologically, a metaphorical model implies an open-ended theory of knowledge. ? Esthetically, the model offers an ordered, logically consistent, balanced theory. ? Professionally, it provides for a system which is hospitable to any personal, as well as institutional, viewpoint. The metaphor itself, and its elucidation in this essay, must of course be interpreted metaphorically. The model and all its com ponent parts and relations are conceptual metaphors. The essay</page><page sequence="19">39 does not resolve the ambiguity of past philosophical discourses in librarianship; it perhaps just confirms its basic nature. The uncertainty of the intent of a message, or of the meaning that a message communicates to different people, constitutes one of the basic metaphysical issues of reality, not only in library sci ence, but also in life in general. Knowledge is not a god-given, a priori collection of wisdom, waiting to be deciphered, but a human interpreted series of constantly created or discovered novel rela tions, each giving us either broader or deeper understanding of reality. With any new insight into a conceptual relationship, knowledge is upwinding in the helical fashion of a spiral, giving us at each ana lytical turn different glimpses of a shifty and kaleidoscopic reality. If, in reading this exposition, readers have expanded their in sight into the concept of librarianship, either by reinforcing or rejecting the hypothesis of this paper, they have acquired a novel view of the enigma of library science, and the metaphor of this essay has fulfilled its purpose.

Following the distinction between form and matter, Wright introduced the concept of the "telus-mechus interface," the know-what (telus) and the know-how (mechus), raising the question whether librarians should be classified as humanistic idealists (telus-type) or materialistic scientists (mechus type). 11.

Terms such as "artificial intelligence," "assembler," "card reader," "in terpreter," "supervisor," are just a few examples of anthropomorphic meta phors used in computer science. The following quotation from the Running Press Glossary of Computer Terms by John Prenis (Philadelphia: Running Press, 1977) exemplifies a metaphorical misinterpretation, or at least an ex aggeration, of the human-computer analogy: "Handshaking. When a machine transmits data to another machine, it usually ends each transmission with a signal that means 'Did you get that O.K.?' And the other machine answers with a signal that means 'Yes I did, what's next?' or 'How's that again?' This continual exchange is called 'handshaking'" (p. 37). 30. Stephen C.
