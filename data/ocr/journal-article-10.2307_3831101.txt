University of Chicago Press, 1970. 202 + xiv pp. $7.95. Reviewed by DAVID S. BARBER, University of Idaho Concentrating on Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres and The Education of Henry Adams, John Conder sets out to show how Adams's literary inten- tions and strategies relate to his scientific, historicalt and didactic motives. Conder emphasizes Adams/s desire to express historical theories through his art. In this regard A Formula of His Own differs from another recent study on Adams's literary artr Vern Wagner's The Suspension of Henry Adams: A Shidy of Manner and Matter (Wayne State, 1969) Wagner dis- cusses Adams as a "humorist" who held himself suspended between opposing beliefs, committing himself to no theories or standards, and striving after no final position-except that of good temper. In Conder's perspective Chartres and the Education form a unit designed to support Adams's historical theory on the deterioration of medieval unity into the chaos of our own time and thought. At the same time Conder insists that each book has its own unique artistry, which must be discussed in rela- tion to Adams's intellectual purposes. Despite some straining after dubious relationships in the form and content of Adams's two great works, Conder's study helps significantly to define the dimensions of Adams's artistry and clarify his extraliterary motives. Conder discusses literary techniques (e.g., role of narrator, telescoping of time) in order to make various connections showing that Chartres and the Education comprise one unit (each of whose parts is unified in itself). One central parallel in each work, for example, is that between the per- sonal world of the narrator Mwho is the same in both books and the movement of history. Such connections indicate how the Chartres-Educa- tion unit explains the movement from medieval to modern times. Conder's contribution is his analysis of how Adams expresses his theory, which (broadly stated) is that the American Civil War is "the failure of the medieval synthesis itself . . the breakup of the Transition!" 707</page><page sequence="2">H EN RY ADAMS But how should we respond to such a thesis? VVhen historical ideas appear in a work of art, what status- for Adams and the reader- do they have in the world outside art? Conder asserts that Adams meant his ideas to be taken not as science or history but as art, whose certainty is that of the individual's personal experience, his sense impressions. One can- not get through to reality, which science has shown to be supersensual and unknowable. Still, Conder argues, Adams hoped that his works might lead to true science or history, and "one of the conditions of his art was that it create a theory, no matter how tentative, transcending art, capable of being tested in the outside world." But if, as Conder main- tains, Adams held that one can know only sense data, then art is the only human reality and there is no distinction between artist and scientific historian (except in artistry). Then Conder/s conclusion "It is as art that we must view the version of history affirmed by the inseparable unit: Mont-Saint-/91ichel and Chartres and The Education of Henry Adams" loses force. If we accept Adams's view, then all versions of history are art. If we deny Adams's view while accepting Conder's conclusion, then we are in darlger of not examining Adams's version of history seriously, even as a metaphor of historical reality. Conder sometimes stretches too far for his connections, as when he asserts that in focusing on Constantine's Edict of Milan (Education, Chap- ter 33) Adams "establishes an implicit analogy with the movement of the Education through the Civil War years." But generally his reasoning is persuasive, and his book is filled with useful analyses. Conder is enlight- ening when discussing, for example, how Adams's changing attitudes toward determinism affected the form of many of his works, or demon- strating how the Education tests eighteenth-century assumptions and finds them wanting, or analyzing any of the literary strategies he finds in Char- tres and the Eciucation. But what matters most is the thesis of a Chartres- Education unit in which Adams tried to mold all his major ideas on man, science, and history into a single work of art. Lyon, Melvin. SYMBOL AND IDEA IN HENRY ADAMS. University of Nebraska Press, 1970. 326 pp. $9.75. Reviewed by RONALD MELDRUM, Washington State University This is a seminal work which offers a distillation of previous scholarship as well as fresh insight. In the Introduction Lyon notes the importance for Adams of first abstracting facts and feelings, then embodying "his ideas in some more or less specific program for improving society." Lyon says that for Adams (echoing Thuycydides' concept of the importance of studying history) history is to be thought of "as the totality of past human experience . . . and thus a means of gaining perspective upon the present." Lyon outlines the growth of Adams's view of history and life from the outset of his career when he tended to apply the objective scientific method, through his later works when he tended to utilize an intuitive and subjective approach to his subject matter. "Yet," says Lyon, 708</page><page sequence="3">"subjectivism still remains under the control of intellectualism and didac- tic moralism, and a historical context is used to give greater veracity and conviction to the contemporary testing of ideas." Lyon lists nine aspects of the sensibility expressed in Adams's works, then proceeds to discuss them in the course of his treatise; critical note 1 explains in part the sources of these aspects of the sensibility. (Lyon notes that "humor" is an additional aspect he might have added to his list.) Chapter One is devoted to an analysis of Adams's biography of Henry Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury under Jefferson and Madison. He traces the significance for Adams of the various decisions made by Gallatin and notes Adams's final view that primarily through the use of empirical rea- son one is led to a knowledge of reality. Chapter Two is a discussion of Democracy: An American Novel. In it Lyon says Adams "examines the doctrine that American government is morally superior to other govern- ments." Adams, says Lyon, concludes this is an illusion. Chapter Three is a study of the acceptance by Adams of nature as the ultimate authority. In Esther: A Novel Adams "affirms an optimism toward nature's ruling authority and therefore toward at least the immediate future of man which distinguishes it from all Adams's work after Gallatin." Chapter Four continues the discussion of Adams's examination of American ideals. Chapters Five and Six reflect a shift in the focus on America and its prob- lems to Adams's quest for "final answers to the problems of illusion and reality." Lyon examines Adams's statements on these problems as set forth in Mont-Saint-Michel ancl Chartres and The Education of Henry Adams and provides the reader with good resumes of both in addition to provocative insights. He concludes, rightfully in my opinion, that Adams's answer to the question of the ultimate nature of reality is pre- sented in The Education. In the introduction to Symbol and Idea, Lyon says, "Of all Adams's works, The Education most fully fuses the eight or nine aspects of his sensibility and thus represents its fullest fruition." Chapters Seven and Eight, on "The Ultimate Symbols," furnish useful dis- tinctions for those interested in the history of ideas approach to the works of Henry Adams; much has already been written on the significance of the symbols in Adams's work and these chapters present a cogent sum- mation of the principal scholarly works on the matter. Symbol and Idea in Henry Adams is a model of scholarly excellence; it is well-conceived, well-executed and thoroughly documented. In addi- tion to its excellent text, Symbol and Idea offers the serious Adams scholar useful bibliographic aids: the appendices contain much informa- tion, the critical notes make excellent reading in themselves, and the bibliography will prove immensely useful to those wishing to explore the labyrinths of scholarship on Henry Adams. Wagner, Vern. THE SUSPENSION OF HENRY ADAMS: A STUDY OF MANNER AND MATTER. Wayne State University Press, 1969. 268 pp. $8.95. Reviewed by HENRY B. RULE, Lamar State College It has been several decades since Robert E. Spiller wrote in an article in The Saturday Review of Literature (February 27, 1947) that it was high time for a literary treatment of Henry Adams's work. Spiller complained 709</page><page sequence="4">H EN RY ADAMS that Adams had been in the hands of social and historical critics long enough, and he found it mysterious that his countrymen had waited so long to recognize Adams as one of their "all too few master artists." Since then, at least thirteen major books about Adams have been pro- duced, some of them of excellent quality. Many of them are general books about Adams's life, thought, and art. Others are more specialized, concerned with his literary antecedents, his relationship to his contempo- raries, his scientific background, and the facts of his life and time. Although the trend has been increasingly to treat Adams as a literary figure, and some of these books contain rich interpretative passages, still no single volume until the present time has subjected Adams's art to the kind of rigorous critical examination that, for example, his contem- porary Henry Sames has received many times. Hence Spiller's call in 1947 for critics to consider Henry Adams as one of America's "all too few master artists" has not yet been completely answered. Vern Wagner's recently published book The Suspension of Henry Adams: A Study of Manner and Matter endeavors to satisfy to some extent the need for a full and close analysis of Adams's literary techniques. The object of this book is to show the union of manner and matter in four of Adams's major works: History of the United States, Mont-Saint-Michel and Char- tres, The Education of Henry Adams, and the two closely related essays "The Rule of Phase Applied to History" and "A Letter to American Teach- ers of History." According to Wagner, the stylistic elements in the History -the use of balanced sentences, hyperbole, understatement, and wit- emphasize that "history is conflict, confusion and ignorance." The ex- aggerations and qualifications in the style of Chartres illustrate Adams's refusal to take sides in the conflicts between divine unity and free will, mercy and justice, law and anarchy that form the content of the book. The wit, mockery, hyperbole, understatement, similes, circumlocutions, sentence structure, paragraph organization, and structure of the Education as a wholy-all reveal Adams's uncertainty as to the meaning of his life and times. Finally, the "cloudiness and muddiness of expression and organ- ization" of the "Rule" and the "Letter" were designed to illustrate the confusion in the state of science at the turn of the century. In short, matter and manner unite, according to Wagner, to produce a sense of paradox, conflict, and uncertainty. This creation of confusion was conscious and deliberate, according to Wagner; it was not the result of confusion in Adams's mind, as Yvor Winters contended in his famous essay "Henry Adams; or the Creation of Confusion" (1943). It was, Wagner says, the result of Adams's conviction that in a world of chaos where the truth is unknowable the author should present all sides of an issue as powerfully as possible while he himself maintains a posture of "suspen- sion" that refuses to arrive at firm conclusions. This attitude of suspension among conflicting positions while fixing on none Wagner calls "humor." In all of his major works, we are told, Adams hovered about a series of dilemmas while refusing to embrace any of the horns thereof faith and reason, law and chaos, elevation and degradation, and so on. Hence Adams was "a humorist par excellence." Although Wagner's book discovers some interesting and useful patterns in the style and content of Adams's writings, it has some serious failings. 710</page><page sequence="5">He exhibits the scholar's disease of riding his theories to exhaustive lengths. His almost chapter by chapter analysis of the Education appears at times to be mere resume rather than meaningful analysis. Everywhere there is conflict he sees "suspension" and therefore "humor." Even the beautiful statue by August St. Gaudens erected over the grave of Marian Adams is seen as "brooding suspension." Surely it is a distortion to say that Bil/y Budd is a work of humor because it "reveals the irreconcilable conflicts between Billy and Captain Vere and Claggart and does not re- solve them." Such are the quirky results when the scholar clings too single-mindedly to his theories. More serious, Wagner's theoretical blinders leave the impression that the hero of his book, Henry Adams, was extremely narrow and eccentric as an artist and thinker. It is hard to see how one can read through Adams's works and arrive at the conclusion that they represent nothing more than a sterile nose thumbing at the possibility of truth, a joke with- out meaning except that there is no meaning. When Adams wrote in a letter while in the midst of his labors on the History that he was "writing for a continent of a hundred million people fifty years hence," he certainly didn't mean that he was leaving as his main legacy to posterity the empty conclusion that history was unknowable. Among other things, the History was designed to impress upon its readers the lesson of what Adams called "practical statesmanship," which he defined as "a mere struggle to deal with concrete facts at the cost of philosophic and a priori prin- ciple" a lesson which can be applied to critics as well as to statesmen. Furthermore, Chartres is clearly more than a balancing act on the part of Adams between the love of the Virgin and the logic of Thomas Aquinas. His yearning for the divine love of the Virgin and his rejection of the all too human logic of St. Thomas seem too obvious for demonstration. Lastly, the Education, the "Letter," and the "Rule" were not mere exer- cises in futility, ab Wagner implies. The long and brilliant criticism of the failures of man's intellect, which is the controlling theme of all of Adams's major works, was intended not to demolish man's intellect but to urge the need for more flexible and intense mental powers that must be achieved in order for man to adapt to and govern the new forces un- leashed by science and technology. Professor Wagner presents his thesis of "suspension" as "less than tentative." Nevertheless, his approach to Adams's matter and manner is too restricted and literal. The fact is that the passionately moral Henry Adams, rather than remaining in "suspension," always took sides, and that is partly why he is one of the great prophets in the history of Ameri- can thought. What is still needed is a comprehensive study of those rich and mysterious techniques of indirection and camouflage that make him also in Spiller's words one of our "all too few master artists."

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1968. 244 pp. $5.95. Seib, Kenneth. JAMES AGEE: PROMISE AND FULFILLMENT. University of Pitts- burgh Press, 1969.174 pp. $2.50. Reviewed by WESLEY KORT, Duke University Focusing the camera on James Agee's work is the problem. One way of solving it is to zero in on one part, discounting the rest as experimenta- tion or prostitution. A second way is to look past the work to the man, a person all of us would like to have had as a friend. Diversity creates the problem, one aggravated by Agee's ability to do a number of things well. I feel that his various achievements call for a group shot, one with - each member standing separately, looking, to use Agee's words from "The House," "directly into the camera as into the face of a Rabble and as into the perfectly cold eye of fate and their own knowledge of it." Kenneth Seib and Professor Fitzgerald have chosen, instead, to simplify the picture, the one by elevating the fiction and the second by emphasiz- ing the man behind the work. After a somewhat psychoanalytic beginning, Kenneth Seib presents Agee's career as a search for and rejection of forms. The question is whether Agee clearly moved from one form to another. His attention to the film runs from deep in his youth, and he did not abandon his youth- ful poetic interests. Seib quotes Agee's comment to Father Flye that "poetry is the product of adolescence or of an emotionally adolescent frame of mind and that as this state of mind changes, poetry is likely to dry up." But Agee goes on in that letter to say, "I think most people let it; and that the one chance is to keep fighting and trying as hard as possible [not to let it dry up]." Later Seib contends that the film "was merely one more commercial venture into which he decided to throw his artistic talents." But Agee's interests in film are probably as deepiv rooted in his youth as his poetic work. Fortunately, Seib does not push his thesis very hard, and he balances it with appreciative and often help- ful comments on Agee's work in the various forms. When he deals with Agee's fiction, Seib is the most enthusiastic about his subject, and he makes a sharp distinction between the fiction and the other work, between Let Us Now Praise Famous Men and A Death in the Fami/y. He feels, in fact, that Agee rejected the manner of the earlier form. However, in the two books, despite their great differences, Agee's position, that of mediator and witness, is constant. It is not clear that the theory, as Seib puts it, "that every part of Nature contains absolute beauty," is abandoned before the final book. Agee did not feel, as Seib seems to, a contradiction between beauty of this kind and careful, artful, or, what Agee liked to call, "scientific" writing. As he put it in "A Way of Seeing," "The artist's task is not to alter the world as the eye sees it into a world of aesthetic reality but to perceive the aesthetic reality within the actual world, and to make an undisturbed and faithful record of the instant in which this movement of creativeness achieves its most expres- sive crystallization." Reality for Agee in both books is reality as seen. Professor Fitzgerald's collection from the prose of Agee is rather per- 712</page><page sequence="7">sonal. A quarter of the book is a memoir written primarily out of Fitz- gerald's experiences as Agee's friend and associate. Although not a de- fense of Agee, the memoir counters some common notions of his life and manners. Fitzgerald makes it clear that Agee could also be a gen- erous, selfless man. Further, he feels that Agee's move to films was a natural one, for Agee "loved movies," says Fitzgerald, "more than any- one I ever knew; he also lived them and thought them." And a most common understanding, namely that Agee's efforts in journalism were only a burden to him and a waste of his talent, Fitzgerald checks with the opinion that often his work was "able to dignify the reporting of events." The prose for which we are prepared by this memoir consists of two stories from Harvard days, two satiric pieces, four updated frag- ments, "Plans for Work" from Agee's second vain application for a Gug- genheim Fellowship, two scripts for movies, that version of the Broklyn piece which he wrote for Fortuneo and " A Mother's Tale." The intention is not to have collected ali of the short prose but to have indicated the various forms. Some readers may feel that more or other things should have been included. Reading these pieces reveals again how often Agee was obsessed by the gaps and transitions between living contraries, silence and the word, subjectivity and objectivity, death and life, the ordinary and the cere- monial, guilt and forgiveness, fear and peace of mind. The speakers in his prose stand often in the role of mediator between such contraries. But especially the speakers mediate between the object faithfully to be rendered and the reader. Repeatedly the speaker stands as The One Who Came Back, the faithful witness, and not only to horror and fear as in "The Mother's Tale," but to beauty and love as well. At one point Fitzgerald says that Let (Js Now Praise FamotJs Men "is the center piece in the life and writing of my friend." The reason may be that the role of mediator on that occasion was the most demanding. Silence is, consequentJy, the ground of the work, as silence repeatedly appears as a word or as a theme in Agee's writingt silence with darkness and mothers and children and poor or oppressed people, in short with what in life and society is unformed, mysterious, unacceptable, and prior to or beyond speech and categories. Silence requires withdrawal, and, after withdrawal, a fresh beginning, an attempt at an honest word, can be made. Agee's fascination in this book for what lies under or prior to lingual and social forms is present in his other work as well, but I would like to close with a parting shot of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. It uncovers the ground and the products of American society: exploitation, slavery and poverty. Agee's call is to withdrawal, then to seeing objects as subjects, then to speaking truthfully, and finally to the breaking of chains. His book had to wait twenty years for our nation to raise up an audience worthy of it. It may have to wait another generation for its call to be answered. C Barson, Alfred Turner.

EDWARD ALBEE: PLAYWRIGhIT IN PROTEST. New York: Drama Book Specialists, 1969. 280 pp. $6.95. Reviewed by ANTHONY HILFER, University of Texas at Austin Richard E. Amacher's Edward Albee is the kind of book that has earned Twayne the distrust of the scholarly community. The several Twayne series have had their successes: Edwin Cadyts Stephen Crane and Shel- 714</page><page sequence="9">don Grebstein's Sinclair Lewis, for example, are excellent critical studies. Even the average Twayne book serves the function of providing an intro- duction and a bibliographical guide to its subject. Unfortunately Amacher's Afbee lacks even the minimal virtues of a Twayne book. Amacher's Introduction promises "a combination of explication de texte and Aristotelian part-whole analysis." In practice, Mr. Amacher's explication de texte is merely lengthy plot summary pieced out with an occasional obvious comment (we learn that Albee is interested in the problem of illusion and reality). It is difficult to envision a reader of a critical book on Albee who is not familiar with at least The American Dream, but Amacher's chapter on it consists only of a list of what he supposes to be the major themes ("1. the importance of distinctive dress at any cost") followed by an exhausting plot summary relieved by no critical comment whatever. There can only be a quantitative rea- son for devoting nine pages to Albee's mediocre adaptation of blalcolm and on Iy seven to American Dream: Malcolm takes longer to para- phrase. Amacher does attempt an Aristotelian analysis of some of the plays, pointing out that The Zoo Story ends in a recognition scene. But only in his chapter on Tiny Alice does Amacher show the slightest awareness of the complications that result when a dramatist transforms Aristotelian construction by a strong admixture of Artaud. Tiny Alice, indeed, is the one play which Amacher ventures to interpret, and his chapter on it is the one thing of value in his book. One can only further characterize the book by a series of negatives: there is no attempt to trace Albee's sources and traditions; there is no analysis of his style and technique; and there are no critical appraisals of the relative value of his plays except in a few ex cathedra generalizations in the last chapter: "Other critics . . . misstated the theme [of The Sand- box], overstressing the importance of dialogue and neglecting the action while making misleading or caviling remarks about characterization." How could one overstress the importance of dialogue in an Albee play? The book has a biographical sketch of Albee which adds nothing new to our meagre information about him, a bibliography of his plays and articles, and a selective bibliography of books with sections about him. The annotated bibliography of articlei usually included in Twayne books is lacking in this one. In contrast to Amacher, Rutenberg is willing to risk and to argue critical judgments. He convincingly specifies the weaknesses of Ma/colm and The Death of Bessie Smith. Disagreeing with the dominant critical judgments of Tiny Alice, A Delicate Balance and Box-Mao-Box, he conducts a vigor- ous defense of them. Analyzing Box in terms of McLuhan's media philos- ophy and Richard Kostelanetz's media criticism, Rutenberg justifies the apparent incoherence of the play by explaining that it is an aural, poly- phonic form demanding "pattern recognition" and resisting the habit of lineart sequential reasoning with which the unMcLuhanized playgoer approaches drama. The bookt covering Albee's plays from The Zoo Story to Box-Mao-Box, concludes with two informative interviews between Rutenberg and Albee. There is also a selective bibliography of criticism abouXt Albee. 715</page><page sequence="10">Though a far more useful study than Amacher's, there is a defect in Rutenberg's approach. The book's title and first chapter emphasize the thesis that Albee writes "reformist plays of social protest" and thus differs from the more despairing, more metaphysical "theater of the absurd." Rutenberg quotes Albee's statement that "the responsibility of the writer is to be a sort of demonic social critic" but Albee has also publicly iden- tified himself with the theatre of the absurd. Moreover, absurdist drama, such as in lonesco or Genet, is not without an element of social criticism. It might also be questioned whether Rutenberg has given full weight to Albee's qualifier that he is a demonic social critic. It may be true that Albee "speaks to those who have stood up to the huge, previously unshakeable urban boards of education" but it is diffi- cult to see the relevance of this to critical understanding of his plays. If Albee is a social critic, it is more in the manner of Tennessee Williams than of Arthur Miller. He is interested not in specific social issues, but in the character distortions that a diseased society produces. The Death of Bessie Smith may seem the one play by Albee that fits into Rutenberg's thesis. Yet Rutenberg approvingly quotes Henry Goodman's correct contention that Bessie Smith is a "fierce 'battle of the sexes' outwardly resembling a play of social protest." Rutenberg is most perceptive when he ignores his untenable thesis, whereas in the pursuit of it he is led into some oddly banal interpretations, as in his commentary on Peter's parakeets in The Zoo Story: "His girls both have their own parakeets a tribute to his misapplication of modern child psychology which states that parents ought to treat all the children equally, lest 'sibling rivalry' appear. It oc- curs neither to Peter nor to his wife that one family parakeet can be enjoyed by both children." Surely Albee's point is Peter's timid submis- sion to a female-dominated household, symbolized by its cats and para- keets, rather than the necessity for a communal parakeet. And Rutenberg would understand Jerry better if he interpreted him less as a pathetic social outcast and more in the tradition of the anti-hero of black comedy, the seemingly shameless and affrontingly honest specialist in humiliation and degradation whose literary ancestry goes as far back as Diderot's Rameau's Nephew, a book which has a confrontation closely paralleling The Zoo Story. Indeed what we miss in Rutenberg's book almost as much as in Amacher's is an investigation of Albee's literary and cultural sources and a close study of his dramatic technique. Such formal qualities as the Artaudian ritualism which informs the plays and the brilliant use of language and timing, particularly in the wittiness of the dialogue con- struction, better explain the power of Albee's plays than do his rela- tively standard views about social problems. In the Albee interview Rutenberg suggests that the long-winded lady in Box-Mao-Box is a symbol of this country and her fear of falling is indicative of our foreign policy. Albee responds: "People will read signposts into anything because they seem unwilling to suffer an experience on its own terms and let their unconscious come into full play.... This pigeonholing and symbol- hunting is merely an attempt not to suffer the experience the playwright wants the audience to suffer." 716 </page><page sequence="11">C Jansky, Ann Leah Lauf.

HORVATH, Baruch College of City University of New York Professor della Fazia enables the reader to bring the correspondence be- tween Anouilh's theater and metaphysical vision into clear focus. In the main portion of her book we encounter a cinematographic technique. The camera focuses first on a panoramic view of the world events and early experiences that contributed to the formation of Anouilh's vision of the human situation; then, on the themes in his theater that define and reveal that vision; and finally, on the plays themselves as metaphors of that same vision. The latter portion of the book, which is unquestion- ably more original than the first, treats Anouilhts dramatic techniques and the influences exerted by Giraudoux, Pirandello, and the commedia dell'arte on the development of Anouilh's concept of the theater as an art form. 717</page><page sequence="12">As Professor della Fazia's discussion progresses, her camera gradually centers on a world, reminiscent of Giraudoux's, in which man is inescap- ably caught between opposing essences: between what he was in the "past" and what he would like to be in the "present"; between his own '/heroic stance" and the "mediocrity" that surrounds him; between his attachment to the "pure ideals" of youth and the necessity of /'compro- mise" that life entails. Though not explicitly articulated in the book, the author's analyses reveal a direct correlation between Anouilh's evolution as a dramatist and his gradual abandonment of any attempt to seek or offer realistically viable solutions to a human predicament viewed in terms of the afore- mentioned antithetical essences. The evolution, which is characterized by a movement away from a realistic, naturalistic theater of ideas toward a concept of theater as "pure divertissement," is linked to Anouilh's in- creasingly theatrical vision of life as "a stage on which all the men and women are merely players" eternally re-enacting variations of the same essential drama. The various attitudes of Anouilh's heroes toward their "assigned" roles in life provide the key to his evolution as a playwright. Three distinct hero types are discernible in Professor della Fazia's study: those who accept and play their "assigned" roles to the bitter end; those who abandon the conflict and settle for a life of "happy" mediocrity; and those who reject and seek to change the roles "assigned" to them. As the third group gradually finds its way to the center of Anouilh's stage, the influences of Pirandello and the commedia dell'arte, already present at the outset of Anouilh's career, become more and more pro- nounced. Anouilh's stage becomes a metaphor of a world in which the players choose their own roles, a stage on which illusion and reality, theater and life are fused and confused until the dividing line is totally blurred and the spectator is faced with a theater of "pure divertissement," in which the truth is "cosi se vi pare." Ultimately the play (and especially the play [or plays] within the play) offers both actors and spectators a tem- porary release from the human situation. Professor della Fazia's extensive knowledge of both Pirandello and the commedia dell'arte make her final chapter the most interesting. It is here that she considerably expands an aspect of Anouilh criticism that previous critics have little more than introduced. If Professor della Fazia's analyses enable the reader to draw the above conclusions, her own focus is not al- ways clear. Since the author concentrates on the affinities rather than the divergencies between Anouilh and his sources of inspiration, the responsi- bility for determining the originality of his contributions is left largely to the reader. These are perhaps the main shortcomings of a book that both reinforces what other critics have said and expands a heretofore little- developed but important dimension of Anouilh criticism. The presentation is interesting and the style highly readable. E Asp, Carolyn. "Two Views of Tragedy: Sophocles and Anouilh."

THE LATER AUDEN: FROM "NEW YEAR LETTER" TO ABOUT THE HOUSE. Rutgers University Press, 1970. 208 pp. $7.50. Reviewed by C. M. ARMITAGE, University of North Carolina Now Auden enters his mid-sixties, and as the corpus of his work, though still growing, seems to assume a certain shape- at least when viewed from a distance books about him begin to proliferate. And he is so protean a maker that a critic or interpreter can select an area of the corpus for scrutiny with the justification that it needs the kind of con- centrated focus that a general study of ordinary length precludes. Ac- cordingly, Mr. Bahike focuses on the poetry Auden has written since 1940, especially the four long poems of the forties. Wisely, Bahike begins by considering Auden's poetry of the thirties. He announces that his method will involve "a relatively close analysis" of selected poems, but he actually proceeds more by summary than by analysis. Moreover, while he mentions that a given poem was not re- printed in Auden's Collected Poetry (1945), he can discuss "Petition" and spend two pages approving "Spain 1937" without indicating that Auden has dropped them from his canon, the latter with the comment that it contains "wicked doctrine, [and] that I should have stated it simply because it sounded to me rhetorically effective is quite inexcusable" (Auden's "Foreword" to his Collected Shorter Poems 1927-1957J. To these two poems Auden adds "September 1, 1939" as forming a group that he now considers "trash which he is ashamed to have written." Yet Bahike says nothing about Auden's changed attitude to "September 1, 1939," a silence that is the more remarkable because he begins to discuss that poem in the same sentence as that in which he ceases tc) comment on Joseph Warren Beach's attack on Auden's lack of "integrality" in making such changes. Where Bahike stands on this issue is far from clear. From that poem, the discussion glides into a review of the ideas Auden absorbed from Kierkegaard, Tillich, and Charles \0/illiams. The review is mainly based upon Monroe Spears' presentation of this rnaterial in The Poetry of W. H. Auden, as Bahike acknowledges. His quite useful sum- mary of received opinion about "Auden's Christian Thought" is matched 719</page><page sequence="14">W. H. AUDEN by that in a later chapter on "Auden's Literary Criticism." Here Auden is placed "directly in the Hulme-Eliot tradition" of anti-romanticism. Al- though John Blair developed this argument in The Poetic Art of W. H. Auden (1965), he is unmentioned in Bahike's book. I n the central chapters, on Auden's long poems, the proportion of quotation and paraphrase to commentary increases. Nor is the usefulness of the commentary enhanced by the presence of cryptic and un- elaborated references such as that to "the subtle reorganization of reality in twentieth-century literature" (p. 86), or explanations which leave one dangling, like "In another sense the 'Stage Manager' [in "The Sea and the Mirror"] is the artist himself, and there is a synthesis here, accordingly, of tone and meaning" (p. 88). Similarly, arguments like those advanced to justify Caliban's speaking in a Jamesian manner-that James and Auden are both concerned with the problems of art and that the Jamesian style "conveys the complexity of the ideas involved"-are too simplistic. Evaluation of the literary merit of the long poems is very limited. At the end of the chapter on "For the Time Being," for example, no assessment of the final effect of the work is offered: the reader is simply pointed towards the poem it "anticipates," The Age of Anxiety. In the two para- graphs considering the effect of the latter, Bahike introduces a potentially useful point, Auden's using a "mock pastoral" form, only to veer away again behind "in one sense at least the incongruity between form and content is appropriate to a poem examining social behavior." In the final chapter, on the short poems of the last two decades, the importance of the comic is acknowledged, but Justin Replogle's study of this matter (in Auden's Poetry, 1969) offers more penetrating analyses. In sum, while Bahike's call for the needed elucidation of the later poetry has been partially answered by his book, it is unlikely to become established as the definitive study of those complex poems. Fuller, John. A READER'S GUIDE TO W. H. AUDEN. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1970. 280 pp. $6.50. Reviewed by DONALD E. MORSE, Oakland University Critics, scholars and literate readers of Auden's poetry will be grateful for John Fuller's informative, lively and erudite A Reader's Guide to W. H. Auden. The book's premise, although unstated, is clear: the reader must be willing to trust the writer and be prepared to work diligently at understanding and appreciating the poetry. After covering familiar terri- tory quickly and succinctly, Fuller elucidates difficulties, suggests debts and sources, and, occasionally, offers a considered judgment. His Guide is a model for its kind, since in it there is never a voice speaking ex cathedra, but one constantly inviting discussion of Auden's poetry qua poetry. Fuller presents some new, valuable information, yet the usefulness of his book rests not so much on its originality as on its reliability. The influence of what Auden once called "the various kerygmas of Blake, 720 </page><page sequence="15">of Lanef of Freud, of Marx" are admirabiy traced and documented as well as several influences not so well known to the general readert such as Tiddy's The Mummerts Play and the Exeter Book. Conspicuously missing from the list of debtst however, is C. P. Cavafyt the Greek poet whom Auden reports to enjoy reading today and of whom he wrote in 1961: "Cavafy has remained an influence on my own writing; that is to say, I can think of poems which, if Cavafy were unknown to me, I should have written quite differently or perhaps not written at all.tt One of the most important in this group of poems is @'Lay your sleeping head, my love,'t and Fuller's examination of it suffers from its not being compared with similar Cavafy poems. The Guide offers an excellent introduction to the poems and plays of the thirties and a cJear examination of the technique, theme, and artistry of the long poems, except for the @'Letter to Lord Byron" which Fuller inexplicably ignores. Typical of Fuller's perception is his describing the now jettisoned "Notes" to the New Year Letter as "deployed contributive material" similar to that in the Dunciad and unlike the notes tacked on to "The Waste Land." Looking carefully at "For the Time Being,t' he claims- correctly I think that @"The Meditation of Simeon' is a condensed and exhaustive statement of Auden's religious position at the time. . . As such, it is probably more valuable for its ability to illuminate other writings of Auden's than as art in itself; for it is a prime example of that weakening tendency to cold abstraction...." One of the few quarrels 1 have with Fuller occurs during the discussion of 8'For the Time Being" when he echoes Harry Levints early review and criticizes Auden for employing a "quasi-Revivalist refrain,t There's a Way. There's a Voice./t While this refrain may remind a few readers of the revival tent, surely most readers of a Christmas oratorio will recall instead the prominent New Testament metaphor for Christ's relation to the Kingdom of Heaven He is "the way, the truth and the life" (John 14.6). Auden uses this verse again in the Oratorio as the basis for the concluding chorus. But this is minor. Other long poems which receive especially iucidt cogent or fresh readings are The Age of Anxietyo The Orators, and Paid on Both Sides. Another strength of the Guide is its careful treatment of Auden's light verse, which has proven such an embarrassment to critics in these most serious of times. In a concise discussion with helpful glosses on "Under Which Lyre: A Reactionary Tract for the Times" for example, Fuller dem- onstrates Popets proposition that 8a poem on a slight subject requires the greater care to make it considerable enough to be read.t' The Guide's one weak section occurs in the slack treatment of About the House the volume which remainsJ I suspect, the most difficult of Auden's to criticize. Fuller's concluding chapter is a superb discussion of poems omitted from the two collected volumes to which the Guide is keyed, Co/lected Shorter Poems (London &amp; New Yorkr 1966)! and Collected Longer Poems (London &amp; New Yorkt 1968). Perhaps his dispassionate weighing of these rejected pieces will lead Auden to consider their in- clusion in future volumes. Throughout the Guide Fuller amply documents his belief that @@for breadth, wisdom, myth, moral power and sheer technical excitemento he [Auden] is for me the greatest living poet writing in English." To which 721</page><page sequence="16">W. H. AUDEN many of us woulel say "Amen," and be grateful that John Fuller proves such a splendid guide to this Proteus of modern poetry. Nelson, Gerald. CHANGES OF HEART: A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF W. H. AUDEN. University of California Press, 1969. 152 pp. $5.75. Reviewed by JOHN E. STOLL, Belmont College My response to Changes of Heart is like the Oxford don's to pleasure: "I don't feel quite happy about it." This book may have been written for its thesis-the process by which Auden evolves a new and very humble "voice" to obliterate the role of the social activist of the thirties or for the author's seemingly pious affection in describing the "development" so wrought. But it has not been written for both because Nelson's apparent praise of Auden's technical achievement is at variance with his underlying, deprecating view of the poet as one who knows "that he knows nothing" and who has "tried to understand both himself and the world and has given up." To begin with, the early poem, "Petition," is contrasted with "Septem- ber 1, 1939" in order to illustrate Auden's shifting viewpoint, from the persona believing in social progress, self-redemption, and "pride in possibility" to the voice of "humility in failure." "September 1" thus anticipates The Shield of Achilles (and after), where the voice permeates and controls the entire volume, not merely a single poem. The journey between these two points takes us through The Sea and the Mirror, For the Time Being, and The Age of Anxiety, after which Nelson concludes that the "'new' Auden seems to be telling us that all the agonies or hopes of the thirties were mere nonsense" (p. 145), and that beginning with Nones there is a "lack of tension between the poet and his experience" (p. 145). From The Sea and the Mirror we learn that "none of the voices in this poem is Auden's" new persona because they are all, "in varying degrees, false," and that Caliban is "the proponent of the final philosophical position" of the poem. In For the Time Being, however, Auden isolates the components of the voice, the chorus that experiences but does not comment and the Narrator who "comments but does not experience," but he fails to unite them. Before the required fusion can take place, or the didacticism of the early poetry which "demanded that the persona be both pupil and teacher" be overcome, Auden must eliminate "the old persona of the thirties." According to Nelson, Auden accomplishes this task in The Age of Anxiety, largely through Malin, by exorcising the spectre of man's hope in self-redemption and social progress (the old persona), and the new voice (Belief) is free at last to ernerge. In this way the double voice of For the Time Being is surmounted and the way prepared for the pious poems (lacking dramatic tension) of Nones, The Shield of Achi//es, and About the House. Auden's "worries are over"; he can accept life without questioning it or himself, and his change of heart is complete. The flaw in Changes of Heart is the author's treatment of the "new 722</page><page sequence="17">voice" as if it existed in a vacuum, a merely formal accouterment apart from Auden's thematic concerns. It need not be asserted that Nelson misinterprets the later poetry because he fails to examine it as the out- come of the work preceding it, or because he does not relate the poet's technical achievements to his intellectual ones. But Nelson's use of "the thirties" as a magic talisman to be employed whenever reference is made to the early poetry (except "Petition") and his constant movement between the pseudo-historical and literary contexts have this effect. Partially as a result, the perspective he establishes is too narrow, denudes the poetry of too much meaning, and often renders particular judgments suspect (the statements quoted above, for example, or the view that Caliban and Malin are more to be identified with Auden than other characters are, or that Auden's Christianity precludes all belief in social progress [a question of degree], etc.). Changes of Heart could have been a better book had the subject been approached more sympathetically, or at least from the "inside," and if the author had not sought to make the man's political viewpoint the measure of the poet. Wright, George T. W. H. AUDEN, Twayne's United States Authors Series, No. 144. New York, 1969. 180 pp. $3.95. Reviewed by STEPHEN M. GILL, Ottawa University W. H. Auden is one of the controversial poets of today. Many attempts have been made to link together his different forms of poems on various topics and discover a consistency in them, but without much success. Some critics have dubbed him a Marxist, for this, they deem, is the spring of inspiration of most of Auden's poetic creations. Wright denounces these critics again and again by specifying Marx's impact on only two plays and a handful of poems written during the middle period of Auden's poetic career. He broadly divides the poet's intellectual develop- ment into three phases. The first lasts roughly up to 1930. During this period Auden probes mainly the ills of modern society with the aim of discovering means to cure them. He employs dream symbols and parables to indicate the spiritual predicament and inner conflicts of contemporary man. Wright repeatedly stresses that these poems represent a Freudian clash between the elders and the child, not the commonly held view of Marx's class struggle. In the second phase Auden intermingles Freud and Marx. From 1930, he started emerging also as a Christian poet. The book's general tone suggests that Auden was never wholly attracted by the Marxian ideology; the chief influences on his poetry are Christianity and psychology. The author oscillates his discussion between Auden's ever changing and developing style and his thoughts. Beneath these shifts, he perceives a certain amount of uncertainity, doubt, a sense of loneliness and the meaninglessness of life. He also points out that behind Auden's experi- ments with different forms was the attempt to find out the one which would suit him the best, and this helped him at the same time to achieve impersonality in his presentation. Vagueness, obscurity, and difficult 723</page><page sequence="18">ellipses are the obvious features of his early poetry. The use of dream symbols also makes them incomprehensible. From 1932, his involvement with communism shaped his direct and open style which brought him closer to the general public. This style dominates the poems of Look Stranger!, in which ambiguity and elliptical speech have been much reduced. After 1930, he became versatile and prodigious; this haste af- fected many of his poems. The second and third chapters are important to the understanding of Auden as they shed a great deal of light on his background. These concern the medical profession of his parertts, his study of mineralogy, and his interest in fairy tales and music. Among the writers whom Auden read and admired are Hardy, Wilfred Owen, Housman, Frost, Robert Graves, Eliot, Hopkins, Freud, Homer Lane, and D. H. Lawrence. The treatment of Freud and Homer Lane is fairly detailed and interesting. The socio-economic conditions of England, especially the repercussions of the global war and Auden's reaction to them, are brought forth sys- tematically. Wright has tried to compress his deliberations on almost the whole work of the poet into a book of modest length. The result is an inade- quate treatment of the bulk of Auden's poetry, a fact that Wright himself concedes in the Preface. The quest motif, for instance, is dismissed with only a few casual mentions here and there. Since this aspect is considered to be strong in Auden's poetry, it itself deserves a separate chapter. Nonetheless, Wright shows a new direction in Audenian criticism, and he writes in a direct and simple style. That is commendable. B Stoll, John E. W. H. AUDEN: A READING.

Twayne's English Authors Series, No. 91. New York, 1969.150 pp. $4.50. Reviewed by AUGUSTINE MARTIN, University College, Dublin I shall try not to be vengeful about Professor Boyle's book. A section of his first chapter is entitled "Critical Misunderstanding," and I am its sole target. The reference is to a slight article which I wrote some thirteen years 727</page><page sequence="22">ago for the Belfast magazine, Threshold. In it I made points like these that Behan had affinities with the theatre of the absurd, that he had pioneered a new form in the modern theatre, that the hero of Borstal Boy has much in common with Holden Caulfield. I also made a serious blunder mentioning that the "quare fellow" had killed his wife, not his brother. Professor Boyle concludes that a mistake like this "must ultimately lead to an inaccurate interpretation." He therefore ignores my modest critical observations and goes on making heavy weather of it to discover that Behan created a new dramatic form, that his affinities were with the theatre of the absurd, that there are useful parallels between Holden Caulfield and the hero of Borstal Boy. The book's chief fault if we overlook the truculence of its general tone-is that it forces Behan into the Joycean stereotype of artistic persecution and alienation from country and religion. Behan, for instance, was pampered into delinquency by his rich Granny English; but Boyle must paint him as a poor boy forced to leave school to earn a living. In his account Behan is repelled by '8the life-denying bend of Catholicism," dogged by a vindictive state, badgered and misunderstood by jealous Dublin critics and writers. The opposite is the truth: despite his out- rageous behaviour Dublin adored Behan; literary Dublin was one large conspiracy to make him settle down and write; he always boasted being a "bad Catholic"; he died in the Church and had the biggest funeral Dublin ever gave a writer. When the facts don't fit the stereotype, prejudice is invoked. When the Dublin audience did not riot at the first run of An Giall the original Irish version of The Hostage-it must be because "very few of them could understand Irish well enough." Behan's lunatic behaviour during the 1. R. A. terrorist campaign is interpreted to illustrate "English cruelty and Irish stupidity." When, for instance, he gets a fourteen year sentence for firing point-blank on Dublin police in 1942, it is seen as "cruel" and "disproportionate to the crime." Boyle assures us that Behan "did not really intend to shoot anyone," despite the fact that one of the bullets pierced Detective Hanrahan's overcoat under the arm. The author depends for his biographical facts on second-hand and often dubious sources, e.g. Sean O'Callaghan's ludicrous "history" of the l.R.A. The carelessness with which he handles these facts is reflected in his consistent failure to spell correctly the names of such central figures as Governor Kavanagh of Mountjoy Prison, Eoin O'Mahony, and Behan's London publisher, Hutchinson. In the critical sections he is constantly defending Behan against im- probable charges that"Joan Littlewood wrote The Quare Fellow," that "some other mysterious angel" wrote Borstal Boy. No accuser is named. He condemns "the prudish outrage of the Irish public," yet he recoils at the "lewdness" of Granny Growl who says that her husband was shot in the Dardanelles and of Granny Grunt who remarks that it was "a most painful part of the body to be shot." But perhaps his finest insight is contained in this comment on the meaning of The Quare Fellow: "Behan simply, if rather crudely, is asking, 'Do dead men need chamber pots?; Do dead men sing of love?; Can prison stifle the human spirit?"' I'd like to hear Brendan's reply to that one. 728 </page><page sequence="23">SAUL BELLOW A Malin, Irving. SAUL BELLOW'S FICTION. Preface by Harry T. Moore. Cross- currents / Modern Critiques. Southern Illinois University Press, 1969. 180 pp. $4.95. Reviewed by JOSEPH J. WALDMEIR, Michigan State University This book is devoted primarily to four separate chapters on Bellow as writer, plus a chapter on his first published story which leads the dis- cussion off and a chapter on Herzog which presumably rounds it off. There is also a conclusion which amounts hardly to anything at all. If that seems a particularly cold or harsh opening paragraph, i*'s meant to be. Someone, sometime, will have some especially important things to say about Saul Bellow, whom Malin himself calls "probably the most important living American novelist." I really believe that Malin is that man. But I'm bored and disenchanted with books that string together previously published essays and jerry-build relationships between them, especially when it is apparent that with a bit of hard work the result could have been solid and substantial instead of just another easy publication. For instance, Chapter Two of this work, on Bellow's themes, is a distinct contribution to Bellow criticism. Malin cites five themes: moha (or materialism), madness, time, masquerade, and Jewishness. He defines each carefully, even to their interrelatedness, and examines each as it functions in selected works. I found it especially illuminating and intriguing, and I expected the balance of the book somehow to grow out of it, to be an amplification of the suggestions and conclusions it con- tains. But such is not the case. The chapters on the characters, the images, and the styles stand alone, hardly even bothering to imply relationships. Indeed, one of them, '@Seven Images," is substantially the same piece that Malin included in his excellent colleetion, Saul Bellow and the Critics. I do not mean to say that they cannot stand alone, for indeed they can, as interesting and provocative critical approaches. I do mean, however, that the chapter on the themes overshadows them and offers an implicit invitation to some sort of unifying principle which would make Saul Bellowos Fiction more of a book than a collection of essays. The attempt to achieve unification by means of the brief chapter on Herzog seems to me abortive first of all because it assumes that this novel is the capstone of Bellow's career and secondly because, as if anticipating my criticism, Malin decided that he had better find some way to pull things together. But Bellow is a writer of immense versatility, and one might as easily have called Henderson the Rain King or The \/ictim his ultimate achievement as Herzog, even though they appeared long before. And in addition, the chapter is simply unconvincing; it's dull and un- inspired, though certainly its facts are straight. Incidentally, to Malin's immense credit, all that he has to say in this study applies equally well to Bellow's most recent novel, Mr. Sammler's Planet, which Malin obviously had no opportunity to deal with here. Perhaps ultimately that is the test of a book, whether or not one likes 729</page><page sequence="24">its organization or its unity: is it perceptive, honest, and right? Saul Bellowos Fiction is all of these things. But it could have been a better book. C Cohen, Sarah Blacher. The Comic Elements in the Novels of Saul Bel/ow Northwestern, 1969, Ernest Samuels.

YANNELLA Joe Gould, the manufacturer of the apocryphal Oral History of America and an exquisite practitioner of marginality, once remarked, "It is the duty of the bohemian to call attention to himself./' Were this the only standard by which the avant-garde artist could be judged, Maxwell Bo- denheim would be a complete success. His youthful poses, his mature excesses, his deterioration into an alcoholic haze, all seemed calculated to bring him before the public. Even his murder in a bowery flophouse in 1954 was an event tailor-made for a sensational press. For a whole gene- ration of middle Americans he was, variously, a libertine fake, a freak a buffoon, in shortt the archetypal Village writer. He was never simply a poet. No member of the avant-garde is ever simply a poet, of course; in Bodenheim's case, though, the extreme became the rule, the man so overshadowed the work that his poetry and the several novels and plays he also wrote were almost totally neglected. He sold a lot of newspapers. He did not sell many books. At one time, near the beginning of his career, Bodenheim enjoyed a reputation which placed him alongside Pound, Eliot, and Williams. Now, I guess, he is not read at all, and none of his more than twenty-five 730</page><page sequence="25">books is in print. There are others who have suffered the same fate. And the cXiches about the suffering of neglect and "rehabilitating" reputations aside, one is forced to ask whether Bodenheim really has a pXace in the perfect anthology of American poetry, whether an enterprising publisher should re-issue his novels. To some extent, Jack B. Moore answers these questions affirmatively. But he is a sensible and perceptive critic who argues the only argument possible under the circumstances: there are a few remarkably successful Bodenheim poems, several things of interest, and much that is flawed, mediocre, or simply bad. Since Maxwell Bodenheim is aimed at re-introducing the writer to a forgetful critical public, the reader is likely to be disappointed. Howevert this is always the case with books dealing seriously with second and third- rate talents. And, in any case, Moore has performed a useful service. For one thing, he has managed to correct some of the distortions about Bodenheim's life, revealing the essential character behind the many masks and newspaper reports. In lieu of a full-scale biography of Boden- heim, this is by far the very best biographical presentation to date. Sec- ondly, Moore provokes his readers to at least look at Bodenheim's work, for the first time perhaps, and in this regard he may arouse an interest, though I do not see the dawning of a Bodenheim renaissance. Finally, Maxwell Bodenheim brxngs to our attention the existence of a figure im- portant to American literary history in the twentieth century. He was involved with the Chicago Renaissance, with the Provincetown Players, and with several little magazines. Scarcely a memoir of the twenties or thirties which deals with New York fails to mention him. Now that some of the groundwork has been skillfully done by Moore, one hopes that there will be more interest shown in Bodenheim. As a committed avant- gardist, as an historical figure, even as a poet with a degree of talent, he deserves it. JORGE LUIS BORGES A Stabb, Martin S. JORGE LU IS BORGES. Twayne's World Authors Series, No. 108. New York, 1970. 180 pp. $4.95. Review pending. Wheelock, Carter. THE MYTHMAKER: A STUDY OF MOTIF AND SYMBOL IN THE SHORT STORIES OF JORGE LUIS BORGES. University of Texas Press, 1969. 190 pp. $6. Reviewed by MARGARET SAYERS PEDEN, University of Missouri, Columbia It is Professor Wheelock's intention in this study of the fiction of Jorge Luis Borges to propose a pattern by which all of Borges' fictions may be systematically analysed and discussed. Thematic studies, ethical, mathe- matical, mystical, and other approaches to such analysis have, according to the author, failed to capture the underlying unity in Borges' work. Professor Wheelock's study does expose such a pattern. Usi ng what he refers to as an 'extra-l iterary" approach, the author systematizes and categorizes the metaphysic of Borges' fiction. This creation, he says, is simpGy "the artistic representation of the form of 731</page><page sequence="26">human ideation." In Borges' labyrinth, he suggests, the human mind is the objective universe, and the contents of that mind the objects in the outer world. Thus Borges as a mythmaker is obviously not the naive primitive, but the conscious skeptic, the esthetic consciousness assigning "only brief validity to the various perspectives of the universe, forming and dissolving them in sequence until, in memory at least, they are all present at once, building in an imperfect way the comprehensive Aleph." As a point of departure for his formula, Wheelock proposes the adop- tion of the terms Zahir and Aleph: Zahir for the specific, obsessive per- ception of the world, as contrasted to the universal perception of it, the Aleph. He then catalogues and divides recurring symbols in two collec- tions of Borges' fictions (Ficciones and Labyrinths) in relation to these two principal divisions. For example, sun, coin, tree, bull, are Zahires, and circular things, stone, night, certain colors, are Alephs, although as sym- bols they must not be relegated to their thematic interpretation. These two groups of symbols represent opposing forces, tensions between which hovers the esthetic phenomenon, not unlike, Wheelock says, the differ- ence "between Platonic and nominalistic approaches to reality, with ideal- ism transcending them." For purposes of synthesis I might suggest, then, this very reduced version of his thesis: Zahir-specific world perception- Platonic approach to reality is opposed to Aleph-universal world percep- tion-nominalist approach to reality, and between them, or transcending them, the esthetic, creative, Symbolist phenomenon-idealist approach to reality. After the definition of his system and a detailed discussion of eight fictions which best illustrate his premise, Wheelock briefly applies this pattern to twenty-seven additional stories, substantiating his claim that where a thematic analysis may not completely encompass the body of Borges' work, an examination of these stories using the human thought process as a basis does reveal a fundamental consistency in Borges' literary philosophy. The language of this book may be a problem for the reader who has not had considerable exposure to philosophical and metaphysical termin- ology, in spite of the author's assertion that "it is the aim of this study to . . . point out, in the simplest language possible, that this thought form is visible." What is more important, perhaps, is that I am not convinced that I now have any deeper understanding of Borges' work, of what he is saying, though I do find the ideas in the study useful and convincing insofar as they identify an overall pattern or schemata.

At work on a novel about a girl who raises a tiger cub. Another hellcat like Cora Papadakis in The Postman Always Rings Twice, I hope. Cain has been pretty much out of sight for about twenty years. David Madden's book brings him back like a revival of old Humphrey Bogart movies and asks some of the right questions. How is he a part of that by-gone era before the Affluent Society began to emerge? What is the cultural meaning of his violent tales of sex mixed with murder? Madden comes up with some of the right answers. If the Depression was the time when the American Dream became a nightmare, then there was need for some new fantasies. Cain came along and produced dis- tortions, even perversions, of the Horatio Alger success story. The striving young hero turns to crime in order to get money. You can't get it by working hard and keeping your nose clean any more. And the girl he goes for is no longer the boss's sweet and encouraging daeghter. She is the boss's whorish wife. The fascination in the story is not just in the fulfillment of forbidden wishes but in the kind of hero a masculine, commanding figure, with American technical know-how (to be able to rig a perfect murder, for instance) who has the courage to stake everything on the success of a daring scheme So far, all right. But Madden goes on to suggest that be- cause Cain's books have no thematic statements they are therefore "pure" novels like Flaubert's. Which is a phony critical gimmick. No one needs to create a puff for the writer who has 'imited aims but who does the job with great skill. The virtue of Cain's best works like The Postman or Double Indemnity lies not just in the cultural myths he supposedly reflects but in the economy of language and episode that makes his moral fables become stark, ironic vignettes. They pack into 150 pages the hero's sexual victories and his complex scheme for grab- bing money, all of which culminates in his discovery that getting what he wants is a fatal disaster.

Reviewed by GERMA/NE BREE, 1nstitute for Research in the Humanities, (Jniversity of Wisconsin In his, within its chosen limits, quasi-exhaustive bibliography Robert Roeming lists 2691 items books or articles about Camus, the cut-off date for his listing being 1966. This in itself underscores how wide an audience Camus' work has commanded. A further proof is furnished by the indexes classifying the authors and journals mentioned "by country and language." They refer to some forty countries. This enormous and widespread critical output, which has not yet shown signs of tapering off, though it is uneven in quality, has necessarily brought about a deeper general lJnderstanding of the quality and nature of Camus' work. This i5 apparent if we compare Robert de Luppe's early (1952 in the French "editions universitaires") Albert Camus, recently published in translation for a paperback series, with Phillip Rhein's 1969 Albert Camus. Both are aimed at a student audience, although Phillip Rhein's book would also be of value to non-specialized readers interested in getting a general insight into Camus' world Robert de Luppe's work dates back almost twenty years; the fact is nowhere indicated. The British translator, John Cumming, has furnished a seven-page analysis of The Fall. In a one-page 1958 preface the only date mentioned for the French editions de Luppe mentions Exile and the Kingdom and the collection of essays entitled L'Ete (Sum- mer). On occasion a brief allusion is made to later Camus writings. But de Luppe has not revised his 1952 text. He makes this clear in the 1958 preface: "Let us try . . . to understand that initial inspiration which nourishes [Camus'] work" (italics mine). However, in the copyright acknowledgements only the date of the British translation -1966-is given; the 1958 preface then appears. The brief biographical note and the selected bibliography accompanying the translation were carefully up- dated for the British publication; though the bibliography was not sub- sequently revised by the Minerva Press to include even as essential an 736</page><page sequence="31">item as the 1965 Essaysw the second volume of the "Bibliotheque de la Pleiade" collected works of Camus. In combination with the updating, the omission of the original date of de Luppe's study is disturbing, and it is misleading both in regard to Camus and to de Luppe. A minor flaw -given the purpose of the book-is the failure to replace obviously British terms (The Outsider, Cross-purpose; "upper sixth form master") by their American equivalents. These reservations, of course, do not reflect either upon de Luppe's essay or the British translators. De Luppe's essay is didactic in intent, planned as a student manual, in the French tradition narrowly limited in its scope. It clarifies, classifiesr summarizes, avoids any allusion except the barest mention of a few names to the philosophical, literary or even political context of the work. Luppe's intention "was to retrace the development of Albert Camus' ideas' (1958 preface) from The Myth of S;syphus to The Just. The "digests" of The Myth of Sisyphus and of The Rebel are certainly the best part of the book, the most useful, whereas the analysis of The Outsider (Stranger), The Plague and, even more obviously the brief pages on Camus' theater and style will seem very thin to students today. Cumming's presentation of The Fall, brief though it is, in contrast shows a far more so,3histicated grasp of the mythical elements at work in Camus' fictional universe: a dozen years of intense critical analysis have considerably sharpened his method of approach. Although this literary insight is still somewhat lacking in Phillip Rhein's book, which tends to the ethical interpretation rather than to the literary analysis of Camus' work, the volume is in every way, given the limits imposed by the series, an exceptionally rich and valuable introduction to Camus' work There are a couple of minor errors that one hesitates to point out: Camus was not a student at Mondovi, but in Algiers, where his mother had settled very early in his life; Meursault is not executed in Camus' novel; he does not'@go to his death," and remains until the end, "the man condemned to death"-not the man executed, which is indeed a main point in the story, and makes him the exem,3lary figure he be- comes. But the book is solid in its presentation, precise and clear in its analysis and so direct and honest too in its critical stance that it more than fulfills the stated aim of the Twayne Series. One may not agree with some of the literary appraisals-and I certainly do not but the overall presentation of "the gradual evolution of Camus' thought into an art and a philosophy that bears his particular seal" Rhein's stated purpose is excellent. The difference in scope between the perspectives he opens up and Luppe's helpful but elementary suggestions is in itself revealing. Robert Roeming's bibliography includes all the writings by Camus, with the exception, which he notes, of the newspaper articles and editorials listed by Emmett Parker in his book Albert Camus: The Artist in the Arena and again by Roger Quilliot in Essais, the second volume of the Bibliotheque de la Pleiade edition of Camus' complete works. It includes, besides, as I have mentioned, an extensive listing of works about Camus that have come out in some forty countries. Mr. Roeming modestly considers his work as only "the first step toward a definitive compilation," but students of Camus will greet the volume with gratitude. Of major interest is the fact that this is a computerized bibliography, an experiment in a new 737 </page><page sequence="32">ALBERT CAMUS technique. The disadvantage/ of course, is that there is no way of know- ing how valuable any simple entry may be; the compilation cannot be selective. But the advantages greatly outweigh the disadvantage. The organization is simple: works by Camus, listed in alphabetical order, followed by articles, collections, interviews, letters, prefaces, translations and adaptations, works about Camus listed alphabetically by author. Three supplementary indexes provide further valuable information, all three ordered "by country and language": an author index, a journal index, and a chronological index. Mr. Roeming's bibliography is a most valuable contribution to scholarship, a model of its kind. O'Brien, Conor Cruise. ALBERT CAMUS OF EUROPE AND AMERICA. Modern Masters.

University of Alabama Press, 1970.160 pp. $6.50. Reviewed by BEN STOLTZFUS, University of California at Riverside. Jean Onimus' study of Camus' Christian temperament implies that Camus' thought, as it was revealed in his writings up to the moment of his death, was incomplete and that, had he lived, it might have matured enough to allow for that transcendent leap of faith without which man is doomed to tread the morass of atheistic nihilism. Camus' car accident did end his life prematurely. Had he lived, however, I doubt that he would have blessed his Christian admirers with a dramatic conversion. Onimus argues that Camus' cosmic contemplation showed itself cap- able of leading toward religious ecstasy whenever he or his fictional characters came into deep and profound contact with nature. The loss of self in the oneness of nature is a necessary prelude, argues Onimus, to the next and higher step which is acceptance of His oneness and im- mersion in God. This study attempts to demonstrate that the reasons for Camus' non-belief are biographical, intellectual, and historical, yet Onimus' arguments are based on the sketchiest of biographical informa- tion (as Emmet Parker's notes so nicely show), misreadings of text, and religious bias. Onimus has the ability to summarize brilliantly a Camus text, even capture his meaning in a few sentences, and time after time 738</page><page sequence="33">the reader says "yes, this is Camus," only to see his ideas evolve into something that Camus did not intend. Let me give an example: Onimus blames Camus for the contemporary utopistic dilemma of deifying History, yet much of l'Homme revolte is devoted to a reasoned critique of the pitfalls of such deification. Camus repeatedly stressed the notion that the means do not justify the ends because if they did, then the face of History (as this century has already demonstrated), like God's, would be smeared with the blood of its victims. Man rebels against an unjust God, a cruel tyrant, or History precisely because these forces, by enslaving him, also negate him. Camus was not an existentialist (as Onimus freely admits) because revolt implied the affirmation of certain a priori values which would give man a certain essence, i.e. essence before existence which is of course what the existentialists deny. Rebellion makes no sense if we don't rebel for something. Camus wanted rebellion in the name of justice and the dignity of man. So the slave who rebels against a tyrannical master in order to preserve his selfhood is already affirming a positive value in the face of what is normally interpreted as a negative act. The slave is saying "no" to the master and "yes" to himself. A metaphysical rebel is one who says "no" to the tyranny of death and the apparent indifference of the cosmos. We are all metaphysical slaves in that we are "trapped" by life and death. So the metaphysical rebel who values life must reject death and all those forces (natural or religious) which seem to be responsible for it. Hence the duality in Camus' thought and in his fictional characters. But this "no" is the most positive act in Camus' hierarchy of values. It is not, as Onimus says, merely an attempt to give positive meaning. It is the basis of positive meaning and depends for its existence on the slave's (man's) rejection of his master (God). Camus' whole philosophy, if indeed we can call it that, since it is not a system, is based on man's lucid evaluation of this human condition. Camus' notion of the absurd is based on man's rejection of the transcen- dent. In the wake of God's disappearance, the metaphysical rebel affirms the supremacy of man. One of the aberrations of the twentieth-century is, as Onimus notes, that with God's disappearance certain regimes have deified History. But Camus was always an explicit and outspoken critic of such political systems. So to equate Camus with atheistic nihilism, as Onimus does, is indeed to misrepresent the facts. Christians will perhaps like Onimus' book because it situates Camus within the Christian ethical tradition yet faults him for his non-belief Camus' admirers may want to skip this book unless they are interested in the whole phenomenon of religious proselytizing. Though not as extreme, and obviously too late, this study reminds me of the concerted though futile efforts of Claudel and Co. to convert Gide. At least the Gide- Claudel correspondence had its ironic, satiric, and comic moments climaxed with a telegram from Gide to Franc,ois Mauriac, allegedly from beyond the grave, saying: "There is no hell. You can go on a spree. Inform Claudel." Gide engaged his opponents in deliberate religious dialogue whereas Camus remained indifferent to the viscissitudes of faith and conscience. This explains perhaps why believers try so often to assimilate him into 739</page><page sequence="34">their camp, but have made no posthumous efforts to recuperate Gide. Camus was not critical of their faith. He simply found it irrelevant. His work is a lucid argument against its relevance and fairly categorical at that. So I find it amusing and mildly irritating that "believers" continue to add their "mature" part to the body of his thought. Camus was a man distressed by mortality, by suffering, and injustice; he was a man who refused the refuge of blind ideology; a man who stressed the need for happiness, the fulfillment of self, and the dignity of all. His work says that if we are to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth, we need to eradicate evil, so that the exile of man's suffering will come to an end. Revolt to things as they are is a prelude to happiness on those sunny beaches where man's honeymoon (life) can mature in contact with others, nature, beauty, and art. Camus was profoundly impressed with man's unhappniess and his duplicity and gave such feelings full expression in The Fall, whose northern skies and grey pessimism, says Onimus, reflect Camus' profound spiritual malaise. And well they might. As though such malaise proved the need to free Camus from his earthly bonds. If he chose to remain on earth rather than speculate about heaven it was because he refused to associate himself with causes which avoided immediate commitment to justice in favor of the ritual of postponed rewards. If God does not exist, then man is free. Kirilov commits suicide in The Possessed to demonstrate a freedom which is a point of departure for both Sartre and Camus. In his play Caligula Camus explores the conse- quences of such freedom, by giving his tyrant the necessary freedom of choice to act out the consequences of his "revolt." If Caligula's logical madness leads him to a destructive impasse it is because Camus is demonstrating that Caligula's choice negates the life and dignity of his constituents. They rebel in turn and assassinate him, because he has destroyed those very qualities which gave meaning to life. His lesson has been relentless and logical. He has usurped the prerogatives of God and nature by killing at random. Onimus affirms that Camus gave birth to such tragedy because he could not choose between truth and happiness, a conclusion based on a singular misreading of the play. As long as Camus extolls man's ecstasy in communion with nature, Onimus says it is "religious." But when Camus applies the lessons of the absurd to man, Onimus says the vision (which derives from nature) is deficient and not matured. This is indeed to misrepresent the basis of Camus' thought for the sake of an ideology which runs counter to it. In conclusion, a few words are in order about Parker's excellent translation, preface, and notes. They help to situate the book's con- troversial nature as well as to point out some of the deficiencies in Oni- mus' approach. But the printer seems to have forgotten Noces since it does not appear in the list of abbreviations used for textual references. Camus devotees will find this book highly readable even though they will probably not agree with Onimus' conclusion that the drama of Camus' atheistic humanism depends on his having turned against the "reign of humanity" after having deified it.

Reviewed by HUGH AGEE, University of Georgia To the casual reader of Truman Capote's work, the blood-and-guts account of In Cold B/ood may seem far removed from the Gothic dream world of Other Voices, Other Rooms, almost as though these were books by different authors. A desire to understand this seeming paradox is the basis of William L. Nance's The Wor/ds of Truman Capote. The "worlds" of which Professor Nance speaks are the private dream world of Capote's early fiction and the world of social experience which he attains in In Cold Blood. The "spiritual liberation" of Joel Knox in Other Voices, Other Rooms marks the end of the one and the beginning of the artist's journey toward the other. The course of this unique journey between these worlds is charted by Capote's later stories (notably "A Christmas Memory" and "Among the Paths to Eden"), The Grass Harp, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and The Muses Are Heard. This chronological movement from one world to the other furnishes a logical framework for this first major study of Capote. One of the intentions of this study is "to show that the changes in Capote's career have not been casual but are the result of a strong and highly conscious effort at growth." Growth for Capote, we learn, is characterized by change in mood from darkness to light, in treatment from subjectivity to objectivity, in range from the manipulation of a few characters to the handling of many, in style from the poetic to the journalistic. In Nance's words: "Change, to Capote, is not just something that happens to you: it is something you do." In spite of a merging of Capote's art with real life in his later work, one constant persists, as Nance points out: "Capote's impulse, from 'A Tree of Night' [his first story published in 1943] to In Cold Blood, is to accept and understand the 741</page><page sequence="36">'abnormal' person." This observation helps us understand Capote's plac- ing Perry Smith at the center of In Cold B/ood. Nance's careful analysis of Capote's fiction and nonfiction, supported at times by statements gleaned from interviews with the author, will be welcomed by those undertaking a study of Truman Capote. Nance is faithful to his material in support of his intentions, and we come away feeling that Capote has changed during his growth as an artist and that "there are few American writers of his generation who show so much promise of varied and important work still to be done." At the same time, we must acknowledge that the critical stance of The Worlds of Truman Capote is not entirely without precedent, as a reader of George Garrett's essay on In Cold B100d in The Hollins Critic (February 1966) will discover. This is not meant to impugn Nance, for his is a much needed book that has been done well. If anything, it is merely that we wish that he might have enlarged on one or two points in Garrett's essay. In that both Nance and Garrett acknowledge a link between Capote and the Romantic Movement in American literature, Garrett's notion that Capote's treat- ment of Perry, especially at the hanging, leaves him "as a kind of in- verted, mid-century Billy Budd" seems an image worth pursuing, particu- larly with reference to the author's "objective" handling of his material. On the latter point, Nance and Garrett agree that Capote fails to bring off the "nonfiction novel" as a new genre, though for different reasons. For Nance, "Capote's aim eluded his grasp, as it would have eluded anyone's." At best, In Cold Blood is but another "documentary novel," though "certainly one of the finest specimens of that 'impure genre' and quite possibly the best piece of artistic journalism ever written." Citing such works as Cummings' The Enormous Room and Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon as forerunners of this genre, Garrett dismisses Capote's claim of a new form as a publisher's device. In the final analysis, Professor Nance brings us to a viable under- standing of the paradoxical Mr. Capote, who is "the dedicated artist who writes only for money; the man who can witness a friend's execution, mentally record it with cool precision, then cry for three days; the play- boy who gives a party for a few 'personal friends' and invites Who's Who in America; the eccentric youth who surprised the world into admiration."

Reviewed by JACOB H. ADLER, Purdue University Chekhov's life is not easy to recount. First, he is a complex and elusive man whose behavior is often contradictory and sometimes, as in his famous trip to Sakhalin, simply a conundrum. Objective, detached, an indefatigable worker both as physician and as writer, his actions neverthe- less seem at times as confused, as self-centered, and even as meaningless as those of the characters in his own plays. M. Gilles is correct and illumi- nating in saying that The Sea Gull presents aspects of Chekhov himself in Trigorin, in Treplev, and in Dr. Dorn. Indeed, he might have added Sorin, because as early as The Sea Gull, Chekhov was already thinking of himself as an old man and believing that life had passed him by. Second, Chekhov's life is not easy to recount because once he has established himself as a writer, much of his life is uneventful and repeti- tious. There are high spots, of course, such as the success of The Sea Gull in Moscow and Chekhov's odd wedding and honeymoon; but more often one could easily grow bored with Chekhov's own professions of boredom, with his random traveling, with his buying of estates, with the minutiae of his visits to St. Petersburg, with his attracting and eluding women, even with his tuberculosis. It is to Gilles' credit that in spite of an occasional needless descriptive repetition (especially on the subject of a tuber- cular's symptomatic urge to travel), and in spite of providing at times 743</page><page sequence="38">an overabundance of unenlightening detail, he does quite well in holding one's interest through the long Russian winters of Chekhov's years. He does less well in making us see the man in his work. Genius is by definition inexplicable, but one leaves this biography with the false and unsatisfying impression that hard work, keen observation, and sympathetic detachment provide in this case a total explanation. Chekhov the man M. Gilles analyses very well. Chekhov the writer particularly Chekhov the writer of plays to a degree eludes him. A part of the problem is that he does not put Chekhov sufficiently in context. We are not told enough for example, about Chekhov's reading, and in spite of his frequent contacts with other writers, we are not given adequate indication of his place in Russian, and European, literature. We are given the usual indi- cations of the characteristics of Chekhov's plays (though M. Gilles under- estimates plot and would benefit from a close reading of David Magar- shack); but it would help to have his work compared with that of the other great Russian writers of fiction who turned to drama, such as Tolstoy and Turgenev. He does offer some interesting comments on the plays themselves. He is right, for example, in emphasizing the absurdity of the characters' behavior, with the implication that it anticipates the absurdist theater; and his analysis of The Cherry Orchard provides a num- ber of valuable insights. But he confuses the relationships of the characters in The Sea Gu/l, is far too sure of the motivation for Treplev's suicide, and expresses the startling opinion that in calling that play a comedy Chekhov was being dishonest. And he does not wrestle with such prob- lems as the unusual ending of The Sea Gull, the somewhat gratuitous duel in The Three Sisters, or the fact that while Chekhov objected to Stani- slavsky's introduction of various sound effects, he nevertheless provided various sound effects of his own. The book is best in its picture of Chekhov the man. Gilles understands and sympathizes, and he succeeds in making the reader do the same. And one is grateful that he does so without riding any psychological hobbyhorse. His belief that Chekhov was incapable of real tenderness, of revealing or giving himself fully to anyone, is persuasive and provides as good a clue as any to some of Chekhov's behavior. On the other hand, the subtitle of the book, "Observer Without Illusion," is misleading, since Gilles shows that Chekhov was perfectly capable of deluding himself, particularly regarding his treatment of women. Charles Lam Markmann's translation of M. Gilles work is not only work- manlike, it is frequently felicitous; but the book is marred by numerous typographical errors, some of them fairly serious. This is not a volume for specialists, it is certainly not the definitive biography. One might wonder indeed why, in the face of the numerous biographies written in English, it was felt necessary to translate this one at all. But for the non-specialist it is a readable, interesting, and apparently reliable introduction to Chekhov the man. B Talento, Louis V. ANTON CHEKHOV: THE THREE SISTERS / THE CHERRY ORCHARD.

JEAN COCTEAU: AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS FILMS AND PHILOSOPHY. Translated by Ciba Vaughan. Crown Publishers, 1969. 192 pp. $2.95 pb. Reviewed by BETTINA L. KNAPP, Hunter College of City University of New York An Impersonation of Angels is a fascinating account of the times into which Jean Cocteau was born "la belle epoque" in which he grew up and helped to promote and fructify Cubism, Dadaism and Surrealism. Professor Brown has stunningly succeeded in bringing to life Jean Cocteau and his friends and patrons as well, creating for the reader a clear and decisive picture of his roles as novelist, dramatist, poet, director, artist, scenario-writer, and so on. One seeks in vain, however, to be led beneath surfaces, to ferret out the significance of such works as Le Potomak and Les Enfants terribles, which are merely glossed over; to try to divine Cocteau's own traumas concerning the creative process per se, about which he wrote so extensively. Brown opens his panoramic study of Cocteau's life and times with a glowing picture of de Max, the actor who enticed so many novices to his fold. Fleeting glimpses are then interwoven of such adulated stars as Sarah Bernhardt. Biographical material follows, adding to the luster and excitement of the framework. Jean Cocteau was born on July 5, 1889 at Maisons-Lafitte, near Paris. His parents, wealthy bourgeois, provided him with substantial economic security and entrees into high society. Moreover, the young Cocteau was endowed with natural gifts: he was handsome, slim, with dark hair combed forward to cover a broad forehead, a thin straight nose. Even at the age of ten, he found the theater a truly irresistible land of enchant- ment: remote, mysterious and forbidding. At this early period, his mother seemed to symbolize the theatre with the ritual she enacted on the nights she attended a performance at the Comedie-Francaise: there was the perfume aimed to intoxicate; the powder whose sole purpose seemed to be the beclouding of reality; the red velvet gown with balloon sleeves, glittering with embroidered black jet, designed to present her beautiful body forcefully; the jewels, the fur coat and the black-lace fan; and the final dramatic exit on the arm of her husband into the world of glamorous fantasy. Such was Cocteau's introduction to a world in which he was to make his mark in 1917 with Parade, a ballet for which he composed the argument, Erik Satie the music, and Picasso the costumes. Parade was a flame-thrower, searing a path for an aggressive period in modern art. Cocteau's life was both dynamic and creative, and Brown carries us through all the important phases of it, from the saddened years encom- passing both world wars and those following the second holocaust until Cocteau's demise in 1963, with brilliant descriptions of Cocteau in his various roles as novelist, poet, artist, essayist, and more. Brown focuses on those connected with this versatile innovator: Catulle Mendes, the critic who had beell Theophile Gautier's son-in-law, a friend of Victor 746</page><page sequence="41">Hugo and had spoken with the God of Gods Charles Baudelaire; Maurice Rostand, the poet; Jules Lemaitre, the redoubtable critic; Anna de Noailles, who created her own self-cult; the effete pseudo-poet Robert de Montesquiou; Reynoldo Hahn, the composer; Guillaume Apollinaire, the extraordinarily versatile ebullient poet and art critic. Although Cocteau was highly imaginative and his ingenuity and dex- terity boundless, he cannot be considered a true originator in the strict sense of the word, as Victor Hugo or Honore de Balzac were. Cocteau was a derivative writer; he needed an outside force to activate something within him, to stimulate and generate his own ideas and insights. Brown gives us a kaleidoscopic view of all those constellations in whose orbit Cocteau revolved. In an entirely different vein is Rene Gilson's Jean Cocteau: An Investi- gation into his Films and Philosophy. This volume, one of a series of monographs on film directors in Pierre Segher's collection entitled "Cinema d'aujourdthui," consists of a long, enticing essay on Cocteau's visionary views on cinematography and their importance in paving the way for modern film makers who place so much stress on visual enact- ments and so little on the dialogue, which stands out, as a result of this maneuver, sparse and chiseled. Excerpts from Cocteau's films and essays relating to the movie industry enhance the value of this volume still further. Rene Gilson begins his study with an analysis of The Blood of a Poet (1930), Cocteau's first film and the one in which he used "the cinema as a new vehicle for his poetry." In this work, now a classic of its kind, Cocteau infuses new vitality into an old theme: the poet does not survive, but his creation-the statue in this case lives on eternally. The Blood of a Poet is really a visual transposition of Cocteau's own unconscious. It contains those images that had always been meaningful to him: mirrors, mobile and talking statues, guardian angels, a chimney, cards, a herma- phrodite, and the like. These objects, startlingly photographed owing to Cocteau's rich imagination, immersed viewers in a totally new visual experience. The Eternal Return, for which Cocteau wrote the scenario and dialogue, is one of his most interesting because of the manner in which he trans- forms the medieval legend of Tristan and Iseult. Cocteau's cinemato- graphic conception of this myth abolished ratianal notions of space and time, bathed the spectator in the "eternal present," maintaining the archetypal nature of the protagonists. In so doing, the impact of the haunting themes love and death became that much more poignant. L'Aiglea deux tetes t1947) is, according to Rene Gilson, one of Coc- teau's "unknown" and "forgotten" films. This unfortunate relegation is perhaps due both to the choice of topic and to the cloak and dagger atmosphere which did not strike the fancy of the movie-going public right after World War II. Beauty and the Beast (1945), is an enchanting work in which Cocteau returns to his beloved and comforting world of the myth. In the realm of the marvelous conjured forth by Cocteau, the "realism of the unreal" created an atmosphere bathing in ambiguity which, paradoxically, illumi- nated the inner man. The film's philosophy is described by Rene Gilson 747</page><page sequence="42">IEAN COCTEAU in the following manner: "The Beast is he who must perish through love, and for the sake of love. From this death is reborn the same being, with the same face, scarcely different to all appearances; it is not a phenome- non of metamorphosis but of phoenixology, this progression of 'other selves' through which the poet, any person devoted to the fulfillment of his being, must live." In Les Parents terribles, a stunning commentary on the bourgeois family circle, there is an extreme economy of language, a stylization of gestures, both diminishing and accelerating rhythm which flows forth to a climax- and a camera lens so powerful as to detect the minutest facial crevices, the tiniest lines of anguish marked on each of the protagonists. The imprison- ment of each individual in his own "corner" representing his own flesh, in his own living quarters, symbolizing his soul, becomes more and more difficult to bear as Cocteau builds up anguishes, increasing the tragic nature of the figures he depicts by accelerating or diminishing the pace of the dialogue and the camera's penetrating eye. All of Cocteau's films are given precision treatment by Rene Gilson. There is no question but that he does justice to Cocteau's inventiveness and creativity in the cinematographic domain. His work is marred, un- fortunately, by unnecessary repetitions, particularly noticeable in the introductory chapters. Once he penetrates the heart of the matter he succeeds in explicating a domain in which Cocteau left his unmistakable stamp: a visual exteriorisation of his inner disorderly, multiple and tumultuous world. Mention must be made of Ciba Vaughan's excellent translation. Both Frederick Brown's and Rene Gilson's works add considerably to our knowledge of Cocteau, a modern Proteus difficult to understand, elusive, a legendary figure whose world was a haunting brew of fantasy, mystery and excitement. Cocteau once said: "I hope to be read by people who remain children at all costs. I can ferret them out from among thousands. A glance which looks out upon the pristine magic of the world is better protection from the insults heaped upon us by age, than all the beauty treatments, all the diets." Knapp, Bettina L. J EAN COCTEAU. Twayne's World Authors Series, No. 84. 180 pp. $4.95. Reviewed by THOMAS REES, University of Southwestern Louisiana The recognition of Jean Cocteau as one of the chief architects of the twentieth century aesthetic revolution is long overdue. Though justly recognized in France, Cocteau is neglected by all but a handful of British and American critics, and he is frequently passed off as a mere bricoleur or jongleur, a trickster who dabbles in many fields and is a master of none. Bettina L. Knapp's latest volume helps to fill this critical void by dis- pelling the illusion that Cocteau is nothing more than a sort of gifted amateur in the arts, a man with an amputated vision of life. Delicately tracing the somewhat irregular contours of Cocteau's genius from its beginnings in the Paris of 1906 to its consummation in Le Testamenf d'Orphee (1960), Dr. Knapp deftly exhibits the entire range of Cocteau's 748</page><page sequence="43">half-century of creativity as poet, novelist, essayist, graphic artist, and cinematographer. Essentially the book is a mixture-of biography and criticism. Although Dr. Knapp focuses her study on the task of evaluating and describing Cocteau's major works, she intersperses her criticism liberally with bio- graphical data that is relevant to the works, demonstrating time and again that she has thoroughly absorbed her subject. She shows the growth of Cocteau's artistic conscience as it evolves from the eclectic adolescent frivolity of his early verse to the seasoned maturity and classi- cal restraint of his later novels and films. Dr. Knapp carefully details the immense difficulties obstructing the poet's ascent to Parnassus. The first difficulty, paradoxically enough, arose from the enormous success of Cocteau's first volume of verse. In 1906 Edouard de Max, star of the Comedie-Francaise, rented the Theatre Femina and organized a public reading of Cocteau's poems to a special invited audience of celebrated actors, actresses, and society people; the listeners were enthralled, and even the most acidulous critic heaped praise upon the poems. But success was too easy and it came too early for the seventeen-year-old poet, leaving him a spoiled and undisciplined society pet, a prince frivole of Tout-Paris and the demi-monde. For the next six years Cocteau seemed to be living in an adolescent dream-world; he existed in fantasy until one day in 1912 when Sergei Diaghilev, bored by the dull facility of Cocteau's work, muttered the phrase "Etonne-moi!" (Surprise me). This command jolted Cocteau into nearly reversing his artistic attitudes so that his future productions would carry a force and movement designed to shock readers into deeper states of aesthetic perception. Later on, collaborating with Stravinski and Picasso, he learned the value of work, sincerity, and deep feeling: the artist must struggle and suffer in order to create. The most fruitful development in the maturation of Cocteau's artistic conscience came with his 1919 meeting with the fifteen-year-old Raymond Radiguet. Just as the aging composer Erik Satie had taught Cocteau the value of simple expression, Radiguet stressed concision and classical restraint, warning Cocteau to relinquish his role as an avant-garde leader and to concentrate on developing his own work. Radiguet's death in 1923 left a creative void in Cocteau's life and forced him to seek solace . . In oplum. Cocteau had nevertheless learned his lessons well from Radiguet, and the publication of Les Enfants terribles in 1929 demonstrated how well he had absorbed the young novelist's skills. Rejecting the automatism of surrealism, he made his new novel a model of concision, formal control, and directness, and the subsequent prose of Cocteau is characterized by a style that is simple, clear, masculine, and direct, in which metaphors are used as instruments of concision. In the early thirties Cocteau suddenly revealed himself as a master of cinematographic art with the production of the quasi-surrealist film Le Sang du poete. Such later films as La Belle et la bete (1945) and Orphee (1950), rich in symbolism and metaphor, indicate his skill in adding the dimension of poetry to the art of the film. Despite the obvious strengths of Dr. Knapp's study, there are a num- 749 </page><page sequence="44">ber of minor flaws that ought to be noted. Every so often, for example, the author brings up a significant fact concerning Cocteau's artistic development without relating this fact to analogous contemporaneous developments in the careers of other artists, thus failing to set Cocteau's work in its proper cultural milieu. Apropos, when she speaks of Cocteau's stylistic retrenchment in 1919, she neglects to mention that this aesthetic retrenchment was felt in all the arts of that year. Feeling that the aesthetic revolution of the 1910's had been carried too far and that their respective arts had already tended to degenerate into formlessness, such innova- tors as Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Picasso, and Stravinski all entered into a classically restrained and more formal mode of artistic production. In the concluding chapter, after heaping lavish praise on individual novels, plays, or films, and calling Les Enfants terribles "one of the great French works of all time," (p. 161) Dr. Knapp confesses two pages later that Cocteau is "not possessed of artistic genius." Elsewhere she asserts that Cocteau is not a "true creator" in the sense that Balzac is a creator (nor is Balzac a creator in the sense that Henry Fielding is one that is, if artists are to remain stylistically individuated). Through the sometimes telescopic lens of her criticism, Dr. Knapp seldom takes an intensive view of her subject. She seems to depend too heavily on the evaluative methods and judgments of Wallace Fowlie's pioneer work, lean Cocteau: The History of a Poet's Age (1966), and in so doing she has indulged in a sort of panoramic mode of criticism at the expense of exploring her sub)ect in depth. The above criticisms of Dr. Knapp's book, however, refer only to minor defects in an evaluative work of major significance. After all, the author has succeeded admirably in getting her point across: namely, that Jean Cocteau is one of the giants of our twentieth century artist culture whose creations are the products of a unique and superior intelligence and not the jottings of an inspired charlatan of arts and letters.

PADRAIC COLUM: A BIOGRAPHICAL-CRITICAL INTRODUC- TION. Crosscurrents / Modern Critiques. Southern Illinois University Press, 1970. 162 pp. $4.95. Reviewed by ROBERT HOGAN, University of Delaware Padraic Colum is an amazing man. He has lived so long, and has written so much, so variously and so well. His first published work appeared in 750</page><page sequence="45">1899, and his most recent work appeared this year. He was writing plays before John Synge was and before Lady Gregory was. He wrote well then, and he writes well now. The problem of making a living caused him to be so prolific. If he had had a private income, there probably would never have been all of his journalism, his travel books, his children's books, his biography of Griffith. He could do many things well, and making a living forced him to become a man of letters rather than primarily a poet or a playwright. This necessity of writing to order may not have been entirely bad, for sometimes when Colum has followed his own bent he has, to my mind, written poorly. His occasional flirtations with dramatic experiment such as the poetic fantasy Mogu of the Desert, the expressionistic Balloon, and the recent Noh plays seem to me Colum at his weakest. The example I know best, from having been involved in a production, is Moytura, the Noh play about Sir William Wilde; it seems to me static as theatre and, curiously for Colum, sometimes semi-legible in syntax. As a writer and as a man, Colum has qualities which are both valuable and mild. His strength and his weakness are really quite related. He is an endearing, uncomplicated man of taste, penetration, and feeling. He has almost none of the catty-cleverness of many of his Irish colleagues. He has retained an infectious zest for literature. He is a good man. But with one or two uncharacteristic exceptions, such as Thomas l\duskerry, he is a quiet writer whose emotions are mild and whose techniques are simple. He seems better over the short haul, and a long prose narrative, such as Castle Conquer or The Flying Swans, seems to over-extend him. He comes off creditably but not memorably. Without technical com- plexity for criticism to sink its teeth into, and usually without strong emotional quality, his work tends to get overshadowed by the most obviously dramatic work of often more uneven writers. Nevertheless, now that he is a Grand Old Man, attention must be finally paid, and Zack Bowen's short book pays it very creditably. Actually, criticizing this "Biographical-Critical Introduction" has some of the same difficulties as criticizing the work of Colum himself. The book is simple, lucid, generally helpful and accurate in its facts, and generally just and precise in its judgments. I noticed only one minor factual error, and I would only mildly quibble with the downgrading of the early long plays and the upgrading of The Flying Swans. It is a quiet book, unobtrusive, perceptive and useful; and that undoubtedly is as it should be, for those same valuable qualities have been Padraic Colum's for over seventy years. E Bowen, Zack.

London: Calder and Boyars, 1970.176 pp. + illus. 35/-. Several years ago Dr. Bernard Meyer wrote a psychoanalytic biography of "Joseph Conrad" in which certain compulsive themes and imbalances in the fiction of that writer were traced back to inadequacies in the man Conrad-ne-Korzeniowski. Dr. Meyer summoned a good deal of evidence to show that the man had more than the usual allotment of neurotic ten- dencies and insisted in particular on his inadequacies as husband and father. According to the psychiatrist, Conrad's marriage in middle-age only compounded his feelings of insecurity and guilt: he was a hypochondriac with latent homosexual tendencies, a domestic tyrant, and a man so emotionally immature that he jealously resented the biFth of his sons. Reviewing Dr. Meyer's book in Modern Fiction Studies (Summer 1967) we questioned the easy equation of man with writer and argued that whatever neurotic tendencies the man may have shown, his fiction might better be seen not as a reflection of personality, but its transcendence. We still hold to that conviction what would be left of Marcel Proust or his work after a Dr. Meyer's close scrutiny? but we had no reason to question the validity of the doctor's description of Conrad as family man. Now that has changed. Borys, the elder of Conrad's two sons, has written an engaging memoir of life with father that would seem to con- tradict Dr. Meyer in almost all respects. Borys admits that his father was sometimes austere and occasionally short-tempered, but even as a young child Borys seems to have realized that those moments were usually the result of the painful gout from which Conrad suffered and most of the time stoically endured. The almost complete absence of filial reverence and the steadfast refusal to over-romanticize his famous father that dis- tinguish Borys' reminiscences help to convince us of the truthfulness of the portrait. It may indeed, in more senses than one, be a wise child who knows his own father, and no doubt the passing years help to mellow any son's memories of his parents, but there is a down-to-earth quality about this little book that makes it seem trustworthy. 752</page><page sequence="47">Like many another son of genius, Borys seems to have been more interested in machines than in books, and he remembers with particular vividness the motor-cars owned by his father and their sometimes amus- ing misadventures with those erratic vehicles. Here, for example, is an account of one of Borys' homecomings from school which testifies to the son's affectionate, if irreverent regard for his master mariner of a father: On one occasion he was unable to come and fetch me so I made the journey by train and arrived at our local station to find no one there to meet me. As I stood waiting by my kit-bag I baw our car coming fast down the steep hill at the foot of which the station was situated. It swung into the entrance at such a high speed as to lift the inner wheels clear of the ground; my Father was at the wheel arrayed in his usual motoring costume, and I could distinctly see the glitter of his monocle. My alarm, and disap- proval of his reckless driving, gave way to complete bewilderment when he made no attempt to stop, but swept around the station yard at the same breakneck speed, waving to me cheerfully en passant, and disap- peared in the direction of home. Abandoning my kit-bag, I ran out into the road to find the car backed into the grass bank some way up the hill with my Father standing beside it coolly lighting a cigarette. As I arrived breath- less at his side he greeted me casually: "Hello, Boy. This damned thing took charge of me and I was quite unable to bring it to anchor. You had better have a look at it." As I prepared to crawl underneath the vehicle, he added: "Take your jacket off first or it will become smothered in grease." As soon as I had re-attached the brake cable which had come adrift, we climbed in and, after recovering my kit-bag, set off for home in silence and he never made any subsequent comment upon the event. William Faulkner, we suspect, could have made more of that story than Dr. Meyer. Lee, Robert F. CONRAD'S COLONIALISM. Studies in English Literature, No. 54. The Hague: Mouton, 1969 distributed by Humanities Press. 148 pp. $8.25. Reviewed by WILFRED STONE, Stanford University To write a book about Conrad with the single-minded purpose of showing that Conrad believed in imperialism, the White Man's Burden, the innate superiority of Anglo-Saxons to other Europeans, and the irresistible desire of blacks and browns everywhere to be dominated by the white races, is not a very easy job. Part of what makes it hard is that most of these claims are untrue. Though Conrad's attitude towards the colonial enter- prise especially the British was somewhat less than clear-cut, it is probably fair to say that he never used the word "progress" except with ironic intent, and in one of his Last Essays he made the unambiguous statement that the imperialistic enterprise was "the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience and geographi- cal exploration." It is hard, too, because in order to write such a book you virtually have to ignore the fact that Conrad was primarily an artist! a compassionate student of the individual human predicament, and not a political propagandist with a racist stripe. 753</page><page sequence="48">JOSEPH CONRAD In spite of the difficulty of this job, Robert F. Lee in Conrad's Co10nial- ism rises to it. Throughout his unusual book, he evinces almost no interest in Conrad as a writer, but merely uses Conrad as a peg on which to hang his own racial and political prejudices. He also evinces an almost total disregard for what most critical writers would call evidence and truth. Lee, in short, is not an ordinary critic; he is more of a prophet. He has access to insights a lot of us do not, since he has quite literally travelled in Conradian realms to an extent far beyond the ordinary. He has lived more than nine years in the Orient (Philippines, China, Japan, Hawaii, Okinawa, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, Egypt, and Burma) and hence knows Orientals. He has lived in the American South (though, unlike Conrad he has not apparently been in Africa) and hence knows Blacks. These experiences have taught him many things. He knows, for example, that Blacks and Orientals are hypochondriacs and malingerers ("in the Orient and in the South of the U.S.A.... 'mistries' is a frequent excuse for irresponsibility" and this well-known fact is, of course, illustrated by James Wait in The Nigger of the "Narcissus." When he draws on back- ground knowledge like this, Lee does become, in his own way, a literarv critic. He helps us to see, for example, that Wait was a "demoralizing" force not because he was a suffering individual who evoked more pity than the ship's community could bear, but simply because the crew forgot that he was a "nigger" and "became obsessed with the miscon- ception of his equality." In another place Mr. Lee points out that "restraint" among Orientals is not, as with the British, "an inborn phase of character," but a mere "practice of courtesy." (The Rescue is the recommended reading hereO) This, of course, goes along with the Oriental's well-known tendencies towards hypocrisy, evasiont and cheating. Once again Mr. Lee points out (in a gloss on An Outcast of the Islands) that "the deficiency of open courage in the Oriental outside of the Japanese area which prevents him-absolutely unarmed-from standing by himself, makes the knife a fitting symbol for his fighting tactics." The "open courage" referred to is a fight between Lingard and Willems, two drunken white men. Has Lee forgotten the abject cowardice of such whites as Kayerts and Carlier in "An Outpost of Progress't or the stoic heroism of such Malays as Arsat and his brother in "The Lagoon"? One wonderst because Lee makes a great deal of the fighting attitude as a test of character, and it doesn't always appear that he has read everything Conrad wrote. One wonders, too, what Lee would say about the fighting abilities of the North Viet- namese over the past twenty years? The answer is, of course, that Mr. Lee sees only what he wants to see; and one of the consequences is a misreading of Conrad so gross as to be, at times, simply ludicrous. Has any other critic, for example, ever viewed Charles Gould of Nostromo as the hero of that book, or as a man Conrad particularly wanted us to admire? Mr. Lee is, I think, the pioneer here. He sees as deeply admirable "the Anglo-Saxon commercial influence on the politics and personal life in a non-European country," and sees no irony at all in Conrad's referring to Charles Gould as the idealist of the "Material Interest." Lee has apparently done very little reading of other critics (though he takes some badly aimed pot-shots at 754</page><page sequence="49">Albert Guerard), and I think he should. He could profit by a remark like the following by Eloise Knapp Hay, for example: "Gould is not God or the devil dealing out the choice, or tempting the man. He is Nostromo's doubie as well as the initiator of his fall. That is to say, Gould's corruption is the model for Nostromo's, and Gould himself is an Adam, disturbing creation in the 'paradise of snakes' where the mine slept until he resolved to use it for human salvation. Evil (one cannot tell about good, since there's very little of it in the novel) is exterior and is not, even, moral. The evil is the silver."-The Political Novels of Joseph Conrad (Chicago, 1963), p. 183. Gould's "corruption"? Silver "evil"? Lee, one feels sure, has never heard of such nonsense. But he does make one very original point: Holroyd, the San Francisco financier who wants to be a silent partner in the mine and not share in the responsibility, helps to tell us what is wrong with our own foreign policy. "In the United States's relations with other coun- tries and nations, with its 'aid' to this one and its 'aid' to that one, it has tended to contribute nothing but exactly what Holroyd contributes- money." Lee is a conservative and a believer in sound business practices, and it is clearly a great sadness to him that the British Empire didn't work out. It's a puzzle as to why this happened, too, since in one place he em- phasizes the "East's constant and willing awaiting instruction from the West" and in another "the lack of gratitude and appreciation by the East for the genuine benefits derived from the white man." Well, it's like the bumper sticker says, sometimes "pragmatism doesn't work." Still, it's too bad we end this book so confused, because Lee promised at the beginning that as we went on we would understand more and more clearly what Conrad meant by the redeeming "idea" in imperialism. Part of the problem may be that some of Mr. Lee's sentences are hard to understand. Take this one, for instance: "Forced by the drive of his own instincts, the white man, even when not asked, must accept the responsibility of aiding and guiding the dependent peoples even though he knows there will never be any genuine reward other than his own realization of carrying out the dictates of his destiny." (Is that the "idea"?) Or this? "The Orient has already refuted its relations with Great Britain in many ways indicative of mental operations somewhat beyond Western rational understanding." Or this, where Mr. Lee is discussing "Karain: A Memory"? Conrad's observation, "very little more pressing was needed to make him swerve over into the form of madness peculiar to his race," is given added gravity when we consider that as recently as the turn of the century the U.S. Army automatic pistol was developed for the purpose of stopping these warriors, since no other fire-arm could immediately bring them down, even when often they were shot through the heart. Lee seems very impressed with the way white masters in the East beat up their servants, and he makes a special point of telling us how much the servants appreciate it. It is in pointing out such things that Lee is 755</page><page sequence="50">JOSEPH CONRAD unique as a critic. Some of us might read Conrad thinking that servants have feelings just like other people, but Lee sets us straight. The lower orders more than anything want to know their place and be kept in it. That is their happiness. It was Conrad's greatness to know this sort of thing instinctively and to reveal it to us that is, if we know how to read him. As Lee says: "Since it is often difficult to determine what a writer says, consciously or unconsciously, if he is extremely symbolic, complex, or dealing in unfamiliar backgrounds, we are forced to expend some energy in meditating on his works." Lee does spend this energy, as any good critic should, and what we get is a revealing picture of the inside of Lee's mind. If there is anything wrong with this book, this is it. We learn a lot about Lee, but almost nothing about Conrad. And in the process we learn just how hard Conrad is for some people to read. Randall, Dale B. J.

Cambridge University Press, 1969. 222 pp. $9.50. Reviewed by FREDERICK R. KARL, The City College of the City University of New York These are well-edited and welcome books. Although the Randall study, based chiefly on the first publication of 58 Conrad letters, will have little general appeal for the letters in themselves are not top rung it should be attractive to students of the period and, more particularly, to Conrad scholars. The Watts edition of letters to Cunninghame Graham, however, demonstrates Conrad in top form and deserves wider attention. For here, both writers, even when their ideas and ideals appear com- pletely divergent, are sensitively attuned to each other's mind. More of this later. These editions come at a rather crucial time in Conrad scholarship. Critical studies have, of course, continued to appear, among them Edward Said's Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography (1966), Norman Sherry's Conrad's Eastern World (1966), Claire Rosenfield's Paradise of Snakes: An Archetypal Analysis of Conrad's Political Novels (1967), Avrom Fleishman's Conrad's Politics: Community and Anarchy in The Fiction of loseph Conrad (1967), Bernard Meyer's Joseph Conrad: A Psychoanalytic Biography (1967), J. I. M. Stewart's loseph Conrad (1968). Of these, only the study by Meyer, and to some extent the Sherry book, breaks new ground and justifies itself. The others involve, chiefly, a re-arrangement of known material or the creation of a position that at no time required a full-length study. Monographs could have sufficed for the points made by Fleishman, Rosenfield, and Said. The Stewart book would have been dated twenty years ago. Most of these publications, clearly resulting from the proliferation of doctoral dissertations and the expansion of university presses, do not demonstrate any great urgency. Edward Said's book, orig- inally a Harvard dissertation, is perhaps the worst offender, for his point of view is based on a close analysis of Conrad's correspondence, and yet Said does not appear to have utilized the more than 1000 unpublished letters held in this country and in England. 756</page><page sequence="51">Except for psychoanalytic studies, already carried forward handily by Moser and Meyer, and Polish studies, now being mined by Zdzislaw Najder, there are at present only two areas left for Conrad scholars and critics: textual studies of his manuscripts and typescripts-most of which are in American libraries- and close examination of unpublished letters. Textual studies of a comparative nature of MS, TS, and published text have as yet been rudimentary; but they should, ultimately, throw the stress back on Conrad's development as an artist, where the emphasis belongs. Similarly, the letters will reveal new aspects of Conrad's way of working and thinking, as these two editions show, and suggest new emphases. If nothing else, scrutiny of the letters will preclude that kind of narrow "thesis" study which satisfies dissertation mentors who are not up on the material. Since doctoral mentors are not insisting on the investigation of unpublished material, such theses, based on hunches or insights worthy of an article, not a book, are now swamping the field, not only in Conrad studies, but throughout the contemporary area. With this in mind, the Watts and Randall editions are doubly welcome. Dale Randall's task was the more difficult, for he had to reconstruct for us a rather strange southern patrician named Francis Warrington Dawson, Jr., whose chief interests were to garner recognition as a writer and curry favor with the great. Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Dawson was an international journalist, a friend of Teddy Roosevelt, a Negrophobe, a struggling novelist, and a not so repressed homosexual reminiscent of Baron Corvo and Marcel Proust. By 1910, when Conrad and Dawson met, Conrad was an established novelist of the first rank, while Dawson, then 32, yearned after a literary career. The relationship and correspondence were obviously one-sided. Dawson fawned upon the older writer, hoping that some of the latter's greatness would be reflected upon him. At the same time, while Conrad was gouty and depressed, he made himself useful, helping out with Jessie and the children. When Dawson entered Conrad's life, the latter was more disposed to adulation than to deep friendship. Under these conditions, Curle, Jean- Aubry, and Hugh Walpole followed in the next few years. On the other hand, Cunninghame Graham swam into Conrad's ken at a time when both were sensing their talents and trying out their powers, during the great years of Conrad's development up to Nostromo. By 1910, when Dawson appeared, the original force was gone, Conrad felt himself old, was a sickly, neurotic 53, and needed consolation for so little financial reward after so much devotion to craft. Dawson was there, as Galsworthy and Garnett earlier, to bolster his ego, assure him of a following, and afford him some continuity with the buzzing world from which Conrad so often retreated in horror and illness. The letters that Conrad wrote to Dawson, then, did not come from the center of his creative powers; rather, they are solicitous and full of the kind of generous praise that signalled his indifference to Dawson's work. There is, nevertheless, one fine letter that Randall rightly makes the centerpiece of his edition. Here, Conrad sets forth a credo not dissimilar to the Nigger Preface fifteen years earlier: "The soundness of art is not the soundness of a game. Suffering is an attribute [ ,] almost a condition of greatness, of devotion, of an altogether self-forgetful sacrifice to that remorseful fidelity to the 757</page><page sequence="52">IOSEPH CONRAD truth of his own sensations at whetever [sic] cost of pain or contumely which for me is the whole Credo of the artist" (June 20, 1913). Conrad's response was to the "14 points" of Dawson's Fresh Air Art Society, devoted to cleansing the atmosphere of an unwholesome and decadent modernism. How sadly Dawson misread Conrad's disenchant- ment with modernism, how completely he failed to see that Conrad's disillusionment with the contemporary scene sustained his sense of con- flict, as it did Proust's, indeed fed his art and was ultimately translated into individual forms and techniques. My sole quarrel with Professor Randall's evaluation of the material- which he always handles with a discriminating awareness of the dis- proportion between the correspondents derives from his tendency to defend Dawson's literary imagination and artistic sensitivity. Randall prints the carbons of some Dawson letters, and frequently they are simply incoherent (for example, see Oct. 17, 1911). Also, Dawson was not a "mama's boy," but almost a Faulknerian caricature of the southern gen- tleman. His homosexuality would appear to be a more important factor in his overall frustration than Randall grants, and as well more connected to his whole career than is conceded. Similarly, the entire question of why Conrad at this time sought or accepted "softness" and "inferiority" is of some interest as part of the psychic drama that every serious friend- ship entails. One other quibble: For his commentary, Randall uses pub- lished letters (from Jean-Aubry's Life and Letters) when often the un- published version indicates interesting excised material. Writing to Gals worthy, for example, Conrad follows a neutral comment on Dawson with a phrase Jean-Aubry pointedly omitted: "Very safe bunkum that" (May 31, 1910). The phrase is almost too good. C. T. Watts did not have to be defensive about Cunninghame Graham While not a writer of the first rank, Graham was secure in his views as a humanitarian socialist, led an active, fruitful life, and, despite some tem- porary depression, for the most part remained faithful to his vision of life and art. Almost diametrically opposed to Conrad's views, Graham was an activist, politically progressive, optimistic; yet the two held mutual respect for each other and used their correspondence to lay out their ideas in detail. Conrad's letters to Graham are perhaps his best, certainly superior to the almost two hundred extant to Galsworthy or the hundred extant to Ford. The correspondence began, on Conrad's side, on August 5, 1897, and proceeded immediately to essentials: statements on Kipling's achievements, the nature of artistic truth, and the pain of personal isolation. Conrad wrote: "Mostof my life has been spent be- tween sky and water and now I live so alone that often I fancy myself clinging stupidly to a derelict planet abandoned by its precious crew." That image, split or expanded, was to be a key to all of his major work. Later, on January 14, 1898, Conrad responded to Graham's political . . progressivism: In a dispassionate view the ardour for reform, improvement for virtue, for knowledge, and even for beauty is only a vain sticking up for appearances as though one were anxious about the cut of one's clothes in a community of blind men. Life knows us not and we do not know life-we don't know 758</page><page sequence="53">even our own thoughts. Half the words we use have no meaning whatever and of the other half each man understands each word after the fashion of his own folly and conceit. Faith is a myth and beliefs shift like mists on the shore; thoughts vanish; words, once pronounced, die; and the memory of yesterday is as shadowy as the hope of to-morrow only the string of my platitudes seems to have no end. Fifty-two of these letters have appeared in Jean-Aubry's edition, but with major omissions and innumerable errors. Twenty-eight are published for the first time. Using other primary sources, for example the Graham letters to Edward Garnett, housed at Texas, Watts has given us extremely fine notes, although on occasion with an enthusiastic excess of detail. Both books show sensitivity to the textual problems of editing, surely a quality much needed in the establishment of serious Conrad studies. Watts presents the text as is and provides descriptive notes in a separate commentary. Randall, on the other hand, makes minor corrections of punctuation and grammar in the text itself. Both methods are unobtrusive and skillfully carried through, but once corrections are to be made, an editor must respond to all errors and Randall often neglects Conrad's considerable inaccuracies in French. But these are minor matters indeed. Conrad studies have been enriched by necessary work well done. B Ryf, Robert S. JOSEPH CONRAD. Columbia Essays on Modern Writers, No. 49.

YANNELLA Professor Butterfield's book follows closely the publication of critical studies of Crane's poetry by R. W. B. Lewis (1967) and Herbert J. Leibowitz (1968) and the biography of John Unterecker, Voyager (1969). Unfortunately, The Broken Arc does not greatly extend or amplify our knowledge of Crane; in a sense, in fact, it repeats much of what Lewis and Leibowitz established. This is not Butterfield's fault. Rather, it is the case of a competent critic coming to certain conclusions at approxi- mately the same time as others (Butterfield completed his study in 1967). There are differences, of course, and The Broken Arc will have to be consulted by serious students of Crane. There are instances too when Butterfield seems far more careful in his readings than previous critics. For instance, his analyses of Crane's early poems are quite convincing. But this is not an exciting book. Had it been published in, say, 1965, it would have received a great deal of attention. Coming in 1969, it seems largely redundant. 761</page><page sequence="56">B Clark, David R., ed. THE MERRILL STUDIES IN THE BRIDGE. Columbus, Ohio, 1970.132 pp. $1.75 pb.

Austin, Texas: Roger Beacham, 1968. 176 pp. $8.95. Reviewed by MELVIN E. LYON, University of Nebraska Admirers of the work of Edward Dahlberg must be grateful to Harold Billings for this first critical work on Dahlberg, both for its contents and for the influence it will have in furthering its subject's increasing recogni- tion. Such gratefulness should be tempered, however, by a frank avowal of the book's limitations. On the title page Billings describes it as con- sisting of "critical essays." Actually, the "essays" are almost entirely book reviews and prefaces and thus are not "critical" in the sense of being either scholarly or systemically analytical. Instead, they are as in the essays by \\/illiam Carlos Williams, Victor Lipton, and Alfred Kazin- usually brief, impressionistic, though often acute, comments on indi- vidual works or brief overviews of Dahlberg's work as a whole. Williams' excellent remarks excepted, the most satisfying essays in the collection are those which do move toward full-length treatment: Paul Carroll's selective overview, Josephine Herbst's excellent discussion of Because I Was Flesh, and Joseph Evans Slate's excellent study of The Sorrows of Priapus and the bestiary tradition the only essay which, while expli- 763</page><page sequence="58">EDWARD DAHLBERG cating a single work, also explores in depth its relationship to that con- text of tradition central to Dahlberg's later writing. The book's critical usefulness is also limited by the fact that all but one of the essays were written between 1958 and 1967, and, more signifi- cantly, by their unanimously laudatory tone. Here and there in the remarks of J. C. Williams, Allen Tate, Lipton, and Herbst an adverse note is sounded, but only in Kazin's essay is this not obliterated by praise. The editor's purpose seems to have been primarily not critical but promo- tional. At the present moment promotion is probably what Dahlberg's work needs most, but such a purpose limits the book's value as criticism. The book does have a positive critical value, however. If it demon- strates that Dahlberg criticism is only beginning, it also gives us some excellent examples of those beginnings and thus makes many of the points from which a mature criticism must start. Such maturity cannot begin until one pervasive point in the book is modified: the insistence that Dahlberg's work is unique in its age. On the contrary, his later work seems to be typically "modern" (using the term to mean especially work written between World War I and the Korean War) both in its ideas and its techniques. Since he stopped writing naturalistic novels in the mid-thirties Dahlberg's key problem has been what is perhaps the key problem of twentieth-century literature: how to escape the trap of pessimistic naturalism if neither traditional religion nor romantic naturism have anything left to offer. In his search for an answer Dahlberg allies himself in one aspect of his work with the twentieth-century romantic primitivists D. H. Lawrence and Sherwood Anderson, for example by viewing nature as good, opposing it to the science and technology-the over-rationality of industrial civilization, and urging men to prefer the vitality of the former to the latter's sterility. Yet on another side of his work Dahlberg sees nature, including human nature, as harsh and destructive, and insists that a worthwhile life requires an imaginativq transformation of the world and strict self-discipline. In embracing this attitude, he belongs with the humanistic strain in twentieth- century literature represented by Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Henry . . james, anc even lot's The Waste Land. Sometimes these two aspects of his work seem incongruous, even contradictory. Together, however and they occur so in Because I Was Flesh they suggest that man ought to admit and live in terms of the fact that he is a physical creaturc an animal--but recognize also that his uniqueness as an animal lies in his ability to be both better and worse than other animals. His superiority consists in his ability to imaginatively transform the world by means of myth and fable and then discipline his nature through reason and will to the service of the ideals engendered by that transformation. The central myth for Dahlberg is that of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, who for him represent the eternally inseparable spirit and flesh. Unlike Robert Frost's modulation of eighteenth and nineteenth cen- tury pastoralism or Wallace Stevens' private meditation, but like T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and James Joyce, Dahlberg seeks to achieve such imaginative transformation by finding in the past a means of giving form and meaning to life in the present. If he urges man to be natural, he also urges him to be traditional, to do as Dante did in The Divine 764</page><page sequence="59">Comedy, not try to be original but go to the past for a guide. His principal artistic technique in his masterpiece, Because I Was F1esh, is essentially the same mythical method described by Eliot in his famous review as characteristic of Joyce's Ulysses and used by himself in The Waste Land. Moreover, Dahlberg creates the same ironic effects in his juxtaposition of the Biblical Hagar-lshmael story (and other allusions) with the mundane lives of Lizzie and her son as Joyce and Eliot create with similar juxtapositions in their works. In his refusal to draw an absolute antithesis between the natural and the disciplined man Dahlberg seems closer to the Ezra Pound of the Cantos. His recurrent attack on homosexuality is also analogous in its combination of emotional obsessiveness and intricate rational justification to Pound's more pervasive concern with usury: in each case the writer sees life values being perverted by abstract values, views the evil he emphasizes in relation to man's relationships with other human beings, and sees it as a corruption of such relationships. This concern, in turn, is one manifestation of a basic difference between Dahlberg and Pound: Pound's primary alliance with the classical tradition, supplemented by the secular oriental tradition of Confucius, and Dahlberg's secularized alliance with the Hebrew tradition, especially the Old Testament prophets. Yet both writers are primarily motivated by moral revulsion against con- temporary civilization and by the dream of recovering a lost paradise in which man and nature are once more in harmony. In addition, essential characteristics of the style of both are a predilection for concrete particu- lars and a rational discontinuity which forces the reader to make imagina- tive leaps to gain meaning. Different from Pound and from Dahlberg's own Old Testament tradition and closer to Ulysses is the humor, often bawdy, always earthy in its perspective, which at his best accompanies Dahl- berg's denunciations, exhortations, and imaginative creations. Such likenesses suggest that Dahlberg is very much of his age. How then explain his long critical neglect? One reason would seem to be his use of non-belletristic forms. The New Critics considered such forms and all didacticism non-literary. Because I Was Flesh was more favorably received because it appeared at a time when the New Criticism had ceased to be critical orthodoxy and yet somewhat paradoxicallwas beginning to be applied to non-belletristic works. The high critical acclaim for Because I Was Flesh helped arouse interest in the other later works. Insofar as the latter have retained such interest, however, it is in part because their moral didacticism, especially as regards the relationship between man and the state, is harmonious with the moral idealism of a politically oriented decade. Moreover, the same decade which has redis- covered the essays of Emerson as wisdom literature after the New Critics had tended to dismiss him in terms of the Matthiessen-James formula that he was an artist who failed to find his form also finds something congenial in the very different wisdom literature of Edward Dahlberg.

Their claim of a first may be debatable - much the same sort of technique forms the basis of Charles Otson Reading at Berkeley (San Francisco, 1966) but there can be no doubt that the tape-recorder is here proven to be a useful instrument for literary studies.

EMILY DICKINSON AND RIDDLE. Northern Illinois Uni- versity Press, 1969. 152 pp. $4.95. Reviewed by CHARLES R. METZGER, University of Southern California It would be easy, as it is perhaps unavoidably necessary, to suggest merely that Mrs. Lucas' book appears suspiciously like a prize M.A. thesis which somehow got printed by a fledgling university press. For it con- tains the familiar preliminary survey of scholarship and criticism. It is marked by transitions, particularly some of those introducing quoted passages, that are abrupt to the point of puzzlement. The writing itself is marred by distressing cliches, i.e. people "throwing down gauntlets,' etc. But it wouldn't be fair to suggest this merely. Despite its superficial weaknesses, Mrs. Lucas' is a sane, intelligent, and useful book. It is likely to prove more useful to lay readers, to beginning scholars, more refreshing to old hands, than many a dissertation that has been accepted on the subject, than many a book published by estab- lished presses. In surveying the scholarship and criticism Mrs. Lucas demonstrates that she is aware of the whopping assumptions, of the fatuous interpretations, advanced by some of her ingenuous predecessors, and she doesn't buy them. Starting from the position that others before her have arrived at in conclusion, Mrs. Lucas proceeds to consider the riddle of Emily Dickin- son's poetry, the riddle of her social and psychic circumstances, against the background of the history of riddle poetry in Western culture, of its public and private functions, both for the poet and for his audience. Working against this background, Mrs. Lucas suggests the probable im- portance of childhood riddles, along with the almost forgotten traditions and mysteries of semi-public dying at home, in Miss Dickinson's early experience. She then goes on to document the riddles as letters, as poems, as poem about "The Riddle," which Miss Dickinson wrote. She discusses the riddle poem as a special form of wit (without using the term wit), i.e. as complex metaphor. She discusses the "offensive- defensive" function of the riddle poem, as a form of what Freud called "tendency wit" (again without using Freud's expression). I suppose that what I am suggesting is that Mrs. Lucas' book brings up a number of really important issues and deals with them intelligently, 767</page><page sequence="62">even if a bit briefly.

Twayne's World Authors Series, No. 87. New York, 1969. 156 pp. $4.95. Reviewed by VIOLET KETELS. In the work of Friedrich Durrenmatt one and one may make twot or then again three or four, or more. But not necessarily. The point about Diurren- matt is that even his paradoxes can be paradoxical, which is to say, merely logical. Beyond a certain point different laws apply in logic as in physics when it pushes from general to nuclear properties, a postulate Durren- matt employs with cunning willfulness to challenge and unsettle his audience. His ambiguity and contradictoriness are what make his work exciting and part of the contemporary mode even when his form seems traditional. In his case the chronological citation of works, the sum- maries of plots, the identification of themes, even quotations from the author himself, in short the traditional survey approach of Murray B. Peppard's workmanlike study does not capture the mind of the man or the core of his art. They are revealed in the richness of irony and inter- connection, in the metaphoric significance of the plays as dramatic action, which may be very different from the significance inferrable from the language of the printed page taken at face value. Peppard's admirable factual accuracy and straightforward clarity are simply too bland to represent the writer who, with Max Frisch, has been called, "the most 770</page><page sequence="65">consistently interesting and significant dramatist writing today," who is in Swiss letters an outrageous rebel precisely because, in spite of his avowed penchant for privacy, he does not separate his art from his life. T. S. Eliot was right in his observation that a new work of art modifies everything that existed before it. In view of Durrenmatt's activity and creativity of the last year or two his involvement in the Basler Theater as advocatus diaboli (in which role he affirmed and sought to implement as necessary a connection between theater and the political and economic mise en scene, in which association he was the motivating force toward commitment of the theater to social and political relevance), the premiere productions of his Play Strindberg and King John, the newest version of The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi, the projected plot of Portrait of a Planet, which combines cannibalism, world hunger and a planetary president, his political involvement (using the Basler Theater as platform he, Gunter Grass, Kurt Marti and others scored the Russian invasion of Czechoslo- vakia), his impudent thrusts at the Swiss bourgeois establishment Durren- matt's oeuvre takes on a different character and focus. Surely a writer's work is not totally distinct from his life and its meaning. The aesthetics and politics of Theater-problem are not, as Peppard judges, inconsistent with Durrenmatt's subsequent practice. In retrospect the plays and novels gradually disclose as entelechy what the essay predicates: the monstrous bureaucratic madness of a world divided between the powerful and their victims, an economic radicalism that would make Marxism the handmaiden of Christianity and vice versa, and religion as a construction that tries to make sense of a world not divinely ordered, but tacking and veering absurdly in response to the process of its own mysterious existence. Peppard's study is weakened by the absence of both psychological and economic perceptiveness. As to religion, "the possibility of private sal- vation" is so rarely demonstrated in the plays and novels that it is mis- leading to cite it as a correlative to Durrenmatt's negative conclusions about the public sphere where disorder and conflict of grotesque pro- portions abide. The concept God for Durrenmatt is a "conscious fiction," which man creates as he creates the figure pi to measure a circle. In neither case can the reality of the concept be determined. They are prac- tical adjustments, tools for establishing order, not evidence of eternal Wisdom. To say of Durrenmatt that he has a deep religious faith in God and the possibility of divine grace is to trust the teller, not the tale; his longing, not his reality; the language, not the action in his art. Durrenmatt's favorite analogy of the chess game, construed so that a knight can behave like a bishop when the logic of play shifts, is a good one for the adaptive dynamism and insecurity Durrenmatt assigns to the human condition. That sense of perverse unpredictability, once grasped as an a priori in Durrenmatt, shakes Peppard's central conclusions. The most troublesome is the judgment that "in all of Durrenmatt's mature works, serenity of soul is coupled with the acceptance of death and an insight into the fundamental, if inscrutable, justice of the world order and the rightness of God's universe, including the final judgment of death." Perhaps Romulus achieves some serenity, but surely 111 of The Visit does not. IDbelohe, at the end of The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi, still shouting defiantly at the world's ravening windmills, is a battered fool, not the 771</page><page sequence="66">wise old man of philosophic mind. Schwitter in The Meteor ends as a grotesque ancient, screaming for death above the evangelistic hymnsing- ing of the Salvation Army. Even the glorious affirmation in It Is Written is undercut by the "bizarre nature of the whole final scene," as Peppard himself points out. The tone of Peppard's book is so objective and careful that it conveys an image of Durrenmatt the author as a comfortable burgher, seeing universal chaos with a well tempered equanimity that may be partially true of the man, but not at all of the shaping imagination behind the work. It does not deal with the question of why Durrenmatt's stories do not end until they "have taken the worst possible turn." It does not account for the anger in Durrenmatt's mockery of human pretensions and brutalities, nor for the desperate corrosiveness of his laughter. It does not suggest the possibility that paradox and mathematical precision may be swift, hot anger, the freezing of passion, not its absence. It misses the dimension of a man's struggling with life in his work. Perhaps a survey should be broad rather than deep, and not infused with eccentric enthusi- asms. Certainly this one supplies a factually unassailable tour of the territory, a useful introduction to its subject. One regrets, however, the appearance of authority and finality conferred by a hard cover. C Geiger, Richard Allen. Eschatology in the Dramas of Friedrich Durrenmatt. Louisiana State, 1969, Adolf E.

London: Methuen, 1970. 200 pp. Distributed in United States by Barnes and Noble at $2.50, pb. In this study Professor Blamires provides a detailed interpretation of the Four Quartets, a poem designated as "post-Joycean in that it fully reckons with the thematic development of verbal overtones which is characteristic of Ulysses." The complex themes of the poem, its allusiveness and its abundant reverberations are elucidated. The study is divided into four parts, each of which is concerned with one of the Quartets; in addition, there are three appendices which provide commentaries on key subjects. Necessarily, Blamires at times reconsiders certain words, lines, and pas- sages in the light of later developments in the poem, so that a total reading of Word Unheard is inevitable if one is to fully comprehend the author's conclusions. Nor, we are told, can readers of the Quartets appre- ciate its meanings without attention to Eliot's constant reconsiderations, his development through elaboration of previously considered ideas and phrases. As Blamires says, "The poem is about echoes; the poem utilizes echoes; the poem is echoes." A Gallup, Donald. T. S. ELIOT: A BIBLIOGRAPHY. Revised and Expanded Edition. Harcourt, Brace and World, 1969. 414 pp. $10. Reviewed by LEO HAMALIAN, California Institute of the Arts The Times Literary Supplement of May 3, 1970, opens its review of this book with a statement taken from the dust-jacket: "The first edition of Professor Gallup's bibliography appeared in 1952, and was at once ac- claimed for its exemplary thoroughness and clarity." Though the words of praise (in turn quoted from the TLS review of the "first" edition) re- quire no qualification for the present edition, the first part of the state- ment does. Actually Gallup prepared a primitive version of this book in 1937, and ten years later expanded that catalogue into a 128 page check- list brought out by the Yale University Library, where Gallup is the Curator of American Literature. Thus, the present volume may be thought of as a fourth edition revised, enlarged, and re-styled after the increas- ingly sophisticated standards of bibliography created by Gallup's own work on Ezra Pound and Warren Roberts' impeccable reference on D. H Lawrence, both of which appeared in 1963. Regarded in this light, the new book culminates more than thirty years of steady interest in the writings of the man who revolutionized modern poetry, transformed the art of literary criticism, and reformed the poetic drama. For the general reader, the book is a reminder of the long shadow that Old Possum cast over Anglo-American letters for more than three generations. It catalogues and annotates the diversity of his concerns and the dynamics of his poetic development, both of which were to influence literary taste and critical attitudes of our time. The book mir- rors, in its minutiae no less than in the classics listed under category 773</page><page sequence="68">T. S. ELIOT A ("books and pamphlets by T. S. Eliot"), and category B ("books and pamphlets with contributions"), the long and prolific career of a poet who achieved the status of an "international hero" the best phrase Delmore Schwartz could find to describe Eliot's elevation to eminence after being awarded the Nobel Prize. On the evidence of the greatly expanded category D ("translations into foreign languages"), one must conclude that this aspect of his figure "the international hero"-has grown more impressively since 1952 than his reputation as a creative writer or as an influential essayist in English. His work now appears in 38 languages (it was 15 in 1947), including Malayan, Oriya, Tamil, Urdu, and Yiddish. The number of translations into Arabic is much greater than the seven entries listed. Any bookstore in Cairo or Beirut (Kryat's in particular) will reveal the respect his name commands among educated Middle Easterners. The Russians, on the other hand, have done nothing since the early poems (one translator, Nina Berberova, is now teaching at Princeton), and until the Gorki Institute decides to improve matters, Soviet readers will remain ignorant of The Quartets, the plays, and the essays. Furthermore, if Gallup's volume also goes untranslated, Soviet readers will never know that Eliot was reading Giordano Bruno before Joyce was (New Statesman, Oct. 21, 1916), that he first used the signature "T. S. Eliot" in the International Journal of Ethics (July 1917), that he lambasted Amy Lowell for neglecting Ezra Pound in her study of American Poetry, that he was into Amerindian songs and dances before D. H. Lawrence (Athaenaeum, Oct. 7, 1919), that he recognized the genius of Igor Stra- vinsky and Marianne Moore before their names were known even to American intellectuals, that he opposed Fascism as early as 1928, that he was victimized by the notorious literary pirate Sam Roth, and that he was impressed enough by Joseph Wood Krutch to sign one of his poems ("The Song of the Opherian," deleted from The Waste Land) with the pseudonym of "Gus Krutzsch." Without Gallup's assistance, Eliot scholars and collectors would have to stumble by accident upon many of the master's contributions to ob- scure periodicals (Catacomb, Nine, Adam, Church Times, Jhe Christian News-letter) and upon many of the translations newly listed in this edi- tion (there is a Welsh translation of Murder in the Cathedral called "Ladd wrth yr allor," a title that sounds like a line from Robert Creeley). We learn where to locate Eliot manuscripts (The Houghton Library, the Berg Collec- tion of the New York Public Library, and the University of Texas), espe- cially the original typescript of The Waste Land which Gallup described in the TLS for Nov. 7, 1968. Gallup corrects misprints, gives detailed descriptions of first editions, and provides valuable publication and his- torical notes. The Eliot scholar need only to compare the earlier versions with this one to have reaffirmed the patient merit of meticulous and con- tinuing scholarship, especially when it feeds and is fed by the broader currents of literature. Clearly Gallup is no elderly Gradgrind grubbing away in the stacks after the inconsequential. Faced with such fascinating cues for a scholar's passion, why should one cavil over one or two minor omissions? "Son of Man," in the 774</page><page sequence="69">September 1928 issue of The Criterion appears to be Eliot's. And "The Money System," a letter to the Times of April 5, 1934, and his signature (among others) to a second letter on the same subject (May 10, 1934) remind us that Eliot spent many days working at Lloyds Bank in London. Bernard Stambler's score for The Waste Land, available at Barnard College, deserves to be better known. (I note these items dutifully in response to Professor Gallup's general call for errata in his Introduction). One hopes, however, that he will leave further revision to someone elsc "-- surely not much more can be added to this book and will direct his talent towards the work of other writers who deserve similar treatment. Martin, Graham, ed. ELIOT IN PERSPECTIVE: A SYMPOSIUM. Humanities Press, 1970. 306 pp. $10. Reviewed by M. L. ROSENTHAL, New York University It is a half-decade now since Eliotss death, and over a quarter of a century since he completed his serious work as a poet. It is hard for those of us who were nourished on his most compelling poetry, and on a few germinative essays, to accept two realities. The first is that his peculiar variety of open form what some writers like Mr. Graharn Martin and Mr. F. W. Bateson think of as his piecing together of frag- ments (that he should have been "edited't by Ezra Pound in the famous instance of The Waste Land seems to them some sort of clincher)-still appears to puzzle certain critics, especially certain British ones. The second is that the approach of most commentators to Eliot continues to be ideational rather than poetic. A pioneer in the methods that have in fact prevailed in the most interesting contemporary poetry in English, he almost deliberately concealed the fact by a thick if not always rich overlay of cultural, political, and religious ideas and postures. In the United Kingdom, as the obituaries attest, people had for the most part forgotten his American background, which had a great deal to do with the attitudes both toward tradition and toward experiment that he espoused. Several contributors to the collection Eliot in Perspective, a series of essays by various British hands and one CanadianJ find it neces- sary to recall this fact, sometimes in complacent explanation of deficien- cies real and imagined. On Eliot as poet and playwright, the most relevant of these essays are the ones by Francis Scarfe ("Eliot and Nineteenth-Century French Poetry"), Donald Davie ("Pound and Eliot: A Distinction"), lan Hamilton (@'The Waste Land"), Katharine Worth ("Eliot and the Living Theatre"), Richard Woliheim ("Eliot and F. H. Bradley: An Account"), and Terry Eagleton ("Eliot and a Common Culture"). Scarfe is extremely helpful in his sensitive sortings-out of the nuances, echoes, and larger relations in- volved in Eliot's self-tutelage in the French poets. Donald Davie, though he creates some non-existent mysteries and does some quarreling with the obvious, redirects attention to the poet's essentially symbolist method his relation to the "terrorist" process by which the poem's inner movement, the demands of the language on his consciousness, rather than a delimiting purpose or argument, determines its overall character. 775</page><page sequence="70">T. S. ELIOT Davie properly calls attention, by the way, to the "brilliant and momen- tous essay" ("Tennyson and Picturesque Poetry," Essays in Criticism, Vol. 1, No. 3) in which H. M. McLuhan "traced, over the past two centuries of poetic effort, the logic which led the poets to the startling discovery, that they had been observing, in the stories and pictures they created, laws of temporal and spatial arrangement which in fact did not bear upon their activities at all." lan Hamilton seems to be conducting a lover's quarrel (a kind of quarrel, in any case) with Eliot's human sym- pathies and psychological morale-its negative or sterile aspect as part of an argument that criticism has taken too much for granted the justi- fication of everything in the poet's canon, especially The Waste Land. Because he has clearly brooded over the poetry so much himself, it is clear that Hamilton's strictures grow out of a certain empathy an in- volvement with the very tensions that he suggests Eliot made too little room for. Katharine Worth's lively essay is knowledgeable and useful in its consciousness of modern theatre, and of the problems that Eliot faced in this medium. Richard Woliheim's essay, based on a study of Eliot's dissertation, Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley and of two philosophical articles published by the poet in 1916, is written with a special tact and feeling for the ambiguous realm of consciousness that is the true ground of Eliot's poetic reality. The key to his "modernity" seems to be contained in the way he uses a language that manipulates this realm and that is at once psychologically accurate and available to scepticism and faith simultaneously, and Mr. Woliheim helps us see more clearly than before how all this works. So, as it seems to mc though he is more interested in comparing ideas than in applying them to the qualitative nature of the poetry does Mr. Eagleton's excellent comparison of Eliot's conceptions of culture with those of Raymond Williams. Studies of Eliot's religious and general thought, of his career as editor of the Criterion, of the relation of his thinking to Matthew Arnold's, and other significant topics round out the collection. The general level of the essays is high; the authors have paid attention to the more recent infor- mation that has become available, though of course there is a scarcity of the kind of biographical information that is implied in the struggle against severe depression waged in so much of the poetry. Eliot's influence on poetry after him is mentioned not at all, and there is too much easy dismissal of earlier critics who, after all, were making the first soundings as the result of a genuine response to the impact of a great poet. Never- theless, Martin has put together a collection of genuine value. Montgomery, Marion. T. S. ELIOT: AN ESSAY ON THE AMERICAN MAGUS. University of Georgia Press, 1970. 98 pp. $4.50. Reviewed by ALAN HOLDER, Hunter College of City University of New York In the Preface to his slender volume, Marion Montgomery states that he is primarily interested in "the evolution of Eliot's commitment to Christi- 776</page><page sequence="71">anity as reflected in his poetry." While that commitment apparently has great personal significance for Montgomery, his study of its evolution is notably incomplete. The book discusses at length "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," "Gerontion," and Burnt Norton, but offers little or no commentary on the Sweeney poems, The Waste Land, "The Hollow Men," the Ariel poems, "Ash Wednesday," or the last three Quartets. Such large omissions in themselves preclude the demonstration of an "evolution." Thus, we are not given an adequate treatment of Mont- gomery's declared subject, let alone the "dramatic allegory about the spiritual quest of Everyman and Every-civilization" that the book so pretentiously claims to have presented as it draws to a close. Montgomery is not always persuasive in the readings he does offer us. He seems to be saying, for example, that in "Prufrock," the chambers of the sea, the mermaids, the seaweed, are ironically named elements of the social world Prufrock actually inhabits, rather than constituents of a realm he longs for and dreams about (the usual, and better, interpretation of the poem sees them as such dream objects). Moreover, Montgomery sometimes ignores his own warnings that we should not try to read Eliot's earlier works too much in the light of the later ones. So, we find him asserting a connection between the calling of the mermaids in "Prufrock" and the "drawing of this Love and this Calling" in Little Gidding (thereby having the mermaids two ways). He also joins the intimation of the "infinitely gentle/lnfinitely suffering thing" of the "Preludes" to the moment in the rose garden of Burnt Norton. The first of these linkages is extremely dubious, and the second should have been carefully qualified. As might be expected in a study of Eliot, the text is generously sprinkled with the names of other literary figures. Perhaps too generously. The comparisons made on the fly between Eliot and such people as Williams or Stevens or Hemingway or Hawthorne are, at this stage of Eliot criticism, of limited interest. However, while its organization sometimes appears to be playing peek-a-boo with them, the book does focus on the relationships of a telatively few figures to Eliot, namely, Browning, Robin- son, Wordsworth and Keats (along with T. E. Hulme and F. H. Bradley). Contending that Eliot moved from an initial romanticism, Montgomery is especially concerned with comparing Eliot to Keats and Wordsworth. (Unfortunately, the meaning of "romantic" shifts as we move through the book, and at one point Platonism, Puritanism, Pragmatism and Freudianism are all subsumed under that term.) Of particular significance to Montgomery is the distinction between the kind of epiphany he finds in Wordsworth and Keats one that he describes as being bound to a particular experience, failing to transcend time, and leaving an aftermath of doubt as to its authenticity and the mystical moments recorded in the Four Quartets. Those moments bring contact with a timeless, perma- nent, and Christian reality. Montgomery is clearly drawn to such moments, and is condescending in his treatment of Wordsworth and Keats as receivers of inferior epiphanies. He complains of the absence of "any significant height" in The Prelude, and says "Finally, one has quite enough odes from Keats." One trusts that Montgomery speaks only for himself here. Apart from his apparent need to elevate Eliot at the expense of Keats and Wordsworth, Montgomery shows a misunderstanding of the 777</page><page sequence="72">nature of epiphany in Eliot. The sense of some ultimate presence, as experienced in the rose garden of Burnt Norton, does not become for Eliot "resident in the mature mind," as Montgomery claims; it is there for but a moment, set in "the waste sad time/ Stretching before and after." While noting that some of Eliot's own critical remarks strive to put a poet's life and a poet's art asunder, Montgomery is intent on joining them, at least in the case of this particular poet. He contends that Eliot "accepted poetry as being related to his life in a very personal way." From time to time Montgomery alludes to the circumstances of Eliot's life (though without telling us anything new). This reader got the distinct impression that the book Montgomery would really like to have written would have been a biography of Eliot, with the poetry serving to illus- trate a progress toward something approaching sainthood. As it stands, Montgomery's study can be thought of as a hagiography mangue. B Bergonzi, Bernard, ed. T. S. ELIOT: FOUR QUARTETS. Macmillan Casebook Series. London, 1970. 270 pp. 35/- cloth, 13/-pb.

WILLIAM FAULKNER A Kerr, Elizabeth M. YOKNAPATAWPHA: FAULKNER'S "LITTLE POSTAGE STAMP OF NATIVE SOIL." Fordham University Press, 1969. 284 pp. $8.00. Reviewed by WILLIAM ROSSKY In this useful study, Miss Kerr draws, from the novels and from the geography, mores, attitudes, and institutions of Mississippi and the South, a "comprehensive view" of Faulkner's fictive Yoknapatawpha County that illuminates both the author's creation and the factual bases out of which, in part, it germinated. Moving from a general, and perhaps rather familiar, discussion of the organic origin and development of the Yoknapatawpha cycle, shse comes to the heart of her book in the succeeding chapters on geography, on "Caste and Class Society," on "Social I nstitutions and Patterns of Action," then concludes with a comparatively brief discussion of "The Creator and His Creation." Of these divisions, the strongest, the longest, yet most substantially developed and most interesting, are those on "Caste and Class" and "Social Institutions and Patterns of Action." Here Miss Kerr builds an extended series of cogently interrelated segments into a highly informa- tive overview of the society. She explores, for example, the rationalization of slavery by the antebellum paternalism of the pioneering, self-created aristocracy and the rosy distortions of that reality in the post-war Walter Scottism through which poor white identified with upper caste white; tracing segregation from before the Civil War through Reconstruction to the twentieth century, she examines the complex of guilt, fear, pride, and exploitive economics which lay and lies behind the facade of paternal- ism which supplied the rationale not only for slavery but later for segre- gation. The plantation paternalism of slavery is extended, she shows, by the post Civil War one-crop cotton economy, as a McCaslin farm com- missary or a Varner country store monopoly enforces an almost in- escapable debtor peonage upon share-cropper or tenant. The cycles of miscegenation, guilt, and white goddess idolatry, their interrelationships with paternalism and Southern chivalry, and the origins of Faulkner's incest motive in the Southern experience are all taken up and ultimately 780</page><page sequence="75">related to the code in which incest becomes less criminal than miscege- nation. These matters are aptly applied to the fiction, especially to Ab- salom, Absalom! and Sanctuary. Similarly the systematic support of the paternalistic pattern by concepts of family, by established religion, by the legal system, and by politics is carefully developed, again with constant pointed reference to the novels; and the whole is significantly capped by Miss Kerr's discussion of violence in which almost all the preceding pat- terns converge. The entire analysis is buttressed by references to the work of such major students of the South as Myrdal, Cash, DuBois, McGill, Odum, Woodward, and Silver, as well as to that of less familiar but sometimes more scholarly writers. In this, the major part of the book, Miss Kerr has written what is, all in all, the best single, brief yet solid account of the social and institutional patterns which underlie Faulkner's fiction. If she is somewhat less successful with the geography, it is partly because the material for analysis is apparently less plentiful. Her tactic of dividing Faulkner's county into directional quadrants and discussing each in turn, especially as they relate to the actual county of Lafayette, does provide the reader with a sense of place in the novels, and of the variety of the fictional county, and, somewhat less satisfactorily, of Faulkner's artistry in selection. The reader is helped to identify similarities and to distinguish differences between the actual and the imagined by maps of Yoknapatawpha and Lafayette, the one superimposed upon the other. But a difficulty for anyone who may not have visited Faulkner country is that Miss Kerr sometimes refers to places that are not on her map, and though her directions are generally written clearly, surely the reader's time would have been saved and clarity served by their inclusion on the map. For that matter, since the chapter also compares the real Oxford to the invented Jefferson, one wonders why she did not include a map or maps of these. Oddly enough, she mentions the existing map of Oxford on page 43. Or, since Miss Kerr offers a small but admirable selection of photographs, she might have settled for the aerial photograph which is both available and helpful. What makes her selection of photographs a true bonus, inci- dentally, is that almost every one stimulates reverberations from the fic- tion and, unlike Martin Dain's Faulknerts County, does not distract the reader by directing him to particular and often unfortunately inapplicable passages. Although Miss Kerr always accomplishes well, and sometimes excel- lently, her objective of a "comprehensive view of Yoknapatawpha Coun- ty," her second intention of showing the relationship between the real county and the fictional is less well realized. Initially, she tells us that her "emphasis" is "on the fiction," that therefore "factual parallels to the fiction have generally been limited to footnotes." Presumably her major stress is, then, precisely the reverse of Ward Miner's The World of Wil- liam Faulkner, which is the closest thing to Miss Kerr's book; for Mr. Miner sought to discover "what happens to the material that an artist works with in creating a work of art." But Miss Kerr's difficulty is that, perhaps almost inevitably, her ancillary purpose begins to assume in- creasingly greater importance as she speaks repeatedly of Faulkner's creative powers of selection and emphasis, so that we begin to expect 781</page><page sequence="76">WILLIAM FAULKNER a more complete analysis of the artistss transmutation of his materials, but end in the last chapter with more on the mysteries of the uncon- scious than on the creative transformation. Perhaps it is an inescapable disappointment. It is more likely, however, that the book on Faulkner's use of his materials remains to be written. Coming later in time, Miss Kerr has, obviously, the advantage over Mr. Miner of having read the later novels and the intervening scholar- ship. As is to be expected, she lupdates the earlier book. It is perhaps also for these reasons that her book is so little dominated by a single theory of interpretation, as I am inclined to think Mr. Miner's is by the South-in-decay explanation, which to a large extent rules earlier Faulk- . . . ner criticism. That Miss Kerr does not subscribe to any overriding interpretive theory of Faulkner's cycle should, then, probably be regarded not as a disad- vantage but as an advantage, and, in any event, such a theory is not an inevitable outcome of the task she sets herself. Not that Miss Kerr fails to interpret, for her investigation does lead her to a good many particular, as against wide-ranging, critical insights. Her placing of Narcissa Benbow and Temple Drake in the context of Southern gyneolatry, for example, illuminates Faulkner's purpose in the stories in which each appears; not only the motivation of the Sutpen-Wash alliance of Absalom, Absalom! but its tragic consequence is clarified by her knowledge of poor-white and planter class relations. She makes clear the severe limitations, for Faulkner, of Gavin Stevens as a Southern liberal and gives depth to our perception of the Calvinistic self-assurance of characters in Light in August. On a larger scale, she gives additional meaning to Faulkner's repeated references to rapacity by her analysis of the exploitive conditions of the economy and to Faulkner's concept of the Negro through her discussion of social etiquette and violence. One wishes she had had time to develop both themes more fully. Occasionally, however, one is compelled to question position or fact. Despite its kernel of truth, for example, her statement that "Quentin Compson's suicide was motivated by Southern gyneolatry and incestuous impulses" hurriedly oversimplifies. She appears to strain-and, more seri- ous, perhaps to misrepresent Faulkner's view when she argues that Boon Hogganbeck's appearance in two different generations illustrates Faulk- ner's concept of Time. Especially in the light of Faulkner's stated willing- ness to accept his own inconsistencies from novel to novel and his tend- ency, as he said repeatedly (using most often a carpentry metaphor), to employ whatever would do the job, it seems much more likely that Faulkner simply found in Boon a character suited to his need of the moment and used him without worrying about a theory of Time. At one point Miss Kerr inaccurately applies the description of the town constable in The Reivers to Butch, the corrupt deputy. And Miss Kerr seems to forget that Joanna Burden and Joe in Light in August do not both stand as they talk before the murder. Occasionally the book is wordy or repetitious. It is not necessary, for example, for Miss Kerr to tell us quite so often that the background reality must be grasped so that we may understand the novels more completely. Moreover, the opening and closing chapters do not seem to 782</page><page sequence="77">do enough work. The first, "The Creation of the World of Yoknapataw- pha," despite a very interesting comparison of Faulkner with Balzac and Dickens, does little to advance one's knowledge unless one has not read much Faulkner; we begin to wish Miss Kerr would get on with her sub- ject. The last chapter, which discusses the nature of Faulkner's genius, is so general as to sound occasionally even banal. But weighed against the contributions, these are very minor matters. As Miss Kerr concludes, her book is "a necessary first step." She has, in the compass of one volume, covered excellently a great many subjects. To be sure, books which will deal in greater and more precise detail with individual aspects of the background for Faulkner's novels remain to be written; but, if so, Miss Kerr has defined even in her chapter titles and subtitles some of the areas which these studies will examine. Hers is not only a substantial achievement in its own right, but a pioneering study that should stimulate other investigations. Richardson, H. Edward. WILLIAM FAULKNER: THE JOURNEY TO SELF-DIS- COVERY. University of Missouri Press, 1969. 258 pp. $8.50. Reviewed by ELMO HOWELL, Memphis State University In this book H. Edward Richardson makes a close study of the early work of Faulkner, from the first published poetry and critical reviews through Sartoris. Until Faulkner found himself in Sartoris, he was, says Richardson, wandering between two worlds, the Old South and the New, without being able to find direction from either: "His mooring cables of identity had been cut, and he was adrift somewhere between the ports of the unattainable past and the unacceptable present." In Sartoris, the two were brought together for the first time with artistic purpose, and Faulk- ner's life and art took new direction and assumed a new authority. In the poetry, Richardson finds a strong awareness of a traditional past and a struggle to identify with it. The poem "Cathay," for example, pub- lished in 1919 at the University of Mississippi, is an allegorical rendering of Southern history. Only sharp sands and "blind desert horesmen" re- main where once stood the glories of Cathay. Where once thy splendors rose And cast their banners bright against the sky; Now go the empty years infinitely Rich with thy ghosts. In "The Hill," a prose sketch published in 1922, are the first "lineaments" of Jefferson and the Yoknapatawpha country. The work of this period suggests strong influences from England and the continent the French Symbolists, for example that Mr. Richardson treats at length; but the driving force behind the young Faulkner, the demon he was later to call it, was concern about the South. His life was as dissociated as his art during these early years. He wandered from New York to New Orleans to Paris, never pursuing any interest for any length of time; and during intervals at home in Oxford 783</page><page sequence="78">WILLIAM FAULKNER he assumed an outre manner that sometimes made him the derision of his neighbors. This behavior, says Richardson, was "an externalization of a familiar subconscious conflict." His effort to identify with the past and at the same time with the modern South, still prone and impotent in defeat, served as "a kind of catalytic agent" which eventually produced Sartoris and the important work that followed. Richardson's careful study of the early work, much of which has been neglected, contributes towards an understanding of Faulkner the mature artist, as well as of Southern literature in general. For in varying degrees, all Southern writers from the Civil War to the present have felt the same malaise in trying to bring together the old and the new in their region. To Faulkner, in particular, the tragic history of the South was almost a personal anguish, and the intensity of his vision can only be compre- hended in terms of his commitment. The effect of Mr. Richardson's book is to show that he did not stumble into greatness with Sartoris and The Sound and the Fury, but that for a decade at least he had moved under a tension that found release only when he returned to North Mississippi and settled down to write the Yoknapatawpha fiction. The author alternates long passages of explication with a lively account of Faulkner's early years, much of it freshly drawn from first-hand experi- ence in and around Oxford. He has a feeling for the Faulkner country and has obviously had wide contact with people who were close to Faulkner. His book will be useful to anyone trying to piece together the novelist's early life. A Watson, James Gray. THE SNOPES DILEMhfA: FAULKNER'S TRILOGY. Uni- versity of Miami Press, 1970. 242 pp. $7.95. If one sees the Snopes trilogy as a single novel in three parts, a strong case can be made for it as Faulkner's most representative work. From the first appearance of a Snopes in Faulkner's fiction in the mid-1920s to the completion of the chronicle with The Mansion in 1959, Faulkner was concerned with what he called "the Snopes dilemma," and it is possible to see the three volumes of the trilogy published between 1940 and 1959 as Faulkner's attempt to summarize and resolve the dominant themes and issues of the fiction written during his "major period" of the preceding two decades. Certainly it is with the Snopes trilogy that Faulkner best demonstrates the affirmative social philosophy expressed in the Nobel Prize address of 195the assertion not only that man will prevail but that it is "the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about." Faulkner said elsewhere that the Snopeses were "an invention of mine to tell a story of man in his struggle." According to Professor Watson in this enlightening study of the trilogy, that struggle is presented largely in terms of how other characters respond to the central figure of the series, Flem Snopes. He remains an unchanging archetype of amorality throughout the years covered by the chronicle, and all the other characters, minor as well as major, can be measured by the choices they are forced to make between what he represents and the eternal "verities" opposed to him. 784</page><page sequence="79">Watson develops this thesis in detail, taking up in sequence the indi- viduals and groups who populate the world of the trilogy and offering a close interpretive reading of their actions in relation to the challenge posed by the dilemma. If at times his readings seem almost paraphrases of what the intelligent reader would likely see for himself, Watson's approach has the merit of offering an abundance of carefully considered evidence to support a clearly stated thesis. His study of the trilogy should go a long way towards moving that work to the forefront of the Faulkner canon. B Inge, M. Thomas, ed. WILLIAM FAULKNER: A ROSE FOR EMILY.

Knopf, 1969. 300 pp. $6.95. Reviewed by ROBERT MURRAY DAVIS, University of Oklahoma Forty years ago Ifan Kyrle Fletcher made the first and until now the only serious attempt to discover some facts about the man behind the half 787</page><page sequence="82">RONALD FIRBANK scandalous, half legendary facade of Ronald Firbank, drawing for the most part upon the testimony of Firbank's rather narrow circle of ac- quaintances. Fletcher had no access to and obviously little knowledge of the large body of unpublished material letters to and from Firbank, manuscripts, typescripts, notebooks, marginalia, albums, publishers' rec- ords which reveal a great deal more, if by no means all, of the man who built the mask as consciously as he constructed his novels. In preparing her Bibliography of Ronald Firbank (Soho Bibliographies, 1963), Miriam J. Benkovitz discovered this materialt and now she has supplemented it with other records and interviews to present an all but definitive portrait of Firbank the man and artist who wrote Vainglory, Valmouth, and five more novels strikingly original in subject and technique and to place him in the context of his period. As usual/ the reality is far more interesting than the legend. The first half of the book, which emphasizes Firbank's family and social milieu, is like an upper middle class version of a Lawrence novel. The family fortune stemmed from the efforts of Joseph, Ronald's grand- father, who pulled himself from the mining pits to become a leading railway contractor. His son Thomas seems to have been negligible first under the direction of a powerful father, then under that of a wife who was several inches taller and generations superior in social connections. She furnished the motive power which put him into politics, where he earned a seat in Parliament and later a knighthood at Edward Vl l's coronation; she encouraged his purchases of a rich variety of objets d'art, which were in daily use by the growing family; she provided the center of a country home which was, she thought, like a paradise. In short, Miss Benkovitz demonstrates, the surface of family life "takes on the conventional and sugary quality of popular Victorian fiction." The reality, which is conveyed as effectively as the illusion, must have been quite another thing, judging from the results. None of the four chil- dren finished school and most of them never finished anything. Joey/ the eldest, died at twenty after a brief but hectic career of drink and un- specified dissipation. Bertie, the third child and Ronald's closest friend within the family, did manage to marry and to emigrate or be sent to Canada- but he returned to England and died suddenly at twenty-five. Heather, the "Baby," outlived them all, unmarried, reclusive, eccentric, and for a time the lover of her chauffer. Sir Thomas suffered financial reverses and died at sixty. Lady Firbank, increasingly imperious and demanding of her children's allegiance, hung on to the age of seventy-three before cancer claimed her, leaving desolate and almost incapacitated her surviving son, Ronald. As a child, Ronald was quiet, obedient, rather frail, and very much his mother's boy. No one else could remember him very well- his tutors misdated his stay with them or wrote standardized commendations; he was not even ragged at Cambridge, Miss Benkovitz says; he was always surprised and gratified that anyone should recognize him. He began to seek attention, of course: in writing and illustrating stories and poems, at first for his mother; in striking up correspondence with the great or at least notorious like Sir Alfred Douglas and the actor Gdouard de Max; andt most strikingly, in cultivating the artificial personality of the dandy 788</page><page sequence="83">and decadent. This is the Ronald Firbank of the legend, the Cafe Royal character, like Jay Gatsby, "leaking sawdust at every pore," who "saun- tered through London's streets, skirting Covent Garden to avoid the 'massacre of flowers' and holding a handkerchief before his eyes when he passed a butcher's shop," who frequented the Eiffel Tower restaurant, the ballet, and the theater and sat on the fringes of a crowd of artists, writers, and beauties of both sexes, and who, in the charmingly unrelia- ble testimony of Sir Osbert Sitwell, referred to the first world war as "that awful persecution" by which he meant a persecution of Ronald Firbank. What saved him or at least allowed him to survive was his talent and his dedication to his art. Miss Benkovitz emphasizes here, as she did in her Bibliography, the care and energy which he devoted to his novels from their inception to the smallest details of their production. At first, he seemed to desire recognition as the end of his writing; later, and increasingly, he found in the exercise of his craft an escape from and a compensation for the horrors of "reality" a term which he emphatically rejected. His life, of course, had been marked by his mother, just as his art was conditioned by her milieu. In minor stories in his sentimental vein like Odette, Santal, and the unpublished "Legend of Saint Gabrielle," he mingles love and death; the search for a substitute parent ends in a vision of corruption or dissolution. In life, he became more and more flagrantly homosexual, and Miss Benkovitz maintains that he desired disapproval of his proclivities and eventually came to dislike them. But in his novels, as she takes care to show, he was able to detach himself from his mother's influence and to make comedy from the atmosphere she had created and even from his own aberrations. It may seem paradoxical that the second half of the book, devoted to Ronald Firbank as artist, is less coherent and aesthetically pleasing than the presentation of Firbank the adolescent exotic, but the paradox dis- appears when one sees the texture of Firbank's life. Until the outbreak of war, he moved through a coherent society, seeking new acquaintances and new experiences. Thereafter, he became something of a peripatetic recluse, distrustful of almost everyone, absorbed in his novels, occasionally revealing surprisingly ordinary interests in riding, swimming, and the society of best-selling authors like Blasco Ibanez, author of The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. During this period, 1915-1926, no one milieu or consistent observer helps to define him. He even died in solitude and, though a Catholic of sorts, was mistakenly buried in the Protestant cemetery in Rome. Miss Benkovitz has chosen wisely, I think- not to try to find the man in the works but to rely upon objective evidence, and at times there is little evidence. The dust jacket insists that the book is not a "critical biography," but this is unduly modest and perhaps misleading, for in the second part the novels occupy the place of the Edwardian milieu in the first as a major supporting interest to the events of Firbank's life. To be sure, Miss Benkovitz makes no systematic analysis of each novel, but she does presentvarious theories about the shape of Firbank's career and about the sources and effects of his most characteristic and original techniques. She draws heavily from James Hafley's 1956 critical essay, which argues 789</page><page sequence="84">RONALD FIRBANK that Firbank used Christianity as a moral norm for his satire, and she strongly implies that Firbank grew progressively more skillful as a novelist. These generalizations are open to question, the first on the grounds that Firbank simultaneously desired and satirized both license and limitation, the second on the grounds that Prancing Nigger, his penultimate novel, is perhaps the worst he ever wrote and Valmouth, which came in mid- career is superior to everything except, perhaps, Concerning the Eccen- tricities of Cardinal Pire//i. Apart from these reservations, one can only commend her perceptions that Firbank's major technical achievement was "expertness in merging comment and scene through form," which modifies the theory that he was essentially a "dialogue novelist"; that his chief effects depend upon the fusing of the satiric and the ridiculous and the ability to mingle pathos and irony; and that he carefully struc- tured his novels according to principles which he discovered and devel- oped for himself. All of these insights are brought to bear in Miss Benkovitz's analysis of Firbank's last novel, Cardinal Pirelli. Noted critics and novelists Evelyn Waugh, Edmund Wilson, Cyril Connolly, E. M. Forster among them have testified generally that Firbank created deli- cate, intricate, and enduring works of art. In the commentary on Pirelli, Miss Benkovitz demonstrates the truth of their generalizations. Those who seek to understand Firbank's art will find her analysis the most absorbing part of her book and perhaps the most useful single commentary on Firbank. What Miss Benkovitz has done, she has done extremely well. Yet, careful, sensible, and at times brilliant though the book is, it comes just short of being definitive. Her analysis of the novels remains to be ex- tended and perhaps modified; Firbank's notebooks must be examined more thoroughly to reveal the gradual and sometimes almost imper- ceptible shaping of plots and characters; and the crucial letters from Firbank to his mother, which she examined but from which she could not quote, might throw sidelights upon his life which even the best paraphrase cannot do. Despite these omissions and they are relatively minor one must be grateful that a scholar of Miss Benkovitzts patience, accuracy, and sensitivity has been granted access to materials from which she has constructed a new and more accurate portrait of Firbank the artist and complex human being to replace the caricature extant in the minds of most who have heard of him at all.

KANTRA, Villanova University Writing monographs on individual authors may not be the easiest chore, nor the most remunerative, but there is an awful lot of it going on; perhaps it is more a physiological necessity than an intellectual enterprise. The kLA and MHRA bibliographies in their international bulk suggest that even the hoppers of academe are clogged with biographies, para- phrases of individual works, and, still, after a half century, new criticism. The presumptive "wider audience" for such monographs readers of 790</page><page sequence="85">Sunday supplements and weekly journals of opinion are often fore- warned about the aftermath of a Publication Explosion we already live with; Kenneth Burke somewhere conjures up the image, for sanctions justifying injustices, of bat dung accumulating in caves. Numerous scholars and publishers exhausting themselves in repetitious exertion may be healthy, but it's not a pretty picture, or sound, and one listens for more overtures to silence, perhaps especially in the learned journals. One feels implicated in choosing between Augustinian metaphors which are alimentary or procreative, and propitious enough to describe it all; born between . . . Two years ago Sylvia Bowman wrote a good-natured reply to criticism of her three successive brain children, the American, English, and World Series-TUSAS, TEAS, and TWAS, to people who know them well-and of the fifteen-hundred (!) scholars whose services she has attending to them. Presumably there will be matching sets of uniform volumes on the shelves of libraries aJI over the world, and she is happy for that. She answers for all of themt past, present, and future, with a maternal im- perviousness to criticism of their youth, simplicity, "unevenness," and so on. Recent TEAS volumes on Ronald Firbank and Rose Macaulay (see my separate review below) are representative, not of the massive- ness of the series, for after all each volume in it is slim, but rather of its modest intentions, and even then only occasional achievement. The Ronald Firbank is self-consciously larded with "at fi rst't glances ("I say 'at first glance' because we may, if we look beneath the surface of things . . .") all the while insisting that claims for complexity and density in Firbank's work would be "silly," that Firbank can be regarded erroneously as a satirist only by readers who take him seriously, that, "of course, to read Firbank with such seriousness is to destroy the marve- lous effect." The book begs off providing a thorough biography "for a number of reasons," while allowing that Firbank's short family history has "the greatest possible interest to both the student of literature and the psychologist." It disavows a "serious" purpose, and aims at the large target of "wide audience," which is all right. But, in its trappings, if not its substance, it aspires to be scholarship, and here it fails badly: arbitrary and whimsical documentation, sentences replete with handsome but unfunctional subordinate clauses, emphatic but circular thoughts, paragraphs with balmy individual focus, chapters strung together in a chronology devoid of expository continuity, and lengthy quo- tations (an entire chapter from Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli) mostly unexplicated, simply intending to "show" Firbank's "technical proficiency." Elementary literary theory is not itself objectionable; but what does it mean to say that "true satire" is not what Firbank writes, that, rather, he simply "uses a satiric method," that "he is occasionally satirical," that "it is not correct to classify him, in the purest sense, as a satirist"? The mind boggles. Perhaps Firbank did modify and reshape the fin de siecle or Decadent tradition, as this book redundantly puts the case; but it's scarcely alluded to, much less proven. A poor, suffering sophomore, trying hard to write a Research Paper, will not have here a model worth emulating, and will conclude that Firbank's literary efforts are unfathomable. 791</page><page sequence="86">B Potoker, Edward Martin.

Reviewed by BARRY GROSS, Michigan State University Like Jay Gatsby, Milton Stern wants too much. The Golden Moment, he admits, is a "personal book." But he also wants it to be the book, that Fitzgerald book which will tell the reader "what Fitzgerald is about." Well, this reader now knows what Milton Stern's Fitzgerald is about- it is a personal book and it has been enjoyable finding out, but as for Fitzgerald, the Fitzgerald . . . Stern places the reviewer in a difficult position. His book, he claims, is not intended "for Fitzgerald experts, . . . but for interested readers who, knowing the Fitzgerald facts, would want a unified view of the meaning of those facts." Like most persistent students of Fitzgerald, I think I know what Fitzgerald, at least my Fitzgerald, is about. I have a fairly unified view of my own. For the purposes of this review, then, I will pretend that this book is, indeed, intended for me. Even if it isn't, I have learned a good deal from it. Stern is interested in Fitzgerald's life and fiction as they illuminate "the 'identity crisis' of our American time." He is interested in Fitz- gerald's "uses of histor-y, the American identity, the moral reconstruction of the American past." In his introduction Stern comments that he con- sidered calling his book The Americanness of Scott Fitzgerald, a less attractive but far more accurate title than The Golden Moment. The Americanness of . . . pretty much sums it up. It is, I think, a useful, even a corrective approach to Fitzgerald. For quite a long time Fitzgerald's fiction was imprisoned in the no doubt fascinating but highly restrictive details of his life and his time, making it difficult to see Fitzgerald in an American context. Mr. Stern gives full measure to both Fitzgerald's life and time but he also persistently pushes 792</page><page sequence="87">them and the novels-outward. His intent is to explicate intensively and extensively the notions Wright Morris suggests in The Territory Ahead (I fully share Stern's admiration for Morris' book). Stern does not completely escape the traps I take to be inherent in such an intention. The Fitzgerald is as much endangered by the expansive approach as he is by the more parochial ones. if he can be locked up in his life and his time, he can also get lost in the vast panorama of @'Americanness," strangled in the twisting strands that criss-cross Ameri- can social and literary history. Nor does he fully escape the methodoZogical abuses this intention inevitably must employ. Although Stern early states that "there is really little point in making lists of sources and analogues, balancing columns of life against columns of art" he does frequently balance columns of Fitzgerald against columns of other writers. Once in a while Mr. Stern's analogies are gratuitous: "like the people on the pavement in Robinson's 'Richard Cory,' Amory thought that Humbird was everything to make him wish that he were in his place." But usually they are provocative: Fitzgerald, Stern says, "pointed out, like James and Hawthorne before him, that in Americat the ease, though not the readiness, of vertical' social intercourse is prevented by a loss of the presentness of the past" or "like Twain and Dreiser" Fitzgerald "knew the attractions of the world of money and the nausea in the realization of its actualities't or "with a few callow pretensions and a few changes in background, Tom Sawyer becomes Amory Blaine, just as, with a few talents, Clyde Griffiths becomes Jay Gatsby." If an analogy is worth making, it should be, indeed demands to be, pursued. I respond immediately to such statements with a "hmm" or a "huh?" or a "what?"- in short! I am interested. If Mr. Stern instead of his book were in front of me I would say, "Wait a minute, let's think about this." Is Fitzgerald's vision really like James's and Hawthorne's? Is lames's really like Hawthorne's? Does Fitzgerald know about money as Twain and Dreiser do? Does Twain know about money as Dreiser does? How does Tom Sawyer metamorphose into Amory Blaine? And if he does, does he do so "just as" Clyde Griffiths metamorphoses into Jay Gatsby? And does Clyde Griffiths metamorphose into Jay Gatsby? Interesting notions, at least for the sake of argument, and probably worth pursuing. But Stern doesn't pause and doesn't allow me to, short of closing the book. Like my opening simile, his use of analogy is largely rhetorical. He asserts these relationships rather than demonstrating or documenting them because I don't think he is all that interested in them. He uses them to establish a context, that backdrop of American social and literary history against which Stern's Fitzgerald is to be discovered and under- stood. He uses them to set the scene, the American scene. So The Golden Moment is not so nearly reductivist as I may have made it seem. The meat of the book-fully two-thirds of it-is an exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, explication of The Great Garsby and Tender Is the Night (the chapter on Gatsby runs 127 pages, just six short of the 133 pages the complete novel occupies in The Fitzgerald Reader). And these discussions are rewarding. Even when I feel that Stern 793</page><page sequence="88">F. SCOTT FITZGERALD overelaborates, even when I am more skeptical than convinced, I am kept interested. I am made to wonder and react and speculate on the thoughts that Stern sets a-buzzing in my head. What more could one ask from a critical study of an author about whom much has already been written? There are also some dangers in the book's "personalness." For in- stance, Stern's observations are occasionally highly idiosyncratic. In one footnote Stern discovers parallels between This Side of Paradise and Lolita. It is, I think, Stern's perception alone that provides the link and he takes obvious delight in pursuing it. But he stops himself before very long because "there's little profit, if any, in this kind of aside. It becomes too preciously involved and ingenious." Little profit, perhaps, but a great deal of fun. Yet it is good that he is disciplined enough to perceive the tendency inherent in his method toward the preciously involved and ingenious, the idiosyncratic and arbitrary, and is in sufficient control of his methodology to know when it threatens to control him. The book is also personal in its obsessiveness. Although Stern ascribes to Fitzgerald a "compulsive insistence with which he makes [his] story symbolically and inevitably American," I am more inclined to believe it is Stern who is so compulsively insistent. It is to Stern's imagination that "the very nature of America as a metaphor constantly suggests . . . the belief that the history of the hero is an enactment of the history of America." I have no difficulty in allowing Stern his insistences and per- sistences, especially when he pursues them with such vigor. My difficulty arises in trying to separate Milton Stern from Scott Fitzgerald. In the course of The Golden Moment they tend to blend. Which suggests another way in which The Golden lWoment is a personal book. About a particular point in This Side of Paradise Stern admits that he is "not certain that Fitzgerald was fully conscious of his intention" and that he "cannot document [his] conclusion." But, he goes on to say, "the combination of tone, intention, biography" the "general sense of what Fitzgerald was like" "makes [him] certain of what Fitzgerald was doing, if not certain of Fitzgerald's consciousness of it." This is pretty much Stern's stance throughout the book. He relies on his own ability to intuit and perceive and understand, to know Fitzgerald better than he knew himself, and not even through the by now standard practices of psychoanalysis. Mr. Stern is sure he knows what Fitzgerald was like and, for his purposes, that is sufficient justification. And so it is. I am not embarrassed to call The Golden Moment an immodest book because I do not mean it pejoratively and because Stern is not embarrassed by it. Anyway, I too admit to immodesty- what is more immodest than reviewing?-and reserve the right to be immodest in a similar vein: though I cannot document my conclusion, the tone of Stern's book makes mc- all right, I'll hedge-fair/y certain of what he is doing. In brief, I think Stern's book is an illustration of his theses, that his medium is his message. I mean that the compulsive insist- ence with which Stern makes the Scott Fitzgerald story and stories sym- bolically and inevitably American is a vivid example of the American character he is concerned with examining. I began this review facilely, by comparing Milton Stern to Jay Gatsby facilely, but, I hope, not gratuitously. For as-if not quite just as Jay Gatsby serves Stern as 794</page><page sequence="89">prototypically American, Stern serves me. Only a peculiarly, if not ex- clusively, American imagination would perceive "the history of the hero" as "an enactment of the history" of a nation. And so is the ac- companying conviction that one man, relying on his own intuition and drawing upon his own experience, can analyze and document this re- markable phenomenon. What is more American than the insistent and persistent efforts of Americans to define what is American? I am not so sure as Stern is that "Fitzgerald was not interested in taking off a character as much as he was in defining a type," @'a national type which fascinated and repelled him, in which he felt his identity as an American, and in which he saw the history of America as it was written meaningfully for him," but it is clear to me Stern is. He is less in- terested in "taking off" Fitzgerald than in defining that repulsive and fascinating type in which Stern sees the history of America written mean- ingfully for him. And, I might add, meaningfully for me, thanks to Stern's infectious enthusiasms. And yet . . . and yet . . . as I read Stern's book I kept thinking of the opening of "The Rich Boy." "Begin with an individual," Fitzgerald says- I agree with Stern that Fitzgerald is the narrator-'/and before you know it you find that you have created a type; begin with a type, and you find that you have created nothing." In a sense, Stern proves Fitzgerald wrong. In his book ---I am not going to try to guess what processes Stern went through before and during the composition of it. Stern does begin with a type and certainly does manage to create some- thing- the type, quintessential. In the next paragraph Fitzgerald says, "there are no types, no plurals. There is a rich boy, and this is his story and not his brother's story." Yet Fitzgerald called his story @The Rich Boy," not "A Rich Boy," and he does go on to tell us "about the very rich" (my italics). Fitzgerald is skeptical of his own creation and so am 1. I only wish Stern were a little more skeptical of his, only wish he had entertained the possibility that perhaps, just perhaps, there are no types. But then The Golden Moment would not be the quintessential American book I think it is and value it for being. B Piper, Henry Dan, ed.

Twayne's English Authors Series, No. 89. New York, 1969. 174 pp. $4.50. Reviewed by NORMAN KELVIN, The City College of City University of New York While he lived, E. M. Forster enjoyed an unusual reputation. Born in 1879, he said of himself that he belonged to the end of the Victorian era. Many critics implicitly agreed: they saw in him a writer who had kept alive the best aspects of Romanticism and nineteenth-century humanism. Yet Forster was also among the first "new" twentieth-century novelists. Most distinctive is that he published his last novel in 1924 but for more than forty subsequent years abided, like one of his own "guardians" in Kr W. Gransden's word within our literary consciousness. In 1958,, V. S. Pritchett observed that '8Forster has survived by interposing." It can be said that he interposed between the vital aspects of the modernist tradi- tion and the attacks upon it, from within and without. Because Forster died in 1970 (at the age of 91), Frederick P. W. Mc- Dowell's book is one of the concluding interpretations written while Forster was alive. There is appropriateness in the position granted by events to the book. The author of numerous articles about Forster, Frederick McDowell has brought together, under a clear and forceful view of his own, a thorough knowledge of Forster's own work and of the voluminous secondary literature. One result of McDowell's confident mastery of his subject is that he freely judges critical statements made by other writers and acknowledges debts when he believes that he has incurred them. In E. M. Forster, there is a refreshing and significant use of miscellane- ous, uncollected prose. Reference to one fugitive article prompts Mc- Dowell to assert that Forster was 'aware of the claims of private life" but that these did not "negate, in Forster's view, the intellectual's public responsibilities." There is other evidence that during the last forty years of his life-particularly during World War II and the immediate Post-War period Forster confronted public events with unequivocal commitment. But McDowell, by citing Forster's occasional essays, has amplified the record and given it definition. McDowell's discussion of Forster's novels is distinguished. As Forster was a master of "recurring motifs" and "image clusters,t' McDowell is a 797</page><page sequence="92">E. M. FORSTER critic who perceives new associations. Discussing, for example, the con clusion to Howards End, he says that the son of Helen Schlegel and Leonard Bast "is, in effect, a Blakean child, innocent perhaps but apoca- lyptic in his innocence, a divine child. He serves the same purpose as Gino's baby, who is killed, in Where Angels Fear to Tread; as the boy Stephen . . . in The Longest Journey; as Stephen's child in that novel; and as the unborn child of Fielding and Stella in A Passage to India." One of McDowell's central insights is that in Forster's writing reality embraces limits, balance, distinctions, unions, and opposites. Forster's humanism, for example, was "no blind faith in human possibilities, no unconsidered belief in the nobility of man's nature and the rightness of his impulses. Balancing Forster's Romantic enthusiasms, there is his consciousness of man's limitations." A miscellaneous essay enables Mc- Dowell to note: "Forster concludes that earthly life is not a failure but a tragedy, principally because it is difficult to translate private decencies into public ones." Characterizing Rickie, of The Longest Journey, Mc- Dowell says: "To his detriment, Rickie tends to distrust the concrete as opposed to the idealizing of it." As for A Passage to India, "In its ap- proach to the transcendent," it"reaches romance and prophecy; but it does so without sacrifice of social verisimilitude." Indeed, McDowell's discussion of A Passage to India, "Forster's best novel," is splendid because, among other reasons, McDowell's perception of opposites contained within entities matches the challenge. Agreeing with Louise Daumer and Wilfred Stone, McDowell writes that the Marabar Caves "comprise the sum total of all experiencc the locus of community activity and of burial rites, the womb and tomb of all existence, an arche- type of the great mother and of annihilation." MclDowell's view of how differences function together informs his view of the novel in general: "The motion" of A Passage to India "is cyclic rather than linear; dialecti- cal opposites are not resolved and continue indefinitely to exert their strength. Forster is at once preoccupied with a timeless unity and witl the concrete manifestation of that unity in time." When McDowell discusses Forster as a literary critic, the theme of opposites within unity continues, although here, questions are inadvertent- ly raised. "Forster, who espouses a paradoxical view of art, views it as self-contained even while its influence radiates beyond its demarcated universe. Art is at once esthetic and ethical in nature and authority, at once individual and social in origin and significance." This description of Forster's view of art would create fewer problems if it were meant primarily as an estimate of Forster's own art, and only secondarily as a comment upon his esthetic ideas. Given the span of years during which Forster considered other writers, inconsistency as well as paradox is to be expected. As for theoretical problems, Forster sometimes raised them but left them unresolved, although it should be added that he never claimed to be a formal esthetician. Of a different order of interest is the rich texture produced by Mc- Dowell's association of Forster with other writers. Particularly interesting is the link suggested between Forster and D. H. Lawrence. McDowell writes: "In discussing Lawrence as a prophetic writer . . . Forster reveals his own affinities with him." We are, however, reminded that Forster 798</page><page sequence="93">judged Lawrence's "greatness to be esthetic rather than intellectual" and wrote that Lawrence "irradiates from within, so that every colour has a glow and every form a distinctness which could not otherwise be ob- tained." To me, McDowell's use of Forster's words seems employed- convincingly in an oblique rebuttal of the charge, sometimes made, that Forsterts prose lacks the passion of Eawrence's. If such a rebuttal were intended, I would have liked to see it developed; suggesting, perhaps, that the passion in the prose of two writers may differ but be equal in intensity. With less conjecture about McDowell's intentions, I wish that more; space had been allotted to Forster's short stories. McDowell's guiding theme-"Forster's Natural Supernaturalism" is appropriate. But a seven- page treatment of ten of the tales constitutes the discussion. It not only prohibits development of McDowell's best insights but tends to sweep aside details that do not support the author's overview of the stories. Nevertheless, McDowell's E. M. Forster is fresh and stimulating. At one point McDowell says: "In his novels and miscellaneous books alike, Forster's aim is to shape refractory experience to the requirements of order and pattern, but not at the expense of its vitality or of the intensity of his vision." As literary criticism, McDowell's book has order, vitality, . . . anu vision. B Rutherford, Andrew, ed. TWENTIETH CENTURY INTERPRETATIONS OF A PASSAGE TO INDIA: A COLLECTION OF CRITICAL ESSAYS.

Cornell University Press, 1969. 234 pp. $9.50. Reviewed by ELMER SUDERMAN, Gustavus Adolphus College Once so well known, but then quickly forgotten, Harold Frederic is com- ing to be remembered again, and The Novels of Harold Frederic by Austin Briggs, Jr. will do much to keep his memory alive and enhance a reputation that is quickly growing. Objecting to those critics who would make Frederic only an angry young man or who would merely attempt to establish his place in the realistic movement, Briggs contends that they oversimplify Frederic's contributions to American fiction, and he argues that Frederic was essentially a comic writer who did not share the bumptious hopes of his characters (or his age, for that matter), who were enthusiastic about the possibility of their own development and of changing the world in which they lived. Briggs is certainly correct in pointing out that Frederic's technique is "to put presumably predictable types in presumably predictable situations and then, in flashes of ironic illumination, reveal that the results were not predictable after all, and to treat conventional materials in a highly-unconventional fashion." Briggs em- phasizes Frederic's ability to impose in a wry and good-natured tone "the comic contrast between the grand roles that people plan for themselves and the roles they actually play." Briggs successfully defends his thesis. More important, he does not miss the significant point that Frederic's comic insights are also incisive criti- cisms, especially of the sanguine view of human nature prevalent in Frederic's America. Certain that man was not, as many of his contem- poraries thought, made in the image of God and unspoiled, Frederic put a damper on the buoyant confidence and brimming hopes of a self- assured time by depicting man as a rickety, shabby, poor creature, deluded by the illusion that he could single-handedly reform the world. Frederic's characters are uniformily disappointed in their progress; or, and this is more important, if they are not, the reader is. Briggs succeeds in showing how each of the novels exemplifies the thesis. Indeed, one of the most important virtues of this study is that it makes unmistakably clear that other novels besides The Damnation of Theron Ware particularly Seth's Brother's Wife, The Lawton Girl, Gloria Mundi and The Market Placc are remarkably original and worthy of study. Unlike many books which attempt to interpret the works of a novelist by one dominant pattern, Briggs does not have to force his pattern on Frederic's novels. He has chosen his thesis wisely (though he overemphasizes the comic element and does not see Frederic's anger clearly enough, for there is a great deal more invective than Briggs sees, especially in The Damnation of Theron Ware) and is able to make a cogent argument for it as one of the central themes in the novels. While Briggs' key is by no means the only one that will help us to understand Frederic, it is an important one and will set the tone for subsequent interpretations for years to come. Fortunately it is a balanced and sane reading and a fruitful one. It will not impede further investigations and 800</page><page sequence="95">interpretations and will open doors to further understanding of Fredericts novels. E Sage, Howard.

JOHN GAISWORTHY A Barker, Dudley. THE MAN OF PRINCIPLE: A BIOGRAPHY OF JOHN GALS- WORTHY. Stein and Day, 1969. 240 pp. $6.95 Reviewed by HELMUT E. GERBER, Northern Illinois University Dudley Barker's portrait of Galsworthy appears to fall between two stools. The portrait is not whitewashed with sentimentality or almost totally de- humanized by a droning neutrality of narration as in the main H. V. Marrot's Life and Letters is. It is also not burdened with the heavy weight of inconsequential details resulting from nit-picking scholarship. It is not the final word on Galsworthy, and it is not merely a superficial introduc- tion. Actually, Barker manages to settle his book comfortably in an easy chair between the two extremes. Barker's book is an interpretation of the man of divided mind who wrote not only the first volume of Forsyte Saga but also the distinctly dif- ferent last volume. Barker's title is, perhaps, too neat. It would have been more accurate to insist on the plural of "principle," a notion D. H. Lawrence may have had in mind when he referred to Galsworthy as "a sneaking old cynic" or what others have meant in calling him a hypocrite. Galsworthy was neither a cynic nor a hypocrite. He was, once he ceased being a conventional toff or dandy, the spoiled, indolent scion of a wealthy family, a man with potential or, as the reviewers' jargon has it, a man of promise. He remained a man of promise for many years, at last managing to subvert the promise and emerge more or less victorious as a humane man of property. He began as the conforming son of his father and mother, momentarily tottered on the brink of independence from the conventional "upper crust" norm and on the verge of individuality, perhaps even orig- inality, and returned safely to the conventional mold. He was finally the son his father and mother could take pride in, properly esteemed by his 802</page><page sequence="97">own class, unostentatiously wealthy, a gentleman-philanthropist. It is what came between the beginning and the end that makes Galsworthy inter- esting as a person and as a writer. Only that and no more. To have strug- gled genuinely with a double sense of guilt, social and personal, and established a personality as a writer interesting enough to warrant serious attention is a considerable accomplishment. It is the complex Galsworthy, the man of divided mind, in fact, the interesting Galsworthy, on whom Mr. Barker concentrates. The two crucial facts of Galworthy's life are his properly respectful but unloving relationship to his mother and his admiration of and compliance to the strong will of his successful father. The first is the basis of his rela- tionship with Ada and the sexual themes in his works; the second is the basis of his relationship to the critics in general and Edward Garnett in particular and the social themes in his works. It is silly to say, as some revie.wers have heavy-handedly said, "Freudians, please note." Mr. Barker has served well those who still read Galsworthy by reminding them of the pre-Ada and pre-Garnett relationships as, in part, determinants of the kind of man and writer Galsworthy became. How personal was the im- pulse that imparted considerable vigor to the works conceived close to or during the period of greatest tension in his life is evident in the words Barker pertinently quotes from a letter Galsworthy wrote to Edward Gar- nett: "The novels were 'simply the criticism of one half of myself by the other . . . not a piece of social criticism."' The mother he could not love and who seemed to have no needs he could gratify, ironically gave him, as he wrote, "a capacity and almost a liking for nursing." In one sense or another he spent most of his years with Ada nursing her, travelling to healthier climates with her, constantly serving. Here, indeed, was a woman who needed his attention, who wel- comed it, and, one rather suspects, subtly demanded it. The father who "ruled" his life and of whom he was "truly and deeply fond" also played a fundamental role in contributing to the personal tension that gives the early works a sense of felt experience. Galsworthy at Harrow and later at Oxford gave every sign of muddling through to an undistingiushed, con- ventional, complacent life. The only threat appeared to be young John's persistent interest in Sybil Carr, who was considered unsuitable. Old John managed very neatly to manipulate his son out of the young lady's life, but, in so doing, he also managed to sensitize young John to class and social conditions which contributed to a further division of mind. Enforced travel to Canada and elsewhere to keep him out of Miss Carr's sight ex- posed John to worlds quite different from his own and made him aware of "the limits to his smug world of well-to-do gentility." When rather flamboyant "outsiders" (Georg Sauter, the painter who married Lilian Galsworthy, and the brilliant Sanderson family) entered the well- ordered world he had been accustomed to, John was quickly drawn to them. His world vastly expanded. By the Sandersons Galsworthy was drawn more and more into the world of intellectuals and by the Sauters into the world of artists. He took up "an uneasily agnostic attitude," and he began to develop a "distaste . . . for the life he was leading and the kind of existence for which he seemed to be destined." The emotional emptiness arising out of his relationship 803 </page><page sequence="98">to his mother and the self-critical sensibility arising out of his exposure to the worlds of the Sauters and the Sandersons into which his father had un- knowingly driven him prepared Galsworthy for the next crucial influence: "the discovery of intense poverty . . ., alongside the small world of substantial wealth in which he himself moved." His father having sent him to collect rents, Galsworthy was "distressed . . . to discover the living conditions of some of the people from whom the family's wealth was partly derived." According to a friend with whom he shared a flat, Galsworthy "night after night . . . set off alone to wander through 'the poorer districts, listening to the conversations of the people, sometimes visiting doss-houses."' "I have had my glimpse of another world," Gals- worthy later wrote, "and tasted the liquors brewed in its dark corners." His sense of frustration, on the one hand, and guilt, on the other, resulting from the neutral mother-son relationship and his deepening sense of guilt over the privileges his class earned at the expense of another were yet to be capped by the most influential experience of all. Ada, the wife of his cousin Arthur Galsworthy came into his life during the same period while he was making his "night-time journeys" into "the world of dark and broken waters." Ada and John had met once in 1893, more often during 1894, and by 1895 "the love affair between Ada and young John was in full progress." After becoming lovers, they en- dured, as Marrot, on Ada's authority, reports, "the long turmoil of their hearts that life 'spun between ecstasy and torture' which was to last through nine mortal years." It is finally the discovery of the slums and the love affair with Ada that provided Galsworthy with the most deeply felt life-sources for his fiction and that resulted in his best work. Unfortunately, there was only so much material and when it had served its fictional purpose, no more events as intensely experienced were forthcoming. His father had died, Galsworthy had his legacy, he and Ada had been married and gained social acceptance, and he was a respected and successful author. Life was good and relatively placid. Little "ecstasy" and no "torture" remained to feed Galsworthy's imagination. He went on to write many more volumes, novels, plays, reminiscences, but only rarely was he able again to capture something of the sense of inner struggle, something of the "world of dark and broken waters" that give his earlier work, but especially The Man of Property, a life below the surface. Barker has written an interpretative biography, not a critical study of the man's imaginative production. In so doing, Barker has made the usual identifications of autobiographical scenes and real-life persons in the fiction. He has perhaps contributed some new source material in citing information gathered from Arthur Galsworthy's second wife Wilhelmine and from a housekeeper. He recognizes the dangers of filling in biographi- cal details with evidence drawn from fiction, but he does resort to this device. More important, Barker has written a readable book on his subject and he treats the subject with reasonable objectivity. Above all, he has sug- gested to a new generation of readers that a man who lived life discreetly and wrote about it discreetly is not necessarily a dull man, nor his fiction a mere veneer. He has provided a less muddied glimpse inside Galsworthy 804</page><page sequence="99">than we have had. The moral of the book, perhaps, is that it is hard to be a man of principle but ever harder, as for a time in Galsworthy's life, a man of principles. C Smith, Philip Edward, 11.

New York, 1969. 184 pp. $4.50. Reviewed by JOHN J. MOOD, Ball State University One is in a quandary. Here is a fairly good book written by a rather open-minded academician for other academicians about a very dangerous and subversive phenomenon: Allen Ginsberg. The problem is does one present the book in a way calculated to win the attention and interest of those academicians who will be reading this review, or does one grapple with the deeper questions posed by and resulting from Merrill's book, questions anathema to academia, questions from the side of Gins- berg? I do not know. But I do think of Goethe, who wrote more embarrass- ingly bad books than any great writer in history, and who could not have cared less. He was interested in the process, not the product, the growth, not the goal. Now Ginsberg is no Goethe. But he did drive Merrill to learn something about the fatal Western "compulsion to be right," to succeed for example, as a poet. His book, however, flies flatly in the face of that Zen wisdom, for it is finally about how successful a poet Ginsberg is. Wearily to try to dispose of that one again, remember that Ciardi said somewhere-referring to the line from Ginsberg's Howl, "the total animal soup of time" that "if Whitman is poetry, this is poetry." Nonetheless, however sympathetic Merrill is to Ginsberg, he comes across finally as an academician, and a Christian one at that, who gives little evidence here of being really equipped or ready to wrestle radically with Ginsberg's deepest concerns. Even if I had the space, I do not quite know how to get at these deeper concerns. I could easily try in the approved manner:- Merrill has a good grasp of certain neo-orthodox Christian categories in dis- cussing the religious dimension of Ginsberg's poetry, but might not that very resourcc- and especially the Western Christian assumptions about nature and history be precisely one dichotomy Ginsberg is beyond? In this regard, Walter F. Otto's The Homeric Gods would provide a useful propaedeutic to the Western mind on its journey to etc. Or. Merrill, like most Westerners, seems oblivious to the crucial importance of the kinds of directions and visions about which Ginsberg is speaking. We seem unaware that the East has developed tools for exploring religious reali- ties as incredibly refined and accurate as the Western tools for exploring prosaic realities. Not that Ginsberg has these tools. But he is moving in a direction which etc. But that kind of thing cannot help us. Academically one-upping Merrill is not the way. Suggesting other writers Sri Aurobindo, Bachofen, Holderlin, Rilke, Heidegger, Norman O. Brown-might be of assistance. But not finally. Finally no academic exercise can explore the depths. Merrill tries half-heartedly, fails, and then resigns himself to giving a thorough though 806</page><page sequence="101">ambivalent account of Ginsberg's poetry as poetry. The most that can be said for this book is that it might encourage its readers to turn to Gins- berg. What then, once one has read Ginsberg? Can this review suggest more? How? I want you to read Ginsberg, though not merely as a poet rather as a fellow seeker for truth, a lover of wisdom, a brother philo-sopher. Even Merrill, quoting Ginsberg, speaks of this dimension as "Ginsberg's declaration of intent: 'I have no formal ideology at all; these ideas I present to people to make them think about themselves!"' ln the late Forties, Ginsberg abjured that which was "an imitation of . . . Iiterary cackle" (Empty Mirror, p. 9). Thus, explication, criticism, analysis, evalu- ation are irrelevant. Instead, thinking is called for. But certainly not the cogito of Western consciousness, not rationality (by what warrant was it determined that ratio is the measure of being-human?), not logical opera- tions (logic is not the only tuning of logos). Rather, Heidegger's anden- kende Denken, re-collective thinking, thoughtfully reappropriating one's being. Or prophecy, telling-forth. Or poetry, poetic thinking. Even in the Forties in Empty Mirror, Ginsberg had known that he must wait for a moment when the poem itself is my way of speaking out, not declaiming or celebrating, yet, but telling the truth. That is Ginsberg's quest, a journey which has taken him necessarily through painful self-examination, long agonies of external and internal discipline, sacrifice, visions, drugs, breakdowns, social protests, with- drawal from the world, immersion in the world, leaving on the way such powerfully instructive landmarks as "Siesta in Xbalba," Howl, "Sather Gate Illumination," "Kaddish," "Journal Night Thoughts," "The Change: Kyoto-Tokyo Express," "Who Be Kind To," "Wichita Vortex Sutra," "Wales Visitation," and others. He is still on the way toward telling truth, toward how one achieves such vision, beyond which one can then cele- brate. This surely is a journey we all must learn from. Even Merrill calls attention to the most fundamental characteristic of Ginsberg's work "energy," that energy which is the immense impelling motive power for his journey. But Merrill forgets Blake's "Energy is Eternal Delight," and his "Exuberance is Beauty," and his "The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. Prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by Incapacity." While Ginsberg nursed at Blake's side, the academicians were shocked by his excess, his exuberance, his beauty, his energy. We may comfort ourselves by courting the rich old academic bitch success with irrelevant and impotent reviews and books. But when will we "groan thru breast and neck, a great Oh! to earth heart / Calling our Presence together," and learn that "the great secret is no secret / Senses fit the winds, / Visible is visible"?

Reviewed by JAMES C. McLAREN, University of Delaware This is the first book in English to treat, exclusively, the dramatic works of Jean Giraudoux whose subtle re-thinking of myth and legend has brought an almost unequalled blending of style and content to the con- temporary theater. Mr. Cohen has organized his study around the dramatist's concern for dialectics: the clashes, both verbal and physical, between Man and Destiny. While his conclusions seem sometimes exaggerated, the organi- zation and analysis of the materials are quite excellent. The division of the plays into three basic categories sexual, metaphysical and political is sound since the chronological approach so necessary to the linking of an author's works to his private life, public positions and the events of his time is still preserved. Each of the three groupings of four plays (twelve in all) covers a span of some fifteen years: 1930-1944. This allows the reader to trace Giraudoux's development in an evolving historical and biographical context while he follows, at the same time, the close textual analysis and comparison of plays that fall logically into a given thematic structure. Some of Cohen's more original, perhaps controversial, comments are worth noting. The strange play ludith and its creation of an artificial "Saint" is autobiographical, reflecting "the defeated promises of youth." For Lucretia forms a curious, triple analogy: the destruction of the Roman Empire and the founding of the Republic are linked to Napoleon lil and the events of 1870 and then, again, to the German occupation of France in the 1940's. He sees beyond the fantasy of Ondine the tragic impact of the incompatible worlds of Dream and Reality. Giraudoux, in Electra, views war as inevitable, yet, more positively than in The Trojan War . . ., he looks forward to the eventual Gaullist regeneration of France out of the ashes and immorality of the 1940's. Against the frequent opinion that The Madwoman of Chaillot is whimsically removed from real events and is political and social only in a cosmic sense, Cohen has a good case for its allusions to the Nazi occupation of Paris and the inroads of industrial, urban life on individualism and rural identity. "The cruelty of the mecs [pimps: invaders] is far more than the cruelty of ordinary capitalists; it is the behavior of a spiteful Nazi empire." And the Adolphe Bertaut of this play (1942) underlines the rejection by Giraudoux, the former Ger- manophile of Siegfried (1928), of the cruel, uncultured Germany of Adolf Hitler. The chapter on Giraudoux's style correctly stresses the dialectical rather than the mimetic structure of his theater where, as opposed to an Oedipus searching for, finding, and resolving his destiny, one has a situation that is "nonactive, ambiguous in its conclusions, and complex in its structure." Giraudoux admitted he lacked the poetic power and epic sweep for classical tragedy. And one would agree with Cohen that his theater is "more aesthetic than intellectual" and is based, primarily, 808</page><page sequence="103">on the stylistic interplay of fantasy and reality. But this judgment is only relative. For like Gide, Cocteau, and other re-interpreters of myth, he has, one feels, deliberately sacrificed Sophoclean pathos and tragedy to the dramatic springs of intellectual, ideological debate. He would have agreed with Gide's reference to his own play Oedipus: "My aim is not to make you tremble or cry, but to make you reflect." There is, indeed, a strong dramatic tension in Giraudoux's theater that makes one question Cohen's statement that "dramatically speaking, Giraudoux is an atheist." If Giraudoux were an atheist the Gods would not exist, as they clearly do in such plays as The Trojan War . . .. Amphytrion 38 and The Apol/o of Bellac. They are often absurd and illogical, but they are not impotent. If they were, then the dramatic tension between Man and Destiny so basic to Giraudoux's theater- would fade away. What Giraudoux has done is to humanize the Gods, remove them from their pinnacles on Olympus, and give them an all too human vulnerability. Only by debunking and yet maintaining the Deity could Giraudoux bring Gods and men onto a relatively equal plane where his stylistic, dramatic debate could function: between Jupiter and Alcmena or between Apollo and Agnes. The tragic pathos of Greek drama kept the Gods and Man poles apart, the punishers and the punished. In Giraudoux's theater the gulf is bridged, or almost so, and Man has a chance to act and react. He is not always the victor, but neither is he, inevitably, the vanquished. If the Gods are often creatures of the Absurd, they are certainly not obsolete; and they provide, in their debate with men, the existential spring of the Giralducien drama. A second cloudy spot in an otherwise bright and clear book involves Cohen's exaggeration of the pessimism in Giraudoux's plays. In his final pages he says, without reservation: "He presented life as a cruel and tragic adventure, a continual frustration, which could only be assuaged by suicide." This places Giraudoux, too conveniently and quite incor- rectly, in the dark, cruel company of Artaud, Genet and Anouilh. Cohen is trying here to make Giraudoux the precursor of all the grim trends in contemporary drama. This position overlooks his earlier insistence on Giraudoux as a promoter of Franco-German friendship, his concern for a renaissance in French moral and political life, and the constructive themes of peace, rural beauty and individualism that one finds throughout his writings. The Madwoman of Chaillot ends in a victory for the human and eccentric. Alcmena's simple, domestic bliss (Amphitryon 38) proves stronger than Jupiter's tricks and disguises. Agnes (Apollo of Bellac) accepts the limited, human world of her tiny staircase rather than the absolute world of the God Apollo. This is not a defeat but an honest admission that the finite and the infinite cannot be reconciled. Judith's murder of Holofernes is inspired not by divine will but by personal whim, and her"sanctity," however ambiguous and absurd, is finally a human rationalization rather than the deterministic outcome of prophecy. In the Trojan War, it is true, the irrationality of Fate and its human accom- plices wins out. But Hector, Ulysses, and Andromache remain the positive spokesmen for peace and domestic happiness. And if indeed Giraudoux had seen life as essentially cruel and tragic, then dark humor and diatribe would have replaced whimsy, preciosity, fantasy and humaneness as the 809 </page><page sequence="104">vehicles of despair. As Giraudoux has written (Combat avec l'ange). "Those who have not been born to the world know nothing of the mis- fortunes of life; those who live in this world know about its joys . . . and . . . Providence knows how to keep a perfect balance between being and nothingness." Cohen's book is, in all, a valuable contribution to the understanding of Jean Giraudoux, one of the most important dramatists of modern times. His critical, sensitive approach to the plays, his careful textual analysis and his original method of organizing materials in aesthetic, historical and biographical contexts far outweigh the heaviness of some of his conclusions.

Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1969. 116 pp. 18/- cloth, 10/- pb. Reviewed by BERNARD F. DICK, Fairleigh Dickinson University It is claimed on the dust-jacket of Babb's book that this is "the first to examine the forms and meanings in all of Golding's fiction up through The Pyramid." But that distinction belongs to Leighton Hodson's study of 1969. Unlike many series that are little more than plot synopses for the literate, "Writers and Critics" is actually aimed at the reader who does not require chapter-by-chapter explication. Compression and selectivity are the main features of the series, and it is a pleasure to report that Hodson has written a thorough study of Golding within the space limitations that his book must observe. Biographical data is given at the beginning, and the novels are then treated chronologically from Lord of the Flies (1954) to The Pyramid (1967). The essays are not discussed separately, but are incorporated into the biographical introduction be- 810</page><page sequence="105">cause of their personal nature. Little is made of The Brass Butterfly, and with good reason; it is not particularly distinguished theatre. While some critics have drawn improbable parallels between the novels of Golding and those of other writers whom he never read, Hodson only makes comparisons that are appropriate but not definitive. For example, he compares Pincher Martin with Alberich, the dwarf who stole the gold from the Rhine Maidens in the prologue to Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelungs. Although Martin moves his bowels to Wagnerian strains, Hodson does not argue for an influence on the basis of musically accompanied defecation. However, the comparison is apt, for Wagner himself regarded Alberich as the prototype of the nineteenth-century materialist just as Golding considered Martin as the personification of the modern sensualist. Hodson views The Pyramid as the beginning of Golding's "tragic- comic" phrase where the classicism of the early fiction, especially the ascent toward self-knowledge, is localized in the familiar setting of a class-conscious English community. The moral ambiguity of Golding's universe where the victor is often the victim is also discussed with a measure of sympathy that shows Hodson has understood the Hellenic- Christian tension that polarizes so much of the fiction. In short, this is an admirable study whose brevity belies its depth. Howard Babb's reading of The Pyramid is literary criticism at its most ingenious, for his method works best with a work where analogues do not have to be established and where the towering figure evoked by the title is really a bloated triangle in disguise. In his treatment of Golding's fiction, Babb avoids detailed comparisons with the so-called sources or points of departure. This is the method which Golding himself prefers, for he firmly believes that "one book does not come out of another unless it is stillborn." Yet a comparative approach can actually enrich a novel's meaning by showing its debt to its literary predecessors. Despite the Lord of the Flies cult during the early 1960's and the extravagant praise it received in Academe, the novel was by no means the cosmic work graduate assistants and their elders claimed it was in Freshman English. If it is read as a microcosmic Bacchae or as a post-Hiroshima Coral Island, Lord of the Flies acquires a sophisti- cation that comes when a work has been placed in the proper tradition. By admitting his debt to Greek tragedy and Ballantyne, Golding has invited the kind of comparative criticism which Lord of the Flies has received. Babb's chapter on Lord of the Flies is frankly unsatisfactory, yet his insistence on examining the novel's narrative (as opposed to mythic) structure indicates that there may be nothing else to say about the book. Furthermore, Lord of the Flies is a novel where symbolism is welded to the narrative. The main events (the discovery of the conch, the setting of the fire, the breaking of the glasses, the pig-hunt, and so on) are all symbolic or at least archetypal. Golding's ability to align action and symbol is precisely why the novel is such a good introduction to litera- ture; he makes symbolism a natural outgrowth of the plot rather than a pretentious afterthought. The discussion of Pincher Martin is more successful. Babb's reading of 811</page><page sequence="106">the last chapter is unusually perceptive. He argues that Mr. Davidson, who claims Martin's body, is actually Oeath. With this interpretation, the novel emerges as the disguised morality play one always thought it was, and at the same time remains one of the bleakest visions of unredeemed man in contemporary literature. His treatment of Free Fall does not resolve one's ambivalence about it (the plot is worthy of an MGM scenario of the 1940's), yet there are times when some of the prose reads like strangely paginated poetry. Babb has isolated poetic elements in the opening paragraph, and his dis- cussion is a model for analyzing prose rhythm in fiction. While Babb discovers nothing startlingly new in The Inheritors and The Spire, he provides a brilliant interpretation of The Pyramid. First, he knows that two of the three episodes were published separately, a fact that eluded most of the critics. More important, he realizes that the relationships in a Golding novel are always quite complex; they are described so economically that one must dissect the text along with the character. Anyone puzzled by Evie's "curious slip of the tongue" will find an explanation that does justice to a novelist who refuses to be conventional even when his story line is. Biles, Jack I.

Reviewed by RICHARD C. CARPENTER, Bowling Green State University Further testimony that this is still an age of criticism is provided by this little collection of contemporary reviews, supplemented by some letters and interviews with Hardy. It should be useful for readers who want to know more about the critical controversy surrounding Tess and Jude, and who do not have access to the much more extensive Critical Heritage collection of Hardy materials. Over half the book is concerned with the reception given these two novels, and provides enlightenment as to the range of responses. Tess was on the whole highly praised, despite some criticisms concerning the grimness of Fate; Jude was attacked, sometimes 814</page><page sequence="109">scurrilously in a fashion that might call for libel action nowadays. On the other hand it was defended very intelligently by men of substance such as Howells, Edmund Gosse, and Havelock Ellis. A fair selection of critical reviews of Far From the Madding Crowd shows how persistent was the notion that Hardy was imitating George Eliot, while the collection as a whole clearly illustrates the assumptions of Victorian reviewers that novels shotild be rnorally instructive and amusing, and have happy endings and '/realistic" characters without too many psychological quirks, as well as the dominant assumption that the reviewers were appointed to instruct and berate erring novelists. The criteria for including or excluding selections seem to be whimsical at best, the principal standard apparently being "interest." There is very little on important novels such as The Mayor of Casterbridge or The Woodlanders, and nothing on novels like the Trumpet Major and A Pair of Blue Eyes, although there are selections about Desperate Remedies and Under the Greenwood Tree. The critical comments are sometimes helpful, more often irritating, with references to reviews not included or unneces- sary comment on those that are included and which we can read for ourselves.

THE DRAGON IN THE GATE: STUDIES IN THE POETRY OF G. M. HOPKINS. University of California Press, 1968. 224 pp. $5.95. Reviewed by HAROLD F. MOSHER, University of Nice These books serve different purposes. Elisabeth Schneider's volume, of which three chapters have been published previously in various journals, is a specialized study of Hopkins's rhythms, the causes of his obscurity, and the features of his two styles. Donald McChesney's Commentary analyzes poem by poem most of Hopkins's work, whereas Schneider concentrates on The Wreck of the Deutschland, "The Windhover," "Spelt from Sibyl'.s Leaves," "That Nature Is a Heraclitean Fire and of the Comfort of the Resurrection," "Andromeda," and the "terrible sonnets." Schneider rather assumes a knowledge in her reader not only of Hop- 820</page><page sequence="115">kins's oeuvre but of the important criticism as well; McChesney, on the other hand, is writing for the "average student" and even for the reader whose "culture and language is not British nor even European," though McChesney, in providing background material, is not forgetting the ad- vanced student. Thus his book has few surprises, restricting itself as it does to more or less standard readings of the poems as established by previous critics, especially on questions of meter. Schneider, however, sets out to correct past mistakes and examine neglected areas, particularly in her study of the Deutschland's meaning and of the relation between sprung rhythm and conventional meter. If McChesney's book errs on the side of pedestrianism, Schneider's makes its few errors because of a com- mitment to a thesis. Nevertheless, this latter study is the more interesting, provocative, and original, which is not to say that McChesney's study is without value. One of the cruxes in Hopkins criticism is the difficulty with the theory and practice of sprung rhythm. As Schneider points out, Hopkins's own methods of scansion changed during his career from considering sprung rhythm to consist of rising feet (iambs, anapests), a theory held during the composition of the Deutschland, to the later theory of considering sprung feet to be falling (trochees, dactyls). One might object to Schneid- er's choice of following Hopkins's earlier method of scansion on the grounds that it does not accord with his practice during the greater parl of his productive life and, consequently, that scansion according to the predominant rising rhythm of English poetry would create problems in identifying sprung rhythm which is basically a counterpoint rhythm of reversed or falling feet. I would, nevertheless, accept Schneider's arbitrary choice because more often than not Hopkins's rhythms can be scanned more naturally as rising than falling. Hopkins himself adopted the later system merely for the sake of convenience in scansion, an arbitrary choice based on musical theory. But poetry is not music, and it is more accurate to scan, dividing feet if possible on the basis of speech stresses and pauses rather than on the basis of some imposed theoretical system. Meter is, after all, an abstraction from more complicated rhythm and should try to be as faithful to the spoken performance of a poem as possible, especially in the case of Hopkins's admittedly oratorical verse. We can see in poems like "The Windhover" Hopkins's own readings of those poems in which he placed stresses that wrench the rhythm un- naturally for the sake of a musical pattern. Such scannings Schneider rightly eschews because either one must ignore Hopkins's markings to scan the poem according to the later principles of sprung rhythm, or, if one accepts the poet's indicated stressing, one is forced to acknowledge that his theory of falling paeonic feet does not apply. Schneider faces the problem squarely and admits that there are passages "in which Hopkins's rhythms can be described only as eccentric in their arbitrary handling of the relation between sense and meter, passages marked to be read in ways that I think cannot be justified in terms of rhythm . . . or of any imaginable meaning, however subtle." In this respect the conservative readings of McChesney do not advance our understanding of Hopkins's rhythms, for this writer is for the most part content to repeat either Hopkins's or some critic's descriptions of the meters without comment 821</page><page sequence="116">G. M. HOPKINS In a book intended primarily for "the average student who wishes to come to a better understanding of the poet," McChesney's discussion of sprung rhythm seems inadequate. He describes it essentially as accentual meter with alliteration but says nothing of the different types of feet which Hopkins mentions and, what is worse, gives no illustrative scansion of a Hopkins poem although he gives "Three Blind Mice" as an exam- ple of the principle of sprung rhythm. Hopkins's sprung rhythm, however, is much more complex than that of a nursery rhyme, and it would have been helpful for the "average student" to have a sample scansion of one of Hopkins's poems. Likewise, McChesney's short dis- cussion of the "rove-over" lines does not clearly distinguish this feature from simple enjambment; probably to Hopkins "rove-over" meant a foot divided at the end of a line. (Schneider's treatment of this term is also inadequate although she does point out Hopkins's intention to separate rove-over endings from enjambment.) McChesney's book suffers gen- erally from a failure of precise definition, especially in view of its audi- ence. The meaning of special terms like "cynghanedd" and "vowell chime" must be inferred by the reader from abbreviated discussions and examples sometimes scattered through the text. Some traditional terms- consonance and alliteration or ode and elegy, to give two pairs of examples- seem to be used synonymously. On other occasions, Mc- Chesney goes to the opposite extreme of explaining the obvious, as in his gloss of '@hourglass" in the fourth stanza of the Deutschland: "shaped like a large egg-timer, sand trickling through a narrow neck in the glass." If, on one hand, we accept his apology that such remarks are directed to readers whose native language is not English, we must, on the other hand, observe that a book addressed to such readers as well as to "the more advanced student" will of necessity lose its focus. Indeed, one might ask for whom and for what reason tkcChesney "explains" a line from "God's Grandeur" "like the ooze of oillCrushed" with "like the ooze of oil from crushed olives." In his eagerness to appeal to many readers, McChesney ends by helping only a few. Schneider's treatment of sprung rhythm is marred somewhat by another type of oversimplification and by a too close adherence to her thesis. Because she believes that Hopkins's most successful use of sprung rhythm occurs in the Deutschland and that this success depends on the existence of a ground rhythm made up of conventional feet, she often arranges her scansion of the poem to emphasize a conventional metrical pattern, in this case mainly anapestic/iambic or, failing this, some sort of accentual pattern. The resulting lack of flexibility in her approach leads her into an argument with Gardner about where to put the two stresses in the first line of the poem and the three stresses in the second line. It seems to me that Gardner's solution of a secondary stress allows him more accurately to indicate the actual rhythm and still suggest the pattern of the predominant meter. Why, for the sake of the metrical pattern, should one be overly concerned about an extra stress in each of the first two lines when the pattern is eventually established later on, when Hopkins might very likely have wanted to slow his opening two lines with three and four stresses respectively, and when Hopkins said that the line is not the basis of the metrical pattern? If the difficulty of placement of stress is, as Schneider 822</page><page sequence="117">silggests, involved with meaning, and not just with establishing a metrical pattern, the reader of Hopkins should always allow meaning to guide him in stressing. When, however, neither meaning nor meter is clear, the reliance on a predetermined pattern scanned by the conventional two- stress system may not bring out the true rhythm in sprung patterns. Rather, a more sophisticated three or four-stress system will more ac- curately reflect the true rhythm from which may be abstracted a simpler meter to indicate the pattern/ as I have demonstrated elsewhere. I think that if Schneider had used such a method she would not have been forced to conclude that where the meter cannot be found by con- ventional methods it is not clear. Hopkins expected his poetry to be read aloud to bring out the prose-like rhythms determined by meaning, as Schneider herseif points out. The difficulties that arise notably in her attempts to relate sprung rhythm to the conventional anapestic meters of Swinburne (see in particular pages 52-53) may be due to her apparent confusion of meter and rhythm. She tries to make the slashes that divide feet do the double duty of indicating rhythm and meter: that is, express breath pauses as well as ends of feet. Though meter is related to rhythm, they are not identical, and pauses do not always come at the end of feet. This same confusion seems to reappear in her discussion of lines 3 and 8 in the twelfth stanza of the Deutschland where, she says, "the phrasing becomes amphibrachic though the ground rhythm remains anapestic." No doubt, Schneider means "rhythm" by "phrasing" and "meter" by "ground rhythm." Hopkins, himself, recognized the dif- ference between meter and rhythm in a letter to Robert Bridges, which Schneider quotes: "I forgot to answer about my metres (rhythms rather, I suppose)." Thus Schneider's attempt to explain the success of sprung rhythm in the Deutschland by linking its rhythms with an anapesticl iambic meter scanned by a conventional, over-simplified two-stress sys- tem gives in some cases unsatisfactory results because sometimes Hop- kins's rhythms defy conventional metrical patterns. The fault does noi necessarily lie with Hopkins's rhythms but with the inadequate instru- ment called in to measure them. I do not mean to leave the impression, however, that Schneider's discussion of sprung rhythm is without value. Certainly, sprung rhythm is closely linked with conventional meters, and Schneider's comparison of the Deutschland rhythms with Swinburne's and other nineteenth century poets' experiments in anapestic meters helps to put Hopkins in the tradition of English poetry and allows us to understand better the difference between sprung rhythm and free verse, among other things. Sometimes, then, when Schneider finds that the rhythm does not conform with her conception of what it should be, she labels it unclear. Of course, Hopkins's rhythms are not aXways clear, but one feels oc- casionally that Schneider makes problems where they do not exist. For example, to demonstrate her thesis about the ambiguity of Hopkins's syntax, she insists on the confusion of point of view in "The Starlight Night" instead of.trying to clarify it, as one might, by explaining the identification of sky and earth as a deliberate fusing of them by the poet to dramatize his repeated theme of the ubiquity of beauty revealing the presence of Christ. Elsewhere, problems are created when Schneider 823</page><page sequence="118">G. M. HOPKINS provides the reader with too little information, a fault shared by Mc- Chesney. Both writers evaluate impressionistically at times, failing either to explain their judgments or to demonstrate them with illustrations. Schneider finds "Hurrahing in Harvest" to be the least successful met- rically of the experimental sonnets without saying why and "In the Valley of the Elwy" to be among the most successful because its meter is "self-evident." Personally I do not find the meter so clear, particularly in lines 4 and 5 and in line 13, where a stress on "O" would make six stresses in the line. Clearly, not everything can be demonstrated in a book of 200 pages, but one would have hoped for less discussion of, say, the Deutschland and amplification of remarks on other poems like "Felix Randall," "Spring and Fall," and "Carrion Comfort," as well as some recognition of the dramatic element in many of the sonnets. Mc- Chesney is also guilty of omissions. One would certainly expect in a book which pretends to give a "detailed analysis" of the poems some mention, for example, of the speaker's questioning his own pride in "Carrion Comfort." Or one would expect some support for such impressionistic assertions as the following concerning "God's Grandeur": "There is a carefully wrought rhetorical splendour in the line, effected by a pattern- ing of vowel and consonant sequences, that seems to put it above charges of emotionalism." Finally both Schneider and McChesney are occa- sionally guilty of the biographical fallacy. The former relies somewhat on the facts of Hopkins's own conversion for her interpretation of the Deutschland as a poem about hope for England's conversion. McChesney sometimes gives a bogus explanation of a line by referring it to Hopkins's life as in this "gloss" of "lashed rod" in stanza two of the Deutsch/and: "always a toughness about Hopkins, despite frail physique." What seems to me to be the most serious omission in both books is the failure to consider imagery in the analysis of the Deutschland. Only briefly does SlcChesney connect images of lashing and suffering with God's justice and images of fire, ripeness, and water with salvation and mercy. Schneider sacrifices discussion of this aspect of the poem in favor of developing her thesis that it is about the conversion of the poet and of England. Although her reading of the poem is an interesting and valid one, I believe an examination of its imagery would support another, more comprehensive interpretation that of a questioning and eventual acceptance of God's double nature of mercy and justice, a theme treated by Hopkins in other poems. Although Schneider herself admits the im- portance of imagery in relation to meaning, she largely ignores it both in the Deutsch/and and in "The Windhover," where the images of sacrifice pointed out by McChesney would emphasize another interpretation only touched on by Schneider. But I do not wish to leave a totally unfavorable opinion of these two books, especially Schneider's, whose virtues outweigh its defects. Besides her illuminating discussion of nineteenth century metrics and of Hop- kins's place in the Victorian tradition and her honest appraisal of metrical difficulties, particularly that of the problem of establishing a pattern in sprung rhythm, her identification of Hopkins's baroque and plain styles, her convincing defense of Bridges' part in the composition and publication of Hopkins's poetry, and her review of the sources of its obscurity are 824</page><page sequence="119">valuable contributions to Hopkins criticism. McChesney's book, though flawed basically because of its wish to appeal to too wide an audience, provides some helpful glosses and prints extrinsic material that shows how Hopkins transmuted prose from his journals into poetry. The book's appeal, however, is more or less limited to undergraduates. Mariani, Paul L. A COMMENTARY ON THE COMPLETE POEMS OF GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS. Cornell University Press, 1970. 362 pp. $10. Reviewed by ROBERT BOYLE, S. J., Marquette University It would be difficult to avoid superlatives in reviewing this book. It is one of the best commentaries I have ever read, and certainly the most thorough and satisfactory dealing with Hopkins's poems which has yet appeared. Mariani's grasp of the texts; his imaginative re-creations of the Victorian atmosphere and of Hopkins's own experiences, thoughts, and feelings; his helpful juxtaposition of the text of the poems and of apt selections from Hopkins's prose writings; his clear and muscular ex- pression of his own critical insights and speculations all these, and other things besides, compel admiration. In his Introduction, he states his aim, to give modern readers of Hop- kins a clear explication which will help them to wrestle with whatever dragons they find. He wisely intends to center on rhythms, which he categorizes in three groups: the wavelike tensions of Hopkins's conver- sion, alternating between languor and crispness, found most frequently in the Oxford juvenalia; the excited rhythms and ecstatic climaxes ot the 1876-1883 poems, dealing with sacramental vision; the harsh, weary, or quiet rhythms of the 1885-1889 poems, dealing with the poet's finding Christ in himself. In the first chapter, "Early Poetry and Elected Silence, 1860-75," he analyzes the early poems and fragments. Incisive, stimulating, balanced critical judgments, together with interesting speculations and useful com- parisons with other Victorian poets, make this a valuable chapter. It is easy to agree, on most solid grounds, with his conclusion that if Hopkins had continued in the ways in which he began "he might have become a silver-age George Herbert...." Chapter Two presents a helpful and attractive guide through The Wreck of the Deutschland. Almost everything is sensitively responsive to the text, wide-ranging and yet beautifully controlled. The probable presence of the Zeus-Danae myth in "fall-gold mercies" (a myth Hopkins was fond of, as "Andromeda" attests), and the implications of "down-dugged" are skimped, and the enthusiastic acceptance of Elisabeth Schneider's tykish supposition that the nun was favored with a miraculous presence of Christ actually walking across the waters seems to me a flaw. But it is carping to complain about anything in a commentary so satisfactorily illuminating. Particularly good are the treatments of "steady as a water in a well" as "a perfect image of God's paradoxical dynamic stasis," and of the "Word" as giving meaning not only to the shipwreck but to the cosmos. 825</page><page sequence="120">Chapter Three discusses the ten Welsh sonnets. In his effort to date the sonnets, Mariani presents convincing evidence for differing from MacKenzie's ordering. Some uses of Miltonic rhythms receive good if brief treatment. He presents original, sometimes brilliant, insights: the double service of "then" in "Why do men then now not reck his rod," in the meanings of "therefore" and "in the past"; the patterns in "The Starlight Night," including even an alphabetical one; his clear perception of the overtones in the body-rainbow image in "The Caged Skylark"; etc. His reading of "The Windhover: to Christ our Lord," granted the pre- suppositions he adopts, is profound, but of course not definitive (one might as well expect the heart of Hamlet's mystery to be plucked out). Mariani joins those who suppose that the "literal meaning" of the poem revea-ls that the /'buckle" is the "downward swoop" of the falcon a ,3ossible, indeed, but to my mind somewhat simplistic reading. But agree- ment on that great sonnet will never flower in this valley of tears. All of the readings, in any case, illuminate and reveal rare new beauties in the poems. Chapter Four presents good readings of "Duns Scotus's Oxford" (though I judge it is the brick buildings, not the Isis, which form the "brickish skirt") and of "Andromeda," but I must quarrel with the reading of the conclusion of the "Eurydice." Mariani reads "seemingly fresh death"; I read it as "fresh prayer" with "seeming" as a substantive fresh prayer is appropriate for those sunk, in the past, in seeming (e.g., the uncanonized, those whose final disposition is, to our limited vision, not certain). And the odd supposition that The Month rejected the poem because Hop- kins wants prayer to a living Christ actually to visit the English waters stems, I fear, solely from Miss Schneider's alleged "miracle" in the Deutschland. Chapter Five, "The Lean Years," affords to "Felix Randall" the best treatment that somewhat neglected poem has had. Mariani suggests, with admirable insight, that there is an underlying comparison between the priest preparing ("randalizing") the dying blacksmith for a non-random road, and the young blacksmith formerly preparing the horse for its con- fident journey. He deals well, too, if briefly, with the other 1880-1884 poems, particularly"Kingfishers," the humorous triolets, and "The B.V.M. Compared to Air." Chapter Six treats the poems of desolation in original and enlighten- ing fashion, with exactly the right touch throughout. Of particular interest are his treatment of the sequence formed by the six "terrible" sonnets, a Dantean motion away from and back toward God, and his insightful discussion of Hopkins's achievements, psychic and metric, in his "St. Winefred" fragments. Chapter Seven scans the other 1885 poems, with a good treatment of the beautiful "Ashboughs," which, as Mariani rightly notes, should not be relegated to the fragments. In Chapter Eight, the treatment of "Harry Ploughman" is on a level with the "Felix Randal" criticism, or even higher. It is the kind of creative criticism that lifts the mind and ear to a new level, and makes one under- stand and hear as if for the first time the magnificent unity of a complex, metaphorical, and powerful poem. Almost as good are his analyses of 826</page><page sequence="121">"Tom's Garland" and "Heraclitean Fire." He sees, and makes us see, Hopkins's final sonnets as representing his advantage of himself over himself. Slightly more could be done with the implications of "To R.B.," I believe, but certainly the beautiful "The shepherd's brow" receives the full critical a,spreciation for which it has waited so long. Two useful appendices, on "Hopkins and the Sonnet" and "A Note on Hopkins' Prosody," and a bibliography complete the book. I imagine it is clear that I judge this handsome book to be a most important and valuable addition to Hopkins studies. It should be put out in paperback as well, so that students in Hopkins or in Victorian courses could have it in hand as they work through the fourth edition of the Poems. The confident and attractive presentation tends to charm the mind, making the reading of the book a complete pleasure. I was profitably drawn out, without pain, from opinions and attitudes I have held for thirty years or more, and I recommend the experience as a heady one. Room should be made for this splendid book on every literary bookshelf. Seelhammer, Ruth. HOPKINS COLLECTED AT GONZAGA. Chicago: Loyola University Press, 1970. 272 pp. $8.00.

Southern Illinois University Press, 1969. 144 PP. $4.95. Reviewed by DANIEL J. SCHNEIDER, Windham College Critical commentary on Henry James's fictton has accumulated so densely over the past three decades that one might reasonably expect any new study to present a fresh critical insight into James's art, or a fresh perspective on itt or some new information to compel a reassessment of the existing scholarship. James Kraft's book, concentrating on James's novels and tales in the period from 1864 to 1880, is meant to comple- ment the previous work on this period, particularly that by Cornelia P. Kelley and Leon Edel. What is best about the book, as Harry T. Moore notes in his Introduction, is the stress on James's "evolving sense of morality" as related to "the development of his artistic vision." For it is unquestionably true, as Kraft holds, that the moral ideal of "living life" and of transcending the "narrow restraints" of "individuals, societies, and nations" is central to any understanding of what James was trying to do in these early stories, and central, indeed, to the whole development of his fiction. But such a point has been made many times- by Ezra Pound, Joseph Warren Beach, Marius Bewley, Quentin Anderson, Sally Sears- 829</page><page sequence="124">HENRY JAMES and so the chief question regarding Kraft's new study is whether, in examining these early stories, he develops the central insight in such a way as significantly to deepen our understanding and appreciation of James's art. On this count, the book is unsuccessful. Kraft sets out to "gain a clearer understanding of the foundations of James's fiction and to suggest the evolution of his art." As he moves from "The Apprentice Years" (1864-1868) to the. period of "The Determined Artist" (1876-1880) his method is to summarize plots and then to discuss aspects of the stories related to James's artistic development. It is of course essential in such analysis to preserve the integrity of the stories even as one uses them to illustrate "evolution." But in Kraft's study formal analysis is frequently adulterated by excursions outside the works themselves by what James might have called "queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary"-and our impressions of what James achieves, or fails to achieve, are more often blurred than sharpened. The weaknesses of the criticism are vivid in (for instance) the analyses of "Madame de Mauves," Roderick Hudson, and "Daisy Miller." Loose and baggy indeed are the logic and method by which Kraft concludes that in "Madame de Mauves" James condemns "the virtuous woman as much as the corrupt society" or by which the conflict in Roderick Hudson becomes, all too simply, a conflict between "art and life." with Hudson emerging as admirable and Rowland Mallet becoming "less sympathetic"; or by which "Daisy Miller" may be discussed without a single reference to the forces of convention and propriety massed against the heroine. Or consider a statement like the following: "James makes the artist in 'The Madonna of the Future' like Clement Searle in 'A Passionate Pilgrim,' too absurd to be representa- tive and too romantic to be real." Again and again one comes across such remarks in Kraft's book, and always one must ask whether the critic has not simply begged or ignored the central question of the work's nature and unity: does the work require a "representative" artist, does it require a "real" artist? If so, why? What is James trying to do? Again and again Kraft refuses to go to the artistic center of the story; and because his method allows of such arbitrary inclusions, one is forced to question almost all of his critical evaluations. Kraft's brief comments on James's use of multiple perspectives as a means of realizing his moral vision seem to me valuable, and one could wish that more had been done with this aspect of James's art. His stress on "living life" in James's early work is, I repeat, important. But this study, with its unimaginative synopses of story after story, will have little useful- ness either to the student or to the scholar of Henry James and least of all to "scholars of creative writing," who, the jacket tells us, will profit by it.

THE LUCID REFLECTOR: THE OBSERVER IN HENRY JAMES'S FIC- TION. Yale University Press, 1969. 266 pp. $6.75. Reviewed by BARRY MENIKOFF, University of Hawaii Ora Segal's purpose in The Lucid Reflector is to trace the development of the observer in James's fiction, the figure created by the author in order to report and comment upon the dramatic action for the benefit of the reader. Seven of her ten chapters are given over to the analysis of a single story or nouvelle; the remaining three are devoted to The Portrait of a Lady, The Sacred Fount, and The Golden Bowl. The first four chapters examine James's international fiction. The observer in these tales is a subordinate figure, someone who serves as the author's deputy or guide in order to aid us in interpreting the dramatic action. His single most important characteristic is his reliability. The reader is persuaded to share his point of view toward the characters and events in each case. For example: the attitude of the observer-narrator toward Clement Searle in A Passionate Pilgrim moves from ironic detachment to sympathetic identification. We undergo a change of attitude along with the narrator, and the tale becomes "a romantic rather than an ironic story of the American dream of England." In Madame de Mauves the observer is not the first-person narrator but the center of consciousness, Bernard Long- more, a character whose perception of the dramatic events is heightened by his own thoughts and conjectures. Longmore becomes implicated in the dramatic action; he wants to rescue his countryman, Madame de Mauves, from a "rigidly traditional" French family and an untenable mar- riage. His involvement in the drama makes him a more fully-developed character than the narrator in A Passionate Pilgrim, but it does not undermine his integrity nor call into question the reliability of his ob- servations. With The Portrait of a Lady James introduces Ralph Touchett, the most flexible figure among his early observers. Ralph's role in the novel is twofold: he is an objective witness to the action, adopting a manner toward Isabel which the reader will both appreciate and ap- propriate, and he is so deeply involved with her career that "watching Isabel act out her freedom constitutes his great personal adventure and fulfills the requirements of his imagination...." The two roles are not contradictory and are kept distinct within the narrative. In the first half of the novel Ralph serves as a "lucid reflector," providing us with a witty and illuminating commentary on the action; in the second half he becomes an interested party to the action. Ralph's participation in Isabel's drama, however, unlike Longmore's relation to Madame de Mauves, affects his judgment and perception: he fails in the end to understand or appreciate her decision to return to her husband. Mrs. Segal turns next to James's middle fiction. The Aspern Papers reveals a marked change in the role of the observer. At the beginning of the story he serves the same function as James's earlier first-person narra- tors; he records the scene and creates for us a sense of the past. But his passion, his obsession for the Aspern papers distorts his vision and af- fects his conduct. He becomes transformed in the course of the narrative from a "guiding intelligence" into a figure victimized by his own self- 831</page><page sequence="126">HENRY JAMES deception, a figure whose observations no longer serve the reader as effec- tive commentary but rather as revelations of his character. James returns to the third-person form in "The Liar." The observer here is Oliver Lyon, a portrait painter, who is also the dramatized center of consciousness. Lyon's role as observer, however, illustrates James's recent experience with first-person narration. He is not merely a reporter and interpreter of the action but a man whose compulsion to discover the relation between Mr. and Mrs. Capadose introduces a substantial doubt in the reader's mind as to whether his report can be trusted. Mrs. Segal views "The Liar" as a "characteristic transitional work" because the observer plays a dual role: he is both the author's deputy and the dramatic agent who contributes to the development of the narrative. Finally, in The Sacred Fountt the novel itself becomes a "dramatization of all the characteristic and congenital problems of the Jamesian observer.' The narrator here functions as an interpreter of the dramatic action while simultaneously serving as the subject of that action. His observations, however, do not discover for us the meaning of the events at Newmarch, nor do they unveil to us a portrait of his personality. Rather they force upon us the realization that uncertainty and doubt inhere in all observation, that we are all subject to idiosyncratic imaginations, and that our most profound truths or convictions may be nothing more than created fictions. I must admit to a certain awe at the labor and patience that has been invested in The Lucid Reflector. Mrs. Segal performs an extraordinary task in describing the narrative movement in each of the stories, and she makes acute and illuminating observations on the characters and events in the process. Yet what seems most surprising is how little her inordi- nate concern with technique yields in the way of interpretation. Her readings of the international stories, of The Aspern Papers and "The Liar," of "The Lesson of the Mastert' and @'The Author of Beltraffio," are all grounded in the conventional. None of them contains an idea that could not be gleaned from an introductory primer to James's work. Perhaps the technical description ought to justify itself. Mrs. Segal after all does record for our benefit the shifting authorial voices in each story. But this method, if it can indeed be called a method, fails her in the final two chapters. Her readings of The Golden Bowl and "The Beast in the Jungle" are flaccid, uninspired, and, on occasion, wrong. She focuses her discussion of The Golden Bowl on Fanny Assingham, surely one of the least profitable ways of approaching that complex work. In her dis- cussion of "The Beast in the Jungle" she discovers that the observer has virtually disappeared, that James has dramatized instead the con- sciousness of the protagonist, John Marcher. Rather than probe the meaning of this radical transformation of the observer, of why James suddently dispensed with a device he had so as- siduously cultivated in his writing through 1900, Mrs. Segal remains content to note the observation. She has been so intent upon tracing the development of narrative reliability as a technical matter that she cannot seem to find any means of dealing with James's fiction when that techni- cal matter ceases to interest him as it does in the later work. If Mrs. Segal had chosen to interpret the significance of james's narrative tech- nique, instead of drawing together a collection of technologic dis- 832</page><page sequence="127">cussions of ten arbitrarily selected novels and tales, then The Lucid Reflector might have been a better book. Shine, Muriel G. THE FICTIONAL CHILDREN OF HENRY JAMES. University of North Carolina Press, 1969. 192 pp. $7.50. Reviewed by MARTHA BANTA, University of Washington This book proves its right to be throughout most of its 192 pages, but whether it demonstrates its right to be with greatness is another matter. It is a quiet, sensible account that is seldom wrong-headed in its argu- ment that, by viewing Henry James's artistic use of the child, he "strengthens our conviction that his was a total vision of the human con- dition." The plan of the book is clear. The opening chapter gives a succinct, useful review of the literary treatment of children from Blake to the time of James's young manhood; distinctions are made between American and British attitudes, social and psychological as well as literary. The foundation is thus firmly laid for Mrs. Shine's contention that James came to use childhood that time of unhappiness, isolation, and threat- ened evil as a gauge to society's moral qualities. Almost from the start of his literary career James held the idea he later dramatized as one of his great literary themes: that the selfishness associated with the undeveloped consciousness is replaced by disinterested goodness only when the child grows wisc that is, when it "grows up" as a perceiving being. Mrs. Shine makes the telling point that, as a critic, the young James revealed a subtle awareness of the child's place in con- temporary fiction which his own stories of the period were unable to portray. And yet, as she shows how James moved over the years from imaginative simplicity to complexity, her own book mirrors much the same pattern. It progresses from the sluggish toward the practiced; but - unlike James she never takes time to reach the inspired. Much is offered as a potentiality in this book; frustratingly little is delivered. In Mrs. Shine's discussion of "Master Eustace" tho governess- narrator records how a mother's guilty and excessive love "slays" the son who in turn destroys her. It comes to mind, but not Mrs. Shine's, that in the "The Turn of the Screw" the earlier figures of the governess and the mother will merge into one character and James's abhorrence of per- missiveness and possessiveness will receive full dramatic play. In stressing American practices of faulty childrearing in "Daisy Miller," Mrs. Shine rightly focuses upon the pathos of Randolph Miller; yet her failure to treat his sister Daisy fully is unsettling when she continues her review of spoiled young girls with "Pandora." Pandora, she says, is an imperfect portrait of the Daisy-type, but what that type is has not been established and so the comparison is lost. Mrs. Shine can be very good. In her examination of "A London Life"- in which the children's lives are marred by their parents' careless im- morality to the point they no longer elicit pity the discussion goes far beyond hitherto trite equations between parental duty and social respon- sibility. But these spurts into insight are followed by observations inade- 833</page><page sequence="128">HENRY IAMES quate to the problems exacted by, for instance, The Bostonians, The Princess Casamassima, and The Golden Bowl. Weaknesses of argument and shallowness of background which tend to drain the book's real strengths lessen as Mrs. Shine moves into the best part of her book: the study of James's young girls and the dilemma he faced between his liking for well-brought-up young things and his urge to propel them toward onslaughts of knowledge. The chapter devoted to Maisie Farange is excellent as it examines James's insistence that will and self-discipline accompany feeling and perception. With Nanda of The Awkward Age, whom Mrs. Shine sees as the culmination of the best of James's sensitive girl-women, a good general discussion of the educational process follows; but, even here, can much be made of what might just as well have come from an educationalist's handbook? Only in her final pages does Mrs. Shine really indicate her study's latent powers when she ponders the ways in which James's fictional children are not like "real children." Untouched by that flawing bitterness to which their treatment would naturally bring them, they symbolize the ideal state (this, because they are ideal "adults" in terms of perception). The girl children and adolescents, especially, create inner defenses which let them transcend the sordid world; as artistic "types" they solve for James the question of how to gain "wholeness of self" while existing within "the duality and ambivalence of experience." The hugely im- portant matter of James's propensity to idealization is glanced at just as the book ends. We are not permitted to enjoy a testing of the ways in which James sealed off his special beings from ravagement by setting them up as symbolic creatures within a society symbolic of the forces of destruction (the fantasy of the ideal playing off against the fantasy of the horrific). What we are left with is a sensible resume of James's use of child and adolescent characters interspersed by remarks exciting in themselves or in what they suggest. (Is it more frustrating to read a book that never rises above the expected or one that continually discloses its potentiali- ties, only to cover them up by hurrying toward the generalized and uneventful?) Such a book as Mrs. Shine's competent in treatment, in- trinsically interesting in topic leads one to wonder about the current trend of scholarly-critical writing which values the brief, the cautious, the unambitious reference work that contains few sins of commission but many of omission. Henry James was not afraid to risk the stumblings of brilliance. Why are his interpreters? The rich material of James's memoirs is left largely unexplored when it might have given Mrs. Shine imaginative impetus, as well as factual data. She demurs, rightly, from making irresponsible guesses about the connections between James's life and his fiction. The only forays she makes into the biographical, however, are largely tutored by Leon Edel's studies of the effects James's strong mother and vacillating father had upon him. There is much more in A Small Boy and Others and Notes of a Son and Brother. James's fascination with orphans could have suggested why he often worked with children bereft of parents. When Mrs. Shine cites the fright felt by a small boy over James's too intent concentration upon his jacket buttons, cowid she not have referred to the deep em- 834</page><page sequence="129">barrassment which the small Henry experienced when Thackeray fixed upon his buttons? A minute point, to be sure, but it is indicative of some of the chances Mrs. Shine missed. In the end, the judgment placed upon The Fictiona/ Children of Henry James is one of missed chances.

According to B. C. Southam, General Editor of the Critical Heritage Series! the main purpose of this imposing new series is to bring together com- ment on major writers by their contemporaries and near-contemporaries as found not only in reviews and critical essays, but also in letters, memoirs, journals, and even marginalia. Most of the writers covered to date have been accommodated in single volumes, but for Joyce Robert Deming has required two substantial volumes and even then found it 837</page><page sequence="132">IAMES IOYCE necessary to be quite selective in choosing from the mass of material available. Most of the many entries are carefully excerpted from longer discussions, and an appendix lists many additional reviews and essays that have been excl uded enti rely. What remains, however, is a more than adequate record of Joyce's growing reputation during his lifetime. Deming presents the record in chronological order from the first recorded comment on Joyce as writer in a letter from AE to Yeats in 1902 to a selection of critical obituaries which appeared after Joyce's death in 1941. The chronicle would be an invaluable aid to Joyce scholars even if Deming had not provided a full index to the materials collected in which he cites not only Joyce's indi- vidual works, but episodes and characters within those works as well as general aspects of Joyce's writing such as realism, symbolism, linguistic experimentation, and so on. The result is an impressive example of how a book which at fi rst may appear to be only a scissors-and-paste job actually reflects extensive research, careful selection, and a thorough analysis of the contents. Judging from other volumes in the series, Deming did even more than was expected of him. He deserves our gratitude. Gross, John. JAMES JOYCE. Modern Masters. Viking Press, 1970. 102 pp. $4.95 cloth, $1.65 pb. The little books in Frank Kermode's Modern Masters series are intended to offer concise summations of the careers and impact of "the men who have changed and are changing the life and thought of our age." So far the pantheon is composed largely of men of action like Che Guevara or philosophers like Wittgenstein, Lukacs, and Marcuse, and the only other writer of literary distinction besides Joyce to appear so far- Albert Camus is at least as noteworthy for his thought as for his art. It is as difficult for us to imagine Joyce in such solemn company as it would be to think of him as applying for a fellowship to an Institute for Advanced Thought. Joyce was no thinker, and for all the vast amount of attention that he has received, it is significant that no one has tried to define his "philosophy of life." Like Henry James, he does not seem to have needed one in order to produce great art. Wisely, John Gross does not attempt to supply Joyce with a philosophy in his concise and lucid, introduction to the writer. There are indications that he would like to recruit Joyce to the liberal camp "Ulysses is among the most democratic of modern novels" and "firmly rooted in the modern secular world" but he has to admit that Joyce's irony and his blending of opposites make it difficult to pin him down. We wish that Gross had gone further and stated more emphatically than he does the- way in which Joyce's refusal to take a stand is precisely what makes him a "modern master" as a literary artist. But with this reservation aside, we find Gross's book a most readable and agreeable summation of Joyce's writings. It is marked by wit, balanced judgements, common sense, and such discoveries along the way as this: "Joyce even manages to anticipate the ubiquitous soup cans of Andy Warhol, though he gets the wrong brand: 'Heinz Cans Everywhere."' 838</page><page sequence="133">Hayman, David. ULYSSES: THE MECHANICS OF MEANING. Landmarks in Literature. Prentice-Hall, 1970. 120 pp. $0.00. Here is still another series book. Prentice-Hall's new Landmarks in Litera- ture, under the editorship of Maynard Mack, offer in volumes about the size of their Twentieth Century Views interpretations of undisputed classics from The Odyssey to Ulysses. The need for another introduction to Joyce's novel is questionable at best, but David Hayman has not at- tempted to duplicate readings of Ulysses like Harry Blamires' useful chapter-by-chapter explication in The Bloomsday Book or Stanley Sultan's more ambitious and authoritative Argument of Ulysses. Instead, Hayman uses an approach reminiscent of that which Richard Kain used so effec- tively years ago in Fabu/ous Voyager: he describes the book as a whole by looking separately at some of its varied aspects. To use his own words, "this brief attempt to number the book's qualities" begins by summarizing the backgrounds of the novel, then examines the story-line, the characters, and the setting before taking up the thematic uses of analogy and various facets of technique, structure, and style. We found little that is new in this book, but considering the audience towards which Landmarks in Literature are directed, it does adequately and efficiently what it was meant to do. Ryan, John, ed. A BASH IN THE TUNNEL: JAMES JOYCE BY THE IRISH. London: Clifton Books, 1970. 260 pp. 50/-. The engaging title of this collection comes from Flann O'Brien's essay in the commemorative Joyce issue of Envoy which John Ryan edited in 1951. Now almost twenty years later Ryan adds to the eight articles on Joyce reprinted from that special number another twelve contributions, some of them taken from other sources and a few specially commis- sioned for this volume. As one would expect of a gathering of comments by Irishmen on the writer whom the rest of the world persists in con- sidering that country's greatest, this is a peculiarly uneven and perverse book. After all, it was not until 1969 that the first scholarly book on Joyce was published in Ireland, and most of the contributors who take whacks at Joyce in A Bash in the Tunnel could not have been expected to foresee a time when their bafflement at Joyce's genius and their an- noyance with American scholars would look even more silly and patronizing in print than when expounded in Dublin pubs. There are valuable bits of information about some of Joyce's sources and the originals of his characters among the memoirs and reminiscences in- cluded here, but the book as a whole only substantiates our feeling that the only people less capable of understanding Joyce than the Irish gen- erally are those Irishmen who knew him personally.

Reviewed by GEORGE H. SZANTO, University of California, San Diego In this computer-aided study, Hall and Lind have analyzed Kafka's dreams, as he reported them in his diaries and his letters to Milena thirty-seven dreams in all, over a period of thirteen years, from 1910 to 1923. The authors conclude, as has been thought and oft as well-expressed, that his dreams "are more likely to be continuous with waking life" than they are of serving the function of the "homeostatic process that helps to main- tain one's mental equilibrium" or of the "safety valve by which the accumulated tensions of the day are discharged." Hall and Lind believe in solid, sensible ground rules for use of the computer in humanistic research: "The formulation and specification of appropriate categories for making a content analysis of verbal material is the most crucial feature of the methodology. The most appropriate cate- gories, in our opinion, are those which emerge out of and fairly represent the empirical structure of the verbal material." This methodology, beyond its socio-scientific syntax, cannot be faulted. Their tools allow them to see the underlying relationships between, and explain Kafka's interest in, "the theater, nudism, walking, swimming, travel, reading preferences, and his vocation as a writer. Phenotypic (behavioral) diversity is thereby reduced to genotypic (motivational) unity." The data leading to these con- clusions are worth looking at for the reader interested in hypotheses about Kafka's inner life; for one interested in Kafka's work, they are of value only if continuity can be found between his (dream and waking) life, and his work. But Hall and Lind find difficulty in making that relationship. "Unlike many writers who are obsessed with a specific complex and who write the same novel over and over again," they remark, "Kafka apparently had no specific neurotic fixation that limited his vision." "Kafka's flexibility is most easily seen in his short stories, no two of which deal with the same theme.... That is why the stories can bear the burden of so many different critical interpretations." 841</page><page sequence="136">In 1952 Frederich Beissner wrote: "It is often said that great writers have in fact only one theme, a 'permanent note' running through all the manifold realizations and variations of the theme. Kafka's recurrent theme is the unsuccessful arrival or the failure to reach the goal . . ." Beissner did not have the aid of a computer, did not need to write a program con- taining categories representing the empirical structure of the verbal ma- terial. He had a clear eye, a talent for perception which cut through the mountains of nonsense and non-information about Kafka's works. He scrupulously avoided the different critical interpretations, most of which represent what Heinz Politzer calls "a literary Rorschach test" and tell us more about the critic's fears and neuroses than Kafka's. There is a great deal of room for the analysis by computer of humanistic questions and phenomena. Theoretically, computer analysis should be able to remove much excess pseudo-critical verbiage and elucidate a work's central issues and aesthetic problems. This could be achieved by intelligent programming; but merely recognizing the necessity for letting the works provide categories for the program does not mean the pro- grammer has been able to recognize the categories themselves. Hall and Lind have read, according to their bibliography, much of Kafka's work, as well as selected pieces of Kafka criticism. Some of their categories cer- tainly represent Kafka's themes. None of their categories represents Kafka's single theme, the underlying structure which reduces phenotypic diversity to genotypic unity. Hall and Lind are unquestionably intelligent men; but sensitivity to literary problems and to the relationship of literary problems to social phenomena is in them no more highly developed than it would be in the average garden variety professor of literature who thinks he has yet one more new insight into the dark world of Kafka's days and works. Of'the ideal critical work a reader should be able to say, Yes, the book says it all; like the perfect poem, it alone can express itself. With a good work of criticism the reader can engage in an active and spirited dialogue. But most criticism must be either ignored or, if it can serve an educative function, analyzed for its limitations. Sadly, Hall and Lind's study of Kafka's dreams will produce, aside from an occasional corrective, yet more excess pseudo-critical verbiage based on supposedly objectified computed calculations.

LAWRENCE'S AMERICAN JOURNEY: A STUDY IN LITERATURE AND MYTH. Press of Case Western Reserve University, 1970. 162 pp. $6.95. There have been several good books on Lawrence and America. What distinguishes James Cowan's from its predecessors is his close examina- tion of the small but important corpus of fiction which Lawrence wrote between his arrival at Taos on his thirty-seventh birthday in 1922 until his return to Europe three years later. Cowan finds that this fiction- most significantly "The Princess," "The Woman Who Rode Away," St. Mawr, and The Plumed Serpent- has in common Lawrence's "quest for the symbols and myths whereby what he regarded as the waste land of modern western civilization might be revived." Before considering this body of fiction in detail, Cowan establishes necessary background by discussing in four preliminary chapters 844</page><page sequence="139">Lawrence's cyclic theory of history, the romantic values implicit in his writings on psychology and American literaturet his 8'quarrel with Christianity,'t and the dispute with John Middleton Murry which under- lies four of the short stories which Lawrence wrote in America. Then Cowan finds in the short novels and The Plumed Serpent the basic pattern of the heroic quest as formulated by Jung, Joseph Campbell, and other students of myth-the pattern of separation, initiation, and return which Lawrence himself experienced through his "American journey." This is a carefully researched and thoroughly informed study that is likely to remain the most authoritative work on Lawrencets American fiction. Draper/ R. P., ed. D. H. LAWRENCE: THE CRITICAL HERiTAGE. Barnes and Noble, 1970. 378 pp. $9.5Q. Although only half as long as Robert Deming's two volumes on Joyce in the Critical Heritage Series (see review above), R. P. Draper's selection of critical commentary on Lawrence by his contemporaries is an equally welcome summation. From a 1909 comment on four of Lawrence's early poems to critical obituaries of 1930 Draper has made a selection of what he considers the most representative criticism. Unlike Deming, he has preferred to use whole articles and reviews instead of excerptst and his book lacks as thoroughly analyzed an index as that which distinguishes the Joyce volumes in the series. Nonethelesst it is good to have in one convenient place a selection of contemporary criticism to set beside the mass of personal responses gathered together by Edward Nehis in his three-volume'icomposite biographytt of Lawrence.

Marshallt Tom. THE PSYCh1IC MARINER: A READING OF THE POEMS OF D. H. LAWRENCE. Viking Press, 1970. 276 pp. $12*50. This is an efficient book. Tom Marshall first summarizes previous criticism of Lawrence as poett then takes up more or less chronologically his individual poems, and concludes with a description of general aspects of LawrenceJs poetry and some consideration of his influence on such con- temporaries and followers as William Carlos Wiiliams, the Black Mountain groupt and Ted Hughes. Although Marshall recognizes a pervasive theme of death and resurrection throughout Lawrencets whole career as poet, he sees a steady progression towards mastery in the handling of that theme as Lawrence moved from the personal note of his first poems through the attempt to explore an otherness beyond the ego in Birds, Beasts and Flowers to the final religious vision implicit in such superbly controlled Jater poems as "The Ship of Death." As its sub-title proclaims, The Psychic Mariner is quite literally a reading of Lawrence's poems, a running commentary by a sensitive and observant critic capable of responding intelligently and sympathetically to a body of work never before discussed at such length.

University of Missouri Press, 1970. 90 pp. $2.00. Reviewed by RICHARD J. FEIN, New York State University College, New Paltz On the jacket of the collection of essays edited by Michael London and Robert Boyers is a disfigured drawing of a bust. The head, shoulders and upper chest are rough shapes that jaggedly cohere. There is some kind of lumpy, unwieldly-traditional, and not altogether defined fame here. The face is not really distinguishable, but between the pedestal and the bust itself is the partially shadowed and crowded, blocked-out name of Robert Lowell. The stonework is still unfinished, but it does have a name under it. In time the shape will become clearer, or maybe change altogether. One can never be absolutely certain. Lowell's poetry will determine the shape of that figure. But it should not be too much to say that when literary criticism is effective and pertinent it helps us distinguish the shape above the name. The London 850</page><page sequence="145">and Boyers collection has an amole supply of such criticism. By now there is a pattern that can be detected in some of these studies as the critic notes with twinkling reproof that everyone says Lowell is the best poet around. Our good critic asserts the limitations of such adulation and then goes on to show that as he analyses Lowell the praise turns out to be true but now properly modified by some well placed reservations. (A fellow-critic, I claim to be no exception to this pattern.) It is of the essence in considering such a collection of essays that the reviewer will praise the editors for their reprinting of seminal articles. And this is the case for Frederick Seidel's interview of Lowell, for Marius Bewley's considered strictures of Lord Weary's Castle, for M. L. Rosen- thal's patient and sympathetic discussion of the confessional element in Life Studies, for Hayden Carruth's artful and decent critique of Near the Ocean and Lowell's development since Life Studies, and, naturally, for Nornan Mailer's marvellous adolescent impressions of Lowell once lJpon a Washington protest. Then of course there is the required reprinting of Randall Jarrell's discussion of Lord Weary's Castle. (Everybody agrees that Jarrell's essay is one of the best things ever done on Lowell, and everybody is right.) Most of these essays, along with Jarrell's, show that the best criticism of a poet's work, and that includes expressions of reservations, usually comes from a friendly critic. The best kinds of friends are indispensable for one's self-understanding. There arises the further suspicion that the best of the criticism is related to the critic's feeling that he expects great things from Lowell, whose works possess a skill, an intelligence, and a moral earnestness that we have always looked for in poetry. I think that there is also a secret, and sometimes not so secret, wish in many of these essays for Lowell to escape a despair of self, a despair of contemporary history. Really, the best of the criticism seems to be wishing the poet health. It is a tribute to Lowell that he can call forth this kind of considered criticism of his work. There are of course some exceptions to this pattern. One occurs during the bracing discussions of Lowell as translator-John Simon's attack on Imitations and some of the plays which, while not without its points, is often overdone and sometimes downright bitchy. This leads the reviewer of such an anthology as the one before us to wonder how this or that piece was ever included. And so I feel about Joseph Bennett's brief but embarrassing "review" of Life Studies. (It takes some sort of perverse courage to be so obtuse and wrong-headed, to miss the mark completely.) Then one wonders why the editors included John Simon's recalcitrant review of The Old Glory, or Jeronne Mazzaro's longish and overbearing treatment of For the Union Dead. I wonder why Stephen Spender's intelligent review of Life Studies could not have re- placed Bennett's (unless the editors were beating the bushes for some negative comments), or why W. D. Snodgrass's sympathetic but also critical review of The Old Glory couldn't have been substituted for Simon's insistent piece, or why Thomas Parkinson's treatment of For the lJnion Dead didn't appear instead of Mazzaro's. 851</page><page sequence="146">Then the reviewer is led to the third stage. There are critical pieces I wish had been included regardless of space limitations. (It is the unspoken agreement that the reviewer has such options.) These include the inter- view of Lowell in Delos, which goes a long way toward helping us understand his ideas about translation. Or some of that rich and insight- ful explication of "Skunk Hour" that we get great chunks of in Anthony Ostroff's The Contemporary Poet as Artist and Critic, or Daniel Hoffman's thoughtful survey of Lowell's later work in The Hol/ins Critic. But I also know that every editor is limited in what he can include. And I suspect that Mr. London and Mr. Boyers might be inclined to have similar wistful choices as they open their book from time to time. In any case, interested readers can discover for themselves the amount of material there is about Lowell by consulting the almost exhaustive checklist carefully accumulated by Jerome Mazzaro and appended to the book. It can be used along with the checklist of Lowell's poetry that Hugh Staples appended to his study, Robert Lowell: The First Twenty Years. Finally, the London and Boyers book supplements and sometimes overlaps (necessarily so) Thomas Parkinson's more economically modest collection of essays about Lowell, which appeared in 1968. The student of Lowell should not be lacking for critical material after he has read the poems on his own. R. K. Meiners' monograph is subtitled "An Essay on Robert towell and Modern Poetry." But one gets the impression that neither the main title, the sub-title, nor the work itself helps Meiners concentrate on his real subject, which could be Lowell, or could be Allen Tate, or could be the intellectual condition of modern poetry. For me at any rate the mono- graph just doesn't come off as one piece. Meiners seems caught between adding comments to his previous book about Tate and anticipating some larger work that he will bring out in the future. Lowell gets short shrift in between. I find most useful the sensitive way Meiners puts his finger on what he calls a "tentative tranquility" in the midst of great turmoil in Lowell's poems, and the connections he finds between Tate and Lowell. I would be willing to sacrifice the intellectual posturings of this brief study for one good essay comparing Tate and Lowell, which Meiners should be encouraged to undertake. Even Lowell has wondered aloud just what his connections to Tate are as none of the critics so far has been able to get to it. Though Meiners has greater ambitions in mind for his monograph, it is these "smaller" literary insights that I find most enriching-they, more than the speculative romps, help to bring a rec- ognizable shape to that unfinished bust of the poet.

New York, 1969. 184 pp. $4.50. Reviewed by ROBERT A. KANTRA, Vil/anova University In comparison with James Merritt's Twayne book on Ronald Firbank (see my review above), Alice Bensen's Rose Macaulay has several things in its favor, not the least of which is that it is gracefully written and, within the prescribed scope and format of the Twayne series, informative. Measured against its express aim, to "exhibit" Rose Macaulay's works in a "first published full-length study," it's an agreeable effort. Here too books are summarized, for narrative content in a chronological sequence, rather than generically described; the expository shape of Rose Macaulay's thoughts are sacrificed to the larger but also sketchier continuity, "a related commentary on the lines of thought of the passing decades." But this is a matter of emphasis rather than exclusion; there is a focus, and literary themes emerge: her "Catholic" ritualistic interpretation of Angli- 853</page><page sequence="148">canism; the constancy of humor even through most adversity; the con- nection between her erudition and satiric sense; her intellectual matura- tion, perceptible despite her literary casualness and, sometimes, informality bordering on inattention; overall, the presence of the "implied author." One of Rose Macaulay's chief motifs, a Menippean attitude pinpointed throughout this literary biography, in her own personae, is that "'most of life is a sort of pis-aller,'-a making the best of a poor thing but she views it with 'perpetually amused eyes.' . . . 'Amused' describes the intellectual response of a keen mind in a world that, taken au grand serieux, can but disappoint." The words seem also to describe the domi- nant tone of Rose Macaulay itself, and, perhaps, the implied attitude of its author toward the world of serial biography. CARSON McCULLERS E Hamilton, Alice.

University of California Press, 1970. 270 pp. $7.95. Reviewed by ALEX BENNETT, Queens College of City University of New York Too little does the English-speaking public know of Machado de Assis and of his work. Too little has been written about him and too few of his novels and short stories have been translated. And so we welcome Helen Caldwell's book which admirably fills this gap in our scholarship. With great literary sensitivity she vividly presents a figure that rightfully should be one of the best-known of modern literature. Miss Caldwell's is a scholarly book: the data have been painstakingly researched and copiously documented. When she proffers her opinions, they are always presented in the form of accomplished literary criticism She is well known to readers of Machado de Assis from her excellent translations of his novels and stories and her monograph on Dom Cas- murro, and her present work may well turn out to be the definitive study of the"Brazilian Master." 854</page><page sequence="149">There is, in the opinion of this reviewer, one question left open for further elucidation. Miss Caldwell treats Machado the man and Machado the writer as two separate entities, as she remarks that "Attempts to relate the two, life and works, have served only to obscure the meaning of the works." On the surface, she may be quite right in explaining the absence of the author's physical presence from the literary scene. Her explanation is that Machado may have been motivated by his fear of having his literary image related to his public image. After all, the man R;o de Janeiro knew was a thoroughly courteous and considerate fellow intent on giving offense to nobody, a man with laudable social and political concerns, and a man who appeared as an "incomparable causeur." On the other hand in his works we meet a man who looks at society as a matter of fact, at the whole of mankind-with an ironic viewpoint entirely different from the conciliatory attitude which he must have expressed in his personal contacts with his fellow Cariocas. May we not conclude, therefore, that his stance of irony as writer must have compensated for the equally sincere stance of Machado, the man in the public eye? If this be true, then we would also find an explanation for the difference in tone between his earlier novels and that of his last, Memorial de Ayres. Perhaps, in 1907 when he wrote this novel he felt that, like Ayres-Odysseus, he was near the end of his odyssey. Carolina, his beloved wife, was dead and he had gained national recognition: it had become unnecessary to hold the public figure apart from that of the now-mellowed writer. Machado had "reconciled the past and the future" like Fidelia in the novel: the tone of the novel could be taken as an indication that he had "come home." If, then, the ironic tone of most of his fiction is accepted in this way, the label of pessimism pinned on Machado and vigorously refuted by Miss Caldwell becomes less im- portant. We can be sure that these thoughts must have crossed the author's mind since she as a l;terary critic always tries to be absolutely fair. It may be that she believed such speculations unsuitable for a book which addresses itself to students and scholars. But, in this case, we can hope that her next work on the "Brazilian Master" may be for the general public and that there she may feel free to scrutinize this aspect. We look forward to what she will next have to say on Machado de Assis. ARCHIBALD MacLEISH C McKulik, Benjamin Max. Archibald MacLeish and the French Symbolist Tradi- tion. South Carolina, 1969.

ANDRE MALRAUX: THE HUMAN ADVENTURE. New York University Press, 1969. 336 pp. $8 cloth, $2.45 pb. Reviewed by DAVID G. SPEER, University of South Carolina We must acknowledge our indebtedness to Professor Horvath for bring- ing us this relatively new dimension in Malraux criticism. So much has been said and written about the works of Malraux much of it by Malraux himself that it is difficult to be very original when discussing the main currents of the author's thoughts. Yet, although we may not agree entirely with Dr. Horvath's approach to and interpretation of Malraux's work, we must admit that her view of the cyclic nature of his vision of the world has something to offer. In her introduction, Dr. Horvath reviews the positions of several of the critics who have preceded her. She points out that Picon found the unifying idea of Malraux's literary creation in the quality of man or in the positing of history as the new absolute, that Frohock suggests with- drawal and return of the hero as the unifying element, that Gannon sees Malraux's hope for mankind in the title of his book, "The Honor of Being a Man," that Gerda Blumenthal focuses on the anguish of the contem- porary world, while Blend sees a tragic humanism as the essence of Malraux's vision of life. Professor Horvath's study attempts, as she says, to see Malraux's literary creation which she considers now as being completc from the point of view of an all-embracing subject, "the human adventure," and a unifying idea, the cycle of constant flux. This is another way of saying 856</page><page sequence="151">constant destruction and re-creation, or death and re-birth, which Dr. Horvath views as the key to Malraux's conception of the world. In an effort to present the complete works as an epic of man, and to draw clearly the relationship between the human and the cosmic cycles, Dr. Horvath has used Malraux's books on art as the framework enclosing her discussion of his fictional works. In this she achieves a cyclic presen- tation, except for the final chapter, which is concerned with the Anti- memoires. It is in this approach that the novelty of her study resides. Thus the first part of her book is devoted to the delineation, through the volumes on art, of the spiritual cycle: sacred, divine, profane, sacred, divine, profane, as Malraux traces the history of mankind, through art, from earliest times to the contemporary scene. Within this framework, which serves also as a sort of backdrop for the human element, Dr. Horvath then takes up chronologically the fictional works, each of which serves as the basis for a chapter, from Lunes en papier, illustrating the birth of the "Contemporary Hero," through the "Crisis Facing East and West" (Tentation de l'Occident), the "Sensibility of the Absurd" (Les Conquerants), the "Tragic Intensity of Death" (La Voie royale), "Death as a meaningful Part of Life" (La Condition humaine), the "Rediscovery of Life" (Le Temps du mepris), and the "Infinite Possibilities of Human Destiny" (L'Espoir), to the "Mystical Intimation of the Earthly Paradise" (Les Noyers de l'Altenburg). Some of it has been said before, and Dr. Horvath is quick to point this out. Her talent lies in the fact that she has linked it to the cycle and has thus brought it into a new perspective. She closes with (Part IV) a consideration, through Les Voix du silence, of man's open future, while Part V leads, via the Antimemoires to a consideration of the apparent paradox of the "Permanence and Metamorphosis of a Vision," Malraux's view of the cycle. Although there are the usual typographical errors, and some repetitions, there is much here that is worth considering as it brings new light to bear on Malraux's vision of the destiny of man.

BRIAND, JR., State University of New York, at Oswego All writers, largely considered, are biographers, in that they write about life. Andre Maurois, narrowly considered a biographer, is actuafly a 859</page><page sequence="154">writer in the broader category: he not only wrote about a lifc- different lives, many times; he also wrote about life sketches, essays, histories. In short, Maurois was a widely ranging writer, sometimes achieving great heights of success, often doing pedestrian, time-serving work, but always working with a clear, concise, and memorable style. His reputation will endure primarily as a biographer, because it was as an a-life writer that he scored his greatest triumphs. The two books under consideration, one by Georges Lemaitre, orig- inally published in 1939 and now updated, and the other by L. Clark Keating, both understandably treat Maurois under the broader category because they are studies, not biographies, of the French writer. In a way, this is unfortunate. After reading several books by and about Maurois, one would like a Maurois-like biography of Maurois. The reader yearns for a conversation, say between Emile Herzog (Maurois' real name) and his teacher Emile Chartier, a letter from the writer to either of his wives, or a big scene, event, or episode which marks a turning point in Maurois' life, for example when he decided to become a writer. All would reveal what Maurois always sought in his subjects, a keynote, ". . . cette note unique et vraie" which is discovered not empirically under the facts but intuitively by a "coup d'etat." These books, then, are studies. In his book, L. Clark Keating considers the book by Georges Lemaitre (the 1939 edition) as "the best and most perceptive study of Maurois." In many ways it still is, but Keating in other ways has outdone his predecessor. For example, when M. Lemaitre dis- cusses Maurois' concept of psychological atmosphere, in connection with the novel Climats, he is superb: When we love a person, it means simply that we need the atmosphere surrounding the person. his atmosphere may vary and change; yet through- out it possesses a definite unity, something like the 'climate' of a given country . . . And just as the physical climate of a country may mold the personalities of those who live in it, in the same way the moral atmosphere of a person with whom for a long time we are intimately associated may influence us deeply, even unbeknown to ourselves, to the extent of com- pletely transforming our life. This is keen insight, certainly a keynote or atmosphere of Maurois himself, which, sorry to say, Lemaitre does not pursue as such. Also, in discussing Maurois' Histoire des Etats-Unis, Lemaitre perceptively points out that Maurois had a "three phantom" theory about America, that it was haunted "by the Spirit of Puritanism, by the Ghost of the Pioneer, and by the Specter of the Feudal Lord." In the Sunday book section of a New York newspaper (August 17, 1969) is a reproduction of a pen and ink sketch by Larry Ross; it shows an American wearing a Puritan hat, holding by the hand his little son dressed as a cowboy with hat, gun and holster, and pulling by the other hand his golf cart and bag, with a baseball bat tucked under his right arm. If he were alive, Maurois would chuckle at the rightness of this depiction and wonder if Ross had read his Histoire. For Maurois, these phantoms would be the keys or climats of America, and Lemaitre was right in his understanding. 860 </page><page sequence="155">One of the satisfactions of Keating's book is the way he gives the reader the critical reception of Maurois, telling in brief what the reviewers had to say. Because in his non-biographical non-fiction Maurois was more of a popularizer than an in-depth scholar, the blue-ribbon reviewers took him to task, not understanding that all Maurois wanted to do was to popularize. Also, Keating is very fair in his evaluation of Lemaitre; in discussing what he considers Lemaitre's concern for autobiographical elements in all of Maurois' work (which, I think, is essentially true), Keating says, "Everything that he said and did are, after all, a product of Maurois the man, and if one avoids too doctrinaire an application of his biography, such comparisions can be useful." In the large and narrow sense Maurois was a biographer first and last. Because of his romanticism, he says he was drawn to the great romantics like Shelley and Byron and to a pre-romantic like Chateaubriand. For other inner needs, or demons which he had to exorcise by writing about them, perhaps he was drawn to Disraeli because like himself he met and over- came his Jewishness; in Hugo, his sensuality; and in Balzac, his great appetite for life. In his technique as a biographer, Maurois changed dramatically from the novelistic biographer of Ariel, in which he admits to having "invented" certain conversations, but which nevertheless beautifully evokes the essential "climate" of Shelley, to the scholarly biographer with footnotes, elaborate quotations, and copious bibliogra- phies. The critics got to him for his popular, evocative, and unscholarly life of Shelley, and he changed thereafter, but somehow still managed to find the keynote and seek out the atmosphere of his subject. In many ways, however, Ariel is his best biography because it is a perfect fusion of form and content light, bright, finely and sensitively made, like gossamer. In both of these books, the reader will find the essential and complete Maurois, and both authors pursue their subject in almost the same way, although I like Lemaitre better as he first gives a brief life of Maurois, his early days at Elbeuf in Normandy, his studies at the Lycee Corneille in Rouen, his work in the family woolen factory, his marriage with Janine de Szymkiewicz, his service as an interpreter and liaison officer with the British Army in World War I, and finally his successful first book, Les Silences du Colonel Bramble. From there, in both, we see Maurois and the English, Maurois and America, Maurois the biographer, Maurois the novelist (few of these will endure, except perhaps Climats and Bernard Quesnay), Maurois the non-fictionist, Maurois the philosopher. After having read both books one after the other, Lemaitre followed by Keating, I would have gladly read a third if it had not been a categorizing study, but a biography, one which pursued Emile Herzog until he became Andre Maurois, Andre Maurois until he became a famous biographer, all the while using as a possible touchstone, or keynote, or atmosphere, the irreconcilable fight that raged in the great Frenchman between idealism and reality. Until that time, however, Lemaitre or Keating, or both, will serve admirably. H. L. MENCKEN E Babcock, C. Merton. "The Wizards of Baltimore: Poe and Mencken."

Reviewed by NORMAN A. BRITTIN, Auburn University Jean Gould's biography of Millay furnishes more "Who-did-what-when?" detail about Millay's life than other works have done. Here and there the author has nudged the Millay biography into closer accord with fact. She gives a very detailed, probably accurate account of the Croton party where Edna and Eugen Boissevain fell in love; she has tidied up the record by showing plausibly the date of and the reasons for the com- position of Millay's "To a Sick Friend" and has provided a highly cir- cumstantial recital of the events that caused Millay almost not to gradu- ate with her Vassar class. Miss Gould has particularly filled out (perhaps disproportionately) the history of Millay's associations with Arthur Davison Ficke and Gladys Ficke. Considerable research lies behind the biography. Miss Gould has depended most upon Millay's letters; she also consulted some people who knew the poet. Yet for all the biographer's assiduity The Poet and Her Book is not distinguished. It is exasperating in many respects, and at times one feels embarrassed for the author. Miss Gould tends to write too floridly, and by using romantic cliches she creates a style that, especially in the early part of the book, draws 862</page><page sequence="157">unwelcome attention to itself because she presses too hard. After the first fifty pages the style becomes less purplish though there is some perfunctory writing in the latter half of the book. The presence of two howlers, one hilarious and one simply sorry, makes the reader wonder about the kind of mind that produced the biography: (1) "Pacing hand in hand with sexual passion as yet unrecognized were hidden chambers in which tragedy and the sense of sorrow stalked like ghosts of the past from her readings of Vergil, Shakespeare, Milton . . ." (p. 28); (2) "Edna Millay took stock of her portion of life's bounty and found it fulsome. . . . Here once again was a reaffirmation of life's richness . . ." (p. 283). An annoying number of typographical errors also appears in the text. Even if the author is incorrigibly careless about such things, one would fancy that Dodd, Mead could afford to hire more competent proof-readers and more knowledgeable copy-editors. A few other slips are perhaps more venial. The author is not aware of the relation of "a stalk of fennel" a phrase from "The Poet and H;s Book": "I have stolen breath/ln a stalk of fenne/!" proposed originally as title of Second April to the myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from heaven and brought it to earth in a hollow stalk of fennel (Hesiod, Works and Days, 50-52). She relates it to Mrs. Millay's growing fennel in her herb-garden and not to the divine fire of poetic inspiration. According to Millay's letter to Deems Taylor, the tentative title of their opera was "The Saxons" and not 'JThe Saxon." Miss Gould's account of the second Masses trial makes it seem that the jury acquitted the defendants. Actually the jury disagreed; reportedly their vote was eight to four for acquittal. Sacco and Vanzetti were not convicted on April 15, 1920; on that date the crime against the paymaster and his guard was committed. I doubt that Miss Gould stresses enough the effect of the Sacco- Vanzetti affair on Millay or the radicalism of her political views during most of her life. On this she might well have made use of Grace King's dissertation, which, though she lists it in a bibliography, she does not cite in her text. Her selective bibliography is good though one might quibble over a few omissions. The book has other faults of omission and commission. Miss Gould gives a hazy impression of W. Adolphe Roberts' efforts to publish good poetry in Ainsleets and does not recount how Salomon de la Selva made Roberts aware of Millay. She does not mention Pieter Mijer, the one of Millay's "suitors" of whom Roberts was most jealous, nor suggest that Mertont the stockbroker of Conversation at Midnight resembles stock- broker George LaBranche, Millay's wealthy Austerlitz neighbor. She in- dulges in comparisons of Millay and Emily Dickinson that are quite un- convincing, uses too many amateurish hints about the future significance of happenings, and brings up occasional fortuitous linkings that are merely bothersome, sush as Edmund Wilson's "she burned like a little furnace" and Millay's line "Love like a burning city in the breast." She writes with too constant adulation. She does not stress how strongly Millay sub- scribed to nearly all the articles of the Greenwich Village creed, and thus tends to show the poet as more of a nicey-pants than I believe she was. Miss Gould also makes various assertions about influences on Millay's personality and feelings (cf. pp. 7, 31, 93, 140-41) as though they were 863 </page><page sequence="158">certainties and not speculations. The prudent reader should remember that "maybe" is all one can say to such surmises. The biography is much more about "the poet" than about "her book." Still it includes a good many comments on Millay's poems and books though an assessment of her total achievement is wanting. Miss Gould gives special praise to Fatal Interview and to "Epitaph for the Race of Man." She calls Arfa da Capo "an arresting allegory denouncing war," an inadequate description, as Harold Lewis Cook, John Patton, and I have each explained. A person uninformed about Millay can find much that is informative in this biography. A scholar will encounter very little that is worth his while. ARTHUR MILLER A Nelson, Benjamin. ARTHUR MILLER: PORTRAIT OF A PLAYWRIGHT. David MacKay Company, 1970. 336 pp. $5.95. Reviewed by HELEN McMAHON, Purdaxe University This newest book on Arthur Miller presents itself as a portrait of Arthur Miller's development into "one of the most powerful and important dramatists in the contemporary theatre." M;ller is called a rebellious playwright whose themes "represent his revolt against a theatre singing dirges of woe." The book is in part a defense of these statements. Like other entrants to the field of Miller criticism, Nelson feels obliged to spar with his predecessors, particularly with Miller's detractors. His defenses against the familiar criticisms (that Miller is purely a social or psychological and didactic dramatist) and most of the biographical ma- terial, even though they lend substance to the growth of a useful theme, give the reader a feeling of deja vu. But the better and more novel aspect of Nelson's more objective study is his tracing through consecutive works, plays and novels alike, Miller's themes as they expand in depth and relevance. The discovery of a continuing thread in Miller's works is not original with Nelson, but his analyses go beyond the often statistical repetition of the hackneyed frustration of Miller's early heroes of limited intelligence. The chapter titles, almost all of which are quotations from the various works, suggest some of the elements in the working out of affirmation. What begins as a somewhat mechanical questioning of fate or luck in the early play The Man Who Had All the Luck develops into a complexitv of the wonders and fears of the contemporary common man in Death of a Salesman. A study of the last three plays, After the Fal/, Incident at Vichey, and The Price expands the theme still further and it becomes crystalized in E. M. Forster's phrase "Only Connect," the title of Nelson's final chapter. Miller's rebellion against the theatre of despair and mean- inglessness is defined in the affirmation his characters are groping for, in the attempted reaffirmation of dignity and in the possibility of action. The charges of pessimism and didacticism and Millerts failure to fuse idea and story die hard; but Nelson works to lessen the virulence of 864 </page><page sequence="159">these accusations with qualifications of his own and by exploiting the human drama which is achieved. Nelson shows that the individual or the family is the microcosm in which the various conflicts are displayed. The search for relatedness is rendered primarily through fathers and sons, but Miller, we learn, plays variations on other relationships within the family. This central figure or group, circumscribed by its particular illusions or delusions, is plunged into conflict with the external, strange, and changing world. The continual question is, "What out there is accountable? What inside man is ac- countable"? Sometimes answers are provided on the topical level because they are demanded by a particular form and structure; but in the under- lying, secret drama the question remains. Guilt is found to be on both sides. Nelson makes the point that in working out the relationships both technically and thematically Miller "berates society," and also "scores the man who is a threat to the society." The major problem with Miller and perhaps the key to the meaning Nelson uncovers is in the difficulty of combining the "credible and incredible," the actual and the fantasy. Miller's difficulty is in finding neutral enough territory on which the two can be fused. He attempts to do this through the open form of Death of a Salesman and After the Fall, thrsough the device of a double perspective in A View from the Bridge, and by the use of the outsider father-figure in The Price. In exploring the links among the works as they relate to and contrast with each other, Nelson describes the layers of the deepening conflict in numerous ways: between father and son, past and present, victim and victimizer, individual and society, illusion and reality, guilt and atone- ment, blame and responsibility, anguish and hope, determinism and free will, condemned or redeemed, belief and disbelief. The historical or geographical location of the dramas and the topical subject matter may vary, but the dichotomies of the conflict within the hero and between him and his world provide the deepening core which links all the works. Nelson searches for the genuine as well as the false. He sees, for instance, Willy Loman's error as one of misjudgment: not, as other critics have reiterated, necessarily in false dreams; but in confusing "the human being with the salesman," the man with the job, and in trying to buy love as if it were for sale. In the early plays, the characters are revealed as guilty. As the theme expands, even this guilt is seen as an illusion. The direction is towards transcendence and affirmation, instead of atonement. The growth or change is summed up in the last two plays with Von Berg in Incident at Vichey accepting responsibility "before the fact" and with Solomon in The Price "facing life without illusions." In whatever form or with whatever words, Miller is concerned with "the fundamental worth of the individual in his continued struggle for reassertion against the forces that erode and undermine him." But at the same time the words Nelson uses for John Proctor in The Crucible are true for the others: "to a degree he is a victim of a choice he has already made." In summing up, each character begins by seeing his world and his connections with it as "ending at the building line"; but in crises he discovers that without conscious intention he is involved. 865</page><page sequence="160">These interpretations of Miller's works necessitate an objectivity and a willingness to look beyond the topical or biographical and to uncover the writer's directed intentions, whether or not he is always successful, and a recognition of the "secret drama" which sometimes lies unspoken behind the realistic, banal dialogue. Nelson has done this. Whatever repetition there may be of what has already been said about Arthur Miller and whatever limitations there may be in this method, this is a useful study. It brings together all the plays and the novels into a con- tinuous thread of Miller's artistic development. B Weales, Gerald, ed. THE DEATH OF A SALESMAN.

FORM AND IMAGE IN THE FICTION OF HENRY MILLER. Wayne State Univ'ersity Press, 1970. 229 pp. $8.50. Reviewed by JAY BOCHNER, University of Montreal Jane A. Nelson's book on the form of Henry Miller's novels marks an important turning point in Miller criticism, for hitherto form is the one thing Miller's supporters have failed to claim for him. Even William A. Gordon's two volumes, with the important contributions of Miller him- self in the second, failed to deal with the novels themselves as works of art, as intellectually respectable as they may have begun to make the writer. Professor Nelson tells us what images make the structure, or at least one possible structure, which has eluded us. Suddenly formalists, of whatever ilk, must make a little room for the "gob of spit in the face of art." Miller may be entering through the back door, for the analysis will certainly prove too Jungian- that is to say, too fanciful for many; but he needn't come in the front door to be inside. If I thought Professor Nelson were making a less remarkable con- tribution I would consider the drawbacks of her book too serious for me to recommend it, and I would save the damning for last. My greatest objection is to an appalling lack of context. We plunge immediately into 866</page><page sequence="161">a vast landscape of Miller's fictional fauna and flora in the almost exclu- sive light of Jung and one Erich Neumann, who are quoted far more extensively than Miller himself, with bits of Angus Fletcher's Allegory: The Theory of a Symbolic Mode and Northrop Frye's Anatomy of Criticism to provide somewhat more literary bolstering. We emerge some two hundred pages later soaked to the bone in archetypal activity, but having seen only the barest mention of any other literary figure, and absolutely no reference at all to anything Miller ever read. Miller's rejection of art and culture makes exception for a host of writers and thinkers, for he stands in a solid if apparently marginal tradition. What of Andre Breton, Celine, Blaise Cendrars, Nerval, Knut Hamsun, Hesse, Nietzsche, Nostradamus, Rimbaud, Spengler, Whitman, a few names I take from Miller's own list of major influences (see appendix to The Books in My Life), all of whom are relevant to a Jungian approach to Miller? It seems to me important to give some idea of Miller's conscious relation to the first framework to be found for his work. Professor Nelson does not seem to care if Miller ever read Jung. If he had not, her thesis would be no weaker; but if he had (which is interesting in itself! I should think) the case would only be more solid, as the discovery of fine form always goes to the author's credit, intentional fallacy notwith- standing. Now, with very little trouble I find the following from Miller to Anais Nin, dated February, 1934 (while Miller was cutting Cancer down to its final shape and also working feverishly on a long study of D. H. Lawrence which never appeared): "I've discovered in myself what i've been shouting about in the theory of annihilation, via Nietzsche, Jung, Father Orpheus, Mother Incest, etc. etc." Here, and in the rest of this letter, we find all the clues we need to start us off after the "Terrible Mother" archetype which is the subject of Professor Nelson's first three chapters. Furthermore, Jung's essay, "Modern Man in Search of a Soul," on the liberation from archetypal unconsciousness, is quoted at length in another letter to Anals Nin in December of 1934 lCancer was published in September), and again at even greater length in a letter to Michael Fraenkel on December 16, 1935 (in Hamlet). Jung's '8search" is that of the hero of Miller's fiction as Professor Nelson sees him. If the evidence for a Jungian analysis is to be found in Miller's own writing, why not start there? Or what of Cendrars' novel Moravagine, much admired by Miller and referred to in Cancer? Professor Neison's technique would find even richer soil in Cendrars' demented destroyer, as the obvious title indicates (Doubleday's recent translation is called MoraVagine). This specifically literary poverty points to another problem. There is so much quoting of Jung and Neumann that sometimes even Miller seems forgotten. The best section is Part I, the first three chapters, where numerous examples from Miller corroborate Professor Nelson's use of Jung at every point. In Part 11 (mainly chapters 4 and 5) Miller slips from our grasp. The reading is difficult, but even if we survive all the quoting on the "transpersonal unconscious" and related concepts we see only vaguely the same developments in Miller's work. The revealing images become more rare and Millerts structure begins to waver. The analysis repeats itself a bit, including finally too much protesting against other critics' demands for mimesis in Miller; the point is well-enough made, 867 </page><page sequence="162">with the help of Professor Frye on Romance. It is mostly in the last ten pages or so of the book that many of the pieces are put together to confirm one's impression at the outset that the analysis is sound in principle and general outline, even if it wanders a good deal among the details. There is no doubt in my mind that the archetypal images Professor Nelson discusses do indeed make order, cogent sense, of Miller's "frag- ments" (Widmer), and that at two levels; in each novel and in the series of "confessions" as a whole. The best analysis remains that of Tropic of Cancer. It is the volume to which Professor Nelson returns most often, and the one which illustrates her best chapters, the opening three on the Terrible Mother and the rebellion of the self against her power. The images of anima (the Mona/Mara throughout Miller's work) and shadow abound in this decidedly allegorical book, as well as the search for a central self. The movement of the "narrative" becomes even quite grace- ful in the light of this analysis, with the freezing hell of Dijon and the symbolic liberation in Paris at the end. The implications of the analysis are numerous and should offer new directions for a serious study of Miller and his importance, which I think we ought to recognize is greater than has been explained by a kind of grudging critical appreciation. For example, Professor Nelson's view of the Tropics, carried into the domain of Kate Millett's political explanation of Miller's aggressive sexuality, suggests a surprising possibility. Miller is not subjugating women who are potentially his equals, but rather ex- ploding the possessive maternal womb, the All-American Mother who really runs the American Show. Professor Nelson quotes innumerable "sexual" passages where it is quite clear the hero is in thrall, or savagely fighting thralidom. And in Sunday After the War Miller wrote: With the concomitant emancipation of woman, entailed by this great change, the awakening of the love instinct will transform every domain of life. [....] Our art has been masculine through and through, that is to say, lop-sided. It has been vitiated by the unacknowledged feminine principle. This is as true of ancient as of modern art. The tyrannical, subterranean power of the female must come to an end. Men have paid a heavy tribute for their seeming subjugation of the female. (in Nelson, p. 117, quoted for other reasons). Suddenly Miss Millett is cast in the sorry role of civilizing American mother who won't let her son go, especially not to another woman unlike herself. I don't, in fact, hold that opinion about Miss Millett's intentions, but I certainly wonder about Sexual Po/itics making it to the Book-of-the-Month Club! With the present analysis the Tropics should take their rightful place in the tradition of Rimbaud's "Drunken Boat" and "A Season in Hell." They should not need excuses, particularly not for their obscenity (I think this was the gist of the defense in court; obscenity was acceptable because it contributed to other meanings); on the contrary, the obscenitv is the whole point. When Tropic of Cancer finally appeared in The United States Stanley Kauffman wrote for The New Republic that Miller gave away his "residual puritanism" by not calling Mona a cunt, as he did every other woman in the book. Professor Nelson makes perfectly clear 868</page><page sequence="163">why Miller treated her as he did. The Mona/Mara figure slowly emerges as the anima which may permit some escape from all the other images of archetypal Gorgons. For them, obscenity is accurate, and a liberating incantation. A great disorder begins to make sense. If such a structure offends some critics, at least we may say now that it is their blindness and not Henry Miller's. Wood, Richard Clement, ed. COLLECTOR'S QUEST: THE CORRESPONDENCE OF HENRY MILLER AND J. RIVES CHILDS, 1947-1965. University Press of Virginia (for Randolph-Macon College), 1968. 216 pp. $5.75. Reviewed by PAUL R. JACKSON One of the persistent themes in Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, that late expatriate's novel of outraged Parisian living, is the artist's ambigu- ous but essential need for loneliness. In one digression, Miller quotes at length from Giovanni Papini's The Failure. "People pester me and they pester others with inquiries about what I am doing," the successful Papini cries. "I am a free man and I need my freedom. I need to be alone." In a first novel by an artistic unknown, the excursus on the debilitating effect of fame is an attractive act of literary braggadoccio. But it was also prophetic. Miller's notoriety and final success have brought him the publicity of which Papini complained. The past twenty years have shown an increasing stream of interviewers and curiosity seekers all the public nuisance that follows best-selling novels. Still, fame has its rewards, and in Miller's case this has meant a demand for the publication of letters, sometimes as publicity for friends, but generally with the added solidification of Miller's literary reputation. The newest volume of letters is Collector's Quest: The Correspondence of Henry Miller and J. Rives Childs, 1947-1965. Always insisting on the autobiographical voice, Miller saw the value of the epistolary form back in the thirties. The chatty philosophical musings of Ham/et were cast in the form of a debate via letters with Michael Fraenkel, and the later Semblance of a Devoted Past is essentially a selection of Miller's correspondence with an American painter friend. Art and Outrage, published in 1959, shifted the justification for publish- ing correspondence from artistic form to literary publicity. In this col- lection of public letters about Miller written expressly for publication by Lawrence Durrell and Alfred Perles, the establishment of Miller's artistic reputation was a basic motive. In recent years several volumes of more legitimately personal letters have appeared. We have Miller's correspond- ence with Durrell, his letters to Anais Nin, and his epistolary debates with William Gordon. While the publication of all these later collections has been bound up with questions of literary promotion, they have all been valuable in coming to terms with an author who has generally received less critical attention than is his due. And for a writer using autobiographi- cal fact as intimately as Miller has, letters become a direct and honest extension of the romanticized life of the fiction. 869</page><page sequence="164">LOUIS MacNEICE The letters to and from Childs have less critical interest than any of the above. Childs, once American ambassador to Saud; Arabia and Ethiopia, has authored books on Restif de la Bretonne and Casanova. He is a man of letters in the now old-fashioned sense of the statesman avocationally turned scholar and writer; in one letter he can still speak of "lofty sentiments." An early reader of Miller, he wrote first in 1947, enclosing a defense of the American writer he had sent to a disparaging French critic. Miller, delighted to have a champson, replied, and the two began the correspondence of this voJume. An avid collector of Milleriana, Childs has deposited his collection at Randolph-Macon College, and part of the reason for this book is publicity for those holdings and for the new college press. Unlike other volumes of Miller letters, this one does not involve cor- respondence with either a close artistic friend or an academic critic. Until 1953 the letters are formally addressed-"Dear Mr. Childs." There- after uneasy substitutes occur - "Dear Henry Miller" or "Dear Rives Childs," the awkward "Dear friend" being the nearest approach to intimacy. As a result, no souls are bared and no serious discussion of Miller's writing takes place. Childs, always afraid he may be intruding like Papini's autograph hunters, seems to have introduced Miller to Restif, but for the most part he is content to praise and to defend Miller against charges of sexual anarchy. Little real substance enters the ex- changes. Miller himself is delighted to have a correspondent in such magical places as Jidda and Addis Ababa, an exoticism appropriate to a writer who has consistently associated the Orient with utopian longings unsatis- fied by Europe and America. And Miller is ecstatic over the discovery of Restif: '@1 see that I shall end by reading every thing of Restif's I can lay hands on. How right you were to keep after me in this connection!" Occasionally, attitudes are revealed that are helpful in understanding his art. There ist for examplet Miller's defense of the elder writer. The work of most great artists, he says, "becomes more simplified and more daring that is to say, more absolutely in accord with their real, inner nature, until finally it is a veritable blaze of lightt the soul aflame, so to speak." Neither Wordsworth nor Whitman is identifiable here, but the passage does underscore Miller's later religious focus, that softening cosmic concern that replaced the radical engagement with life one finds in the earlier books. Certain facts, too, become suggestive. Thus we learn that Nexus was planned as a "long, longt volume,t' "the hardest to do," and that Miller as late as 1961 was hoping to get back to the second volume. The suggestion is clear that Nexus as we have it is incomplete and The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy truncated. But such gleanings are not abundantr and perhaps the most valuable part of the book is the appendix listing Miller items at Randolph-Macon College. While unpublished material in no way rivals that collected at UCLA, there are typescripts and copies of typescripts of a few minor pieces like '@Mara-Marignan't and some of the essays. There is also a large collection of books and pamphlets, many first editions, and several hard-to-get items like Maurizius Forever and The Waters Reglitterized. Collectoros Quest is not a crucial addition to Miller criticism. Still, let- 870</page><page sequence="165">ters have a way of rounding out one's view of their author, and here and there Miller reveals himself sufficiently to give the reader further glimpses of a writer who, more than most, has blurred the distinction between private letters and fictionalized autobiography. Miller has always insisted that there is no difference between the man and the fictionalized hero. Letters are one means of testing that assertion. E Jackson, PalJl R.

Moore. Crosscurrents I Modern Critiq;es. Southern Illinois Uni- versity Press, 1 970.138 pp. $4.95. Reviewed by ROBERT B. lOHNSONo University of Massachusetts Lucille Becker's series of brief essays on the life and work of Henry de Montherlant, published as a "critical biography" for Southern Illinois' Crosscurrents/Modern Critiques collectiont is designed as an introduction to Montherlant for the general English-speaking reader. Space limitation, possibly imposed by editorial policy, prevents the proper fulfillment of the flyleaf's rather loud claim that hers is the "first study in English to deal comprehensively with all of Henry de Montherlant's work and to discuss the style of this master of French prose." Many important works, especially the poetry and the major novels-the tetralogy of Les Jeunes Filles, for example receive far too cursory a discussion, and lesser works, im- portant from a critical standpoint, are barely mentioned in passing. Furthermore, readers will find in John Cruickshank's Montherlant (London: Oliver and Boyd, 1964) an earlier analysis in English of the Montherlantian style. 871</page><page sequence="166">Following in the steps of other critics, Mrs. Becker chooses to emphasize the "doctrines" set forth in the essays "Syncretisme et alternance" and "Service inutile," in order to explicate the nature of Montherlant's heroes. While her points of departure are justifiable to a certain degree, they are by no means satisfactory or complete; I think, too, that Mrs. Becker may have overlooked the multiple possibilities of Montherlant's "universal man." What bothers me most, however, is her conviction, shared with some current writers of criticism, that Montherlant has devoted his entire career to talking about himself. If his early writings are indeed autobiographical, his later (and more important) literary works treat man, or the human condition, in the midst of moral and social chaos, one that will end in "le neant" of death. Certainly, his tragic heroes of the dramas are not all derived from an Alban Bricoulism of the Iyric Les Bestiaires, although a Malatesta or a Cisneros possesses portions of the mass contradictions Montherlant outlined in the several key essays. Readers may not readily understand, then, Mrs. Becker's concluding remark that Montherlant "has allowed his heroes to contradict them- selves and to show themselves to be enslaved by their passions, unable to suit their lives to their illusions." Always contradictory, these heroes are perhaps less than enslaved: Are not renunciation, indifference, and suicide (taking several forms) means to avoid moral slavery? Worse, to continue my earlier comment, is the possibility that Montherlant portrays himself in his heroes of the later works, for he had already abandoned self-depiction in his novel Les Celibataires. In her serious effort to treat more than fifty works in 115 pages of text, Lucille Becker has had to allow herself far too little space for genuinely comprehensive analyses. Little more than four pages, for example, are devoted to the four long novels of Les Jeunes Filles. It is clearly evident that her interest lies primarily with the theater, whose discussion is clearer, although still somewhat thin. What strikes me as unfortunate is the absence of Lucille Becker's own views on the French writer, whether out of modesty or in t-he interests of academic direction. Most of her criticism reflects Montherlant's pronouncements (not always apropos, incidentally, and frequently at odds with his textual evidence), or else those of his French critics, some of whom, perpetuating the hopelessly uninformed or prejudiced early analyses, should undoubtedly be dropped from future bibliographies. Now that several critical works in English have appeared, albeit with different emphases, it is time to eliminate from critical appraisal that portion of Montherlantiana of merely passing interest. Lucille Becker's selected bibliography is not entirely complete up to 1969 and contains some unfortunate entries of dubious value. Also, the lumping together of autobiographical works of fiction and novels is awkward and disconcerting: Are Les Celibataires, Les Jeunes Filles, and Le Chaos et la nuit autobiographical? I find no real evidence that they are. To the uninformed reader Montherlant then becomes an impoverished nobleman who commits suicide, a ludicrous and sadistic writer struggling more with his own salvation than with the imposition of three rare women, and a somewhat unconvincing Spanish anarchist. English-speaking readers may also be put off by the exclusive listing of British translations, 872</page><page sequence="167">save for the last entry, since all of these works have appeared in U.S. editions. While offering no new or original interpretations of Montherlant's work, Mrs. Becker nevertheless gives a point of view in summary form. Happily, here is a dispassionate effort, counterbalancing the views of far too many French critics whose conclusions are passionate and of doubt- ful merit. E Belli, Angela.

Northern Illinois University Press, 1970. 274 pp. $15. Reviewed by FLORIAN J. SHASKY, University of San Francisco This bibliography, which is based on Mr. Gilcher's personal collection, is the most complete and accurate record of Moore's writings to appear in print. The book contains much new material on the complicated printing and publishing history relating to Moore's literary accomplish- ments. There are five sections in the bibliography: Books and Pamphlets, Contributions, Periodical Appearances, Translations and Miscellanea. A brief summary of previous Moore bibliographies is included in the Preface. Titles are arranged in chronological order and are assigned capital letters and numerals in the style of the Soho bibliographies. De- tailed collations and notes provide reliable and comprehensive documen- tation for first editions and revised editions. The first and longest section, Books and Pamphlets, "contains descrip- tions of all titles associated with Moore, including early works excluded by him from the canon of the Carra and Uniform editions, his translation of Daphnis and Chloe, the Anthology of Pure Poetry, which he edited, several volumes of letters, and occasional printings and pamphlets." Although Gilcher has described Moore's primary editions, a few variants have been omitted. For example, the normal binding for Remi- niscences of Impressionist Painters is "heavy gray overlapping wrappers," but the booklet was also issued in plum-colored wrappers. The second volume of the trilogy, 'Hail and Farewell!', Salve, is usually bound in blue cloth, though a few copies were cased in red cloth for distribution to the circulating libraries. The second section of the bibliography, Contributions, contains all but the very fragmentary excerpts from books and auction catalogues. One curious omission is the lack of any reference to the pale green binding of the first American edition of Poor Folk for which Moore wrote a Preface in praise of Dostoevsky. This edition is ordinarily found with a rust-colored cloth binding. 873</page><page sequence="168">The list of periodical appearances in section three is impressive. Mr. Gilcher has identified many early unsigned articles by Moore but a few contributions for later years have been missed. For example, only two articles are recorded for the year 1924. Two more may be added: "Quotes from the World Today" with commentary was 3rinted in the Advertiser's Weekly on February 8, and an interview "Mr. George Moore on the Vulgarity of London" appeared in the February 1st issue of the Manchester Guardian Weekly. The chapter on translations covers thirteen foreign Zanguages and includes each title with brief bibliographical information. In the last part of the book, Miscellanea, Gilcher reviews the evidence that pertains to sixteen titles which were either never completed or never written by Moore. Due to the compiler's careful research there should be much less speculation among bookmen on the existence of Moore's alleged first productiont Wor/dliness, or whether he ever published a book called In Minor Keys. Notwithstanding the minor omissions of binding variants, a few mis- prints, and the awkward arrangement of footnotes, this book is so far the definitive bibliography of George Moore's writings. Owens, Graham, ed. GEORGE MOORE'S MIND AND ART. Barnes and Noble, 1970. 182 pp. $6.50. Reviewed by MEREDITH CARY, Western Washington State College Graham Owens ljseful addition to the Barnes and Noble series, Essays Old and New, serves as a microcosm of George Moore schoZarship. AlX the familiar responses are here, from half-grudging respect for the stylistic innovator to belittling reference to the slave of French models. Reference to the writer who made a permanent impact on the form of the novel is interlarded with rehashings of bad jokes about the "melodic line." Such a balance of appreciation and denigration was perhaps not hard to achieve in view of the undeniable artistic merit of the work and the wealth of ironical anecdote about the man. But a balance of critical response was clearly less available: the editor found it necessary to com- mission five of the nine essays in order to do justice to the scope of Moore's writings. Some gaps in criticism may not be surprising in view of the breadth of Moorets involvement in intellectual and literary issues. A study of the entire Moore canon calls for an interest in a theory of biography and autobiography, in a theory of fictional techniques including the develop- ment of both the novel and the short story, in the literary uses of religion, myth and folk materials, history, psychology, and musical theory, in the importation of French modes especially naturalism and symbolism into England. A history of publishing must concern itself with Moore's cam- paign against British censorship both of French imports and of native English frankness. Moore's patronage of the French Impressionists sug- gests his importance to art history. 874</page><page sequence="169">Such a multiplicity of interests perhaps invites fragmented critical treatment: studies of Moore normally concern themselves with only one of his self-publicized "phases.t' And as this collection indicates, the bulk of previously existing scholarship concerns itself with the English "off- shoot" of Zola who wrote derivative poetry and derivative novels, or with the disaffected Irishman who satirized his native land. The most injurious result of such partiality of coverage is that, whatever witticisms may persist as to Moore's having conducted his education in public, the fact remains that he did educate himself. Studied as examples of a devel- oping rather than randomly varied technique, Moore's works constitute almost a laboratory demonstration of literary methodology. Not only did he maintain a running commentary on the changes in his procedures during fifty years of literary experimentation, but he compulsively revised earlier works to bring them into ,shase with his later formal theories. Thus a focus on the early transmitter of French effects obscures the artistic contribution of the mature writer. Graham Hough observes in his summarizing essay that a revaluation of Moore is overdue. And Graham Owens' intelligent introduction outlines areas where research is needed. Appropriatelyt it is the variety of Moore's accomplishment which is suggested by the new material in this critical collection. Herbert Howarth discusses Moore's innovative use of regional- ism in his I rish fiction and his use of moral intention to organize his autobiographical writing. Brendan Kennelly indicates the importance of Moore's use of the short story as only one of a group of thematically interdependent elements culminating in a unified whole. And Graham Owens' excellent analysis of the melodic line demonstrates that Moore's final novelistic form constituted an alternative to the more widely publicized stream-of-consciousness form in its amalgamation of "objec- tive" narrative, dialogue, reverie, reading, observation and recollection into a unified symmetrical narrative strand. The technique might serve as a useful image for a new approach to Moore. It is cripplingly simplistic to confront the problems created by the diversity of his interests by regarding his work as an unimaginative pastiche of borrowings or as a badly indexed reflection of a scattering of intellectual backgrounds. Instead, his writings can more usefully be examined as the varied output of a single mind. Pointing toward such a critical stance, this highly responsible collection of essays addresses itself to the entire Moore canon. C Armato, Philip M.

Twayne's English Authors Series, No. 72. New York, 1969. 182 pp $4.50. Reviewed by MARVIN MAGALANER, City College of City University of New York The recent trend toward rehabilitating the reputation of John Middleton Murry as a critic is evidenced by Ernest G. Griffin's study. It follows by several years the authorized biography of Murry by F. A. Lea, the re- issuing of Murry's The Problem of Style, and the appearance of at least one anthology devoted exclusively to Murry's criticism. The process of re-evaluation is distinctly belated, following as it does a quarter-century of benign neglect. During that period, Murry was known ---if he was known at all as the husband of the late Katherine Mansfield who had rnade a good thing of advertising their relationship in his editions of her letters, journal, and scrapbook; or as the acquaintance of D. H. Lawrence who seemed obsessed with defining that acquaintance with the persistence of the Ancient Mariner. Now, however, and since his death over a decade ago, Murry is to be taken seriously again-as he was by the literate community from the Teens of this century until, perhaps, the onset of the Second World War This renewed interest is certainly appropriate and predictable, for the kind of broad, universal criticism that Murry developed, his concern for 877</page><page sequence="172">the human being behind the work of art and the relationship of that human being to his environment, is once again assuming marked im- portance in the intellectual climate of post-New Criticism. Griffin restricts himself to Murry's contributions to English literature, particularly to his literary criticism. The result is an admirable sur- vey of Murry's positions and accomplishments organized to fit a short 150 pages. To Mu rry's treatment of Shakespeare, Keats, and Lawrence he devotes most of his attention. This approach is logical inasmuch as Murry's extended career was so deeply involved with these artists, but even more so, his criticism of them as writers was so closely personal and idiosyncratic so autobiographically revealing-that an analysis of his views tells the reader much about John Middleton Murry the man as well. The problem is that Murry wrote so much, in so many diverse areas (mysticism, theology of a sort, politics, sociology, literary criticism, and so on) that Griffin is forced to slight a great deal in order to keep his own study within bounds. This limitation forces him, at times, into a college outline type of format that understandably must skirt the surface. This is a pity because, given free range, the author could offer a thorough and illuminating view of Murry's mind unavailable in criticism up to this time. ROBERT MUSIL C Wilson, David Jack.

FRANK NORRIS: INSTINCT AND ART. University of Nebraska Presst 1969.180 pp. $5.95. Reviewed by RICHARD ALLAN DAVISONt University of Delaware For me it was impossible to read William B. Dillingham's study, Frank Norris: Instinct and Art without recollecting his earlier (1961 ) un- published dissertation, Themes and Literary Techniqales in the Fiction of Frank Norris. And a comparison of the two efforts is in the main not invidious. A most significant contribution occurs in his early discussion of Norrist apprenticeship as a painter, which demonstrates additionai research since Dillingham's doctoral probings. Throughout the rest of the study, where he frequently has kept the insights and wording of his dis- sertationt he generally has used the scissors and paste pot to good effect and has reorganized arXld updated his material admirably. His discussion of Norris' symbolismt for instance, is handled more perceptively in a broader frame of reference. Unfortunately, too much of what Diliingham has to say has been said before in longer books and briefer statements. Such reiteration exacer- bates the proliferation of the day There is not much new in the five chapters under the two headings of 'Themest' and @8Form and Stylett which take up three fxfths of the book. What he has saidt however, is usually stated with a certain freshness and precision. The first two chap- ters add newness of content to stylistic felicit:y. Under the heading, "Life and Career," Mr. Dillingham offers his con- tribution to recent Norris scholarship. He retells the biography of Norris' youth with new emphasis on Norris as painter turned literary artist. The specific information about Norris' art studies in Paris and the particular schools of painting that obviously influenced Norris takes us beyond the material on his painting apprenticeship found in the fine seminal works of Franklin Walker and Ernest Marchand. It is well known that Norris studied at the famous Academie Julian. Dillingham explores the lesser known theory of art and practice of its renowned teacher/ Adolphe William Bouguereau, as well as the views of such influential painters as Gustave Boulanger, Tony Robert-Fleury and Jules LeFebvre. The philosophy of hard work and first rate technical craftsmanship Norris learned from Bouguereau helps in an understanding of Norris' Vandoverr who loses his talent largely through profligacy and idleness What Norris demanded of himself as a novelist when writing The Octopus-close observation and careful research- he earlier praised in the California artist, Charles 87g</page><page sequence="174">Rollo Peters, after the fashion of Bouguereau's criticism. LeFebvre's de- mand for accuracy in drawing is later echoed in Norris' literary criticism. But by the writing of The Octopus Norris was demanding more than mere accuracy. Dillingham astutely points to the essential subjectivism in Norrist writings that was not straitjacketed by the strictures of the academicians at the Julian: "Academic art was firmly anchored in an intellectual tradi- tion which distrusted subjectivism and glorified competence and clarity, which distained inspiration and preached hard work." Another important observation suggests a likely influence on Norris' literary use of color. Dillingham recalls the "deathlike greys" of Gerome and Bouguereau and sees a relative lack of bright color in Norris (which, according to Norris' painting teachers, "tended to destroy perspective and detracted from draughtsmanship and composition") as compared to the writing of Stephen Crane, a student of the Impressionistic school of painting. Except for the gold imagery in McTeague and scenes of blood and fire in stories like "Grettir at Drangey" Norris' writings do lack the visual impressionistic color of Crane's. Norris' talent was as different from Crane's as were their backgrounds. Yet many critics still place them side by side in that pigeonhole called naturalism. Dillingham's book does contain some statements that need further qualification. The parallel between Thurber's "Woman-Ape Man cartoon" and Norris' so-called "constant dread that he might be [an] effeminate little man" is overdrawn. Certain generalizations need to be qualified, such as the claim that "In only one place [the Gerard dinner party scene Norris juxtaposes to the scene of Mrs. Hooven's starvation] is there possi- ble evidence of Norris' dislike of rich as a class and his compassion for the victimized and poverty-ridden common man." Certainly Dyke and McTeague elicit some compassion from Norris. One of Dillingham's con- cluding generalizations seems curiously at odds with his earlier claims for Norris' infrequent use of color in his fiction: "Essentially all [Norris] wrote was of a single piece of brightly colored . . . fabric." Such oversights, however, are sparse. They are clearly outweighed by sane, perceptive observations. In sum, Dillingham has successfully revised his dissertation into a book a feat which is becoming rarer these days as the increasing pressure to publish sends half-baked book length manuscripts to and from so many presses.

SEAN O'CASEY A Malone, Maureen. THE PLAYS OF SEAN O'CASEY. Preface by Harry T. Moore. Crosscurrents / Modern Critiques. Southern Illinois University Press, 1969. 169 PP. $4.95. Reviewed by ROBERT HOGAN, University of Delaware Sean O'Casey must be a superb writer. How else could his reputation have grown so enormously in the past ten years, when those same years saw- the publication of a host of books, pamphlets and articles about his work, that were largely characterized by fatuity, pedantry, dullness or bitchiness? This latest book, The Plays of Sean O'Casey by Maureen Malone, is not the worst of the lot, but it is uninformed, uncritical and unnecessary. Miss Malone's intention is two-fold. She attempts to explain the political and social material from which O'Casey shaped his plays, and she attempts to explain what the plays say. Her explanation of the historical and social background, however, ranges from the inadequate to the elementary to the non-existent. For the background of the Easter Rising, she telescopes more than a hundred years of Irish history into a discussion of perhaps 1500 words. Her dis- cussion of the 1913 Lockout consists of eight lines in Chapter 6 and about six paragraphs in Chapter 9. She does give eleven pages of infor- mation about the Battle of Britain, but much of what she says is on the level of the elementary school text. For instance: "After the collapse of France in 1940, Britain stood alone against the Axis Powers, and the struggle known as the Battle of Britain took place." Similarly, many of her other background remarks throughout the book are so astonishingly obvious that one hardly knows what to say. She tells us, for instance, that Red Roses for Me is autobiographical and that Purple Dust "is not intended to be a realistic account of contemporary Ireland." Although she devotes entire chapters to minor plays such as The Star Turns Red or Oak Leaves and Lavender, Miss Malone lumps the best of the excellent late plays all in one chapter. These satiric fantasies about Irish life in the 1940s and 1950s are full of details which O'Casey gleaned from an avid reading of the Irish press. Here there really would have been scope for an historical approach and for new work, but Miss 881</page><page sequence="176">Malone does not give it. Rather, she takes the plays at face value as valid criticisms of contemporary Ireland, of which she apparently knows little or nothing. Her chief authorities on modern Ireland seem to be Blanshard's The Irish and Catholic Power and O'Brien's The Vanishing Irish, both published seventeen years ago and both bearing but a wan and inexact resemblance to Ireland today. There is little point in berating the censorship which hardly exists anymore, and there is no point in referring people to David Krause's criticisms of the Abbey Theatre of ten or fifteen years ago. To depict, as Miss Malone does, a country dominated by clerical Fascism and sexual frigidity is to be ignorant of Mr. Pussy in Baggot Street, of micro-skirts in Stephen's Green, and of Afro-American hairstyles in County Mayo. I hardly mean to imply that there is now such a city as '8Swinging Dublin," but O'Casey's late plays, just as much as Juno and The Plough, picture an historical time now past. Finally, Miss Malone attempts to tell us what O'Casey says. This is a footling waste of time, not only because previous dullards like myself have already done it, but also because no one ever needed to do it. O'Casey's strength is not in philosophical profundities that need expli- cation, but in platitudes that are raised into truth by passion, humor and technique. This volume is not quite on the intellectual level of a student study guide, and its publication by a university press is a grim symptom indeed. C Darin, Doris dePodesta.

Knopf, 1969. 204 pp. $6.95. Reviewed by 191AURICE WOHLGELERNTER, Touro College Frank O'Connor, born Michael O'Donovan, died in March, 1966. Among the many who mourned that silver-headed swain, there were eighteen- writers, scholars, critics and friends- who, under the able editorship of Maurice Sheehy, have gotten "black on white" to record, together, their undying impressions of that great Irishman. From this poignant series of essays that touch almost every aspect of his multi-faceted life, we are able to catch a glimpse of a unique and original man who died, sadly, at the height of his powers. And what, indeed, was the nature of this man? All eighteen seem to be echoing one truth: that he was kind and generous, giving of his time, sympathy, knowledge, and money to those in trouble. And if, on meeting him, one was immediately struck by his "roaring voice," and forrnidable looks the raging eyes, the fiery black eyebrows, the thick gray hair and the gray moustache one soon discerned, also, that those looks con- cealed a very shy and even inexperienced person whose genuine warmth, sensitivity, and tenderness caused him to discover extraordinary merits in the most ordinary people. And yet, he carried, nonetheless, a sharp sword which "could detect evil in the most improbable places." With that 883 </page><page sequence="178">sword, he could-in fact, did strike at mediocrity, piosity, intellectual dishonesty, snuffling smugness, and cruelty masquerading as high prin- ciple. If nothing was too good for a friend, nothing was also too bad for an enemy. In short, he was Irish. Irish as could be, he was, naturally, profoundly in love with his country. Apart from writing, his deepest passion, as Honor Tracy and Shevawn Lynam testify, was Ireland, and it was on "his country and his people that he nourished his brillant imagination." In fact, he joined the Revolu- tionary forces in 1916 to free his country, only to be overcome and placed in a Cork Gaol and prison farm. And if, at times, he was disillusioned with Ireland's turn to materialism and fall from revolutionary grace, and, was, therefore, forced to shake its dust off his feet, it was only because, Pro- fessor Thomas Flanagan assures us, he had long ago decided that "Ireland was morally bound to live up to expectations he had formed in youth." He was, in truth, "fatally and indissolubly married" to it. And yet, O'Connor, like Joyce, understood that, despite his attachment to his land and people, his talents required something bigger and grander than Republican Ireland. But, unlike Joyce, he did not allow himself the luxury of a self-imposed exile and, except for occasional visits to the continent and America, remained, instead, on his native soil. However, to compensate for his natural antipathy to much of contemporary Irish society, and, what is worse, its parochialism, he began, under the in- spiration of Daniel Corkery, an intensive study of the Irish language and literature of the past, especially that of the eighth and eighteenth cen- turies. Witness, for example, his posthumous volume, co-edited with Professor David Greene, A Golden Treasury of Irish Poetry, A. D. 600- 1200. And all this, surprisingly, without benefit of a formal education. Once introduced to the beauty of language, he worked tirelessly at Old and Middle Irish, to the point where he was considered "one of the great translators of our age." For him, apparently, Nil hibernici alienum. And what is, further, so interesting is that he was revolted by the "scholarly apparatus," or what the Germans call die Zunftiwissenschaft, because his basic approach to scholarship, as Professor D. A. Benchy carefully notes, was, like so much else, intuitive. And this intuition was, at times, "so overwhelming as to leave a professional scholar gasping with amaze- ment." And what is no less amazing is the fact that he approached the art of teaching with similar "intuitiveness." For that we need only look to the expert testimony of Professors Richard Ellmann, Richard T. Gill, Wallace Stegner, and Philip Edwards who, respectively, observed his wanderings through the groves of academe, at Northwestern, Harvard, and Stanford in the early fifties, and Trinity College, Dublin, in the early sixties. Apart from his captivating lectures and readings, done with an oratorical flair of which he alone was capable, he made every class, especially the seminars in creative writing, "a challenge, from his entrance to the bell; every lecture, a performance." Second, he did not waste time on "academic dissection," but utilized his time instead, to convey his judg- ments which were always personal and unhedged and, hence, "frequently dangerous." What he was after, in his "unprofessional manner," was, it 884</page><page sequence="179">appears, the "transmission, the meeting, the artist's intention and the means by which it was immediately manifest to a reader." Little wonder, therefore, that "teaching took so much out of him, both physically and spiritually"; that he could not, would not, "toss off" a course of lectures as "professionals" do; that, true to character, he "be- came so involved in his students' work that he completely lost sight of his own." "Professor O'Connor" was unique. Because behavior and thought were for him the same, O'Connor was, above all, a unique artist. Unlike Joyce, he rejected the idea that an artist could maintain a detachment from his art or, in terms of his work, serve as a "God paring his nails," unmoved by the world of his creation. Thus, pervading all his work are the moral issues resulting from isolation and human loneliness. Because this mood of loneliness, fear, and desolation is central to his stories, he sought to develop the contact "which would, in great measure, alleviate this absurd human condition." A solitary figure, for O'Connor, cannot have a real identity since "he is cut loose from life, from everything that gives meaning to his existence." And a great part of that existence rested on family and community ties. We always feel in his works a "need for companionship, a pull towards contact and reintegration, and a desire to work out ways of reconciliation within the span of human life." Small wonder, therefore, that O'Connor, despite his being "Michael O'Donovan's wild son," ab- horred violence. The aesthetics of violence, developed strongly in much of contemporary, particularly American, literature was foreign to his taste and writings. He held fast to his view that one "cannot be a good writer without being a good man." Thus, O'Connor's voice, face, innocent nature, and knowledge of the world as well as his writing, translating, and editing were all one. His manifold activities were all part of being a man. To that old question whether politics, aesthetics, teaching and controversy are any part of the duty of a creative artist, O'Connor's answer would have been a resounding"yes." And all because he had, though an Irishman to the core, a seriousness rarely found in his mercurial race. As a result, he preserved his personal integrity to the end. And if, at the end, one mourns that the "last of the woods is down," one also knows, because these excellent studies will surely move the serious reader to reread him, that he will flourish once more.

BAIRD SHUMAN, Duke University Clifford Odets: The Thirties and After is a valuable and essential book tc students of modern American drama. In it Edward Murray has exploded two significant myths regarding the playwright and has presented thought- ful and provocative analyses of eight Odets plays Awake and Sing!, 885</page><page sequence="180">Golden Boy, Rocket to the Moon, Night Music, Clash by Night, The Big Knife, The Country Girl, and The Flowering Peach. The first myth which Murray explodes is that Odets was essentially a proletarian playwright. He demonstrates rather convincingly that after the production of Waiting for Lefty "Odets was moving away from 'prole- tarian drama"' toward writing which "has a rich personal, or psychologi- cal dimension and a level of thematic concern which resists glib labels." One might wish to quarrel with Murray's dismissal of Waiting for Lefty as a "crude early effort." Murray also explodes the myth, one which Odets himself perpetrated, that the dramatist was influenced significantly by Chekhov and employed Chekhovian devices in producing his plays' more than Ibsenite devices. Indeed, Odets had said in an interview with Michael Mendelsohn in 1963, "I was influenced a little by Chekhov. Not by Ibsen, because you see my forms are not Ibsen's" ("Odets at Center Stage," Theater Arts, XLVII [1963]). Murray demonstrates quite well that although Odets used "such Chekhovian surface techniques as cross-purpose dialogue," the "basic structure of an Odets play is Ibsenite; that is, one can perceive in it a single rising line of action which can be analyzed in terms of a point of attack, a turning point, and a resolution composed of a crisis, climax and conclusion." Murray quite correctly and perspicaciously asserts that "It was Odets' achievement to integrate a basic Ibsenite action with certain structural techniques of a Chekhov play, and thus assure his work a rising line of tension while simultaneously enriching the piece by counterpoint and the indirect expression of emotion and feeling." One might question the validity of some of Murray's psychological interpretations. He somewhat overstates the "oral orientation" of Awake and Sing! (see particularly pp. 45-50, passim, in which he equates oranges and mammary glands); however, he brilliantly interprets The Country Girl in similar terms, justifiably characterizing Frank Elgin as "an orally re- gressed neurotic" and suggesting that the latter play may well represent a "negative oedipus complex" which is "merely a later 'rescue station' from a basic oral regression." Frank's alcoholism is a classic example of oral regression, and Murray presents compelling and convincing evidence to support his psychological interpretation of this play. He also makes abundantly clear the need for a more fully developed psychological interpretation of the full corpus of Odets' work, an interpretation which will be forthcoming hopefully in a work now being prepared by Margaret B. Gibson, a practicing psychologist who was a close friend of Odets. This reviewer finds it impossible to go along with Murray's contention that "Rocket to the Moon: A Romance in Three Acts . . . is one of Clifford Odets' finest plays." This play, almost universally condemned by critics and rejected by audiences, despite Murray's effort to prove otherwise, has none of the muscle of Odets' better work such as Golden Boy, The Big Knife, and The Flowering Peach. When Murray quotes nearly a full page of extremely banal dialogue from the play and follows it with the statement that "There is a Iyrical breathlessness here, a balance of romantic urgency and wry humor, and a strong dramatic line," one turns back the page and rereads the dialogue but is unconvinced after a rereading that Murray has based his statement on the preceding dialogue. 886</page><page sequence="181">Some readers might be offended by a certain breeziness in Murray's style; he is especially given to the use of sentence fragments to achieve this breeziness. Nevertheless, the book moves well for the most part. A few minor factual errors creep in such as that on page 37 where Ralph Berger (in Awake and Singt) is mistakenly identified as Jacob's nephew rather than as his grandson. One would wish that Murray had had access to some additional sources which would have been extremely valuable to him: Arthur Wagner's Technique in the Revolutionary Plays of Clifford Odets (Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford University, 1962); Michael Mendel- sohn's Clifford Odets: A Critical Study (Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Colorado, 1963), published last year by Everett/Edwards, Inc.; David Kuryk's Love's Thin Awkward P/ant (Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Wis- consin, 1965); Richard E. Wilson's A Directorts Production Book for Clif- ford Odets' The Flowering Peach (Master's thesis, Stanford University, 1959); and William L. Van Hettinga's The Theme of Nonfulfillment in Three Plays of Clifford Odets (Master's thesis, Duke University, 1960). The. book would also be more useful had it had an index. E Willett, Ralph.

New York, 1968.152 pp. $4.50. Reviewed by JOANNE TRAUTMANN, Drexel University Professor Doyle's treatment of Sean O'Faolain in the Twayne manner has attained that series' standard of mediocrity. The author provides quickly, adequately- biographical details and bibliographic information. He sur- veys adequately O'Faolain's career as a writer of short stories, novels, criticism, and polemics. He does all this in a style which for the most part serves him adequately, but too often becomes trite or plodding. In one respect only is this book outstanding. Doyle devotes a chapter to admiring what is most unusual about O'Faolain's career: while other major Irish writers have fled their homeland to take up residence far from the censors, the clerics, and the deceptively quaint Irish middle class, O'Faolain remained to fight. From his position as editor of the monthly cultural journal called The Be/l, he nagged Ireland into the twentieth century. He attacked what he regarded as provincial, puritani- cal, and philistine about Irish life. One reason O'Faolain remains is that the Irish give him a fine oppor- tunity to work out stories illustrating his basic philosophical stance. As he indicates in his autobiography, Vive Moi!, he believes that in spite of life's inevitable fragmentation, one must behave as if wholeness were possible. To achieve wholeness for himself, at once sentimentally emo- tional and keenly intellectual, and for his countrymen, those extraordi- narily hard-headed, tender-hearted people, is the goal of O'Faolain's writing. 887</page><page sequence="182">Doyle does not emphasize O'Faolain's penchant for seeing life dualistically. But the critic does trace O'Faolain's development and it has been development, not merely changc as the goal of wholeness is sought. As a young, idealistic participant in the Irish "Troubles" with England and in the Civil War of 1922, O'Faolain thought he had found that wholeness. In his first collection of stories, Midsummer Night Madness (1932) he recreates those war years with, as Doyle stresses, remarkable visual details. Dealing with each story through the standard, unimagina- tive, but clear method of detailed summary, comment on themes, an- notated list of weaknesses, and final evaluation, Doyle concludes that the collection is too heavily romantic, but is nonetheless a "notable beginning for a creative writing career." It is indeed. In fact, "Fugue," a story which superbly blends form and content, is one of O'Faolain's finest stories. It is also a splendid example of what has come to be known as Iyrical fiction. O'Faolain's ability to capture beauty his specialties in this first volume seem to be dawns and women-make him unusual in a country which has produced so many humorous action tales. Fortunately, O'Faolain has not lost this ability by the time of his second coll-ection, A Purse of Coppers (1937), but he has subdued his tendency to melodrama. This is his starkest volume. This is the one which really does demand comparison with Dubliners. (All Irish short story collections are inevitably compared with Joyce's.) In the first collection O'Faolain saw life as a series of tense, idealistic feats. In the second he cuts out all but life's depressing, faint-hearted moments. He has not yet come to terms with his own or Irish extremes. Professor Doyle deals with this book and the later collections-The Man Who Invented Sin (1948), The Finest of Sean O'Faolain (1957), and I Remember! I Rememberl (1961)-by choosing representative stories to examine. (The Heat of the Sun, 1966, is quite rightly given little atten- tion, for it is not especially different from his earlier collections; nor is it especially good.) "Representative" usually means those stories which Doyle regards as the best. It would be quibbling to challenge most of his choices. But it would be incompetent not to express surprise at a few selections and interpretations. I wonder, for example, why he finds "Up the Bare Stairs" engrossing when its ironies are so blunt. He wisely slights "Innocence" and "Unholy Living and Half Dying," stories built around situations more suited to the talents of O'Faolain's friend Frank O'Connor and perhaps influenced by him. But why does Doyle pass over the lovely O'Flaherty-like story called "The Trout"? I must also object to his over-simplification of "The Silence of the Valley" and his inability to see and consequently to praise the satire, even though it is not consistent, in 'Teresa." Doyle's most perceptive treatment of the short stories is his discussion of I Remember! I Remember! In spite of some embarrassingly unsophis- ticated philosophizing ("Can one ever accept reality? . . . Unquestionably, some form of compromise must be involved since that is the way an individual must usually play the game of life or else be destroyed"), he 888</page><page sequence="183">writes well about how O'Faolain's stories achieve, at last, a blend of sensibility and intelligence. It is a little difficult to recall that O'Faolain is a novelist. He has, in fact, written three novels-A Nest of Simple Folk, 1933; Bird Alone, 1936; Come Back to Erin, 194to which Doyle devotes one chapter. He over- praises the first one and underrates the second, but in general his comments are at least thorough. Except for Bird Alone, which deserves to be read because it is an intense, moving picture of sin, a concept which still applies in Ireland, I am inclined to agree with Doyle's implication that the novels are more interesting as sociological glosses than as aesthetic entities. Doyle's research for this book is admirable. He has recognized that John V. Kelleher ought always to be listened to on the subject of O'Faolain. The author did not see Maurice Harmon's book (Sean O'- Faolain: a Critical Introduction. University of Notre Dame Press, 1967), so he relies on reviews. He does not see the value of much of what Frank O'Connor has to say about his friend. But Doyle does use wisely O'Faolain's own impressive literary criticism. Doyle's final evaluation of O'Faolain praises his work on The Be11 ("the Irish Matthew Arnold"), his increasing mastery of the short story form, his compassion, and his irony. The conclusion is inevitable: O'Faolain becomes"the Irish Chekhov." LIAM O'FLAHERTY A Zneimer, John. THE LITERARY VISION OF LIAM O'FLAHER1Y. Syracuse Un;- versity Press, 1970. 208 pp. $7.95.

WILFRED OWEN A White, Gertrude M. WILFRED OWEN. Twayne's English Authors Series, No. 86. New York, 1969. 000 pp. $4.50. Reviewed by /ANIS TIM HANSEN, University of Puget Sound In Mrs. White's study of Wilfred Owen, some shibboleths of contem- porary academic criticism fail both as measures of a poet's sensibilities and as a framework for the scholar's sensitivities The result is a very mixed study of Owen's life, poetry, and achievement. Among the dubious standards which Mrs. White struggles with are that the English poetry of the 1890's and early 1900's is "lush," a flaw 890</page><page sequence="185">descending from Keats; that V\/orld War I changed all that by wrenching Owen and a few others back to the ironic cruelties of "real life"; that poetry must neither be didactic nor merely "Poetry"; and that any negative criticism of a favorite must be demolished. (I trust that this list indicates the specific qualities of academic better yet, merely academic criticism found objectionable.) Common to her hit-and-run battles with each of these is the very clear sense that Mrs. White's sensitivities are simply better and more applicable than the shibboleths. The first two are allowed to dominate the first chapter, "The Growth of a Poet's Mind," and the second, "'Weald of Youth': The Early Poetry." The first chapter traces Owen's early life, emphasizing those forces in his later experience which replaced the dreaminess and other-worldliness of his youth and early adolescence. In addition to a protective mother, described as a person for whom "what was not nice must never be acknowledged," Owen "had early fallen in love with Keats." Mrs. White says that these forces lead him to write what he later rejected as "Poetry:" "Poetry" . . . must early have meant to him . . . beauty of word or cadence, titillation of the senses, a rather vaporous and sentimental "uplift," a highly subjective dalliance with a world of brightly colored fantasy, a chance to dream and to dramatize, to test his own identity and to experiment with many attitudes and roles. Now one hardly needs to advocate swooning masculinity to note the narrowness of this definition, especially if he sees Owen's reaction to war as a complex trauma involving more than just becoming aware of "reality." This bias leads in Chapter 11 to some unfortunate observations on the exact nature of the early poetry. The discussion of Keats' influence ends with some lines from "On My Songs" followed by this reflection by Mrs. White: "How has divine poesy fallen from her high estate and all her enchantments become merely a nursery spell against neurosis!" While it would be nice to credit Mrs. White with a satiric flourish, a good deal of the rhetoric in these chapters shows the degree to which homage to the shibboleths dominates her writing. The above quotation also indicates the narrowness of Mrs. White's working definition of "Poetry" and enables the reader to foresee the trouble she has with Owen's use of the terms "Pity" and "Warn" from the justly famous "Preface." It is an article of faith that while the poet must deal with "reality," he must equally avoid "propaganda" and (worse yet) "message." Mrs. White deals with these difficulties much more quickly by using "empathy" and "vision" as synonyms, but she still disconcerts the reader by what by this point in the book are clearly only marginally applicable standards. Owen is just not a poet who rigorously excluded his anger over specific historical events or forces from his poems. Mrs. White is on sounder ground when she observes that he wrote poems in which the specifics of World War I become symbolic of man's depraved ways to his fellow men and to Nature herself. Skipping for the moment chapters three and four, the final chapters, on Owen's reputation and achievement, are much too dominated by Mrs. White's excessive concern over Yeats's negative reaction to the passivity 891</page><page sequence="186">of the war poems and Joseph Cohen's belief that latent homosexuality is the /'key" to Owen's poetry. The former assessment could be credited quickly to differences in temperament, and the latter could be simply dismissed as speculative, if not unproductive. As it is, they take up nearly ten of the last thirty-eight pages of the book, and that with no significant result. Chapters three and four, comprising only 48 of the book!s 148 pages, discuss Owen's war poems with emphasis on technique; they also illus- trate sound scholarship in the service of a perceptive mind. While the discussion of "pararhyme" searches somewhat unconvincingly for its source, her grasp of Owen's techniques is sure and extremely enlighten- ing. Obviously, my choosing a few examples could not do justice to her detailed analyses; the reader is urged to pursue these chapters at his early convenience. I trust that this book will be read, and not only by students of Wilfred Owen. It does show the value of remembering Samuel Johnsonts injunc- tion to separate critical principles which are right because they are ac- cepted from those which are accepted because they are right, but more importantly it says much about poetic technique while discussing those Owen used with such distinction. DOROTHY PARKER A Keats, John. YOU MiGHT AS WELL LIVE: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF OOROTHY PARKER. Simon and Shuster, 1970. 320 pp. $7.50. In spite of Dorothy Parker's wish that her biography never be written, Keats argues that she was 'a public figure of whom biographies are bound to be written, and . . . an authoritative attempt should be made now to gather and present the facts as well as the legend while they are still fresh in living memories." Keats's effort in that direction falls in the popular rather than scholarly category of biography, but because he does a responsible job of separating facts from legend, his book is a valuable contribution to the understanding of not only Dorothy Parker, but also of the literary-social history of this century. He plays down the celebrated wit of his subject and gives us an uncompromising portrait of a woman whose light-hearted style of living and writing masked bitter unhappiness and a life-long impulse towards self-destruction. With nostalgia now in fashion, it is to Keats's credit that he resisted the impulse to play up the romantic aspects of the 1920s and 1930s. He shows instead that in "the age of the wisecrack" even the celebrated Algonquin Wits were more vicious and less clever than they thought, and his account of [)orothy Parker's courageous efforts to further liberal causes at a time when such activity endangered her career as a Hollywood screenwriter helps to make her seem less the representative writer of her times than one who in some ways at least was superior to the age in which she lived. More extensively researched biographies of Dorothy Parker may indeed appear, but until then Keats's book is a readable and informative account of her life and times. 892</page><page sequence="187">BORIS PASTERNAK C H ughes, Olga Raevsky.

Evans, Lawrence, ed. LETTERS OF WALTER PATER. Oxford University Press, 1970.182 pp. $8.00. Reviewed by ROBERT M. SCOTTO, St. John's University, Jamaica, New York Within the past ten years a large number of full-length studies of Walter Pater have been published. The increased interest in this enigmatic Victorian, however, is often more indicative of his influence on later writers who considered him inspirational and, indeed, normative, than it is of his own special talent. One would expect that these two new books, then, the only attempt ever made to collect all of Pater's letters, and a study of his "relativism" and "modernity," would help secure his reputation even more firmly, in spite of his influence rather than because of it. The reader would be disappointed, however, and the fault is partially Pater's. In Lawrence Evanst admirably edited and thoroughly researched Letters, we read of Pater's admitting at least three times (pp. 52, 80, 129) that he is not a good letter writer and that letters are for him a poor means of communication. We are advised by Evans that most of the letters Pater probably wrote during his lifetime are missing, and that Pater did seek some public approval for his work through his correspond- ence, but still the unfortunate conclusion is that little can be learned about him from his letters because he chose, quite simply, not to write. Certain negative facts are ascertainable, however. The fragmentary nature of Pater's correspondence as well as the twenty-four unpublished and, in most cases) unpolished manuscripts collected in the Houghton Library at Harvard reveal how much Pater did not finish during his career, how 893</page><page sequence="188">incomplete, how fragmentary, how "modern" he was. (Mr. Evans, by the way, is the trustee for the Pater papers, and the present book is based upon his 1961 Harvard thesis.) For instance, the early autobiographical portrait, "The Child in the House," was at one time part of a projected second series of Imaginary Portraits which was never realized; Marius the Epicurean was originally conceived as the first part of a trilogy, to be followed by the unfinished Gaston de Latour (a couple of chapters which did not even get to be serialized in lklacmillan's Magazine are at Harvard), and another novel set at "the end of the last century- and the scene, England" and not even begun, although "An English Poet" might be a sketch. Pater often hints at lines of thought which he never fully ex- plored, even in the fragments. He demonstrates his "modernity," for instance, by defending, with reservations, a program in English literature at Oxford in a letter to the Pall Mall Gazette (1886), seven years before it was officially adopted, or by frequently praising, though again with modest reserve, the early works of writers like Moore, Symons, Wilde and Gosse. He also reveals, in three different places, how important religion was to him, and how Marius might be interpreted less as a defense of epicureanism than as an attempt to convey a "religious phase possible for the modern mind" (italics mine). But these revelations are minimal, and most of the letters are not important to the critic. Evans, however, provides a complete edition: the introduction is brief but enlightening, the notes are copious and complete, and the skeletal picture of Pater the correspondent (alas) as fully rounded as possible. But the difficulty of explaining Pater might also be the fault of the critic who does not take full advantage of whatever precious little Pater has to offer. Richmond Crinkley's Walter Pater: Humanist is such a case. The author attempts to do something important: to suggest that some of the complex ideas Pater treated in his books are indisputably "modern." As A. E. once cynically observed, much of twentieth century literature is "infected" by "Pater's relative," and it is this concept precisely (although Crinkley does not use this quotation) which he attempts to define: how transient life is to Pater, how art (especially good prose) synthesizes, pre- serves and transmits "the human image," and, in the book's most sig- nificant chapter, how Marius, Pater's fictionalized relativistic credo, drama- tizes Pater's "humanism" more effectively than any other of his works. Mr. Crinkley's treatment, however, though well-ordered, has many gaps, mainly because he does not make use of some very important material. For example, in his argument for Pater's Arnoldian sense of isolation and discontent in the modern world (Chapter I) he could have cited an essay in the Harvard collection called "The Young Romantics," in which Pater develops just this point. For his argument on Pater's theory of modern art (Chapter II), an untitled survey of English literature (M.S. 13), in which Pater defines many aspects of his theory of criticism, would have been valuable. Further, when he explains the role of religion in Pater's works (Chapter lil), two essays, "Art and Religion," which includes "Thoughts," - possibly intended at one time for inclusion in Marius and an untitled sequel (M.S. 17) are almost necessary, as well as Anthony Ward's per- suasive use of them in Walter Pater, The Idea in Nature (London, 1966). Finally, in Chapter V, Pater's letters might have been helpful in discussing 894</page><page sequence="189">the religious dimensions of Marius and the thematic continuity through- out all of Pater's uncollected imaginary portraits. Because Crinkley's use of source material is not what it should be, neither is his argument, and his book, which leaves the impression of sketchiness and deja vu, simply does not afford adequate support for his credible thesis.

POlJLIN, IR., Saint Francis College The cult of Sylvia Plath that mushroomed quickly after her death and the publication of Ariel had very little to do with her poetry. Like the cult of Dylan Thomas, it sought out the private person rather than the public voice; it dessected the wounded and terrified psyche rather than tracing the act of poetry; it ignored the range of emotion, the humor, the crafts- manship and the ultimate affirmation of art and gloated over the final and irrevocable despair. Poets and serious critics contributed to the cult as much as did Time: they engaged in a kind of macabre voyeurism as much as did sophisticates along the literary cocktail-party circuit. In his introduction to this garland, Charles Newman, editor of Tri- Quarterly, states that the basic intent of the volume is to place Sylvia Plath's work "in a serviceable perspective, indicate something of the real measure of her achievement.tt And the annotated outline of the book in the table of contents promises essays which attempt "to place Sylvia Plath's work in some intellectual and cultural perspective," essays "eluci- dating [her] work through its imagery and metre," "biographical and reminiscent [pieces] situating the poems in time and place," short reviews and comments on individual works. (The collection also includes some fifteen unpublished or uncollected poems and prose pieces, photographs of seven versions of a poem ["Thalidomide"] from the first handwritten draft to the final typed draft, three pen drawings by Sylvia Plath and an incomplete and generally annotated checklist of criticism compiled by Mary Kinzie.) Unfortunately the book promises more than it delivers to be a truly serviceable contribution to a balanced appreciation of Sylvia Plath's achievement. Too many of these seventeen essays are reprints probably quite familiar to serious students of Sylvia Plath's work: two or three cen- tral reviews of Ariel, six essays which originally appeared in Tri-Quarterly's "Womanly Issue" (Fall, 1966), while others are selections from various easily accessible books like M. L. Rosenthal's The New Poets and Richard Howard's Alone with America. More important, too many of these were also written relatively soon after her death and the publication of Ariel, and they are marred by a lack of distance when they aren't simply con- tributions to the culte In these it's not Sylvia Plath's poetry that is central, but her dying. 896</page><page sequence="191">Only three or four of the essays submit Sylvia Plath's poetry to the kind of rigorous critical analysis which it demands and should receive if it is to survive the morbid sentimentalism of cult criticism. The worth- while essays include John Frederick Nims's technical analysis, a study of metaphor, stanza-form, rhythm diction, and other aspects of Sylvia Plath's poetry, an essay which begins with a kind of oldfashioned defense of "those things which have made up the physical body of poetry in all times and places," but which also proves to be eminently sane and useful. Another is Edward Lucie Smith's analysis of the continuity of Sylvia Plath's work through her use of imagery, especially imagery of the sea, on the basis of which he is able to argue convincingly enough against the theory that she was an @'extremist" artist. The third is Anne Lavers' "The World as Icon." Based on her attempt to translate Sylvia Plath's poems, the essay reflects a very close reading of the poems. Miss Lavers argues that "the poems are essentially emblematic. They derive their meaning . . . from an underlying code.... This code is extremely rigid/ inasmuch as an object, once charged with given signification, never forfeits it...." This essay is also interesting in that its premise leads the author to suggest at least (and at last) that a close analysis of Sylvia Plath's poems, as poems, "reduces considerably the relevance of whether some allusions are per- sonal or not...." The Art of Sylvia Plath was an inevitable book, and it is a beginning. But hopefully subsequent authors and editors will keep in mind Sylvia Plath's own demands of even the most personal and experiential poems- especially her own: "i think my poems come immediately out of the sensuous and emotional experiences I have, but I must say I cannot sympathize with these cries from the heart that are informed by nothing except, you know, a needle or a knife, or whatever it is. I believe one should be able to control and manipulate experiences, even the most terrifying, like madness, like being tortured . . . with an informed and intelligent mind...." E Gordon, Jan B.

University of Miami Press, 1970. 212 pp. $5.95. Reviewed by EDWIN FUSSELL, University of California, San Diego This is a book ready-made for under-estimation. Until you get to the end, the structure seems mad: a long exegesis of Canto 4, a long exegesis of Canto 82, connected with a meander on Odysseus as Poundian hero- type, followed by a brief Epilogue unpromisingly entitled "Amo Ergo Sum." Abstractly considered, it would seem difficult to invent a critical approach (form) more spectacularly irresponsible. The actual experience of reading the book is quite the reverse. It breaches only at the end. Moreover, the reader who perseveres to the end is suddenly overwhelmed by the obvious truth that there would have been no breaching without the cetology. OK, start from scratch. Baumann can read as poetry (i.e., without smashing it down to prose!, and almost without lapse or inter- mission, two of the more difficult cantos. (Few others can do that.) From this apparently limited achievement emerges a major principle: the Cantos can be read. Until we get a decent variorum edition, this feat demands enormous labor and learning. Baumann has worked hard and sensitively to acquire the significant learning. (1) He can grasp not only Pound's thematic meanings, but he can also shed light on Pound's tech- niques of allusion, juxtaposition, fusion, ellipsis, timing, etc. (2) Further- here is where the careless reader is in danger of missing the valuc he can also relate the word-by-word, line-by-line explication of the single passage to the rest of the Cantos (not everything in them, of course), and place it in the context of Pound's entire oeuvre plus practically every- thing that Pound has discoverably read or that is known about his life. If, for example, Baumann explains an obscure reference to Swinburne, he also gives us all the available information about Swinburne and Pound. It may sound pedantic, but it doesn't work that way. Illumination spreads. Things increase and multiply. And that is why the rewards are not only ongoing and outspreading but terminal. Baumann's final generalizations about the Cantos are decently skeptical and partial. (Obviously. Necessarily.) It by no means follows that the trial was a failure. At least we now know that '8paraphras- ing and indexing" are not"the answer," and that is much. Baumann then heroically faces the question whether the Cantos can as a unified totality be read at all. Perhaps too modestly, he ventures no final conclusion, though I think the results of his own method have already suggested the probable answer: "Yes; in time." Instead, Baumann establishes some less arguable (but not on that account the less fascinating or important) check-points about what he calls the poem's "magnetic center." It is first of all a poetic technique, hammered out c. 1917-1920, for the accurate registration of stimuli (including states of mind, feeling, soul), "and out of this the Cantos grew up into a compendium of all the things that have ever acted as proper stimuli on Pound it became both a Guide to Culture and an intellectual and spiritual autobiography." Baumann then analyzes the nature of Pound's religious visions, and con- 898</page><page sequence="193">cludes, rightly, I think, that his intuitions of the divine (however unortho- dox), enclosing and penetrating our lives, are vastly more important than Pound's opinions, and much nearer the heart of the poetry. It is, of course, impossible to divorce religion, politics, and poetry (for one thing, they coalesce in ethics). Baumann puts them together in a novel and intriguing way. "Stripped of his eagerness to write hard, clear-cut verse Pound, with his platonistic love of beauty, his revolutionary zeal and the idea of the perfectability of man, is far more of a modern Shelley than we are inclined to believe." One last point (the author's, not mine). What is absolutely bed-rock in the Cantos are what Baumann calls the nature Iyrics. From them flow Pound's organic emphasis on fertility, natural increase, abundance and distribution. Gold, on the other hand, is inorganic, and its adoption as a basis for money becomes what Baumann calls Pound's equivalent for the fall of man. ("Nature," for Pound, is overwhelmingly the organic world.) Caught in this bind, we are impelled to think (not necessarily Pound's thoughts, of course). We think because we want to know, and we do not know. This is a human "good," and therefore, ideally, "to think is to love, and to love is to perceive with 'strong tastes."' Strong tastes, unfortunately, may make us "furious from perception . . . and engender its very op- posite, hate.... Here is the great tension that has so largely determined Pound's life." Granted these assumptions, however, the heroic quest after knowledgeable love is a categorical imperative: "If man's first aim is to live a full life, he will for ever try to make his love a full love, and that is achieved by desiring to know." Despite Pound's many follies and sins- which Baumann never condones or glosses over (he doesn't need to: he's sailed through that gate and out) Pound has tried for the heroic life and the epic poem. Naturally, the result is mixed. The perfectability of man (not the perfection of man), despite the usual chorus of sophomore sneers, is a respectable, indeed a moving, article of faith and an actual phenomenon of our everyday lives. Yet imperfection glares at us from every gaping wound in the universe. Baumann knows that, and he knows that Pound knows it, and therefore signs off, he and Pound together, with one of Pound's choicer remarks: "It is difficult to write a paradiso when all the superficial indications are that you ought to write an apocalypse." The most praiseworthy thing about this book is that the author, emulating Pound, decided not to lie down and die but to get to work. Pearlman, Daniel D. THE BARB OF TIME: ON THE UNITY OF EZRA POUND'S CANTOS. Oxford University Press, 1969. 318 pp. $8.50. Reviewed by WILLIAM W. VASSE, University of Michigan at Flint Professor Pearlman offers us the first truly coherent book-length study of Ezra Pound's Cantos. It is perhaps not surprising that he also discovers in the poem a highly schematic and rather traditional pattern of coherence. The will-o'-the-wisp of Pound criticism is a "major form" in the Cantos which will relate individual parts to an artistic whole and exhibit a thematic development from a recognizable beginning to a teleological 899</page><page sequence="194">EZRA POUND conclusion. For Pearlman, the central theme is "time." The development is analogous to Dante's three-stage journey. Together they provide the major form of the poem: a '8progressive conceptual and spiritual devel- opment which no one but a poet of great architectonic genius and mental elasticity could have carved out over so many years, 'Braving time.'t' Altholugh parallels with the Commedia have long been a staple of Pound criticism and many have remarked that Poundt like other modernist poets, has been inordinately preoccupied with time, here the two have been combined in a reading of the poem that is intricate, informative, and, within its limits, persuasive. Two concepts of time appear in the Cantos: the linear time of history as conceived by the rationalist Western mind caught in an inflexible order of past, present, future; and the cyclical time of organic nature to whose cosmic rhythms archaic man was attuned before the natural world was desacralized by Hebrew and Christian insistence on a transcendent deity. Historical time's mechanical order produces fragmentation, disorder, and decay. But cyclical time can "Make It New" by establishing the eternal return of archetypal harmonies and truths. The two @times" in inevitable conflict gather to their opposing poles all of Pound's well-known preju- dices. All that is mechanical, individualistic, usurioust Christian, abstract, dichotomized, relativistic, and democratic is a product of the linear time- sense. The organic, communal, distributive, Confucian, concrete, coherent, hierarchic, and totalitarian belong to cyclical time. The "plot" of the Cantos represents the poet's struggle to liberate the human spirit from the chaos of linear time and bring it fully into the realm of cosmic consciousness. The first stage (Cantos 1-46) is Poundrs Infernoo where the time-bound spirit of Western man strives to establish some political, moral, and artistic order. A few heroes like Sigismondo Malatesta make small gains, but what might have been a total civilization is defeated by the fragmentation of linear time, making inevitable the West's tragic violation of natural order. The Purgatorio (Cantos 31-71 ) begins to emerge while apocalyptic visions of historical disorder are still dominant. Pound slurveys those societies, especially the Chinese, whose leaders perceived the essential coinherence of natural order and human community. In so far as they observed the times and acted in due season, these leaders (Jefferson, Adams, various Chinese emperors, Mussolini) successfully implemented the ancient wisdom of nature that Confucian- ism formulates. The Paradiso is the Pisan sequence of cantos (74-84). Now spirit triumphs as the poet "conquers by undergoing a profound mystical experience which reveals to him the illusory nature of historical time and place, and consequently even of his own ego." Time transcended, the poet as representative man experiences directly the order of Love, which radiates through the created universe and is manifest in its coherent pattern. Within this framework, the author provides close readings of cantos that are crucial to each stage of thematic development. Pearlman's approach is purely descriptive; he makes no attempt to evaluate Pound's ideas or to weigh the consequences of his attempt to escape the burden of history. What he sees in the poem the theme of time, conflict of opposites, structures of triplets, and Pound's urge toward transcendence- is indeed there. If the critic has emphasized the sche- matic design of his own ideas while obscuring somewhat the miscel- 9oo</page><page sequence="195">laneous richness of Pound's, this study nevertheless provides us with a sustained reading of the first eighty-four cantos. But problems of method- ology limit its usefulness. Because Pearlman seems compelled to make everything fit into some identifiable category of his grand design, he often succumbs to the temptation to translate the pure immediacy of Pound's imagery into abstractions of symbolic "meaning." In his reading of Canto 49 one of the most illuminating in the book-he transforms "Fire from frozen cloud, heavy rain in the twilight / Under the cabin roof was one lantern" into the last glimmering of the light which once unified civilization and a battered "ship of state" unable to contend with the elements. Soon one loses sight of the Cantos as a poem; it becomes instead a sacred text to be allegorized. Pearlman locates the climax of the Cantos just slightly past the three- quarter mark of the poem as it now stands. He has not considered the post-Pisan cantos except to express his conviction that these further formulate and clarify the visionary experience of the Pisan Cantos. Yet the reader of Rock-Drill and Thrones finds Pound striving toward the Neoplatonic "light" as if the measure of transcendence previously achieved was somehow insufficient, or possibly even a mistake. The dualities seemingly resolved appear again in even more virulent form. Since Pearlman's thesis depends so much on Pound's sense of a necessary conclusion, to ignore the last thirty-three cantos and fragments seems an obvious begging of the basic question: whether the poem as a whole has a major form. That Pound himself seems at the last to think not is perhaps beside the point. For all its ingenuity and genuine informative value, this study demonstrates that to see Pound's Cantos with such systematic steadiness probably precludes one's seeing the poem whole- if that is possible at all. Stock, Noel. THE LIFE OF EZRA POUND. Pantheon Books, 1970. 472 pp. $10. Reviewed by THOMAS /ACKSON, Bryn Mawr College This is the first biography of Ezra Pound by anyone close to the man him- self. It is the most detailed, informed, and at least compared to the full- length biographies-the most intelligent one to date. (Its nearest com- petitor in terms of detail, and its superior in intelligence, Patricia Hut- chins' Ezra Pound's Kensington, is limited to relatively few years.) Stock is privy to information no previous Pound biographer has had available, and so far as sheer information is concerned he has made good use of his privileges. He gives, for example, a more detailed account of Pound's life and activities in Italy during the Thirties and Forties than we have yet had, and he has a good deal more to say about the poet's private life than anyone else has had. By the welter of information he presents, Stock conveys some concrete sense of the unbelievable energy with which Pound has pursued his career, and here and there he succeeds in con- veying some of the pathos of a poetic career often frustrated and per- haps finally spoiled by the necessary and unnecessary scattering of ener- gies entailed by Pound's attempt to foster the health of Western civili- zation single-handed. 901</page><page sequence="196">EZRA POUND Stock deals with Pound's work as well as with the facts of his life. As we might expect from him after his book Reading the Cantos, the criticism is mainly negative; with Noel Stock for a friend, Pound doesn't need any enemies. The criticism is also very bad facilet condescending, over-general, and too laden with Pound's own catch-words to be of much help to the understanding. There is a three-page summary of A Draft of XXX Cantos, for example, that reads {ike something out of Masterplots in its utter imperception of poetic issues -not to mention its quite unjustifiedly patronizing tone: ("Cantos 8 to 11 are his life of Sigis- mundo Malatesta. By quoting documents and describing or listing inci- dents and people in Malatestats life Pound attempts to register his idea of Malatesta as a ruler who in a small town wanted civilization and by intelligence and will-power got it.") The book is, in fact, pedestrian and unimaginative throughout. Con- sidering that Stock has sat at Pound's fireside it is surprising how little sense of the living man he conveys- less sense, I think, than we could get from a random collection of Pound's writings, and much less than we get from Patricia Hutchins' account of his life in London. It is not a mere absence of "vividness"; Pound's social thought during his years in Italy culminated in some spectacularly eccentric notions, perhaps amounting indeed to a loss of grasp on reality, but Stock gives no clue about what had gone on in Pound's mind or sensibility that might have led up to this. There is little idea anywhere in the book of Pound's thought (however one may evaluate itJ as an ongoing process inside a real human head. Stock records changes in opinion, but it remains for the reader to guess why one opinion should have been more acceptable to Pound than another. Is there really no pattern to be perceived in his life or thought? Stock can devote a quarter-page to a pointless account of how the Kenyon Reviewr for reasons unknown, did not print any work by Pound, but it apparently did not even occur to him to wonder, for example, how as late as the Thirties Pound could maintain a genial tolerance for Communist and other left-wing groups alongside his alleged Fascist sympathies. Part of the trouble is that Stock is too little in command of the tech- niques of writing to do justice to Pound's life. The only structural prin- ciple at work in the book is a flat-footed commitment to chronology, come what may, and the only departure from that principle is inept an inexplicable digression on Pound's use at different times of Richard St. Victor. The index simply throws up its hands at the fullness and variety of Pound's life; its capricious omissions bespeak an ideal much different from that of the main body of the book: L. Burton Hessler, Montgomery Butchart, "Col. Jackson," Alvin Langdon Coburn, and the Poets Club are among the names not recorded in the index, though they figure in the text and in Pound's life. Stock's use of published source material is typified by his account of Pound's public effect at Wabash College, which is taken over bodily from a memoir by Viola Wildman in the Wabash Re- view in a paraphrase so close as to demand the quotation marks it doesn't get, and, a few pages later, his paraphrase of Pound's letter to William Carlos Williams defending A Lume Spento in which Stock's reproduc- tion of the original terms is only a bar to understanding. The genuinely 902</page><page sequence="197">funny posturings of the Philadelphia book reviewers about Pound's early work Stock dutifully inserts according to the date they appeared, drawing no attention to their incongruity, making no contrapuntal use of their bland provinciality. In Stock's view a fact is exhausted of possibilities upon being stated. In his failure to isolate high points, his seeming inability to perceive pattern or drama, and his unreflective devotion to "fact," Stock creates a dull parody of Pound's ideogrammic method, which he so condescend- ingly disvalues in his critical remarks. In his chapter on Hulme and Orage, he quotes Pound's account of Hulme's reaction to a remark about Caval- canti, an account that had, in context, some significance however slight; in this book it lies on the page inert and inscrutable. No biographer who does this sort of thing needs to twit Pound about his epistemology. The book has good things in it. When Stock permits himself actually to describe certain aspects of Pound's mind, as at the beginning of the chapter on the poet's travels in 1911! his remarks seem true and enlighten- ing. But there is too little of this in the book. We still await an adequate biography of Ezra Pound. B Montgomery, Marion. EZRA POUND: A CRITICAL ESSAY. Contemporary Writers in Christian Perspective.

University of Missouri Press, 1969. 66 pp. $1.50 pb. Reviewed by FRANK BALDANZA, Bowling Green State University James Purdy is one of the most neglected of major novelists writing today. This may in part be due to his stance as a loner in the New York 904</page><page sequence="199">literary scene; it is also caused by certain difficulties facing the critic of his works. Each novel is remarkably different in form from the others, and the kinds of alienated, outsider's truths he conveys are not easy for middle-class readers to assimilate. He moves from Kafkan fables to mid- western realism, from satire to idyll with disarming ease; and the drab- ness of his style does little to enhance the reading. His characters fre- quently exist at an extreme of desperation, loneliness, and pain that has little parallel in the ordinary American self-image, and he is not interested in ameliorating the shock by romanticizing his down-and-outers in the manner of Algren or Kerouac, nor does he write with the bluster of Mailer or Jones. His refusal to compromise with commercial formulas or to settle into a familiar pattern will, ultimately, guarantee him a high place in our literature, but it currently withholds from him the kind of attention that is his due. Thus one is grateful for any notice of his work. Although rumor has it that the author himself is pleased with some of her criticism, Bettina Schwarzschild's little pamphlet may do him as much harm as good. It is a collection of short essays, some of which were previously published in journals, that cover in a very brief way all of his major works. If most critics could be classified by distinguishing between those who commit themselves absolutely to the polemical drives of the author as opposed to those who attempt to judge his work dispassionately and objectively, then Bettina Schwarzschild is decidedly in the former camp. The value of such commitment, especially early in the critical assessment of an author, is that the partisan critic, if he is close enough to the author's meaning, lays a sympathetic exegetical base for later, more detached evaluations. But by claiming too much too enthusiastically, the partisan critic may do more to alienate than to convince the lukewarm reader, especially when he maintains that the author has some unique grasp on the real, and that one must practically live out this view of reality as a prerequisite to understanding the author. There is a further implication that those who are constitutionally incapable of participation in this world-view are either spiritually dead or malicious; when things get this personal, rational judgment is impossible. Bettina Schwarzschild runs all the risks possible to this pattern of criticism. One looks in vain for the very slightest indication that Mr. Purdy has any mundane weaknesses at all. Every word he writes in every last book is assumed to be on the same high plane of exalted excellence. There is no indication that his talents are better suited to any one of the three genres (short story, play, novel) in which he works, nor that within the novel, he is better at fantasy or realism or satire. In short, Bettina Schwarzschild eschews nearly all purely literary judgment in favor of content analysis as polemics. She is at her best in the short introduction and in her handling of The Nephew, Cabot Wright Begins, and Eustace Chisholm and the Works, because she confronts her materials directly for their immediate emo- tional impact, even though she tends to concentrate, in dealing with the major novels, on one or two characters from each book, overlooking a great deal in the process. This habit might be excused by the shortness of the pamphlet, if that were the whole story. 905</page><page sequence="200">But at her worst, Bettina Schwarzschild lets loose with a flood of mythological-anth ropological-sociological-psychosexual preachifyi ng that simply uses the Purdy text the way a pastor uses a Bible verse. She begins with the conviction that modern society is sick and alienated because it has cut itself off from some primitive psychosexual family arrangement, and that the poet's openness to archetypes makes him a seer who can restore us to paths of righteousness. She uses a bizarre range of obscure etymologies, myths, initiation rites, castration cults, and archetypes to attempt to moralize about sexual dislocations of our times. While it would be difficult to "disprove" these assumptions individually, most of them, drawn from fields of expertise in the social sciences, are being evoked in an area where they cannot be examined for their validity in any disciplined way. One seriously doubts if the entire farrago of psychosexual-anthropological material would make much sense to a reputable scholar in those areas. It frequently sounds as if Bettina Schwarzschild uses a scatter-shot method-the more mythic analogues the better. One woman in a short story is successively a fairy princess, Jocasta, Persephone, and Aphrodite; for good measure, Bettina Schwarzs- child throws in Queen Isis, Lady Macbeth, Mona Lisa, and Mme. Girard (another Purdy character). But then she remarks several times that seem- ingly conflicting readings do not cancel each other out. I find them con- fusing and irresponsible. Bettina Schwarzschild's rhetorical mannerisms are calculatedly dramatic, but very soon the ejaculatory fragments and the frequent, erratic italiciz- ing simply get in the way. And her generous use of "we" and "our" and "us" does not always carry the reader along in the cozy, participatory way intended, especially when the statements involve some of her more extreme assumptions: "He has us identifying in our very bowels with all his characters victim and tyrant, corrupters and corrupted. We are every- one and everything from the beginning of time." I would find that exhausting. By failing to bring to bear on the novels any of the canons of literary judgment ordinarily applied to writers, this critic actively prevents our comparing Purdy's work to that of many other authors to whom he is clearly superior. We would have to accept his novels as impassioned amateur occultists who are convinced the world will end tomorrow un- less one vatic seer shouts the truth about natural childbirth and breast feeding or the evil consequences of the incest taboo in the desert of TV antennas. But then a critic who casts the writer as John the Baptist is only consistent in assuming the role herself. C Rosen, Gerald. James Purdy's World of Black Humor. Pennsylvania, 1969, Neil Leonard.

Reviewed by ROBERT HOGAN, University of De/aware Reading Frank Durham's little book on Elmer Rice was a somewhat weird experience, for the book has the same subject, the same organization, the same length, size and weight as a book by me published in 1965 by Southern Illinois University Press. About half-way through, I began to toy with the unnerving fantasy that my subconscious self had been re- writing my old stuff and pseudonymously bringing it out again. What was particularly unnerving about this conceit was the sobering evidence of a ghastly mental deterioration that had set in, and in just a scant three or four years. Of course, there were certain inevitable judgments that we still agreed on, such as the predominant excellence of The Adding Machine and Street Scene. But my now hideously debased taste seemed to think that The Subway, Between Two Worlds and Not for Children were bad plays. I had even degenerated into quoting and, worse, taking seriously the remarks of. the Broadway reviewers. I had, in lieu of ideas, fallen into the bad habit of plot summary. My prose style, of which I had once been rather vain, had now deteriorated into a sodden pudding of mulchy verbosity, dismally dotted with bloated cliches. I had omitted mention- ing the full checklist of Rice's works, which were far from being "count- less," and which I had once published in Modern Drama. In fact, I had even cast doubts on my original veracity in some parts of the bibliography I had retained. I was now not only churlish about my original work, but I had impertinently turned my original theme topsy-turvy. Where I had once seen Rice as being defeated by the commercial milieu of the Ameri- can stage, I now purported to see his career as "the Great American Success Story, the Horatio Alger rags-to-riches protagonist...."

EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON: THE LIFE OF POETRY. Pegasus, 1969.188 pp. $8.00 cloth, $1.95 pb. Franchere, Hoyt C. EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON. Twayne's United States Authors Series, No. 00. New York, 1968. 162 pp. $3.95. Reviewed by RICHARD CROWDER, Purdue University Professors Franchere and Coxe agree that Robinson was no run-of-the- mill man: Franchere calls him "rare . . . infinitely warm . . . gifted." Coxe dubs him "remarkable," "some kind of hero." For proof they each list between seventy and eighty of the 208 poems in the collected work, but concentrate on far fewer. The reader can hope that the selections are not slanted for the sake of argument, and I don't believe they are. Coxe's book could be called a continuation of an article in the Sewanee Review in 1954 and his Minnesota Pamphlet (1962). Though the pamphlet lifts whole passages of comment from the article, this book develops what necessarily had to be omitted in the shorter studies. For example, Coxe mentions the important "Eros Turannos" several times, but does not give it full treatment, explaining that he has done so "elsewhere." Franchere, following the purpose of the TUSAS books, often gives somewhat elementary summaries of his selections, drawing on Chard Powers Smith's theory (with gratifying moderation) that much of Robin- son's work is autobiographical based on a love triangle formed by E. A., his brother Herman, and Herman's wife, Emma. He makes frequent reference to Coxe's pamphlet, amending, differing, agreeing. His book was finished before he had access to Coxe's book. (Coxe does not mention Franchere's study.) Coxe reminds us repeatedly that Robinson was determined to follow "the life of poetry" and was finding the way arduous. Much more than Franchere, he invokes the names, lives, and works of Eliot, Stevens, and other fashionable writers. In fact, he devotes several pages to relating "The Man against the Sky" to "Sunday Morning" and "Little Gidding," explaining that, of course, the Robinson poem can never be judged the equal of the other two. Coxe is somewhat in the tradition of Yvor Win- ters, whose book on Robinson appeared in 1946. Franchere is more akin to Emery Neff (1948), inclined to praise what Winters found wanting. Both Coxe and Franchere, however, find more of interest in Amaranth (1934) than Winters, but they both follow him in condemning Talifer (1933). (Here I think they are all in error. The comic surface of this long poem, which follows the outline of the General Confession in The Book of Common Prayer, is deceptive to the unwary.) On the other hand, they fail to see eye to eye on Tristram. Coxe calls it the "least rewarding" of the three Arthurian poems, with the "least power of survival," whereas in Franchere's opinion it marked "the high point of Robinson's career." Coxe goes so far as to call it "meretricious." Franchere says it was "skillfully managed" and "thoroughly disciplined." Franchere departs from Neff in giving very little attention to "The Man against the Sky," except to note that the affirmations are atypical: it is the "doubts and fears," he says, that make their reappearances unre- 9o9</page><page sequence="204">solved in later works. Coxe comes closer to Neff in pointing to "fine Wagnerian moments, great eloquence/' and "epigrammatic Iyricism" with the "rhyme and meter" under strict control, though he agrees with Win- ters in saying that "Hillcrest," on a simiGar theme, is the better poem. Both these books give us new (and needed) explications of several poems. Coxe is good, for example, on "Hillcrest" and "Old Trails." Franchere looks hard and favorably on The Man Who Died Twice and Matthias at the Door. There are other analyses that a Robinson reader would find stimulating. Several distractions mar these books. Franchere insists on calling "Octaves" "The Octaves" and on spelling "Gard" as "Guard." Robinson wrote of his first book: "There is very little tinkling water, and . . . not a red-bellied robin...." Commenting on the Collected Poems, Franchere remarks (p. 25), "There are, to be sure, no red-bellied robins and no tinkling water...." On pp. 44-45 he modifies this statement to "One does not find much 'tinkling water' or many red-bellied robins In any- thing he wrote." Finally, on p. 84 he concedes that one finds in Merlin "the very words . . . tinkling water!t' Is Franchere afraid of being ridden by Emerson's "hobgoblin of little minds"? Further, he frequently uses the odd phrase "the Maine man" when referring to the poet, an epithet probably related to his feeling that Robinson was more influenced by Gardiner (Tilbury Town) than by New York (where Coxe puts his em- phasis). On some pages Franchere quotes passages to be found in Selected Letters (1939), but refers the reader only to the "Harvard Collection." Elsewhere he does acknowledge Se/ected Letters, with disconcerting in- consistency. The published book is patently more readily available than the Harvard Collection. He cites as source of the Crabbe sonnet, not the Col/ected Poems, but a Pennsylvania Ph.D. dissertation. In commenting on "Mr. Flood's Party," he refers inexplicably to the "precious remem- bering jug." It is Mr. Flood who remembers "that most things break." (Coxe gets this right.) In his book, Coxe spells "Killigrew" twice as "Killegrew." He has a penchant for the sesquipedalian: he uses "epigoni" twice, "locus classi- cuso' thrice, "periphrastic" five times, and "provenience" eight times ! (Whatever happened to the old reliables "origin" and "source"?) These bookish locutions are balanced by a generous sprinkling of "in" words equally disturbing: "mod," "pop," "Mum" (mother), "mixed bag," "I;ve a little," "wheeler-dealer," and other phrases that might make a professor a popular classroom lecturer. Coxe is sometimes drawn too easily into misleading generalizations. He writes of "the nit-picking psychologizing of the ten years between 1923 and 1933." On another page he admits that The Man Who Died Twice (1924) "has subdued power and a real relevance." Dionysus in Doubt (1925) contains some fine poems. He might have better placed the first year of his rather glib comment at 1927, since he doesn't express much interest in Tristram Several other easy, broad statements spot his chap- ters. He says twice that characters in Amaranth are reduced to a pile of dust. Actually, Watchman, the lady poetaster, is the only one who meets this fate. He includes "Mortmain't in a list of poems in which "the wife 910 </page><page sequence="205">or woman . . . endures the thoughtless disregard of a husband or lover... " In this poem Avenel is restrained by the memory of her brother, who, unless I am badly mistaken, has not been his sister's lover while he was alive. In listing three very good short poems, Coxe says they "would make any poet's reputation, and most get by on far less!" Surely "most" of the poets we continue to read have contributed more than three worthy poems to our literature. Coxe is unnecessarily arch at times: "The house of Macmillan thought enough of him to refuse Lancelot for publication." Again, he says that Robinson's benefactress Mrs. Davidge remarried "presumably." Coxe would do scholars a favor in revealing the provenience of his doubt. In spite of their lapses, however, both these books will be useful in enhancing our enjoyment of Robinson's work. They add nothing much to the biography; neither book is brilliant; both are now and then erratic. The cautious reader will nevertheless find profit in many of the expli- cations.

Reviewed by WlLLIAM J. MARTZ, Ripon College Despite the stylelessness of so much of today's academic writing, poured forth like careers, the American contribution to the field of humane letters is formidable, and nowhere, I think, is this more true than in the field of literary biography, now in something of a Renaissance period. As individuals we have our favorites. Two of mine would be Andrew Turnbull an Thomas Wolfe and Lawrance Thompson on Robert Frost. To these and others I would certainly add The Glass House. I would add it because I think it does what a biography has to do, get us to the man, make us feel through the facts of a life what a life can mean. Seager writes close to detail, and yet with a humane perspective, which seems to be one of the secrets of a good biography. Seager traces Roethke's life in fourteen chapters from birthplace to the last years, persistently attempting to understand the poet's psychic make- 911</page><page sequence="206">up and concluding with an appendix suggesting that Roethke's psychic disorder may have been a symptom of disintegration preceding reinte- gration of the personality at a higher level. In plainer terms, the fact of being a great poet may involve the necessity of a high psychic price with a return that would have to be called fair value for the meaning of a life. Is the suffering worth it? Yes, if the end of the suffering is a deeper sense of self and of the human spirit. It reminds one of the under- graduate course in Milton and the doctrine of purification by trial, and does indeed have a dull acadernic ring, except that Roethke's poetry is a fact of our history and is always ready to sound the difference between the abstractly dull and the concretely beautiful. To speak of Roethke is of necessity to speak of the academic world, for Roethke was not only a poet but a teacher, and an inspiring one. Seager sums up his excellent and difficult technique in a single sentence: "Al- though he prepared the subject of his class hour, he did not prepare his presentation." The best teachers know that this is surely among the best ways to teach, if not the best. Roethke, to his limitless credit, was not a poet using the university for egocentric and perhaps as a result even self-defeating ends. He was a man who knew the work of teaching, loved it, and was left exhausted by it. He showed his students, as Seager writes, "how poetry could help them define their own emotions," and Lewis Jones, a onetime president of Bennington College, comments, "and he was very good at teaching just plain English composition." As one who has heard many of his colleagues confess their incompetence to teach writing and use that as a rationale for dilution of a syllabus, I find Jones's simple remark touched with poetic beauty. But we must not wax sentimentalt for the very point of a hard look at a life is to avoid being sentimental and to see the depth and beauty of the real. Seager, it must be said, tends to cultivate a misleading and a stereotyped contrast between Roethke as poet-hero and the dirty misera- ble hypocritical academic world. An obvious example is the quotation and comment on a mean-spirited letter about Roethke in 1935 from someone at the University of Michigan who calls himself "Nym." A less obvious example is the comment in effect praising Roethke for his search- ing and fiendishly difficult examinatoins. But the comment, it seems to me, is too simple, since nothing is said about the really crucial issue of how the examinations were graded. In other wordst do not many of the teachers thought great by many undergraduates turn outt if one looks closely, to engage in all manner of impressive techniques designed, con- sciously or unconsciously, to hold the undergraduate in awe rather than to free his mind? Such techniques include impossible examinations and drinking beer with the students, which Roethke also did. I do not mean to imply that Roethke was not an excellent, even a great teacher. The testimony that he was is impressive and convincing. But I do mean to point to the biographer's responsibility to treat the various aspects of his subiect with reasonable thoroughness. Seager could have defended Roethke less and probed more, particularly in relation to the academic world. Of course it is obvious that Seager as novelist, as creative writer, had himself had a nosefull of the academic world. When he vents his spleen against it, it is as if the best of his humane perspective is turning on itself, destructively. 912</page><page sequence="207">The other weaknesses of the book are relatively minor and often moot. The opening chapters seem flat and not tightly relevant to the subject at hand, but are interesting as history. Seager writes fluently but also seems addicted to gratuitous comment, which may or may not bother a given reader. His chapter on Roethke's working methods could have given us priceless commentary about the poet but instead dissolves into a loosely organized presentation of a selection from Roethke's notebooks. One could have hoped for a more searching treatment of Roethke's marriage, but what there is seems sensitive and fair, and the difficulty of acquiring the facts cannot be gainsaid. In fact, any biography has to be read with an awareness that the facts about people are exceedingly difficult to come by and perhaps even more difficult to interpret. Allan Seager has written a biography that will stand. He wrote it in his last years, and it is a fine monument to a good man. It is also a fine monument to its subject, Theodore Roethke. Seager vivifies "the perma- nent floating muddle Ted lived in" and makes us see that it finally had form. And with the form went charm. Here for example is part of Ted's account of his father's preoccupation with fertilizer: ". . . the manure machine . . . was not just a contraption but a veritable Roman bath: about forty by twenty-five feet, with an assembly of pipes, faucets, steam-gauges, a cat-walk for the attending mixer of the brew, which was a special, I dare-say, scent formula such was the nature of the Roeth- kes' manure, lime, hot water, bonemeal, and God knows what else. Any- way, it grew roses." Multiply this, and of course its serious counterpart, by fourteen chapters and an appendix and the yield is, I think, the poetic beauty of biography.

JEAN-PAUL SARTRE A Bauer, George Howard, SARTRE AND THE ARTIST. University of Chicago Press, 1969. 200 pp. illus. $8.50. Reviewed by ALLEN BELKIND, University of Nevada In his Introduction to this beautifully bound book with a humorous caricature of Sartre by Calder on the cover and an interesting pencil sketch of him by Giacometti opposite the title page, Bauer points out that throughout his career, Sartre has been concerned with art and the artist, and that the purpose of his book is to examine Sartre's preoccu- pation in his novels, plays, and critical essays with sculpture and sculptors, painting and painters, and poetry and poets. Although Sartre has not published a fully elaborated and systematic study of his aesthetics, Bauer locates most of his basic ideas about art in certain of his early philosoph- ical and psychological works and in Qu'est-ce que la litterature? Bauer first relates Sartre's aesthetics to his ontological concepts concerning the difference between existence and being. Man exists, but constantly at- tempts to escape from the fluidity and meaninglessness of existence into the solidity of being (things). The art object provides another escape from the anguish of consciousness (nothingness) into the beautiful but unreal world of imaginary being. In his escape into the world of beauty, how- ever, the viewer must negate the real world. This act of negation, accord- ing to Sartre, separates the arts of painting, sculpture, and music all concerned with beauty from the literary art in which a writer engages in a moral commitment, deals with the real world, and uses words as signs to communicate his direct meaning to the reader. Sartre further distinguishes between the nature and function of poetry and prose. Although both arts use words, the poet conceives of words as things- materials comparable to stone, pigment, and notes -with which to create his own imaginary world, and does not "utilize" words as signs of com- munication. 915</page><page sequence="210">JEAN-PAUL SARTRE In his perceptive chapters on Sartre's literary works, Bauer delves further than most critics thus far into Sartre's use of art objects to pose the solidity and eternal order of being against the transient realities of existence. In La Nausee, the Khmer statuette, the "official portraits" in the Bouville museum (which become a device for Sartre to satirize the falsely idealized art that creates the myth of divine right of kings), the novels of Balzac and Stendahl, and the haunting jazz melody, all tempt Roquentin to escape from the "disagreeable warm viscosity" of his existence into an artificial world of unity and order; but finally these objects make him recognize that he cannot permanently transcend the gratuitousness and disorder of the human condition. In his brief chapter on Sartre's plays, Bauer focuses upon Les Mouches (The Flies) and Huis Clos (No Exit) to again pose character against art object, existence against being. The old women of Argos fearfully offer up libations to the bloody statue of Jupiter which preserves his power over the town; but Electra and Orestes see through both the false art of the statue and the weakness of Jupiter, the character. The violent murder of Aegisthus and Clytemnes- tra becomes their symbolic act of freedom from all false idols. Just as Jupiter is dependent upon his statue, so is Garcin of No Exit bound to his solidified life in Hell. When gazing at the Barbedienne bronze statue, Garcin realizes that the image of his earthly cowardice has now become frozen forever in Hell and resembles the frozen being of the statue. He can no longer succeed in changing his image from coward to hero in the eyes of Estelle and Ines. In Sartre's trilogy, Les Chemins de la liberte (Roads to Freedom), Bauer finds that the significance of the artist's role in Mathieu Delarue's life has been overlooked. Mathieu's intended search for, but actual escape from, freedom and "authentic existence"- and his unpleasant confrontations with various art objects in Paris remind him of this is contrasted unfavorably to the committed existence of the painter, Gomez, who has forsaken his creative work to fight in the Spanish Civil War. In the chapters concerned with Sartre's art criticism, Bauer points out that Sartre's prejudiced attitude toward most traditional forms of sculp- ture and painting has been based strongly upon his "desire to destroy the politico-religious myths" that these artists have helped perpetuate throughout history and their attempts to create the illusion of man as a fixed eternal being. To Sartre, most sculptors have attempted unsuccess- fully to suggest movement but have created only "a world of corpses." But Sartre has modified his views after having studied selected works of contemporary sculptors Calder, Hare, and Giacometti who have devel- oped new techniques to free their art from traditional forms and who have produced the kind of "existential" art that reflects Sartre's own philosophical attitudes. Enchanted by Calder's mobiles, created from tin, zinc, and iron, and which avoid anthropomorphism, Sartre found himself responding to a momentary event rather than a created object. In the non- representational works of David Hare, Sartre discovered a sculptor who could imaginatively shape the "privileged material" of bronze into am- biguously humorous "self-contained creatures in their own private worlds" that excluded the spectator. Sartre so admired Giacometti's fragile, elongated creatures that hauntingly suggest the transiency of the human 916</page><page sequence="211">flesh that he was instrumental in elevating the sculptor into existential sainthood. In his essays on painters, Sartre favors those whose works portray the human condition as a vital process and project toward the future "the anguish of becomingo' rather than the static permanence of being. Of the old masters, he prefers the distorted figures of Tintoretto over the more beautifully perfect ones of Titian and views Tintoretto as the workers' painter whose aesthetic values opposed the fixed standards of his time and who represents for Sartre the doubt and anguish of the Renaissance mind that could not accept or portray assured faith. He admires Gia- cometti's dynamic use of line to avoid defining the contours of his figures' bodies, the explosive Iyricism of Lapoujade's abstract paintings, and Masson's landscapes in the shape of human forms that lend to his mountains, rocks, and trees the vitality of human existence. He views Wols' life of self-destruction in the context of Gauguin's, as an artist who "sacrificed his flesh for his art" and whose ugly multifacited figures show the "wondrous horror" of the world. Sartre's controversial treatment of the poets, Baudelaire and Mallarme, is mainly negative because, to Sartre, they negated life in their attempted escape into the poetic world of being. Genet is seen by Sartre as a good prose writer who has attempted unsuccessfully to write poetry by con- fining his natural explosive energy in the rigidity of others' forms. He praises Ponge's use of "ambiguity, metamorphosis, and discontinuity" as helping create a more lifelike image of man, but is disappointed in his discovery of mineral images and other forms of non-life in his work. Sartre reserves his highest praise for the poets of French Africa who have overcome "the temptation of the myth of being" and have created, through the dynamic use of organic imagery (plants, sex), a revolutionary poetry. Finally, Sartre's rejection of the "official role" of the artist, ex- tends to the criticism of musique engagee sought by some Communist musicians, the kind of music Sartre sees as perpetuating "values given to the musician by the elite of the society." To Sartre, the great artist strives to transcend the iimits of any restricting society by creating new forms that embody his freedom. Bauer's book is an important contribution to Sartre scholarship be- cause it illuminates Sartre's concern about art in greater detail than others thus far. The illustrations of painting and sculpture inclLeded in the book help the reader view these art objects through Sartrets eyes and his own, but Bauer fails to include passages from the poetry that Sartre likes and dislikes. I also wish Bauer had extended his intention to criticize some of Sartrets biases and blind spots about art and literature. He does mention, however, that Sartre tends to exclude the kinds of art and the works of individual artists that do not fit either his prejudices or preferences. One could argue that litterature engagee does not insure its being good literature, just as much good literature is not litterature engagee in the narrow Sartrean sense; also that the poetry of the French symbolists, Baudelaire and Mallarme, who tend to use words analogously to music in an opaque and private manner, is not typical of most poetry. Sartre narrows the meaning of "communication" in separating literary prose from poetry and the other arts. He also tends to group Renaissance 917</page><page sequence="212">IEAN-PAUL SARTRE painters in such a way as to show a supposed similarity of intention (helping support the myth of divine authority) and neglects the differences in their styles and aesthetic intentions. Nevertheless, one must admire the consistent development of Sartre's aesthetic theories out of his basic philosophical ideas. Because of his acute insights and the scope and inw fluence of his ideas, Sartre remains one of the important thinkers of olJr time. Belkind, Allen.

THE THEATRE OF JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. Columbia University Press, 1969.196 pp. $7.50. Reviewed by HENRIETTE SEYFFER7, Indiana University Southeast The purpose of this study is to introduce the plays of Sartre to an English-speaking audience, and it does a very competent job. The book is well written, thoroughly researched, and it successfully meets the chal- lenge of presenting the moral and social implications of existentialism in a readily understandable language. To investigate the problems encountered by Sartre in giving shape to his views on modern drama, Mrs. McCall has grouped the plays accord- ing to themes ("Action as Salvation,'t Ch. 1, "Action as Damnation," Ch. IV) technique ("Action and Realism," Ch. 11), and genre ("Comic Interludes," Ch. 111). The confJict between theory and practice focuses on two points: the theatre as medium (requiring a delicate balance between word and act), and the essence of the Sartrean play (presenting the ccon- tradictions inherent in human situations). Some simplification was obviously necessary to cover all this material in 163 pages, and it is usually well done. I only regret that Mrs. McCall did not clarify some of the main criteria she uses. The Sartrean under- standing of such terms as morality, myth, realismt violence, and rhetoric is quite different from that of the average English-speaking person. The problein of cultural differences is also responsible for the fact that Mrs. McCall can discuss the plays in terms of the characters when she knows -theoretically-that Sartre insists on a theatre of situation where the psychological make-up of the characters is secondary to the demands of the moment. This misunderstanding is underlined by the unwarranted parallel drawn between Strindberg's and Sartre's use of characters. The only thing both have in common is that they want to redefine the con- cept of "character.'t Otherwise their definitions are poles apart: Strind- berg is fighting for a flully determined character; Sartre is fighting against it. This ambivalence at the outset of Mrs. McCall's study necessarily leads to a dual standard of evaluation. She has no difficulty appraising the more obviously existentialist plays No Exit and The Condemned of Altona on the basis of Sartrets concept of the theatre. Coming to the less theoretical 918</page><page sequence="213">dramast she again resorts to the traditional concepts of American criticism. Thus Dirty Hands is said to belong to the "realistic tradition," to deal "in a serious, nonmythical way with a contemporary crisis," to escape "Sartre's great fault of sterilizing his drama with rhetoric." Had Mrs. McCall followed her original intention of relying "extensively on Sartre's own writings, insc)far as they elucidate what he is doing in the theatre,/' she would not oppose "mythical" to "realistic" and "contemporary" or "rhetoric" to "passion." The fact that some of the plays will not yield to traditional character analysis complicates matters. Mrs. McCall solves the problem by Freudian interpretation. Having concentrated on the charac- ters in her study of The Flies and The Devil and the Good Lord, she appraises the merits of the play on the value of Goetz and Orestes as Sartrean alter egos which "recall the childhood fantasies Sartre describes in The Words. . . Unfortunately, the melodramatic heroics Sartre plays out in his two epic-scale plays lack the saving irony of The Words." Sartre had no intention of being ironic. Goetz' Germany was a mirror image of Sartre's France of 1945-1951, both countries being wrecked in the name of principles. Mrs. McCall did see the parallel between Argos and the France of 1943, but she failed to realize that there are no heroes in those plays (as the titles clearly indicate), just desperate people doing desperate things within the limits imposed upon them by their situation. This, too, has been stated by Sartre, for whom heroes are "optical illu- sions." He has even gone so far as to call "scum" those "vvho try to show that their existence is necessary." Yet Mrs. McCall suggests that Goetz and Orestes are "indispensable." These are the limits of the book. The author has taken her stand, and in so doing she succeeds where many writers fail: she challenges the reader, sends him to the sources, makes him think. I am looking forward to using her book in my classes. Sheridan, James F., Jr. SARTRE: THE RADICAL CONVERSION. Ohio University Press, 1969.168 pp. $7.50. Reviewed by WILLIAM V. SPANOS, State University of New York at Binghampton Ever since the publication of Critique de la Raison Dialectique in 1960, Jean-Paul Sartre has been persistently charged with betraying his early existentialism in favor of something perilously close to orthodox Marxism. This accusation has been given considerable authority in the English speaking world by such commentators as Wilfred Desan (The Marxism of Jean-Paul Sartre), Walter Odajnyk (Marxism and Existentialism), Anthony Manser (Sartre: A Philosophica1 Study), and especially Mary Warnock, who, in her book The Philosophy of Sartre (1965), sees Sartre's progress from Being and Nothingness (1943) to the Critique as a "radical conver- sion," which presents the "spectacle of the death of Sartrean existential- ism." Sheridan's book is a dynamic and sometimes brilliant philosoph- ical defense of Sartre against this common charge. 919</page><page sequence="214">JEAN-PAUL SARTRE According to Sheridan, Mrs. Warnock and others who make the charge read Sartre's early work from Nausea through Being and Nothingness in the light of the by now all too familiar idea that the human consciousness (/e pour soi) is radically free from the conditioning limits of the external and necessary world of objects (I'en soi). Assuming this rather simplistic polarization, it is then easy to conclude that Sartre's affirmation of a Marxist position in the Critique constitutes a rejection of the contingency of radical freedom in favor of the certainty of materialistic necessity. The view that Sartre presents a radically polarized world in his early work has its source, according to Sheridan, in the pervasive tendency to infer his philosophical position from his literary work and his popular lecture "Existentialism is a Humanism" (a point to which I will return). What Sheridan tries to show is that there is no real justification in Sartre's early work for the idea of polarization. For Sartre, from the beginning, conceived the freedom in his existentialism as the other face of necessity, that is, as something that exists only in relationship to a context, to "being-in-a-situation." The "conversion" to Marxism embodied in the Critique (and to which Sartre himself refers), therefore, is not a radical conversion but a shift in emphasis or, rather, a development. It is true, Sheridan observes, that the image of the "lonely, anguished, fiercely free individual" is central to the early work, especially the novels. But the overt emphasis on freedom should not obscure the implicit thereness of the limiting external world. Thus he reverses the usual procedure of investigation. In the first part of his book, besides pointing out Sartre's early interest in Marxist socialism in his essay "Materialism and Revolution" (written in 1946, at about the same time as "Existentialism is a Humanism"), Sheridan concentrates on this implicit presence of the limiting situation in his discussion of "Existen- tialism is a Humanism" and Being and Nothingness. And in the second and main part, where he examines the Critique, he concentrates on revealing the contingency and freedom that Sartre has by this time sub- ordinated to the dimensions of necessity and order but not denied. There is no space here to present Sheridan's difficult but always interesting defense. All that can be said is that he develops his argument primarily by analyzing "the keystone of Sartre's Marxism," the dialectical reason (which, unlike analytical reason, is a living reason that reconciles contingency and necessity, individual and collective, rather than eliminat- ing the particular in favor of the more easily graspable general) and related themes such as individual praxis (man as dialectical actor) and its counter- part, reciprocite (the intersubjectivity that praxis reveals). Then he pro- ceeds to amplify the contingency/necessity paradox in terms of the analogy of chess, which he distinguishes from the game theory in vogue among Anglo-American philosophers. I feel a little uneasy about Sheridan's use of the analogy of chess, and would have wished that his field of reference were wider than it is. (He cites only a few Anglo-American philosophers and of these only Miss Warnock beyond the name.) Fur- ther, I feel that his argument is at times extremely labored, occasionally to the point where the commentary is more difficult than Sartre's prose. But Sheridan's defense is often brilliant and in the end extremely per- suasive. Not only does his articulate analysis illuminate the central para- 920 </page><page sequence="215">dox of Sartre's Critique, that "being is contingently necessary and neces- sarily contingent,'' it also disintegrates the too simple view that Sartre's early existentialism was radically subjective and that the Critique repre- sents a "radical conversion." Sheridan's book is philosophyt not literary criticism, but his important assertion that the early Sartre's alleged subjectivism derived from his literary work warrants discussion of the implications of his thesis for the study of Sartre's novels and plays. According to the prevailing, virtually axiomatic, view of the English speaking literary community, the existential freedom of the protagonists of Sartre's fiction and drama ultimately manifests itself in an inescapable, indeed, welcomed solipsistic predica- ment, that is, a predicament that precludes relationship with others. Thus, for example, in "The Sublime and the Beautiful Revisitedt' (Yale Review, XLIX, 1959), a discussion of the post-modern literary imagination, Iris Murdoch (who gave this view a decisive authority in Sartre: Romantic Rationalist [1953]) can exclude Sartre from the other-directed post-mod- ernist avant garde and relegate him to the old subjectivist modernism of the Symbolist tradition on the grounds that his "Totalitarian Man" is incapable of tolerating to say nothing of living with the "messiness" of contingency, that is, other human beings: "This man on the one hand mistrusts his inner life and finds it insubstantial.... On the other hand, he dramatizes his situation in a myth. He is Hegel's man, who is a clear- cut piece of drama rather than an individual. He is also Hegel's man who abhors the contingent or accidental. (La Nausee, horror of the contingent.) According to Sartre, a desire for our lives to have the form and clarity of something necessary, and not accidental, is a fundamental human urge. In the world inhabited by Totalitarian Man there are other people, but they are not real contingent separate other people. They appear as organi2ed menacing extensions of the consciousness of the subject. A ,sotentially or apparently separate center of significance is neces- sarily a menace to a Hegelian, something to be internalized in a battle of consciousnesses just as discrepant centers in oneself are over- come by reflection.t' (For a more recent version of this interpretation of the Sartrean man, see Richard Wasson. "Notes on a New Sensibility," Partisan Review, vol. XXX, 3, 1969). if, on the other hand, we are per- suaded by Sheridan's argument that from the beginning Sartre con- ceived contingency and necessity as reciprocally related rather than exclusive categories, we are driven to reexamine the early literature (especially the paradigmatic "philosophical" novel, Nausea, from which Sartre/s philosophical and literary critics derive the view that his existen- tialism is a deeply pessimistic or arrogant-solipsism.) What we might find by focusing on the external restrictions upon freedom, that ist the situation, in Nausea, The Ways of Freedom, The Flies, No Exit (as Sheridan does on "the coefficient of adversity of things" in the early "Existentialism is a Humanism" and Being and Nothingness) is that they are, in fact, works of literature, rather than philosophy. We might find, that is, that the conclusions (or, as in the case of The Ways of Freedom, the lack of a conclusion) are ironic revelations of failure rather than direct embodiments of ideological fulfillment. To be more specific, we are likely to discover in Nausea, for example, that, far from 921 </page><page sequence="216">being the paradigm of the Sartrean hero that he is for Miss Murdoch and the others like Wasson who follow her, Roquentin is, in fact, no hero at all. For the decision of this frequenter of clean, well-lighted places to make his life the equivalent of non-existent circles through the Wor- ringean-Hulmean cubistic novel he intends to write may not be, as the clear allusion to the essentialist Plato of the Philebus suggests, a fulfill- ment of the existential consciousness, but a failure of nerve at the moment when the situation reveals that freedom demands relationship with the terrible but richly potential world of other people. This need to reexamine the early Sartre is an important one. For if, as I think Miss Murdoch (and Mr. Wasson) are right in saying, the post- modern sensibility (as opposed to that of the Symbolistes and their heirs) is characterized above all by the affirmation of the "messiness" of exist- ence, the willingness, that is, to risk one's freedom for the sake of achieving relationship with others, then the Sartre discovered by Sheridan in his study of the Critique comes to be seen not only as one of the pioneers of the new sensibility, but also as one of its abiding explorers.

KAYEo Brook/yn College Some critics have scoffed at the Joyce industry, but Joyce's fiction is so difficult and elaborately allusive that almost any study will be at least useful. Shaw, on the other hand, is distinguished by lucidity and clarity. Moreover, he has explicated his plays in prefaces, detailed stage-direc- tions, and long letters to actors, actresses, directors, and producers as well as by equally long epistles to biographers, scholars, critics, and friends; and there is a very large corpus of Shaw criticism, some of it first-ratet extending from the nineties to the present. Every scholar ought to con- sider carefully whether he has a great deal to say which is fresh and important before he decides to write a book about Shaw. Although John A. Mills's Language and Laughter and Louis Crompton's Shaw the Dramatist have considerable meritst I think that only Charles A. Carpen- ter's Bernard Shaw &amp; the Art of Destroying Ideals can be justified as a book-length study of Shaw written for specialists. 923</page><page sequence="218">GEORGE BERNARD SHAW Crompton sees his work as "a general introduction to Shavian drama," which "would be of interest both to the literate layman and to the specialist," but of all three books his demands the most specialized knowledge, not only of Shaw but of Shaw criticism. Moreover, the new material which he uses- the manuscripts of plays and unpublished essays and letters is of interest principally to scholars. His method is to discuss the themes and characters of eleven plays, with much refutation of earlier critics. Each play is presented in a separate chapter in chronological order from Arms and the Man to Saint Joan. The problem posed by a method that makes it difficult to avoid monotony is complicated by the author's principled refusal to discuss the form of the plays. He sees his study as "an effort to break with the formalism that has dominated the academies for the last generation" and asserts that "Most training in literary tradition is in fact a positive impediment in understanding Shaw." Shaw the Dramatist is enlivened by Crompton's enthusiasm for his subject and sustained by knowledge garnered through years of study. Its greatest rewards are bits of information (I found the footnotes often very interesting) about manuscripts, writers who influenced Shaw, and the relationships of groups of plays; and it seems therefore particularly un- fortunate that there is no index. John A. Mills's book deals with the style of Shaw's dramatic prose. Writing from the neo-Aristotelian position of the Chicago school, he acknowledges the particular influence of Elder Olson. Not surprisingly, he emphasizes structure rather than words: ". . . the words of a play produce most of their effects, not directly, as words, but indirectly, as the means of our coming to know the plot; most of the power of a play comes not from the words themselves but from what it is that they disclose." With admirable candor and clear-sightedness, Mills applies this dictum to his own work: ". . . it should be clear that the primary source of comic power in Shaw's plays is the thought exhibited by the characters in them.... Hence in identifying and evaluating the ways in which Shaw uses words for comic effectiveness, we shall necessarily be dealing with devices of relatively little weight, measured against other comic elements at work in the plays." But what is there then for Mills to do? His subject is limited to Shaw's artistic resources in his "subtle strokes which supplement and enhance the effects of the more obvious beauties." He shows excellent judgment in presenting his material in a series of chapters on dialect, linguistic satire, automatism and word-play, and, finally, the neutral voice, butt unavoidably, the conclusions and even the illustrative material are predict- able. For example, the conclusions of the final chapter and the book- are that"Shaw's major characters exhibit either no linguistic aberrance at all or only so much as will not obviate a subsequent change to more acceptable patterns of behavior" and that Shaw's dramatic prose favors the plain stylc something close to the speech of reasonably literate people, often heightened by antithesis and anaphora. All of this would make pleasant reading for a long article or a few short ones, but is it enough for a book? Charles A. Carpenter's Bernard Shaw &amp; the Art of Destroying Ideals is an indispensable book for Shavians. Carpenter makes a complete study 924</page><page sequence="219">of Shaw's first three series of plays: Unpleasant Plays (Widowers Houses, The Philanderer, and Mrs. Warren's Profession), Pleasant Plays (Arms and the Man, Candida, The Man of Destiny which he places with Shaw's next series and You Never Can Tel/), and Three Plays for Puritans (The Devil's Disciple, Caesar and Cleopatra, and Captain Brassbound's Conver- sion). Starting from Martin Meisel's position (in Shaw and the Nineteenth- Century Theater) that Shaw's plays are based on familiar nineteenth- century dramatic genres, Carpenter observes that they are "strategic re- moldings," "artistic means to ethical ends" e.g., "to destroy ideals, to cultivate the intellect and to implant ideas." In each of the three series of plays the aim takes a different form and there is consequently a dif- ference in strategy. The Unpleasant Plays are called "propaganda plays," the Pleasant P/ays "critical comedies," and the Three Plays for Puritans (plus The Man of Destiny) "humanizations of heroic types of drama." In the propaganda plays, Shaw's strategy is to mislead his audience into blaming a particular villain, like Sartorius or Mrs. Warren, for a social evil; then, by "convicting" the audience of a "falsely mean judg- ment," he suggests that it is not evil men but society that is to blame and that it is up to the audience to change society or to resign itself to the unpleasant ending of the play. "The chief method of his [Shaw's] critical comedies is to make his characters seem ridiculous when they act according to ideals and sympa- thetic when they behave naturally. The resulting 'conflict of unsettled ideals' . . . is eminently appropriate to the strategy of ideal-destroying through pleasant effects...." Because Shaw does not attack departures from established norms of conduct but rather the norms of conduct -or ideals-themselves, he does not attack his ideal-ridden characters; instead he combines sympathy for them "with ridicule of their ideals, thus isolat- ing his real targets and avoiding waste." In the "humanizations of heroic types of drama," Shaw's strategy is to humanize the various kinds of melodramatic plays popular in the nineties by "undermining their idealistic notions of motivation" revenge (called the desire for justice), patriotism, romantic love, gentility. Instead, his characters are motivated for good or ill by the distinctive individual human will (thus these plays are called P/ays for Puritans). After defining the basic strategy for each series of plays, Carpenter shows how Shaw remolds contemporary dramatic genres to effect his strategy. For example, Arms and the Man is an "antiromantic" romantic comedy and You Never Can Tel/ is a "humanization" of the farcical comedy of manners, of which Wilde was the principal practioner during the nineties. But this is merely a beginning for a searching analysis of the relationship of dramatic technique to character and theme. Indeed, one feels that after Carpenter there is very little more to be said about Shaw's early plays. He is comprehensive and accurate, he marshalls his arguments well, his taste and judgment are excellent, and he speaks with authority about Shaw. After reading Bernard Shaw &amp; the Art of Destroying Ideals, I am convinced that it indicates the direction that Shaw scholar- ship should take and that the middle and late plays need the same kind of systematic study of the relationship of "artistic means to ethical ends." 925</page><page sequence="220">Dietrich, R. F. PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG SUPERMAN: A STUDY OF SHAW'S NOVELS. University of Florida Press, 1969. 198 pp. $7.50. Reviewed by ROBERT HOGAN, University of Delaware In his study of Bernard Shaw's extraordinary novels, R. F. Dietrich primarily intends to show that they reveal stages in Shaw's growth to maturity, and secondarily to prove that they are notable works of art. He is, in his main purpose, entirely successful, and the bulk of his book is illuminating, penetrating, wise and valuable. To simplify, his conclusion is that the five novels show in turn the unformed and imma- ture genius, then "the shaping of genius through the stages of intellectual development, emotional development, and the synthesis of mind and body, concluding with the birth of a relatively complete human being recorded in the final novel." His conclusion as well as his close sup- porting analyses strike me as a very considerable accomplishment, in- formed, impressive and irrefutable; and I have but two quibbles. First, the main section is weakened by plot summary. Mr. Dietrich's reason is, of course, that the novels are unfamiliar to most informed familiar with his subject. There is currently an insidious view that all criticism must be in some sense introductory, as if it were written for readers, but it seems to me that his public is necessarily, if unfortunately, a small handful of Shavophiles and critics, all of whom are perfectly the graduate student who must know something about everything, even though he does not have time to know all of the things at first hand. Second, and very minor, Mr. Dietrich notes that Agatha of An Unsocial Socialist, in describing a novel to Trefusis, remarks, "This is orve of your clever novels. I wish the characters would not talk so much." It is errone- ous, I think, to conclude with Dietrich that the "your" applies personally to Trefusis, and that Trefusis has actually written novels. Indeed, as Trefusis' concluding letter to Bernard Shaw indicates, writing novels would have been quite out of character. About Dietrich's secondary purpose, I am less happy. His strategy is to prove that Shaw's first novel, Immaturity, is innocent of the usual charges against it, and that therefore the later novels must be also innocent of the same charges. Well and good. However, he also asserts, with dazzling eccentricity, that Immaturity is far and away Shaw's best novel. His arguments are persuasive, cogent and full, but he might just as well have exercised all of this ingenuity to prove that the world is flat, or that Amanda McKittrick Ros is a genius. It just won't wash. Nevertheless, this engaging madness does not in the least harm the bulk of this excellent book or its major thesis. After all, the entirety of G. K. Chesterton's most brilliant piece of criticism insanely bore no rela- tion whatsoever to Bernard Shaw except, for come obscure reason, his name as its title. And for my part, I would much prefer to read Dietrich's superb, and quite occasional, lunacy, than the tedious good sense of any number of duller chaps. Huggett, Richard. THE TRUTH ABOUT PYGMALION.

Crosscurrents / Modern Critiques. Southern Illinois U n iversi ty Press, 1 969.178 pp. $4.95 . Reviewed by SIDNEY ADLER, Moorpark College, Moorpark, California In her Introduction, Marcia Allentuck states that this book of essays appears "at a moment when the study of Singer is not yet 'an industry,' when he comes to us undiluted by critics' excessive hunting after sources, parallels and other devices . . ." The truth of this assertion makes this anthology valuable, not only for its comprehensive, insightful explications of Singer's major works, but also because its contributors raise those questions about his work which, because of their relevancy, are hope- full conducive to further studies of Singer's growing canon. In his essay "Isaac Bashevis Singer and the Classical Yiddish Tradition," Eli Katz examines the premises of traditional Yiddish literature in order to explain Singer's "deviation" and modernity. Unlike the classical Yiddish writers whose fiction reflected deep concern for social justice and a com- mitment to community integrity, Singer is essentially concerned with the struggle between good and evil in man's soul. However, Katz' generali- zation that Singer's shtetl is merely "a stylized exotic backdrop" and a "viewing device" for man's struggle between good and evil is only partly true. Surely the protagonists of The Magician of Lublin and The Family Moskat must measure their own despair against the religious prohibitions which help to define the "evils" that confront them. Morris Golden ("Dr. Fischelson's Miracle") demonstrates how Singer uses marriage to represent symbolically the fusion of chaos and order. He also examines the operation of archetypal experience in Singer's novels and shows how Singer uses allegory. A particularly perceptive study of The Brothers Askenazi and The Fami/y Moskat by Max F. Schulz shows how both Singer brothers manipulate structure to render the mythic patterns and themes that extend the meanings of their respective works. Schulz explains how Singer uses mirror metaphor to trace the appearance-reality motif. Among the other essays is a penetrating look at The Magician of Lublin in which Cyrena N. Pondrom t"Conjuring Reality") elicits the mythic, moral and metaphysical worlds of Yasha Mazur (who "reenacts the historical myth of a chosen people who repeatedly turn away from God at the cost of terrible suffering") and a probing analysis of Satan in Goray in which Edwin Gittleman ("Singer's Apocalyptic Town: Satan in Goray") places Singer in the tradition of Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville because of his concern with corruption and salvation. Also valuable is Maximillian E. Novak's study of the grotesque in Singer ("Moral Gro- tesque and Decorative Grotesque in Singer's Fiction"), which reminds us that Singer uses the grotesque not to promote mere horror, but to sug- gest man's "fallen, sinful world." Although Singer's fiction evokes images of the Eastern European shtetl, now a relic of history, the contributors to this valuable anthology leave 928</page><page sequence="223">little doubt that the master's art is firmly rooted in the strategies of modern literature. Malin, Irving, ed. CRITICAL VIEWS OF ISAAC BASHEVIS SINGER. New York University Press, 1969. 268 pp. $8.00. Reviewed by IRVING BUCHEN, Fairleigh Dickinson University Isaac Bashevis Singer posits imbalance as the normal tilt of reality, caricature as the familiar face of man, and history as the trump card of Satan. But none of these askewed "norms" is discoverable apart from an understanding of Singer's straddling of literary traditions. Singer is a modern throwback, a conservative sensationalist, a Jewish gothicist. To situate Singer exclusively in the Yiddish literary tradition is to cut him off from his many rich connections, open and buried, with other signifi- cant modernists. To disregard or minimize his Jewish roots is to make him too patly universal and to undercut his complicated journey to typicality through the special and even unique. One example will suffice. Singer shares with Sir Walter Scott, Tennyson, Browning, the Pre- Raphaelites, Freud, Proust, Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor and Nabokov a "passion for the past." But the past is a panderer; it arranges all sorts of diverse unions. Typically, it ties the last century and this one together in their common concern with origins, with Freud providing both the pivot of summation and redirection. But that generalization is as far as one can meaningfully go. The special even peculiar reasons for the preoccupation then demand attention. For Tennyson the past was a means of softening and surrounding death; for Browning of testing the ring of objective truth; for Faulkner and O'Connor of shaping a manageable gothic geography; for Nabokov of enclosing the nymphets of paradise. It is the second half of the partnership with the past that concentrates an author's uniqueness. With Singer, the past is a nexus through which modern multiplicity encounters Jewish monotheism, and the new and the topical confront the old and the eternal. The past is personalized in the form of Singer's own Hasidic father and rational mother through whom he meets the eternal Jacob and Rachel. Moreover, because whatever is ephemeral, partial or false will not bear the strain of artistic reincarnation, the test of time is simultaneously the test of art. When Singer's works survive both tests, they attain the novelty and durability of biblical tales or talmudic parables. Applying the standard of unique typicality to this collection of criti- cal essays, edited by Irving Malin, I find the sampling biased on the side of typicality. Of the fourteen essays, of which eight are reprints, only five attempt to deal with Singer's special Jewish content. The first by Ruth Whitman is a four page, often sentimental account of her working as a translator with Singer. It is a piece more devotional than analytical, and one yearns for specifics. Was Singer satisfied with "glutton" for "fresser" with "school" for "cheder"? What changes did he make under the pressure of translation? Such questions remain unanswered. Irving Howe, in a reprinted essay, does deal with Singer's Yiddish style and with some 929</page><page sequence="224">of the problems of translation, but Howe is baffled by Singer's meanings. I might add that if there is such a thing as a Jewish literary critic, he is one who constantly worries what readers think. In fact, proportionately Howe spends more time examining the responses of readers than he does examining Singer. In contrast, Max F. Schulz sets Singer against the back- drop of Jewish-American fiction and with that collective Jewish pressure informing his analysis, makes Singer less baffling. Specifically, Schulz finds a recurrent situation which can best be described as a door which leads neither outside nor inside but into a closet. The Singer hero, typically called Jacob, in the very act of preserving his Jewish identity comes upon the maximum threats to that identity. In Singer's world, at least, much knowledge is a dangerous thing. The essay, "History in 1. B. Singer's Novels," especially written by Jules Chametzky for this volume, does not really deal with the Jewish concept of history or with Singer's related concept of God as an artist. From the Jewish point of view, history is the extension of the Old Testament and thus the covenant in continuum. The Bible is God's inc:arnation, history is man's. What draws Singer to God, however, is that He, like the mortal artist, is still creating. Satan is static and he is still using the old arguments; he is the eternal critic of God's artistry. Aside from failing to reflect these specific Jewish concepts in Singer's art, Chametzky is also unresponsive to Singer's agonizing over the numerous triumphs of evil in history. Chametzky atthe end of his essay quotes Francis Bacon: "Histories make men wise." A recent short story by Singer concludes with a less glib epigram: "The wicked make history." The final essay that stresses Singer's Jewishness is that by Samuel 1. Mintz. In "Spinoza and Spinozism in Singer's Shorter Fiction," Mintz rapidly goes to the heart of the matter: "Spinoza is a metaphor for the problem that has beset Yiddish literature . . . namely, the problem of the writer who dwells simultaneously in the opposing cultures of Jewish enlightenment or the Haskalah and the Jewish tradition." That perfectly stakes out the special and yet typical situation of Singer. It preserves the distinctly Jewish point of view and yet nicely accommodates the situation of the outsider which goes beyond Jewish confines. Of the remaining nine essays (two are reprints of interviews with Singer) that deal with Singer's more general literary than special Jewish connections, three deserve special mention. Michael Fixler's "The Re- deemers: Themes in the Fiction of Isaac Bashevis Singer" was the first and still is one of the best examinations of Singer's techniques in the short story, especially his use of narrators. Indeed, Fixler's analysis of Singer's good and inept narrators still holds true for his latest collection of short stories, The Seance. I found in Baruch Hochman's presentation of good and evil a more profound examination of the way in which the human and sexual wills in Singer tend to be aligned: "desire and its renunciation exist in intimate relation with each other, . . . desire itself leads man toward a highly ascetic renunciation of the world and the flesh." These are crucial insights and as far as I know originate with Hochman. Finally, Melvin J. Friedman finds a revealing tripartate structural pattern operative in at least three of Singer's novels. That pattern, which runs from trans- plantation to prophecy to return, is given further reverberations by a 930</page><page sequence="225">suggestive reading of the same structural pattern present in I lerman Hesse and Flannery O'Connor. The volume contains only a few errors or lapses. Malin speaks of slaughter as being sanctified in the Torah; he means ritual slaughter which redeems the eating of flesh. In an interview, Singer cXaims that he read Crime and Punishment when he was eleven; in In My Father's Court his precocity was backed up to the age of ten. Hochman wrongly has Satan in Goray first appearing in translation in 1956; it appeared in 1955. The bibliography by Jackson R. Bryer and Paul E. Rockwell is the most complete in print to date, although by limiting themselves to all the works in English, Bryer and Rockwell may not be providing the kind of chronological guidance future critics need. For example, Satan in Goray is listed as appearing in 1955, five years after The Family Moskat (1950). Actually, Satan in Goray was composed in 1933 and published in serial form in Yiddish in Globus in 1934. Similarly, "Two Corpses Go Dancing," which Bryer and Rockwell first list as appearing in Commentary in August, 1965, actually goes back to 1943 when it appeared in Yiddish with two other stories. I found much to argue with in Malin's collection but I am pretty much set in my views of Singer and the altercations are all to the good, for all of us. Besides, from the Jewish point of view, each man is a prisoner of his uniqueness. As Gershom Scholem puts it in his On the Kabbalah and Its Mysticism: Every word of the Torah has six hundred thousand "faces," that is, layers of meanings or entrances, one for each of the children of Israel who stood at the foot of Mount Sinai. Each face is turned toward only one of them; he alone can see it and decipher it. Each man has his own access to revelation. EDITH SITWELL C Bennett, Gordon Willard.

THE NOVELS OF AUGUST STRINDBERG: A STUDY IN THEME AND STRUCTURE. University of California Press, 1969. $7.95. Reviewed by EVERT SPRINCHORN, Vassar College Outside Sweden, Strindberg the dramatist has completely eclipsed Strind- berg the novelist. In a way, this is as it should be, for Strindberg's strength as a novelist lies mainly in his prose style, a style that is muscular, flexible, allusive, colloquial, and unyielding to translators. Constantly surging forward, it frequently crests into poetry, subsiding only to soar again, to spume and break. Pages that seem incomprehensibly dull in English are often gleaming gems in the original. For instancc . . . the girls' red garters, the yellow military braids of the boys, the blue bathing costumes of the summer guests; pilot cloth and Manchester cotton and baize, wool and jute, specimens of many fashions and wardrobes, of the poor as well as the rich. This passage from By the Open Sea reads like one of those lists in the Ithaca chapter of Ulysses, words, mere words, furrowing the page. But when we turn to the Swedish, the plowhorse turns into Pegasus. Dar fanns flickornas roda strumpeband, bevaringsgossarnes gula galoner, sommargasternas blaa simbyxor, doffel och korderoj, bomull och boy, ylle och jute, fraan alla moder och garderober, fattigmans och rikemans. What Strindberg's novels lack primarily is a firm structure. His archi- tectural strength was reserved for his plays, as if he needed to indulge himself with the looser form of the novel in order to prepare himself periodically for the discipline of the drama. The French critic Jolivet has arranged Strindberg's works in three concentric circles, with the polemic pieces and the literary criticism on the periphery, and the autobiographi- cal works forming a transition between the outer circle and the middle circle that comprises the novels. "Only in the plays, the center of his production, is reality truly unveiled and reduced to its essentials." This is the usual view, and Johannesson in his study of the novels, the first book in English devoted to the non-dramatic works of Strindberg, is not in- terested in contravening it. Instead he seeks to examine the novels on their own without comparing them to the dramas. Since the novels contain more of the actual stuff of Strindberg's life, it is easier to trace in 935</page><page sequence="230">them the thread of Strindberg's spiritual development and to read them as works of self-exploration. This is Johannesson's approach, and he is well aware of its limitations. For example, The People of Hemso (1887), Strindberg's most popular novel, and most shapely, does not fit into this scheme at all. But most of the other novels do. In treating them Johannesson relies heavily on Jung, at least for a vocabulary, and sees in Strindberg's career as a novelist the gradual abandonment of a persona or public self and its exchange for a "multi- tude of selves." Personality and self-consciousness, which are basic ele- ments in the early novels such as The Red Room (1879) and The Son of a Servant (1886-7) with their emphasis on society and the hero's place in it, yield in the 1890s, when Strindberg went through a severe mental crisis known as his Inferno, to self-liberation and a desire to '@immerse himself in a variety of points of view." @'After the Inferno period," says Johannesson, "it is art that matters, not personality." Dreams and fantasiest which to the naturalist Strindberg represented escape from the real world, become avenues to self-knowl- edge, and art becomes "a means of self-integrationt a process whereby inner tensions and conflicts are objectified and reconciled, and past experiences are integrated into a meaningful synthesis." Johannesson's best pages are devoted to the post-lnferno works, and his book, like Strindberg's career, reaches a climax with the autobiographi- cal novel (Inferno [1897]) Elsewhere I have called this the first twentieth- century novel, and Johannesson confirms me in my opinion. To most readers it is like Nijinsky's drawings, the scrawls of a madman. To those who know their Strindberg it is a fascinating art-work in which the author presents in a thoroughly original way what Johannesson calls the need to make a choice between a meaningless and a meaningful universe. "The hero's dilemma arises from the fact that the point of view that seems to provide meaning carries the implication of guilt, while the point of view that issues in meaninglessness carries the implication of innocence." More than self-exploration is involved here, and Strindberg's usual difficulty in providing a firm resolution to his novels works to his advantage in this instance. In dealing with the last novels, really novelettes, The Roofing Feast and The Scapegoat (both 1907), in which the increasingly subjective Strind- berg has come to rely on the monologue as his chief means of expression, Johannesson finds that compassion and resignation have taken the place of indignation and revolt. This rounds off his study in a way that is both psychologically and esthetically satisfying. However, as one turns the last pages of the book, one remembers that in actuality Strindberg did not end his life as a Prospero. The youthful hothead became a white-haired Jeremiah, raging at society. Indignation and revolt characterize the sixty- year old eminence as much as the adolescent rebel. Strindberg died in the midst of a national controversy, provoked by himself, which sharply divided his countrymen into pro and anti-Strindbergians, whom time was to reveal as, respectively, liberals and fascists. Non-Swedes tend to regard Strindberg as an eccentric hermit, but, though shy and retiring, he was always a public figure in Sweden in much the same way that Shaw was in England. 936</page><page sequence="231">Johannesson's thesis is not of course invalidated by his choosing to ignore the public Strindberg. However, by confining himself pretty much to Strindberg's search for inner harmony, he fails to tell us a great deal about the place the novels occupy in Strindberg's oeuvre and, for that matter, in the history of the nineteenth-century novel. Though Johannes- son's approach has the virtue of seldom leading the reader afield, I would have liked to learn more about the connections between the novels and the plays, since they often stand to one another as a prelimi- nary sketch does to a finished painting. This is especially true of the novel A Madman's Defense and the plays Miss Julie and Creditors. Even more interesting for the light it sheds on the methods of creative genius is the material relevant to the Inferno period: the confessional letters to Hed- lund, the condensation of these in the diary-like Inferno, and the final distillation in the play To Damascus. We are gradually getting away from the idea of Strindberg the way- ward genius, as unruly as his rumpled hair. We are coming to realize that he was a careful artist who did much of his work in public, selling his sketches as he worked his way toward an unconscious goal. What we need now are more studies of Strindberg's craftsmanship of the sort that Johannesson gives us in his analysis of the color symbolism in the short novel A Witch (1890). I suspect that Inferno and To Damascus will eventually be revealed as far less personal and subjective works than commonly supposed, with much more faddism than madness in them. The fact that Johannesson treats the autobiographical works primarily as novels is a step in the right direction. It is because Johannesson's book, gracefully written and factually reliable (of how much Strindberg criticism by non-Swedes can one say that?), opens up new areas for investigation that it will surely be regarded as a landmark of Strindberg criticism. What it leaves out other scholars will have to supply. His Jungian approach will doubtlessly be challenged by the Freudians; his psychological emphasis, by the historical and auto- biographical critics. Far from being definitive, Johannesson's study is suggestive and provocative, and nowadays that is high praise. "The mark of all that is good and beautiful is that it is not complete in itself but that it contains the germs of something more nearly perfect." Ibsen wrote that, but for once Strindberg would have agreed with him completely. JESSE STUART C LeMaster, Jimmie Ray. Jesse Stuart: Kentucky's Chronicler-Poet. Bowling Green, 1970, Frederick Eckman.

DYLAN THOMAS' EARLY PROSE: A STUDY IN CREATIVE MYTHOLOGY. Critical Essays in Modern Literature. University of Pittsburgh Press, 1970. 226 pp. $6.95. Reviewed by RUTH SEELHAMMER, Gonzaga University The laughter of Alec Guinness on the stage of the Plymouth Theatre in New York in 1964, as he portrayed "Dylan," came eleven years after the death of the poet. The laughter, however, was not confined to the stage. John McCarten, reviewing the play in January of that year, noted that Guinness "constantly pulls that tough trick of keeping you between laughter and tears." No less moving were the words Guinness spoke, f'Whether we last the night or no." One was tempted, upon hearing them, to regret the early death of Thomas as one is tempted to regret the early death of Hopkins, '8whose words he [Dylan Thomas] read and imitated" according to Annis Pratt in this well-wrought book Miss Pratt, courageously perhaps, decided "to risk laughter from the grave" in order to bring us closer "to an understanding of the unique symbolic universe underlying Thomas' work." Thomas' own words come to the surface: ". . . I want laughter in books: the sight, and smell and sound of laughter." The scope of Miss Pratt's treatment is concentrated, though not limited, to the early prose (not collected until after the death of Thomas) since she considers that particular section of his work as having more poetic unity with the poetry than the later prose which, in her view, was written with a different motivation. Her book takes its place in the world in company with some twenty previous book-length studies of Dylan Thomas listed in the excellent bibliography which, in this attractively-produced volume in the Critical Essays in Modern Literature series, is preceded by three valuable ap- pendices. The first, @'A Comparative Chronology of the Prose and Poetry" and the second, a six-page treatment of XThe Critics and the Problem of Influence" are followed by a third which is the result of an intensive scrutiny of the contents of the issues of the surrealist periodical transition (not Tradition, as an earlier reviewer would have it) from 1929 through 1936. During this period Thomas was involved, directly and indirectly, with those contents and with some of the people who produced them, 939</page><page sequence="234">Jung, Eluard, Kafka, Joyce, Kandinsky, Arp and T. S. Eliot among them. The chief intention in the book goes beyond the focus on the early prose to illuminate a "coherent poetic vision" of the whole body ot work. It is achieved by an examination of the structure, mythology and religion of the early prose, with a section devoted to Blake and the occult, moving to surrealism as a literary method (as previously outlined by Herbert Read) and its effect on Thomas. The intimation is that each work of his contains the elements of myth, theology, the occult and surrealism, with certain of these works used in each chapter to best illustrate a particular influence. The later prose and narrative poetry are, as a final chapter, taken into account. From this thoroughly-documented treatment one comes to a rereading of what Thomas wrote with the expectation of its holding together in a "self-regenerating cyclical structure" whereby it is not possible to dismiss, easily, the early prose which had been @'when published, often invidiously compared to the later prose." Annis Prattts insights are lucid and generous, though she recognizes the "maudlin and repetitive" in the early verse and the fact that Thomas, unlike Joyce, had never emerged from "adolescent themes." If she has been too generous, the works themselves will tell by "whether they last . . . or no." If the creative mythology, said to stem from the early prose, is intrinsic to the work of Dylan Thomas rather than a system imposed from the outside then the reading of this book is time well-spent.

MORSBERGER, California State Polytechnic College, Pomona The Art of James Thlurber is a curiously uneven book, sometimes per- ceptive and gracefully written, sometimes pedantic, self-conscious, and repetitive. In attempting to interpret Thurber according to the theories of comedy that he teaches at the University of Pittsburgh, Tobias some- times distorts his subject. For a book on Thurber, this one tells more about Aristophanes and Moliere than the reader may want to know. An elaborate 940</page><page sequence="235">interpretation of The Male Animal as a reenactment of archetypical Greek rituals in which the New King of fertility defeats the Old King of Winter is both unconvincing and irrelevant; Mrs. Thurber is on record as labeling the chapter"Professional hogwash." Neither is it convincing or enlighten- ing to have Emma Inch compared to the '@Man with a Hoe,'t Harold Ross to Prince Halr and Mr. and Mrs. Monroe to Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. An undeveloped comparison of three alleged but unexamined stages in Thurber's career to the Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso ignores the deepening pessimism of Thurber's final years. On the other hand, Tobias slights genuine developments in Thurber's content and tech- niques. He lumps in The Wonderful O (1957) and Further Fables (1956) with the work of the early 1940's, he ignores Thurber's comments on politics and war, and he largely overlooks the changing relationships of husband and wife in the continuing battle of the sexes. Biographical back- ground is kept to such a minimum that we do not learn about the ways in which Thurber's growing blindness affected his perceptions and his methods of work. Tobias does provide perceptive chapters on the fairy tales, a good analysis of the "Pet Departmentf' and pedagogy, a sensitive study ot Thurber's prose style, and close readings of numerous stories and essays. His interpretation of the comic mask as a defense against a world of gadgets, pressures for conformity, and threats to individualism is sensitive, though it is not true that Thurber's cartoon men and women all look alike. There is a good deal of skillful writing and commentary throughout. But the tone is frequently sententious, and there are many mannered first- person intrusions, often several times a page. The author is frequently "astonished't; his breath is taken away four times in two paragraphs/ and twice in one chapter he informs us of his favorite Thurber moral, mis- quoting it the second time. He even wonders @'lf Thurber's shade could speak to me," though later he apologizes to the shade. The organization of the book is rambling, there is a good deal of redundancy, and phrases like the "anesthetized heart" of Thurber's reader are greatly overworked. Some interpretations are dubious; grim stories like @'The Whip-poor-will," which is about murder (Thurber wrote it during the deep depression of multiple eye operations), "One Is a Wanderer" about divorce and loneli- ness, and "Teacher's Pet" are labeled comic with no explanation. Tobias's praise of The Thurber Album and The Years with Ross as Thurber's best work is both unexplained and at odds with Thurber's own evaluation. Finally, there are curious omissions. Tobias totally ignores several hundred uncollected Thurber pieces in periodicals, explaining that he has not gone beyond the published collections "since he [Thurber] chose those for me." There is little discussion of Thurber's animals (Tobias calls them inferior to humans, badly missing Thurber's point) and practically none on the cartoons and illustrations. Most of the footnotes simply say "See Works Consulted.' The slight bibliography not only omits the un- collected pieces but also four books of cartoons, two prose collections, and many interviews, as well as Edwin Bowden's definitive bibliography, which had appeared earlier. Since Tobias announces that he is omitting much material, one cannot fault him for unintentional neglect, but the omissions limit the usefulness of the book. 941</page><page sequence="236">C Baldwin, Alice Breme.

Atheneum, 1969. 300 pp. $10. Reviewed by RICHARD HAUER COSTA, Texas A &amp; M University No one has ever kept the score of Wells' hits and misses as a prophet nor needs to. His major contribution to the future in his own time cannot be found among his forecasts but in his life. The enormous extent to which Wells himself was the shape of things to come is well shown in this first full-dress biography of H. G. Wells since Vincent Brome's study of nearly twenty years ago. In both his books and his life, Wells anticipated fully the Angry Young Man. His childhood had been shattered by the cruelty of Victorian society which seemed bent on relegating him to the trash- heap of drapery. In evoking the poignant story of how Bertie Wells forced his mean and sickly body from provincial torpor to London haven and Huxley and almost overnight literary fame, Dickson is no more successful than other biographers dating from Geoffrey West's still unsurpassed H. G. Wells: A Sketch for a Portrait, published in 1930 when Wells was still in his hey-day. Those years were described in nonpareil style in Wells' best novel, Tono-Bungay, and in his autobiography. Dickson is more successful in bringing to life the later years of crisis when, in his early forties and with a score of volumes already published and status as a public figure well in hand, Wells chose the Shavian preference to be a force recognizable essentially in one's own time. He became the Fabian who lived in audacious common-law relationship with the blue-stocking daughters of other Fabians. He became the no-longer- young enfant terrible who by the sheer verve of his anticipations wedded to an early sense of the absurd in any vital man's relation to Victorian society forced the books he wrote and the ideas he lived on Shaw and the Webbs, on Henry James, on the establishment of the Edwardians. His one aim, as expressed brilliantly by Lovat Dickson, was to demonstrate "how to break out of the repressive restrictions which an older generation endeavored to maintain, how to make one's life worthwhile in purpose, how to find that companionship in love which was essential even in the 945</page><page sequence="240">pursuit of high aims." The issue was pounded home by Wells in book after book as the distance between himself and the personae of his novels narrowed fatally. Dickson's discussions of the unread novels of Wells' middle period each one containing a hero that bore a replica of Wells' own moral history-are the best things in the book: Ann Veronica (1909), an embattled novel in which Wells, by creating a Valkyrie suffragette after the model of his own young mistress, fought Mrs. Grundy and perhaps eased the way for the greater novels of Lawrence and Joyce; The New Machiavelli, an early (191 1 ) forecast of political scandal a la Profumo; Boon (1915), an uneven, bitter book little read outside the literati but as fierce and brilliant a parody on Henry James and the mandarins as their victims and Wells, despite huge popu- larity and success, has never ceased being one of those victims ever produced. Dickson dares more than any biographer so far to catalogue Wells' amours. His chronicle of the impact of Rebecca West as mistress and intellectual partner is courageous but necessarily incomplete. This chapter in the lives of both artists will some day takes its place beside Chopin- George Sand of an earlier time or of Sartre-Simone de Beauvoir in our own. Although occasionally obliged to be evasive about the names of other women in Wells' full love life, Dickson never stoops to the level of women's-magazine journalism as did Antonin, Vallentin in her 1950 biography. What he knows of Wells' rampant Jexuality becomes grist for the larger story he would tell of Wells' destructive disposition always to excuse individual disorder where exceptional brains or fine spirits were involved. What Lovat Dickson who, as an editor and director of MacMillan, publisher of most of Wells' novels, knew his subject in the 1930's, is really saying is that Wells failed as man and artist because of a lack of moral values. "In the permanent world of art," Dickson concludes, "individual man is the study-not what he shall do with his life, but what makes him a man, what makes him both the creature and a worthy adversary of his God." This is well put even though it has been said about Wells since the moment he emerged on the London literary scene after the publication of The Time Machine in 1895. H. G. Wells, always a man in a hurry, kept changing his stance in book after book, a liver of nine lives ever in search of a tenth. Nothing no organization, no philosophy, no woman, no literary genre could contain him. One suspects that in his lifelong horror of traditional forms, be they of life or literature, he would be more at home in the present phase of ever-New Morality, non- fiction novels, and para-journalism. The idea of permanence was ana- thema to Wells, and all his best books are warnings to mankind against maintaining any stake in the present. The trouble with the man who believes that if the world does not please it can always be altogether changed is that his exhortations will soon be seen as the promise of a pot of gold if only society would legislate a rainbow.

Reviewed by KINGSLEY WlDMER, San Diego State College Now that Miss Lonelyhearts and The Day of the Locust are widely, and rightly, recognized as some of the finest fiction and prophecy of the American 1930s and as enduring nightmares of our technocracy's culturet a full scale biography of Nathanael West was inevitable. Professor Jay Martin, going beyond the memorialists and the important preliminary work of James Light, and with access to previously unavailable papers, provides the first major attempt at a comprehensive literary life Having checked with his living sources, I can report, with awe, that his gathering of material has been wide and relentless. It takes rather special talents to dig up and cajole and flatter and tape record so many of West's former friends and associates. Martin has also prudently gathered much academic aid as to the background treatment and borrowed plausible, if not particularly original, supporting materials on the times. No matter what was done or undone with such research, the efforts themselves could not but be impressive. I suppose that we can hardly ask that the energies and techniques of accumulation and borrowing of current biographers also display literary and intellectual command. Yet Martin should certainly be given credit for attempts at biographical and critical interpretations, even if they sometimes splutter into ponderous irrelevance. For example, of West's choice as a freshman at Tufts not to take a major requiring Greek and Latin (he was always a lazy, cheating, 947</page><page sequence="242">and poor student)l, Martin writes: "Infused by the spirit of the modern, and in full revolt against the massive past, West saw in the languages of antiquity the summation of all that was most sterile and dead in Ameri- can life." The real West, always the mocker of pretension and rhetoric, could have had satiric fun with such silliness about an unacademic seventeen year oldt and with such a weird sense of America. Other examples could be cited. The most massive come in the pon- derous melodrama about West's death in an automobile accident at thirty-seven and in the biographer's over-emphasis on West's trivial pub- lishing problems. Both inflate the commorlplace. (Is there any serious and original American author who hasn't had publishing troubles?) But let us turn to the literary commentary which, perhaps because of the short life of the subject, is given considerable space for a biography. Carefully avoiding critical analysis and judgment, Martin catalogues sources and motifs of The Dream Life of Balso Snell. If related by the reader to the interpretations other critics have made of that closet novel as a faltering exercise in self-parody the arty young man savaging rhetorical preten- sions ("Art is sublime excrement") and his own exacerbated self- consciousness this material might have some use. Martin's discussions of Miss Lonelyhearts and The Day of the Locust seem better, perhaps because of unacknowledged use of the recent inter- preters of those works. (The lack of bibliography, or even referencet to many of the better critics of West will irritate learned readers.) Martin gives significant passages and motifs from Miss Lonelyheartst though he does not much emphasize its stylized hysteria and its main structural para- dox of treating religiousness, and unameliorable human suffering, as both anquishedly serious and humorously sick. By ornate comparison of A Cool Million with The Waste Land, the biographer avoids any evaluation of that desperately trite attack on the trite-American success template. More T. S. Eliot comparisons, along with rather forced parallels to Fitzgerald, provide Martin's literary perspective on The Day of the Locust. Much more usefully, Martin follows his informants and presents interesting material on his subject's sense of the actual Hollywood-West is more of a "realist" than often granted but the biographer hardly provides an adequate attitude towards the southern California ambiance. Since we have sensibly learned not to expect too much critical judg- ment and acumen from biographers, it may not be altogether fair or pertinent to emphasize the discussion of the novels. Certainly the biographical data, especially on West's obsessive self-mythicizing, is often suggestive. Yet Martin oddly plays down physical description, even of the crucial adolescence. West's awkwardness, forced dandyism and com- pensatory fanatical hunting combined with his fondness for prostitutes, his outrageous fabrications about his past, and his flight from his Jewishnes and from marriage suggest the central biographical ,sattern. A number of commentators, such as Stanley Edgar Hyman and Victor Comerchero, have properly emphasized the importance of certain Oedipal patterns in West's work. (Randall Reid's attempted refutation of them in his book on West finally serves to reenforce their importance.) We would therefore expect a biographer to at least explore a bit West's relation to his strong- charactered Jewish immigrant mother. And to the sister he was much 948</page><page sequence="243">dependent upon. Even if one were to ignore the Oedipal themes in the fictions (and the compulsive anti-Semitic wisecracks) as Martin does, or to accept West's rationalizations, such as that he couldn't afford to marry (even though he was a well-paid Hollywood hack) until nearly thirty- seven, as Martin also does, still, one could commonsensically expect some detailing of the crucial family relationships. Martints biography is grossly deficent heref actually obscuring rather than probing the psycho- logical anguish behind West's and his fictional figures'- mixture of pessi- mistic rage and self-destructive passivity. Martin provides considerable detailing on Hollywood leftism of the thirties, though he misleadingly insists that it did not influence West as a novelist in spite of his strong personal involvement. (Obviously, for instance, West followed the usual leftist view of fascism of the times and emphasized that the vicious mob at the end of his Hollywood novel was almost entirely made up "of the lower middle classes.") Part of the biographer's difficulty here comes from a curiously vague sense of society in which, for example, all non-middle class people, including the marginal and lumpen outcasts who obsessed West, are repeatedly presented as "the masses." Martin's sense of West's society is no more probing and perceptive than his sense of West's psyche. Does this biography's admirable accumulation of information and efficient organization of material sufficiently counter its intellectual inade- quacies? This is not really a bad book, just a frequently uninsightful one which requires constant reinterpretation. Given the practical imperatives, we cannot even strongly blame a biographer these days for pursuing an inappropriate subject. A decade ago, when Edward Nehis completed his '@composite" biography of D. H. Lawrence, several reviewers hoped it would establish a new mode of biography. Academic scholars of literary figures of the recent past would humbly gather and compile the varied materials, the autobiographical and divergent first-hand views, without im- posing upon or muddling around their subjects. West would have been an excellent figure, and Martin would have been an appropriate editor, for such work, presenting the cogent documents and leaving each reader as the final biographer. Unfortunately, such industrious modesty has not caught on. So we must make do with more ambitiously pretentious flights, and keep a good bit of critical salt at hand to help catch the birds.

Fred- erick Ungar, 1968. 206 pp. $5.00. Reviewed by JOSEPH 1. FIREBAUGH, University of M;chigan at F1int Read together, these two books demonstrate the great merit of the American doctoral dissertation. Professor Haberman's subject is the plays, and Professor Papajewski's the entire body of work, including The Alcestiad (which exists for the public only in a German edition) and 950</page><page sequence="245">the latest novel, The Eighth Day. Haberman, however, gives considerable attention to the fiction (except for The Eighth Day, which had not yet been published when he was writing his dissertation), whereas Papajew- ski makes only passing reference to The Matchmaker (The Merchant of Yonkers), in which one might have expected him to show special interest because of its indebtedness to a play by Nestroy. Allowing for dif- ferences of subject and method, the American work is more solid. Haberman has had the advantage of original sources and access to family documents, whereas Papajewski, who is Professor of English at the University of Bonn, has sometimes had to cite secondary sources for Wilder's published words. An initial irritation is that no index is provided for Papajewski's book. The method of this book, which allows a chapter to each of nine works and one chapter to the shorter plays, does not obviate the need of an index. The ten essays which make up Papajewski's work are best described as consisting of summary, exegesis, and critical appreciation and evalu- ation. There is considerable merit in all of these elements: the reader seeking a helpful introduction will find much of what he needs, a tying together of story and idea, a perception of certain facts about the stories which might be missed in a first perusal, and an elucidation of their meaning. For a writer as scholarly and far-ranging as Wilder, what one has always wanted is a thorough study of sources. In this respect, Haber- man's book, when compared with Papajewski's, satisfies earlier curiosi- ties and offers new and interesting and unexpected information. That the characterizations in The Ides of March "are not unaffected by Existen- tialism" (Papajewski, p. 90), is a slight statement indeed compared with the discussion of Kierkegaard by Haberman when he considers Wilder's treatment, in certain works, of the religious life. Earlier studies have paid too little attention to the influence of James Joyce, despite Henry Morton Robinson's and Joseph Campbell's famous charges of plagiarism of The Skin of Our Teeth. Haberman pays much attention to this influence, whereas Papajewski is content with a brief allusion, and neglects to a point to a specific reference to Joyce in Heaven's My Destination or Our Town. It is in matters of European sources, where one would expect Papajewski to be best informed, that he is surprisingly weak. The influence of Andre Obey is mentioned, but not that of Alfred Jarry. The parallel passages from Moliere's L'Avare and The Merchant of Yonkers, which Haberman prints in an appendix, go unmentioned; and there is no explanation as to why the latter play was not considered. Briefly, Papajewski's book is no source study, though he alludes to Terence briefly in the notes to The Woman of Andros and quotes largely from Euripides' A/cestis when he writes about The Alcestiad. It is difficult to see how he could have done otherwise. One of the most interesting demonstrations of source by Haber- man is the indebtedness of Wilder to an early obscure volume by Theodore Dreiser, Plays of the Natural and Supernatural (1916), which was published while Wilder was in college at Oberlin, and which in- spired his short plays. That Dreiser's style influenced Wilder's must be 951</page><page sequence="246">one of the little-known facts of modern literature; that it did so, and that Dreiser's ideas and methods influenced the young Wilder too, is shown in a brief quotation from one of Dreiser's plays, The Spring Recital. Another influence which Haberman explores is that of Gertrude Stein; her effect on Wilder in the moderation of his early somewhat precious style as he developed a style more characteristically Ameri- can, is treated in some detail. From Gertrude Stein, too, writes Haberman, '8he learned to present a untfied idea in a succession of events, and he learned to create the events so that they would never as- sume any importance, because they were never permitted either to be interesting or to reach a climax." Wilder's almost constant perception of the paradox that the uninterest- ing is interesting, that excitement exists in the ordinary, that the apparent climaxes in human affairs are not after all especially climactic this awareness is served admirably by the arrangement of the seven chapters of Haberman's book, which are thematically titled. Most of Wilder's ideas may be seen with a kind of simultaneity in each chapter; no arrange- ment could be happier for an understanding of his work than that we begin by considering "The Savor of Lifes' and end with l'Myth," taking up, on the way, "The Religious Life," "Characterization and Narration," "An American Language," and-but not in that order -"All Times and All Places."

Reviewed by HENRY DAN PIPER, Southern Illinois University For those of us who think of Wilson primarily as a critic this book will be a surprise in that the greater part is devoted to Wilson's imaginative writing. Mr. Frank does not think much of Wilson as a poet or playwright, but he does have a good deal to say in favor of his fiction, particularly Memoirs of Hecate County, which he calls "one of the few worthwhile works of fiction from the 1940's." Stimulated by his argument, I reread the Memoirs, and I believe he is right. It is not just a collection of stories, but a truly integrated work that deserves to be set alongside such other twentieth century collections as Dubliners, In a German Pension, Wines- burg, Ohio, Hemingway's Nick Adams stories, and Go Down, Moses- alongside some of the best books of our time. Even though it was not published until 1946, it is essentially a pre-World War II work in spirit, and coming at the end of an era as it does, it serves as a kind of bridge from The Last Tycoon, Go Down, Moses, and The Day of the Locust (whose surrealism it echoes) to the post-World War II fiction of Salinger, Malamud, and Bellow. Frank is a better critic of Wilson's fiction than of his criticism. His chief touchstone in such matters is Wellek and Warren's Theory of Litera- ture an excellent guide to the analysis of imaginative writing but a dreadful one for the criticism of criticism, since it allows for only one critical methodology. Frank gives his hand away at the start by announcing that "as a critic, Wilson lacks Rene Wellek's erudition, Northrop Frye's imagination, John Crowe Ransom's discrimination, and Austin Warren's brilliance." "Yet", Frank continues, "the latest essay by him in The New Yorker or The New York Review of Books is always an event which perhaps no other living Western writer except Jean-Paul Sartre or Andre Malraux could bring about, and it always excites strong personal feelings ranging from pleasure to annoyance." The problem for the critic, then, would seem to be to account for this effect, to show us how Wilson's criticism makes this impression. Instead, it is Wilson's most powerful and influential critical essays that Mr. Frank dismisses first. His favorite work by Wilson is Patriotic Gore, "an outstanding example of biography and cultural history." Next comes The American Earthquake, "a fine collection of little documents on American life," and then To The Finland Station (which he does not discuss at all on the grounds that it is non-literary). Axel's Castle, on the other hand, according to Frank, "today has been superceded by more elaborate studies of the Symbolists." In Frank's view, "the ultimate justification for criticism is the pleasure in continual oscillation with the primary response to a work of art- of analyzing the work's effect, of determining how it makes its impres- sion." "But for Wilson," he goes on to say, "this task is not enough. He always needs to make a social or moral application. Concerned more with what literature should do for life, Wilson has avoided as 'academic' esthetic questions, skirting the work of art itself to confront on its periphery thinkers and moralists." 954</page><page sequence="249">Frank is right in recognizing that Wilson stands at the very center of the Humanist tradition, and in pointing out his affinities with Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer More, two older Humanists whom he attacked and helped to dethrone. But Frank ignores that greater Humanist tradition that Wilson shares with Eliot and Arnold, as well as with such contemporaries as Lionel Trilling, F. O. Matthiessen, Malcolm Cowley, and Alfred Kazin. What sets the truly humanistic critic apart from Wellek, Warren, Frye, and Company is his literary art an eloquence that has somehow eluded the net of Mr. Frank's analysis. As Wilson himself said in his essay, "The Historical Interpretation of Literature": "How, you may ask, are we to distinguish this elite who know what they are talking about? They are self-appointed and self-perpetuating, and they will compel you to accept their authority.... The position of the people who understand writing (as is also the case in every other art) is simply that they know what they know, and that they are determined to impose their opinions by main force of eloquence or assertion on the people who do not know." Or, as Auden has said, Time will pardon even Paul Claudel "for writing well." The attempt to reduce literary criticism to a science is an undertaking that only graduate students in English and their tenured preceptors can afford to pursue. For the layman and we are all layman more or less in the presence of a work of art-criticism, like the major arts that stimulate and nourish it, is a minor art in which eloquence and power of intellect steal the laurels every time from under the noses of the estheticians.

Reviewed by OSCAR CARGILL, New York University Most writers come a cropper with Thomas Wolfe by trying to com- prehend the whole of him in an essay or book. Paschal Reeves in 955</page><page sequence="250">THOMAS WOLFE Thomas Wolfe's Albatross is wisely content to follow a minor theme whither it leads in Thomas Wolfe's plays and fiction, thereby achieving a tightness of treatment instead of the splay-footed diffusion of some other critical efforts. Further, his minor theme, Wolfe's evaluation of the contribution of other races and nationalities to America, might have become a major theme had Wolfe lived to complete his chronicle of one hundred and fifty years of American life and to assemble his host of two hundred characters. It is one of Reeves's merits that he only oc- casionally slips into the position of regarding this theme as major in the published work, of making it the morally ponderous "albatross" of his title. He has so diligently searched, not only that work, but the scraps and fragments of Wolfeana in the William B. Wisdom collection at Harvard, for every reference to the Negro, the Jew, the Celt, the Nordic, the Latin, the Oriental, the Indian, and What-Have-You that that particu- lar job will never have to be done again. In forty-odd years of reviewing I have never applied the word "definitive" to anything, save derisively, but I yield it to Reeves's accomplishment. What further inspires satisfaction is the fairness of the treatment of Wolfe's point of view. Reeves recognizes, without saying it! the pre- posterousness of Wolfe's assumption of adequate experience on which to base evaluations of other races and nationalities. Urban boarders, city dwellers, allegedly sophisticated students, status-wanters- all were aliens who were not of his blood and condition, as they were to most rural Americans in the twenties. At his best, Wolfe was a college-trained man who had traveled and who had sampled life with a gross appetite, but who had, perhaps, digested too little; at his worst, a narrow, bigoted, mountain "grill." Yet he was never quite consistently either. But Reeves notes in him an ever-growing tendency toward just appraisal and, ap- proaching the end of his life, sympathetic treatment of the socially wronged and comprehension of their lot. Where the portraits are stereotyped, they are usually brief and might have been modified had Wolfe achieved the epic of his vision. Mr. Reeves properly notes that the editorial pencils of Perkins and Aswell have struck out of the manu- scripts some offensive epithets and passages. Reeves's treatment is "definitive" only in regard to the "permanent" Wolfe, the Wolfe that survives in print and holograph. As the "im- permanent" Wolfe fades away he died thirty-one years ago, what he was actually like becomes of less consequence, perhaps. But surviving contemporaries cannot forget the virulence, far beyond the literary record, of his early anti-semitism. "Abe Jones" and his sister, and "Esther" were real persons whom we saw cruelly hurt. The man had a streak of sadism in him. On the other hand, we recall Wolfe's chivalric defense of a de- partment secretary, a dark, lissome Rebecca, who married a young teacher of great, and now realized, promise. This new husband had a double handicap another faith and a mother bent on destroying the union. He drew the thunderbolts of Wolfe's wrath by abusing the poor girl in Wolfe's hearing. The sky reverberated from Montauk Point to the Jersey hills and a seismic tremor ran under Greenwich Village. Must the whole man be divorced from the Artist? This is one of the teasing issues that criticism must sometime settle. Reeves complicates the matter by bringing into the discussion "Esther's" books, The Journey Down and 956</page><page sequence="251">Three Blue Suits. Are they legitimately brought in? Is Reeves interested purely in Thomas Wolfe's writing "albatross" or in his personal history? In this respect, the study sometimes lacks sharp definition of its aims, and secondly and of more importance, challenging design in the presenta- tion of its materials. To treat, in mathematical sequence, Wolfe's handling of different racial and national elements in America's composition, particularly after he is through with the sensational Negro and Jewish elements, produces a book of dwindling interest and reader appeal. Be- cause treatment of Wolfe's theme presents aesthetic and rhetorical prob- lems of which Reeves does not seem aware, and because I am of Remy de Gourmont's opinion that a critic has the obligation of creating an imagi- native design in his work, I am happily reminded of one of that French- man's observations: "Je crois bien, mon amie, que jamais un article de revue ne vous amusa autant que celui ou lton accumula, pour ltedifica- tion des freres de la vertu, les preuves de la chastete de deux amis couches dans le meme lit."

University of Pittsburgh Press, 1970. 262 pp. $6.95. Reviewed by RICHARD ABCARIAN, San Fernado State College, Northridge, California 958</page><page sequence="253">For anyone who wants to understand the relationship between literary reputation and social and political life, the case of Richard Wright is instructive. Despite the enormous initial success of his first novel, Native Son, despite an autobiography, Black Boy, which is as important a literary and cultural document as Franklin's autobiography, Richard Wright has been accorded only passing reference in the influential critical and his- torical works on American literature. There are, no doubt, scores of American literature Ph.O.'s who were never assigned a single line of Richard Wrightts during their student days. They might have heard that he was a black naturalist or read R. P. Blackmur's magisterial pronounce- ment that "Native Son is a work in which everything is taken with serious- ness except the writing." They could have read this in Blackmur's Language As Gesture (1952) or in any one of many critical works where it was approvingly quoted. Now we are in the midst of a Richard Wright revival. Two years ago Constance Webbts biography and a special Richard Wright issue (Decem- ber 1968) of the Negro Digest appeared. Last year were published the first book-length critical studies of Wright, Edward Margolies' The Art of Richard Wright and Dan McCall's The Example of Richard Wright, as well as a special Richard Wright number of the CLA lournal (June 1969). Just published is Russell Brignano's Richard Wright: An Introduction to the Man and His Work. Others will certainly follow. The new interest in Wright is inseparable from the recent history of racial turmoil in this country and, more specifically, the growing violence of black rage and white backlash. White literary critics and historians are only now beginning to recognize that in literature as in life we have created a kind of ghetto which has systematically and persistently ex- cluded black literature for so long that most of us are ignorant of its extent and richness. One's first impulse is therefore to welcome Mr. Brignanots book as one of the lamentably few efforts to penetrate our dark ignorance, but is somewhat put off to discover that Wright's "creative efforts usually reveal first a Negro conscious of his race, second an artist committed to polished performance," and that the author has utilized biographical and historical material because much of Wrightts work is "aesthetically displeasing.t' One begins the book, then, uneasy about the author's attitudes toward his subject. Brignano, adopting a thematic organization, divides his study into four chapters and a postscript. Chapter One, "On the American Primary Colors" deals with Wright's early life and the racial theme of his fiction. Chapter Two, "Marxism, the Party, and a Negro Writer" discusses Wright's membership in the Communist Party and the influence of Marxism on his writings. Chapter Three, "New Perspectives C)utside America" covers Wright's exile in Paris and the works of this period, mostly non-fiction, which reflected his keen interest in international and Third World politics and culture. In the final chapter, "The Philosophical Premise," Brignano examines Wright's works in terms of their moral and philosophical as- sumptions, tracing their sources to his early childhood, his study of Marxism and, later, existential philosophy. His organizational scheme forces Brignano to split up Wright's fiction, 959</page><page sequence="254">RICHARD WRIGHT dealing with one part here (Marxism) and another part there (racism). Unfortunately, this forces an assault on the artistic integrity of Wright's works. For example, Brignano's discussion of Native Son deals with racism in Chapter One, Marxism in Chapter Two, and existentialism in Chapter Four. One would be more inclined to accept this kind of splitting up if at some point Brignano offered a full and systematic analysis of the novel as a whole. Indeed, Brignano seems averse throughout to literary analysis though not to literary judgment. What literary analysis is offered is often opaque. For example Brignano likes the defectively plotted story "Down by the Riverside," because the central character's "violent revenge upon the white man is mitigated by his humane solutions to various dilemmas" (he has helped save some white people during a flood) and because he is "a poor, ignorant Negro who murders but who is easily forgiven by the reading audience." On the other hand, Brignano is highly critical of the much more skillful and moving "Long Black Song," the story of a hard- working black man, Silas, who murders the white salesman who has raped his wife and then waits unflinchingly in his shack for the inevitable mobt taking as many men as he can with him before he is cut down. Brignano remarks, without explanation, that the death of Silas "undercuts the picture" and goes on to assert, more remarkably, that "the justification for Silas' murder of the salesman is hardly convincing." Brignano's attention to his thematic categories seems to dictate rather too strongly his literary judgments. For example, with the possible excep- tion of "Fire and Cloud," all the stories in Uncle Tom's Children are set in what can only be described as the rural south. Slarxist theory asserts that revolution will be created by the proletariat and Wright was a Marxist when he wrote these stories. Controlled by these two facts! Brignano first describes the settings of these stories as "small towns of the South" and then, three sentences later refers to the "urban setting" of the stories which "provides a convenient basis for a broader Marxist application...." This is not to deny the importance of Wright's commitment to the Communist Party nor that ideology at times blinded him to the demands of his art. But to describe the settings in Uncle Tom's Children as "urban," to see the mother in "Bright and Morning Star" as "a symbol of those who would interfere with the work of the Party out of selfish emotional motivations" rather than as one of Wright's older, passive women (usually mothers) whose Christianity prevents them from fighting against oppres- sion, to assert about Native Son that "with the appearance of Jan Erlone, the young Party worker . . . the novel becomes blatantly propagandistic" this is to be blinded to Wright's art by his Communism. One is disconcerted if not surprised, then, to find Brignano writing, at the very end of his book, that "Except for brief instances in B/ack Power and Pagan Spain, Wright had never displayed an ability or a propensity to transform into words any evocations and impressions he might have received from natural beauty and phenomena." Only a critic more interested in Procrustean categories than in Wright's artistry could have missed the pastoral elements in Uncle Tom's Children, Black Boy, The Long Dream, and other works by Wright. 960</page><page sequence="255">Brignano devotes an entire chapter, about one fourth of his book, to Wright and the Communist Partyr but is apparently unaware of the lengthy review of Native Son in the New York Sunday Worker by Ben- jamin Davis, Jr, a black man who was a ranking Party leader. Nor does Brignano mention the important review and discussions of the novel in four issues of New Masses. Nor did he include in his research the special Richard Wright issue of Negro Digest, referred to at the outset of this review. Brignano could have profited not only from the critical and biographical information contained in this issue but perhaps even more from seeing Richard Wright through the eyes of a group of articulate and sensitive black critics. It seems to me that anyone who undertakes to assess Wright as writer and man must, one way or another, examine the reasons for the renewed interest in Wright. What have we learned during the last decade or two that now makes Wright a much more important writer to.us than he seemed? The answer must surely and centrally take account of such works as James Baldwin's essay "Notes of a Native Son," the Autobiogra- phy of Malcolm X, Claude Brown's Manchild in the Promised Land, Calvin Hernton's Sex and Racism in America, William H. Grier and Price M. Cobb's Black Rage, and Frank Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth. Brignano gives no indication that he is aware of them. Had Brignano read these works and others like them and had he acquainted himself with the writings about Wright, and the tradition of black literature, he might have arrived at a juster appreciation of Wrightts considerable literary achievements and contemporary significance. Richard Wright fashioned his great works out of his life as a black man in America. Anyone who would undertake an analysis of his life and works must make the difficult effort to understand what being black in America means. Brignano's Richard Wright: An Introduction to His Life and Works is an example of what can happen if he does not. Margolies, Edward. THE ART OF RICHARD WRIGHT. Preface by Harry T. Moore. Crosscurrents / Modern Critiques. Southern Illinois University Press, 1969.168 pp. $4.95. Reviewed by LOUISE BLACKWELL, Florida A &amp; M University In view of our pressing need to integrate black studies into high school and college curricula, The Art of Richard Wright by Edward Margolies comes as a useful study for both English and social science teachers. It can also serve the general reader as a valuable introduction to Wright's work. Although this type of attention to the achievement of Richard Wright is overdue, Margolies goes far toward atoning for our critical negligence. His brief study, however, leaves room for additional work that will enlarge upon the unique insights that Wright brought to bear upon the national and international obsession with race, insights that made of him a prophet in his own time. To the person who is already familiar with the life and works of Richard Wright, the remarkable fact is that he survived his early years and succeeded in producing some fourteen volumes of fiction and non- 961</page><page sequence="256">fiction, plus many short, uncollected items. What kind of man was this who, though born in rural Mississippi, could overcome bigotry, poverty, restrictive family religion, and poor schools to rise to international fame and fortune in the writing profession? His formal education ended with the ninth grade, yet he became friends with the notables of the world, in- cluding Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and Jean-Paul Sartre. To know this man, one must know his works. In the final analysis, then, he created himself as he struggled toward full expression of his powers in the written word. Richard Wright has been, for a generation of black writers, what William Faulkner has been for a generation of white Southern writers. He was the beginning, an original, whose example pointed the way for younger writers to exploit themes and techniques in order to achieve the work that lay ahead of them. He freed them, in a sense, to use the experiences of their lives to tell the world how it is with black people in America. Like writers in the tradition of Faulkner, the younger black writers, i.e., James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison, have felt compelled to sharpen their techniques and to cut new paths for themselves, but their work has been easier because Richard Wright blazed a trail for them. In The Art of Richard Wright, Margolies has undertaken an objective study of Wright's works, identifying the weaknesses as well as the strengths of his art. He is right, of course, to criticize Wright for not submerging the contemporary theories of psychology, sociology, and ideology in the drama of his fictional works. On the other hand, it is worth pointing out that Richard Wright, like Lillian Smith and certain other writers who arrived on the literary scene about the same time, was largely self-taught. Not only was Wright self-taught in the theories of Freud and Karl Marx and in literary style, but he had, again like Lillian Smith, a message for the American people. And, being a black South- erner, he had learned quite as well as William Faulkner and Lillian Smith, to say nothing of Flannery O'Connor later on, that readers often have to be shocked into understanding and recognition of human problems. Wright's message was paramount; he was a spokesman for black Americans; he became a spokesman for minority groups throughout the world. Thus the criticism of Margolies is more applicable to the fictional works of Wright than to his nonfiction works. With regard to such books as Black Boy, 12 Million Black Voices, and White Man, Listen, I agree with Richard Gilman's statement in The New Republic to the effect that certain kinds of books by black writers are acts of "creation and defini- tion of the self" and cannot be judged by "'disinterestedt intellectual criteria." It is futile, for instance, to complain that Wright neglected certain aspects of his childhood life in B/ack Boy, such as sexual attractions, the good things in growing up, the whites who were not hostile, and so on. In this book, Wright was defining himself; he was probing the wounds of his early life in the South in order to cure himself and move on to freedom and productivity. And even as he did this, the Iyrical passages help to define the man, too, a young, robust man whose life welled within him despite the isolation and misery of those years. How, then, can we judge how well Wright succeeded in explaining himself to him- self? The best we can do is to try to understand him by submerging 962</page><page sequence="257">ourselves in the experiences that Wright considered significant in the shaping of his personality and life. In his critical analyses of the novels and short stories, Margolies makes sound and helpful comments upon Wright's successes and failures in characterization, style, and theme. He concludes that the short stories are generally more successful than the novels because they do not bear the ideological cargo that constituted major flaws in the longer works. The stories, with their settings in the South, deal with the day-to-day struggle of black people to survive, while the novels, set in the North, reflect Wright's life as a Communist and as a reader of Freud after he went to Chicago, New York, and Paris. All in all, Margolies should be commended for bringing The Art of Richard Wright to us at this time. B Abcarian, Richard, ed. RICHARD WRIGHT'S NATIVE SON: A CRITICAL HAND- BOOK.

ELINOR WYLIE A Gray, Thomas Alexander. ELINOR WYLIE. Twayne's United States Authors Series, No. 165.172 pp. $3.95. Reviewed by EVELYN THOMAS HELMICK, University of Miami Using the techniques of the "New Critics," Thomas A. Gray provides a careful reading and analysis of Elinor Wylie's poetry in this new volume of the Twayne United States Authors Series. The first and second chap- ters, on Nets to Catch the Wind and her technique in general, are the most valuable, offering thoughtful definitions of Gray's method and terms, a summary of Wylie's theories of poetry, and thorough dissection of some of the more significant poems. Skillfully he exposes the word that causes the tone to fail, the phrase that makes the meaning ambiguous, the sound that debilitates the total effect. He finds her work, with a few exceptions, shallow, insincere, and confused. The third chapter groups together the remaining three volumes of poetry because Gray concludes contrary to most critics that Wylie shows no development in her later work. He sees, as Amy Lowell did, only static ideas and forms, nearly all of them derivative. In fact, the fourth chapter traces dozens of Wylie's literary antecedents in her widely 963</page><page sequence="258">eclectic verse. He demonstrates her greater affinity with nineteenth century fin-de-siecle poets than with the metaphysicals so frequently mentioned by her critics. This chapter, more vigorous than the others, is filled with aptly chosen lines to support his charge that she is imitative in an unimaginative way. The study, then, is essentially a treatment of the poetry the subject of Gray's doctoral dissertation to which he has appended a fifth chapter to discuss the novels. All four novels are disposed of in thirty pages of what seems to be almost an afterthought, since there is little interpreta- tion and no attempt to show relationships between the poetry and the prose. The title of that chapter, "Tissues of I rrelevance," may be its author's private joke directed at whoever might have insisted that he add such a limited discussion of the novels to his original material. Gray alludes often to the autobiographical nature of the poetry, but his deliberate avoidance of the "separable content of literature" does not permit him to interpret fully even those poems which he recognizes as a clef (and most of her work is a clef). Further, because he has ap- parently not examined the Wylie manuscripts at Yale's Beinecke Library, he misses the point and the humor of many poems and all of the novels. "Castilian," for example, alters dramatically with the realization that those lines are describing Wylie's third husband, William Rose Benet. Mr. Hazard of the last novel becomes a more interesting character when we see him, at least in part, as Elinor Wylie at forty. Much of the book, therefore, points up the dangers of a critic's limiting himself to a single approach. The book concludes with a note on the critics which insists that those who praised her work were influenced more by the personality of the author than by her art. The bibliography, highly selective, includes an- notated entries of some critics' works. The notes at the end of the text, without page numbers as reference, are infuriatingly difficult to use.
