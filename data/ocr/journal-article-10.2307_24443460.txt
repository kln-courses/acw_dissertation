In that the "example" was the animating idea of the Renaissance epic, Milton's didactic proposition reveals his awareness of his temper as an epic poet in the Defensio Secunda. In the Defensio Oliver Cromwell and the author him self are the "magnanimous" heroes. Milton's description of his Italian journey can be re valuated from this viewpoint also; and be seen as the progress of an heroic character, like that of Ulysses. The outlook, however, is a reformed heroic outlook extolling not a hero of military valor, but an Everyman who submits gallantly to all-governing Providence. Akira Arai. "The Epic Element in Lycidas." The Rising Generation (Japanese; Tokly: Ken kyusha), CXIV, 312—313. In that Lycidas leaves the nether world of water, passes through the upper world where water is deprived of its destructive powers, and arrives at the highest world of heavenly bliss where death and mutibility are driven back, Lycidas employs the Renaissance heroic "pat tern" of the moral pilgrimage of man. By adopt ing the epic theme of the journey of the soul, and the three successive crescendos of "higher" epic tone, Milton pronounced the noblest eulogy on his deceased friend. Fredson Bowers.

"Miltonic Allusion in Absalom and Achitophel: Its Function in the Political Satire." JEGP, LXVIII, i, 24—44. A. W. Verrall was probably the first modern critic to perceive the considerable dependence of Absalom upon PL, but his concern was pri marily stylistic. When we deal with structure, theme, and genre, the question arises whether ". . . we must separate the political satire from a more important heroic base, or may we, per haps, relate these two seeming disparates to show that Dryden's Miltonic heroics have in themselves the elements of political satire? It is the latter alternative which this paper will attempt to demonstrate." We can fully appre ciate the structure of Absalom ". . . only when we have given up the attempt . to turn the author's satire into the critic's epic and see the Miltonic tone for what it is, an integral part of a great but topical political satire directed against the heirs of Milton's party." Albert R. Cirillo. " 'Hail Holy Light' and Divine Time in PL." JEGP, LXVIII, i, 45—56. PL, like any poem, must have the order of sequence. "But, by allowing certain symbols to take on the character of a cumulative pattern that is intimately related to the whole move ment of the poem, Milton transforms this re striction into the metaphor of divine providence itself, into a seemingly simultaneity of events sub specie aeternitatis." A blurring of sequential distinctions seems a deliberate device calculated to contribute to the total effect of the poem. "In an earlier essay I argued a similar case when I suggested that through the careful use of the apparently opposite temporal points of mid 32</page><page sequence="2">night and noon Milton actually suggests that they are reconcilable polarities for the ever lasting present moment of eternity of which time is but the moving image .... My con centration on light, in the following pages, . . . continues that earlier discussion with a slightly different emphasis . . . Jackson Cope. "PR: Inner Ritual." Milton Studies (1969), 51—65. Milton's defence of blank verse was directed in part at Dryden's rejection of it, and Dryden was influenced by the argument in his later drama. But Milton's interest in the heroic drama went beyond versification. Satan oper ates at one level to satirize successfully the basic premise of heroic drama: that super human protagonists can act significantly in a context where love and honor are polarities emptied of the limiting human interplay which gives either meaning. Again Dryden may have listened to Milton, because the development of Almanzor is away from satanic activism toward patience under providence, from assertion of his own will to acceptance of God's. The culmina tion of this interwoven series of literary events is PR, where the pattern which Dryden present ed dramatically is re-enacted in a ritualistic context appropriate to the divine, suprahistori cal point of view which Milton evokes in a number of ways. (JIC) Clifford Davidson. "Sceptre and Keys and Vis ual Images in PL." Dalhousie Review, XLVIII, iv, 439—449. T. S. Eliot's comments on the limitations of Milton's visual imagery because of his blind ness are contradicted by the images of septre and keys in PL. These images, which are em blematic of divine authority, symbolize not only the power of God delegated to the Son but also the righteousness of that power. Just as Christ makes divinity visible, the septre held by him signifies his otherwise less visible authorization. So also Satan raises a septre impotently mimic ing heaven's symbol. The fact that "Sin holds the key to open the gates of death exactly as Christ holds the keys to life" further establishes the precise inversion of heaven. Milton's image of the keys reiterates his doubt of pontifical au thority and he suggests in PL III, 484-496 that "worldly vanity is the source of the illusion that the keys of Christ are placed in the hands of the Roman Church." Thus the recurring images of sceptre and keys demonstrate that the "imagery should depend upon a symbolic meaning which is relevant to the structure of the poem as a whole." Mario A. DiCesare. "PL and Epic Tradition." Milton Studies (1969), 31—50. To study epic tradition is to study not "in fluences" (which may serve to buttress precon ceived notions) but rather the ways in which major poets modified the tradition. Such study can be a way into meaning, particularly in poems as complex as the Aeneid and PL. In both poems, the epic strategy relies on modifica tion in the catalogue and battle conventions. In Vergil's catalogue (Book VII), language and imagery embody the conflict which informs the whole poem, arma-virum. The battle scenes (IX, X) develop this conflict. On both the Latin and the Trojan side, strategy fails and blood lust triumphs. Aeneas' rampage (X) climaxes the ascendancy of power over justice (or forti tudo over sapientia). In PL, in the catalogue and Mulciber passages of Book I, syntax and imagery develop the theme of specious identity; in II and IV, Milton exploits the potential of epic battle, then deliberately aborts the battle with modified "recognition scenes." The War in Heaven develops the fortitudo-sapientia mo tif. But it is only in the love to which Michael firmly leads Adam's understanding (XII) that fortitudo and sapientia are reconciled. (MADC) Michael Fixler. "Milton's Passionate Epic." Milton Studies (1969), 167—192. PL not only sets out to justify God's ways to men, but being an act of worship was intended to celebrate the mystery of God's providence. As a unique devotional offering the work iden tifies poetry and prayer while it discriminates sacramentally two kinds of readers: general ones, and the "fit audience . . . though few." For Milton the prototype of such worship was Apocalyptic, the worship of the Lamb in Revel ation, and the instrument by which such wor ship approached the perfection of ultimate saintly apotheosis was the fiery spirit of prayer which was identifiable with the highest reach 33</page><page sequence="3">of the poetic furors. On this basis it is possible to recognize a greatly enlarged meaning in the allusiveness of the invocation to Book VII. (MF) Roland Mushat Frye. "Reason and Grace: Christian Epistemology in Dante, Langland, and Milton." Action and Conviction in Early Modern Europe (1969), 404—422. The rule that Christianity has always at tempted to preserve a balance between over extending reason and repudiating it ". . . pro vides the most useful basis for understanding the central attitudes toward reason which char acterize classical Christianity, and especially those which formed the bases for Christian humanism." The great Christian poets, for ex ample, Dante, Langland, and Milton, place the Christian squarely in the midst of the chal lenges of human existence, . . where he must express his salvation in the face of problems both rational and irrational." In these three poets there is . . an essential agreement on the relation between reason and revelation." Within the Christian perspective wisdom is a trained and judicious capacity for the full est ordering of life, yet man cannot expect to understand the divine in its full eternal ver ity. "Man does not primarily need informa tion about God . . his greater need is rather for harmony with God. Therefore, God does not give a definition of Himself but gives instead the Incarnation." Thus, under grace, reason becomes Right Reason, a reason fulfilled and extended. David G. Hale. "Milton and the Body Politic." Read at the Northeastern Language Associa tion, St. Bonaventure University, April 11, 1969. Milton's use of the traditional analogy of the body politic is important both in his lit erary biography and in the intellectual history of the seventeenth century. The antiprelatical tracts depart from convention by using ex tended organic analogies to argue for radical change in church and state. He subsequently rejects these "petty glosses and conceits" and defends regicide with the new analogy of the social contract. In PL head and body define the relation of Christ and mankind, Christ and the angels, Adam and Eve, and Satan and the fiends; because of their brevity and simplicity, however, these analogies contribute relatively little to the argument and style of the poem. Implicitly in PL and explicitly in the Christian Doctrine, Milton distinguishes one world of visible, contractural institutions and another world of the mystical and the organic. (DGH) O. B. Hardison, Jr. "Written Records and Truths of Spirit in PL." Milton Studies (1969), 147— 165. Milton considered scripture ("written rec ords pure") man's fundamental source of truth. He is saved from fundamentalism by the belief that scripture must be read in the light of the Spirit and that the truth reveals itself in dif ferent ways to different readers. Hence his treatment of Creation in Book VII departs em phatically from the surface meaning of the Biblical account. There is a strong suggestion that Creation is begun by a sexual impregna tion of unformed matter, followed by an or ganic, almost evolutionary, development of the visible world. The development completes itself in man, whose sexuality in Book IV is the culmination of a motif that begins with the initial impregnation of Chaos by the Spirit. Milton's view is similar to views found in Philo Judaeus, the pseudo-Dionysius, and several Ren aissance Platonists. It illustrates the latitude of interpretation permitted those who read scrip ture in the light of the Spirit. (OBH) Lawrence W. Hyman. "The Unwilling Mar tydom in 5/4." Tennessee Studies in Litera ture, XIII, 91—98. Because it is assumed by many that the roles of active warrior and patient sufferer are reconciled in the final scene of 5/4, they inter pret the conclusion as a reconciliation between Samson and God that allows Samson to over come his doubt and despair. But to some the conclusion is as painful as it is glorious, and to them Samson resembles Oedipus and Lear more than he resembles Christ. Though both the optimistic and pessimistic critics have been perceptive readers, we question here . . an assumption that almost all readers have held, 34</page><page sequence="4">namely, that in his final action, Samson ex presses his submission to God's will. My ar gument is that although God seems to demand of Samson that he exercise the patience of a saint, Samson's final action represents his own ineradicable desire to act like a military hero." Samson himself is aware of this contradiction, and the conflict within him . . makes for a tension that is unequalled in any other work of Milton." Because he realizes that his impulse towards action will bring about his own death, "Samson is never reconciled to the ways of God." Thomas Kranidas. "A View of Milton and the Traditional." Milton Studies (1969), 15—29. Milton's view of the traditional in literature is usually deduced from a handful of orthodox statements on style and genre. In fact, Milton's attitude ought to be deduced from the whole range of his poetry and prose. In the prose, where Milton continually comments on prob lems of language, he steadily condemns un thinking use of authority. His hostility to the merely traditional ought to give us freedom to treat the poetry with emphasis on its own co herence, rather than on consistency with the precepts and models of tradition. In treating the War in Heaven, we ought to allow the possibility of comedy when the local texture urges it on us and we might even see the epi sode as a part of a continuous organic metaphor in the middle of the poem, a great "bodily" disturbance which ends with the evacuation of evil from Heaven. Milton never avoids the chal lenging of good by evil, in his ideas, in his symbolic structures, in his very style. (TK) Anthony Low. "Angels and Food in PL." Mil ton Studies (1969), 135—145. The meal in the Garden shared by Raphael, Adam, and Eve is a symbol of hospitality, of an ideal relationship between man and angel. Its abundance reveals God's goodness, while its simplicity underlines man's innocence. The fruits of the earth which compose it contrast with man's postlapsarian diet. It represents the close ties before the fall between heaven and earth, God and man. Though not "sacramental," it is a "solemnity" that reinforces these ties. It reflects the heavenly feasts described by Raphael, symbolizing the beatific state, up to which man one day will be drawn. Because it has these meanings, Milton uses the meal with Raphael as a symbol of all that is lost when he changes his notes to "tragic." The value of what the meal stands for is seen most clearly from the vantage point of the last books, and especial ly in the contrast between Raphael's visit and Michael's. (AL) Louis Martz. "Chorus and Character in SA." Milton Studies (1969), 115—134. The tragic action of 5/1 develops through a contrast between the language of Samson and that of the Chorus. An essential clue to Milton's art in this drama lies in his effect of deliberately playing down the choruses in the middle, refusing to give the chorus very good lines, except toward the beginning and again toward the end. After each of the central epi sodes, Milton has given the chorus words that are for the most part dry and commonplace, often surprisingly flat. It would appear that Milton's use of rhyme and partial rhyme in the choruses has frequently the effect of lower ing the tone of high seriousness and making impossible any high dignity in the choric speech. The basic effect is to stress, by con trast, the grandeur of Samson, the greatness of his mind and spirit. The weak and ordinary character of Manoa, the complex and enigmatic character of Dalila, and the braggart character of Harapha are all related to this basic con trast between Samson and the chorus. (LLM) Patrick Murray. "Milton's Theology: A New Perspective." Irish Ecclesiastical Record, III, 372-380. The twentieth century reappraisal of Mil ton's dogma has contradicted Sir Walter Ral eigh's description of PL as a 'monument to dead ideas.' The "humanist" critics, such as Denis Saurat, J. H. Hanford, and Edward Greenlaw, discard Milton's theology in favor of an inter pretation which updates his ideas by seculariz ing them. These critics are opposed by C. S. Lewis, Charles Williams, E. M. W. Tillyard, Douglas Bush, and Maurice Kelley who argue that the neglect of the theology in PL radically 35</page><page sequence="5">distorts Milton's intention. Professor Kelley has demonstrated both the heresy of De Doctrina Christiana and its parallels to PL, yet "many generations of careful readers failed to notice Milton's departure from received beliefs" in the epic. This apparent contradiction is resolved by recognizing that in the epic dramatization the heresies explicitly propounded by De Doc trina are obscured by the artistry, thus leaving the reader "at liberty" to choose the interpre tation most amenable to himself. Ants Oras. "Darkness Visible: Notes on Mil ton's Descriptive Procedures in PL." All These to Teach: Essays in Honor of C. A. Robertson. (Gainesville, 1965), 130—143. Milton "may never have seen any Poussin, Claude Lorrain, or Rembrandt but . . . the af finity with these close contemporaries should be difficult to deny. The poet, like the painters, looks beyond the immediate; behind the fore ground, there are depths of background to be searched and explored, obscurities to be pene trated, and sometimes, areas of darkness to be brought to life and made strangely visible." (JHS) B. Rajan. "PL: the Providence of Style." Mil ton Studies (1969), 1—14. If we approach the language-tactics of PL from the inside rather than externally, we see that these tactics are not only the best but per haps the only possible means of bringing the poem into imaginative life. The manner in which the language of the poem is held away from nature enables it to convey the quality of events that are beyond and prior to na ture. Distancing, however, is not disconnection; through the relief of similes and other devices the language maintains its relationship with the everyday. Further, the verse paragraph, with its contention between metrical and gram matical forces, and the syntax, with its delayed resolutions, microcosmically enact the drama of the poem in the drama of the language. The simultaneous sense of both pattern and process is achieved through the backward and forward links of imagery and the manner in which the moment of local life is repeatedly made to open into the whole poem. The style may be formal ly that of secondary epic; but it satisfies with true creative fidelity the demands of both archi tectural and organic decorum. (BR) Sister M. Hilda Bonham, i.h.m. "The Anthro pomorphic God of PL." Papers of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters, LIII, 1968 (1967 meeting), 329—335. Attacks on Milton's anthropomorphic God of PL have all included the accusation that He, as Ward S. Worden said, seems "not always to be on the proper side of the great opaque which separates divinity from humanity." Yet some say that He cannot and should not be, and "that Milton's anthropomorphism is not only inevitable and functional, but even contributes to certain effects which they see as desirable . . for only lately have critics begun to real ize "that it was only by humanizing God that Milton could have Him play a part in the epic." Placing Milton's anthropomorphism in the context of genre, theology, and dramatic irony, "demonstrates that he could not have avoided humanizing God . . that the poet of PL so used anthropomorphism that it serves both the structural unity and even the dramatic effectiveness of the poem." Russell E. Smith, Jr. "Adam's Fall." ELH, XXXV, iv, 527—539. Eve's fall follows from her improper desire to transcend her assigned place in the Divine Hierarchy by means of knowledge. Adam's fall, it is traditionally argued, follows from his fail ure to maintain his proper station in the Divine Hierarchy. "The possibility that Milton's Adam, like his Eve, is ambitious and aspires upward has not yet been considered in the critical in terpretation of the Fall. It is the thesis of this essay that Milton deviates from the traditional explanations of Adam's fall in that his Adam falls for the same reason as does his Eve." If we can forget for a time that Adam must fall down to Eve, . . we will be more sensitive to evidence of a different . . . weakness in Adam. Adam, like Eve, is directly tempted by forbidden knowledge . . John M. Steadman. "Milton's Rhetoric: Satan 36</page><page sequence="6">and the 'Unjust Discourse.' " Milton Studies (1969), 67—92. Satan's role in PL reflects the Socratic-Aristo phanic contrast between Just and Unjust Dis course, or true and false eloquence. Through such devices as verbal echoes, explicit rebuttals, and inherent contradictions, Milton portrays in Satan the character of the arch-sophist. In most of Satan's speeches there is a fundamental dif ference between passages that reveal character (tethoes) and those that display a specious char acter or intent through rhetorical skill or "thought" (dianoia). Neglect of this difference has caused critics (Waldock especially) to con fuse Satan's real character with his feigned character and to claim that Milton's "level of commentary" clashes with his "level of demon stration." The alleged "degradation" of Satan actually consists in the increasing prominence of his role as deceiver. The extent to which he consciously and unconsciously deceives both himself and others can be seen when each speech is examined in relation to its particular circumstances, its function in furthering the plot, and the role of the person addressed. Mil ton emphasizes dianoia more than other ele ments of epic because his prime subject is the development of spiritual values through the testing of both reason and will. (JMS) Arnold Stein. "Satan's Metamorphoses: the In ternal Speech." Milton Studies (1969), 93—113. Beginning with Book IV, Satan's new career forces the orator and master of disguise to speak to himself. The first stage of inner conflict shows the gaps and exchanges between his knowledge and his feeling. Though there are counter movements, the direction and shape of the con flict present a Satan choosing to integrate him self at a level that favors efficiency of purpose. As the inner life narrows, the art of the narra tive voice takes up the moments of greatest intensity and keeps the sense of conflict alive. In effect, Satan transforms himself and does so according to the traditions of moral law. The internal speech demonstrates how he maneuvers himself, freely expressing the passions, motives, and selective awareness by which he moves, but which govern him—so that he is at once "voluntary" agent and victim. (AS) Samuel S. Stollman. "Samson's 'Sunny Locks the Laws': An Hebraic Metaphor." SCN, XXVI, iv, 71—72. In Reason of Church Government Milton re fers to Samson's "sunny locks the laws," his "waighty tresses of his laws," and "his puissant hair, the golden beames of Law and Right." The editors of the Yale Milton say nothing about the association of the sun imagery with the Samson allegory. Samson is an appropri ate vehicle for the radial sun motif because his Hebrew name, Shimshon, means "like the sun." Also, the divine law associated with the light imagery may be found in the Bible (cf. Isaiah 2:5; Hosea 6:5; Micah 7:8; Psalms 4:7). "The Samson-sunlight-divine law complex could easily be the product of these Biblical associa tions." Charles D. Tate, Jr. "Vondel's Reputation in England." Delivered at MLA, December, 1968. George Edmundson's contention that Mil ton incorporated much of Vondel's poetry into PL seems less credible because of the absence of reference to his work in seventeenth-century English letters including Pepys' and Evelyn's journals of their travels to the Netherlands and other compositions about Holland. Not until 1771 is Vondel mentioned—in the Expedition of Humphrey Clinker. The library catalogues of neither Sir Thomas Browne nor John Locke show that they were acquainted with Vondel. Nor have Milton's early detractors suggested this Dutch poet as a source of plagiarism. Von del's reputation in the eighteenth century vacil lated between damnation and applause. The first life published in English appeared in 1854—a twelve page pamphlet—and the first English translation in 1848. But not until 1925, with Dr. Barnouw's Vondel, was there a full length study of this writer as a poet in his own right apart from his English contemporary and present interest in Vondel indicates that his reputation among English-speaking people is still on the rise.
