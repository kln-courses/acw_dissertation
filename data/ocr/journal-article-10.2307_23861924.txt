<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shamanism in Early Israel By Robert D. Miller II (Washington) Several important historiés of early Iron Age Israel have appeared in recent years.1 These provided archaeologically-based reconstructions of early Isra élite society and économies, attentive to connections with the biblical text. Yet the "relatively few, highly complex and ambiguity-ridden concepts around which the social Organization of a culture revolves and the emo tional and intellectual energy of its members is largely spent"2 have been largely ignored. That is, religion, broadly defined, has been for the most part left to the study of the text alone. Archaeology, in its study of material culture, is one of the arenas in which culture and social life most obviously and significantly intersect. Ail artifacts have a symbolic, ideological side - distinct according to context in most cases - and ideology does not exist independently of material culture.3 Moreover, archaeology is suited to "reading" the material culture as text, for understanding that ideological side of artifacts. The "heavy symbolic, semi otic loading of artifacts and the artifactual process helps one to understand 1 U.

The archaeology of religion will include both architecture of special places and the artifacts associated with such places. Significant also will be mortuary information, indicative of ideology much like contemporary texts.5 Additionally, "Space is practice (our everyday actions); it is also symbol."6 "The structuring of space incorporâtes cosmological and symbolic principles in many situations."7 Regional settlement patterns are not archaeological correlates of particular social Systems but a means of situating the control of the Community over resources that operate on places, paths, or over areas of ground surface.8 Space is "categorically defined" by human actors.9 "What we would designate religion was présent in the cultural practices, predicated on shared meanings of land and kinship, that shaped the social occasions of early Israélite Settlements."10 We shall return to conceptual landscape short ly, but first we will be more specific, focusing on the architecture of special places and the artifacts associated with such places in the Iron I period. Rather than simply catalog, we must explain the religion from the arti facts. One could easily assume the biblical text provides such an interpréta tion; it would be most difficult to prove that it does not. But such informa tion is inextricably bound with thick cultural concepts, intentions, and con cerns of the author's own period and of many others before his time.11 The biblical text cannot be used as a direct source for reconstructing cultural Peter G.

Given the near impossibility of identifying texts of a specific time frame, let us explain the artifactual evidence by ethnographie analogy. "The comparative approach does not entail, a priori, any identification, füll or partial, of the phenomena or developments which are being compared."12 But, "reconstructions cannot be achieved without the help of the compara tive method,"13 and as Jonathan Smith reminded us in his SBL Presidential Address last year, "Refusai to be comparative across canons is irresponsible biblical scholarship."14 We cannot simply "attempt, by induetive, empiricist research to infer the religion of early Israel from supposedly objective ar chaeological data; ... no matter how 'objective' a researcher tries to be or how well he or she knows the data, the method produces only an illusion of objectivity and inevitability."15 Ethnographie analogy will provide explanation of the archaeological re alia. But one should aeeept these analogies not merely because of multiple areas of correspondence and sheer weight of parallels. "The Piling up of common attributes cannot be said to make one analogy more probable than another."16 Rather, the merit of the analogies dérivés from seeing the same causal/determining mechanism in both societies, Israel and the comparand, the same behavioral Systems that produce particular artefactual patterns.17 Ancient Near Eastern material will test the reconstructions herein, and fi nally after this, we will turn to the biblical text and its witness to the reli gious phenomena found in the material culture. First, ritual space in Iron I Israel, that is, in the highland settlement, can be catalogued.18 Lawrence Stager is correct that the "Migdal Temple" of 12 Ignace J.

Miller II Shechem is not from the Iron I period.19 The "altar" on Mount Ebal may be cultic. There are too few cooking pots and too many jugs and jars for a sim ply domestic occupation.20 While 81% of all the burnt bones were sheep and goat, the percentage of fallow deer bones (10% overall) is disproportion ately high, and 63% of these were found in the so-called "altar."21 Half the bones are cranial bones, which means that the antlers were being especially sought, to which we will return. There may have been a Secondary Public Cuit Room at Ai. At the end of a street in Site D, there is the tiny room #65 (8.5x2.5m), with a bench at the foot of its wall all the way around, where a 4-story tall 80cm tall fenes trated incense burner with lions' paws as a base was found. Analogous pièc es are Megiddo P6055 and others, two at Teil Qasile, and three at Beth She an. Inside the burner was a clay animal figure (#1091) of a dog or wolf, similar to one found at Taanach. Also in the room were an incense bowl for the top of a cuit stand (#1054), a bovine figurine, and a bowl (#1055) with flat base and a row of breasts around the carination. The so-called "Bull Site" is not an Iron I shrine.22 The pottery and the flint assemblages are those of domestic habitations,23 although it did pro duce an incense burner. We will return to the "Bull" below. But a serious concern is its dating. Although the excavator24 always referred to the site single-period Iron I,25 an independent survey of the site found only flve per cent of the sherds collected to be Iron I.26 And if Finkelstein's redating of "Einun" pottery to the Middle Bronze Age is correct, then 90% of the pot 19 Lawrence Stager, "Fortress- Temple at Shechem and the 'House of El, Lord of the Covenant,"' in Realia Dei, ed.

Overall, this is amazingly meager evidence for public cultic places.30 This is especially clear in comparison to clearly cultic Iron I buildings at Dan (Room 7082), Teil Abu Hawam (T.30), Beth Shean (ST and NT), and Tel Qasile (XII, XI, and X). But these are all outside of the central hill country to which many scholars, including myself, would limit early Israel.31 As for cuit objects, the famous "bull" of the "Bull Site" was not found by archaeologists but was a chance surface discovery by a soldier.32 It cannot be reliably included. The Bull site did produce a ceramic incense burner (if it is analogous to ones from Megiddo and Beth Shean) or model of a shrine (if analogous to one at Teil el-Farah North) - unless these are Middle Bronze. Teil el-Farah North silo 249 produced a similar clay model of a shrine or temple enclosure building,33 and also found on the site was a silver and bronze "Hathor" statuette (#1.491). There are some other small Iron I figurines from around the highlands. Two small busts of horses were found at Bethel (#1054 and #1112), along with a human figurine (#328 from locus 44) and an "Astarte/Anat/ Athirath/Asherah" plaque (#104). An identical plaque was found at Dothan. From Dothan, too, come two animal figurines and an anthropomorphic lamp (#P1344) with a prone male human figure with arms outstretched as if flying, wearing a crown of five clay globules, stuck on the underside. Finkelstein, "Two notes," 97. As per Faust, "Settlement Patterns," 20. Oded Lipshitz, personal communication. On the lack of Iron I cultic sites in Benjamin specifically, see Scott M. Langston, Cultic Sites in the Tribe of Benjamin (American University Studies 7.200; New York: Peter Lang, 1998), 72-179. Cf. Garth Gilmour, "Religion in Israel in the Period of the Judges," Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society Lecture, The British Museum (London, 2006). Mazar, "Bull Site"; Contra Dever, "Archaeology and Ancient," 464. Additional reason for not considering the bull is the possible redating of most of the site's pottery to the Middle Bronze age, parallels to similar bulls from MB contexts could assign the Bull Site's bull to that period, as well; Finkelstein, "Two notes," 97; but cf. Mazar 1999:146-47). I do not consider it valid to interpret the open space, where presumably a divine image could be inserted, to be "empty space aniconism" representing the invisi ble Yahweh, as does Dever, "Archaeology and Ancient," 468.</page><page sequence="6">314 R.D. Miller II There are no parallels. It is 16cm long, made with applied clay in the imita tion of a Tridacna shell. Dothan also produced two jugs shaped like bulls (#P1237 and #P1232). At Ai was found a 7cm-long figurine of a goose, similar to ones at Beth Shean. The Iron I seated god figurine from Hazor, Stratum XI, is too distant from the central highlands for inclusion.34 Some conclusions obtain. There was very little in the way of permanent cultic facilities in early Israel, if these existed at all. There is possible évi dence of altars for the sacrifice of caprovids and a ritual use of deer antlers. There is no ritual use of antlers in the Bible, and antlers do not appear in Pardee's list of ninety-two différent objects mentioned as offerings in Uga ritic texts.35 Searching the entire known ethnographie world for ritual use of antlers shows they are always connected with "Shamanism."36 A définition of sha manism is rather elusive.37 Mircea Eliade's définition of a shaman as one who enters an altered State of consciousness in order to journey to other worlds was for a time widely aeeepted in anthropology.38 But we cannot re ly on Mircea Eliade and his 1951 Chamanisme, translated into English in 1964. Although it greatly stimulated the study of Shamanism, Eliade relied overmuch on one Yakut ethnographer and attempted to squeeze Yakut ideas about soûls, initiation, and torture by spirits into his comparative frame work, overgeneralizing and simplifying even for northern Asia, much less for all the world.39 Mihâly Hoppal writes, "In the literature dealing with the question of sha manism, there is a constant dissatisfaction with the définition of the term 34 Gosta W.

In Mongolia, for example - a culture that will be of great comparative importance in what follows - a living tree has its own soul, and a forest as a whole has its own.44 But ani mistic concepts are also commonplace in areas of the world where shaman ism is unknown.45 So it is safer to list animism as among the constellation (to use Jan Assman's term) of attributes regularly associated with shaman ism.46 At the risk of oversimplifying it, there are four other elements domi nant in this constellation, or five in total, with animism being the fîrst.47 Second, shamans solicit the friendship and aid of theriomorphic spirits or "power animais" in order to help other humans, especially by healing.48 But the shaman's "other-worldly journey" or interaction with these spiritual beings is unlike the "possession cuits such as are found in West Africa, Bra "Shamanism: An Archaic and/or Recent System of Beliefs," in Shamanism, ed.

Where you have pure shamanism, ... the shaman is the 'master of spirits.' The spirits work for the shaman; he or she possesses them, rather than the reverse."49 Third, in addition to the power animais, in some shamanistic cultures the spirits of the ancestors are also quite important. In Mongolia, for example, the clan chieftain serves as an intermediary to the "Buumal" ancestor spir its, who reside not in some "other world" but in their proper tombs.50 The work of the shaman himself is the fourth element. In Mongolia, this can involve not only healing, but also Controlling clouds, making lightning, and commanding rain, and thus resembles magie.51 But shamanism is not the same as magie. In shamanism, non-human elements tend to be personalized and even anthropomorphized. "The spirits of humans and animais are essen tially the same."52 Magic, contrariwise, is a technical experience, with a "factual, mechanistic conceptual domain of its own."53 The fifth component closely connected in the shamanic complex is the memo rization of certain texts (songs, myths), the rules for ritual activities, and the ru brics for the use of the objects, tools, and paraphemalia used by shamans.54 Among this paraphemalia are antlers, used in shaman's masks.55 Masks are an essential element of shamanism.56 In most shamanic cultures, the masks represent the animal spirits and enhance the connection with them.57 Mongolian shamans of the Genghis Khan period, however, wore ant lers in their headwear as a symbol of the struggle against Buddhism.58 Among modem East Mongolian shamans, the number of antlers shows the healing capacity achieved by the particular shaman.59 Other shamans wore Harner, "Ancient Wisdom," 15.

Miller II trates many of these in the Seymour Gitin festschrift.68 The function of these masks was always unclear.69 Reichert thought they were used in ritual dances, as seems to have been the case in Cyprus, repre senting "divine radiation" (göttlicher Strahlenglcmz).70 Those from Hazor, Ki tion, Enkomi, Korioun, and Sarepta were all found in or near sacred areas.71 Theriomorphic deer masks, with real antlers attached, are worn for dances by the Yaqui and Mayo people of northern Mexico.72 Lucian says that ritual masks were used in the Attis cult at Syrian Hier apolis (DeaAssyr., 15). Herodotus records their use in Egypt (II, 122). A Be set mask is depicted on a female Sau, or healer, from a 17ü,-century BC tomb near the Ramesseum.73 Also in the tomb was a box containing médical pa pyri.74 A block from a 24lh-century BC tomb from Giza depicts a procession of young dancers, scourged by a youth or a dwarf in a Bes mask,75 similar to 19,h-century BC painted canvas Bes masks found in a house at Kahun.76 Incense burners and their stands were quite common in Iron I Israel. Most "biblical archaeologists" automatically relate these to "offering the pleasing odor of incense to the Lord" (Exod 29:25; 29:41; Lev 1:9, 13, 17; 16:12; etc.). It is possible these incense burners have nothing to do with re ligion - incense with hot coals underneath can provide a lot of smoke for many hours or days to repel mosquitoes and other insects.77 Yet the stands' décoration suggests they are religious. Ethnographically, they seem best suited for use in "smudging," cleansing places, persons, or objects of nega tive spiritual energies and inviting benevolent spirits.78 Smudging is a key 68 Two antlers and a mask (the nose and part of the eye socket opening next to the bridge of the nose) were found in the 2009 season of excavation of LBIIb Beth Shemesh, although these have not yet been published; Dale Manor, personal communication. 69 Reichert, "Kultmaske," 195. 70 Reichert, "Kultmaske," 196.

In Mongolia, each shaman has his own complex recipe for the burning material.80 Common burning materials for smudging worldwide include ar temisia (wormwood), which was abundant in the Judean Desert, Foothills of Samaria, and Piain of Sharon in the Iron I period, and most importantly ju niper (broomtree), which in Iron I grew in the Foothills of Samaria, the Piain of Sharon, and the Southern Nablus Syncline.81 Juniper (Mong. arca) is the essential smudging fuel in Mongolian shamanism for purification of the small votive figurines called "Ongons."82 In other shamanistic societies, like the Hmong of Thailand, incense burners are regularly kept in private homes.83 There is evidence for similar uses of incense in the ancient Near East. In cense was used in Egypt to fumigate the Uraeus of Medinet Habu as a means of purification.84 When Pi-Ankhi conquered Memphis, he purified the city by burning incense in it.85 Papyrus Smith describes smudging with cntyw res in and sntr resin incense to cure a woman of delayed menstruation.86 In Mesopotamia, the term for incense in général is qutrinnu, from the 97.9 (2001): 20-22; Tarrell A.

Ii gal Ii gal la) was commonly used to purify (along with reed and tamarisk, both of which grew in Iron I Israel).90 Thus, they play an important role in the mis pî ritual for "enlivening" a new statue of a god.91 Although Dick's translation refers to a "censer of juniper,"92 the instructions that call for "heaped in cense" (Sum. na-de3 si ga)93 suggest the "censer" could be an incense stand or bowl (Sum. nigna; Akk maksütu). So-called "censers," again incense stands, are kept at the head of beds in private homes, as in the Neo-Assyrian (and later) Maqlu rituals, asafetida is burned on one by the bed of the sick person.94 A Neo-Assyrian exorcism ritual describes a censer for juniper in the same position.95 But large statues are not the only items consecrated by juniper smudg ing. Dick's publication of a Neo-Sumerian text from Nippur CBS 8241 in the University of Pennsylvania Museum provides for purification/ dedication of "seven statuettes" (line 24) with "great juniper" (line 4), reed, cedar, and myrtle.96 Other items purifïed by qutâru include drums and bells.97 Nielsen, Incense, 27.

Humans, dogs, horses (there are no Egyptian or Canaanite horse gods; the nearest are Hittite100), bulls, and geese are all represented, with a slight preference for human women. As small as these figurines are, their affinity is to the shaman's "ongons," among which the wolf and goose are common according to the Mongolian ethnographie rec ord.101 Archaeologically, human women figurines are prévalent in Mon golian shaman graves.102 Bird and human forms are most common in the closely-related Siberian shamanism, although the wolf or dog is also known.103 In societies with shamans, "ordinary people as well as shamans carried charms and amulets for protection against spirits, disease, and mis fortune," including "fabricated talismans include[ing] small figures carved from wood, ivory, and stone."104 In Mongolia, reports of religion of the 12,h 13th centuries speak not only of the shaman's ongons but also of domestic gods, house-gods.105 It would be nice if there were some Iron I Israélite drawn iconography to add to the équation; there is not. It would be most interesting to compare such iconography with the Neuropsychological (N-P) Model for the mental imagery of shamanistic trance, developed from clinical and ethnographie data.106 The N-P Model identifies a mixture of entoptic and iconic images as présent in many, but not all, shamanistic contexts.107 This refers to a mix ture of iconic animal and human stick figures with grids, parallel lines, dots, zigzag lines, nested catenary curves, and filigrees - see Fig. 5.

This dichotomy between pottery-only tombs, isolated or urban, and city graves with higher numbers of artifact types ("NAT") could have any number of reasons - cultural or social.

It is, in fact, difficult to separate the two, and it is probably not even possible to define valid variables for classification."128 Moreover, hunting, fishing, and herding in the outfield have to "be ex plained within the framework of the agricultural Settlements."129 The men and boys involved in these tasks "must also have had ways of becoming more familiar with the landscape and taking it into use."130 The "outfield," the landscape beyond the settlement's immédiate environs, be comes subjected to "cognitive control."131 The red- and fallow-deer, moun tain gazelle, and hare hunting made most areas familiar to men, but the grazing in the Evergreen Oak forests of the Foothills of Samaria and the Aleppo Pine Forest of the Southern Nablus Syncline, the hay mowing on the mires of Marj Sanur, and other activities necessitated a good cognitive con 124 Elihu Grant, People of Palestine (Philadelphia: J.B.

Miller II biblical intimations of the use of masks, incense, etc. in the shamanistic manners described above and shown for the ancient Near East? Second, is there broader evidence in the Hebrew Bible for shamanism as a phenome non, for ideas and images that accord with shamanic societies, focusing on the five elements of shamanism ouüined previously? The first run at the Bible, then, can be dealt with quite briefly. On the use of masks, incense, small figurines, and simple inhumation, the Bible is rather terse. "The Hebrew Bible does not immediately reflect religious and ritual practices of the average Israélite of the first millennium BCE," and far less the late second millennium."142 Not only are we dealing primarily with later texts, but with texts that often address populär ritual customs for po lemical or subversive reasons.143 For incense, the noun, trew + qe is associated with a verbal form in the piel and hiphil, the basic meaning of which is "to let ascend in smoke."144 There are a couple of texts that hint at a médicinal or at least apotropaic use of it. In Numbers 16, Aaron stops the plague when he places himself be tween the dead and the living with a burning censer, although clearly there is no law prescribing what to do in this situation.145 More interesting is the prohibition in Exod 30:37-38 against using the recipe for holy incense for private purposes, indicating there were profane uses of trew + qe, too.146 In Prov 27:9, incense is said to be pleasing to the human heart.147 There is an old suggestion, going back to Hugo Gressmann, that the tera phim were masks.148 Karl van der Toorn, in his 1990 treatment of teraphim, discounts this connection since Syro-Palestinian masks are found in mortu ary and temple contexts, not domestic settings.149 Van der Toorn's strong distinction between cuit and home were sufficient reason to dismiss the masks proposai. The teraphim are a complicated issue beyond the scope of this présentation, but "teraphim's occurrence in positive and negative texts that both group teraphim with other tools of divination make it likely that 142 Thomas Römer, "Competing Magicians in Exodus 7-9," in Magic in the Biblical World, ed.

As for masks, Raz Kletter has suggested that Micah's maseka in Judg 18:17-18, weighing in at a mere six pounds, was a mask (or a métal coating for the peseZ).153 Finally, a song like Judges 5 and the Bible's général lack of mythic "hylo phobia" (fear of the wild outdoors) may represent the kind of "naming and taming" of the landscape employed by early Israélite pastoralists.154 The use of illustrative material from nature in the Psalms and in the wisdom litera ture suggests that Israélite culture saw nature as controllable and safe.155 But such matters move us into the conceptual realm. There is broad evidence in the Hebrew Bible for shamanism as a phe nomenon made up of a constellation of ideas and images, particularly the five elements of shamanism outlined previously. These are animism, power animais, ancestor spirits, healing and other quasi-magic, and rubrics for the use of shamanic paraphernalia. We will turn shortly to the biblical text, but "the Hebrew Bible itself is of course a critique on earlier forms of religion, its own roots included."156 Not that "biblical religion" involves shamanism, but rather that Israélite religion of the early Iron Age did. If that is the case, shamanism will emerge in "tid bits of information ... often given in ideologically unguarded moments."157 We then have "the ability to pass, on the basis of dues, ... apparently negli 152 153 154 156 157 Shawn W.

Miller II gible détails [that] could reveal profound phenomena of great importance, ... directly from the known to the unknown."158 But there is more. That earlier form of religion, "Iron Age religion in Palestine" was very similar to the religion of Ugarit.159 The Bible shows striking similarities in ritual vocabulary (salamüma, madbihu, etc.), cultic ar chitectural vocabulary (bt, qds, etc.), cultic prohibitions (dog, pig, wild ani mais), purity requirements,160 metaphors for the divine,161 psalmody (e.g., KTU 1.119 = RS 24.266; CTA 30 = KTU 1.65), and mythic content.162 For this reason, we begin with shamanism in Ugarit as indirect evidence for shamanism in early Israel.163 Animism of sort appears in Ugaritic literature. When Baal has a special message for his wife, he says it is a "word of trees (and a whisper of stone)" (KTU 1.3:III.22-23).164 An incantation tells of men receiving omens from the trees (KTU KTU 1.82:37, 43).165 While there is no evidence for Ugaritic shamans transforming into ani mais, the more important deities occasionally transform themselves into ox en - both El (KTU 1.12:1.4-8) and Baal (KTU 1.5:V).166 But there are also numerous other theriomorphic lesser deities; some who attend Baal's housewarming party include rams, ewes, oxen, and cows (KTU 1.4:VI.47-50; cf. KTU 1.12:II.28-30).167 There are deities indistinguishable from real eagles in Keret that king Dan'el sees hovering over his son (KTU 1.13.8; 1.18:IV.21, Carlo Ginzburg, Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method (Baltimore: Johns Hop kins University Press, 1989), 124-25.

Alongside the namtar/shimtu order maintained by Enlil and the king, there is me/partsu order, "the unchanging ways in which the world of man and things is supposed to be." This is the pur view of Enki and of the ashipu incantation specialist, working by sympathetic magic.

KTU 1.107). Horon occurs in the theophorous name Nrwh db (found on a 7th-century Hebrew seal published over a Century ago.181 It is also in the place-name Nrwh-tyb, as Albright showed from the orthography of Shishak's listing of the city.182 It is either Beit cUr el-Foqa or Beit cUr et-Tahta, both of which were occupied in Iron I and are in the middle of the Iron I Israélite highland settlement.183 This place, "Temple of Horon," stands alongside such sites as Beth Shemesh (see note 70, above) and Beth Yerah. These are ail "chthonic" gods, "the Urgöt ter, the primordial powers who personify the substance of the universe."184 They are frequently the ones invoked for quasi-magical purposes.185 Nothing could be more shamanic. The last named one above, Yerah, is the so-called moon-god Yarih. He fea tures in KTU 1.114, a text about El getting drunk that ends in a prescription for hangovers. Yarih assumes the form of a dog and moves about under the ta ble while El is hosting a feast for the gods.

"Such a sélection can obviously not be comprehensive and does not take in all parts of the Bible, but I think that the excerpts are reasonably représentative of the range of ideas and perspectives ... in the Bible."191 The Bible présents a polemic view of non-normative Yahwism. Highly criticized, for example, are the bâmôt, in which "They burn incense" (2 Kgs 17:11). The bämöt of the Deuteronomistic History are all man-made and specifically "in cities," as Lisbeth Fried has shown.192 But in Akkadian and Ugaritic, the term refers to open country, to the "flanks of the earth" or hill sides, which is what its etymology suggests.193 Who knows what animistic steppe religion lies behind the later texts?194 And yet, "Writing the Biblical texts, the authors did not intend to cancel the religious and ideological past of their people, but they wanted to pro vide the 'right' way of interpreting it."195 So we do not have to only postu late a theoretical Canaanite layer behind sanitized texts. For example, how, theologically, can one adjure someone "by the gazelles or the does of the field" (Song of Songs 2:7; 3:5; 8:4 LXX)?196 God himself has various theriomorphic characteristics. In Num 23:22 and 24:8, he had "the horns [tw^pwt] of a wild ox" when he brought his people out of Egypt.197 He is repeatedly connected with bulls and bull calves, by both Aaron and Jeroboam. In Genesis 49, he is the "Mighty One of Jacob," }abîr yacäqöb - }abîr being a word that is frequently used of bulls and in Ugaritic means "bull" (t/T 3.39). In Hos 12:2, Hosea laments the worship of "Bull El," swr 'l, which can be compared with the association of the bull Peter Β.

Miller II with El and Baal at Ugarit, and Hyksos scarabs with Yaqub-BacaLl9S There is a sense in the Hebrew Bible that the universe is spiritual, that it is an illustration of the divine (Psalm 18; Arnos 5:8).199 Nature is a symbol for spiritual life (Psalm l).200 The earth is a source for truth, and the heav ens for righteousness (Ps 85:8-14). As Ellen Davis notes, "Humans are bound to the earth in an integrity that is biological, moral, and spiritual."201 Noting texts that State that the Sabbath year is emphatically both "for Yahweh" (Lev 25:4) and "for the land" (Lev 25:5), and similar passages, Davis con cludes, "the whole land is imbued with the holiness that dérivés from God's sanctuary."202 Raymond Person has noted Deuteronomy's concern for pollu tion of the "good land."203 The bloodguilt of a homicide committed in open country must be purged by the sacrifice of a heifer in the nearest town. We should abandon vestiges of the mid-20th Century "history vs. nature" schol arship that the nonhuman world was of secondary concern to the biblical authors.204 Animais and humans are made from the same material, says the Yahwist, and not only because both are from the dust of the earth but be cause both are nepes hayyâ (Gen 2:7, 19).205 But more than this, nature is strangely anthropomorphized, especially in the Psalms, with the singing hills and clapping rivers (Ps 19:1; 50:6; 69:34; 98:8).206 Nature can be directly commanded (Psalm 148), and is so in the only two quotations attributed to the Book of Jashar: "O sun, stand still at Gibeon, Ο moon, in the valley of Aijalon," orders Joshua; "O mountains of Martin Rose, "Names of God in the Old Testament," Anchor Bible Dictionary 4: 1004-1011; Korpel, Rift in the Clouds, 536-37.

This mysterious tree reappears in Gen 35:2-4 as a place where "all the foreign gods" are buried and in Deut 11:30, as a focal point for Isra élite migration.215 Does the oak belong to a teacher or is the tree the teach er?216 In Judg 9:37, the oak of note in Shechem is called "Soothsayer's Oak," }elôn më'ônënîm. Paul Haupt noted that môrê in Ethiopie means "diviner."217 Heb. më'ônënîm is a PPlel from the stem of cyn, eye, and of the same seman tic field as rô'ê and hôzê, "seers."

Miller II God repeatedly appears at oak trees in the patriarchal narratives (Gen 12:6; 13:18; 18:1).219 Most curious of trees is the "not-burning" bush of Exo dus 3, the sënê. Deut 33:16 refers to God as "the one dwelling in the bush."220 The possibility of an ancestor cult in ancient Israel has been extensively debated and is beyond the scope of this essay. It is usually the clan chief in Mongolian shamanism who invokes the Buumal ancestral spirits, just as Saul invokes Samuel's ghost.221 The next element of shamanism is the healing and miracle-working pow er of the shaman himself. The Bible is rieh in terms for specialists in "mag ie" and divination: traço?? (Mal 3:5), ιηιπ (Ps 58:6), D'tshjj Q?C] (Isa 3:3), Dopa (Ezek 12:24), etc. Thomas Römer illustrâtes that while D rigorously forbids all such things, Ρ assumes in Exodus that Pharaoh's magicians have actual power, which is almost indistinguishable from Aaron's.222 Devout Israélites appeal to divination throughout the narrative books of the Hebrew Bible: Rebecca consults oracles to learn she carries feuding twins (Gen 25:22 26).223 Dreams, lots (Josh 7:16-26; 1 Sam 10:17-24), and Urim and Thum mim are consulted. Mike Money has interpreted Jacob as a shaman. His ladder dream "satis fies the eestatie half of the shamanic criteria."224 He uses "sympathetic mag ie" to color Laban's sheep, he wrestles with a demigod and is partially dis membered.225 He even dispossesses Laban of his teraphim.226 In the bizarre mini-scene that follows, "Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them he said, 'This is God's camp!'" (Gen 32:1-2). More commonly, the prophets have been linked with shamanism. The debates over the role of eestatie trance in Israélite prophecy go back to Mowinckel, Lindblom, Wheeler Robinson, and Rowley.227 In a fortheoming 219 Hiebert, Yahwist's Landscape, 109.

Instead of returning to ecstasy, he notes both shamans and biblical prophets as war leaders, in ambiguous relationships with the government, in conflict with similar practitioners, and whose "prophecies" are subject to ex tensive literary development.228 Let us be even more specific. Shamans frequently provide their "call nar ratives."229 In Mongolia, an element of this call is the shaman's reluctance to accept it (cf. Exod 3:11-4:13; Jer 1:6; Isa 6:5).230 Many of the prophet's "prophétie acts" or "visual aids" look like sympathetic magic (smashing pots, wearing yokes, etc.).231 Grabbe notes that, "The Israélite prophets most resembling the tradi tional shaman are Elijah and Elisha, who control the weather (1 Kgs 17:1; 18:1, 41-45; Mongolian shamans are known for this232), make miraculous journeys (1 Kgs 18:46), conjure food from nowhere and heal and raise the dead (1 Kgs 17; 2 Kgs 4), and even recover lost objects (2 Kgs 6:l-7)."233 Eli jah is "fed by ravens, well known in the shamanistic world as bearer of mag ic medicine."234 The text describes him as a "Lord of Hair," Ίνψ not wearing a garment of haircloth but perhaps a bearskin, or himself hairy as a bear.235 In Mongolia, "Shamanic clothing is inherited from one shaman to the next,"236 and Elisha takes up Elijah's mantle. Elisha can call up a révélation with proper musical accompaniment (2 Kgs 3:11-20; typical of Central 235 236 mon Β.

He parts the Jordan (2 Kgs 2), purifies Jericho's spring with sah (2 Kgs 2:19-22), pro duces a pool for thirsty troops (2 Kgs 3:12-20), purifies poisoned broth (2 Kgs 4:38-41; a skill of Mongolian shamans240), causes an axe head to float in the Jordan (2 Kgs 6:1-7), and has Naaman healed in the Jordan (2 Kgs 5:1 14).241 Elisha's bizarre cursing of the taunting boys revolves around their taunt of "Bald Head" (2 Kgs 2:23-25), a contrast with the hairiness of Eli jah,242 and their slaughter by two hairy bears, typical shaman's beasts.243 A Lapp "Shaman, when angry, might transform his spirits into wolves or bears, and if he wished, he threw the transformed spirits at others."244 As Patrick Arnold paraphrases, "Cursing the rascals with his shamanic power, Elisha summons his spirit-animals from the woods; two she-bears roar out of the forest and maul the youthful miscreants."245 The bones of Elisha even work miracles after his death, like those of a shaman (2 Kgs 13:21).246 Both Elijah and Elisha are described as 'is 'elohim (1 Kgs 17:18, 24; 2 Kgs 1:9-13; 2 Kgs 4:1-9, 38-33; 5:26-27; 6:6-10; 8:7-13; etc.). Elisha has this title more than anyone eise in the Bible does.247 Gangloff equates the title with "paranormal healer."248 The term 'is 'elohim occurs in Ugarit as ins Um, where it désignâtes deified deceased kings.249 Just before God is said to live in a bush, Deuteronomy 33 (ν 1) calls Moses, another wielder of sympa 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 V.

The teraphim were discussed above. They are frequently mentioned along side the ephod (Judg 18:14-20; Hos 3:4). Its identification is also problem atic; at the least, it was both a special garment and a ritual object. Refer ences outside the priestly texts may not refer to a physical item identical with Aaron's ephod, but perhaps we should take seriously Exodus 28 = 39, which makes it "an apronlike garment, suspended from waist level down ward and kept in place by Shoulder pieces or straps; it probably completely encircled the lower body."254 Essential to Mongolian shaman's regalia is "an apron which consists of tapering strips about 80 cm. (32 inches) long hang ing down from a band about 20 cm. (8 inches) wide."255 Exod 18:6 speaks of "ephod of gold, of blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and of fine twined lin en, skillfully worked," and the Mongolian cérémonial apron is "twenty-one strips which are subdivided in the colours of the rainbow."256 The apron is central to shamanic costumes among most Altaic peoples.257 But what most resembles the "magical" rituals of the ancient Near East are the purity laws of the Pentateuch.258 The Mesopotamian Namburbi texts are very close to the ritual procédures for dealing with cases of suspected 250 Johnson Teng Kok Lim, The Sin of Moses and the Staff of God (Studia Semitica Neerlandica 35; Assen: Van Gorcum, 1997), 163. 251 John Van Seters, Life of Moses (Kampen: Kok Pharos, 1994), 357; E.

The archaeological évi dence for religion can best be explained within the constellation of practices and expériences of shamanism. Vestiges of such a religion are plentiful in the Hebrew Bible.263 259 Cryer, "Magic in Ancient Syria-Palestine," 137. 260 Cryer, "Magic in Ancient Syria-Palestine," 137. 261 Cryer, "Magic in Ancient Syria-Palestine," 142. 262 Alan Lenzi, Secrecy and the Gods (Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2008), 275, 279-88, 303-304. 263 On the theological implications of this sub-current for modem metaphysics, see the as-yet unpublished essay "The Trinity in Mesopotamian Perspective" by Giorgio Buccellati.</page><page sequence="31">Shamanism in Early Israel 339 Figure 1.
