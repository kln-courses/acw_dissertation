<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS DECADENCE: THE STRANGE LIFE OF AN EPITHET. By Richard Gilman. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1979. 180 p. The subject of this book holds much that could be interesting and important to students of comparative literature, literary criticism, and the history of ideas. Unfortunately the author knows very little about it, and what he has desultorily gleaned he has naively presented, through an argument which moves from free association to sweeping generalization in a loosely impressionistic style. "Ignorant of history ... as well as of language"-thus he puts down a remark by Kenneth Tynan, a fellow drama critic whose credentials in both areas may well be sounder than those exhibited here. That attempted put-down turns out to be a boomerang. Why, then, should attention be paid any further? Precisely because the book is calculated to get more public attention than most of the other books reviewed in CL, because it has been sponsored by trade publishers generally respected for the quality of their list, and because it has already made some impression on critics who know even less about the subject. Had it been submitted to a university press, the usual process of consultation with experts would probably have rejected it outright, or else made sure that the author would do his neglected homework and revise his manuscript into coherent form. The avowed intention of Richard Gilman is to "restore" the "history" of the word he has more or less focussed upon. That he has characterized it as an epithet may suggest an underlying bias against it, which sometimes threatens to turn an intellectual inquiry into an emotional diatribe. He himself inclines to be a habitual coiner of epithets, for whom Sade becomes "a benefactor" among divers other things, Verlaine "that hectic voluptuary, the impresario of evocation," and Flau- bert's Salammbb "one of the silliest, most indigestible novels by a writer of genius." But phrases of that sort do not bespeak another impresario of evocation, or do much to illuminate the names that have been dropped in lieu of a more ordered exposition. Nietzsche is cited more than once, and quite pertinently, as an out- standing example of a major writer preoccupied with the problem. Yet no attempt is ever really made to interpret or criticize or indicate the nature of his views. Since this is primarily an essay in definition, Mr. Gilman has consulted diction- aries, though somewhat at random. Medieval rather than classical in its Latin origin, the term has a long history and a French coloration (see Cotgrave's French-English dictionary of 1611). We learn from Littr6 that it was a favorite expression of Bossuet's, Mr. Gilman is entitled to speak for himself in expressing methodological doubts: "To chart movements in language accurately is a hopeless ideal." But this is to ignore the perspicuous success that others have had in tracing the semantic permu- tation of key ideas: notably A. O. Lovejoy on nature or Rene Wellek on baroque (both of those concepts at least as challenging as decadence). The "evidence" has been less elusive than Mr. Gilman implies, whenever the scholar controlled the relevant sequence of texts and was able to set them into their historical contexts. "The archaeology of language is a thin science," we are flatly told. On the con- trary, if such archaeologizing means the study of etymology, it is-as Proust attested-extraordinarily rich. What looks thin is Mr. Gilman's selection of ex- amples. These, in a preliminary survey or rather sampling, range sporadically and haphazardly from quasi-official pronouncements by Verlaine or Villiers de 1'Isle-Adam to casual journalistic misconstructions in Variety and Playboy. It should be noted that the opening quotation, cited from Verlaine without more specific reference, has been so typographically garbled that it cannot be checked 285</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE for accuracy of translation. Given the lack of notes, bibliography, index, or other apparatus, it may well stand as a general caveat. A certain measure of skeptical detachment is always called for, to be sure, in dealing with the shifts of meaning and the colors of rhetoric. "A slippery customer, a chameleon"-such are Mr. Gilman's incidental epithets for his epithet par excellence. Granted that its applications have been loaded with value judgments, originally pejorative though occasionally self-approving; these, considered in- dividually, are mere subjective opinions; but the climates of opinion, collectively registered, provide the more objective stuff of history. Their ultimate significance is better comprehended in the light of irony than in the mood of moral indignation. We are doubtless well advised to be on our guard against question-begging metaphors: to be fully aware of how we reify or personify a society when we endow it with organic or anthropomorphic traits. The body politic is so utterly different from an individual human body that our surmises about its development or decay put a willful strain upon that analogy. Yet Mr. Gilman's quotation marks seem to concede that he is straining a point, when he refers to the ancient sense of belatedness as a "'mistake' of the classical world." If that was what many of the ancients believed, right or wrong, it was an integral part of the record- Nobody needed to wait for Valery's announcement, in the aftermath of the First World War: "Nous autres, civilisations, nous savons maintenant que nous sommes mortelles." Mr. Gilman adduces Oswald Spengler, who has indeed been discredited as an ideologue of cultural decline. He overlooks the stronger testi- mony of Arnold Toynbee, whose morphology of obsolescent cultures is more thoroughly documented and less doctrinaire. He recognizes the idea of progress as a counterweight to the idea of decadence, but sees in it a kind of afterthought. It may seem so because man's earlier hopes for the future had been sublimated into otherworldly preconceptions. The explicit confrontation between voices of the past and of the present, crystallizing attitudes toward both in the Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes, has been altogether ignored. Mr. Gilman's chapter on the Greco-Roman world echoes a few recent historians. It might have been more convincing, if less convenient for his thesis, if he had cited such first-hand authori- ties as Tacitus and Suetonius. A rare glance at source material, however, may prompt a misleading inference, such as the assumption that Roman comedy shows hostility toward the Greeks. Since all its extant plays are fabulae palliatae, where virtually all the characters are Greek, no conclusions can meaningfully be drawn. Gibbon, who is mentioned in passing, earns perhaps the most condescending of Mr. Gilman's epithets: "that novelist struggling with the most serious demands of the historian's profession." Incredibly, there is no mention whatsoever of the specific work that did more than any other to establish the concept and raise the issue, Montesquieu's Considdrations sur les causes de la grandeur des romains et de leur dicadence. An omission of comparable importance, which may be less obvious to readers and therefore a more serious evasion of responsibility, is ttudes de mweurs et de critique sur les podtes latins de la decadence. There the classicist, Desire Nisard, transferred the emphasis from history to literature by comparing the Roman writers of the Silver Age with the emergent French romanticists. It was an inept comparison for Victor Hugo and La Jeune France, yet it would prove more congenial to Baudelaire and the following generation. Mr. Gilman does speak, within a brief parenthesis, of "a shabby, disreputable, but well-known 1898 tome," Max Nordau's Degeneration. Though the dating is wrong (it was 1892) and the phrasing is crude, the adjectives are appropriate: this influential polemic against the fin du sikcle had camouflaged its basic philistinism as pseudo-science (and would be effectively counterattacked by Bernard Shaw). 286</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS "Decadence is a word that ought to be definitively banished from history." This statement, taken out of context from Renan, carries broader implications than he intended when expressing professional misgivings over the historian's use of moralistic terms. Historical background is all too frequently skewed by facile generalizations: e.g., that the French Revolution undermined classical values in art (David ? Talma ? La Harpe? Pindare-Lebrun?). Comparatists would like to see textual evidence for the alleged French appreciation of Blake or Keats during the nineteenth century. Beau Brummell was expatriated to France, not as a pro- ponent of dandyism, but as an unkempt fugitive from his debts. English suspicion of French yellowbacks derived not so much from "exotic French novels" as from naturalistic ones: Charpentier's Zola rather than the Mercure de France's symbo- lists. One might have thought that Huysmans had clearer affinities with Mallarme than with Poe; and it is boggling to have the neutral title A Rebours flagrantly translated as Against Nature. Nor can an interpretation be justified which regards the decadentism of Baudelaire as a posthumous reading through the eyes of Gautier. The very passage rendered (incorrectly) from Gautier's preface to Les Fleurs du rmal imitates the tone of Baudelaire's own impressions (quoted later) of Poe, "la phosphorescence de la pourriture et la senteur de l'orange." "Baudelaire once described himself in a wonderful image as 'a bell with a crack,' " Mr. Gilman tells us. "Is it too clever to think of the bell as his poetic voice and the crack as his sinful humanity ?" We are happily spared the embarrass- ment of answering so rhetorical a question. It is a common and pardonable error to superimpose an otiose accent aigu on Remy de Gourmont, or even to prefix- like Ezra Pound--an otiose particule to the unaccompanied surname. But a critic's professed concern for verbal discrimination should cause him to think twice before using the adjective macho, with its Hispanic and sexist overtones, to describe the Victorian attitude toward the condemnation of Oscar Wilde. Stylistic imprecision leads into a limbo of factual misapprehension, when the Baudelairean themes are truculently declared to be "precisely those that attracted a type of inexperienced Anglo-Saxon mind [George Moore's !] to the French." After his distant nod to the classics, Mr. Gilman touches mainly upon the modern Anglo-French sphere. Some of the intervening episodes, which he rather cavalierly ignores, might have profit- ably been brought into the picture. It would have been illuminating to note the Renaissance's preoccupation with the decay of nature, along with its fruition, which became highly vocal in England through the Goodman-Hakewill contro- versy, and found a literary refutation inter alia among the youthful Latin exercises of Milton. Mr. Gilman has been somewhat erratic in choosing--or disregarding-the secondary works on which he so largely depends (relying too much, for instance, on Philippe Julian's [sic] gossipy biography of Wilde). One puts his volume down with renewed regret that the late Renato Poggioli did not live to complete his projected study, The Autumn of Ideas, though he did publish two valuable papers on decadence, plus an article in Shipley's Dictionary of World Literary Terms which could have furnished Mr. Gilman with some useful bibliographical hints. One also turns away with feelings of enhanced respect for Matei Calinescu's recent Faces of Modernity: Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch-another study that Mr. Gilman has, to his detriment, ignored. In less than half of his compass, a single chapter in a book that covers a good deal of further ground and plots interrelationships, Professor Calinescu has managed to organize and present a much fuller, more lucid, more suggestive, and more reliable analysis and critique. Forthcoming, one may also look forward to the collection of essays edited by Malcolm Bradbury, Decadence a~nd the Nineties, which should be well worth 287</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE reading if it comes up to the standard set by his Penguin symposium on modernism. Decadence has revealed itself, in any case, as a theme that can be seriously pursued as well as insouciantly exploited. HARRY LEVIN Harvard University</page></plain_text>
