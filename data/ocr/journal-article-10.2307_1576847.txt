<plain_text><page sequence="1">DOCUMENT Delusions of Dialogue: Control and Choice in Interactive Art Jim Campbell hese days more and more artists are using computers to create artworks. I would like to discuss here the relationship of the structure of the computer and what has been called "interactive art." Although understanding this structure is clearly not relevant to viewing art that incorpo- rates a computer, I believe that some understanding of the way that a computer functions might help us to critically ana- lyze the state of the art and examine why the art has so clearly not reached the level of transcending the technology (Fig. 1). A computer can be thought of as an empty structure into which a concept is inserted. The concept-which must be represented in a mathematical way-is the program, which is made up of a series of algorithms that define the response of the system. Data is input, and the program reacts and pro- duces an output selected from the vocabulary of that particu- lar system. That output could be an image, a sound, a robot thatjumps up and down or a change in room lighting. These outputs all represent the internal direction of the program. I find it useful to put interactive work on a dynamic spec- trum with controllable systems on one end and responsive sys- tems on the other. In controllable systems the actions of the viewer correlate 1-to-i to the reactions of the system. Interac- tive CD-ROMs are controllable systems and so, generally speaking, are games. In responsive systems the actions of the viewer are interpreted by the program to create the response of the system. Artificial life artworks fit at the extreme end of this side of the spectrum. This spectrum is fuzzy and often subjective and, more importantly, changes with a person's technological proficiency. If a work is responding in a predict- able way and the viewers become aware of the correlation be- tween their actions and the work's response to their actions, then they will feel that they are in control, and the possibility of dialogue is lost. The first time I walked through an auto- matic door at the supermarket I thought the door was smart and was responding to me. Now I step on the mat to open the door on purpose. The point is that often the first time an in- terface is experienced it is perceived as being responsive, but if the interface is experienced again it becomes controllable. The second time it is not a question but a command. It is very hard to avoid the theme of control in computer art because computers are fundamentally designed to be con- trolling devices. The computer industry's goal of making computers and programs smarter is simply to make comput- ers more efficient at being controlled by the user to get a job done. Why should they do anything else? This is generally what we want computers for: we want them to be passive slaves. One can see this in the software, hardware and inter- faces that are currently being used. This model is fine until it collides with art. For example, let us look at the concept of icons as interface de- vices. Icons are designed to be precise and accurate and dis- crete-on or off. They are de- signed to present a closed set of possibilities. They are not ca- pable of subtlety, ambiguity or question. An interface of choice and control makes sense for a word processor, an information retrieval system or a game, but not as a metaphor for inter- activity or dialogue. ABSTRACT The author discusses the re- lationship of interactive art to the structure of the computer, in par- ticular commenting on artists' choices in using different kinds of systems, programs and interface devices. He discusses the prob- lems inherent in the reduction of an artist's concept to a math- ematical representation, a trans- formation that is necessary to al- low a work to be implemented on a computer. Discussing the poten- tial of the computer to allow a work to be able to change and grow over time through the ex- traction and storage of informa- tion, he looks for new, untouched directions for interactive art. I have often wondered why most interactive work feels con- trived and designed for a calculated response, like bad art- school art. I have seen so many CD-ROMs and interactive video discs that made me feel like my interaction was com- pletely scripted and predetermined within the pretext of a few choices. A painter can create a painting without con- sciously thinking about future viewers, and a filmmaker can create a film without being overly affected by predicting the audience's response, but it is almost impossible for an artist creating an interactive work to avoid trying to second-guess the viewer. How else can an artist design an interface without seeing it from the other side? One of the ways that artists can avoid this problem is to consider it from the point of view of the work itself, rather than trying to put themselves in the viewer's shoes. Instead of saying, "as viewer, what can I trig- ger?," why not say, "as program, what can I measure?" and then, "What can I reflect and what can I express based on some interpretation of the viewer's responses?" This way the work becomes a momentary but dynamic reflection of a thinking process. Because the artist does not write the viewer's side of the interaction, the viewer can respond in a more open way. One of the consequences of this approach is that the work, like a painting and like a film, exists on its own. There is no "attract" mode. The work is not waiting for a person to com- plete it. In a way, the work becomes interactive not with people but with its environment. This is particularly impor- tant with work that exists in a public space.

A simplified diagram of the structure of a computer. degree to which a work feels like an an- swer instead of a question, is the choice of the artist and not a limitation of the medium or the technology. THE PROGRAM The program has three main functions: (1) to interpret the sensory input de- vices (the mouse, the keyboard, the mi- crophone, etc.); (2) to control the memory (what to store, what not to store and what to retrieve); and (3) to select and control a response based on the interpretation of the sensory devices and the memories. I press the letter "k" on the keyboard, and a short time later a graphic representation of the letter k appears on the screen. Programs are mathematical represen- tations: they have to be defined math- ematically. This brings interesting ques- tions to the artistic process when an artist is forced to transform a concept, an emotion or an intuition into a logical representation. This is a difficult thing to do without trivializing the original concept. What often happens during this reductive and transformational pro- cess is that the subtlety in the work is lost simply because of the fact that things have to be defined with mathematical precision. A different approach is to start with an idea from technology, and let the work flow from the set of techno- logical possibilities. This avoids the problem of finding a mathematical equivalent by starting with one, but cer- tainly a problem with this approach is that it is difficult to take the work be- yond self-referentiality. Often these works are only about the technology that they use, their processes and effects. Yet another way of avoiding this issue of needing to be precise is to use third- party programs to make the transforma- tion from artist's concept to mathemati- cal representation. This solution incorporates a whole new set of prob- lems: the main one being that it is usu- ally the third-party software that be- comes the soul of the work-the "Photoshop effect" in which the soft- ware that is used was written to create the same effects or responses over and over again. Such software becomes not a tool but a palette of clich6 symbols. However, third-party software that is spe- cifically written for a particular work does allow for unique expression in the context of the work, because software is subjective in the transforming process. The way that a program is written has meaningful expression unless the pro- gram is performing a trivial function. For example, there will never be a uni- versal program that truly understands a sentence, because sentence comprehen- sion clearly has a subjective element to it. Any sentence comprehension pro- gram will exhibit the biases of its pro- grammer within its interpretations. There is no good way of defining what a program is. A program might be de- scribed mathematically as a series of al- gorithms that choose a new state based on the current state, the past states and the current set of inputs. In this defini- tion, a program has direction. Using an anthropomorphic analogy one might say that a program controls its own time by responding to its senses. It has motiva- tion. Another aspect of a program is that it is completely invisible to the viewer. The viewer can only infer meaning from the program. This trait of invisibility is where the power of illusion lies, and in- visibility associated with direction or mo- tivation is the combination of character- istics that cause us to project attributes of life onto or into a computer. It is difficult for viewers not to project intelligence into a program that has "meaningful" re- sponses to their actions. I did an experiment a while ago to try to show how the simplest of meaningless processes could be combined to imply meaning. I created a second cursor on the computer screen that acted like a shadow of the regular cursor. I then added delay to this second cursor and noise to its coordinate position on the screen. The result was as though this sec- ond, shadow cursor were following the first cursor around, as if it were alive. The simplest interpretation would sug- gest that delay implies thinking and that adding randomness to delay implies vo- lition. Of course there was no life, there was only the sum of some meaningless characteristics of life. The characteristic of following may be a characteristic of something alive, but it is also a charac- teristic of the behavior of a meaningless computer algorithm. We are still in the illusion stages of computer technology. I have wondered what the extrapolation of the willing suspension of disbelief will mean in our relationship to computers. Expressive meaning within the pro- gram is an important part of an interac- tive work. During a conversation, a person's words, facial expressions, tone of voice and type of eye contact all point to the ideas and feelings that this person is attempting to communicate. A person's words and behavior provide a window to his or her conscious and sub- conscious ideas, memories and motiva- tions. The underlying aspects of what is going on inside one's head are certainly an important part of what is being com- municated. Analogously, during interac- tion with a computer, the control and display of the images, audio and text by the computer program all point to the hidden aspects of the program itself. I think this happens whether one wants it to or not, simply because the program is responding to the present. If the pro- gram is trivial, then an aspect of the communication will seem trite. Another way to understand why there is meaning within a program is to look at some older mediums. If one is watch- ing a film or looking at a painting, the images that one sees reference the past in a static way. In an interactive work the 134 Campbell, Delusions of Dialogue</page><page sequence="3">images that one sees are dynamically ref- erencing the past. If the new element particular to the medium of film was time, then I think that the new element to interactive art is the present. And it is the program that connects the present to the past. There is one very simple thing that a computer program can do that our minds can not. Flip a coin. The ability of a program to make a truly arbitrary deci- sion, an unmotivated decision, is often used to model many naturally occurring processes, but usually it is an inaccurate model. Typically the only characteristic in common with the process being mod- eled is unpredictability. Irrational behav- ior, for example, is unpredictable, but it is anything but arbitrary. If many irratio- nal interactions occur within a commu- nication, and the actions point to the same set of hidden motivating forces, they will begin to reveal what these mo- tivations are. A number of random ac- tions will point in many different direc- tions, creating nothing but confusion. Unpredictability need not be confusing but can actually be revealing if the right models are used in the programs. Most programs are trivial with ran- domness thrown in to make them seem complex. What this does is make the communication shallow and confusing. SENSORY INPUTS People think of interfaces mainly as a way of getting discrete and accurate in- formation into the computer, because computers process numbers. Input in- terfaces are ways of converting the real world into numbers (digitizing), but the world is continuous, not discrete. Going back to the idea that interactive works can be put on a spectrum from control- lable to responsive, interfaces can be put on a similar spectrum with command on one end and measurement on the other. These usually correspond to discrete in- terfaces on the command end and con- tinuous on the measurement end. Just where an interface fits on this spectrum has as much to do with its perceived structure as with its implementation. For example, if a foot switch is mounted under a carpet near a video monitor, and a viewer walks up to the monitor and steps on the carpet, the switch is closed and triggers an image and sound to start playing on the moni- tor. When the viewer leaves the carpet, the image and sound stop. If the viewer wants to see the image again he or she will step on the carpet. The viewer is not interacting with the image or the pro- gram behind it, but merely with the foot switch. There is no dialogue. It is a dis- crete interface: the switch is on or off; the image is on or off. In a second example, 100 foot switches are mounted in a row under a carpet to create a position detector that measures a viewer's distance from the same video monitor as above. The sys- tem can differentiate 100 possible dis- tances from 0 feet to 20 feet. The image is at maximum brightness, and the sound is at maximum volume when the viewer is 20 feet away, but as the viewer walks closer the image and sound fade, reaching nothing when the viewer is 1 foot away. A viewer will find that the op- timal positions for image intelligibility and sound intelligibility will be differ- ent. Different viewers might respond in any of a number of ways-oscillating be- tween these two optimal positions, find- ing a compromise or prioritizing-but the important point is that their actions will be based on what they are seeing and hearing, not on where their feet are. This example illustrates the funda- mental difference between discrete in- terfaces and continuous ones: namely that in discrete interfaces the interac- tion is between the viewer and the inter- face, and in continuous interfaces the interaction is between the viewer and the work or the program. Even though the above interface is discrete, as all digital representations by definition are, it will be perceived as be- ing continuous because the difference between any two of the 100 levels is im- perceptible. Of course, one could dis- play the distance as a number between 1 and 100 on the screen along with the image, and this would turn the per- ceived continuous interface into a dis- crete one-causing the viewer to inter- act with the number, as with a slider bar on a Macintosh or Windows program. Interfaces that involve discrete choices leave little room for intuition. Discrete choices generally cause the viewers to look for a logical reason to make the cor- rect choice based on what they think the consequences might be. Unless it is a game, there is no correct choice. It has been my experience that intui- tive interaction through an interface can only be possible if that interface is able to understand any input of its type. For example, if the interface to the com- puter is word recognition, then the com- puter should have a reasonable under- standing of anything that might be said to it, not just a few words. If the inter- face to the computer is a distance-mea- suring device then the computer should understand distance in any direction that it is approached from, notjust from straight on. If an interface has holes in it with regard to its structure, then it will be disregarded by a viewer simply as metaphorical, and any interaction that does occur between a viewer and the work will get stuck at the interface. The interaction that occurs will be between the viewer and the interface, not be- tween the viewer and the work or the program, as I suggested earlier with dis- crete interfaces. A transparent interface is a continuous one that is perceivably complete within its type of structure. MEMORY Like the program, the memory in a com- puter is also invisible, even more so be- cause information must travel through the program to get into or out of memory. The process that connects the real world to the internal memory must involve transformation but may or may not involve interpretation. It usually does not. For example, a moving image is stored as a moving image and later is played back as the same moving image. In this case, transformation takes place at the input device, the camera system, by digitizing the image, and at the output device by un-digitizing the image and dis- playing it. This process is simply the re- gurgitation of raw data. This does not have to be the case. The current structure of the computer allows for the possibility of interpreting an input and subse- quently storing this interpretation in memory. The original data need not be stored at all. The potential of the com- puter to be able to extract information from an input and store it, not as raw data but as associated data, is one of the fun- damental characteristics that allows for a work to be able to change and grow with time, even changing its vocabulary along the way. To me this is one of the most ex- citing and unique possibilities in com- puter art, and very little work has been done in this area. The possibilities exist for works that perceivably never repeat themselves. Works that respond to their environment notjust in a short-term way, but in a long-term way, unpredictably and meaningfully (easier said than done). CONCLUSION The difference between an interactive game and an interactive work of art is notjust in the subject matter. It is also in Campbell, Delusions of Dialogue 135</page><page sequence="4">the program and interface, which are important parts of the expression of a work. Artists working with computers will continue to be at odds with the models and directions of the multime- dia industry. Interactive art that uses a computer is still in its developmental stages. The computer is certainly the first medium in history in which the expression of an emotion or a concept has to be reduced to a mathematical form. Probably the only meaningful dialogues that occur while interacting with a work are be- tween the viewers and themselves in the form of feedback systems. The limita- tions that we are up against at this point are no longer technological. Possibly, as we begin to understand more about communication, it will be possible to ex- press not merely a thought of the past, but a thinking process in the present.
