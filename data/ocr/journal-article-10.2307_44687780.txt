Previous tests with a cadaver and a BioSID dummy at the Medical College of Wisconsin confirmed that the dummy does not suitably model the human motion. To further evaluate different ATDs in far- side crashes, MAthematical DYnamic Modeling (MADYMO) was employed. The modeling showed that the motion of a Hybrid III, BioSID, EuroSidl, EuroSID2, or SID2s did not accurately reflect the motion of a human cadaver under the same impact configurations as the cadaver test. The MADYMO human facet model was found to closely reproduce the kinematics of the cadaver test. The effect of varying console designs on occupant kinematics is presented in this paper. The human facet model appears to be a good interim tool for the evaluation of countermeasures in far-side crashes. INTRODUCTION In lateral crashes, the occupant on the non-struck side of the vehicle accounts for a significant portion of automotive fatalities and HARM1 annually. (The authors refer to the occupant on the non-stuck side as the far- side occupant.) All side-impacts generally account for 35% of road trauma. Of these side-impact injuries, those associated with the occupant on the non-struck side of the vehicle account for 40% of HARM (Fildes et al., 2002). Despite these statistics, to date, little research has been directed to an understanding of the mechanism of injury to the far-side occupant. Impacts on the far-side are most commonly characterized by a head injury, followed by extremity and chest injuries (Gabler et al., 2005). The head trauma often comes about from the far-side occupant extending out of the seat and contacting the intruding near-side door (Digges et al., 2005). Due to the nature of side 1 In 1982 and 1985, Malliaris et al. published two papers that developed a technique using (1) occupant count of injuries and (2) cost of an AIS injury to set safety priorities for government and automotive manufacturers. This new approach used fatality information, but incorporated the price tag of the maximum AIS for the survivors of a crash. They entitled this new method as a Harm analysis. impacts, the kinematics of excursion of the far-side occupant is not seen by the near-side occupant. Since most side impact research and regulations are focused on near-side impacts, side-impact dummies are designed to consider injury criteria and biofidelic requirements of near-side hits. These are characterized by broad intruding impacts to one side of the body. Conversely, far-side is marked by excursion out of the seat and towards the point of impact. Typical modern vehicle interior arrangements are limited in the ability to hold the occupant in place during this situation and thus results in upper torso movement and spinal bending. Meanwhile, the occupant usually absorbs near-side impacts in the ribs and hips. The stark differences in these two side-impact scenarios places the suitability of current side-impact ATDs for far-side impact testing into question (Stoloinski et al, 1999). Fildes et al. 2002 reported that the current WorldSID prototype and the BioSID dummy (when fitted with a modified lumbar spine) provide the most reasonable simulations to occupant kinematics and injuries. This study was based on comparison of a Post-Mortem Human Subject (PMHS) and four ATDs: BioSID, BioSID fitted with a lumbar spine modification, EuroSIDI, and WorldSID. Some of the metrics used to evaluate these dummies relative to the PMHS were torso shear, spine straightening, and head impact. The PMHS (on the non- struck side of the simulated vehicle) stretched out to give what would have been a head strike against the stuck- side door. The authors reported that neither the BioSID, EuroSIDI , nor WorldSID reproduced a head strike with the struck-side door as did the PMHS. This paper seeks to further evaluate these dummies and other models by using computer simulations to assess dummy responses in far-side impact scenarios, and evaluate their responses to countermeasures. METHODOLOGY The model work commenced with a previous MADYMO model designed primarily for frontal impacts. It contained a Hybrid III crash test dummy seated inside a full vehicle interior. From this, any vehicle acceleration could be applied linearly in the x, y, or z-axis directions, concurrently with rotational accelerations around the three axes. Contact interactions and force deflection 90</page><page sequence="2">functions between the dummy and vehicle interior were previously defined in the model. After deleting the Hybrid III dummy from the model, the remaining vehicle interior was used as the basis of future simulations with side-impact dummy models. The original model was written in MADYMO Version 5.4 and converted to MADYMO 6.0.1 in XML computer language. All further modeling was conducted in MADYMO 6.0.1 table format. VEHICLE INTERIOR The vehicle interior, loosely based on the geometry of a 1999 Ford Taurus, used mostly ellipsoids to represent interior surfaces. These ellipsoids connected to each other through rigid joints. Planes were used in some locations such as floorboard, dashboard, roof, and seat. The vehicle configuration is pictured in Figure 1. The occupant had on a standard 3-point belt restraint system. Figure 1: Vehicle Interior OCCUPANT MODELS TNO, the supplier of MADYMO code, provides several standard, ready-to-use computer models for vehicle occupants. Of the occupants supplied, the one's chosen for this study were five dummies (Hybrid III, BioSID, EuroSID I, EuroSID II, SID2s) and two humans (human finite element model and human facet model). The authors wanted to include the WorldSID in the simulations. Unfortunately, MADYMO did not have a released WorldSID at the time the simulations were being done. All side-impact occupants were impacted from the right side. All occupants were placed in the driver's seat while the vehicle impact was on the passenger side. INITIAL SETUP After inserting each new dummy into the vehicle interior, two processes needed to be followed to properly setup the models- dummy rest positioning and initial belt positioning. After inserting the dummy into the vehicle model and defining all environmental contact functions, rough dummy positioning was visually achieved through EASi- Crash software. To further specify the correct dummy position, gravity (-9.81 m/s2 linear acceleration in z-axis) was applied to each rigid body of the particular dummy. During dummy seating, no other accelerations or inputs were specified. The model was run for a long duration of time, allowing the dummy to fall to resting position and reach equilibrium with the interior. The final joint positions at equilibrium were taken from the appropriate output file and placed in the model for initial position in the remaining simulations. To position the belts, each end of the lap or shoulder belt was gently accelerated towards its anchor. The dummy was locked in place and made rigid during this process. The process gently contoured the belt around the respective dummy. Due to some of the unique circumstances of far-side impacts for the dummies, several modifications were necessary to best accommodate them to far-side conditions. The following sections detail which modifications were made to the occupant models. MODEL MODIFICATIONS BioSID The BioSID crash dummy, based on a 50th percentile adult male, contains legs, head, and neck similar to Hybrid ill. The BioSID rigid spine supports 6 deformable ribs for near-side impacts. The ribs mount on the left- side for left impacts and right-side for right impacts. This particular model used a right-side dummy to study far- side impacts to the driver. The MADYMO model of the BioSID comes with a non-segmented neck. The MADYMO model needed updating with the current biofidelic segmented neck of the physical BioSID. The updated neck is modeled and contained in the Hybrid III MADYMO model. The authors transplanted the neck from the Hybrid III model into the BioSID model. Updating the BioSID with the new neck created a non-validated model. The authors assumed the redesigned BioSID model to be suitable. The new model used the same underlying code and properties for the Hybrid III segmented neck. This code was copied and inserted to the BioSID model between the same two rigid bodies as the old neck, see Figure 2. The heads are identical in BioSID and Hybrid III and both use a rigid plate between the shoulders for a base.

The updated model maintained the same distance between start and end points. EuroSID I &amp; II Due to this unique application of EuroSID models for far-side impact instead of near-side impact, a challenge arose in developing the seatbelt interactions with the occupant. Typically for near-side impacts, the shoulder seatbelt gets trapped in the shoulder neck region while the dummy contacts the door. For far-side impacts, the upper torso of the human/dummy moves laterally toward the stuck side (the passenger seat), sliding the shoulder belt off the outside shoulder. In the EuroSID MADYMO models, a valley exists between the clavicle ellipsoid and shoulder ellipsoid. In the initial simulations, the seatbelt dropped into this valley to significantly and unnaturally restrain the driver. To correct the grabbing problem, the clavicle ellipsoid was extended laterally for both the EuroSID I and II models to overlap the shoulder ellipsoid and allow the shoulder belt to slide off the shoulder during occupant excursion to the far-side. No other properties of the ellipsoid were changed except the size. Figure 3 shows the original ellipsoid configuration and the modified EuroS I D 's. Figure 3: EuroSID Modified Ellipsoid of the Clavicle SID2S The SID2s, based on the 5th% female, was the only petite-size occupant model evaluated for far-side impacts. The same procedure was followed as with the other models- gravity was used to pull the model into position, and seatbelts were pulled snug over the pelvis and chest. The resulting initial simulations displayed some challenges with the seatbelt and torso interactions. The model, designed for near-side lateral impacts, contains 6 thin ribs for the upper body. When the shoulder belt moved to restrain the ribs, the nodes of the belts fell between the ellipsoids and the shoulder belt acted transparent to the chest. To alleviate the situation, the faceted mesh for the shoulder belt was made twice as fine, thereby creating more nodes closer together and more contact points for the contact of the belt to ellipsoid. HUMAN FINITE ELEMENT The human finite element model released by TNO Automotive is the most detailed and sophisticated of any of the preceding models. Based upon human data, the model uses faceted bone models and layers of finite elements for deformable tissue. The model contains true skeletal and organ geometry. It visually appears as a human. The model begins with the human in a seated position with arms extended forward. Unfortunately, the model is not amenable to taking the human out of this initial setup, and then letting the human sink down into the seat. Therefore, gravity was not used to position the human. The authors simply placed the human in the seat using visual approximations. HUMAN FACETED MODEL A more simplified human occupant model is also released by TNO. This model uses rigid bodies combined with faceted surfaces. Using the pre-defined contact groups, the human was placed in the vehicle interior, and positioned properly. The belts were again contoured around the trunk and pelvis of the occupant. Due to difficulties with two faceted surfaces contacting one another, as with the belts to the faceted human model, ellipsoids were placed underneath the skin facets to improve the belt contact properties. These ellipsoids surrounded the same rigid bodies that the facets do, except they are used for the belt contact surfaces instead of the facets. Ellipsoids were added for the rigid bodies to simulate the pelvis, abdomen, shoulders, and upper arms. Besides the seat belt contacts, these ellipsoids are inconsequential to the rest of the model. Figure 4 shows which ellipsoids were added. Figure 4: Ellipsoids Added for Belt Contacts CRASH PULSES For these far-side lateral impact simulations, the acceleration pulse was taken from a US New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) lateral test of a 2000 Ford Taurus SE 4-door. The x and y plots are displayed below in Figure 5 (the plot of large amplitude is y-axis 92</page><page sequence="4">acceleration). The vehicle was struck on the near-side, and the y-component multiplied by -1 to make it far-side for simulations. This case was almost a true 90 degree impact, only a small acceleration is seen for the x-axis. Figure 5: Crash Pulse Throughout the simulations, the vehicle interior remained unchanged. For simplicity, an acceleration pulse was applied globally to the model. Door intrusion was not replicated in this study. The geometry of the vehicle interior remained fixed. EXPERIMENTAL COUNTERMEASURES A possible countermeasure for impacts to the occupant on the far-side is the use of a reverse 3-point seatbelt. Traditional seatbelts start at the driver's outside shoulder (shoulder next to the window), latch at the inside waist, and end at the outside waist. (Some automotive safety engineers call this the outboard configuration.) A reverse belt is just the opposite- the shoulder belt starts from the inside shoulder down to the outside waist (on the window side) across the pelvis to the inside waist. (Some automotive safety engineers call this the inboard configuration.) The rationale behind this setup is to utilize the inboard shoulder belt to prevent occupant excursion toward the intruding struck-side door. Injuries occurring from far-side impacts stem from the occupant sliding out of the shoulder belt and moving to the passenger seat. The inboard belt will capture the shoulder neck region and possibly keep the occupant in his or her seat. Modeling the inboard belt involved reflecting all seatbelt anchors and the retractor mechanism about the centerline of the seat. The y-axis coordinates of the nodes for the lap and shoulder belts were also reflected about the centerline of the seat. However, by doing this, the normal for each facet reversed and needed to be reflected back towards the occupant. In addition to the inboard belt, some further countermeasures include inboard chest and shoulder airbags. Ellipsoids were used to roughly simulate these restraints. Figures 6 and 7 show the location and size of these ellipsoids. A soft function with high hysteresis was chosen to represent the airbag for simplicity. Figure 6: Transverse View of Airbag Location Figure 7: Longitudinal View of Airbag Location TEST MATRIX SUMMARY In total, five dummy models on the non-struck side were analyzed in side impat, 1. Hybrid III 2. BioSID 3. EuroSID I 4. EuroSID II 5. SID2S With these models, five vehicle configurations were simulated, 1 . Base (just vehicle interior and occupant) 2. Base with chest airbag 3. Base with shoulder airbag 4. Base with chest and shoulder airbag 5. Reverse (or inboard) Belts RESULTS The 25 simulations were completed and checked for correctness. Each simulation output an animation accompanied with time history plots of predefined measurements, such as forces and accelerations. The following discussion is limited to modeling and simulation of the 5 anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs). The results of the human finite-element model and human faceted model are unique and require separate discussion. 93</page><page sequence="5">Base For all 5 ATDs (on the non-stuck side) in the baseline configuration with 90 degree side-impact pulses, the restrained dummy moved towards the centerline of the vehicle. After translating, the hips of the dummy struck the center console while the upper body continued to move toward the far-side (struck side of the vehicle). The pelvis, restrained by the lap belt, held the dummy's hips into the seat. Meanwhile the upper torso slid out of the shoulder belt and rotated over the center console. The five ATDs grossly performed similarly, with the head of the ATDs maximum extension at the center of the passenger seat while the upper torso rebounded back to the driver seat. Some slight differences were seen in the rotation motion of the dummy as a result of various spinal constructions. A snapshot of all five dummies and a real cadaver test under similar conditions is found in Appendix 1 at 175-ms after initial impact. 175-ms is approximately the point of maximum excursion for the 5 ATDs. Seen in the animations, the highest likelihood of injuries for this case occurred in the neck and head. As the upper body rotated around the center console, the head and neck behaved as a spring-mass system, where the head is a mass on top of a spring, the neck. The head pulled and whipped the neck as motion was displayed. The head failed to make contact with any hard surfaces in the MADYMO vehicle model despite intrusion not being modeled. Figures 8 charts each dummy's assessment of neck injury. Three metrics were used - Fz, neck tension and compression; Fy, neck shear force; and Mx, the bending moment about x-axis. All these measurements were taken at the upper and lower bodies of the neck. The graphs display the peak forces and moments for each measurement. The vertical axis represents the percent value of the injury assessment reference value (IARV). Table 1 lists the Injury Assessment Reference Values (IARV) used to evaluate the forces and moments on the occupant's necks.

Injury Assessment Research Values Figure 8: Base Configuration Neck Loads Chest Baa By using the experimental chest airbag only, the occupant initially translated toward the centerline of the vehicle. Once the pelvis struck the center console, the upper torso began rotating until the chest airbag made contact with the ribs. Rib compression was seen and the shoulders rotated slightly around the chest airbag. Occupant excursion wasn't nearly as far as baseline cases, however, whipping of the head and neck was still seen. It is to be noted that the SID2s stuck the chest bag with its shoulder, instead of rib cage. This is a result of the small stature of this dummy. Neck measurement numbers while using the chest airbag are shown in Figure 9. 94</page><page sequence="6">Shoulder Bag By using only the shoulder airbag, the upper torso of each dummy was restrained from rotating around the center console. However, each dummy reacted differently as a result of inherently different shoulder construction. The SID2s struck the shoulder bag with its neck due to its short stature. Neck data for all dummies is included in Figure 10. Chest and Shoulder Baas Having results similar to just the shoulder bag, the chest and shoulder bags together restrained the dummy from rotating around the center console. The result was minimal upper torso motion and an unrestrained head whipping around. This data is in Figure 11. Reverse for Inboarch Belts The reverse 3-pt belt system restrained the dummy by the neck from rotating around the center console, preventing occupant excursion. However, the resulting neck loads were significantly increased with respect to the other restraint conditions. The BioSID data was excluded due to instabilities in the model that could not be resolved. This data is displayed in Figure 12. Figure 9: Chest Airbag Neck Loads Figure 10: Shoulder Airbag Neck Loads 95</page><page sequence="7">Figure 11: Chest and Shoulder Airbag Neck Loads Figure 12: Inboard Seatbelt Neck Loads HUMAN FINITE ELEMENT The human finite element was unable to run to completion due to mathematical instabilities that were insurmountable. In the baseline setup (standard vehicle Interior with 3-point belt), the human translated toward the centerline of the vehicle. The hips of the dummy initially made contact with the center console and the pelvic area started to deform, unlike the other dummies in MADYMO which would have upper body rotation at this point. Contrary to the dummies, this human model continued to translate until the center console intruded far into the pelvic region. It was here that the model would go instable due to the large deformations and displacements. Appendix 2 shows a snapshot of the pelvis intrusion with little upper body rotation. In the case of the human finite element model with the chest and shoulder bags, these airbags encroached into the ribs and shoulder of the human. These encroachments caused large deformations and instability of the mathematical model. As a result of these feeble results, the MADYMO human finite element model was no longer used for this study. HUMAN FACETED MODEL The human faceted model showed head kinematics similar to the head strike of the PMHS. The human facet representation would translate into the center console and continue translating while rotating until the head reached the opposite side of the vehicle. Appendix 3 96</page><page sequence="8">shows the human faceted model and PHMS synchronized at discrete time steps. One difference between the two models is noted in the behavior of the shoulder belt. In the MADYMO human facet model, the shoulder belt easily falls off the occupant. In the PMHS, some light friction keeps the belt on the occupant. In the MADYMO model, it is difficult to model friction between two faceted surfaces, which may explain this dissimilar belt performance. An advantage of the human facet model is its construction with a flexible spine. This is achieved by modeling each vertebra with individual rigid bodies. As it relates to the far-side simulations, this allows for a more biofidelic spinal bending around the center console. Figure 13 shows the spinal arrangement for this model. Figure 13: Flexible Spine and Neck of Human Facet Model The chest and shoulder airbags effectively restrained the human into the seat. The results from this model were purely visual. The numerical outputs were more difficult to interpret and compare evenly with the ATDs since measurements were taken in different locations. Therefore, the results for both human models are limited to gross kinematics. To further examine the human facet model, the authors make a direct comparison with a Hybrid III MADYMO model. A pulse from an IIHS side impact moving barrier test was used to similarly load both models simultaneously. Appendix 4 shows snap shots of the two dummy simulations at 0, 100, and 150 milliseconds. The vertical line through the passenger seat estimates the maximum intrusion distance from the impact. This estimation comes from a finite element vehicle model conducted at the GWU - National Crash Analysis Center (Digges et al., 2005). The difference between the human facet model and Hybrid III is clear when examining the occupant excursion towards the impact. The head of the human facet model traveled approximately 30-cm further than the Hybrid III. DISCUSSION For each of the ATD simulations in the base vehicle interior configuration, it was seen that occupant excursion occurred towards the passenger seat (or stuck side of the vehicle), but did not reach the far-side surface as is seen in real world accident reconstructions and cadaver tests. Some differences in dummy kinematics did exist among the five ATDs. The varying construction of these ATDs, especially with respect to the spine, allowed for different mobility when bending around the center console or shoulder bag. This is evident by the varying neck load measurements among the five dummies. For example in the case of the chest airbag, the BioSID upper body did not bend as greatly as the Hybrid III, thus it transmitted high loads into the neck as the head continued to travel. Even with these variations, overall the dummies grossly achieved the similar results. The occupant excursion for all five dummies did not differ greatly, as displayed in Appendix 1 . Also, as seen from the data in Figure 8 through Figure 12, in all baseline simulations with the five dummies, injury prediction levels were all below accepted injury thresholds. Despite the amount of motion observed in the neck, there was little to cause injury according to the model. Contrary to these results, it is known that far-side vehicle impacts cause a high number of fatal head injuries annually. Fildes, et al. 2002 showed that a post mortem human subject's (PMHS) head can strike the B- pillar in far-side impacts. In none of the simulations, did the simulated dummy make contact with any surface inside the vehicle. This was similarly confirmed by Fildes, et al. (2002) by testing a BioSID, EuroSidl, and WorldSID in comparable circumstances. None of the dummies tested struck the B-pillar. In addition, the MADYMO simulations included BioSID and EuroSIDI (in addition to the other three dummies), reached similar results. Further, to assess the dummies' suitability for far- side testing, countermeasures were introduced to prevent occupant excursion and test the reaction of the dummy. The countermeasures were chest and shoulder airbags and a 3-point seatbelt in reverse ( inboard) direction. Each restraint limited occupant excursion in different ways, and exposed other possibilities of injuries for these scenarios. A chest airbag prevented excursion to the far-side, but not as effectively as the shoulder airbag or reverse belt. In the case of the Hybrid III dummy, the head moved 69 cm in the base configuration and 59 cm with a chest airbag. However, this reduction was achieved by restraining each dummy in the rib region, which could introduce the potential for rib injuries. Rib injury numbers were difficult to pull out of the models and compare equally to one another; however, the potential of injury to this region is clearly seen in the animations. 97</page><page sequence="9">The shoulder airbag restrained each dummy at the top of the torso. In the case of the Hybrid III, the shoulder airbag reduced excursion from 69cm (base) to 34 cm, a great reduction. Unfortunately, the shoulder airbag did not support the head during the event. By restraining the upper body and leaving the head unrestrained, an additional load went into the neck. The IARV suggested the Hybrid III was close to injury value, but below the injury threshold. The chest and shoulder bags together acted similarly to the shoulder bag alone. This situation looked much like a near-side impact, where the airbags appeared similar to contact with a near-side surface (interior door). Again, the head was unrestrained and put additional stress on the neck. The SID2s was the only smaller size dummy used. The EuroSID I, EuroSID II, BioSID, and Hybrid III are all based on a 50th percentile male. The SID2s is based on a small female or possibly an adolescent. The SID2s would investigate vulnerability of the chest and shoulder bags to smaller size occupants. The SID2s struck the chest bag with its shoulder and the shoulder bag with its head/neck. Positioning of these bags for equal safety to all occupants will likely be difficult for oversized and for undersized occupants. Additionally, the chest and shoulder bags showed possible weaknesses of the countermeasures for elderly occupants with osteoporosis. The chest bag put nearly all forces into the rib areas, and the shoulder bag onto bones of the shoulder. Although injury criteria parameters for these body regions were not measured in this study, by visually examining the animations the potential is evident. Some safety researchers have suggested that the inboard 3-point belt is a simple and cost effective method for an automaker to restrain an occupant during far-side collisions. The simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of such a countermeasure to occupant excursion. All ATDs were prevented from moving over the center console, by restraining the neck. Although effective at limiting motion, this sensitive area of the body could lead to the potential for further injuries. MADYMO was able to show significantly higher neck forces for this situation, many beyond injury thresholds. In addition, injuries might be sustained in the underlying tissue in that region. For an assessment of countermeasure effectiveness, the individual results of the five dummies were averaged together for every configuration. Figure 14 shows the combined neck load of the dummies. The suggestion of neck injury in shear may be seen for the inboard belt design. For all other airbag countermeasures, the neck forces and moments fall far below injury thresholds and are difficult to differentiate from one another. Figure 14: Average of Five Dummy Neck Loads Contrary to the ATDs, the human facet MADYMO model was similar to the cadaver tests and the likely real world data. Using visual approximations, the human facet model moved similarly to a human cadaver test under the same impact configuration. In contrast the human finite element MADYMO model showed unrealistic behavior like the console encroaching into the pelvis and would not run to completion. CONCLUSION Side-impact dummies, designed primarily to test for occupant injuries on the near-side are limited in their ability to emulate occupant kinematics for a far-side impact. Also a Hybrid III test device, designed primarily for frontal impacts, is limited in its ability to test for far- side impacts. Based on historical crash data, the leading cause of injury in side-impacts to the far-side occupant is head strikes. The head strikes occur against the opposite side (the intruding struck side) hard vehicle surfaces. The occupant kinematics that led to this result were reproduced with a post mortem human subject (PMHS). The cadaver, seated in the vehicle, moved out of its seat and contacted the far-side B-pillar when its vehicle was impacted on the far-side. When three side- impact dummies - BioSID, EuroSidl, and WorldSID - were placed in similar circumstances, all failed to behave kinematically as the PMHS or simulate what is assumed to occur based on real-world crash data. Computer simulations offer an easy way to test additional dummies and impact circumstances. Five anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) were simulated in MADYMO for occupants on the non-struck side. All reacted similarly to the three physical dummies tested previously as would be expected, and failed to produce desired kinematics. Despite the short-comings of the dummies for reproducing far-side kinematics, the reactions of these dummies (in MADYMO simulations of certain countermeasures) offer some insight into future studies. An inboard 3-point seatbelt effectively restrained the occupant. However, the simulations showed significantly increased neck force levels. In the 98</page><page sequence="10">simulations, chest and shoulder airbags on the inboard side of the occupant contained the occupant and prevented excursion across the vehicle. However, these countermeasures left the head and neck unrestrained and showed awkward movement of the head. In addition, the use of a 5th% female dummy exposed some vulnerability of smaller size occupants to airbags. The human faceted MADYMO model did show promise by properly reproducing occupant kinematics. Future simulations and experimentation are necessary to determine whether such a model could appropriately predict occupant injury and kinematics for far-side impacts.
