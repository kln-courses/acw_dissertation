<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTS FOR 1965-66 ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS, 1961-1966 The five years under review coincide with the five-year Development Scheme of the Government of Cyprus. The Department of Antiquities has profited greatly from the Government's plan, for the Develop- ment Estimates are distinct from the ordinary budget. Large funds were thus available which enabled the Department to spend generously on excavations, on the extension or the construction of new Museums, on their equipment, on the preservation and restoration of ancient monuments, on the acquisition of property and sites, on publications, on the purchase of books and on various other activities. The whole work has been carried out with much enthusiasm from the existing staff of the Department of Antiquities. The former Director of the Department of Antiqui- ties, Dr Porphyrios Dikaios, who compiled the pre- vious report on 'Archaeology in Cyprus' (AR i961-62), retired in July 1963 after 34 years of distinguished service. Dr Dikaios' invaluable services to the archaeology of Cyprus were rendered successively first as Assistant Curator of the Cyprus Museum (1929-31), then as Curator (193i-6o), and after the Declaration of Independence as Director of the Department of Antiquities (I960-63). He will always be remembered as a keen investigator of the archaeology of Cyprus, particularly of prehistoric Cyprus, and as an able administrator. Following Dr Dikaios' retirement, Dr Vassos Karageorghis, the former Curator of the Cyprus Museum, was promoted to the post of Director of the Department of Antiqui- ties. At the same time Mr Kyriakos Nicolaou, the Assistant Curator, was promoted to the post of Curator of the Cyprus Museum. The post of the Curator of Ancient Monuments which had been vacant for some time was filled in 1962 by the appointment of Mr Athanasios Papageorghiou. The Department of Antiquities continued its exca- vations throughout the period under review including the troublesome year of 1964. Professor Cl. F. A. Schaeffer continued regularly, except for 1964, his excavations at Enkomi. In spite of the anomalous conditions prevailing in 1964, two foreign expeditions carried out exploratory researches in that year, one at Salamis by the University of Lyon headed by Professor Jean Pouilloux and another by the Univer- sity of Quebec in a joint Franco-Canadian Expedition headed by Professor Jean des Gagniers. Both expeditions resumed regular work in 1965. A Polish Expedition under Professor Kazimierz Michalowski carried out exploratory researches in 1965 in the area of Nea Paphos. Another expedition led by P. S. Gelling and T. Watkins from the University of Birmingham, conducted, during the summer of 1965, an extensive trial excavation on a prehistoric site near Philia. All the above missions are expected to resume work in I966. Among its other archaeological activities the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus is also engaged in publications. The publication of the Report of the Department of Antiquities, Cyprus, has been resumed after a lapse of 13 years, and the volumes for 1963, 1964 and 1965 have already appeared. CVA I and 2, by Dr Karageorghis, have been published. By the same author is the publication of Sculptures from Salamis I and II and of Picture book no. I entitled Treasures in the Cyprus Museum. Dr Karageorghis, as the Director of the Department of Antiquities, is now engaged also in the publication of the Annual Report of the Director of Antiquities. Mr Athanasios Papageorghiou is the author of Picture book no. 2, entitled Masterpieces of the Byzantine Art of Cyprus, which appeared in 1965- In the new wing of the Cyprus Museum the exhibi- tions, in Room XIX of funerary reliefs and in Room XVIII of inscriptions, were completed in the years 1961 and 1965 respectively, and are now open to the public. The first phase of a new Museum in Paphos consisting of three large exhibition rooms with base- ment was completed in the years 1962, 1963 and 1965- The collections of the Museum were transferred from the old to the new premises in 1964 and exhibited in new metal and glass cases. For technical reasons the opening to the public of the new Famagusta District Museum was delayed until 1966. Its main collection comes from Enkomi and Salamis but the rest of the District is also well represented. A new Museum has been planned for Larnaca, and work is expected to start in 1966. The present report summarises the archaeological activities in Cyprus for the years 1961-66 and the writer expresses his gratitude to all those mentioned in the report who furnished information or helped in any other way. It will also be noted that ample use was made of Dr Karageorghis annual contribution of 'Chroniques des Fouilles et Decouvertes Archeolo- giques " Chypre' in Bulletin de Correspondance Hellenique to which the reader is referred for a more detailed account. NEOLITHIC AND CHALCOLITHIC Nicosia District. From the neolithic settlement of Dhenia which was located in 1961 (AR i961-62, 32) within the prehistoric cemetery of 'Kafkalla' more material has been found. It has now been ascertained that this site belongs to the Troulli culture, i.e. The Neolithic IB period. The finds include pottery of the Red-on-White ware, stone axe-heads, mace-heads, pounders, and corn grinders. Sherds and flint implements of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic period were found in 1963 during building operations in Nicosia town itself, on the left bank of the river</page><page sequence="2">28 K. NIKOLAOU Pediaeos between the church of Ayios Prodromos and the new Ayioi Omoloyitai bridge; the site has been reported before (RDAC 1936, 77). An expedition from Birmingham University, led by P. S. Gelling and Trevor Watkins, conducted in 1965 an extensive trial excavation of a Late Neolithic to Early Chalcolithic settlement at Philia, near the Early Cypriote I cemetery of 'Vasiliko'. The site differs from that of Erimi which is considered a typical site for this period as it does not possess any circular huts and, although the pottery bears some apparent parallels, it differs considerably. Whereas the Erimi pottery is characterised by its reserved and scanty decoration, that of Philia is practically painted all over with a variety of close patterns. Another new feature attested in these excavations is the discovery of shafts, chambers and tunnels cut in the soft rock below the site. It is not clear for what purpose these structures were intended, but they might have some ritual significance. Kyrenia District. At the locality 'Vrachos tou Ayiou Savva', in the village lands of Koutsovendis, six stone axe-heads were collected in I961. A finely worked flint arrow-head was found at the locality 'Vounarin tous Loies' near the headspring south of Karavas village. From the locality 'Alonia', north of Vasilia village, come numerous neolithic sherds, stone axe-heads and pounders which were found in 1965 in the course of building operations. Famagusta District. During the years under review fragments of stone tools, vessels and flint implements were collected at the site of the temple of Aphrodite Akraia at the extreme tip of the Karpass peninsula. These were found on the south slope of a rocky hill where the foundations of neolithic circular huts are visible above ground. No clay pottery was found, an indication that this was a neolithic settlement of the prepottery stage, i.e. the Neolithic I A Period, which is contemporary with the earliest stage of Khirokitia, or still nearer at hand, with that of Apostolos Andreas, only two miles away (SCE iv, Part IA, 177). In 1962 the present author explored the area of Cape Greco, the ancient Pedalion, in the course of investigations for sculpture at the locality 'Tartsia' (KBH, 12 no. 16). Flint implements, stone axe- heads, and stone vessels were collected on top of the most prominent hill overlooking the sea to the south. This hill now called 'Tiani' agrees well with Strabo's description of the site (XIV.6.3). Limassol District. In the course of a survey carried out in 196o at the locality 'Mouzomena' in the village lands of Paramali a number of Neolithic objects were collected. The finds included flint implements and stone axe-heads, probably of the Sotira culture. During another survey carried out in 1962 in the area of Armenochori village a neolithic settlement was located at the locality 'Paktomena'. The site lies on a prominent plateau and the finds include stone axe- heads and other stone tools. Paphos District. The present writer collected in 196o a number of Chalcolithic sherds, stone axe-heads and flint implements at the 'Baths of Aphrodite' in the Akamas peninsula. The site lies between the springs and the sea. An idol in steatite was found in 1962 at the locality 'Mavri', between the villages of Kidhasi and Salamiou. EARLY CYPRIOTE Kyrenia District. A tomb was accidentally discovered in 1963 at the locality 'Katsounoti' or 'Necrotapheion' (Catling, Op.Ath. iv (1963) 152 no. 99) in the western outskirts of Larnaca tis Lapithou. The tomb con- tained a large amount of pottery of Red- and Black- Polished Ware, among which a remarkable bowl with relief and incised decoration (Fig. I). FIG. I Larnaca District. An Early Cypriote tomb was discovered for the first time within Larnaca town in 1962 in the course of conducting the excavations at 'Chrysopolitissa', where a Mycenaean settlement was located in 1959 (Karageorghis, BCH lxxxiv (1960) 504 f.). The tomb contained pottery of the Red- and Black-Polished Ware. More tombs of this period were located during the campaign of 1963, though slightly farther north by the city wall. The tombs were cut in the rock below the large blocks which formed the foundations of the circuit. Principal acquisitions by the Cyprus Museum. The principal acquisitions include: (I) A terracotta four- footed animal of Red-Polished Ware. It carries on its shoulders a saddle and is decorated on its body with zigzag incisions. Length 2I cms., height I I cm. From Pyla (Inv. no. I962/IV-I7/3). (2) From the Hubbard Collection which the heirs to the late Wing- Commander O'Brien Hubbard of Kyrenia kindly presented in 1963 to the Museum comes a series of pottery and idols of the Early Bronze Age period among which a Black-Polished bird-shaped jug and a Red-Polished plank-shaped idol both with incised decoration (Inv. no. i963/IV-20/3o and 12 respec- tively). MIDDLE CYPRIOTE Nicosia District. In 1965 a tomb was accidentally discovered south of Politiko village, in the course of reconstructing the west wing of the Monastery of Ayios Herakleidios. Politiko is well known for its prehistoric necropolis (Catling, op. cit., 153 no. 132;</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 29 159 no. I4I; 168 no. 212; Masson, O., 'Ta Kypriaka I' BCH lxxxviii (1964) 202 ff.), but this is apparently the first time that a tomb of this period has been found in this part of the village. It contained material dating from the Middle Cypriote I to the beginning of the Late Cypriote I period (published by Karageorghis in RDAC I965, I Iff.). Famagusta District. Five tombs were discovered in 1962 in the course of cutting through a small hillock for the construction of the new Nicosia-Famagusta road at the locality 'Vounos', about I kms. east of Ankastina village. The tombs belong to a hitherto unknown cemetery; one dates from the Middle and four from the Late Cypriote period. They were partly destroyed by the road works, but much material was found on the floor of the chambers. The Middle Cypriote tomb contained mainly pottery of White-Painted Ware, among which was a small composite juglet decorated with a modelled figure attached on the neck (Fig. 2). FIG. 2 Limassol District. A new Middle-Late Cypriote cemetery came to light in I964 at Ayia Phyla, a suburb north of Limassol town, when a tomb was found in the course of building operations. Pre- historic settlements are as a rule more difficult to locate than cemeteries but one was traced within the village of Episkopi during the opening of air raid trenches in I964. Although a Middle Cypriote site was known near Episkopi (Catling, op. cit., 156 no. 56), this is the first evidence for a site of this period within the village itself. Principal Acquisitions by the Cyprus Museum. From the Hubbard collection, mentioned above, comes an animal-shaped rhyton of White Painted V Ware with incised decoration (Inv. no. I963/IV-20/43). LATE CYPRIOTE Nicosia District. An unknown Late Cypriote ceme- tery has been recorded at Kato Pyrgos by the dis- covery in 1962 of a tomb at the locality 'Appiourin'. The finds include pottery of the White-Slip I and II and Base-Ring I and II Ware. Another unknown cemetery of the same period came to light in that year at the locality 'Cholades' west of Soli (this site is better known for its Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman sanc- tuaries excavated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition). The existence of a Late Cypriote settlement at 'Toumba tou Skourou', north of Morphou, was known before (Catling, op. cit., 167 no. 188), but its necropolis came to light only in 1963. Not far from Morphou a tomb was discovered in 1963 at the locality 'Mandres' in the village lands of Pendayia. This site was known before by the discovery in 1960 of more tombs whose importance is due to the presence there of a new type of pottery, the Proto-White Slip Ware (The tombs have been published by V. Karageorghis in Nouveaux Documents pour l'Etude de Bronze Ricent d Chypre, Paris 1965, I5 ff-.)- Kyrenia District. Tomb looting brought to light in 1961 an unknown Late Cypriote cemetery at the site 'Palaeokastro', on the coast west of Ayia Irini village. Another unknown cemetery came to light in 1962 at the locality 'Laoura' near the village of Karmi. A tomb was found looted but contained many sherds of White Slip I and II and Base-ring I and II Ware. Mycenaean III B sherds and fragments of bronze objects were also found. Another new cemetery of the Late Cypriote period has been recorded in the Kyrenia District. A large tomb was accidentally discovered in 1963, at the locality 'Ayios Andronikos' in Kazaphani village by the road to Kyrenia town. The tomb was excavated under the supervision of the present writer; it con- sisted of two chambers with a common dromos, the principal one facing the dromos while the other one opened to the right; this side chamber, however, proved to be the largest and the richest in finds, con- taining over 500 objects, though the other one had no less than 200. This tomb was looted in antiquity, but apparently of its gold only. The tomb furniture includes a great number of Red Lustrous bottle- shaped vases, a very great number of White-Slip I and II, many of them without decoration, Base-ring I Ware, bull-shaped rhytons and askoi. The group contains also many Mycenaean vases of common type, mainly of the piriform and false-necked type. The most unusual discovery, however, is a well-preserved ship in terracotta measuring 45 cm. in length, 23 cm. in height and 20.5 cm. max. width (Fig. 3a-b). Famagusta District. In autumn of 1962 Professor C1. F. A. Schaeffer carried out his fifteenth season of excavations at the Late Bronze Age city of Enkomi- Alasia. Many loom weights and spindle whorls in clay, as well as bronze objects and heaps of copper and iron slug found in the northern part of the city indicate that this was an artisan's quarter for the working of metal and textiles. The new sanctuary which was discovered in the southern part of the city during the previous season was further investigated. A large</page><page sequence="4">30 K. NIKOLAOU FIG. 3 a, b. rectangular court where important discoveries were made confirmed the character of the building as a sanctuary. The most interesting and certainly most unusual finds are two terracotta centaurs composed of the body of a four-footed animal with two human heads (Fig. 4). The geometric decoration on their cylindrical body is reminiscent of the Close Style (Karageorghis, 'Notes on some Centaurs from Cyprus', Xaptomqtptov e~i 'Avaorzdatov K. 'OpAdvdov Athens 1964, 161 ff., P1. XXIa). The two centaurs were found against the north wall of the court, where were also found 26 bucrania often placed antithetic- ally in pairs. The sanctuary was completely uncovered during the following compaign of 1963 when the court was found to measure I6-50 m. X Io m., and the number of bucrania found in it rose to nearly a hundred. The sanctuary proved to date from the Late Cypriote III B (Myc. III C: 2) period to the Cypro-Geometric I (Protogeometric) period. At the north-east corner of the court lies the cella and it was here that the great discovery was made: a bronze statuette representing a god on an ingot of Cypriote type. The god is wearing a helmet with bull's horns, similar to that worn by the previous bronze statuette found by Dikaios (AA 1962, I8 if.), and is brandishing a spear in his right hand while holding an oval-shaped shield in his left. Total height 35 cm. (Fig. 5). The god was found in situ in a vertical position in a hiding-place arranged with care between two floors. Dr Schaeffer did not work in 1964 but he was back in the autumn of 1965 for his seventeenth season of excavations which were conducted in three different FIG. 4 FIG. 5</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 31 areas: (a) In the area of the south city-gate where a large part inside and outside the wall has been uncovered; (b) in the area of the sanctuary of the second horned god, where the chronological sequence has been established (thirteenth-eleventh century B.C.); and (c) in the area north of this sanctuary where a large part of the city has been uncovered. Late Cypriote sherds were collected in 1963 by the present writer at the locality 'Tamathios' east of Rizokarpaso. This settlement lies near the Middle Cypriote cemetery reported in 1960 (AR 1961-62, 33). Larnaca District. In 1962 Dr Karageorghis resumed the excavations which were started in I959 (BCH FIG. 6 lxxxiv (1960) 504 ff.) at Chrysopolitissa in Larnaca town, the site of ancient Kition. A tomb of the Late Cypriote II period although looted of its gold in antiquity, contained a large amount of pottery both Mycenaean and of local manufacture. Of the settle- ment important remains of buildings were discovered as well as a great quantity of sherds of Myceneaan III C: I and of local manufacture. The most important discovery, however, made during this compaign was that of a rhyton in faience (Fig. 6) found below the floor of a thirteenth century B.c. room; it is complete but for the handle and bottom; max. height 28 cm. The rhyton is coated with blue enamel decorated on top with painted and inlaid representations of hunters and of bulls and goats. Yellow colour is used for the painted figures, red colour for the inlaid ones. These are distributed into two upper zones; a third zone below is filled with vertical running spirals. The rhyton is dated to the first half of the thirteenth century B.C. (BCH lxxxvii (1963) 368 ff., P1. VIII in colour.) The excavations were resumed in 1963 when more tombs were discovered. The funeral chamber of one of these (Tomb no. 9) measured 5 .70 m. X 3 m. with three niches cut round its sides as in some Enkomi tombs. It was particularly rich in gold jewellery: diadems decorated either with rosettes or bucrania or plain geometric patterns, mouth pieces, finger rings, earring, beads, etc. There were also Mycenaean III B vases, others in faience, a golden cylinder seal, ivory objects, among which was a miniature bath tub (Fig. 7), and a great number of bronze bowls. Remains of houses were also cleared during the season. On the floor of a Late Cypriote II building a quantity of copper slug was found, an indication that copper was worked at Kition. FIG. 7 During the 1963 season a new area of Mycenaean Kition was explored. The area lies on the northern ridge of the city between the Municipal houses and the Anglo-American cemetery, where a line of large blocks of stone were visible above ground (during a survey of Kition carried out in 1958 by Dr Catling and the present writer, the resemblance was noted between these blocks and those of the city walls of Enkomi and of Palaiokastro at Peyia). The first trial trenches proved indeed very encouraging for here was the line of the Mycenaean city-wall which was also used later on for Classical Kition. The original city-</page><page sequence="6">32 K. NIKOLAOU wall had been built with large mud-bricks resting on the verti- . cally cut edge of the rocky eminence during the middle of the second millennium B.C. The circuit had at intervals rect- angular towers built of well- dressed stones, two of which have been cleared. One of these proved to measure I8-5 m. X 5m. This city-wall was de- stroyed at the end of the thirteenth century B.c., but was soon replaced by a new one of'Cyclopean' construction. Large blocks measuring about 3m. X 1 .50 m. x I m. had been used, similar to those of Enkomi and of Palaiokastro, mentioned above. A wide street ran parallel to this wall on the outside; on its surface lay a thick layer of ashes mixed with a large number of Mycenaean III C: 2 sherds. Remains of houses were found on the inside of the circuit. On the evidence ofsherds the city-wall must have been destroyed at the beginning of the eleventh century B.c. Paphos District. An unknown site of the Late Cypriote period came to light accidentally in 1964 at the locality 'Asproyi' north of Yeroskipou village. Three tombs were then excavated under the super- vision of the present writer. The cemetery lies within a settlement of the same period, as indicated by surface finds. This site is only three miles away from Nea Paphos and therefore the nearest to it so far discovered. CYPRO-GEOMETRIC Nicosia District. A joint Franco-Canadian Expedi- tion to Cyprus started work in 1965 at Soloi. Three trial trenches were dug north of the theatre, where a large house of the Roman period decorated with painted stucco was located. The Expedition, how- ever, soon turned its attention to the eastern necropolis of Soloi. Eight tombs containing much pottery were excavated, dating from the Cypro-Geometric to the Cypro-Classical period. Famagusta District. The Geometric and Archaic royal cemetery of Salamis seems to be centred round the monuments of Ayia Aikaterini and of the nearby tumulus, about halfway between the ruins of the city and the Monastery of Apostolos Varnavas. The first tomb in this area was excavated in I957 by P. Dikaios (AA 1963, I26ff.). In 1962 V. Kara- georghis started a systematic exploration of this necropolis with most noteworthy results. The tombs fall generally in the Cypro-Archaic I period but there is sufficient evidence to show that they were also used during the Cypro-Geometric III period. For instance the pottery deposited in the dromos of tomb no. 2 (see Cypro-Archaic, below) belongs to the Cypro-Archaic I period, but many fragments of FIG. 8 pottery of Cypro-Geometric III Ware were found mixed up in the filling of the dromos. In the same filling there were also horse bones, fragments of iron nails, and horse-bits, an indication that the tomb had been used during the Cypro-Geometric III period (eighth century B.c.) with funeral rites very similar to those used during the Cypro-Archaic I period. This is also true of tomb no. 47 which lies between the tumulus and the monument of Ayia Aikaterini. This one was cleared in 1964 and is the largest royal tomb so far discovered in the area. Its dromos alone measures 30 m. in length and 13 m. in width (Fig. 8). Its general plan and burial customs are more or less similar to those of the other royal tombs of this cemetery. It is also dated to the eighth century B.c. A French archaeological expedition from the University of Lyon, under Professor Jean Pouilloux, carried out its first exploration at Salamis in 1964 with a view to locating the city of the Classical period. For this purpose they chose an eminence to the south end of the city near the harbour believed to be the Acropolis of Salamis. The first trial trenches pro- duced encouraging results, for at a certain depth many sherds of the ninth century B.c. were recovered, an indication that the city was already occupied in Geometric times. In 1965 the exploration was resumed in the same area as well as at other parts of the southern sector of the city. At 'Kampanopetra', a complex of buildings dating from Early Christian times was uncovered and many trial trenches were dug nearby. The temple of Zeus at the south end of the Agora was also partly explored. The finds from these excavations include a digraphic inscription in the Cypro-syllabic and alphabetic scripts, a kouros head in limestone and a bronze jug, all of the Archaic period, as well as a Greek inscription of the Hellenistic period referring to a general. Of great importance is the discovery of a tomb of the Cypro-Geometric I period (1050-950 B.c.), which suggests that</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 33 Salamis coexisted for a time with Enkomi. This date agrees also with the traditional foundation of the city by Teucer. The tomb which was found south of the temple of Zeus contained 250 objects, among which were vases, jewellery, seals and loom weights in ivory. CYPRO-ARCHAIC Nicosia District. In 1963 three tombs were exca- vated by V. Karageorghis at Idalion, by the Dali- Nisou road. The first one was a built tomb and dates from the Cypro-Archaic I period. The second was rock-cut and dates from the Cypro-Archaic II period with a last burial in Hellenistic times. The third tomb is Hellenistic (see below). Published in RDAC 1964, 29 ff. Famagusta District. As men- tioned above the royal cemetery of Salamis is centred round the monument of Ayia Aikaterini and the nearby tumulus. The first tomb which was excavated in 1957 by P. Dikaios has been noted before; the second and later ones are the work of V. Karageorghis. Tomb no. 2 consisted of a large dromos sloping down without steps and leading into a chamber built of well-dressed stones. The stomion was blocked with a single large stone. The faqade is well built with a cornice of moulded white limestone running along its top end. The principal features of this tomb as well as of many others dis- covered subsequently are the burial customs as revealed by the excavation of their dromoi, which were found intact. This consists of the sacri- fice of horses, sometimes yoked to chariots, in honour of the dead, a custom which seems to have been practised in other parts of the island, judging by similar discoveries at Kouklia (BCH lxxxvii (1963) 265 ff.) and possibly at Tamassos (ibid. 295). In the upper layers of the dromos of tomb no. 2 was found a human skeleton and the remains of two more were identified. The well-preserved skeleton seems to have had its hand and legs tied up; it is therefore possible that this is a servant who was sacrificed to his master. On the floor of the dromos were found the skeletons of two horses and remains of a chariot to which the animals were yoked; also bronze blinkers, iron horse- bits, and the iron parts of the chariot. A considerable amount of pottery was found in the left-hand corner of the dromos. Most of the vases were covered with a black substance, probably some liquid used for pouring libations. The pottery deposited in the dromos belongs to the Cypro-Archaic I Ware, hence this tomb was used for the last time in the seventh century B.C. As was noted above, this tomb was already in use in the eighth century B.c. Karageorghis excavated in 1964 the well-known tumulus near the Monastery of Apostolos Varnavas, which was partly investigated in 1896 by A. H. Smith for the British Museum (Excavations in Cyprus, London 1900, 1-2). In 1965 it was the turn of the Ayia Aikaterini monu- ment itself to be tackled. The excavations proved that it was a royal tomb of the Archaic period and therefore all the theories put forward in the past have been dropped (A. Westholm, 'Built Tombs in -Cyprus', Op. Arch. ii (1939) 46 ff.). The dromos, measuring 28 m. in length and 13 m. in width, had its sides revetted with well-dressed stones (Fig. 9). The skeletons of two yoked horses with their iron bits still in their mouths were found in the dromos. An analysis of its architectural elements showed that the tomb consisted originally of one small chamber built of enormous blocks of stone. In front of this chamber FIG. 9 there was a kind of propylaeum built of large blocks on the upper part of which is a cornice similar to that of the other royal tombs of the area. This propylaeum was subsequently enclosed in order to form the large rectangular vaulted chamber seen above ground and known to every visitor. The tomb in its original form dates from the seventh century B.C. Larnaca District. At 'Turabi' in Larnaca town a tomb was discovered in 1962 in the course of digging foundation trenches. 'Turabi' is best known by the excavations which J. L. Myres conducted in I894 (JHS xvii (1897) 152 ff.), but also by later casual discoveries (BCH lxxxvi (1962) 41 o). The tomb dating from the Cypro-Archaic I period contained among others many jugs with a trumpet-shaped mouth of Bichrome IV Ware, a plain torpedo-shaped jar, an iron knife and a small Egyptian amulet. Limassol District. At the site 'Limnazousa' in the northern part of Limassol town a tomb of the Cypro- Archaic II period was discovered in 1962. The furniture consisted of about 200 objects mostly pottery. In 1965 another tomb of the Cypro-Archaic II period was discovered at the same site. It contained much pottery, including Bichrome V kraters, bronze fibulae and terracotta knots and rosettes. The same tomb was reused in Hellenistic times from which comes</page><page sequence="8">34 K. NIKOLAOU much pottery and a gold diadem with anthemia in the repouss6e technique. Paphos District. A tomb of the Cypro-Archaic I and II period was excavated in 1962 south-west of the Manor House at Kouklia village. In its dromos were found a horse skeleton and remains of a sheep skeleton. The tomb was looted, but among the pottery found are a Cycladic bowl and an Ionian bowl. Among the metal objects are many iron spears and bronze fibulae. The dromos was used for later burials in Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman times. Published by Karageorghis in BCH lxxxvii (1963) 265 ff. Five tombs of the Cypro-Archaic I period were accidentally discovered in 1963 by the modern cemetery in the village of Tala. A second Archaic cemetery at Tala has been located at the locality "Spilia tou Mavrou', about 5 km. north-west of the village. A tomb was cleared here in 1963 producing pottery similar to that found within the village. From a looted tomb at the locality 'Mavrommatis' south of Kouklia village came in 1965 a large group of objects among which were a remarkable amphora of Bichrome Red II (V) Ware (Fig. zo), a bronze helmet (Fig. Ix), a bronze cauldron, a bronze bowl with embossed and incised decoration, a bronze strainer bearing an inscription in the Cypro-Syllabic script, an iron sword, iron knives and iron horse-bits; also gold sheets with embossed decoration. FIG. IO Principal Acquisitions by the Cyprus Museum. The Museum's collections were enriched by the following acquisitions: (I) A Chiot White Slip Amphora with S decoration (Fig. 12) from the area of Marion; ht. 66 cm. (Inv. no. 1961/1-2/16). (2) A fragment of the rim of a silver bowl inscribed in the Cypriot FIG. II FIG. 12 syllabic script (Inv. no. 1961/IV-24/I). (3) A lime- stone male head crowned with laurel leaves (Inv. no. I96I/IV-26/2). (4) A limestone female head; face badly weathered; hair tied with ribbon; wearing a veil (Inv. no. Ig6I/IV-26/3). (5) A terracotta rhyton in the shape of a man's head with beard and horns; identified with Acheloos. Found in the well-known</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 35 sanctuary of Meloushia (Inv. no. I96I/VIII-II/3). (6) Jug of White Painted IV Ware with a Phoenician inscription incised on the body. From Ayia Irini (Inv. no. I96I/X-I8/2). (7) A fine jar of Bichrome IV Ware. The jar stands on three looped legs and has two horizontal handles ending in an animal head. On each side an animal smelling a flower (Inv. no. 1962/V-3I/2). (8) A steatite seal engraved with a lion attacking a deer. Beginning of fifth century B.C. (Inv. no. I963/X-7/I). (9) A jug of White Painted IV Ware in the free field technique (Fig. 13). On FIG. 13 the belly two huntsmen, one holding a bow and the other leading a horse (Inv. no. I963/IV-2o/6o). (i o) A large terracotta female figurine (height 56 cm.) brought up by divers from the bottom of the sea some 300 m. off the coast of Salamis. The figure wears a long chiton and himation and three necklaces, two with beads and one with a discoid pendant. With her right hand she is holding her left breast while her left is hanging down by her side. Neo- Cypriote style; beginning of sixth century B.c. (Inv. no. I963/X-I9/I). (ii) An engraved gem in chalcedony with a representation of Hermes (Fig. 14). It has been assigned on stylistic grounds to the engraver Semon. From Marion (Inv. no. I964/I- 24/14). CYPRO-CLASSIC Nicosia District. A funeral relief in limestone was accidentally discovered in 1962 at the necropolis of Soloi, south-east of the Theatre. To the left is an old bearded man seated on a stool looking right towards a young man standing by. They hold each other's right hand in a sign of farewell; both are wearing a long chiton (Fig. 15). The plinth in which the relief was set was also found. The stele measures I 125 m. in height by o.76 m. in width and FIG. 14 dates from the fourth century B.c. It will be recalled that a similar stele was found at the same site in 1955 (AR 1955, 43, P1. IIb). The style and technique of both are much the same and it is possible that they came from the same workshop. FIG. 15</page><page sequence="10">36 K. NIKOLAOU Kyrenia District. Within Kyrenia town was found in 1963 a built bothros containing much fragmentary sculpture dating from Classical to Hellenistic times. In the same town two tombs were excavated in 1964. Their contents include a number of Egyptian amulets in green paste, a golden pendant in the shape of a jug, an iron strigil, four iron lampstands, and two bronze mirrors. Famagusta District. From the site of Aphrodite Akraia near Apostolos Andreas come many sherds of Classical to Graeco-Roman times, found in 1961. From the necropolis of Salamis comes a fragment of stone, probably from a funerary stele, bearing three letters in the syllabic script, found in 1962. This is an important addition to the rather few syllabic inscrip- tions of eastern Cyprus. Larnaca District. A tomb was excavated in I962 on the south side of Ayios Prodromos church, north of Larnaca town. It contained four sarcophagi in local gypsum, two of which were looted as was the rest of the tomb. In one of the intact sarcophagi with an angular lid were two skeletons with poor offerings. The other one with an anthropomorphic lid contained only one skeleton but with it were a fine alabastron, two silver earrings and a dozen small Egyptian amulets in blue-green paste. Paphos District. In 1965 an unknown sanctuary came to light during deep cultivation in a vineyard at the locality 'Kambos', south-east of Stroumbi village. Among several fragmentary terracotta sculp- tures collected was a beautiful head (Fig. I6). FIG. 16 Principal Acquisitions by the Cyprus and District Museum. The Cyprus Museum enriched its collec- tion during the years under review with the following objects. (I) From the Hubbard collection comes a fine series of 70o6 coins both Cypriote and foreign dating '1i' n FIG. 17 from the Classical to the Mediaeval period. One of the rare pieces is a silver stater of Evagoras I (411- 374/3 B.C.). Inv. no. I963/IV-2o/142. (2) Three pairs of bracelets in solid silver ending in serpents' heads from Marion (Inv. no. 1964/1-24/9-11). (3) A pair of gold earrings (Fig. 17), from Marion (Inv. no. I964/XII-4/9). (4) The upper part of a terracotta female figure of the well-known seated type found in the tombs of Marion (Fig. x8). (Inv. no. I964/XII-I9/5). (5) A small jug found some 50 m. east of the Stadion of Kourion at the site believed to be occupied by the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore. On the jug are three incised letters in the syllabic script reading to-te-o, i.e. xT 00e (Inv. no. I964/XII- 7/1). (6) Gold tenth of stater of Evagoras I; obv. head of Herakles, rev. forepart of a goat (Inv. no. 1966/11-11/2). HELLENISTIC Nicosia District. A tomb was accidentally dis- covered in 1962 in the school-yard of Kyra, a village better known for its Early Cypriote sites. The tomb was in continuous use from the Hellenistic I to Graeco- Roman II period and it contained no less than fifty skeletons. It was also rich in contents, including pottery, glass, bronzes, gold and silver ornaments, paste beads, silver and bronze Ptolemaic and Roman coins (Published by A. Pieridou in RDAC 1963, 32 ff-). A tomb at Soli dating from Hellenistic to Graeco- Roman times was excavated in 1965 at the locality 'Ayios Kornoutos' south-west of the Theatre. Among the finds is an interesting marble slab with a Greek epitaph in elegiac meter, dated to the third century A.D. From the same site comes another inscription which was found in 1965 in a looted tomb. This is inscribed on a funerary stele and mentions a priestess of Demeter. Third century B.C. This is the first occurrence of the cult of Demeter at Soli. Famagusta District. An inscribed stele in limestone was found accidentally in 1964 in the necropolis of Salamis in the area of the Monastery of Apostolos Varnavas. The inscription refers to KA2atvLTq Ttwuooe6vovg XaALKLttK?.</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 37 Larnaca District. The excavations at Chrysopoli- tissa in Larnaca town, which were resumed in 1965, revealed at a depth of 2 -50 m. from the surface a bath establishment of the Hellenistic period. It consisted of three rooms of semicircular shape with concrete tubs for the bathers round the walls. The rooms were heated by a hypocaust and served by a system of channels for water supply and drainage. Paphos District. The well-known sanctuary site of Apollo at the locality 'Petras Anthropos' north of Amargetti village regularly produces a number of objects turned up by the plough. In 1963 a small pedestal of white marble was discovered bearing a dedication to Opaon Melanthios. The inscription dates from late Hellenistic times (Published by I. Nicolaou in RDAC 1964, 207 ff.). Acquisitions by the Cyprus and District Museums. The Cyprus Museum acquired the following Hellenistic objects: (I) Small limestone head of 'temple boy' wearing a beret (Inv. no. 196I/VII-I7/40). (2) A small limestone head from Tamassos. Hair short but FIG. 18 tied round with a ribbon. Crowned with laurel leaves, probably Apollo. The cult of Apollo is well attested in that city. Dated to the Hellenistic I period (Inv. no. 1962/VII-2/I). (3) From Ayios Thyrsos in the Karpass peninsula comes a sandstone statue of a young boy. The front is badly damaged but otherwise it is complete. Wears a long chiton and chlamys. Feet resting on a plinth. Hair short; the features of the face well rendered. Hellenistic I. (Inv. no. 1963/XI-18/2). (4) An inscribed slab of slate-coloured marble with a dedicatory inscription to Hera was found at the locality 'Li'astrika' by the sea north of Akanthou village. This is the site identified by Hogarth with Aphrodision (Devia Cypria, London, 1889, 99) This is the first evidence for the existence in that city of a temple to Hera. Dated to the second century B.C. (Published by I.N. in RDAC 1964, 199 ff-). (5) A limestone acrolithic female head with parted hair falling back and covered with veil (Inv. no. I965/V-6/I). (6) A marble bust of Dionysos with long hair falling on his shoulders; crowned with a wreath of vine-leaves and of pine cones (Inv. no. I965/VI-I/29). (7) An inscription from Soloi on a limestone block referring to Arsinoe Philadelphus (Inv. no. I965/XI-II/I). The Kourion House Museum acquired in 1963 an inscription of the second century B.C., which was found built in the cavea of the theatre at Kourion. It is an epitaph of a three-year-old boy (Published by I.N. in RDAC 1964, 203). The Kouklia Museum enriched its already rich collections by a slate-coloured marble statue base, which was found during ploughing close to the main Limassol-Paphos road, by the village of Mandria. The base carries two inscriptions in Greek; one is a dedication to Aphrodite and dates to the Hellenistic period; the other is an honorary inscription to Rhodokles, an agonothetes, who was honoured by the Koinon Kyprion, and dates from the Graeco-Roman period (RDAC 1964, 2II ff.). The Paphos Museum acquired the following: (I) The upper part of an inscribed altar in limestone picked up in 1962 at the locality 'Agrielea' in the Oreites forest by the village of Archimandrita. It reads 'ApotvdrlO and has been dated to the third century B.C. The present writer inspected the site and noticed the remains of an important building, possibly an Arsinoeion (RDAC 1963, 46). (2) In the same year John Seltman picked up in a field at 'Malloutena', at Kato Paphos, an inscribed fragment of reddish marble from the top of a cylindrical altar. Late Hellenistic or Early Roman (RDAC 1963, 46 ff.). GRAECO-ROMAN Nficosia District. A beautiful architectural fragment in marble was found in a field, north of the theatre of Soloi. It is a block from an entablature cornice and belongs most likely to the same building from which came other similar pieces found in I942 in the same area. The theatre of Soloi which was excavated in I930 by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition has been restored to its diazoma. Reconstruction work started in I962 and was completed in I964 (Fig. g19). A tomb of the late Graeco-Roman period was found</page><page sequence="12">38 K. NIKOLAOU FIG. 19 in 1965 within the village of Politiko. It contained pottery, clay lamps andjewellery. The tomb was used as late as the fourth century A.D. as testified by four gold coins of Theodosius and Honorius. Famagusta District. V. Karageorghis continued the excavations at Salamis in the area of the Gymnasium and of the Theatre. In 1962 work was carried out in the central hall of the Baths, believed to be the caldarium. The hall is rectangular, measuring 29 m. x 14 m. and opens through vaulted exits to the east in the direction of the sea. On the north wall four large recesses of later date were revealed. The main work, however, was concentrated in the area between the Gymnasium and the Theatre. Adjoining the south side of the Gymnasium Baths was uncovered a large cistern with vaulted roof built with well-dressed stones and plastered with water-proof lime cement. This reservoir was supplying the baths with water. During this campaign it was also noticed that the Gymnasium was directly linked with the Theatre by a paved passage flanked by marble columns. In the Theatre itself half of the substructures of the cavea have been excavated. It thus became clear how this huge structure was supported. The outer semicircular wall was found to measure 3-8o m. in thickness and survived to a height of 3 m. From here other walls at regular intervals radiate to the centre towards the orchestra. An inner semicircular wall corresponds with the diazoma of the cavea. The excavations at Salamis were resumed in 1963. Work was again mainly concentrated in the area between the Gymnasium and the Theatre. Adjoining the south wall of the large reservoir, mentioned above, eight rows of seats, divided at intervals by a flight of steps, were uncovered. They are of limestone and have the same moulding as the seats of the Theatre. These seats are be- lieved to belong to a xystos. Remains of another building with curving walls also lying between the two principal monuments suggest that this may be the site of an amphi- theatre. At the theatre further work was undertaken with a view to uncovering the remain- ing part of the substructure of the cavea. It has now been established that in Early Chris- tian times, after the theatre had been destroyed by the earth- quakes of the mid-fourth cen- tury, small houses were built on the ruins of the cavea. These houses were apparently burnt down during the Arab raids of the seventh centuryA.D. Large deposits of ashes mixed with charcoal have been found on the floors of these houses. Work was also carried out at the stage where a series of rooms running parallel behind the frons scenae have been uncovered. The walls which survive to a height of 2 m. are built with well-dressed stones. The theatre has been partly reconstructed and is used for the pro- duction of Classical plays. The excavations at the Gymnasium were resumed in 1964. Work was mainly concentrated behind the west stoa of the palaestra in order to uncover the structures in this direction. At the south end of this wingwerefound the latrines ofthe Gymnasium (Fig.2o). It was a structure semicircular in shape which had a roof supported on columns; it had a seating capacity for about 44 persons. In the centre part of the west wing behind the stoa was found a semicircular exedra the floor of which lies about I m. above the level of the floor of the stoa. During these excavations a number of sculptures came to light. The reconstruction of the theatre continued and by the end of March 1966 nineteen rows of seats were completed. A fragmentary statue base in greyish marble bearing an honorific inscription was accidentally discovered in 1964 in the area of the Monastery of Apostolos Varnavas. The honorand, whose name is missing, is a high official of the Hadrianic period. The honorant is [TLtfptoS KAadvt]os 'ATTLKd'. Limassol District. The Department of Antiquities, withJ. S. Last in charge, undertook in 1963 the clearing of the Stadion of Kourion which was interrupted long ago by the death of George MacFadden, who started its excavation in 1939. The object of this new campaign was to clear the outside part of the Stadion</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 39 FIG. 20 in order to establish the width of the substructure on which the seats were built, and on the interior to determine the race-course. A great part of the south wall was thus cleared. It has now been possible to estimate that there were seven rows of seats at a total height of 4.40 m. above the internal course. The reconstruction of the theatre of Kourion which started in 1961 was completed to its diazoma in 1963, with the construction of ninteeen rows of seats. Paphos District. The site of Nea Paphos became the principal centre of exploration in western Cyprus, through the discovery in 1962 of a house with beautiful pavement mosaics. The excavations which continue yearly are being conducted by the present writer on behalf of the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus (preliminary reports have appeared in ILN June 8th 1963, 884-7 and in RDAC 1963, 56 ff.; short reports have also appeared in BCH lxxxvii (1963) 382 ff.; lxxxviii (1964) 372; lxxxix (1965) 292). The house lies about halfway between the harbour and the light- house. The excavations have revealed a large house of the atrium type dated on the evidence of the mosaics to the second half of the third century A.D. The centre of the atrium is occupied by an impluvium round which runs a portico (Fig. 21). Several architectural fragments found within the impluvium suggest a colonnaded portico. There must have been FIG. 21</page><page sequence="14">40 K. NIKOLAOU an opening on the roof above, the compluvium. Round the atrium extend many rooms all paved with mosaics. To the east are the bedrooms and bathrooms and to the west the kitchens and the workshops. The bed- rooms open round a porticoed reservoir, possibly a fish pond, as suggested by niches round the walls which must have been used as a shelter for the fish in hot weather. FIG. 22 The atrium portico and the rooms of common use had their floors paved with mosaics. The subjects depicted on them are representations taken from Greek mythology, hunting scenes or plain geometric patterns. The largest paved room, possibly the tablinum, has been badly damaged by the plough; the centre of this room is occupied by a rectangular panel in which is depicted a vintage scene. This is surrounded by a band of rinceaus and on either side of it is a wide band composed of antithetical peltae. Along the narrow east end of the room has survived a long panel with a representation of the Triumph of Dionysos. The god, seated on a chariot drawn by two panthers, occupies the centre of the composition. On either side he is attended by nymphs, satyrs, prisoners and musicians. The whole composition is flanked by a young soldier standing by his horse and identified as one of the Dioskouroi. The floor of the west portico is divided into four panels, each of which contains a mythological subject. A three-band guilloche forms the frame of all the panels as well as the partitions between them. Round this frame runs a wide band composed of octagons, hexagons and crosses. In some of the octagons is inscribed a bird, FIG. 23 a flower, a vase or a mask. The first panel to the south has a representation of Pyramos and Thisbe, the second depicts the story of Dionysos and Ikarios, the third Poseidon and Amymone and the fourth Apollo and Daphne. Several fragments of painted stucco suggest that the walls were also decorated. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that this house was destroyed by the earthquakes of the mid-fourth century A.D. Few objects were found contemporary with the house, though a great number have been found in earlier strata. Of these the most important is a small pyxis in bone with a relief representation of Harpokrates (Fig. 22). The other great discovery is a hoard of 2484 silver Ptolemaic tetradrachms found in an amphora below one of the pavement mosaics (Fig. 23). These coins date from the Ptolemy V, Epiphanes to Ptolemy XI, Alexander I, i.e. between 204-88 B.c. All of them were coined in the Cypriote mints of Salamis, Kition and Paphos (Fig. 24a-b). Other finds include a great number of bronze coins both Ptolemaic and Roman, terracotta figurines, clay lamps, much pottery and numerous other minor objects. The campaigns for 1964 and 1965 had in view the uncovering of the whole house to which the mosaics belong. Thus all its sides but the west were com- pletely cleared. Two streets ran parallel to the house on the north and one on the south; there was possibly another one on the east. On the other side of the eastern street begins another house with pavement mosaics, unfortunately badly damaged by the plough and by the construction of a house. Across the northern street is a series of small rooms, probably workshops and stores or shops. To the west begins a passage 47 30 m. long and 4"-20 m. wide, surrounded by a wall 2 io m. thick and 8o cm. high. It is paved with pebbles and has its walls lime cemented. There are only two exits, about halfway, on either side of the passage. It is believed to be a portico though the</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 41 ........._...011. FIG. 24 a, b. evidence for this is meagre. Round this 'portico' runs a narrow passage, and beyond this a series of rooms and probably gardens. This type of architecture combining an atrium house and a long portico is seen in Pompeii in the House of Loreio Tiburtino. It was mentioned above that the house was destroyed by earthquakes. This view has now been confirmed by the discovery of a human skeleton under one of the fallen walls. The skeleton was found intact but what is more important is that 12 coins were found in his pocket. When these coins are studied they will supply a terminus ante quem for the destruction of the house. A Polish Archaeological Mission under the direction of Professor Kazimierz Michalowski carried out in 1965 their first excavations also at the site of Nea Paphos, at the locality 'Malloutena', on the north side of the eminence behind the Mediaeval Castle, where the temple of Artemis is believed to lie. The Mission located a large structure with a reservoir, traces of a house with plastered walls, both dating from the Graeco-Roman period, a big channel, probably one of the main drains of the city, dated to the Hellenistic period, and most important of all several fragmentary marble sculptures among which is a statue of Asklepios (first century A.D.), and Artemis and a Satyr (second century A.D.). Another important discovery is a small hoard of thirteen silver coins found on the floor of the earliest building. They belong to the time of Alexander the Great and add new evidence for the foundation of Nea Paphos in the late fourth century B.c. At the locality 'Ammoi' along the northern edge of the city of Nea Paphos, and immediately outside the city-wall, two rockcut tombs were known for their interior decoration. In 1965 the present writer cleared part of their dromoi with quite unexpected results. In one was found a pyre with burnt offer- ings; the dromos of the other was of greater interest for it was rearranged as a second burial-place. In fact three built sarcophagi were found in it, one in front of the stomion and one on either side. Above them was built an arch in imitation of an arco- solium. There are traces of painted decoration all over. In front of each sarcophagus was planted a clay pipe, used most probably for pouring libations to the dead. Principal Acquisitions by the Cyprus and District Museums. The Cyprus Museum acquired the follow- ing: (i) A limestone slab bearing a magical inscrip- tion in Greek. Third century A.D. Published by I.N. in RDAC 1963, 43. (2) Eight finger ring stones among which a carnelian with an engraving of Athena (Inv. no. 1963/V-!7/I-8). (3) A glass flask with two human heads on the body. From a looted FIG. 25</page><page sequence="16">42 K. NIKOLAOU tomb at the locality 'Avgolemou', in the village lands of Korakou. Back to back on the body are two female heads, one with long, the other with round face (Fig. 25). Early Imperial Roman times. (Inv. no. I963/XI-22/9). (4) Two pairs of gold earrings from the same site, one with a figure of flying Eros and one with rosette (Inv. no. 1963/XI-22/Io-I i). The acquisitions for the Paphos Museum were the following: (I) A sundial in sandstone which was turned up by the plough at the locality 'Ktiston' in Kato Paphos, immediately to the west of the House of Dionysos mentioned above. The dial is divided into twelve equal sections cut in a convex side into which was cast the shadow of a bronze needle set above and still surviving (Inv. no. PM 1505). (2) An inscription cut on a statue base in limestone which was turned up by the plough north-east of the light- house at Kato Paphos. The inscription is in honour of the gymnasiarch Onesicrates. Dated to the mid- first century A.D. (RDAC 1963, 44 f.). The find place is probably that of the Gymnasium of Nea Paphos. BYZANTINE AND LATER Nicosia District. Trial excavations were carried out in 1963 after fragments of fresco painting were found during repairs to the church of Ayios Kyprianos at Meniko village. The investigation showed that the present church (nineteenth century) was built on the ruins of a mediaeval church which was painted with frescoes (published by A. Papageorghiou, in RDAC 1964, 221 ff.). In 1964 excavations were carried out at the Monastery of Ayios Herakleidios at Politiko, in the course of major res- toration works which the Department of Antiquities undertook with A. Papa- georghiou in charge. The excavations were mainly confined within and with- out the monastery church. Inside the church was found a mosaic floor of the fifth or sixth century A.D. Unfortunately many medi- aeval tombs, dug into the floor of the church, des- troyed most of the mosaics. Outside the apse was found the original dromos of a Graeco-Roman tomb be- lieved to be the burial-place of Ayios Herakleidios (briefly reported by A.P. in Apostolos Varnavas 1965, 3 =f.). Kyrenia District. During restoration works, which were carried out in 1963 at the Monastery of Apsinthiotissa, trial excavations were undertaken with a view of investigating the narthex and the refectory. It was revealed that the refectory was decorated with frescoes. Previously hidden frescoes within the church came to light; they were cleaned and consoli- dated (a preliminary report was published by A.P. in RDAC 1963, 73 ff.). The investigations continued in the following year when the refectory was completely cleared. It was then found that part of it had been transformed into Turkish baths. On the west wing of the Monastery the foundations of the cells and a series of subterranean rooms below were traced, all contemporary with the church. The restoration of the church has been completed in 1965 (Fig. 26). Famagusta District. In 1962 A. Papageorghiou investigated the remains of an Early Christian basilica which was accidentally discovered at the locality 'Petrera', north of the village of Marathovounos. The basilica is three-aisled with a narthex. Dated to the fifth-sixth century A.D. (Apostolos Varnavas 1964, 4 ff.). During restoration works which were carried out in 1963 at the Cathedral of St. Nicolas in Fama- gusta, a beautiful piece of a marble slab was found showing in relief in gothic style the facade of a Cathedral, now in Famagusta old town Museum. The remains of a three-aisled basilica of Early Christian times were excavated in 1963 at the locality 'Panayia' west of Lysi village. It was found paved with Cypriot marmara. The church cannot be dated earlier than the seventh century and was destroyed probably soon after by fire (Apostolos Varnavas 1964, 8 ff.). In 1964 the churches of Panayia, Asomatos and Ayios Georghios at 'Aphendrica', north-east of Rizokarpaso were cleared of the rubble which had accumulated in them. The cleaning of the Panayia church revealed that the Early Christian semi- circular wall of the apse joined with the north wall FIG. 26 without any projection whereas a small chamber uncovered south of the apse may be the 'Chapel of the Martyrs'. Within the apse of Asomatos church was located the synthronon while several architectural fragments from the chancel came to light. The removal of the rubble from Ayios Georghios church revealed its west wall and the narthex (for these churches, see A. H. S. Megaw, 'Three Vaulted Basilicas in Cyprus', JHS lxvi (1946) 48 ff.). A. Papageorghiou undertook the excavation of an Early Christian basilica which was located in 1957 at Ayia Trias. Work was started in 1963 and is still</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 43 FIG. 27 going on. The church, the narthex and the atrium (Fig. 27) have been uncovered. The church is three-aisled and paved with mosaics. The mosaics were consolidated in 1965. Two inscriptions on the mosaic pavement give the name of the donor and of the mosaicist. The basilica may be dated to the end of the fifth century and seems to have been destroyed during the Arab raids of the mid-seventh century A.D. Paphos District. The remains of an Early Christian basilica were partly cleared in 1963 at the locality 'Shyrvallos' on top of the cliffs east of Paphos town. It proved to be a three-aisled church paved with mosaics, unfortunately badly damaged by the con- struction of a house. In the baptistery a mosaic inscription was found and removed to the Paphos Museum (published in RDAC, 1964, 47 ff.). It refers to the donor of the mosaic who refuses to reveal his FIG. 28 name. A brief report on this excavation appears in Apostolos Varnavas, 1964, I I f. Principal Acquisitions by the Cyprus Museum.
