Blake Federal Aviation Administration Washington, DC ABSTRACT On December 1, 1984, FAA and NASA conducted a Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) at Edwards AFB. The demonstration evaluated the effectiveness of antimisting fuel additives, measured crash impact forces and the trans- mission of these forces to the occupants, and further evaluated improved fireworthy cabin materials. Although the aircraft deviated from the planned impact profile, the impact was judged to be survivable and the desired impact data was obtained. The cabin maintained a habitable space, all but one row of seats located at a rupture in the cabin remained in place, all emergency exits were operable. The seat fire blocking layers provided significant protection. The CID impact resulted in cata- strophic destruction of an engine, located at the point of fuel release, and a subsequent fire. It demonstrated there are conditions where use of antimisting fuel is not sufficient to prevent a post-crash fire. TODAY, I WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW of some of the results of our analysis of the Controlled Impact Demonstration conducted on December 1, 1984. Some of the speakers that follow will provide more detailed information in the crash impact and antimisting fuel area. The purpose of the full-scale transport Controlled Impact Demonstration was to validate technology developed to improve aircraft occupant survivability in an "impact survivable" accident through reduced post-crash fire hazard and improved structural crash protection. Other objectives of the Controlled Impact Demonstration were to demonstrate improved, crashworthy designed seats and restraint systems, to acquire crash data on a transport aircraft under controlled conditions, and to use these data to verify and improve computer models we have developed to predict transport aircraft structural crash behavior. The aircraft used in this demonstration was a Boeing 720, four engine, intermediate range, jet transport that entered airline service in the mid-1960łs. Although the Boeing 720 is now considered obsolete, its design and construction are representative of transport aircraft currently used by domestic and foreign airlines. In addition to the antimisting fuel and experimental seats and restraint systems, the aircraft was equipped with seats having fire blocking layers to retard combustion and flame spread. Also, selected windows in the aircraft were replaced with experimental windows made from high temperature epoxy which has demon- strated greater resistance to flame burn through than standard acrylic windows. The Controlled Impact Demonstration program was a joint Federal Aviation Administration/ National Aeronautics and Space Administration undertaking. The Federal Aviation Administration (the overall program manager) was responsible for the antimisting fuel effort, the cabin fire safety work, and some of the structural crash- worthiness experiments. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration developed the data acquisition system and remotely piloted control system (RPV) for the aircraft, and a National Aeronautics and Space Administration pilot, using the RPV system, flew the aircraft into the impact site. In addition to managing the flight program, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had experimental seats aboard the aircraft and currently is analyzing the effects of the impact forces on the structure. The Controlled Impact Demonstration was the culmination of an extensive research and develop- ment program involving the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, industry, the Department of Defense, and the British and the French Governments. The accident scenario was designed to be representative of an "impact survivable" accident. By this we mean an aircraft accident 6.680 0096-736X/86/9406-0680$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">851884 in which the fuselage maintains habitable space and some passengers and crew would be able to survive the crash impact forces. This type of accident is typical of those that might be expected to occur during an approach, landing, missed approach, or aborted takeoff. The impact survivable scenario selected for the Controlled Impact Demonstration program was chosen after detailed studies of past accidents and related research at the Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center. The scenario called for the aircraft to be on a 3.3 to 4.0 degree glide path in a 1 degree nose up attitude on final approach. The aircraft was to have a nominal sink rate of 17 feet per second with essentially no roll or yaw and was to impact with a longitudinal velocity of 145 to 155 knots. Following impact, the aircraft was to slide out over a packed stone bed that was built to provide a friction ignition source for the fuel. The prepared impact site also had eight heavy steel structures bolted to concrete foundations that were designed to open the wing fuel tanks to ensure fuel spills of 20 to 100 gallons per second. Operating approach lights were also installed in the slideout area to serve as ignition sources. The aircraft was fitted with two jet fueled flame generators in the tail cone to provide an additional and positive ignition source. Inside the aircraft there were 73 dummies, of which 13 were instrumented anthropomorphic dummies which have similar characteristics to human bodies in regard to response to impact forces. These 13, including the pilot dummy, were fitted with accelerometers installed in the head, thorax, and pelvis to measure impact forces. Load cells were installed to measure the forces on the lap belts and shoulder harnesses. The seats occupied by these instru- mented dummies were also equipped with multiple sensors to measure impact and slideout forces. Other force sensors were installed at 175 locations in the wings, fuselage, floor, galley, and overhead stowage compartment. Data from these sensors were recorded onboard and telemetered to ground recorders. The Controlled Impact Demonstration air- craft also carried 11 high-speed motion picture and video cameras inside the cabin, one high- speed motion picture camera mounted atop the vertical stabilizer, and one motion picture and two video cameras mounted in the nose. The nose video cameras were designed primarily to aid the pilot in the remote operation of the aircraft. Additional photographic coverage was provided by approximately 100 fixed and remotely controlled cameras positioned around the impact site. Two helicopters and a Navy photo plane equipped with special long-range, high-speed cameras provided aerial photographic coverage. The B-720 aircraft was fueled with 11,325 gallons of inline blended antimisting kerosene. Tests showed the fuel was of high quality and had the desired flammability resistance. The engines were started and operated normally on antimisting kerosene throughout the 40 minutes of preflight checks. At 9:13 a.m. on December 1, the Controlled Impact Demonstration aircraft took off from Edwards AFB, California, for its remotely piloted final flight. Weather conditions were ideal. Visibility was excellent, and the wind speed was less than 5 knots. The aircraft climbed to 2,300 feet above ground level and circled the dry lake bed to intercept a simulated instrument landing system to begin its descent. Approach speed was 150 knots, and the sink rate was within the targeted range. Below the 150-foot (abort) decision altitude, the aircraft was slightly below the glideslope and to the right. The pilot took appropriate corrective actions. At 9:22:11 a.m., the aircraft's left out- board engine impacted the ground. The aircraft was in a slight nose down attitude with wheels retracted and wing flaps deployed at 40 degrees. Contact was approximately somewhat short of the target, with the aircraft in a slight yaw to the left. The left inboard engine then contacted the ground followed by the initial fuselage impact. During slideout, the aircraft continued to yaw to the left and came into contact with the first of the steel wing opening structures at a yaw angle of 38 degrees. Initial contact was with the next to the outermost of the four wing openers on the right side. The cutter entered and passed through the right inboard engine. It then hit the leading edge of the wing and diagonally slashed open the lower wing skin back to the vicinity of the mid- chord, leading to the failure and separation of the right wing. Following contact of the cutter with the engine, there appeared to be immediate ignition of engine fluids, including degraded antimisting kerosene, engine oil, and hydraulic fluid. The fire that resulted continued through- out the aircraft slideout with the engine acting as the main flame holder or attachment point. The intensity of the fire appears to have been caused at least in part by the continued flow of fuel under pressure, possibly from ruptured fuel lines, directly onto the hot engine surfaces. This intense fire occurred in the immediate area where the wing tanks had been opened and resulted in vaporization and ignition of the fuel vapors before much antimisting action had occurred. This was in part due to the fact that the air- plane was yawed to the left such that the engine blocked air flow into the area of greatest fuel release. This in turn inhibited the desired antimisting action of the antimisting kerosene fuel and increased the exposure time of the fuel to the intense ignition source. The resulting flame passed over the right side of the fuselage as the aircraft continued to yaw to the left. The fuselage appeared to be engulfed in flame for approximately 9 seconds, and photographic evidence revealed only relatively minor damage to the exterior of the fuselage due to the short exposure time and the reduced heat transfer to 6.681</page><page sequence="3">the cabin skin which is characteristic of anti- misting kerosene. The instrumentation stripes painted on the fuselage remained visible and distinct. A second cutter struck the right inboard wing leading edge flap and slashed diagonally through the lower wing skin to the right main gear wheel well. Part of the cutter broke off and ended up in the lower aft cargo compartment. Another cutter struck the leading edge of the right wing and slashed diagonally to the reař. It passed through the lower center wing box section and penetrated the left main gear wheel well on the airplane centerline. It tore out the keel beam, permitting the burning fuel to enter the fuselage from the bottom. Fuel may also have entered the aircraft through the forward right cargo door which had opened on impact . The cutter on the far right passed through the trailing edge of the inboard right wing flap segment and then sliced diagonally through the lower aft fuselage, thereby providing an additional opening through which fuel could enter the fuselage. At 9:22:21 a.m., the Controlled Impact Demonstration aircraft came to rest. Within 2 minutes the Edwards AFB fire department was on the scene. However, it took over an hour for the fire to be finally extinguished. In part, this was due to the fact that standard crash- fire-rescue procedures designed to optimize passenger evacuation and protection were used. We believe that in this case the fire could have been brought under control more rapidly if the lower fuselage fire had been attacked earlier, which is not a standard procedure. I would like now to review both the objectives and the actual accomplishments of the three major program elements of the Controlled Impact Demonstration: 1. Antimisting fuel performance and behavior 2. Crashworthiness/crash behavior 3. Cabin fire safety/egress potential With regard to the first, our objective in the Controlled Impact Demonstration program was to demonstrate that use of an antimisting additive in the fuel would inhibit the formation of a fine fuel mist through which flame could propagate back to the ruptured fuel tanks and generate a large fireball that could engulf the aircraft and subsequently ignite spilled fuel on the ground. Prior to the Controlled Impact Demonstration, we had demonstrated this anti- misting potential in over 300 wing spillage tests at the Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center and in six catapult crash tests of obsolete military aircraft at the Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Center. We also wanted to demonstrate through the Controlled Impact Demon- stration that antimisting kerosene is compatible with propulsion systems and, after the anti- misting additive is degraded, will burn satisfactorily in a jet engine combustor during flight . Despite the formation of the fuel fed fire, there is photographic evidence from the test that some antimisting kerosene from the ruptured fuel tank escaped the fire in the desired form of large droplets. When this antimisting kerosene came in contact with the flame generators in the tail cone, it ignited, forming small fireballs which quickly self-extinguished as they moved away from the tail cone, following the scenario that had been demonstrated previously in the wing spillage and the catapult crash tests. The engines and degraders operated normally and uneventfully on the antimisting fuel prior to and during the Controlled Impact Demonstration flight. On the day following the impact, fuel samples were taken from the fuel tanks that had remained intact. These fuel samples were analyzed and all were normal. All indications so far are that the degraded antimisting kerosene is fully compatible with the propulsion system, corroborating earlier ground and flight test data. To summarize the antimisting kerosene demonstration, the impact scenario which occurred at Edwards AFB demonstrated that there are conditions where adding an antimisting charac- teristic to jet fuel is not sufficient to prevent a post-crash fire. One example of such conditions, as illustrated by the Controlled Impact Demonstration, is the case where there is the destruction of an engine and the rupture of fuel lines on the engine pylon which produce an intense ignition source near the leading edge of the wing at the point of fuel release. While the antimisting characteristic of the fuel would have prevented forward propagation of the fire had the fire source been farther aft in the Controlled Impact Demonstration, it provided limited - although still significant - protection in the Edwards scenario. Exterior and internal film documentation indicates that the resultant fireball diminished after a period of 9 seconds. Examination of the film footage and the fuselage indicates that the fuselage sustained relatively little damage during the duration of the fire- ball. The reduced intensity of the fireball is attributed to the antimisting characteristics of the fuel. A follow-on evaluation of previous accidents is being conducted to determine the probability of this type accident scenario occurring. For our crashworthiness program, the Controlled Impact Demonstration was a unique opportunity to obtain a vast amount of transport aircraft crash data under controlled impact conditions. After thorough analysis, these data will be used in the interpretation and refine- ment of crash data we have obtained from aircraft drop tests and catapult tests. The Controlled Impact Demonstration data, we expect, will also prove extremely valuable in helping the Federal Aviation Administration and the 6.682</page><page sequence="4">851884 National Aeronautics and Space Administration validate and refine their computer modelling programs being developed to predict impact forces and crash behavior. Moreover, it is expected to provide vital data needed to support crash dynamics structural research on new and advanced composite materials and for the design of improved, safer galleys and overhead storage compartments. The Controlled Impact Demonstration air- craft carried five new flight data recorders capable of accepting data on 50 different parameters. These recorders were recovered from the aircraft intact and the recorded data are now being evaluated. Moreover, the instru- mentation performed flawlessly during the impact and slideout and continued to transmit data even after the aircraft came to rest. The cameras inside the cabin survived the impact and post- crash fire and have provided important data on the performance and interaction of the seats, dummies, and restraint systems during and immediately following impact. Through analysis, engineers predicted the structural response of the Controlled Impact Demonstration aircraft fuselage under the selected controlled impact conditions. The structure remained essentially intact, with only one rupture just aft of the wing box. The fuselage maintained habitable space for the occupants in the Controlled Impact Demon- stration. Moreover, the data and post-crash inspection of the seats and restraint systems indicate that in essentially all areas of the fuselage the impact forces were within human tolerance limits. High-speed pictures of the cabin interior during impact show that all the seats remained in place and intact except for one row of three seats located near the break in the fuselage which was dislodged and came to rest in the center aisle. The restraint systems appeared to function satisfactorily; no seat belts came open or were torn loose. The National Aeronautics and Space Adminis- tration had positioned two of its anthropomorphic dummies in the braced position, and these dummies did not appear to have been moved significantly by the impact forces. Other dummies, seated upright, did move during impact and slideout. The row of seats provided by the French Government, which was installed in the aft end of the aircraft on the left, remained in place but was subsequently consumed by fire. As part of the Controlled Impact Demon- stration crashworthiness evaluation experiments, the overhead storage compartments were instrumented. While the overhead compartments opened during the impact, the galleys and their contents remained in place. Although we did not expect a major fire to occur, we decided to take advantage of the opportunity to test some of the technology that has evolved from our cabin fire safety research in case there was such a fire. We installed fire blocking layers over the cushions in alternate rows of seats. In those areas of the cabin interior not entirely consumed by flame, those seats with the fire blocking layers show much greater resistance to heat and burning than the unblocked seats. Moreover, structural fire damage in the areas above and adjacent to blocked seats was less severe than in the areas of the unblocked seats. Based on an analysis of recorded impact data, we have concluded that the Controlled Impact Demonstration flight did end in an impact survivable accident. Despite the departure from the planned scenario, the fuselage remained essentially intact. Despite extensive fuselage damage, including severing of the keel beam and the rupture of the fuselage aft of the wing box, distortion appeared minimal, and the fuselage retained its contours, providing the occupants with habitable post-impact space. Moreover, following the impact, highly experienced accident investigators found that all the emergency exits were still operable, that is, opened easily. Flight deck escape windows were operable and escape straps were available for pilot and copilot locations. The forward left main exit and the right rear exit appeared to be sufficiently clear of flames that they could have been used for passenger egress. Analysis of pictures from high-speed cameras in the cabin show a rapid buildup of smoke after the aircraft came to a stop with obscurations occurring at varying times up to 20 seconds after slideout depending on the area of the cabin. The smoke appeared to come from the fuel fire beneath the cabin floor, entering the cabin through holes in the floor and through ventilation grills. Although we can never be sure, we believe that some number of "passengers" could have escaped, depending on their location relative to the usable exits. The investigation of the crash gave the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration a unique opportunity to verify the methods they use to investigate accidents, since in this case the cause of the accident was known. 6.683</page></plain_text>
