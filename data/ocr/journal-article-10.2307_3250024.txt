Brill, Leiden/New York/Kdln, 1997, Studies in Asian Art and Ar- chaeology (continuation of Studies in Asian Culture), vol. XX, x, 355PP., 76pp. of illustrations and a map. The author's opening phrase declares that it is "a lengthy book for just one theme and one question" (p. 3). The theme is the so-called "multiplicity convention," a term she uses to refer to the multiple heads, arms and eyes which charac- terize much of Indian religious art. The question is, what is the meaning and significance of this convention. The book focuses on the origin of the phenomenon and to this end the author scrutinizes the Sanskrit literary tradition, from the Vedic corpus through the Epics as well as the archaeologi- cal evidence to the Gupta period. Her main concern is the Brahmanic/Hindu tradition. However, whenever these early sources are thought to be inadequate, later visual and textual material is taken into consideration as "further evi- dence" (p. 3). In view of the comprehensive scope of the book its "lengthiness" is within reasonable limits, though there is a certain redundancy. The book is divided into two sections: Part I, Meaning, Textual Studies; Part II, Form, Icono- graphic Studies. Such a scheme makes it almost unavoidable that much that is discussed in Part I is repeated in Part II. Images are adduced and their iconography discussed in Part I, as well, particularly in the Chapters Ten and Eleven deal- ing with the Mahdndaradyana Upanisad and the "Epics and Beyond." Moreover, some of the main theses of the book, for instance the author's favorite theme of Siva's alleged five- headedness and the symbolism of numbers, are discussed again and again, and Chapters Six and Twelve partly over- lap. The third section of the book consists of the plates, which are superbly reproduced. Though most of the images have been published earlier, many of the photographs are of a quality that I have not seen in print before. If only for the plates the book is an important contribution to Indian art history. The numbering of the photographs is linked to the chapters in which the image is discussed. When images are discussed or referred to in more than one chapter this method of numbering can be confusing. A descriptive list of plates would have done much to alleviate this confusion and its omission is all the more to be regretted. The book is evidently the result of the author's lifelong occupation with Indian (Hindu) art and religious thought. A variety of subjects dealt with in separate articles are here synthesized into one great vision, with the result that the book is rather apodeictic in character. Other scholars are cited in footnotes, but mostly in order to support the au- thor's views, not because the pros and cons of alternative in- terpretations are balanced. By "working with the entire Brahmanic textual tradition" (p. 125) and, we might add, iconographic tradition, Srinivasan displays a richness in lit- eracy and art-historical scrutiny that cannot be done full jus- tice in a short review. We shall limit our observations to a few central issues. Chapter One (Theory) introduces the subject of the book and formulates briefly the main issues to be elaborated in the following chapters. The author argues that the multiplicity convention is "not only well recognized [in the Rgveda, here- after cited as RV], but that it is employed in a fundamen- tally consistent way throughout the text" (p. 5). Chapters Three and Four show that the same idea permeates the Atharva and Yajur Vedas as well. In Chapter Two the author gives three ways (definitions) in which "multiplicity describes the structure of a deity who creates, fashions, or projects forms." An active way (I): "mul- tiple bodily parts and forms are associated with a deity who creates the phenomenal world"; a passive way (2): "multiple bodily parts and forms are associated with a deity who re- presents the raw material out of which the phenomenal world is created"; and a third way (3) combining (I) and (2): "mul- tiple bodily parts and forms are associated with a deity who creates, projects, emanates forms from its numen into the phenomenal world" (pp. 24-26). As examples of (I) Srini- vasan mentions Tvastr and Viivakarman, of (2) the Purusa of the famous Purusa Hymn (RV IO.9O0), and of (3) Indra, who in RV 3.53.8 is said to be "in the habit of becoming every rupa, in effecting mayas around his own body," and in RV 6.47.I8c to bepururupa (p. 26). The central thesis of the book is that the same multiplicity convention informs the deities Rudra and, to a lesser extent, Visnu in Vedic literature and, subsequently, is carried on in the early images in stone. Tracing his basic characteristics back to the Vedic religion, Srinivasan dismisses a non-Aryan origin of Rudra, and she finds no indication either that this deity originated from a layer represented by the materials of the Indus civilization (p. 47). The multiplicity convention as such thus appears to be an heuristic concept that, by encompassing textual and material images alike, is used to show that Rudra and his cult - the figure of Visnu is more complicated in this re- spect - belong to mainstream Indo-Aryan culture. This con- 339</page><page sequence="2">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVIII 3/4 (1999), BOOK REVIEWS clusion is not revolutionary, but the way by which it is reached is original and as such stands to the credit of the au- thor. One wonders, however, whether Srinivasan does not overstretch her point when she argues that the origins of linga worship in India are likewise to be traced back to this tradition, because "it is demonstrable that linga in Vedic and epic literature has meanings devoid ofpriapic content, and, that these meanings connect with Siva" (pp. 192, 23Iff.). This may be true, but it does not explain the worship of re- alistic phalli as depicted in plates 17.2 or 17.6. Chapters Five to Seven concentrate mainly on Rudra's nature and function in Vedic literature. Central to Srini- vasan's argument is Rudra's role in the sacrifice. This em- phasis is in accord with the author's proposal to "look at the Vedic ritual as a three-dimensional, living icon whose prop- erties could provide models upon which to construct devo- tional icons" (p. 192). As a deity to whom the sacrificial re- mainder (ucchista) is sometimes assigned, Rudra is not "di- vorced from the sanctimony of the Vedic rites; instead it at- tests to his ability to guarantee their continuation" (p. 56). Symbolically this ability is expressed, the author argues, by the number eight: "As a prime number, 'seven' relates to the sacrifice; thus a 'seven plus one' formula could symbol- ize a deity who is the perfection and completion of the sacrifice" (p. 77). Leaving aside whether "guarantee" of sacrificial continuance amounts to its "perfection and com- pletion" and leaving the numerology for what it is, it should be observed that there is another concordance between Rudra's link with the number eight and his relation to the sacrifice, i.e. Prajapati. The same Rudra, who, as the inces- tuous son of Prajapati, receives eight names, etc. at his birth (the famous astamfrti), is the one who is homologized with the first issue of the sacrifice, the dangerous "foreportion" (prdSitra, Sdatapathabrdhmana 1.7.4.9), which is procured by his (avenging) act of piercing Prajapati. This homology seems to be the rationale underlying adhydya 6 of the Kausl- taki Brdhmana. It is questionable, however, whether the astamurti is an iconographic category in its own right. Apart from two late Astamukha Lifigas, the author can only produce two dubi- ous iconic examples, both dating from more than one mil- lennium after the Brahmana period, that is postdating the period "wherein the multiplicity convention became fully established" (200 B.C.-A.D. 300); consequently, these im- ages can hardly be conceived of as "further evidence" (p. 3). Srinivasan's ingenious interpretation of the famous Parel sculpture as a Siva Astamarti requires that we count both topmost arms of the eight-armed crowning figure twice, in order to turn an apparently sevenfold manifestation into an eightfold one. This is how it is done: "But six of the bodies have two arms; the topmost body has ten arms. Here is the crux. The topmost body is to be understood as having two plus eight arms because, ideationally, it constitutes two forms; one body in the group of seven, plus the eighth en- veloping body" (p. 154). Equally unconvincing is her inter- pretation of the second example, an image found in Man- dhal (pl. I9.23-24), believed to be a Siva Astamurti just be- cause he has altogether eight heads, though he is without any other sign (cihna) that could link him to Rudra's eight forms or names (p. 279f.). In this context it should be noted that the author keeps silent about another, similar image found in Mandhal, which has an extra tier of four heads; the concept of this image is, no doubt, grafted onto the eight- headed image., The Agnicayana sacrifice provides Srinivasan with an- other Vedic starting-point ofRudra's multiplicity."In each of the five layers comprising the great altar are [sic] a group of bricks called 'mukha' bricks. There are five 'mukha' bricks in each of the five layers of the altar" (p. 193). The as- sociation of Rudra with the deity embodied in the fire altar follows, according to the author, from the fact that the Satarudriya litany is chanted after the completion of the altar (p. 193f.). Though the author admits that "it is a big jump from bricks in an altar to heads on the shaft ofa lifiga," she argues that the Agnicayana reveals "many elements sug- gestive of the iconographic properties found in the Pafica- mukha Liniga of Siva" (p. 194). The author finds support for her jump in the Svetdsvatara and Mahdndardyana Upanisads. Chapter Nine is devoted to the ?vetdivatara Upanisad (hereafter cited as ?U). 9U 1.7-9 defines the Supreme (parama- brahman) as "triune," that is, as consisting in three unborn (aja), i.e. irreducible constituents: God, the soul and nature. That there is such a unique, underlying substance is not ob- vious, but can be found by meditation; the existence of the latent form (linga), being the invisible source (yoni) of the manifest form (mirti), is illustrated in 9U 1.13-14 by the metaphor of the fire-drill. Like fire this brahman, identified it seems with God, can be churned in the heart. There is some ambiguity in the text with respect to God, who seems to be on the one hand a constitutive principle (God as per- son) and on the other the underlying substance of the triad itself. This ambiguity is ingeniously converted by Srini- vasan (pp. 98f.) into a concept of God (Siva) that implies a "triune deity" who "unfolds" himself in a "downward pro- 340</page><page sequence="3">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVIII 3/4 (1999), BOOK REVIEWS gression" in "lower embodiments": the linga and the murti.z This conception of Siva is certainly fundamental to the au- thor's vision, sustained throughout the book, but as she duly observes, it is "not explicit in the text" and whether it is implicit" remains open to question (p. lO6). The author may actually have derived her interpreta- tion, not from the Upanisad, but from an idea imputed to the Agamas: "the Agamas acknowledge the triple reality of Siva and build an entire theology around this belief" (p. IIo). This may be so; however, the author does not help the reader to check the reference and one wonders whether she has checked it herself. The phrase "the Agamas" appears throughout the book whenever the author needs to sub- stantiate a view, but nowhere do we learn more about this elusive category of texts. Where, in which Agama, written in which part of India, at which period and belonging to which school? Srinivasan refers only twice to specific Agamas (pp. 152, 177), the Kirandgama (no place specified, no edition in the bibliography, but only a reference to an ear- lier publication of the author) and the Ajitdgama, which seems actually to have been consulted once (p. 277, n. 82). The "implicit" notion of a "lifiga body" of Rudra (posi- tioned between "the Womb" that is Para Brahman and the material form) is, according to the author, expanded and clarified in the Mahdndardyana Upanisad (p. II8f.). The Andhra recension, or textus ornatior, of this Upanisad (edited and translated by Jean Varenne, I96o) contains seven verses (vss.270-76), in which aspects of Siva, together with the subtle essence or mark (lifga) of these aspects, are eulogized, recapitulated in the concluding phrase: sarva-lingdya namah. Now it is clear that this use of the word linga has little to do with the phallic emblem as such, but Srinivasan provides a connection with the linga icon by observing that, "This set of lifga verses is followed by a set of prayers which again have some internal cohesiveness. Mantras 277-285 invoke a pentad of names which come to be the names of the five faces of a Paficamukha Liftga. The names cited are: Sadyojata, Vamadeva [...]" etc., encapsulated in the name Sadasiva. The next verses invoke Siva's golden, i.e. immortal forms "golden-armed" etc. and some of his "anthropomorphic" personae, Ambikapati, etc. Srinivasan concludes that, "The sequence of these verses strongly suggests a progression dealing with the measured unfolding of the Supreme god, Rudra" (p. II9). The original and ingenious conclusion runs: "The Mahanarayana Upanisad brings together in some co- hesive fashion the threefold typology which is the diagnos- tic classification of Saiva art in the Indian subcontinent" (p. 121). The Upanisad is dated on very shaky grounds (namely on the Samdhya portion of it) to "circa first century A.D.," a date that "would help to explain a certain dialogue, felt to exist, between ideas presented in the text and their responses in early Hindu art" (p. 121). This is, if not a petitio principii, certainly begging the question. Supposing Srinivasan's ana- lysis to be correct, the question is whether the concept be- lieved to underly the Andhra recension of the Upanisad is concomitant with the origin of Saiva art and as such mould- ing and explaining it, or rather an idea imposed on the text with the intention to "diagnose" early Saiva art in confor- mity with later Siddhanta interpretative theology. By all odds the latter seems more likely to be the case, on account of the textual situation, which is, inexcusably, completely ignored by Srinivasan. The Upanisad has been transmitted in two other recen- sions, one ascribed to the Atharva tradition, the other one claiming to be the tenth adhydya of the Taittirtya Ara?2yaka and as such commented on by Sayana, the so-called Dravida recension. First it should be observed that the sequence of verses which suggested to the author "a progression dealing with the measured unfolding" is completely different in the other recensions and, secondly, the section dealing with the so-called "linga-body" (vss. 270-76) is altogether missing in the two other recensions, indicative of its being a later ad- dition. As a consequence the author's interpretation of the five formulae figuring a pentad of epithets in the Mahdnd- rdjayana (in later theology indeed assigned to the faces [mukha] of Siva's li ga) to the effect that "by the time of this text, there developed the belief in an unfolding subsequent to [or within?] the linga stage, which was recognized as being five- fold in nature" (p. 120), seems to be untenable, or at least an anachronism. What, we may ask, is the archaeological evidence per- taining to the early period that illustrates the fivefold nature of Siva's unfolding? Srinivasan adduces only one example, "the Sufiga Paficamukha Lifiga from Bhita" (p. 122). How- ever, as the studies ofJ.N. Banerjea and Gerd Kreisel have shown (ignored by the author in her multi-staged discussion of this image: pp. I85f., 195, 222, 234f.),3 we are here con- cerned with an anthropomorphic, ithyphallic figure, and not with a linga. The author is right, however, when she ob- serves that the circle of four heads conforms to the other ev- idence thought to represent Siva's "fivefold nature," the early catur-mukha-lirigas, a comparison also made by Kreisel. 341</page><page sequence="4">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVIII 3/4 (1999), BOOK REVIEWS Srinivasan, and many authors before her, are at pains to ex- plain the absence of the theological belief in a "threefold Saiva Reality" and the "five-headed Saiva god" in a text that is indeed more or less contemporaneous with the early ar- chaeological material, the Mahdbhdrata (pp. I48ff.). The for- mer concept, she declares, is "sustained, almost by default," whereas with regard to the five-headed Siva she admits that "the epic is opaque." The epic does maintain explicitly the notion of Siva's four-headedness and quadriform (caturmukha: MBh. 1.203.26, 13.17-74; caturmzurtitva: MBh. 13.128.4), a concept that is il- lustrated in the myth of Tilottama (MBh. 1.203.21-26, 13.128.3-8), evidence that is discarded by the author as lild and as having nothing to do with veda, i.e. "theological knowledge" (p. 13). This veda requires - but the reviewer has to admit that much of the latter part of Chapter Eleven, "The Bridge from Words to Forms," is beyond his compre- hension - that the theoretician should conceive of four as being actually five ("It is well known that a figure in the round ofa four-faced Siva [...] refer(s) to the theological po- sition inhering in the five-faced Siva," p. 13), whereas the empiricist should learn to apply the device (which is evi- dently a much later invention) of declaring the fifth head in- visible, by virtue of the fact that it is associated with ether (dkaa): "his four heads simply remind that the fifth is in- visible and that five-headedness is the hallmark of Siva" (p. 161). Could the early Saiva icons not simply represent what they look like, a four-headed god, that is a god that manifests himself in four aspects or personae? Having argued that worship of Rudra and the liniga is or- thogenetic to the Indo-Aryan tradition, Srinivasan admits that things are more complicated with regard to the origin of the Vaisnava tradition. The figures ofVisnu and Ndrayana have clearly Vedic antecedents, but the origin of the other early cult figures belonging to the broad stream of the Bha- gavata religion, Vasudeva-Krsna, the Vrsni Viras, is more problematic. Chapter Sixteen surveys the material evidence of their cult. The author argues convincingly that the cult of (human) heroes, including that of the five Vrsni heroes, is related to Yaksa worship. While most images come from Mathura and its environs, one of the earliest examples of an image in which Yaksa, Vira and Vaisnava elements fuse is the sculpture found in the Chhattisgarh region (MP), in the village of Malhar. Srinivasan argues that the Malhar sculp- ture is a vaisnava Maha Vira, possibly Vasudeva-Krsna, rep- resenting "the humane apparition of a higher god" (p. 218). The four arms of the crowned image, holding the cakra, mace, sword, and perhaps the conch, may "declare the god's sovereignty over the whole world on the horizontal and ver- tical planes" (p. 23). All this seems plausible enough, though the iconography of four arms poses a problem from the au- thor's point of view. The Malhar image is among the earli- est instances of the multiplicity convention, yet the thread that links it with the Indo-Aryan or Vedic tradition is thin. If the multiplicity convention is specific to this tradition, and if the "Vedic" Mahdndrdyana Upanisad is silent on "re- ligious developments leading towards an understanding of the early multiplicity images ofVasudeva-Krsna" precisely because this deity is "not deeply entrenched in Vedism" (p. 128), how do we explain that this convention is imple- mented in such an early specimen (Ist century B.c.) in such a remote area? Could there be yet another source, folk or tribal religion perhaps, of the idea that multiplicity of arms expresses super human, i.e. divine power? On the whole Srinivasan's treatment of the Vaisnava tra- dition is more convincing than her discussion of the Saiva material which, one has the impression, has been squeezed into the preconceived straightjacket made up by the Vedic origins of its conventions. Occasionally the same happens with the other material, for instance when the colossal Yaksa piece found in Bhita, which shows two addorsed figures with two more heads on the sides above the figures of a lion and pig, is interpreted as a vaisnava Caturvyaha image "in- vented to transmit a rather complex theological doctrine (p. 209). In conclusion it seems that the overall scheme of the book leading Saiva iconography back to Vedic origins, where it is "latent" (p. Io), fails to carry conviction. More- over, there are frequent doubts in individual cases regard- ing the interpretation of textual and iconographic details. However, despite these reservations, Srinivasan's grand vi- sion, which has incited her to survey all sources of early Hin- duism on a scale not previously undertaken, is admirable. The author, in her zeal to show the homogeneity of Indian culture, attaches perhaps too much value to only one strand of this culture, the Brahmanic tradition. All the same, I do not know of any previous attempt to synthetise so system- atically the Indian iconographic and Brahmanical textual traditions. As such the book, for all its shortcomings, is orig- inal and opens new avenues for research in the field of art as well as textual studies.
