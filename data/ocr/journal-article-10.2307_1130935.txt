Cognitive Abili- ties of Kenyan Children in Relation to Nutrition, Family Characteristics, and Education. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1989, 60, 1463-1474. The purpose of this study was to determine whether nutritional factors, family characteristics, and the duration of schooling were associated with cognitive and attentional capacities in children growing up in rural Kenya. Food intake was measured by direct observation and weighment twice monthly over the course of a year. Families were characterized in terms of socioeconomic status and the literacy of the parents. Children who were better nourished had higher composite scores on a test of verbal comprehension and the Raven's matrices. Better- nourished females were more attentive during classroom observations than malnourished female schoolchildren. Family characteristics and duration of school participation were associated with cognitive abilities for both boys and girls. For the children considered as a group, cognitive scores were best predicted by a combination of factors including duration of schooling, food intake, physi- cal stature, and SES. More than 50% of the world's children live in developing countries, but influences on the cognitive skills of these children have been investigated far less than have influ- ences on the cognitive skills of children in developed countries (Werner, 1986). Malnu- trition is a problem in many developing coun- tries, and estimates are that 48% of children in Africa are poorly nourished (Pollitt, 1988). However, there is only limited understanding of the impact of malnutrition, particularly of mild to moderate undernutrition, which is far more prevalent than severe malnutrition, on the cognitive and attentional skills of chil- dren. One of the major reasons for the relative paucity of information about the effects of nu- trition is the problem of assessment. Severe malnutrition can be identified fairly easily by the child's physical appearance, so that the serious consequences of severe malnutrition have been documented (Galler, Ramsey, Sol- imano, Lowell, &amp; Mason, 1983; Hertzig, Birch, Richardson, &amp; Tizard, 1972; MacLaren, Yatkin, Kanawati, Sabagh, &amp; Kadi, 1973; Monckeberg, 1968). On the other hand, undernutrition can only be identified by measuring nutritional status in subtle ways. Many studies have relied on anthropometric measurements of children as nutritional indi- This research is a component of a larger study entitled "Energy Intake and Human Function- ing: Nutrition Collaborative Research Support Program" carried out in Kenya, Egypt, and Mexico and supported by USAID Contract no.

However, an individual's body size is affected by a variety of factors other than food intake, such as genetic predisposi- tion and health. Some studies have measured food consumed through recall, but dietary re- call tends to be inaccurate. The food sup- plementation studies have produced evi- dence of a somewhat weak relation between food intake and cognitive development (Pol- litt, 1987) partly because the amount of food consumed beyond the supplementation is not always known. The need is for studies in which observation and weighing of food are made on a regular basis. The present study is part of a large pro- gram of research undertaken in Kenya, Egypt, and Mexico to investigate the functional ef- fects of substandard levels of food-energy in- take in the range of mild to moderate depriva- tion. The rationale for this aim emerged from a series of meetings sponsored by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in which it was agreed that the most common form of malnutrition is due to insufficient intake of food overall, expressed in aggregate as insuf- ficient intake of energy. Several target pop- ulations were selected for study: pregnant women, infants from 3 months conceptional age to 6 months postnatal age, toddlers from 18 months to 30 months, and school-age chil- dren. The research plan was designed to test six main sets of hypotheses. For the school- age children, the hypothesis was as follows: Food intake of the child between 7 and 9 years affects his or her body weight, morbid- ity, and behavioral and cognitive performance (Calloway, Murphy, &amp; Beaton, 1988). This ar- ticle reports on the relations between food in- take and cognitive performance. A second limitation of many studies of undernutrition is that other environmental characteristics have not been measured si- multaneously. Several researchers have sug- gested that the effects of nutrition can be understood only in terms of the family and school environments provided for children (Johnston, Low, deBaessa, &amp; MacVean, 1987; Ricciuti, 1988; Winick, Meyer, &amp; Harris, 1975). The kinds of economic and educational resources available to the family and child are likely to influence the learning experiences of the child both in and out of school. Socioeco- nomic and educational levels of families are strongly associated with cognitive perfor- mance of children in countries where varia- tions in nutritional intake and level of school- ing are limited. The relations between family characteristics and childhood cognitive abili- ties have not been investigated very often in developing countries, particularly in relation to nutritional adequacy and schooling. The issue of measurement of family and child characteristics is a complex one. The so- cioeconomic and educational status of the family can be assessed only with measures designed for the particular cultural milieu so that the validity of the measures is often un- known. Child cognitive abilities must be reflected in activities that are appropriate to the cultural demands on the child but still have established reliability and validity. Stud- ies of nutritional interventions, such as the project in Guatemala (Barrett, Radke-Yarrow, &amp; Klein, 1982; Klein, Irwin, Engle, &amp; Yar- brough, 1977), invested a great deal of effort in designing outcome assessments. In the project reported in this article, there was an additional constraint in that the study was car- ried out simultaneously in three different countries so that cognitive measures had to be used that tapped similar processes but were still appropriate for the children in the three countries. In addition, the aim was to assess not only the child's cognitive skills but also the child's sustained attention to classroom activities. For the 7- and 8-year-old child, the devel- opment of cognitive skills is often focused on most directly in the context of formal school- ing, and many studies have demonstrated the effects of schooling on cognitive skills (Greenfield, 1966; Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition, 1983; Rogoff, 1981). The effects of nutrition may be modified by differ- ences in school experiences. In the food- supplementation study reported by Chavez and Martinez (1981), differences between supplemented and nonsupplemented chil- dren diminished in the second year of school- ing, which the authors attributed to the poor quality of education. Thus, the association be- tween the duration of schooling and cognitive skills is important to investigate. The aim of this research report was to examine the relations between attentional and cognitive skills of children in a devel- oping country and nutritional status, family characteristics, and duration of school experi- ences. The focus of the nutritional measures was on energy intake. We hypothesized that the adequacy of the provisions available to the child in terms of food intake, educational resources of the family, and duration of school experience would be associated with the child's level of cognitive skills.</page><page sequence="3">Sigman et al. 1465 Method Description of the Study Area The area of study includes three subloca- tions of Embu District, which is 120 miles northeast of Nairobi. The study area has been described in a previous paper (Sigman et al., 1988). Almost all individuals in the area be- long to the Embu tribe and speak Kiembu. Most of the families in this area are monoga- mous and basically nuclear rather than ex- tended; only monogamous families were included in this study. This community, with limited food resources and occasional droughts and food shortages, was selected rather than a more impoverished locale be- cause of the intention to investigate the ef- fects of mild to moderate undernutrition. Study Design Households were recruited into the study based on the presence or anticipated presence of a target individual. As mentioned in the introduction, target individuals con- sisted of pregnant women and their infants, toddlers, school-age children, and the parents of all these children. Food intake and an- thropometry data were collected on these in- dividuals. Some information, including indi- cators of social and economic status and sanitation, was collected for all 247 house- holds involved in the study. Infants were fol- lowed from birth to 6 months of age and follow-up testing was administered at 30 months. Assessments and home observations of toddlers were carried out from 15 to 30 months, with a longitudinal follow-up at age 5 years. School-age children were followed over the course of a year. Sample The school-age sample consisted of 138 children, 62 females and 76 males. During the time of participation in the study, the children had a mean age of 7-7 (SD = 4-2), with a range from 7-1 to 8-5. Cognitive tests were administered to 133 children, 60 females and 73 males, on three occasions from June 1984 to May 1985. Classroom observations were carried out for 124 children, five of whom did not have cognitive assessments. Procedures Cognitive assessments.-Testing was carried out in the child's home with the child seated at a table or on the ground either in the house or outside. Testing was done by one of four women, very experienced with children, who lived in the area and were fluent in Kiembu and English. Training of testers was extensive and was carried out initially by one of the authors who observed each tester on multiple occasions. Subsequently, testing was supervised by a professional psychologist, Susan D'Souza, who observed more than half the test sessions. All testing was done in Kiembu. The cognitive measures consisted of an assessment of verbal comprehension and an assessment of performance abilities. The ver- bal comprehension measure was similar to the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1981) in that the child had to select the picture matching a verbal label from a set of four pictures. The test was designed in East Africa and used in urban settings in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. For our purposes, the verbal labels were translated into Kiembu. The first two items were used to ensure that the child had understood the instructions; all children passed these items. The elementary items required picture recognition of simple nouns, whereas the most advanced items in- volved more abstract concepts. The Raven's Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1965) was used to assess performance abilities. This test re- quired the child to select the correct pattern to complete a set of six patterns. At the level assessed in this study, the test required obser- vation of perceptual detail and some aware- ness of sequence. All the items of both the verbal meaning and Raven's matrices assess- ments were administered because linear or- dering of items according to task difficulty had never been established for this sample. The child's score was the total number correct on each test. Because there were no standardization data available on these tests for this popula- tion, the means and standard deviations were computed for six age levels, each extending over 5 months. Raw scores were transformed into z scores for each child on each test. Since the two measures were intercorrelated (r = .49), a composite mean cognitive score has been used for analyses. There was stability in this cognitive score over time. Correlations from the first and second tests to the last test were significant, r(124) = .68, p &lt; .0001, r(129) = .71, p &lt; .0001, as were correlations from the first to the second test, r(128) = .68, p &lt; .0001. Repeat reliability was similar for males and females. Construct validity was as- sessed using the mean school examination scores of children enrolled in school. The cognitive score was significantly associated with mean examination grades, r(102) = .56, p &lt; .0001. Thus, the cognitive measures ap- peared to reflect some of the skills acquired and required in local schools.</page><page sequence="4">1466 Child Development Each child in this sample was tested three times with an interval of 2 months be- tween the first two tests and 8 months be- tween the second and third tests. In this arti- cle, the mean score obtained on the three tests was used for data analysis. Observations of classroom behavior.-- The children's behavior in the classroom was observed in order to determine the extent to which the children were able to attend to classroom activities. Observations were car- ried out by a group of people different from the groups assessing cognitive skills, nutri- tional intake, anthropometric status, and fam- ily characteristics. Using a time-sampling pro- cedure (10 sec observe-20 sec record), observers coded whether the child talked to another child, played with an object, or was off task for the entire 10-sec interval. An ob- servation session included three classes, each lasting from 25 to 30 min in length. Two chil- dren were coded alternately each 30-sec pe- riod during each class so that no single child was looked at continuously. The observations were conducted at 3-month intervals. Data were included only for children who were ob- served at least twice. The majority of subjects were observed on three different occasions, and some subjects were observed four times. Interrater reliability was measured with observations of 18 children, each observed for three class periods. Correlations between ob- servers for the various measures were high. For the measure focused on in this article, the number of intervals in which the child was totally inattentive, the interrater correlation was good, r(17) = .93, p &lt; .01. The data for each class and observation session were converted to percentage scores since the length of observation varied. Per- centages were calculated for the number of intervals that the child engaged in an off-task behavior and the number of intervals in which no inattentive behavior occurred. Chil- dren were off task for 17% of the intervals on the first observation, 18% on the second ob- servation, and 14% on the third observation. They were totally attentive for 66%, 67%, and 75% of the intervals during the three observa- tion times, respectively. There was consider- able intersession reliability in the extent to which an individual child was off task from one observation to the next. The correlations between percentages of off-task periods were r(84) = .51, p &lt; .0001, from the first to the second observation and r(97) = .44, p &lt; .001, from the second to the third observation. Sta- bility was similar for males and females. Chil- dren who were off task frequently had lower cognitive scores, r(117) = -.24, p &lt; .05, and lower school examination grades, r(102) = - .23, p &lt; .05. Nutritional measures.-Food intake was assessed for each child on 2 successive days monthly by a trained observer who watched cooking, measured volume and weight of rec- ipe ingredients, and weighed food given to the child during the period from 7:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.. The mother was interviewed on the subsequent morning about food given to the child after 6:00 P.M., and the child was asked about food eaten out of the home. Both males and females were observed for just over a year (M = 1.1 years, SD = .32). Conversion of the food to nutrient com- position involved development of a nutrient data base, calculation of the nutrient values of household recipes, determination of nutrient values for standard recipes, and calculation of nutrient intake totals for individuals. Since no single food table appropriate for Kenya ex- isted, 45 Kenyan foods, including staples and main dishes, were analyzed in a commercial laboratory in the United States. Other nutri- ent information came from a variety of sources, including the FAO tables for Africa and USDA tables. Standard recipes were col- lected for recall of dishes eaten away from home. For this article, the school child's average consumption of calories, protein, carbohy- drate, fat, and animal protein over the length of their involvement in the project was exam- ined. These variables were selected because of the focus of the study on energy. Protein, carbohydrates, and fat are the main sources of energy in the diet. Animal protein is of partic- ular interest because it is so scarce. Measures of physical development.- Anthropometric measures were made monthly by pairs of trained local people who each made independent readings that they then corroborated. If the differences between readings exceeded certain limits, the children were remeasured. Height was measured with a portable device (nivotoise) consisting of a metal foot plate, a head plate, and a retract- able steel tape. The headpiece has a built-in carpenter's bubble which when leveled indi- cates that the headpiece is horizontal. After selecting a measurement site with a hard, flat ground surface next to a vertical wall, the sub- ject was asked to remove all footwear and to stand on the nivotoise foot plate with feet to- gether. The subject was instructed to stand comfortably upright, with eyes looking ahead</page><page sequence="5">Sigman et al. 1467 and arms held loosely at the sides of the body. With the bottom end of the tape attached to the foot plate, the headpiece was raised (thereby extending the tape) and placed on the top of the head. By checking the bubble level, the enumerator verified that the head- piece was horizontal. Finally, after the body position and the position of the headpiece were checked by the partner, the tape was locked and a reading was taken by the first tester to the nearest 0.1 cm and recorded on the form. The second team member then re- peated the procedure. Portable, battery- powered, digital read-out Heath scales were used to weigh the children. While the tester zeroed the scale, the child removed as much excess clothing as possible, bearing in mind the constraints of privacy and warmth. The child was then instructed to stand perfectly still with both feet together on the middle of the scale and facing the display. Upon steady- ing, the displayed weight was read by the first tester to the nearest 0.1 kg and recorded on the form. The procedure was then repeated by the second tester. The Heath scale was calibrated regularly and yielded comparable values to a beam balance. Repeat measure- ments were done on the same or next day for 30 children, with good reliability, r(28) = .96 for height, .99 for weight, p &lt; .001. While a variety of anthropometric data were collected, only the mean height for age, weight for age, and weight for height that the children at- tained over the period of observation are dis- cussed in this article. Weight for height was correlated with the mean caloric intake, r(136) = .55, p &lt; .001, supporting the validity of the food intake and anthropometric mea- sures. Family characteristics.-Family demo- graphics were characterized by the overall so- cioeconomic standing and the literacy of the parents. Socioeconomic status was measured with a scale that rated the amount of land and material objects possessed by the family, the quality of the homestead, and outside income. Interviews were conducted quarterly during the time that the family was enrolled in the study. Revisits within 1 week of the original interview were conducted for 3% of the sam- ple, and the data obtained corresponded ex- actly for 84% of the values. In order to vali- date this scale, the local subchiefs developed criteria to distinguish between households that were more or less esteemed and ranked households in their locales on this basis. The association between the subchiefs' rankings and the project socioeconomic status measure was fairly substantial, r(245) = .48, p &lt; .001. Parental literacy was assessed with mea- sures of the ability to read and comprehend passages of text from graded local test books selected to reflect different levels of difficulty. Test score was equal to the total number of passages read aloud on which two of three questions were answered correctly. Twenty- nine adults were tested simultaneously by two examiners with perfect agreement on scoring. Duration of schooling.-The child's school standard or grade was recorded by classroom observers who were present in the classroom in January 1985. Children were in nursery school or in first or second standard, although a few children were in the third standard. In this area not all children attend nursery school, but no child is placed in the second standard without having been in the first standard. The group was divided into two educational levels, nursery school and first standard (n = 69) and second and third stan- dard (n = 61). At the time of the testing, the children in the first group had been enrolled in school for a half year to 11/2 years, while the children in the second group had been enrolled in school for 11/2 to 3 years. There were no school data available for eight chil- dren. Results Physical Stature The mean height for the male schoolchil- dren in this sample was 116.24 cm (SD = 5.0) and mean weight was 20.15 kg (SD = 2.1). For the females, mean height was 115.54 cm (SD = 6.6) and mean weight was 19.88 kg (SD = 2.9). Using reference data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics (Hamill et al., 1979), about 25% of the sample were considered stunted in that their heights for age were less than 90% of the median. For the whole sample, the mean z score for height calculating scores with NCHS standards was -1.69 (SD = 1.03) with a range from -4.44 to +0.71. Only nine children had z scores above 0. The mean z score for weight for age was - 1.46 (SD = .81) with a range from - 3.76 to +.50, with only five z scores above 0. Only about 1% of the sample had weights for age that were less than 60% of the median, but 40% had weights for age that were be- tween 60% and 80% of the median. The mean z score for weight for height was -.47 (SD = .68), with a range from -2.47 to .95 and 33 z scores above 0. Thus, these children were quite small and thin by comparison with the NCHS data, with mean weights and heights around the fifth percentile.

The males and females in the sample were not different in terms of their weight for age or height for age (see Table 1). Food Intake The mean daily energy intake for the male schoolchildren was 1,524 kcal, with a range from 995 to 2,240 kcal. For the females, mean intake was 1,362 kcal, with a range from 876 to 1,902 kcal. In order to estimate energy requirements for this sample, a report by the FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) was used. Using group mean weights, predicted basal meta- bolic rates, and estimates of moderate activity level, male schoolchildren in Embu are thought to require 1,626 calories daily, while females are thought to require 1,464 calories daily. With these estimates, the overall sam- ple received 93%-94% of the FAO recom- mended intake. Sixty-five percent of the boys and 73% of the girls had daily caloric intakes below the recommended levels. The mean daily protein intake for the males was 45 grams, with a range from 28 to 69 grams, while the mean for the females was 40 grams, with a range from 25 to 57 grams. Only about 6% of this protein came from animal sources. The mean daily intake of animal protein was 2.7 grams, with a range for 0 to 10 grams. Based on the FAO/WHO/UNU estimates of the amount of egg and milk pro- tein required to sustain normative levels of protein accretion in normal children, Embu schoolchildren are thought to require a mean of .81 grams per kilogram of body weight daily. Given a mean weight of about 20 kg for the children in this sample, the daily intake of protein was about 1.99 grams per kilogram for the females and 2.23 grams per kilogram for the males. However, over 90% of the protein came from vegetable sources. Aside from the fact that caloric intake was low for 65%-70% of the children in the sample, there are other reasons for concluding that the children were not adequately nour- ished. First, estimates of dietary requirements are based on weight, and these children were very small and thin, so the estimates were necessarily very low. Second, these estimates assume moderate activity levels, but some children in Kenya appear to be very active. Finally, there was variability within the sam- ple, so a sizable proportion of children had energy intakes far below the recommended levels. As expected, the levels of the various nu- trients were intercorrelated. Overall mean en- ergy intake, carbohydrate intake, and protein intake were all very highly correlated (r's &gt; .90).

The level of intake of animal protein was highly significantly related to fat intake (r = .78), moderately related to protein and overall energy consumption (r's = .36 and .32) and uncorrelated with carbohydrate consumption. The correlations between nutrients were al- most identical for males and females. The gender differences in food intake were significant, Hotelling-Lawley F(5,132) = 3.26, p &lt; .01. The males had significantly higher calorie, protein, fat, and carbohydrate intakes than the females, but the two groups did not differ in animal protein intake (see Table 1). Given the differences in food intake, subsequent analyses were calculated sepa- rately for males and females. Relations between Cognitive Scores and Nutritional Status In order to determine if nutritional status was associated with cognitive abilities, Pear- son product-moment correlations were com- puted between the score on the cognitive as- sessments with the three anthropometric and five food intake measures. All the an- thropometric and food intake measures were positively associated with cognitive scores ex- cept for height and carbohydrate intakes for the boys (see Table 2). While the relations between food intake and cognitive score seemed stronger for the females than the males, the correlations were not significantly different, and this was also true for the corre- lations between food intake and classroom behavior reported below. In order to determine if the effects of caloric intake were similar across the whole range, the children were divided into three groups based on their caloric intake. This di- vision was done separately for males and fe- males because of the differences in their food intake. The cognitive scores of the children in the three groups differed significantly, F(2,130) = 9.37, p &lt; .002. According to post- hoc comparisons, the cognitive scores of the children whose intake was in the bottom third of the distribution differed from the cognitive scores of the children in the other two groups. The cognitive scores of the children whose caloric intake was intermediate did not differ from the scores of the children with the high- est caloric intake. Thus, some minimal level of caloric intake was necessary for adequate functional development. Relations between Cognitive Scores and Family Characteristics Pearson product-moment correlations were computed between the measures of pa- rental literacy and SES with cognitive scores. A mean reading score for both parents was computed from maternal and paternal reading scores. The socioeconomic and educational resources of the family were associated with cognitive scores for both girls and boys (see Table 2). Children with more literate parents</page><page sequence="8">1470 Child Development TABLE 3 CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SES AND FOOD INTAKE Females Males kcal .................... .22 .32* Protein ................. .23 .30* Animal protein .......... .56* .52* Fat ..................... .49* .52* Carbohydrates .......... .09 .23* * p &lt; .05. from families with more resources had higher scores on both cognitive measures. Relations between Food Intake and Family Characteristics One would expect that children raised in families with more economic and educational resources would be better nourished, and this was generally true. All the food intake vari- ables, except carbohydrates, were associated significantly with SES when the sample was pooled. More of the correlations were signifi- cant for the males than the females (see Table 3), although there were no significant differ- ences in the size of correlations between the two sexes. SES was most highly correlated with intakes of fat and animal protein. In other words, families with better economic and educational resources also provided their children with better nutrition. Given that food intake and SES were cor- related and both were associated with cogni- tive scores, the relative contribution of each is of interest. When SES was forced into the re- gressions with cognitive scores, all the food intake remained significantly associated with cognitive scores for the females (see Table 4). However, only fat and animal protein intakes were significantly correlated with cognitive score when SES was covaried for the males. The covaried correlations were not signifi- cantly different for the males and females, so the correlations were computed for the sam- ple as a whole. All the food intake variables were associated with cognitive score except level of carbohydrates when SES was co- varied for the whole sample. SES continued to be correlated with the cognitive scores for males and females even when food intakes were forced into the equation first. The correlations for fat and animal pro- tein are larger than for the other food intake measures. Fat intake was significantly more highly related to cognitive score than car- bohydrate intake, t(130) = 2.38, p &lt; .05, and overall energy intake, t(130) = 2.20, p &lt; .05. Classroom Behavior One of the important questions raised in this project was whether insufficient nutri- tional intake was associated not only with more limited cognitive abilities but also with distractibility and poorer ability to concen- trate on classroom lessons. To address this question, Pearson product-moment correla- tions were calculated between the mean of off-task behaviors over all observations and measures of food intake. There were no sig- nificant associations between percentage of time that the child was off task in the class- room and food intake for the males, but there were significant associations for the females. Girls with higher calorie, fat, protein, and animal protein intake levels were off task less than girls with lower levels of food intake (see Table 2). Thus, well-nourished females were more attentive in class, while malnourished females more frequently engaged in off-task behaviors. Duration of Schooling In order to compare differences as a func- tion of duration of schooling, cognitive scores for children in the higher grades were com- pared with cognitive scores for children in the lower grades. As hypothesized, children with TABLE 4 CORRELATION BETWEEN COGNITIVE SCORE AND FOOD INTAKE WITH SES COVARIED Females Males All (n = 60) (n = 73) (n = 133) kcal .................. ............. .37* .12 .18* Protein ........................... .39* .15 .21* Animal protein ...................... .29* .34* .31* Fat .............................. .44* .27* .31* Carbohydrate ........................ .30* .07 .13 SES (when food intake covaried) ..... .34* .37* .38* * p - .05.</page><page sequence="9">Sigman et al. 1471 TABLE 5 MEANS OF CHILDREN WHO VARIED IN LENGTH OF SCHOOLING LESS SCHOOL (n = 69) MORE SCHOOL (n = 61) M SD M SD Physical measures:a Height for age ................. -1.90 .98 - 1.42 1.00 Weight for age* ................ -1.61 .72 -2.24 .78 Weight for height* ............. -.49 .68 -.39 .63 Food intake: kcal (g/day)* ................... 1,416.82 244.91 1,512.71 232.62 Protein (g/day)* ................ 41.46 8.27 44.85 7.45 Animal protein (g/day)* ........ 2.13 1.34 3.38 2.54 Fat (g/day)* .................... 19.96 4.67 23.48 5.67 Carbohydrates (g/day) .......... 283.31 47.20 295.88 46.81 Family factors: SES* ...................... .... 85.13 14.21 97.33 16.36 Paternal literacy* .............. 5.83 4.26 8.21 4.20 Maternal literacy* .............. 3.40 3.58 5.81 4.21 Cognitive score* ............... -.68 1.10 1.10 1.33 a Physical measures reported as z score transformations using NCHS standards. * Significantly different for school groups, p &lt; .05. longer durations of schooling had higher cog- nitive scores, t(122) = 7.75, p &lt; .001. This did not seem attributable to selective promo- tion policies since the same effects were pres- ent when only the data for children promoted within the year were analyzed. The correla- tion between the duration of schooling and cognitive score was significant when age was covaried, r(121) = .60, p &lt; .001. However, the children with more schooling came from more prosperous families and were provided with more food according to three Hotelling's t tests calculated on the differences in food intake, physical stature, and family character- istics. Except for height and carbohydrates, comparisons of the individual variables were also significant (see Table 5). To determine whether duration of schooling contributed to cognitive scores re- gardless of age, physical stature, level of food intake, and family characteristics, a stepwise regression was calculated with the cognitive score as a dependent measure. The indepen- dent variables consisted of the anthropomet- ric, food intake, and family variables as well as the duration of schooling and mean age. Duration of schooling, mean intake of animal protein, weight for age, and SES entered into the regression, accounting for 54% of the vari- ance (see Table 6). Thus, the extent of school participation had an effect on cognitive abili- ties independent of the child's family back- ground and nutritional status. This analysis also indicated that a variety of factors includ- ing school experience, family economic re- sources, and nutritional adequacy all in- fluenced the cognitive skills of these children in rural Kenya. Discussion Food intake was clearly related to the cognitive skills of these Kenyan schoolchil- dren. Regardless of the social and economic resources of the family, children who had TABLE 6 MULTIPLE REGRESSION BETWEEN NUTRITIONAL MEASURES, FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS, AND DURATION OF SCHOOLING WITH COGNITIVE SCORES Variable R2 Added F p Duration of schooling .......... .33 89.93 .001 Animal protein ................ .13 36.33 .001 Weight for age ................. .05 13.87 .001 SES ........................... .03 9.49 .003 Total R2 ....................... .54</page><page sequence="10">1472 Child Development more adequate diets had higher scores on the cognitive battery than children with less ade- quate diets. These results are similar to our findings with the toddlers in this project (Sig- man, Neumann, Baksh, Bwibo, &amp; McDonald, in press) and with the toddlers in the Egyp- tian project (Wachs et al., 1988). Better-fed toddlers were more verbal, played more in the home setting, and showed more sophis- ticated play at 30 months than toddlers with less adequate diets. Moreover, fat and animal protein intakes between 18 to 30 months were related to scores on the cognitive battery described in this article which was adminis- tered in the Kenyan project to children at 5 years of age (Sigman, McDonald, Neumann, &amp; Bwibo, 1989). One of the important questions is the role of present nutrition in contrast to nutritional history. The fact that food intake at an earlier period is also related to cognitive scores sug- gests that the relation between food intake and performance in this sample of school-age children may reflect a process that has earlier roots. Considering their height and weight, at least some of the children in this sample may have had inadequate nutrition for most of their lives. Moreover, families appear to fur- nish similar levels of nutrition to children of different ages. For the 41 families with both a toddler and a schoolchild, energy intakes for the two children were correlated regardless of SES, r(39) = .61, p &lt; .01. The only counterevidence is the insig- nificant relation between height and cogni- tive score for the males since height is often used as an index of nutritional history. How- ever, this cannot be considered too strongly since the correlations for males and females were not significantly different, and height was correlated for the sample as a whole. Fur- thermore, we have found for our younger sample that length at 30 months was associ- ated with cognitive score at 5 years. Finally, the differentiation of weight and height as in- dices of present and past nutrition seems less useful in this sample where height continues to be affected by current nutrition. While all the food intake variables were associated with cognitive scores, fat intake ap- peared to be more important than carbohy- drate intake and overall energy intake. Fat may be important because it is a dense source of energy so that small differences have a large impact. Levels of animal protein were minimally associated with the other variables except fat, suggesting that animal protein added something to the diet, other than en- ergy. Although the possibility of essential amino acid deficiencies cannot be ruled out, it is more likely that animal protein (and per- haps fat as well) is serving as a marker of diets that contain adequate levels of associated mi- cronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. This is an area that needs more investi- gation. One of the important issues is the path through which undernourishment influences learning and cognitive development. One hy- pothesis is that chronic hunger may interfere with the child's capacity to attend and learn. Children who were marasmic in the first year of life have been reported to show increased attention problems during the school year in contrast to children with no history of malnu- trition (Galler, Ramsey, Solimano, &amp; Lowell, 1983). Moreover, food supplementation ap- pears to have had the most sustained effect on social-emotional development rather than cognitive development (Barrett et al., 1982). In order to address this issue, attentional be- havior in the classroom was observed. Well- nourished female schoolchildren were more attentive to classroom tasks than undernour- ished female schoolchildren. Thus, some girls may simply be too hungry to focus on school tasks, and this may interfere with their learn- ing. One of the major limitations in most stud- ies relating nutrition to behavior has been the confounding of nutritional and environmental factors. This study attempted to deal with this issue by separating the effects of nutritional factors from family characteristics, such as SES and parental literacy. The results showed that both nutritional factors and fam- ily resources were important for the chil- dren's cognitive scores. However, family eco- nomic, social, and educational resources are distal influences on the child, not proximal in- fluences, like family teaching or social in- teraction patterns. We decided not to observe home interaction patterns because, in pilot work, the school-age children appeared to spend their time out of school with peers and siblings, often wandering over large areas. In addition, they were very self-conscious about being observed in their family settings. Home observations were carried out with the tod- dlers, and caregiver behaviors were related to the children's cognitive and verbal skills (Sig- man et al., 1988), as was true in the Egyptian study (Wachs et al., 1988). However, food in- take appeared to influence cognitive develop- ment of the Kenyan toddlers independently</page><page sequence="11">Sigman et al. 1473 of the effects of the home environment (Sig- man et al., in press). Participation in school also seemed im- portant for the kinds of cognitive skills mea- sured in this study. Children who had at- tended school longer were from wealthier, better-educated families, as reported in other studies (Jamieson, 1986; Moock &amp; Leslie, 1986), but schooling was important regardless of family background. It is possible that families chose to send more verbally compe- tent children to school at earlier ages. Fur- thermore, schooling may make the children more familiar with the matching task and kinds of representations used in the verbal meaning test. Formal schooling is clearly not the only means for children to develop cogni- tive abilities in that children learn skills through other economic and social activities (e.g., Saxe, Guberman, &amp; Gearhart, 1987). However, schooling did appear to moderate the effects of nutrition on cognitive abilities. The strength of this school-duration mea- sure is surprising for several reasons. First, duration would appear to be a rather insensi- tive measure, and one would prefer to know something about the quality of the educa- tional experience. Second, in many less de- veloped countries, children may be enrolled in a particular grade but may not attend school consistently because they do not have school fees or are needed at home. For this reason, a measure of school attendance would be very useful. Unfortunately, our measure of school attendance is less complete than would be hoped. However, when the same afnalyses were conducted with the school at- tendance data available, similar results were obtained. There is a strong emphasis on school learning in Kenya at present. Because of the limited amount of arable land and very high birth rate (Kaplan, 1984), increasing numbers of people will have to earn their livelihoods in occupations other than farming. Parents, teachers, and national leaders aim to foster the kinds of cognitive abilities taught in schools in order to prepare children for alter- native employment. This study aimed to identify the kinds of environmental factors as- sociated with such cognitive abilities. The re- sults showed that all the factors studied- nutritional intakes, school participation, and family characteristics-were relevant. Well- fed children from more educated families who participated for longer periods in school were more skillful than undernourished chil- dren with less school experience from less educated families. Based on these findings, one would recommend interventions for pro- moting cognitive function that used a mul- tifactorial approach. References Agarwal, D. K., Upadhyay, S. K., Tripathi, A.
