<plain_text><page sequence="1">Primate Social Conflict , edited by William A. Mason and Sally P. Men- doza. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1993. 419 pp. $19.95 (paperback). Mason and Mendoza will not likely find any conflicting opinions about the value of this book. They propose that social conflict is not the sim- plistic concept so often described, and Primate Social Conflict dramat- ically portrays the complexity of conflict and aggression through detailed discussions of the changing character of conflict with gender, age, spe- cies, social stability, and endocrine state, to name a few factors. In gen- eral the chapters are well written and lead an audience of potentially limited understanding of particular topics into clearly constructed argu- ments that incorporate sufficient depth to support the proposed hy- potheses. Thus primatologists, anthropologists, social scientists, veteri- narians, and primate colony managers would all benefit from reading the book. Indeed, in a political climate that currently mandates social hous- ing for nonhuman primates housed in research facilities, reading the book is a must because social conflict will occur between nonhuman primates, and it becomes the scientist's, veterinarian's, and manager's task to min- imize the frequency and severity of such conflict. Although the book does not specifically provide recipes for avoiding or eliminating inter- individual conflict, it does provide numerous scenarios, causes, and mea- sures of conflict that can be used to develop a management strategy.</page><page sequence="2">186 / Book Reviews The general theme of demonstrating the complexity of social con- flict is well illustrated by the topics highlighted in each chapter and dis- cussed by experts in the field. Differences in conflict among females, among males, between mother and infant, under different foraging de- mands, and between pairs and rivals are described. Also, the physiology of dominance and reproductive suppression as an outcome of conflict are addressed. Parallels between human and nonhuman primate conflict and aggression are drawn in a thought-provoking manner, and the positive aspects of conflict as a cognitive stimulant and cultural glue are characterized. Mason and Mendoza offer a sound introduction to the topic by dis- cussing the proximate and ultimate causes and consequences of social conflict and the genetic influences on its occurrence. They share a prag- matic view of social conflict and discuss the positive and negative as- pects of this type of social interaction. They blend into the discussion a balance of both current and older references, thereby providing a thor- ough review of the subject. Mason furthers the discussion using a psycho- ethological approach in which he relates nonhuman primate conflict to human development theory, weaving together threads of human and non- human primate causes of conflict. Mason draws on human social sci- ences and fundamental biological principles, such as the competitive ex- clusion principle, to support the similarities between conflict in humans and nonhuman primates. Mason challenges the standard view of social conflict, which suggests that competition is the cause and aggression the result of conflict. Instead, he teases apart these three concepts to dem- onstrate their independence. Perhaps deliberately, Mason uses human descriptors to describe states in nonhuman primates (such as moods, in- difference, desires, and knowledge); however, this tendency can encum- ber other areas of research, such as "psychological well-being," which is already overburdened by anthropomorphic verbiage from Congress and the animal rights community. Mason poses a new hypothetical model to account for conflict (the minimax model) and neatly mixes terminology and concepts from other scientific fields to describe the "social valence" of an interaction. Primate colony managers should attend to Mason's discussion on intraindi vidual conflict, because a better understanding of the causes of this form of conflict can certainly lead to its reduction. Another outstanding chapter in the book is by Mendoza, who dis- pels the cut and dried notion that primate relationships are either affi- nitive or agonistic. Rather, Mendoza describes how qualities of rela- tionships are established in this discussion of first encounters. She summarizes the research on group formation and species differences in first encounters. The discussion could have been improved only by in- cluding more detail on pair formation. Mendoza clearly illustrates the importance that social history, equivalent or nonequivalent status of in-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews / 187 dividuals, species, and size of the social group have on the outcome of a first encounter. In addition, she reminds the reader that relationships can evolve so that the appearance of conflict (or lack of it) may change in character as the relationship becomes established. Primate Social Conflict is an amalgam of new hypotheses and re- search summaries. Three excellent chapters that fall into the latter cat- egory deal with reconciliation (F.B. De Waal), the physiology of dom- inance (R.M. Sapolsky), and reproductive suppression in marmosets and tamarins as a consequence of social conflict (D.H. Abbott). These three chapters are well grounded in objective data from numerous primate spe- cies that are used to support the conclusions and interpretations set forth. Alternative explanations for the observations are described and carefully eliminated. Cited references are thorough and relevant, and in some cases span over two decades of work. The contributors acknowledge that field data may be different from those collected from captive animals, even when some evidence is circumstantial. Each contributor proposes future areas of research as an endpoint to the "story" he is relating. Some chapters are also notable for their innovative interpretations of conflict. For example, C.R. Menzel examines conflict in callicebus in terms of travel decisions and location selection for certain activities. This view typifies the point made throughout the book that not all con- flict is violent or aggressive; rather, it can be subtle. Similarly, G. An- zenberger discusses conflict in the context of social attraction and pa- rental investment in the choice of remaining monogamous. Mason, Long, and Mendoza demonstrate a transactional approach to evaluating conflict in a relationship, using mother-infant conflict as the backdrop for this approach. Transactional analysis provides qualitative information about the interactions rather than simply defining the category of interaction. By this method, the authors are able to analyze social manifestations of temperament and to use conflict as an indicator of differences in temperament. D.M. Lyons rounds out this comprehensive discussion of conflict with his chapter on the constructive forces of conflict. Lyons builds on the prosocial aspects of the previous chapter by L. Tiger and outlines the principal differences between constructive and destructive conflict. Within this framework he superimposes examples of intraindividual, in- terindividual, and group conflict. He adroitly demonstrates the silver lin- ing of social conflict, noting the positive aspects of conflict where so many have focused only on the negative.</page><page sequence="4">188 / Book Reviews The book is well organized and fully addresses key issues related to the topic of social conflict from a number of research perspectives.
