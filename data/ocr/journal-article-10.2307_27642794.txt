Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007 Abstract Phenomenology of the body and the third generation of cognitive sci ence, both of which attribute a central role in human cognition to the body rather than to the Cartesian notion of representation, face the criticism that higher-level cognition cannot be fully grasped by those studies. The problem here is how explicit representations, consciousness, and thoughts issue from perception and the body, and how they cooperate in human cognition. In order to address this problem, we propose a research program, a cognitive phenomenology of the body, which is basically motivated by the perspective of Merleau-Ponty. We find a substantial clue in developmental psychological studies on the body and language. Since the early 1990s, there has been a growing interest in the body within cognitive science, which aims at scientifically clarifying the function of human mind. This remarkable phenomenon is one feature of the rise of what might be called "the third generation of cognitive science," which comprises robotics, the dynamical approach to recognition, cognitive semantics in linguistics, evolutionary psychology, the theory of autopoiesis, and so on.1 By contrast, the first generation of cognitive science is typically represented by classical artificial intelligence (AI), which implements an elementary kind of reasoning and cognition by assuming an explicit 1 Robotics here means research that is particularly in accord with James J.

Nagataki, S. Hirose symbol manipulation. The researchers belonging to this generation thought that local representations, which are explicit and symbolic, played an essential role in the human mind. The second generation is characterized by connectionism, in which the programs of neural networks imitating the brain activities took a leading part. Researchers of this second generation hold that distributed representations, which are inexplicit and pre-symbolic, are pivotal in human cognition. Why is the body relevant to the study of the human mind? Since the entrenchment of Cartesian dualism, the body and mind have been thought of as essentially distinct, and the former has been assumed to be irrelevant when considering how the human mind works. The first two generations of cognitive science also followed this line of thought. That is why some people criticized them for Cartesianism and laid great emphasis on the importance of human intelligence taking into account the phenomenon of embodiment. Hubert Dreyfus' What Computers Can't Do (1972) is a classic in this vein. He criticized AI studies of the first generation and connectionism against the background of phenomenological work such as that of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger. Dreyfus, however, responds favorably to the third generation studies that underscore the role of the body in human intelligence. He claims that the rise of the third generation of cognitive science bears out the validity of his critical appraisal as to the classical AI.2 References to Edmund Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty have appeared here and there in this research domain. One might say that this is a remarkable development in the history of cognitive science. Previously, phenomenological criticism against AI was made only from outside that research community and was never of concern within the field. Indeed, there remains a common assumption that phenomenology is not included in philosophical cognitive science. The aim of this paper is to undermine this assumption by searching for the possibility of cooperation between cognitive science and phenomenology on the basis of a theory of embodiment. We will call this combined effort "cognitive phenomenology of the body." In the following, we discuss several aspects of the historical interactions between the two. More specifically, we examine Cartesian thought, which the first generation of cognitive science inherited, and the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, who rightly criticized Ren? Descartes in relation to representation and body. Then we consider similarities between the problem which the third generation faces and the one that phenomenologists (especially Merleau-Ponty) made explicit. In the final section, we propose a research program, a cognitive phenomenology of the body, in which we discern a substantial clue in phenomenological and developmental psychological studies of the body and language. Cartesian Legacy to the First Generation of Cognitive Science The words at the opening of La Dioptrique suggest that vision is the model of the Cartesian theory of knowledge. Since vision is, he argues, the most general and ~ A personal conversation with Prof. Dreyfus. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="3">Phenomenology and the Third 221 noble, the invention which amplifies the power of vision must be the most useful. We will attain "the perfect knowledge" by using glasses (or telescopes) that extend the ability of the eye (Descartes 1963, p. 651). Indeed, as Don Ihde (2004) points out, Descartes employed a camera obscura to model his epistemology: If a room is quite shut up apart from a single hole, and a glass lens is put in front of the hole, and behind that, some distance away, a white cloth, then the light coming from external objects forms images on the cloth. Now it is said that this room represents the eye: the hole, the pupil; the lens, the crystalline humor ... this cloth is the internal skin made from terminals of optic nerve. (Descartes 1963, p. 686) The internal skin would be called "retina" in physiological terms. The image of an object reflected on the retina, though inverted, resembles the original, which Descartes also acknowledges. According to him, however, it is not the eye and retina, but the mind that sees objects in the external world. The image on the retina is transferred to the pineal body, or gland, known as the seat of common sense in the brain. It is, he argues in Les Meditations, the place where the mind and body are linked, namely the organ in which the mind receives sensory information from the external objects. It should be noted that the information (i.e., representations) gathered in the pineal body has little similarity with them. Similarity can provide an illusory sense of knowledge and so cannot be described as the cornerstone of epistemology. As Descartes (1963) put it, "when human beings notice a resemblance between things, they ascribe to each, even in those respects in which they differ, what they found true of the other" (p. 77). In La Dioptrique, he denied even resemblance between external objects and the representations of them. This means the refusal of the scholastic notion, esp?ces intentioneile s, which are supposedly like flakes coming from, and similar to, external objects. According to scholasticism, to recognize things is for the eyes (or mind) to receive those flakes which are their simulacrums. Descartes' conception of knowledge is combined with his mechanical theory of nature, which regards the world as written in mathematical symbols. Mechanical philosophers in the early modern era argued that the world is structured mathematically by God, so one must get acquainted with the language of mathematics in order to know the functioning whole. It is pretty reasonable for them to argue that similarities between objects and linguistic symbols which represent them should be denounced. For linguistic symbols are totally different from the shapes of objects (for example, the word "apple" has nothing similar to a real apple at all), and it is in terms of those symbols that our minds represent them. For those philosophers, mathematical symbols are supposed to represent the world and objects most truly and precisely. Along this line of thought, Descartes also worked out his theory of knowledge, which was, as is well known, based on the canonical discipline of mathesis universalis. "Descartes' critique of resemblance in the Rules is accompanied by the elaboration of a new definition of knowledge based on what he calls universal mathematics" (Judovitz 1988: p. 71). ? Springer</page><page sequence="4">222 S. Nagataki, S. Hirose One could say the belief that the world is written in mathematical symbols, inherited from Plato to Descartes through Galileo, took shape as computationalism, the theoretical prop of the first generation of cognitive science. Computationalism contends that a recognition process inside of the mind is an informational one, in which symbols are manipulated as if by a kind of computation. These symbols are mental representations which allegedly capture the world and have no relation to the body. Since the representations are taken on by well-defined symbols and mathematical formulas in this context, these are explicit. Thus the first generation of cognitive science assumed that objects like those in the external world are seized by explicit representations which have definite mathematical and symbolic structures. To recap, the first generation of cognitive science inherited two characteristics from Descartes: 1. Explicit representations which have nothing to do with the body. (We will call them "the disembodied representations.") 2. Mathematical and symbolic structures (or computational structures) which bear explicit representations. Consider, among other branches of the first generation of cognitive science, the research of AI, which seeks to explicate the human mind by actually replicating it. One of the tasks the early AI took up by choice was to develop chess programs capable of beating human players. Why did AI researchers choose to do so? One reason is that intelligent activities like playing chess were assumed to represent the very nature of human mind. It remains in our memories that IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, the chess grandmaster. He commented that he felt he was playing against "an alien intelligence" after finishing the match-up. Whatever he really meant to say, his expression was arguably right on target, because what Deep Blue did was just a calculation or manipulation of symbols, which was totally different from what Kasparov did. To put it strongly, the match was played between Deep Blue's ability of calculation and Kasparov's intuition. For a great player like Kasparov there can be a move, made without knowing what makes him/her choose it, which nevertheless proves to be extremely insightful. It can only be described as a stroke of genius that prompted him/her to do so. The kind of intelligence realized by computer programs does not have the same sort of implicit intuition as Kasparov's. They just calculate as many moves as possible up to the limit of physical resources. Thus the meaning of every move they made-the reason why it must be chosen-is explicit in that it is the result of a well-defined computational procedure. What a chess program deals with is a particular tractable space in which the course of events is guided by explicit rules. This is another reason why so much effort has been put into developing chess programs in AI research. AI has succeeded considerably in making programs which deal with a limited and simple micro world, namely a set of events whose whole course is regulated by explicit rules, illustrated by a chess game or the set of configurations of solid figures constructed by blocks. They also have developed many kinds of dialogue programs dealing with specific subjects. There have been some dialogue programs which passed the Turing test, for some people were mistaken for programs where narrowly 4y Springer</page><page sequence="5">Phenomenology and the Third 223 constrained topics were concerned. The basic assumption AI researchers held was that the actual world we live in could be identified with a set of micro worlds. They thought that a micro world was a basic unit of the world, and that one could get perfect knowledge about the world by understanding how to constitute it with them. Here we cannot help thinking of the methodology of analysis and synthesis, a cornerstone of modern natural science, which has its roots in ancient mathematics and of which Galileo made good use in his natural philosophy. AI researchers of the first generation partially took over this methodology and what goes with it-a modern European world-view, according to which the whole course of things in the universe could in principle be predicted or retrodicted by means of mechanics. However, chess games or blocks worlds are not part of the world but are artificial micro worlds.5 Parts of the world are always linked to the world as a whole because, as Merleau-Ponty (1964a) put it, "when I perceive, I am, through my point of view, in the world as a whole, nor am I even aware of the limits of my visual field" (p. 329). The Turn to Embodiment It was a "cogito," or a thinking subject, that built up the foundations of the philosophy of consciousness. Descartes thought of consciousness as distinctively different from the material world and established the absolute certainty of its existence. By disembodying consciousness, a human body as well as the external world came to be regarded as mere machines and nonessential to mental activities. Furthermore, the way in which they operate was, in his conception, ruled by definite natural laws and thus susceptible of comprehension by consciousness with explicit representations. Ever since then the human body had virtually disappeared as a theme of philosophical discourse until the 20th century when phenomenology emerged as a new movement. There is a sense, however, in which Descartes regarded a human body as a special object different from other physical ones. For nature teaches us, he said, that our own bodies are intricately linked with our own minds (Descartes, 1967, p. 492). The fact that the mind and body were united was, for Descartes, an aporia not solvable from his perspective. Indeed, the mind-body problem has posed a supreme challenge to the philosophy of consciousness. Merleau-Ponty addressed this problem from a phenomenological viewpoint, in which the conception of the body as a mere machine was rejected. Under the influences of the later Husserl, who developed the theory of kinesthesia and generative phenomenology, Merleau-Ponty elevated the body to the main theme in philosophy. He said, "our [twentieth] century has wiped out the dividing line between 'body' and 'mind,' and sees human life as through and through mental and corporeal" (1964b, pp. 226f). He objected to the basis of the philosophy of consciousness, an assumption that only the mental or consciousness is the essence of humankind, and thereby heralded the advent of the new conception of body. One 4 See, for example, Patricia S. Churchland, 1995, chap. 9. 5 See Preface to the second edition (1979) of Dreyfus (1972), pp. 13f. ?Spri nger</page><page sequence="6">224 S. Nagataki, S. Hirose could refer to it as "the embodiment turn" in the history of philosophy as a counter to Rorty's "linguistic turn". What, then, is the body as a new philosophical theme? To use Merleau-Ponty's framework, two distinctions can be made: "the phenomenal body" and "the objective body." The former is, according to him, what should be called "the subject of perception" (Merleau-Ponty 1964a, pp. 206, 309n). It projects by its intentionality "a certain 'setting' round itself" (p. 232), and is essentially lived by and experienced from within by oneself. Others' bodies can also be phenomenal ones insofar as they have intentionality. By contrast, an objective body is subject to physical laws, and thus is the object of medical science and physiology. "The objective body is not the true version of the phenomenal body, that is, the true version of the body that we live by. It is no more than the latter's impoverished image" (p. 431). Obviously, the central concern of phenomenology is the phenomenal body, while the objective body is not the body in its proper meaning. These notions, however, should not be regarded as being opposed to and exclusive of each other. For it is true that the phenomenal body cannot be reduced to a mere thing (res) in Cartesian meaning, but it has the same properties that a thing has. Put another way, the phenomenal body implies some aspects of the objective one. Merleau-Ponty did not pay much attention to this fact when distinguishing them clearly.6 The true version of the body is also called a "natural self" (Merleau-Ponty 1964a, p. 206). The self in the customary sense is a Cartesian pure consciousness, which is transparent to itself and accompanied by explicit representations. The body takes a position between a pure thing (res extensa) and a pure consciousness (res cogitans)\ the body has properties as natural things do, and also has an intentional transcendental function that projects the world and gives it a sense. It is, however, different from the intentionality which a pure consciousness has, for the intentionality of the body is beneath the intentionality of disembodied represen tations or a pure consciousness, and therefore tacit and inexplicit. The ability of sense-giving which the former has is called "I-Can," opposed to the Cartesian "I-Think" ability. Thus, for example, we can grip a coffee cup in front of us, or we can walk on foot, without relying on explicit representations. A proficient organist can play difficult tunes or improvise a chord progression without representing the keyboard explicitly. Perhaps one would explicitly represent each and every one of the keys when initially learning how to play the organ. But once the skill is acquired as a habit, it is incorporated into the musician's body as tacit knowledge. In this sense, the body is "the basic habit" (p. 91) for acquiring various habits. To put it differently, it is a flexible organ which gives senses to the world. 6 The fact that Merleau-Ponty distinguished between "the phenomenal body" and "the objective body" in Phenomenology of Perception does not mean that he was committed to some kind of ontological dualism. In fact, his earlier writings generally lack ontological considerations. They only come into the picture in the later works, such as The Visible and the Invisible, in which he embraces a somewhat esoteric ontology of flesh (see, for example, Barbaras 2004). It suffices, however, to say that, for the present purpose of explicating the relationship between cognition and representation, there is no need to dwell on ontological problems, much less the necessity of adopting Merleau-Ponty's peculiar stance on that matter. ?? Spri nger</page><page sequence="7">Phenomenology and the Third 225 As we pointed out above, the world which AI in the Cartesian tradition could deal with was a mere micro world. What is, then, needed for AI to proceed from a micro world to the real world? In order to clarify this, AI researchers turned to the body, trying to develop humanoid robots, soccer robots and the like. These artifacts are called an intelligence with its own body or an embodied intelligence. For an embodied intelligence, they think, the world is not a mere object of thought but the place where it can move around and see and touch things. The world becomes perspectival through a viewpoint of each robot's body-it is not the kind of disembodied world as seen through a god-like researcher's eyes. With the rise of interest in the body, a new idea appeared in cognitive science at the end of the last century: AI and computer science researchers are getting to know that the body is indispensable for creating a sort of intelligence, because if an intelligence is mounted into a humanlike body, then it can interact with the outer environment ["world" in our terminology] as a human does. As a result, it is anticipated that the intelligence will be like human's. (Asada, Ishiguro, &amp; Kuniyoshi, 1999, p. 3) We will describe the relationship between intelligence and the body in cognitive science, taking this thesis into account in some detail. In the first place, human intelligence appeared and has evolved by way of getting optimally adapted to the world, and the interaction with it takes place through the body. This fact restricts the way we get information from the environment, for humans recognize things as just a part of the world because they have bodies. In fact, restriction by having a body essentially defines the nature of human beings, and therefore is indispensable for humanlike intelligence to emerge in a certain artificial system. At the same time, in order to recognize a humanlike intelligence in a particular system, it is necessary for us to communicate with that system; to figure out intuitively what it feels and intends to do. For that purpose, a system must have a body which is basically isomorphic to that of a human. This argument could be interpreted as a manifesto of anti-cartesianism in a philosophical context, and that is just the reason why we call this the "embodiment turn" in cognitive science. As Andy Clark points out, there are two different methods within the trend to set importance on the body in cognitive science. The first is called "simple embodiment," which treats features of the body and its interaction with the environment as constraints upon a theory of inner organization and processing. The second, which is called "radical embodiment," goes much further and treats such facts as profoundly altering the subject matter and theoretical framework of cognitive science. Clark (1999) writes; "the distinction between the simple and the radical forms is, however, not absolute, and many (perhaps most) good research programs end up containing elements of both" (p. 348). But most researchers who apparently take the radical form criticize the view which appoints inner organization and processing made by explicit inner representations as the leading part of cognition. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="8">226 S. Nagataki, S. Hirose What to do with Representations? As research which emphasized the importance of embodiment became more prevalent, some people began to think that the concept of representation, which had held the lead in cognitive science, would be useless for explicating human intelligence. Such an assertion is repeatedly made by those working under the slogan of "radical embodiment." Rodney Brooks' famous paper, "Intelligence without Representation" (1991), was a pioneering work in that field. There are two reasons to criticize the notion of representation. The first is that once we adopt it, we must hold that human cognition about objects (or the world) is apart from objects themselves (or the world itself), because representation functions as a kind of filter between them. Recall the fact that Cartesian epistemology objected to the scholastic notion of esp?ces intentionelles, which allegedly comes from objects into the human mind, and denied resemblance between objects and representations. What discon nects the mind from the external world is the very concept of representation rooted in the Cartesian tradition, in which the mind was assumed to have no place in the material world. The second point of criticism is that human cognition and action (especially that which takes place automatically and without explicit consciousness) are inexplicable by a traditional linear model of cognition, for which a human makes a representation of an object in the world, makes an inference (i.e., performs a complex computation) on the basis of the representation, judges it, and then starts on a course of action (for example, instructing the body where to go). Consider the case in which an outfielder catches a fly ball. The traditional model deploying the notion of representation explains that her/his brain (or mind) performs (or represents) complicated calculations of the parabola, acceleration and distance of the ball, and then instructs her/his body where it will land. However, this model forces the brain to do too much complex information processing, and therefore is not efficient. By contrast, Michael McBeath and others (1995) suggested that the brain uses a computationally simpler strategy. According to this model, the outfielder continually adjusts her/his movement towards the ball in the air, assuming that it appears to move in straight line in the player's visual field, not to curve towards the ground. By maintaining this strategy, the fielder can get to the right place at the right time to catch the ball. What is involved here is not action based on information which is pre-calculated and represented throughout, but rather a real time adjustment of her/his course of action. As the illustration of an outfielder suggests, human cognition is seen not as a sequential cyclic (perceive-think-act) process, but rather as a matter of continual co-ordination dynamics between the subject and the object, or a dynamical coupling between them. This "radical embodiment" position argues that the representation is unnecessary and even useless in this model. In fact, it seems to allow us to explain most of our cognition and action.7 Thus it is no wonder that some people go so far as to say that once the body as medium directly interacts with the world, representation is a mere fifth wheel for intelligence. They think that the Cartesian mind-body problem and homunculus problem could be avoided by throwing representation away. The origin 7 Gibsonian affordance theory also strongly supports this model. See Gibson (1978). 4y Springer</page><page sequence="9">Phenomenology and the Third 227 of these problems is, they say, the very use of this concept, whether explicit or inexplicit, for it inevitably leads to the demarcation between inner representations and the external world, and thus posits yet another subject, homunculus, who connects them. Is it then the case that no kinds of representation are used in simple and automatic cognition and action-in a "simple level intelligence" in the terminology of Rodney Brooks (1991)? Researchers like Brooks and Timothy van Gelder (1995) treat the notion of representation as useless, while Dana Ballard and Ruth Millikan admit special kinds of representation in such human cognition: "just-in-time representa tion" (Ballard et al. 1997, p. 739) and "pushmi-pullyu representation" (Millikan 1995, p. 186). According to Millikan, "pushmi-pullyu representation" is descriptive and yet directive. Clark argues that this kind of representation has the functions of encoding objects in the world and controlling action (Clark 1995, p. 95). In short, it is importantly different from the traditional conception of representation as something which just describes or encodes objects. Though called "representation," it involves a coupling of a subject and the world. Actually, it is not easy to decide whether representations are used in relatively low-level cognition and action. People are divided on whether one can find representations at that level. Even if one could spot some kind of representations there, it is still unclear what significance one could rightly attach to that decision. On the other hand, there is an intuition that the more direct the coupling, the less space for representation. Even Clark, who is in favor of this concept, thinks that whether lower level cognition and action are "genuinely non-representational and non-computational, or suggestive of different kinds of representation ('action oriented representations') and more efficient form of computation, is a difficult question whose resolution remains uncertain" (1999, p. 346). At least, it should be noted that part of cognition and action in human beings do not depend on explicit representations, and that higher and more abstract level cognition must be formed on the basis of them. This is just the idea which phenomenologists have repeatedly put forward and of which recent developmental psychology shows approval (Karmiloff-Smith 1992). Moreover, lower level cognition and action are more evolutionarily basic (Clark 1995, p. 100). If we take the strategy of concentrating on a dynamical coupling between the body and the world, we would be assured that the idea above is on the right track. The efficiency of such a strategy is guaranteed by Merleau-Ponty, who disclosed the limits of the philosophy of consciousness from a phenomenological viewpoint.8 8 Dreyfus (2004) focuses on the argument, which the earlier Merleau-Ponty advanced, that the basic sort of intelligent behavior, or skillful coping, can be understood without recourse to representation. He then argues that simulated neural networks provide a theoretical model which allows us to understand how this is possible. Obviously, the task he addresses is very important when trying to give an account of the way our cognition works. However, such studies should be complemented with the investigations dealing, firstly, with more advanced behavior which invariably involves mental representations, and secondly with the way how cognition without representation joins up with cognition of representation-hunger level. The latter problem?"by what miracle a created generality, a culture, a knowledge come to add to and recapture and rectify the natural generality of my body and the world" (Merleau-Ponty 1968, p. 152)? forms one of central themes in Merleau-Ponty's later works. ? Spri nger</page><page sequence="10">228 S. Nagataki, S. Hirose The more important problem is to clarify how to proceed from the lower or simpler level of human cognition and action to the higher conscious one, namely the "representation-hungry" (Clark 1999, p. 347) level. Consider the case of an outfielder again. Indeed, her/his simple action of catching a fly ball, which is performed almost automatically, could be explained in terms of dynamical coupling between the player and the world. But the fielder should have explicit represen tations about her/his future course of action after catching a fly ball and about others' intentions, such as a third runner's will to tag the home base. Put simply, human cognition is multi-leveled, while animal cognition is tied closely with its present environment and thus mono-leveled. It is highly improbable and implausible that carnivorous animals wandering in search of prey have explicit representations of their babies waiting for them at their nests. If one is tempted to think so, it is mere anthropomorphism. Animal cognition is, as it were, always "on line," that is, sticking to its environment. According to Michael Tomasello (1999), only humans can understand conspecifics' intentions and therefore human cognition is more complex than that of animals (Tomasello 2001, 2003a, b). The cognitive abilities specific to humans are extremely useful in mastering skills like using complicated tools and languages and in developing culture. This fact suggests that human cognition is not fully explicable in terms of dynamical coupling. Brooks' conception of intelligence without representation is enthusiastically embraced by Gibsonians since the theory of affordance, which denies the internal processing in cognition, is highly in accord with his claim. Some researchers, however, disbelieve in the value of his work, making fun of his insect-like mobile robot, named "Creature," as a "cockroach intelligence" (Takeda et al. 2002, p. 176). They say that Brooks is pretending just to have reached the moon, though he in fact went up a tree. Actually, Merleau-Ponty faced similar criticism to that made of Brooks. The originality of his phenomenology of embodiment, compared with Husserl's idealistic discipline, lies in deflating the explicit representations and consciousness; he attempted to attribute to the body the whole role of Husserl's transcendental subjectivity, including "representation hungry" cognition. And just because of it, his theory was criticized as "phenomenology without a head" (Madison 1973, p. 238). Some argued that he could not give a satisfactory solution to the problem of mediating between the concrete character of perceptional cognition (i.e., a lower level cognition in the present text) and the abstract character of intellectual cognition (i.e., a higher level cognition), because he attributed too much to the body (Tilliette 1970, p. 83). Indeed, he showed that the origins of the intellectual or scientific cognition are in perception, which is one of the finest contributions of phenomenology of embodiment. The whole of human cognition, however, cannot be explained in terms of a constitutional-cognitive function specific to the body.9 As suggested above, philosophy and cognitive science face a similar problem after the embodiment turn: how do explicit representations, consciousness and 9 The epithet "phenomenology without a head" would be unjustified if given to his thought as a whole, for he was well aware of that problem and thus went on to think about the linkage between perception and language in his later years, recognizing that thought and language could not be reduced to embodiment. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="11">Phenomenology and the Third 229 thoughts issue from perception and body, and how do they cooperate in human cognition? Even if human cognition is regarded as a dynamic coupling between the body, which is equipped with intentionality, and the world, the task of explaining the cognition of a higher, or a representation-hungry level as experienced, still remains to be accomplished. Towards a Cognitive Phenomenology of the Body In spite of the great differences in their methodology and ontology, phenomenology of the body and the third generation of cognitive science are confronted with the same type of problem. We believe that a possible way out should be sought by considering the suggestions from both fields, as well as having recourse to recent developmental psychology.10 Moreover, if one is to explicate the mechanism of human cognition, it would be necessary and instructive to consult the history of ontogenesis of humans. This is just the task of our research program, a cognitive phenomenology of the body. We will give a brief description of how the problem is approached from its perspective. Underlining the role of the body in human cognition would mean two things: the devaluation of the concept of representation in research, and changing the traditional understanding of the body itself. Both phenomenology and the third generation of cognitive science are acutely aware of these. For example, Merleau Ponty (1964a) wrote that the body has a "deeper intentionality beneath intentionality of representations" (p. 121), and thus is not a mere machine as Descartes thought, but has an ability to give sense to the world. Clark (1999) and Brooks (2002) recognize the importance of close links between the body and intelligence. Yet those insights would not yet be enough to resolve the hard problem of explicating cognition at a higher, representational level and the linkage between lower-level and higher-level cognition. For that purpose, more would be needed than just recognizing that the body plays an important role for the spread of culture and social interactions. Put another way, it is necessary to grasp the emergence and development of embodied cognition not just in the biological and psychological, but also in the social context. Only through this way could one answer to the criticisms of "cockroach intelligence" or "phenomenology without a head." It is just here that we need to consider the function of language in our cognition. The reason why language plays an important role for "representation-hungry" cognition is that the intersubjective and perspectival nature of linguistic symbols removes representations from the perceptual situation at hand (Clark 1999, p. 350; Tomasello 2003a, p. 53). Perception is typically momentary and private, while linguistic expressions are something repeatable and communicable, which is essential to the accumulation and transmission of culture, as well as to social 10 Developmental psychology deeply informed Merleau-Ponty's writings when he addressed problems about perception, body, representation and language, and also inspires the work of researchers of the third generation of cognitive science like Clark and Brooks. 4?

Thus we would get a clue to the solution of this difficult problem by giving a concrete description of the relationship between body and language. To use a locution of evolutionary psychologists and sociobiologists, human beings have both a biological and cultural inheritance, and language typifies the latter (Tomasello 1999, pp. 15, 53). However, they are not inherited separately. Biological inheritance specific to humans is a necessary condition for receiving cultural inheritance, as evidenced by the fact that autism which is caused by a biological deficit prevents her/him from understanding others' intentions (Baron Cohen 1995). Without those understandings, it would be impossible to affiliate with the lineage of culture, for this inheritance is not automatically successful but is learned in certain social circumstances. As Tomasello (2001) puts it, "learning new words is dependent on young children's ability to perceive and comprehend adult intentions in a very flexible manner using many different types of social-pragmatic information" (p. 137). This ability makes young children not only repeat others' bodily actions, but also imitatively learn others' bodily actions. Imitation should be distinguished from chimpanzees' emulation, in which not others' intentions, but the goal of others' behavior (for example, obtaining certain objects) matters (Tomasello 1999, pp. 29f, 3If, 39, 8If). It is implausible, however, that younger children who have not acquired language yet have explicit representations and reflective comprehension about others' intentions. Probably they do not quite clearly comprehend the reason why they imitate others' behaviors and words. Those imitative behaviors are, in fact, based on the intentionality of the body, which enables them to comprehend unconsciously others' intentions which are expressed behaviorally. In short, the body is an expressive space, and the expressions therein are grasped by its intentionality.12 A child, while perceiving and dealing with external objects, soon becomes aware of the presence of others' bodies. It begins to realize that they perceive things in much the same way as he or she. Tomasello (2003a) argues that the origins of language should be located in this form of social cognition, that is, what is known as "joint attention" among developmental psychologists. Joint attention is a primitive kind of cognition operative subconsciously at the level of the intentionality of the body. It is apparently opposed to higher-level cognition based on our linguistic abilities, such as an understanding of others' intentions. There seems to be a significant gap between them. However, a germinal understanding of others' intentions can be found in joint attention, and the former can be viewed as a natural extension of the latter by means of language. Thus, for this reason, to explicate the 1 ' More specifically, when we have joint attention or read others' intentions without linguistic communication, perceptions come to assume a quasi-public character, which will provide a requisite for the emergence of language. 12 Tomasello does not refer to embodiment when he considers the relationship between young children's ability to comprehend adult intentions and their language acquisition. Nevertheless, he puts forward valuable suggestions for approaching the challenge that confronts the phenomenological studies of the body and the third generation of cognitive science, that is, the task of explicating the linkage between higher- and lower-level cognitions. ?

This is the reason why we can understand others' intentions naturally. I can perceive the other's intentions and affections on the basis of direct correspondence between my own body and the other's body. I can recognize affections, such as anger, depression, delight and the like, in the other's gaze and facial expressions, because the other's body has its own inside, and meaning is disclosed there (Merleau-Ponty 1964a, pp. 197f). But such isomorphic correspondence is not specific to humans. Why, then, have only humans developed the ability to read others' intentions? One reason is that human bodily expressions are more complicated and richer than those of other animals. Thus, a person's intention or mind resides in the details of her/his actions, facial expressions and tones of voice, and another person, even a child, can directly perceive them. "The knitting of the brows intended, according to Darwin, to protect the eye from the sun, or the narrowing of the eyes to enable one to see sharply, become component parts of the human act of meditation, and convey this to an observer" (Merleau-Ponty 1964a, p. 194). In short, others' bodies have a social context. Since bodily expressions are quite varied and complicated, a conscious reasoning about the other's intention, which belongs to the level of representation-hungry cognition, emerges as a language is acquired. In order to develop a cognitive phenomenology of the body, one must recognize that the body is the subject of cognition in not only the dimension of perception but of social interaction. Furthermore, it would be necessary to give an elaborate description of how nature and culture are conjugated, as is realized in the body. For that purpose, a meticulous comparison should be made between the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, which takes perception, action, intention, language and thought as expressions of the body, with the approach to language by the third generation of cognitive science.14 If we can bring the knowledge from such investigations into the field of robotics and dynamical approach to cognition, a cognitive phenomenology of the body will become a fruitful program, and a more comprehensive understanding of how human cognition works will be available.
