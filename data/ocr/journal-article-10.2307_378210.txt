<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Comment on "Of Brains and Rhetoric" My wife told me to read Jeffrey Walk- er's Of Brains and Rhetorics (CE, Mar. 1990), so please pardon my unin- vited critique: Good news that the educated public is starting to realize that what we do about our brains will determine the fu- ture of homo sap. sap. and the bio- sphere. Sad news that an Assistant Professor of English at a prestigious university in the USA has only anach- ronisms to support his impressions of what goes on in brain research and ap- plication in the 1980-90s, to wit: "Biopsychology/Psychobiology" was the name of the game until around 1970; "neurology" was always a bio- medical, therapeutic and clinical branch of applied "neurophysiology." Since 1970 the name of the game has</page><page sequence="2">230 College English been Neuroscience and its interfaces with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Since 1970 AI has evolved into NEURAL NETWORKS modeling &amp; applica- tions-especially ATTRACTOR NEU- RAL NETWORKS PAANN) &amp; NEU- ROBOTICS. The explicit aim of these two latter research ventures is to create more anthropomorphic AI and control-computation for robotics; the bulk of their FUNDING comes from military and industrial sources, of course. The intellectual base of AI, ANN, and neurobotics is theoretical physics and its applications to biophysics. It is therefore mathematical and currently at the front of new developments in mathematical enquiry and application. A sound background in relativistic quantum dynamics is necessary for un- derstanding what is going on; many traditional "neuroscientists" (like this one, originally schooled in Greek, Lat- in and Euclid plus sensory neurophysi- ology and neurosurgery since the time of Galen, Penfield and Sherrigton) did not have this essential background, which dates only from the start of this century; they are now trying to make up their deficit. This means bringing "neuroscience" out of the pre-Newto- nian era into the post-Einstein era. Walker's ideas about brain research date from this "pre-Newtonian" era and would only raise patronizing smiles at the Carnegie Mellon or MIT. To borrow his quaint terminology, brain research is almost all about the "neural lexicon" these days. The important issue is that, in this "Decade of the Brain" (Society for Neuroscience of USA nomination), the general public should be reliably and accurately informed (or at least in- formable) about what is actually going on in brain research. I'm afraid Jeffrey Walker's scholarly article suggests that the public is twenty years or more out of date.

Perhaps the real question becomes whether there is any future for humans on this planet or in this universe (see especially Reference 4 for nightmares and Reference 5 for some consola- tions). Jeffrey Walker should be con- gratulated least for trying to demolish the hoary old populist myth about left and right halves of brains; this was never taken seriously by any neuro- scientist worthy of the name. Tell him not to browse in old back numbers of magazines like Psychology Today (now defunct, I sincerely hope!). He should stick to Nature and Science.
