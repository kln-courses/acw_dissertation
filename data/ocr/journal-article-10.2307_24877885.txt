Is it more than a convenient way of logging fortuitous finds? From a newcomer's viewpoint, AG may look hard to put into focus. Why does new information about landscapes and material culture matter? After all, don't we already know a great deal about the remote past of Greece? Aren't museums already full of attractive and interesting things? Do we need more of the same? Sometimes it pays to play devil's advocate: to stand back, observe what is going on and to take stock. If we want to have a short answer to the above questions, we need go no further than the Newsround section of AG. This year, David Smith bookends the section with key developments that have at least regional, arguably global significance. At one end, we have new data on the presence of early hominids in the Aegean and, at the other end, the report of a 16th-century Spanish galleon from the era of Philip II and the first evidence of a Minoan shipwreck across the Aegean from Crete itself. Our understanding of the anatomical development and spread of hominids and the initial dispersal of anatomically modern humans is still limited, in comparison with subsequent periods. Within the last decade, research on hominids has taken a huge leap forward. Theoretical approaches to the evolution of bipedal mobility and speech have been matched by the investigation of new sites and shelters. Greece has provided some key evidence of Middle Pleistocene activity, at a time when the topography of the central Aegean was dominated by a different landmass: 'Cycladia'. Hominid communities are now known to have made flakes and blades from a rich source of chert on Stélida hill, Naxos. The same outcrop was once again exploited during the Early Holocene, when Mesolithic people crossed over the sea that had emerged following the retreat of the ice sheet. Among other significant Pleistocene finds, there are stone tools from Kokkinopilos, west of the Pindos range, belonging to the Middle, if not Lower Palaeolithic, and the first open-air hominid settlement known to date in mainland Greece, at Marathousa near Megalopolis in the west-central Peloponnese. In the vicin ity of Samarina, western Macedonia, a string of sites spanning the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene extends the canvas for the scope of our Palaeolithic ancestors on the Greek peninsula. If we want to understand just how radical the Neolithic transition was from a mixed protein diet of marine resources and small game, to one of sheep and goat meat, then the latest publication of faunal data from Franchthi Cave, in the Argolid, offers what looks like a very clear pattern. Diet, this time in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, forms one of the themes of this year's report on the work of the British School at Athens. Catherine Morgan draws attention to the deposits of crushed murex (Hexaplex trun culus) at Palaikastro, Crete, and at Lefkandi, Euboea, which are thought to reflect the consumption of these marine molluscs, rather than their use in dyeing processes (although the latter function is not entirely ruled out). One of this year's Fitch Laboratory projects has focused on a well-documented Early Myce naean zooarchaeological assemblage from Thebes, recovered in 2008. It includes both domesticated and wild species, with comparatively elderly sheep and goat samples, suggestive of the procurement of sec ondary products (wool and hair), rather than meat. Returning to the Newsround, we discover the wealth of Mycenaean funerary data that has recently emerged from Attica, including several sites in the Mesogaia, as well as the coastal plains (Brauron and Vari). The discovery of a Late Helladic settlement and cemetery at Rema Xydias, near Platamonas, east of Mount Olympus, offers a northern parallel to the Attica finds that will encourage scholars to think again about the ways in which the Aegean area is conceived culturally, socially and historically in the Late Bronze Age. doi: 10.1017/S0570608415000022 Archaeological Reports 61 (2014-2015) 1-5</page><page sequence="2">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 When readers browse successive editions of AG, trends begin to emerge. These are a reflection not only of development work and exploration within the physical boundaries of the modern Greek state, but also of the intellectual interests and preoccupations of researchers working in Greece. Continuing the the matic trend of last year's volume, the contents of AG 61 develop some of the topics from AG 60, including a focus on the built environment of the area around the Piraeus harbour. Chryssanthi Papadopoulou looks at the relationship between quarrying activity and residential structures, including water cisterns. She brings together the results of development projects and systematic research, to show a distinctive and hitherto poorly understood dimension of Athens' harbour region. Much of the evidence reported dates from the Classical and Hellenistic periods, but it is worth noting that there is now a growing body of evi dence for Roman Piraeus, including activities that may be classified as Late Antique. There is evidence of continued use of facilities in and around Kantharos harbour, but also new commercial construction in the Imperial Age. The relationship between harbours and the commercial activities that took place in their vicinity is the subject of Mantha Zarmakoupi's chapter that explores recent research on the city and emporion of Hel lenistic and Roman Delos. Students of Delian archaeology are familiar with the structures in and around the principal harbour, through which visitors came to the Sanctuary of Apollo, located immediately north of the port. A series of key research projects, conducted under the auspices of the École française d'Athènes, has, over the last decade, thrown considerable light on several less well-known areas, which were never theless crucial to the island's commercial activities, notably the Agora of Theophrastos, just west of the port, the Agora of the Competaliasts, east of the port, as well as workshops in the Lake district, northwest of the Sanctuary of Apollo, and in the direction of Skardhana bay, which, together with the port, occupied the southwestern corner of the island. Zarmakoupi also provides her own data on the very latest underwater research in the Stadion District, where submerged storage and port facilities have been identified. The cumulative data from these different projects show how we might conceive a large-scale emporion in oper ation. There is a physical dimension to the commercial focus of Delos, but it is a distributed one. There is also an abstract dimension, accessible in part from epigraphic documents pertaining to the regulation of commercial exchanges, but manifested also in the kinds of behaviours that can be analysed from finds of storage facilities. Among the distinctive architectural manifestations of commercial traffic are various types of storage structures, including the 'mezzanine' storage loft, but also the combined house and merchant's office, or workshop, a form of accommodation that Zarmakoupi links to central Italian customs. AG 61 contains only one chapter dedicated to a prehistoric topic, Matthew Haysom's review of recent research into Minoan extra-mural sanctuaries. The publication of finds from several well-known sanctuary sites makes this a particularly timely review. One of the surprising discoveries arising from monographs on Vrysinas and Kophinas is that votives from these locations concentrate so markedly in the Neopalatial period. Whilst it is the Early Iron Age material from Kato Syme Viannou that has taken pride of place in recent publications and analogous material at the Idean Cave that puts this site firmly in the ranks of major Greek sanctuaries of the first millennium BC, the Bronze Age evidence is beginning to acquire greater coherence amongst the island's growing number of cult sites. The number of known Bronze Age sanctu aries on Crete has increased within the central parts of the island, but also to the west of Knossos as well as to the east. Pride of place this year goes to a series of reports that concentrate on epigraphic finds and what these documents tell us about ancient societies. Robert Pitt reports on a string of discoveries that link up with the Archaic and Classical history of Athens, as well as its Hellenistic and Roman past. One particularly intriguing find is the discovery, at 32 Tripodon Street, of an inscription that contains references to pry taneion and prytaneis. This is all the more intriguing because the same text also refers to the use of dining vessels. In view of the close proximity of the foundations of a large public building and of a cache of dining debris, perhaps from public dining, the case for the Archaic Prytaneion to have been located east of the Classical agora seems better substantiated than ever before. Other intriguing new finds include a list of names engraved on a black-glazed cup from Kiphissia, which includes Aristeides, Arriphron and Perikles, as well as a graffito from Plaka naming 'Mirana' (Murrina?). These items will doubtless stimulate 2 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="3">Introduction &amp; overview discussion amongst historians. Why should Aristeides ('the Just') appear in the same breath as the brothers Arriphron and Perikles - surely the two sons of Xanthippos, the Athenian politician, but at least a gener ation younger than Aristeides? Choosing from the rich diet that Pitt offers is invidious, but I must refer, however briefly, to the rock inscriptions from rural Attica, which offer drawings and snatches of verse as well as challenges to other shepherds with writing skills. Fabienne Marchand complements last year's survey of recent research in Boeotia, with a look at recent epigraphic research in Phokis, Lokris and Euboea. There is a crop of inscriptions that illuminates the organization of sanctuaries on Euboea and in Phokis, including those of Apollo at Abai, Apollo Seli naios at Histiaia, Apollo Daphneophoros and Athena at Eretria, Artemis Amarysia at Amarynthos and two sanctuaries to Artemis at Antikyra, and also a unique inscribed monument, crowned with a bust of Hadrian, for the people of Naryka. Just as Marchand's survey allows readers of A G to benefit from a wide number of projects conducted under the auspices of the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece, so the multi-authored chapter on the epigraphy of the northern Aegean is the fruit of a creative collaboration between the National Hellenic Research Foundation and the École française d'Athènes. It is a particular pleasure to be able to include in this year's A G the work of some of our French colleagues, who collaborate so closely on the archive mate rial for AGOnline. The publication of the corpus of 500 inscriptions from Aegean Thrace provides the focus of Maria-Gabriella Parissaki's survey of recent epigraphic research in the region. She reviews recent work on some well-known documents, as well as valuable comments on the population of the area as revealed in funerary monuments and linguistic forms. This study dovetails with Julien Fournier and Patrice Hamon's survey of epigraphy on Thasos during the last decade. In the case of an inscription from Abdera that matches a fragment copied on Thasos at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, we can see why such collaboration becomes more than the sum of the parts. The fragment commemorating a woman, Perigenis, has thus been reunited with that for her husband, Samos, honoured in the second fragment. The joint monument was probably erected early in the second century AD. Founder's and Hamon's contribution anticipates the publication of the new corpus of inscriptions of Thasos and offers a short introduction to the different topical groups of documents that will be published within it. The new corpus has involved a great deal of new work, as well as a review and rereading of known documents. Three hundred new rupestral inscriptions have been added to the total number of known masons' marks on the circuit walls of Thasos city, which now amounts to 549. One of the most important consequences of the work done in preparation for the new corpus has been a close architectural study of the 'Passage des théores', adjacent to the agora, and of associated civic documents. Monumental lists of Thasian magistrates began to be recorded in the Archaic period, but scholars have found it hard to sys tematize the multiple lists. We now learn that there were two principal lists of civic archons and theoroi, inscribed in the 360s BC, with two more lists compiled in the 320s BC, which received further additions in subsequent centuries. It appears that the Thasians had as many as 50 magistrates by the end of the fourth century BC. The documents that accumulated in and around the civic centre of Thasos and in the cemeteries in its immediate vicinity provide a huge resource about the island's social history, not just in Classical and Hellenistic times, but also in the Imperial age; these will provide scholars with research material for many years to come. The inscriptions from the northern Aegean region represent an illuminating linguistic as well as a social resource. From Thasos itself there are inscriptions in Parian and Ionian scripts, with onomastic variants that reflect the island's more particular Ionian preferences. From the mainland opposite Thasos comes a small group of inscriptions that seems to reflect adaptation into Greek of non-Greek, local (Thracian) dialects or language(s). These have been identified at Maroneia and at Zone (notably from the Sanctuary of Apollo) and may be connected to analogous material from Samothrace. The growing corpus of initiates into the cult of the Great Gods at Samothrace provides further contextual data for the coming together of groups and individuals who were ethnically or linguistically heterogeneous, but conjoined in cult aspira tions. Occasional, more distant visitors certainly did join the crowds of Macedonians, northern Aegean and Hellespontine Greeks and Thracians who were among the regular visitors to the sanctuary. We might Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 3</page><page sequence="4">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 include the theoroi from Stratonikeia and Sardis. Nevertheless, one of the hallmarks of Hellenistic and Roman times was the facility of long-distance travel. This explains the presence of one Apollonios of Babylon at Abdera (referred to by Parissaki) or a man from Arbela, in Syria, buried in the eastern cemetery of Chalcis, on Euboea, not far from someone from Zone, in Thrace (reported in Marchand's chapter). Samothrace also provides a link to our last, but by no means least, topic of AG 61, namely research on ancient sculpture. Maria-Gabriella Parissaki refers in her contribution to the restoration project associated with the statue of Nike from Samothrace in the Louvre Museum. Marianne Hamiaux, who has studied the statue base and the sculptor's signature that is sometimes associated with it, has denied any association between the statue, its base and the fragmentary signature (Hamiaux et al. 2015). The block that shows the surviving letters of a Rhodian artist's signature cannot belong to the monument (SEG XVI1015, 1016). As a result, the whole gamut of questions regarding authorship, patronage and historical context has been reopened. The Louvre project has resulted in a series of publications (referred to by Parissaki and Palagia), public events and online resources, illustrating the aims and the mechanics of the restoration (see, for example, http://www.louvre.fr/en/conservation-project-winged-victory-samothrace-and-monumental-stair case; http://musee.louvre.fr/oal/victoiredesamothrace/victoiredesamothrace_acc_en.html). The Nike of Samothrace provides an appropriate case study for considering the role of sculpture and of creative production in general in the Greek past. Much of what is discovered in excavations is highly fragmentary. Complete statues, where these have been recovered, are extremely rare, and most statues have long ago found their way into collections, whether private or public. Most often, these tantalizing survivals come with no ready associations, no labels, no useful contextual information. Much of what we have learned about sculptures has been the result of patient visual study, laboratory analysis and generic comparison with other works. The Nike was discovered by Charles Champoiseau in a remarkably well preserved condition, although headless and lacking arms. The wings were restored with plaster during the 19th-century restorations in the Louvre Museum. The recent restoration project has removed the plinth block below the statue, so that the figure now stands directly on the ship's prow. In her assessment of recent research on sculpture, Olga Palagia draws attention to the materials - the Lartian (Rhodian) marble of the base and the Parian marble - of the Nike of Samothrace. She prefers to see a Rhodian artist, or artists, behind this monument, although she, like many other scholars who have explored the possible historical associations of the dedication, allows for a range of possible historical contexts which this prominent and extraordinary monument was intended to commemorate (Palagia 2010). The difficulties of making any historical association stick convincingly has discouraged some scholars from even attempting to explore the contexts within which statues and artistic monuments were created. Yet, as Palagia shows, new discoveries are providing a broader and more coherent framework for such one-off creations. We may not be in a position to say precisely for whom the Nike was created or who paid for its production, but the scope and tastes displayed in contemporary sculpture within the Aegean region do offer much more than useful classificatory data, as she shows in the cases of the larger than life sized bronze horseman, retrieved from the sea near Kalymnos, and the trophy from the Athenian Agora, recently published by John Camp. Of special interest is a series of new sculptures from Macedonia, notably the extraordinary series of statue groups from outside a tomb monument at Pydna (Makrygialos). Catherine Morgan refers, in her View from Greece, to the life-sized statue of Silenus from excavations in the heart of Pella. These examples must surely give grounds for optimism about the potential for recovering con textual information that can also inform our understanding of how and why statues were important to their makers and audiences.1 1 Thus Caroline Vout, in a broad review of how we may view ancient sculpture: 'Look around in museums and we are confronted with a mass of material that is yet to be given the recognition it deserves, and which threatens to blow apart everything we think we see when we attempt to put a piece, any piece, back into its ancient context... there is just too much out there to gain more than a partial picture. To call excavation the art historian's enemy would be absurd. We must embrace the surplus of data it offers, and the inevitable loss of data, and do our best to work with both of them' (Vout 2012: 452). 4 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="5">Introduction &amp; overview Palagia has herself contributed to a reappraisal of Athenian sculpture, particularly in relation to the earliest examples of Attic marble statuary. Her review of exhibitions and catalogues reflects the vibrancy of current research on ancient art, and sculpture in particular, in bronze as well as marble. The re-emergence of the plastic arts as a topic of scholarly interest has been marked by the addition of two new chapters in Sue Alcock and Robin Osborne's survey of Classical archaeology (2012). The recent exhibition in the British Museum, Defining Beauty: The Body in Ancient Greek Art (Jenkins 2015), referred to by Palagia, has recontextualized ancient sculpture within the tradition of western plastic art, without losing the ancient roots to which individual pieces were connected. Palagia's reappraisal of the sculptured monuments of the Amphipolis tomb, referred to in some detail in AG 60, will surely arouse interest and controversy. In this case, the archaeological evidence pertaining to the chronology of the monument will prove at least as interesting as the current focus on the stylistic features of individual components. We await responses and further news with great interest. Finally, I would like to thank enthusiastically all this year's contributors, as well as those from the pre vious four editions of AG, and wish my successor as editor, Maria Stamatopoulou, every success with future editions.

It has certainly been a tumultuous year, and heartfelt thanks are due to col leagues, especially those in the Archaeological Service, who have gone the extra mile to deliver their own work and to help others in the face of mounting pressures. In 2014 alone, the Central Archaeological Council dealt with 1,477 cases in 42 sittings, and its 2015 target is set to exceed this. Yet as I take stock of what has been achieved in publication, fieldwork, study and public communication, I am struck by the wealth of new information available and in many forms. Individual finds, continuing research programmes and a number of landmark conferences and exhibitions have contributed to real and significant advances in knowledge. There is much to report, and even more to see on the ground for readers inspired (as we hope) to spend time in Greece. When Archaeology in Greece went to press last September, the Greek and international press was seized with Amphipolis fever. Twelve months on, populist reaction to the promise of a major Macedonian élite tomb has subsided. Debates about the inhabitants of the tomb, its date and significance will surely continue, but the weight of academic opinion is now swinging towards the view that at least a major remodelling (if not the initial construction) postdates the Roman conquest of Macedon (168 BC). Olga Palagia sets out below the sculptural case for this date, which of course precludes a connection with the Macedonian Temenid royal family. Excavation was halted for economic reasons early in 2015. Study of the human bones from the first phase of excavation indicates the burial of five individuals, but there are surely more to be found (not least given the lack of rich grave goods so far). Future work in the mound can now be guided by the results of a geophysical survey. Meanwhile, attention has turned to the conser vation and stabilization of the site (both the mound itself and conditions within it) - major and expensive work but essential not least to avoid unprotected exposure to a second winter. Study of the various cate gories of find continues, and we await with interest full details and publication of this material. Site conservation and display have also been a focus of activity in many other parts of Greece. Archae ology in Greece Online has for a number of years reported on the large programme of conservation and restoration at Nikopolis, which has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the major monuments of the Roman city. This year, work on the odeion has been completed, providing new information on many aspects of one of the best preserved monuments in the city, from the time of its construction under Augustus and its remod elling at the end of the second or early third century AD. With a seating capacity of ca. 1,000, the building was not especially large, but it was located right beside the agora, and substantial investment was made in its decoration (noting for example the polychrome marble facing of the orchestra and the rich marble decoration of the upper storey, including a geison with Corinthian capitals). A further long-running programme of conservation at the Monastery of Daphni, begun in the aftermath of the 1999 earthquake which caused serious damage to the structure and its mosaics, was completed in August 2015. Major public works (in many cases now resumed after delays imposed by the financial crisis) continue to bring important sites to light.

We have reported in previous years on the fruits of a series of rescue excavations conducted for the restoration of Lake Karla in Thessaly, which include a rich diversity of settlement remains dating from prehistoric to Hel lenistic times. At Tsingenina, finds include a group of seven Middle Helladic buildings (ID4013, ID5092): five of them have now been reburied, but the two largest (a house and a storage facility), together with a peribolos enclosing an area of ca. 280 m2, have been 2.

New directions in museology have drawn our attention in recent years. The new Acropolis Museum is one of the most striking (and popular) visitor attractions in Athens. In 2015 it celebrated its sixth anniver sary (and some eight million visitors) with a temporary exhibition entitled Samothrace. The Mysteries of the Great Gods and a day conference in June on recent archaeological research on Samothrace. The exhi bition includes finds from the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, the cemetery attached to the settlement and the Minoan settlement at Mikro Vouni, which were transferred from the Samothrace Museum while it is closed for major renovation. This is the first time that this material has left the island. Quite apart from the intrinsic interest of the exhibition, the decision to take advantage of a period of museum closure to bring to the capital important materials from a remote area is a welcome innovation which, one hopes, will serve as a model for the future. The success of the new museum is just one part of a larger plan for the museum complex. The old museum on the top of the Acropolis is itself of historical significance. First built in 1874 by the architect Panagis Kalkos (one of the first Greek architects to work in the modern state) and then progressively altered until it reached its current form in 1964, it is perhaps surprising to find that it has not been listed as a historical monument, although there is widespread recognition of its significance and goodwill to preserve it. It will soon gain a new lease of life as a museum focused on the history of conservation and restoration on the Acropolis, as a complement to the main museum. The storerooms still hold a quantity of large and immovable epigraphical and architectural finds; these will be visible to the public, who will also be able to visit conservation facilities and see marble workers in action in the workshops of the Acrop olis restoration team. The plan is exciting, and, especially for those of us who have been privileged to know members of the restoration team 'family' for many years, a fitting tribute to their extraordinary achievements. The third part of the new plan, approved by the Central Archaeological Council in 2014 but awaiting final funding, is the display in situ of finds from the Makryianni plot excavated in preparation for the con struction of the new museum. As is clear from our previous reports, both in print and online, the wealth of information spanning prehistory to early modernity (ca. 3,000 BC to AD 1200) in an area of some 4km2 affords a unique opportunity to gain a real sense of a city neighbourhood. The excavated area is already exposed to view, and the plan is now to display some 1,400 artefacts and architectural members in what will effectively become a new wing of the museum. Via pathways laid through the site and structured exhibits on key themes and on the activities practised in particular areas, the visitor will, in the words of museum Director Dimitris Pandermalis, experience a touch of the daily life of the city to contrast with the official Athens of the museum. Athens and Attica have been the subjects of a number of exhibitions and conferences this year, with Ottoman Athens a particular focus. Videocasts of a conference at the American School of Classical Studies on The Topography of Ottoman Athens: Archaeology and Travel, which accompanied an exhibition in the Gennadius Library, can be found in the online digital library of the ASCSA (http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.

The exhibition itself formed part of a wider co-initiative with the Benaki Museum and the Museum of the City of Athens to examine the city in the period 1458-1833. This coincides with a number of milestones in the his tories of venerable Athenian institutions. The 180th anniversary of the adoption of Athens as capital of the Greek state was celebrated in an exhibition in the Art Gallery of the City of Athens which in 2014 itself cel ebrated its centenary. Over 100 images of the city and its buildings by 87 Greek and foreign artists were shown in an initiative which is doubly welcome because it has breathed new life into the gallery's fine Neoclassical building in Plateia Koumoundourou 3.

The latest exhibition, offi cially opened in September 2015, again marks an anniversary. A Dream among Wonderful Ruins, a Walk in the Athens of the Travellers, 17lh-19th Century at the National Archaeological Museum runs through the lead up to the museum's 150th birthday on 3rd October 2016. Focused on the archaeological sites of Athens, it combines a range of art works and books from the collections of the Hellenic Parliament, the General Archive of the State and the Museum of the City of Athens with the National Museum's own holdings. These formal events have been accompanied by a diverse range of lectures and guided walks that have fostered a new awareness of the city's history. It is greatly to be hoped that plans to open the oldest standing house in Athens, the 16th-century mansion of the Benizelos-Palaiologos family, as a museum soon come to fruition. Indeed, 2014-2015 has seen much of interest for those concerned with the later Medieval and Early Modern material culture of Greek lands. Among a series of events to mark the 400th anniversary of the death of El Greco, I single out the exhibition Domenikos Theotokopoulos before El Greco at the Byzantine and Christian Museum, which focused on the social and cultural world of the Crete in which Theotokopou los grew up. Thematic displays featured an innovative combination of art works, manuscripts and textiles with archaeological materials from rescue excavations across Crete which richly illustrated the material culture of daily life. It is unfortunate that financial constraints prevented the publication of the catalogue before the exhibition closed in March 2015, but this will surely be an important work when it does appear. Turning to antiquity, here too Athens and Attica have featured prominently. In April 2015, a conference and exhibition at the Numismatic Museum {Mines, Metals and Money in Attica and the Ancient World) shed new light especially on Athenian coinage and ancient metallurgy. Papers ranged over matters of tech nology (from extraction to coining), the monitoring of quality and standards, minting and extraction activ ity at Laurion (the programme can be found at http://www.mq.edu.aU/research/centres_and_groups/acans/i nternational_conference_on_ metallurgy_mines_numismatics and archaeology/program/). A second major conference, organized by the Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs, the University of Athens, the Museum of Cycladic Art and American School of Classical Studies on Athens and Attica in Prehistory was a landmark in our understanding of Attica in its wider regional context, with numerous presentations of large bodies of data and syntheses often building on the results of rescue excavation. The proceedings will be published, but in the meantime videocasts of the sessions can be found in the ASCSA digital library (http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/digital-library/lecture-archive). In the same library I also draw attention to recordings of papers given at the September 2015 meeting ΟΞΥΔΕΡΚΕΙΝ at Korakou: A Centennial Celebration of C. W. Blegen s 1915-1916 Excavations. I have emphasized the way in which guided walks and other popular activities have fostered interest in the Ottoman city of Athens. In the same spirit, the 2015 Athens Festival included Katerina Evangelatos' excellent production of the Rhesos, attributed to Euripides, performed in the Lyceum of Aristotle.

The imaginative use of the Lyceum for one of the most talked-of perform ances of the past summer is thus most welcome. Other exhibitions and conferences have focused on specific categories of object (such as a workshop on Terracotta Sculpture: New Finds and New Studies at the British School at Athens, co-organized with the Aristotle University, Thessaloniki), on specific themes in ancient culture (as the highly successful exhibitions at the Museum of Cycladic Art, HYGEIA. Health, Illness, Treatment from Homer to Galen and BEYOND. Death and Afterlife in Ancient Greece) and on the art of particular places (the exhibition Rhodes: A Greek Island at the Gateway to the East, 15th-5'h Centuries BC, originally shown in the Musée du Louvre, transferred to Rhodes Museum in July 2015). In addition, a number of long-awaited exhibits were added to the permanent exhibitions of museums around the country. Thus the Fisherman Fresco went on display in the Museum of Prehistoric Thera last June and early next year we will finally see on display in the Archaeological Museum of Thera the monu mental (2.3m high) seventh-century marble kore from the cemetery of Sellada found some 15 years ago (Fig. 4). A kore of this monumental scale is rare: its exhibition was approved soon after its discovery, but having waited over a decade for funds to enable a large-scale redisplay of the museum galleries, the more practical decision was taken with the aid of the city council to renovate the one room needed for its display. Large projects may be hard to achieve in present circumstances, but smaller and highly effec- 4. rhera, Sellada: Archaic kore. © Ministry of Culture, tive practical steps like this can ensure that the most Education and Religious Affairs. important discoveries are made available. As I write, the British School's Fitch Laboratory and its counterpart NCSR Demokritos are preparing to host the 13th European Meeting on Ancient Ceramics, where we will welcome over 200 delegates from across the world to present science-based archaeological research into all aspects of ceramic technology. Not only is science-based research thriving in Greece, but the challenge of its public communication is firmly taken up. A rare exhibition to be focused on science in archaeology, Ancient DNA. A Window on the Past and the Future at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, will remain on show for over a year (into August 2016) and act as a framework for the presentation of new analytical data from Neolithic Macedonia. The exhibition, which also includes Neolithic artefacts from the same sites as the skeletal material presented, examines the nature of a-DNA, sampling and analytical techniques, and the contribu tion of palaeogenetics when combined with anthropology and archaeology. Much of my report this year has been taken up with discussion of conferences and exhibitions, reflecting a general trend towards evaluation, synthesis and public engagement. But new finds are also rich, and in some instances the cumulative results of ongoing projects are now striking. A notable case is the Myce Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 9 4.

Despite 2015 reports in the inter national press implying that this is a new discovery (with ensuing discussion in the blogosphere), the impressive results now available are the fruits of a series of annual campaigns directed since 2009 by Adamantia Vasilogamvrou for the Archaeological Society of Athens, reports of which have been posted on AGOnline (ID1494, ID2322, ID2547, ID3407, ID4428). The site is extensive, covering some 3.5ha, with remains of a cemetery and at least three buildings so far excavated. Cemetery evidence places its establishment at the transition from the Middle to Late Bronze Age; there was a major fire destruction in Late Helladic IIB-IIIA1, and the discovery of wallpaintings and Linear Β tablets confirms the palatial status of the complex by this time. As the 'Newsround' below shows, important new discoveries are not lacking. I have already noted the polis site of Alikyrna; other striking discoveries include the Final Neolithic double burial of an embracing man and women from Diros. With over 150 field investigations (excavations, surveys and geophysical surveys) taking place in 2015, new results now being reported will appear on AGOnline over the next months. 1 conclude with a brief taste of what is to come. At Didymoteicho (Plotinopolis), excavation of a Roman villa complex and a bath has been pursued by Matthaios Koutsoumanis since 2009 (ID4600). The latest reports concern the mosaics found in a bath complex of the second to sixth century AD (Fig. 7), which lies in a known area of rich buildings (a villa with mosaics was found just 20m away in the 1980s). 7.

As ever, I am grateful to the entire AGOnline team for their support: this year we have been joined at the BSA by Anthoulla Vassiliades as a project assistant. Particular thanks are due to Matthew Haysom (who, as BSA Knossos Curator, has been responsible for reporting on Crete), as he leaves the British School for a lectureship at the University of Newcastle. This is also my final edition of Archaeology in Greece as BSA Director. The past eight years have seen the creation of Archaeology in Greece Online in collaboration with the École française d'Athènes and the steady evolution of Archaeology in Greece to take advantage of the new opportunities thus created for more accessible synthesis and analy sis. We are now able not merely to report new discoveries, but to comment more thoughtfully upon them and to contribute to the current climate of synthesis and analysis. I thank all with whom I have worked for making these developments possible - especially Dominique Mulliez for initiating AGOnline, Zosia Archibald for responding so creatively in developing/!rchaeoIogy in Greece and Gina Coulthard for ensur ing that we reach print each year - and I wish my successor, John Bennet, all good fortune.

As last year, this section is not intended to be exhaustive, but is designed to draw attention to those discoveries which do not appear elsewhere within Archaeological Reports but which nevertheless deserve to be highlighted in a manner which complements those more specialized contributions within the current volume and that content available digitally through AGOnline/Chronique des fouilles en ligne (www.chronique.efa.gr). Again, the very varied nature of this material has meant that, for the most part, it has proved preferable to organize this section chronologically (Palaeolithic through to Early Modern), rather than thematically. Palaeolithic to Mesolithic The last decade has witnessed the emergence of the insular Palaeolithic as ajmajor research theme in Greek archaeology: the identification of Palaeolithic tools in the Plakias region of southern Crete (see Strasser et al. 2010; Runnels 2014), a sensational herald for similarly early discoveries in the Ionian and Cycladic archipelagos. Now, the identification of Pleistocene activity on the summit and slopes of the Stélida hill, Naxos, first proposed more than three decades ago (Séfériadès 1983) and again following recent rescue excavation (Legaki 2012), has been confirmed following geoarchaeological survey by the Stélida Naxos Archaeological Project (SNAP) (Canadian Institute in Greece/21st EPCA) (see Carter et. al. 2014). A major chert outcrop located on the northwest coast of the island, Stélida once occupied a position close to the centre of the pre-Last Glacial Maximum Cycladic landmass known as 'Cycladia'. Middle Palaeolithic lithics were recovered across the site during 2013, with the highest densities in the area of two small rockshelters, A and B, and close to the best-quality chert outcrops at the southern peak. Within this assemblage, Denticulate Mousterian and Levallois flakes and ^ 10- Sli[if^nNaf°sIJf,rc^aβο1ο&amp;αα1 blades (Fig. 10) offer the earliest evidence for a Neanderthal presence in the Cycladic archipelago and suggest initial occupation on Naxos perhaps as early as ca. 250 thousand years ago.

All are located in an area of the Pindus well-known for Middle Palaeolithic activity (ID359, ID817, ID2147; Efstratiou et al. 2014). The most significant of this group, at the summit of Mount Kirkuri (Fig. 12), yielded a total of 147 lithics dating between the Levallois Middle Palaeolithic and the Bronze Age. The Late Palaeolithic component from Kirkuri was composed entirely of non-local flint and offered close parallels to material from the Klithi rock Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 At Megalopolis, Eleni Panagopoulou and colleagues (2015) report the excavation between 2013 and 2014 of Marathousa 1, the first Middle Pleistocene site excavated on the mainland and the first Late Palaeolithic open-air site in Greece with both lithic and faunal remains to be subject to systematic excavation. Positioned on the shore of a palaeolake, the site likely represents the product of the seasonal exploitation of lakeside game. The well-preserved lithic assemblage appears to reflect a 'core-and-flake' technocomplex; retouched tools are rare and bifacials are lacking altogether.

As a result, those pre/early Mousterian (late Lower or early Middle Palaeolithic) bifacial lithics identified at Kokkinopilos now represent the earliest stratigraphically-defined and radiometrically-constrained archaeological material yet identified in Greece (Tourloukis et al. 2015: 364-67). Positioned on the shore of a palaeolake, the site of Marathousa 1 likely represents the product of the seasonal exploitation of lakeside game.

Newsround shelter. Non-retouched bladelets of similarly non-local flint are reported from two find-spots on the northern slope of Mount Bogdhanis to the east. A truncated backed bladelet recovered from the eastern slope of Mount Vasilitsa has parallels at Late Palaeolithic Kastritsa, while a non-local black-flint microbladelet-backed point from a small glacial basin to the north of Samarina is paralleled in Early Mesolithic Unit IV at Boïla (see recently, Galanidou 2011: 226-27). On Kythera, a cycle of site revisits designed to test the integrity of, and where necessary clarify, data collected during the Kythera Island Project (KIP) has resulted in the identification of a previously unrecognized Mesolithic lithic component within the survey area (ID4888). Particularly visible on the stable plateaux in the northwest, these scatters appear to be largely consistent with the Mesolithic exploitation of small game and migratory bird populations. The initial occupation of the island had previously been identified with a modest Middle to Late Neolithic lithic assemblage (Broodbank and Kiriatzi 2007: 260). Neolithic to Bronze Age The publication of analyses undertaken on the Final Mesolithic to Initial Neolithic faunal sequence at Franchthi Cave (Munro and Stiner 2015) offers an important zooarchaeological perspective on the Mesolithic to Neolithic transition in the southern Argolid. As previously reported (AR 59 [2012-2013] 25), the site witnesses a near-wholesale replacement of red deer (Cervus elaphus) with caprines (sheep outnumbering goats) across the Final Mesolithic to Initial Neolithic transition (Munro and Stiner 2015: 597), as well as a rapid decline in the exploitation of small game and marine resources. A typical meat-focused production model is indicated by an almost 90% Initial Neolithic caprine mortality rate prior to 48 months of age, with a particularly high mortality rate (70%) between six and 12 months. The exceptionally small body size of the sheep at Franchthi suggests a managed population already subject to intensive selection and is most closely paralleled by roughly contemporary populations at Ulucak and Ilipinar in western Anatolia (Munro and Stiner 2015: 601). On the Mani peninsula, C14 dating carried out on charcoal and human bone from Alepotrypa has clarified a series of distinct occupation phases between the Early and Final Neolithic (ca.

This arrangement was not repeated with the second male/female pair who were, instead, interred in an extremely tightly contracted position. Alongside these adult double burials, excavation revealed an articulated Final Neolithic foetal burial and the double child enchytrismos reported previously (AR 59 [2012-2013] 25). At the settlement, a structure containing a stone 'thermal feature' and a monumental stone terrace wall Education and Religious Affairs. (Parkinson et al. 2015) represent important additions to the meagre Final Neolithic Peloponnesian architectural record. Long after its Final Neolithic abandonment, Xagounaki was selected as the site of a unique Mycenaean ossuary. Approximately 4m in diameter and built of unworked cobbles, the structure yielded the disarticulated remains of dozens of individuals on a floor of river-rolled pebbles (Fig. 14). Fine Late Helladic III ceramics, polished stone beads, an ivory pin and a bronze dagger are reported among the grave goods. The general absence of evidence for Mycenaean activity in the area suggests that the dead, or parts thereof, may have been transported some significant distance for burial. 15. Lambogiannas: Early Helladic Archaeology in Greece. Building on preliminary work undertaken during 2012 (AR 59 [2012-2013] 27), underwater survey in the Bay of Koilada as wall l withcurvilinear foundation. part of the Terra Submersa Expedition (EMA/Swiss School of © Ministiy of Culture, Education and Archaeology in Greece/Geneva) has identified a substantial Religious Affairs and Swiss School of Early Helladic settlement off the Lambogiannas coast (ID5045), similar in size and character to the Early Helladic settlement previously identified ca. 2-3km north at Salandi Bay (ID117). Paved streets and numerous rectilinear, curvilinear and apsidal stone structures extend over an area of ca. 2ha (Beck 2015: 43), while a probable fortification wall, ca. 2m wide, preserves at least three large (ca. 18m χ 10m) horseshoe-shaped foundations along its length (Fig. 15). Early Helladic II ceramics, stone tools and obsidian blades are also reported on the seabed. The discoveries at Lambogiannas are paralleled by preliminary publication of the Early Helladic fortified site at Kastelli Keratitsas (MacVeagh Thorne et al. 2013). Situated on the small limestone acropolis of Kastraki, overlooking the pass through the Marioremma Gorge, the ca. 3m-wide double-faced rubble-fill wall of the so-called Upper Enclosure at Kastelli survives in places to a height of ca. 2m and may originally have been entirely stone-built and considerably higher. At least three probable curvilinear bastions are noted along its length and a well-preserved gate, ca. 3m wide, survives at the northwest (Fig. 16). The wall of the Lower Enclosure is more fragmentary, although it appears to have been both narrower (ca. 2-2.5m) Institute in Athens. 16 | Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 16.

A wall of at least 60m connects the northwestern gateway of the Upper Enclosure with a lower plateau preserving possible house walls and a rock-cut well or cistern (MacVeagh Thorne et al. 2013: 120); another, traced over at least 140m along the cliff beyond the Lower Enclosure, was apparently designed to defend the principal access route to the site. On Astypalaia, work continues within the fortified Early Cycladic settlement at Elleniko (Vathy) (ID4703). The micro excavation of an Early Cycladic I vessel identified in 2012 (ID3099) yielded the remains of a perinatal infant. The fill of the vessel preserved the impression of a funerary textile in which the infant had been buried: an incredibly rare example of © ASA and University ofloannina. a practice which must have been common during the Early Bronze Age (Fig. 17). The identification of a further Early Cycladic I enchytrismos during cleaning below the prehistoric retaining wall at the north of the peninsula suggests that this area served as a burial area for the young. The huge significance of Elleniko derives from the identification of a substantial number of Early Cycladic 'pecked' carvings which serve to align Elleniko with the Final Neolithic to Early Cycladic petroglyphic tradition known from Korphi t'Aroniou (Naxos), Strophilas and Plaka (Andros; AR 60 [2013-2014] 15), Agios Athanaiou (Irakleia) and Keros (ID4284). Spiral, wheel, arrow, chequerboard, quadruped and dagger motifs have all been identified; ship petroglyphs are recorded at the gateways to the site, some with the familiar 'fish' motif at their prow (Fig. 18). Included among historic graffiti are two examples of an erotic character. The first of these, accompanied by two phalli, records the name ΔΙΩΝ and dates to the late fifth or early fourth century BC. The second, located on the upper plateau of the peninsula, is a boustrophedon text, which can probably be dated to the early sixth century BC. It extends across two lines and refers to the relationship of two men: ΝΙΚΑΣΙΤΙΜΟΣ/ΟΙΦΕ ΤΙΜΙΩΝΑ (Fig. 19). Excavation by the National and Kapodostrian University of Athens has further exposed the important Middle Helladic settlement at Plasi-Marathon (ID2229; http://www.archaeology.wiki/blog/2015/05/27/new-finds-plasi marathon-attica/). The substantial double-faced rubble-fill Middle Helladic fortification has been cleaned and clarified, while a large megaron-plan building and a late Middle Helladic kiln are also reported. Occupation continued into the Late Helladic and Early Iron Age, while a well-built temenos wall of polygonal masonry marks the limits of a sanctuary which occupied the site during the Archaic period.

The Late Helladic III tomb is unlooted and survives to a maximum height of ca. 3m. In addition to commingled skeletal remains, the burial chamber {ca. 5.9m in diameter) yielded 44 decorated vessels, two bronze vessels, rings of bronze and gold (one with an engraved bezel), beads of bronze and semi-precious stone, two bronze daggers, a number of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines, and a substantial group of decorated seals.

Following the long-awaited publication of historic excavations in the Mycenaean cemetery at Brauron (Papadopoulos and Kontorli-Papadopoulou 2014), the funerary landscape of Mycenaean Attica is further augmented by rescue excavations which have extended the limits of the cemetery at Glyka Nera (ID4870, ID2258). Two Late Helladic IIIA2-B chamber tombs (A and B) are reported from the junction of Mesologiou and Nikopoleos Streets, and on the adjacent Aiolou Street. Skeletal remains and grave goods were recovered from two pits in the dromos of Tomb A and from a sealed niche in its northern wall. Further remains piled up at the interior of the burial chamber were accompanied by a group of 22, mostly closed, vessels. Two burial pits were identified in the west of the chamber of which the first, Pit 1, contained the remains of at least 11 individuals, a kyathos, ajar, an amygdaloidal agate bead, a bronze knife, a steatite spindle-whorl and fragments of lead wire. Superimposed layers of bones and ceramics are reported from Pit 2. The slightly smaller Tomb Β yielded bone piles AmPhissa.· Mycenaean tholos^ along the chamber walls, as well as two contracted burials at the centre. Offerings included 13 vessels, four steatite spindle whorls, fragments of wire and a sealstone. A further LHIIIB-IIIC1 chamber tomb is reported from the adjacent Byzantiou Street (ID4867). Rock-cut pilasters flanked the stomion, while the chamber yielded skeletal remains and a modest assemblage including two stirrup jars and a painted skyphos. Palaeopathological analysis of the wider burial population at Glyka Nera has yielded important data on the diet and lifestyle of the local Mycenaean population (see Papathanasiou et al. 2015). Particularly significant is the identification of two probable examples of trephination (both on males), one of which may have been undertaken in an attempt to treat a cyst on the nuchal crest. A significant northwest extension to the Mycenaean cemetery at Varkiza-Vari is reported from rescue excavation on the Tsimi plot at Thasou and and Agoriani Streets (ID4979).

LHIIIA1-IIIB1 remains are also reported from three other plots on Thasou Street (ID232). The Greek press reports that construction of the national road at Rema Xydias, west of Mount Olympus in the area of Platamonas (Pieria), has exposed the remains of a Late Helladic settlement and cemetery (http://www.archaeology.wik i/blog/2014/12/16/cemetery-settlement-apsidal-buildings/). Two apsidal buildings represent the first examples of the type to be identified in this region. The first, ca.lOm in length, appears to have received a rectangular two-room extension along its eastern flank and preserved the remains of clay fixtures in the interior, alongside a large volume of handmade and wheel-thrown Mycenaean-style pottery (Fig. 21). Two monumental walls were identified immediately south of these two structures, the function of which remains unclear. In total, 19 cists were also identified; some held multiple adult burials, others were small and most likely held children. Grave goods included handmade and wheelmade Mycenaean-style vessels, bronze rings, bone beads, spindle-whorls, loomweights and a seal stone. Meanwhile, a synergasia between the ASCSA, the University of Cincinnati and the 38th EPCA at Pylos (ID4454) in advance of the construction of a new roof above the Palace of Nestor, has seen excavation through the anthropogenic stratigraphy of the site down to sterile soil in the area of the Wine Magazine (Rooms 104 and 105) and in Court 88. A total of 15 trenches were inserted in those areas where pylon supports were to be anchored, revealing cultural deposits dated between the late Middle Helladic and Late Helladic IIIB. Early Iron Age, Archaic and Classical Rescue excavation at Psomi (ID4748) has revealed the earliest organized necropolis yet identified in the area of modern Chios. In use between the seventh and sixth century BC, the majority of graves identified are supine pit burials, although adult burials in pithoi and child enchytrismoi are also attested. A single instance of burial in a stone sarcophagus and another in a terracotta sarcophagus of Klazomenean type represent rare variations at the site. Most importantly, Psomi has yielded the Ministry of Culture, Education and first example of an Archaic horse burial to be excavated in the Religious Affairs. northeastern Aegean (Fig. 22).

Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 On Despotiko (ID4745), excavation by the 21st EPCA in the Archaic Sanctuary of Apollo has exposed a large Classical room complex in the area of the gateway through the temenos, while continued work in Archaic Building Delta has revealed a deposit of ninth-century BC pottery and burnt and unburnt horse, pig and caprid bones, associated with the inception of cult activity at the site. Trenches opened to the west of Building Delta yielded numerous architectural terracottas (Fig. 23), zoomorphic vessels, bronze votives and painted Parian pottery. Several vessels bearing inscribed dedications to Apollo are also noted. Augmenting the already substantial sculptural assemblage from the site are a fragment of foot and base-block belonging to an Archaic kouros (Fig. 24) and a colossal finger of ca. 490-480 BC, most likely deriving from the sanctuary's cult statue. In Laconia, excavation in the Sanctuary of Apollo Amyklaios on Agia Kyriaki has revealed further remains of the Early to Middle Helladic settlement and the Late Geometric peribolos which marks the earliest monumental phase of the sanctuary (Fig. 25; http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=62253). The identification of the foundation cut for the so-called Throne of Apollo provides important new data on its dimensions, while traces of the monumental propylon of the sanctuary have also been uncovered at the northwest. The Archaic peribolos has been exposed across the western slope over a distance of ca. 50m and, while its course at the south remains unclear, this negates earlier suggestions of a horseshoe-form wall and free access to the sanctuary at the west.

Pheneos: Archaic to Classical cult Newsround A group of four cists and five pits is reported from rescue excavations conducted by the 16th EPCA at 21 Alex. Papagou Street, Thessaloniki (ID495). Among the former, a probable male burial was accompanied by a local seventh-century BC red-slipped bowl, while a second burial was interred with a prochous and phiale at the feet and a piece of gold leaf over the mouth. The pits contained large volumes of plain and painted local, Attic, Euboean and Corinthian sherds, representing standard Early Iron Age and Archaic shapes. At 9 Alex. Papagou Street, a group of 13 cist graves yielded a further assemblage of plain and painted Early Iron Age to Archaic pottery, as well as a large volume of shell, including murex. Both sites lie adjacent to the major Early Iron Age to Classical site of Karabournaki. At ancient Pheneos, the fourth season of a planned five-year research programme under the Austrian Archaeological Institute at Athens and the 37th EPCA has identified the first evidence of Neolithic settlement on the hill, as well as providing additional detail on the ancient fortification and the Late Antique occupation (ID4510, ID5051).

A Education and Religious Affairs and small gateway has been identified at the eastern edge of the Austrian Archaeological institute. northern slope; a second may have existed at the west, although the wall here is extremely fragmentary. The fortification was augmented with a series of five towers (Π1-5), of which four were semicircular {ca. 5.5m in diameter) and the fifth, slightly larger (ca. 6m in diameter), was a three-quarter-circle in plan. A bronze coin of Sikyon identified in 2012 provides a terminus post quem of 345 BC for construction, with a likely date in the later fourth century BC (Lehner and Spyranti 2014: 3—4). Some 100m east of the chapel of Agios Konstantinos, excavation yielded an Archaic to Classical cult building. With internal dimensions of ca. 15.5m χ 3.7m, the structure is oriented northwest-southeast on an artificial terrace on the eastern slope of the acropolis. Its later, Classical, phase incorporates a number of 'temple-like' fixtures, including a square eschara of slate and tile with a border of L-shaped bricks and, ca. 8m northwest on the same alignment, a monolithic rectangular stone stele which presumably served as the base for a cult statue (Fig. 26).

This material can be dated between the early and late fifth century BC. A fragment of Late Classical skyphos evidences a continuation of deposition, albeit at a reduced scale, into the fourth century BC, although an absence of later material indicates a cessation of cult activity within the sanctuary, perhaps prompted by the foundation of the city wall in proximity An initial Archaic phase of the sanctuary is suggested by material recovered below the votive pits, including a phiale mesomphalos, though an Archaic construction date for the cult building remains uncertain. The excavation of a Late Archaic oven in Area H and a deposit of Protocorinthian pottery in Area L nevertheless provide the first definitive evidence of Archaic settlement on the northern slope (Lehner and Spyranti 2014: 8). Finally, excavation to the east of the Asklepieion, in an area of the plain investigated during the 1960s by the Nauplion Ephoreia, exposed a series of three spolia piers (Fig. 27), perhaps belonging to a Late Antique double-door arrangement or, more likely, forming part of a stoa.

There is, as yet, no trace of Roman occupation on the hill itself. Hellenistic to Roman Construction of the Ionia Odos on the hill of Chilia Spitia, between Pleuron and Kalydon at Mesolongi, has revealed extensive remains (ca. 2ha) belonging to the Late Classical to Hellenistic city of Alikyrna (ID5049; Vikatou 2014). A series of four streets has been exposed, ca. 4.5m wide, running north south at a distance of ca. 32m, as well as a fifth which, oriented east-west and slightly wider at ca. 5.2m, most likely represents the city's main artery. The urban fabric of the ancient city is represented by ten room complexes, of which the majority appear to have served as warehouses, workshops and shops (Fig. 28). To the west, a major votive deposit associated with a previously unknown sanctuary was revealed on the eastern bank of the Agios Simeon stream. Measuring ca. 6m χ 7m, and demarcated at one side by two parallel walls, the deposit yielded over 15,000 sherds and figurine fragments of which the © Ministry of Culture, Education and majority are Hellenistic in date (Fig. 29).

Zoomorphic forms include pig, ram, horse, bovid, dove and cockerel, while satyrs and several characters from New Comedy are depicted among a group of terracotta masks. The focus of cult at the Agios Simeon site remains unclear, although Artemis, Dionysus and Aphrodite all represent likely candidates. A three-headed Cerberus suggests the worship of Demeter and Kore, as does a sherd with plastic decoration, perhaps deriving from a kotiliskos associated with the adoration of the Eleusinian Mysteries (Mitsopoulou 2010: 30. Rigaiika: Classical to Hellenistic 86, figs 7-9). The sanctuary itself may be identified in a complex of at least three buildings located ca. 50m above the stream bank. Evidence for contemporary settlement below Chilia Spitia is provided by a Hellenistic potter's kiln at Thymorachi (ID2362) and by possible house remains to the south of the hill at Zesti. Traces of a substantial isodomic water channel identify a probable public installation on the western slope, and a substantial peribolos has also been identified. A group of later fourth-century BC tombs is known on the southern slope (ADelt 26 [1972] 325-26) and a Macedonian tomb has previously been reported on the Glezaki plot {ADelt 44 [1989] Bl: 139). A short distance to the east, rescue excavation by the 36th EPCA at Rigaiika (ID2397; Vikatou 2014) has revealed the largest organized Classical to Hellenistic necropolis known in Aetolia Akarnania. A total of 323 graves flank the ancient road between Alikyrna and Kalydon (Fig. 30). The majority are pit and cist graves, although two Macedonian tombs are also noted, of which one was demarcated by a peribolos. Single adult inhumations predominate, although there are instances of infant and child burials.

To the southeast of the tomb, excavation revealed a possible stone altar (ca. 3.48m χ 2.58m), beyond which lay a cist tomb, preserving stucco in the interior and yielding offerings of the late third to early second century BC. Excavation to the northwest of the Altis at Olympia (ID5047) (DAI/7th EPCA) has exposed the Hellenistic gymnasium in its entirety and its eastern perimeter wall over a distance of 186m (Fig. 33). The eastern stoa has also been traced for a total length of 70m, exposing in situ column sections and a drainage channel; no trace has been found of the western stoa, which has, in all likelihood, been washed away by the Kladeos. Two kilns, a well, a section of terracotta paved floor and several Roman to Late Roman walls attest to later activity in the same area. Noteworthy among the finds from this work are 350 bronze coins and a Roman bronze of a male deity. Also worthy of note are the recently published analyses of two distinct components of the Olympian ceramic repertoire.

Peloponnesian practices; the second (Mommsen et al. 2015) presents the results of Neutron Activation Analysis undertaken on red-figure pottery from the site, which demonstrates a distinct absence of southern Italian imports. Even those vessels made with ostensible Italian stylistic or iconographie influence are confirmed as local (northwestern Peloponnesian) products, as is a single lekythos which appears to be of the Agrinion Group. A small proportion are genuine Attic imports (Mommsen et al. 2015: 8). In the waters off northeastern Delos, subsurface survey has identified the remains of the ancient city's Stadion District, one of the few coastal areas undamaged by modern marine engineering and construction (http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj _id=59132). At a distance of ca. 30m from the current shoreline, excavation revealed a partially-preserved complex 34.

A second complex, comprising at least five rooms and flanked by two streets, was identified ca. 10m from the current shoreline. This building yielded a further group of 15 storage vessels embedded within a beachrock formation, as well as nine column fragments, likely deriving from the building's colonnade. Several large stone plinths identified in proximity probably represent the ancient breakwater, and it seems likely that a second commercial harbour operated in this area during the Late Hellenistic period, complementing activity in the main port (see also Zarmakoupi, this volume). 24 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 33.

The upper portion of each of these rings bore the inscription ΕΛΘΕ MOI Ω ΠΑΙΑΝ ΦΕΡΩΝ TO ΜΑΝΤΕΙΟΝ AAH0EC: an invocation to Apollo Paean to offer predictions of the future to the faithful, apparently as part of a hydromantic ritual. With more than 20 similar inscriptions recovered already this year, this discovery confirms the identification of the sanctuary as the seat of the Athenian oracle to Apollo. Late Antique to Early Modern Elsewhere at Athens, work associated with the conservation and consolidation of the Horologeion of Andronikos Kyrristos, the so-called 'Tower of the Winds', in the Roman agora has identified the remains of Byzantine wall-painting previously disguised beneath Late Ottoman plasterwork (Fig. 35; http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=62293). Neither the exact theme nor the date of the painting is currently clear, though it is probably to be associated with the Early Byzantine conversion of the Horologeion, evidenced by the incision of crosses across the structure and the presence of Christian burials beyond the northeastern entrance. An extremely large Late Roman structure is reported from work on the Threpsiades plot on the modern Isthmus-Epidauros road at Kenchreai (ID4880). Measuring ca. 41m north-south and at least ca. 26m east-west, its ground floor comprised a minimum of eight large rectangular rooms arranged around a peristyle court, while a large stairway provided access to rooms at first floor level (Fig. 36). At least two Roman construction phases are discernible, intermittently incorporating earlier spolia. Included among a very substantial sixth-century AD ceramic assemblage (ca. 50,000-100,000 sherds) are Late Roman Amphorae Types 1-5, African and Phocaean Red-Slip vessels, late African and Corinthian lamps, and numerous stemmed goblets. Various glass vessels and metal objects are also reported. The presence of so many amphorae, alongside numerous stoppers and funnels (Fig. 37), suggests the large scale movement of commodities through the building perhaps as late as the seventh century AD.

A deep pit excavated to the north of the temple yielded a fragment of a probable honorific inscription of the third century BC and, at a deeper level, an almost intact 12th- to 13th-century AD Gunsenin Type 3 amphora, due to be sampled for organic residue. Two ovoid rock-cut graves, each containing between 13 and 15 articulated burials, were identified immediately east of the temple platform in the area of the Byzantine cemetery (ID2683, Education and Religious Affairs. ID3063, ID4215). Together, these graves yielded a total of seven intact vessels and over 50 coins. Parallels in disposition, preservation and offerings suggest that these burials were interred over a relatively short period, with the possibility that the dead were the victims of a plague outbreak. A well-built circular wall (ca. 2m in diameter) of uncertain function was among further Byzantine remains exposed on the northern side of the hill, as was an Early Byzantine grave containing a mass of commingled skeletal remains and a group of 23 intact vessels.

In an adjacent room, imported finewares, glass vessels and coins were recovered, as well as a stamp with the inscription ΕΥΛΟΓΙΑ ΚΥΡΙΟΥ ΕΦΉΜΑΣ ΑΜΗΝ: most likely used for consecrated bread following the liturgy on major feast days. In Arcadia, an early seventh-century AD cemetery of 51 Slavic cremation pyres exposed during construction of the national road in the area of Asea (ID4499) offers an important analogue to the identification at Makri (ID4511), a short distance to the southwest, of a cemetery of 66 cremation pyres and ten graves of the eighth and ninth centuries AD (Fig. 41). Offerings at Makri were modest, consisting largely of handmade vessels and polychrome glass beads, and those from Asea have yet to be reported. Neverthless, the cemetery at Asea and the co-existence of traditional Slavic cremation burials and Christian inhumations at Makri provide important evidence for the migration of Early Slavic groups into the Peloponnese and for the chronology of their subsequent Christianization. 1cm 42.

Regional histories Dimitris Nakassis and colleagues (2015) report on the first of three planned seasons of surface survey in the northwest Argive plain as part of the Western Argolid Research Project (WARP) under the auspices of the Canadian Institute in Greece. The survey area (30km2) is focused on the upper valleys of the Inachos river to the northwest of Argos, subsuming the Classical polis of Orneai on the hill of Palaiokastraki (Fig. 43) and the probable area of the perioikic settlement of Lyrkeia, as well as several major routeways which link the plain with Arcadia and Corinthia, not least the ancient Klimax cart road connecting Argos and Mantineia. The first season of survey covered a total area of 5.5km2 around Palaiokastraki, identifying seven major sites and numerous surface scatters ranging in date between the Early Helladic and the Ottoman to Venetian period (Nakassis et al. 2015). Preliminary analysis suggests two major shifts in the settlement history of this area. The first is represented by a significant increase in activity during the Classical and Hellenistic periods, when low, defensible hills provided the focus of settlement (much as in earlier periods); the second occured during the Roman period, when settlement activity nucleated along the north side of the valley, ca. 500m from the Inachos river. To the northwest, bordered by the Kithairon-Pastra and Makron ranges at the Attic-Boeotian border, the small upland Mazi plain has played host to the inaugural season of the Mazi Archaeological Project (MAP) (ID4875).

Early Iron Age occupation on the plain is suggested by a handful of possible Late Geometric sherds, while the concentration of Archaic material in the area of Oinoe may indicate an Archaic foundation for the site (see also Ober 1987: 211-12). Some ca. 800m to the south, a later fifth-century BC site was identified at the Stanes Pepas plot, apparently abandoned early in the Hellenistic period and reoccupied during the Roman and Byzantine periods. A second settlement located close to the Mazi Tower yielded very high artefact densities over an area of ca. lha. Diagnostic sherds from cooking and storage vessels suggest occupation between the late fourth and second centuries BC, and again during the Roman and Byzantine periods. Particularly significant is the discovery of part of the ancient Eleusis-Oinoe road at the edge of the Kouloumbi plain. A series of six switchbacks aided descent into the eastern valley and cart ruts are visible at several points. The Classical to Hellenistic cist burial of a child was identified close to the point at which the road enters the plain. Survey at the site of the Velatouri Tower, which monitored the ancient road (Ober 1987: 157-58), yielded pottery indicative of a fourth-century BC construction date. A programme of architectural and photogrammetric recording was mounted across the upper and lower towns of ancient Oinoe itself (Fig. 45). Numerous buildings, walls and streets recorded within the area of the rectilinear fortification {ca. 150m x 136m) were variously ascribed to major building phases during the Late Classical, Early Hellenistic and Byzantine periods.

Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 town was delimited by a Byzantine fortification, perhaps reusing Classical walls, which enclosed an area of ca. 3.9ha. High densities of ceramics, glazed tile, amphorae and beehive fragments indicate intensive occupation within this area throughout the Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods. A total of 55ha across ancient and 'Macedonian' Methone were subject to archaeological survey under the aegis of the Ancient Methone Archaeological Project (seeAR 58 [2011-2012] 99 100; Myles Chykerda and Kontonicolas 2014). A small group of Late to Final Neolithic sherds from Survey Unit (SU) 090 represents the earliest surface material from Methone, while a large volume of Early to Middle Bronze Age pottery was identified immediately north of the East Hill excavation area (SU047). A high density of Roman material in the area of Macedonian Methone (SU077, SU078 and SU091) suggests that occupation here was relatively long-lived; significant volumes of roof tiles and a plaster-covered architectural block hint at the existence of one or more large buildings in the area. Marine archaeology Archaeological survey undertaken by the EMA during 2009 off the Laconian coast in the area of Koulenti has yielded the remains of a Minoan shipwreck; the first ever identified beyond the Cretan coast and currently paralleled only by the example found off Pseira (Hadjidaki and Betancourt 2005-2006). Much of the ship's Middle Minoan III to Late Minoan I cargo has been looted, although several jugs with cut-away spouts and a pair of amphorae were recovered (Spondylis 2012). Renewed excavation at the site of the Antikythera wreck (EMA/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) has traced elements of the ship and its cargo over an area of 300m2 and permitted the creation of a high-resolution photo-mosaic of the site. Several lead anchors, each more than lm in length, have been recovered, as well as a bronze rigging ring, structural planks and a section of the lead hull sheath, isotopic analysis of which may allow identification of the ship's home port. Other finds include a fragment of bronze kline leg, a near-intact lagynos and, most significantly, a ca. 2.1m section of a heavy bronze spear belonging to a colossal statue (Fig. 46) (http: //www.yppo.gr/2/g22.j sp?obj _id=58772; http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/antikythera-finds).

Meanwhile, continued work at the Mentor wreck site (ID4513, ID2904; http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=61814) has revealed additional evidence of the ship's antiquarian cargo. Alongside further modern personal effects, including an intact hourglass, dishes and utensils, a bone comb, a bone chess pawn and a glass stamp bearing the letter 'B', excavation revealed three Rhodian amphora handles (two stamped) of the third century BC and a small intact stone vessel. In the Sporades, further details have emerged concerning the EMA excavation of an early fourth-century BC mercantile wreck off the islet of Skantzoura (ID4730). Lying at a depth of ca. 32-38m, the wreck and its cargo cover an area of ca. 700m2. Although subject to multiple episodes of looting, the wreck yielded a substantial ceramic assemblage including ca. 250 Thasian amphorae, ca. 70 Solocha I-type (Peparethian) amphorae and ca. 40 Mendean amphorae, as well as fine Attic skyphoi and kantharoi. This announcement came as the Greek government approved plans to open the wreck of the well known late fifth-century BC merchant ship at nearby Peristera to diving tourism (see Hadjidaki 1996).

Overlying this area are the poorly preserved walls of two successive, Hellenistic and Roman, buildings. The second building produced architectural and stratigraphical evidence for LMII and LMIIIA2-B occupation (Fig. 49). One area (112) was modified into a staircase which yielded unburnt LMII pottery.

The rest of AMI is less well explored, although an in situ deposit in room 6 consisted of a large pithos with, in and around it, stone tools, a quern, loomweights, strainers, a fire box, an offering table and pot stands (Fig. 51). Sound ings beneath these levels revealed inter alia a well-made plastered and paved floor sloping down towards a drain. Material overlying it, accumulated """ 'landscape at Palaikastro. during a phase of abandonment, indicates that the building was reused only late in the Late Minoan period. Beyond the northern wall of this room was a grinding installation comprising a large saddle quern, a grind-stone and ajar built into the floor to catch the ground material (Fig. 52). An associated possible foundation deposit consisted of a juglet pierced after firing (likely using the bronze nail found with it). Excavation beneath it produced charcoal and sherds of a baking plate, while a heavy, utilitarian bronze double axe under the partition wall may be a further foundation deposit. LMIII reoccupation is attested in most areas, including the external spaces around the Neopalatial building, but is frequently ephemeral. Walls may have been poorly constructed, reusing older collapsed walls as foundations, but frequently we find simple reuse of a ruined structure without 53.

Among finds from this year's excavation, the mollusc remains are of particular interest. Two concen trations of crushed murex, Hexaplex trunculus (probably used shells in perishable containers), were found among Late Minoan III refuse in Building AMI. This is one the few large-scale domestic deposits of prob able waste from purple-dye production in the Aegean (noting also the possibility that murex was con sumed). An experiment in the production of purple dye was conducted using fresh purple shells collected from Palaikastro and Siteia, which were crushed to extract the molluscs using stone tools then kept for micro-wear analysis. Linen, wool and silk were used in the experiment, and two dye recipes devised (the liquid produced was saved for chemical analysis). Ensuing observations, when combined with records of shell fragments and diagnostic features in the archaeological contexts, will offer insight into the method and scale of purple-dye production on site. At Lefkandi too, work directed by Irene Lemos (Oxford) has focused on the coastline and marine fauna. In collaboration with the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece, cores were drilled at Lefkandi, Eretria and Aliveri to investigate the evolution of the central and southwestern Euboean coastline. The presence of marine incursions and macro fauna in cores from the putative site of the eastern harbour of Xeropolis confirm its identification. Lefkandi has produced one of the largest collections of marine faunal remains in the Greek Early Iron Age: study by Tatiana Theodoropoulou reveals intensive and coherent exploitation of marine habitats over time. Exploitation of mixed substrates (gravel, sand and mud) expanded from the shore to the deeper waters of the Euboean gulf, with collecting methods ranging from simple hand-collection or the use of knives to diving or trawling. Murex shells (usually crushed) are found in almost every excavation context. Hexaplex trunculus was probably consumed, with shell waste thrown into the hearth either as fuel or for disposal. However the hypothesis of purple-dye extraction at a house hold or artisanal level will be further investigated. The two other common shell types are oysters and fan shells: the latter strengthens the possibility of fine textile manufacture since it offers both an impressive nacreous shell and the fine filament commonly called 'sea-silk'. A wide range of other resources were occasionally exploited, including molluscs collected dead on the beach and used for their shell (thorny oysters used as scoops, and dove shells, cones and horn shells as ornaments). Fish were consumed at Lefkandi on a more limited scale. These include near-shore species such as the gilthead seabream, the European sea bass and the grey mullet, and sharks and rays - the last perhaps entailing memorable fishing trips, noting an amulet made of a pierced ray vertebra. Among the projects advanced at Lefkandi this year, one programme of ceramic analysis was completed and another begun. The most extensive archaeometric investigation of Euboean and Euboean-related pottery to date (Neutron Activation Analysis of samples from the main sites on Euboea as well as Euboean exports from Italy to Ionia) was published as the proceedings of a round table organized with the Austrian Institute of Archaeology at Athens (Kerschner and Lemos 2014). The new project is a programme of pet rographical and chemical (WD-XRF) analysis conducted in the Fitch Laboratory, again in collaboration 38 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 ί#.- ' κ\ Palaikastro . cvw°"a „ ™ Rousoiakos · .βο»"*1" ^ « "" - % ι iW Γ^ΊΝΙ •Petsofas ν 1 + Plakalona· 55.

Eretria was a key player in Greek colonization and in the wide diffusion of Greek material culture and practices during the early first millennium BC. Diachronic investigation of its pottery production explores the city's role in local, regional and Mediterranean networks. The first phase, completed in 2014, focused on material dating from Early Helladic II to late Middle Helladic, while the second, in progress, spans the Geometric to Hellenistic period. Analyses have identified the local fabrics in use throughout EHIIB and EHIII for coarse, medium-coarse and fine wares, covering a wide range of vessels used for food preparation and serving as well as storage and transport. Changes in local fabric recipes were observed during the Middle Helladic period, alongside a number of new elements in manu facturing technology. Imported fabrics also changed through the Bronze Age, probably indicating trans formations in the site's external relations and role in regional networks. Remaining with the work of the Fitch Laboratory, a selection of three projects is presented here, drawn from what is now a worldwide network of collaborations in research, infrastructure and outreach (Fig. 56). Fitch bursary holder Angelos Gkotsinas (Sheffield) worked on an Early Mycenaean zooarchaeological assemblage recovered in 2008 during rescue excavation on the Theodorou plot in Thebes directed by Vas silios Aravantinos. This well-preserved assemblage is the largest closely-dated and contextualized body of faunal material from Mycenaean Thebes. It was recovered, along with marine shells and various types of drinking and serving vessels, from a deep Late Helladic I pit just beneath the foundations of the palace. Preliminary results show a dataset covering 12 domestic and wild species/taxa. Sheep and pigs are most common, followed by cattle, goat and red deer. Dog, equids and hare occur in minimal quantities. Wild taxa include red deer, hare and possibly wild boar. The fairly high proportion of adult and elderly sheep and goats probably reflects emphasis on secondary products (wool and hair) in addition to meat consumption. 56.

Macroscopic observations of butchery marks are consistent with the use of metal tools and reflect all stages of carcass processing, with dismembering marks most common, followed by fil leting and chopping which is sometimes regularized, suggesting specialist butchery. Cut marks indicate that all identified species, including dogs and equids, were consumed even if on a small scale. The relatively rare red deer may have been hunted for prestige rather than as a food source, although there is ample evidence for the systematic exploitation of antlers. Working traces, including sawing and peeling or slicing marks, and specimens ranging from offcuts to preforms and unfinished objects, attest to the performance of all 57.

Gkotsinas. pilot study of antler working was undertaken on a sub sample of the assemblage. A new diachronic investigation of pottery production and supply at the Sanctuary of Zeus on Mount Lykaion led by the Fitch Laboratory Director, Evangelia Kiriatzi (under the aegis of the Mount Lykaion Excavation and Survey Project of the American School of Classical Studies and the 39th EPCA), focuses on a site strategically located on communication routes along the main southern Peloponnesian river valleys, with long-distance connections from Ithaca to central Arcadia and southern Laconia reflected in its material culture. Significant quantities of Neolithic to Hellenistic pottery were recovered from a large ash altar; while it is unclear whether the site was a cult place as early as the Final Neolithic, large numbers of Middle Helladic to Early Iron Age drinking cups likely relate to ritual practices. The dominant 'local' component was the focus of study. Pétrographie analysis identified nine fabrics among the coarser Final Neolithic to Middle Helladic pottery, while chemical analysis enabled five main compositional groups to be defined among Late Helladic to Early Iron Age finewares. Raw materials are in most cases compatible with local geology. Fabric continuity is observed through the Neolithic, Early Helladic and Middle Helladic periods (though diversification is also apparent), but chemical analysis indicates a strong preference for more cal careous fabrics in the Early Iron Age. Preliminary reading of this evidence suggests a shift in the sourcing of raw materials from highlands to lowlands. Neolithic fabrics reflect highland sources and the use of primary, non-calcareous and coarse clays, whereas Late Helladic and Early Iron Age fabrics are associated exclusively with secondary calcareous clays from lowland areas (and at least some with Neogene for mations). Despite the formal and technological stan dardization of the Late Helladic to Early Iron Age pottery from the altar, compositional variability prob ably reflects the use and/or dedication of pottery from a number of sources, possibly in the wider area. Finally, Fitch Scientific Research Officer Noémi Miiller began a new project on utilitarian ceramics through time (from material properties to manufac ture and consumption), focusing on the cooking wares which have long been a key part of the labora tory's research.

Their ultimate aim has been to elucidate the cultural, political and socio-economic factors which favour the perpetuation and transmission of traditions (or facilitate inno vation) for a material until recently integral to everyday life. The new project is a study of the renowned production of cooking pots on Siphnos through the 20th century (Fig. 58) (including the diaspora of Siph niot potters in the Aegean), integrating analytical data with archival material and interviews with tradi tional Siphniot potters. Continuing study following the Kenchreai Quarries Survey, directed by Chris Hayward (Edinburgh), focused on the so-called 'ploughed field' in Quarry Complex A and the 'inscribed quarries' in Complex B, aiming to date and characterize activity in broad terms of settlement, supply or production, and to assess the scale on which provision was made for different forms of activity, and from what sources of supply. mm ·&amp;'&gt;&lt; " ' l.jJfcï î. HHHHHHIHH % Mm m *' 59. Kenchreai, quarry Complex A: location of the 'ploughed field © BSA and Kenchreai Quarries Survey. The 'ploughed field' yielded 40% of all the pottery collected in 2013, the vast majority being Roman (Fig. 59). The densest concentrations, at the western end of the field, are effectively in situ. Fewer than ten prehistoric sherds were found (Early Helladic where datable); thereafter Archaic to Hellenistic were more common, with three concentrations observed. Classical wares included fine table vessels in a mixture of Corinthian and imported (mostly Attic) fabrics, plus Corinthian A and A' amphorae. Hellenistic pottery shows two chronological peaks which differ in character. The earlier, fourth-century material is finer, while the later, first-century BC peak is characterized by Aegean (northern Aegean, Koan and Rhodian) and Italian (Graeco-Italian, Lamboglia 2 and Campanian Dressel 2-4) transport amphorae and Eastern Sigillata A. Few Hellenistic cooking vessels or jugs were identified. The Early Imperial period is also lightly represented, with Aegean and Italian amphorae, cooking pots, Italian and regional sigillata, and lamps. Thereafter the volume of material increased through Middle Roman into the best represented period - the fifth to seventh century AD (Fig. 60). Much has been made of a Late Roman 'population explosion' visible in survey data, yet finds from the 'ploughed field' do not necessarily support this. A highly repetitive surface assemblage consisted of storage/transport vessels (LR2 and LR3 amphorae), drinking/serving bowls and plates (notably a restricted range of African red-slip forms), large cooking pots and lamps of types common (and presumably inexpensive) throughout the eastern Mediterranean. One or more of these was present in almost all collection units, while shapes such as deep basins, bins, jugs and loomweights, are strikingly absent. Close analysis of the distribution and co-occurrence of functional types, and the possibility of characterizing activity and identifying spatial variation, will follow. Despite a marked decline in activity after the seventh century, several ninth- to tenth-century basins and 13th- to 15th-century cooking pots come from the east of the field.

In Complex B, seven inscriptions occur in two groups in the north and south of the series of small pits that comprise the 'inscribed quarry' (Fig. 61 ). This grouping may reflect the removal of other inscriptions during subsequent quarrying or may denote separate, and not necessarily coeval, episodes of quarrying (as the ceramic evidence suggests).

The earliest sherd here (and in the complex as a whole) is an Attic stemless cup of the first quarter of the fifth century BC. Thereafter, evidence spans all periods through to Late Roman, with a few much later pieces too. This is the only part of the complex to produce a full range of open and closed vessels of all sizes, including provision for bulk storage.

Most sherds are Early to Middle Roman thin-walled cups consistent with the putative dates of the inscriptions. A small number of imprecisely datable Roman medium-scale open and closed vessels within the quarry include a few amphorae, with some smaller LR3 forms consistent with personal or small group provision of water. Less datable pithoi and bins were found both in the southern 'storage' area and on the eastern side of the complex outside (and in two cases inside) the quarry. Study of the chipped stone led by Georgia Kour tessi-Philippaki (Athens) focused on a sample of finds from Complex A outside the 'ploughed field'. This assemblage is in fresh condition and apparently in situ. Over 85% is flint, mostly derived from small pebbles similar to examples found in the vicinity. Their small size governed the module of the flint assemblage (Fig. 63). Pebbles were knapped in situ near the quarried area, with debris, cores, flakes and tools present in the sample. The chronocultural definition of this lithic assemblage is, however, a major challenge given the late date of the accompanying pottery.

Geophysics, excavation and field survey were used to investigate the spatial organization and preservation of a largely unexcavated zone in the northeast of the North Hill and by the eastern boundary of the site adjacent to the South Hill. Geophysics revealed 15 almost completely preserved houses and the partial plans of a further 15, with compacted floor layers (Fig. 64). The street grid continued to the north and east of the main area of David Robinson's 1928-1938 excavation, although in the north, close to the edge of the hill, differently aligned structures backed onto a probable perimeter wall. Magnetic data showed areas of intense burning or other fired features, such as hearths. The north eastern area of the North Hill may have been settled less densely or with different kinds of construction, but here too, intense magnetic responses suggest fired material. The supposed fortification wall on the eastern side of the North Hill also appears as a linear feature. Some of these features, including two new residential units on the North Hill and the fortification wall, were explored by excavation. In one unit, a party wall between two houses had on the western side a cobbled surface covered with fallen roof tiles and, on the eastern, a further tile concentration on a white lime floor. A floor elsewhere in the same unit produced numerous fragmentary vessels perhaps fallen from a shelf or upper storey. In the other unit, excavation revealed a pastas with two rooms behind. The walls of one were coated with red plaster which continued onto the floor, while the second contained a coarse limestone anta capital with a relief cornice. Investigation of a magnetic anomaly in the northern part of the North Hill revealed a north-south rubble wall with a large pithos to the east of it, and to the west a circular pit- or well-like construction covered with tiles and ringed with stones. Inside the stone ring were two large and complete upturned pots, together with a shallow bronze bowl (Fig. 65). At a lower level lay an east west wall of more carefully dressed blocks. Investigation of the supposed fortification wall revealed a 1,5m-wide layer of river stones which may represent the foundation of a mud-brick defensive wall. 65.

Preliminary assessment of the pottery reveals nothing earlier than the second quarter or later than the middle of the fourth century BC. While some vessels find parallels in Robinson's publications (notably Olynthus V and XIII), the range of medium and coarse shapes is wider, and most fmewares were probably local (contrary to Robinson's characterization of them as Attic). The vast majority of amphorae were prob ably also relatively local, with few imports even from Thasos. These suggestions will be further tested via a programme of fabric analysis in collaboration with the Fitch Laboratory. Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 45 65.

The project's study area covers the ancient city and its immediate hinterland. Survey here had the twin aims of understanding the functional and chronological distribution of artefacts over the North Hill, the South Hill and Eastern Slope (defining the eastern boundary of the Classical city), and assessing the roles played by the immediate hinterland in antiquity. On the North Hill, surface collection prior to excavation combined random sampling with total collection and grab sampling of diagnostic artefacts, providing arte fact density figures for a select portion of each grid square, plus information about chronology and function for the whole area. In the hinterland, field-walking to the east of the South Hill located an uncultivated mound containing several large rock piles for which surface pottery indicates a fourth-century BC date, as well as an in situ pithos close to the East Spur Hill. Discussion of Olynthos recalls the work of School members in the region during the Balkan Wars and World War 1, and in particular Alan Wace's account of his visit to the site in the winter of 1915 published in the BSA Annual for 1916 in the expectation that the School would soon begin excavation. As reflection on the causes and impact of World War I accompanies commemoration of the centenary of its outbreak, School research is increasingly turning to the long-neglected Salonica Front. The second Archaeology Behind the Battle Lines colloquium, in collaboration with the British Museum (Department of Greece and Rome), the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the Musée du Louvre, examined the nature and significance of the archaeological activities of the armies stationed on the front and of the Greek archaeo logical service newly established in Macedonia, as well as the fate of the collections (Fig. 66). The School Archive has also collaborated in the CENDARI (Collaborative European Digital Archive Infrastructure) initiative to integrate digital resources for the study of World War I by contributing personal diaries, corre spondence and photographs from the longest-established British family resident in Greece, the Noel-Bakers of Euboea. Part of this material concerns Philip Noel-Baker, Captain of the Friends'Ambulance Unit (Fig. 67) and his future wife Irene, a Red Cross nurse who helped to set up and run hospital and recovery services; the couple met while on the front in France and continued to work together in Belgium and Italy. 46 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="47">The work of the British School at Athens, 2014-2015 67.

Debate focused on the public institu tions that deliver healthcare, education and welfare services, on state-economy relations, the historical factors behind the present form and operation of agencies, and the challenges to be met. A major issue was the way in which the EU, via its accession policy, has created a frontier zone in a way never conceived within the terms of the greater European project and the extent to which it is now able or willing to manage this situation. The School also hosted a workshop on photography, entitled Imagfinjing Crisis, which brought together anthro pologists and visual practitioners to approach the Greek crisis as simultaneously a field of experience, ΒΙΑΑΙλτανκλΚ"1™" '·'}· acaSemv ^ an object of representation, a sphere of affect and a 68.

Archaeology in Greece has a long history of reporting epigraphic discoveries, and in recent years the print versions have highlighted a number of finds which have added little by little to our understanding of the history and topography of ancient Athens, including many of the reports now available online (see, for example, inscriptions helping to identify the Sanctuary of Apollo Pythios [ID4053] and of Zeus Meili chios [Map 3, no. 1; ID4557], or new voting sherds from the Athenian procedure of ostracism [Map 3, no. 5; ID1877]). Archaeology in Greece Online tags epigraphic material within its reports, allowing the reader to search for inscriptions as a keyword and also by region (such as Attica). This review of recent Athenian epigraphic developments focuses on major finds of the last decade, in particular focusing on discoveries reported in periodicals and publications from Greece, which some may find difficult to access, and is of course a personal and only a small selection of the voluminous literature on the subject (for more thorough coverage readers are pointed to SEG, the superb annual review of all epigraphy-related publications). doi: 10.1017/S057060841500006X Archaeological Reports 61 (2014-2015)49-55</page><page sequence="50">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 Recent finds The topography of central Athens still holds many secrets, and one perennial problem has been the location of the Archaic agora and the Prytaneion, the old heart of the city with the hearth of Hestia and several buildings topographically linked with it. Searches moved from the north of the Acropolis when an in scription recording honours for a priestess of Aglauros (now in the New Acropolis Museum, see below) was found in 1980, locating her sanctuary - and with it, the centre of early Athens - to the east of the Acropolis (for the general area see Longo 2011). More recently, Geoffrey Schmalz (2006) has attempted to associate the Prytaneion with the remains of the Roman peristyle building within the square of Agia Aikaterini (but see now Kroustalis 2013). Excavations completed in 2006 in a plot (32 Tripodon Street) bordering the ancient Street of the Tripods 150m east of the great cave of Aglauros brought to light an in scription, adding further to the debate about the location of the Prytaneion (Map 3, no. 3, Fig. 71; Kav vadias and Matthaiou 2014). The remains of a significantly large building were partly uncovered, as well as a pit full of much dining ware dating to the last quarter of the fourth century BC and perhaps the debris of public dining nearby. The inscription is unfortunately very fragmentary, but dates from the second quarter of the fifth century BC and contains references to prytaneis and prytaneion, as well as vocabulary of administration and types of dining vessels, adding weight to the theory that the Prytaneion could have existed nearby. 71.

A cup discovered in 2014 during the excavation of an otherwise poor fifth-century tile grave in the north ern Athenian suburb of Kiphissia caused a media frenzy when it was reported to have been inscribed by the great statesman Perikles (Fig. 72). Temporarily exhibited at the Epigraphic Museum, and now pub lished (Daskalaki 2010-2013), this black-glazed skyphos dating from ca. 480 465 BC had been turned upside down, perhaps after a drinking party, and within an etched frame were scratched the names Αριστείδο, Διοδότο, Δαισίμο, Άρρίφρονος, Περι κλέος and Ε[ύ]κρίτο.

The name Arriphron is rare in Athens and principally occurs within the family of Perikles, and the presence here of the two names in combination strongly suggests we have the famous brothers. One interesting addition to the base of the cup (in Ionic rather than the otherwise Attic script) is the (perhaps slave) name Δραπέτης, possibly the wine server who took the cup after the drinking party and kept it as a token of this memorable evening. A graffito found in the Plaka in 2002 may also relate to a known individual (Sourlas 2014). A plot excavated south of the Roman agora (Mousaiou Street; Map 3, no. 4) revealed a deposit of household pottery, including the base of a lekythos of the second quarter or mid fifth century BC inscribed Μίρανα καλά | καί φίλα το δοκδν I Εύμάρει, a type of kalos-inscription and perhaps, given the vessel, a gift of perfumed oil from Eumares. The female recipient of this praise could be the Murrina (sic) mentioned in a scholion to Aristophanes' Clouds as a hetaira, upon whom Leogoras, the father of Andokides, lavished his fortune, a theory made more attractive by the finding in this excavation of building foundations of fine polygonal limestone within Kydathenaion, the deme where Leogoras' family is known to have had a house. A small inscribed fragment of the Altar of Apollo Pythios was discovered in March 2009 in a rescue excavation of the 3rd EPCA at 3 Iosiph ton Rogon (Map 3, no. 2; Charami and Bardani 2011). It was quickly recognized by Voula Bardani as a missing piece of the altar mentioned by Thucydides and on per manent display in the Epigraphic Museum (IG I3 948). The find is particularly important, since it deter mines the find-spot of the crowning of the altar found in 1877 and helps to confirm the location here of the Sanctuary of Apollo (for the archaeological, literary and epigraphic evidence for the location of the sanctuary, see Matthaiou 2011). The excavation in 2000 of the casualty list of those who died in the Battle of Marathon from the tribe Erechtheis excited interest and debate, which has only grown louder with the principal publication of the in scription (Steinhauer 2004-2009). The stone was excavated in the Peloponnesian villa of Herodes Atticus in Loukou, reused as a pilaster capital in the Late Roman period and contains an epigram for the fallen and then a list (perhaps not complete) of the tribe's 22 dead (which with ten tribes would give a number close to the 192 reported perished), arranged in an unusual stoichedon manner with alternate lines offset giving a pleasing chequerboard effect (Butz 2015). Two further fragments, with similar writing but only a few pre served letters, appear to come from other stelae, in what is assumed to be a series of tribal lists, set up after the battle, at the polyandreion of Marathon. Herodes must then have moved them to his country estate, it is argued, in order to decorate his villa (and his well-known interest in inscriptions is further confirmed recently by the finding of another copy of the curses for Polydeukion: ID1753). New readings, emendations and translations of the epigram have become an industry in printed form as well as in the blogosphere, along with discussions of whether this really can be the original stele or a later copy, or indeed a complete Roman forgery (for important new autopsy of the stone and previous bibliography, see Tentori Montalto 2014). Richard Janko (2014) offers a translation of the epigram into English elegiacs: Go tell the valour of these men, that passed forever from daylight reaching Earth's ends. 'How they died?,' one will ask. Fighting the Medes - and they crowned Athens with victory's garland, few though they were, up against many in war. A new fragment of the inscription for the Athenian heroes of Phyle (404/3 BC; SEG XXVIII45) was identified in the archives of the Archaeological Society of Athens in 2002 among the archival papers of Panagiotis Eustratiadis, who drew the fragment in 1873. Georgia Malouchou (2010-2013) located the fragment, now much damaged, in the Epigraphic Museum (inv. no. EM 2756) and it was shown to join with other fragments of the monument. The new fragment contains part of the epigram and decree for the heroes, and the preservation of part of the archon's name shows that the monument dates in fact to 401/0 BC and not 403/2 BC, as often previously assumed. Further, the architectural reconstruction of the block shows that the monument, one of the most important in the agora of Athens at the end of the fifth century, was not a stele but a base, on which most probably stood a statue. Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 ( 51</page><page sequence="52">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 Our understanding of the Attic countryside and the people who used it owes a great deal in recent decades to the work of Merle Langdon and his discovery of a whole world of (often Archaic) inscriptions and images carved into the bedrock of the Attic hills. Many of these graffiti identify their owners as shepherds and goatherds, idling away their time waiting for grazing flocks by writing their names, mes sages to other shepherds, sexual insults and invective, or drawing the world around them (Fig. 73; for some of the many boat engravings, see Langdon and Van de Moortel 2000). Many epigraphists (the present author included) have had the fortune to visit these inscriptions with Langdon and can confirm what a Herculean task it is to find and read these weather-beaten rocks. Langdon kindly informs AG (personal communication) that his forthcoming cor pus now numbers around 2,000 verbal and non-ver bal graffiti, which will no doubt radically alter our picture of numerous aspects of Archaic Athens, not least our assessment of Athenian literacy. Of the published graffiti, one find that stands out is a com plete mid sixth-century BC Old Attic abecedarium -*Μ^"7ί 3jjpK9iUd| inscribed on Barako hill in Vari, which includes the ,, .... only letter san found in an Attic inscription and was 73.

Langdon. off his alphabetic skills (Fig. 74; Langdon 2005). Among some 50 inscriptions on the same rock out crop, one shepherd leaves his letters as a marker of his presence ([-]σθινο είμι μνήμα ποιμαί[νοντος - ]) and another writes a message to other shepherds ([-] γιγνόσκιν, δ ποιμένε[ς -]). A unique variation on the ubiquitous kalos inscription was discovered in 2000 on the lower western slopes of Hymettos, above Argyroupolis, where previously other boundary markers, feet outlines and names were recorded (Langdon 1985). Below a foot outline (planta pedis) is the inscription (ca. 500 BC) in four lines: Αίθονίδες καλός καταπύγον Ιιεκόν, perhaps an ironic praise acknowledging Aithonides' beauty, with the stinging comment that he was rather eager and willing in the performance of sexual favours (Lang don 2004). In 2012 another late sixth-century graffito was found in the area of Bertseko hill, south of Agios Konstantinos (Kamariza) by a local man out walking: [-?- Έ]ύθυδίκο χάριεν Κλεβις τάδ' εγρα&lt;φσ&gt;εν άνφοΐν χαύτδ μνεμα φιλεμοσύνες (Fig. 75). The inscription appears to be in elegiac cou plets and, although some text is perhaps missing, the sense is that Klebis wrote the letters as a mnema (here a memento or marker) of the friendship which he and Euthydikos shared (Matthaiou and Rossiou 2010-2013). if'V/A - - - &gt; 'Vg ■ Ο fi·. 73.

On the floor of the Parthenon gallery can be found the regulations following the revolt of Chalkis from the Athenian Empire (IG I3 40) and selections of the building accounts for the chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos (inv. nos EM 6769, 6765); while parts of the Erechtheion building accounts (inv. nos EM 6667, 6661b) and the fa mous stele with decrees setting up a priestess and temple of Athena Nike on the Acropolis (IG I3 35/36) stand beside their respective temple's sculptural remains, on the second floor. The fifth-century BC to fifth-century AD gallery con tains important decrees and treaties showcasing Athenian foreign policy from the Classical and Hellenistic periods, many with spectacular document reliefs; an interactive screen provides Greek texts and translations of 12 of these inscriptions, including the decree honouring the Samians (IG II2 1) at the end of the fifth century and honours for Arybbas, king of the Molossians (IG II2 226 = II3 411). A catalogue of the inscribed material in the galleries of the National Archaeological Museum has also been pub lished (Papoutsaki and Kalliontzis 2004-2009), listing prin cipal publications, gallery and references to inventory numbers of the museum as well as to Nikolaos Kaltsas' cat alogue (2002). The Epigraphic Museum welcomed a new acquisition in 2012: the sacrificial calendar of Thorikos (IG I3 256bis), il legally removed from Greece and bought in 1979 by the J. Paul Getty Museum, which voluntarily returned the stele and other antiquities following an agreement with the Greek Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Fig. 76).

In the same series, the Late Roman inscriptions (IG II/IIF part V) came out in 2008 (Sironen 2008), while 2015 saw the publication of the volume on the public dedications and choregic monuments (Cubera and Makres 2015). The Packard Humanities Institute (PHI) continues its project to make available online all Greek epi graphic texts, Searchable Greek Inscriptions, now available in a version prepared so as to avoid technical problems involving Java (http://noapplet.epigraphy.packhum.org/). An invaluable complement to these cor pora is Attic Inscriptions Online (https://www.atticinscriptions.com/), a project directed by Stephen Lambert which aims to provide translations and brief notes of Athenian inscriptions, with links to the PHI texts. Keeping up with the wealth of new names and onomastic publications from ancient Athens is made signif icantly easier by Sean Byrne's online Athenian Onomasticon (http://www.seangb.org/index.php), which updates the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (Osborne and Byrne 1994) and Foreign Residents of Athens (Osborne and Byrne 1996), includes up to the latest SEG (volume LX [2010]) and IG II/III3 volumes, and provides useful search facilities on full or fragmentary names, sorted by demes, tribes or chronologically. A wealth of images of Athenian inscriptions and squeezes is available for teaching and research pur poses through the Center for Epigraphical and Palaeographical Studies at Ohio State University (https://epigraphy.osu.edu/) and Oxford's Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents (http://www.csad.ox. ac.uk/CSAD/Catalogue.html), the latter with extensive further links to electronic resources. Epigraphy will no doubt see further developments of digital applications, imaging and computer techno logies. One fascinating experiment has offered a glimpse into this new world. Steven Tracy, whose ground breaking work focuses on the recognition of the hands of cutters of Athenian inscriptions, has collaborated with colleagues from the National Technical University of Athens in preparing a computer program which can perform the same identification exercise of hands from images of the stones. Images of six inscriptions were analysed in order to extract the specific geometric characteristics of each letter, and a formula pro duced for the mean values and variance of these letters. Three further inscriptions were then used as a test case against the reference set and the program identified all three as belonging to hands it recognized from the reference set, then confirmed as correct by Tracy (Tracy et al. 2007; brief summary in Tracy and Pa podysseus 2009). If the technology could be developed one day to perform quickly the same task on large numbers of inscriptions, the results could bring together many separated fragments and answer numerous other questions about date and provenance.

These finds enrich our knowledge of the deme's city planning, domestic architecture, water system, quarries, ports and walls in the Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods. The Hippodamian grid plan and habitation Since Klaus-Valtin von Eickstedt's (1991) seminal study on the Hippodamian development of the Piraeus, which was based on excavation data for houses and roads, more evidence has become available. Numerous new domestic complexes have been excavated on the Akte (ID1718, ID4907, ID4908, ID4909, ID4935, ID4981, ID4982, ID4983, ID4984, ID4985; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Bl: 441-42) and on the rest of the peninsula (ID4877, ID4910, ID4914, ID4915, ID4932). New roads and sections of roads already included in Hôpfner and Schwandner 1994 (fig. 14) have been revealed in several areas (ID1718, ID2438, ID4907, ID4908, ID4909, ID4921, ID4935, ID4937; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Bl : 442). Amongst these is the road that ran between the Long Stoa and the walls of the Piraeus (ID4937). Additionally, a horos stone, marking the limits of the Emporion and its adjacent road, was found in Akte Miaouli. The inscription had been built into the wall of a small rubble structure; the date of the structure has not been identified, but it is thought to postdate the Classical period (ID4935). The horos reads: ΕΜΠΟΡΙΟ[Υ] ΚΑΙ ΗΟΔΟ[Y] ΗΟΡΟΣ Apart from roads, numerous cisterns (ID 4877, ID4908, ID4909, ID4913, ID4914, ID4915, ID4921, ID4924, ID4981, ID4986; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Β1: 441-42) and quarries (ID1718, ID2439, ID4909, ID4911, ID4912, ID4915, ID4916, ID4917, 1D4918, 1D4919, ID4920, ID4922, ID4923, ID4925, IDD4926, ID4927, ID4928, ID4929, ID4930, ID4931, ID4932, ID4935, ID4981, ID4983, ID4984, ID4985, ID4986; ADelt 56 59 [2001-2004] Bl: 441-42) have come to light. Most of the cis terns were discovered under or adjacent to domestic complexes, l. . · ' Few of them were found in isolation and they serve as strong indi cations of nearby habitation. Especially in cases when two or more cisterns are found interconnected with a system of corbelled-roofed shafts, a large domestic complex nearby is almost certainly implied (Fig. 77). Of the aforementioned quarries, one is justifiably asso ciated by Kornelia Axioti with the construction of nearby shipsheds (ID4911). ID4917 lies outside the walls of the Piraeus and can plau sibly be associated with the construction of the walls. All the other quarries (except for ID4981, see Fig. 79, which will be discussed below) are relatively small, and most are connected to domestic complexes. With the exception of six quarries (ID1718, ID4927, ID4929, ID4922, ID4930, ID4926), all had wall remains and/or cisterns in their precincts. Most importantly they are located in the gridded part of the Piraeus asty. These quarries were evidently asso 77.

Accordingly, most roads had developed drainage systems. The houses consisted of a central courtyard with a pebble floor, around which extended all the rooms of the house. The andron commonly had an elaborate mosaic floor. Water was primarily obtained from wells, cisterns and complex systems of shafts joining nearby cisterns. The mouths of the cisterns were most commonly located in the courtyard of the house or the roofed area between the courtyard and the andron. Since many of the quarries in the Piraeus were small and served the needs of house construction, they saved the population of the Piraeus the expense of transporting stone even for short distances. Only the larger quarries, some of which were located outside the walls of the Piraeus, were used for the extraction of stone for fortification walls in Athens and the Piraeus, and for exports (also see Lygouri-Tolia 2013: 19). Of the recently excavated houses, most date to the Classical period - with the majority of these dating to the fourth century BC. Some date to Hellenistic times. Unlike Steinhauer and Eickstedt (see also Lygouri-Tolia 2013: 25), the reports (ID1718, ID4907, ID4908, ID4909, ID4935, ID4981, ID4982, ID4983, ID4984, ID4985) make no mention of the size of the house in relation to its date. Nevertheless, Steinhauer's and Eickstedt's analyses, which show that Hellenistic houses were more spacious than Clas sical ones and Roman houses even larger than these, are supported indirectly by the complexes of cisterns that have come to light. Some of the cistern-joining shafts appear to postdate the cisterns. It is therefore possible that as houses grew in size, so the cisterns that had previously served the needs of different houses were connected by means of corbelled shafts to serve the needs of a single, expanded household. This view is supported by Stella Chryssoulaki, who has reported the excavation of one of the largest cistern complexes found to date in the Piraeus (ID4877). Chryssoulaki argues that different types of cisterns date to different periods, and that the shafts were constructed at times when the demand for water increased, i.e. possibly when house sizes increased. Apart from verifying what we already knew about the Piraeus town centre, recent excavation data also provide new information on the Hippodamian city plan. First, the excavation data from Akte push the habitation area further to the west, beyond the previously understood boundary. In other words, Classical houses extended beyond Herodotou Street to Sophokleous Street. Secondly, extensive clusters of quarries, cisterns and houses provide detailed snapshots of the habitation area in the Classical period. What follows is the analysis of finds from two streets in Akte: Zaimi and Mavrokordatou. Most of the data presented come from recent excavations. Relevant data from older rescue excavations are also included, in order to obtain a precise picture of a small area.

The ancient roads run northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast, as do, roughly, the modern roads in the rest of the Piraeus peninsula (excluding the Akte). The modern-day Akte roads run north-northwest to south-southeast and east-northeast to west-suthwest. Consequently, the finds from Zaimi and Mavrokordatou Streets that will be discussed come from several Classical blocks of houses and not from a single Classical road (Map 4). Nine sites have been excavated over a distance of © Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs. mouth of a cistern. The sole remains of Block C consist of a section of a pebble floor, which belonged to the courtyard or the andron of a house. Block D is identified by the excavator as a commercial building; its walls are not carefully constructed and they delimit a row of narrow rooms. This ground-plan finds no parallels in the domestic architecture of the Piraeus. Additionally, the numerous bronze coins, Hellenistic amphora sherds and fragments of terracotta figurines that were found in these rooms support the interpre tation that this was a commercial building. West of the these blocks, a bell-shaped cistern does not appear to be connected to any of the four blocks, but to another house yet to be identified and excavated. The excavator remarks that the roads that delimit these blocks do not have a uniform width as they run along side the aforementioned buildings. One of the roads has an extensive system of drains and pipes that runs underneath it. Very close to these four blocks, on Flessa and Salaminomachon Streets where, as previously mentioned, Block A continues, Michalopoulou reports the discovery of another two Late Classical houses (ID4982). One contained a pebble floor and a drain. These houses do not lie directly on Zaimi Street but very close to it and could belong to a block extending from Zaimi diagonally to the corner of Flessa and Salamino machon Street. Fifty metres from the corner of Flessa and Salaminomachon Street, at 36 Zaimi Street, part of another Classical house with a well was reported in 1978 (ADelt 33 [1978] Bl: 44). Across the street from this, at 33-35 Zaimi Street, Petrakos had reported a year earlier the discovery of a road and 58 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 Λ à».' 78.

There was no datable material to assist with the interpretation of these walls. Another 55m south from this plot, at 46-48 Zaimi and Theotoki Streets, Petrakos reported in the same year the discovery of a limestone quarry, with a house and a well constructed in the quarry's precinct. Petrakos noted that the quarry, after its initial use, made an appropriate space to accommodate a house. A staircase constructed on the block courses of the quarry provided access to the lowest floor of the house. This would certainly have been below street level (ADelt 32 [1977] Bl: 37). Only 70m south of this quarry, at 60 Zaimi Street, another small limestone quarry was excavated. No wall remains were reported from within or around its precinct (ADelt 32 [1977] Bl: 37). Finally, Kornelia Axioti reports on the excavation of a third quarry, 50m south from the last, at 70-72 Zaimi and Kleisouras Streets (Fig. 79; ID4981). This quarry was briefly mentioned above as one of the largest excavated in Akte. Its size differentiates it from the small quarries located between domestic complexes. Nevertheless, Axioti reports that wall remains were found on both the northern and south eastern sides of it. Additionally, the northern wall delimited a paved area, i.e. possibly the courtyard of a house. It is therefore possible that, despite its size, this quarry too would have provided blocks for house 79. Piraeus, 70-72 Zaimi and Kleisouras Streets: quarry. construction. It is also not unlikely that enough Stone © Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs. would have been extracted from this quarry to be transported and used elsewhere as well. To sum up, the only dating provided for the area under consideration is broadly in the Classical and Hellenistic periods. This area was most likely a neighbourhood that was continuously inhabited for at least two centuries. Over a 350metre-long stretch, transecting a minimum of six Hippodamian grid squares, the following finds were located: eight houses and the possible remains of another four; one commercial building contemporary with the houses; four cisterns; three wells; three roads; and three quarries of which one contained house remains and another lay between possible house remains. This neighbourhood con sisted of houses with a pebble courtyard and a paved andron. Water for these households was obtained from wells and cisterns. The demand for water did not appear to be too high, since no complex system of shafts has been reported, uniting several cisterns and increasing their capacity. Perhaps these Classical houses were not enlarged in the Hellenistic period, and so the needs of each household with respect to water did not change considerably. Any increase in demand could have been met by the addition of another well or cistern, as opposed to the construction of more costly underground structures. Mavrokordatou Street lies to the west and runs parallel to Zaimi Street. Eight sites have been excavated along a 270m-long stretch. Michalopoulou reports the discovery of a bell-shaped cistern with a shaft and a quarry at 12 Mavrokordatou Street (Fig. 80; ID4983). Axioti reported the discovery of an 8m-wide road, with houses on either side of it at number 27. The latter plot is only 30m from the former. One of the two houses reported by Axioti had an andron with an elaborately decorated pebble floor and a courtyard with a plain pebble floor (Fig. 81). A drain diverted rainwater from this domestic complex to the road running in front of it. Additionally, a cistern excavated in this plot appears to belong to a third, unexca vated house (ID4908). Thirty five metres from this plot, another road and a Classical house have been excavated (ID4909). The Bn D ,·,,, , , , , ,, v 7 oil.

Less than 20m from this plot, on the junction of Mavrokordatou and Salaminomachon Street, Michalopoulou reports the discovery of a fouth-century BC house, with floors of beaten earth and a pebble floor in its southwestern corner (ID4983). The pebble-floor area was most likely the area of the courtyard, since a drain, which runs into a bell-shaped cistern, was revealed in it. Two shafts with corbelled roofs had been constructed on the southwestern and southeastern walls of the cistern.

Petrakos noted © Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs. that this house had two different phases of use: the first in the early and the second in the late fourth century BC. He also noted that two of the wells belong to the first phase and the third to the second phase. Finally, in the last 180m of the investigated stretch of road, a quarry and two cisterns have been excavated at 44, 57 and 58 Mavrokordatou Street {ADelt 32 [1977] B1 : 36; ADelt 35 [1980] B1 : 56; von Eickstedt 1991: 223). One of the two cisterns was found in proximity (ca. 30m ) to the quarry, whilst the other was located further away from it. The only dating material provided for some of the structures in this area belongs broadly to the fourth century. Its proximity to Zaimi Street, where numerous Classical remains have also been found, indicates that this stretch of road transects another part of roughly the same neighbourhood. In total, another three quarries (one of which had a house in it), eight cisterns (two of which had shafts), six houses, two roads and three wells have been reported. This area of Akte was evidently densely populated in the Classical and Hellenistic periods and abandoned after that time. Based on the sites reported from both these streets, various conclusions can be drawn regarding (house) construction in the Piraeus. As previously mentioned, the existence of small quarries which provided build ing material for adjacent building complexes was already known, as was the fact that most were used as land for houses after having fallen out of use as stone extraction sites. This practice is not unique to the Piraeus, but is well attested in Classical and Hellenistic Greece (for example, for recent evidence, see ID4988, ID4989). Focusing on Zaimi and Mavrokordatou Streets, the frequency of quarry sites within the gridded area of the Piraeus needs to be a specific topic of study. In Akte, it appears that there was a quarry site for every three to five houses in its immediate vicinity. The total extent of these, mainly small, quarry sites adds up to a high percentage of the populated land of the peninsula. The subsequent use of the quarry sites as plots for domestic complexes, however, does not reflect exclusively the practice of making the most out of the land in densely-populated city-states. In my opinion, it also relates to the topog- ? _ raphy of the quarry sites. The foundations of houses in the Piraeus were commonly laid on bedrock. The ."j *v'_ f* . yS " jmt latter needed to be worked and levelled in places to jjjft i- * . ' τί^Β receive building foundations.

Piraeus, 15 Sophokleous Street: quarry site. © Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs.</page><page sequence="61">New discoveries in the Piraeus terns were constructed in out-of-use quarry sites as frequently as houses. This indicates that the topography of the quarries was manipulated in whatever way was more convenient, i.e. whether for building on top of and/or for digging further into the bedrock. At this point I note that Steinhauer (2003: 41) has argued that the Themistoclean Sanctuary of Aphrodite, with its later Kononian phase, was located in the quarry on the Eetioneia promontory. This may appear at first to be unrelated to Akte, and the investigated Classical and Hellenistic neighbourhood, but it is actually very relevant. In my opinion, based on (a) the number of quarry sites in the Piraeus (and elsewhere) that were subsequently used as plots of land for construction (including sanctuaries)1 and (b) the topography of the Eetioneia quarry, which is flat and accommodating for a building, fence, altar or any combination of these, Steinhauer's view is firmly grounded (for different views on the location of this sanctuary, which have influenced experts on Greek religion, see Foucart 1887: 140—44; Funke 1983). Moreover, the fact that this proposed subsequent use of the Eetioneia quarry has left no traces in the archaeological record shows that even more quarry sites (in the Piraeus) than has previously been thought could have been used as plots for buildings; the structures built into them may simply not have left any readable traces. Breaking stone in the Piraeus appears to have been constant and to have taken place everywhere on the peninsula. Apart from quarrying, a considerable part of the peninsula was hollowed for the construction of wells, cisterns and the shafts connecting them. As shown by the numbers reported previously, every house had a cistern, well or both, and some cisterns were extended or connected to nearby ones by means of shafts. When these structures are looked at individually, the volume of bedrock extracted from the Piraeus is not immediately evident (Fig. 77). In cases like the recent discovery of the most extensive system of such interconnecting and/or adjacent cisterns found in the Piraeus (ID4877), the potential is raised of being able to calculate the man-hours invested and the tonnage of rock. Returning to our Classical and Hellenistic neighbourhood where quarries operated and later ceased to function, where new houses were constructed and older ones repaired, and where water requirements con stantly increased and were met by the construction of new wells, cisterns and shafts, it appears that this was a noisy place to live; so much so that the acoustemology of the Piraeus possibly requires a separate study. A study by geologists published in 2000 states that the Piraeus had two types of limestone: hard lime stone (some of it dolomite), which is to be found on Akte and was referred to as Aktite stone, and soft marly limestone, which is found on the rest of the peninsula (Theoulakis and Bardanis 2000). The Classical and Hellenistic neighbourhood previously described was constructed on a hard limestone bedrock, whilst the extensive complex of cisterns and shafts (ID4877) was carved in softer limestone. Still, despite the difference in the quality of these two types of limestone and the effort required to break or extract either one, quarries and cisterns are to be found everywhere on the peninsula (ID1718, ID2439, ID4909, ID4911, ID4912, ID4915, ID4916, ID4917, ID4918, ID4919, ID4920, ID4922, ID4923, ID4925, IDD4926, ID4927, ID4928, ID4929, ID4930, ID4931, ID4932, ID4935, ID4981, ID4983, ID4984, ID4985, ID4986; ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] Bl: 441^12). Between Zea and Mounichia Important new finds have come to light in the coastal area between the harbours of Zea and Mounichia (Map 4; ID 2442). Maria Petritaki reports the discovery of a section of the Piraeus fortifications. The wall runs along the southern edge of the rock of the hill of Kastella, breaking towards the east where the rock becomes vertical. The outer face of this section of the wall was constructed with stone blocks filled with smaller stones. The remains of a rectangular structure (17m χ 3.7m) were identified inside the fortifications. Based on the numerous dedicatory stelae found in this area and the votive offerings to Asklepios (representations of human body parts, mainly from young boys and girls), it appears that the Asklepieion extended further south than previously thought, up to the fortification wall. Amongst the finds is a headless statue of a young girl holding a goose, dating to the fourth century BC (Fig. 83). 1 I wish to thank both Olga Palagia and Catherine Morgan for drawing my attention to the fact that there are parallels of sanctuaries constructed in quarries (for example, in Corinth, on the Pnyx).

Piraeus, Poseidonos and 1 Gounari Streets: the Long Stoa. © Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs. More on the fortifications A third section of the ditch following the Piraeus walls was excavated in 6 Fokionos Street (ID4906). The ditch is 9m long, 2.5-5m wide and 4.4m deep. It lies 18m north of the walls. The excavator remarks that, so far, only three other sections of the ditch have been located in the Piraeus: one by the Eetioneia Gate and the other two on Gounari Street. Additionally, parts of the road that run outside the northern arm of the Long Walls and connected the Piraeus with the Athenian asty have been excavated (ID2445; also see Lygouri-Tolia 2013: 21). Wheel ruts were visible along the road's surface. This road was the preferred route for people to travel to and from the Piraeus in antiquity. Roman Piraeus New finds dating to Roman times have been excavated around Kantharos harbour. First, the Long Stoa, the largest of the Emporion stoas, was found at Poseidonos and 1 Gounari Streets, along the northeastern part of the harbour (Fig. 84). Petritaki reports the discovery a 27.2m section of this stoa (ID4937). Its back wall was built of Piraeus limestone and its stylobate had a Roman phase. South of this stoa, on the eastern side of Kantharos (10 Akte Miaouli) more harbour installations were identified (ID4936). They have a north-south orientation, and they face east, towards the sea. They consist of 11 rooms covering a length of 117m. Some of the rooms are identified as warehouses, with several phases of use, repairs and extension. They are dated to the Late Roman/Early Christian period. Much of the building material in this complex appears to have come from the Classical Emporion installations. Lastly, a large Roman complex was excavated along the southern side of the harbour (ID4935). It consisted of 27 rooms, iden tified as shops and/or workshops, and contained a hoard of 837 silver and silver-plated coins. The 62 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 83.

Finally, a house with a cistern was excavated halfway between Kantharos and Zea (ID4910). This Late Roman house had been constructed on top of a Classical one and contained a hoard of 236 coins (for the latest study on the population of the Piraeus in the Roman period, see Grigoropoulos 2009). Portable finds Chryssoulaki reports on numerous finds - many organic - excavated from the large cisterns-and-shafts complex at Agiou Konstantinou Square (ID4877). Most of these water installations are below sea level, and wooden finds and seeds were preserved since they remained adequately hydrated and in anaerobic conditions due to the quality of the silt that covered them. These finds include wooden parts from furni ture, half a wooden door, olive stones, grape pips, various types of nut, pine nuts and acorns, a wooden pulley and traces of rope, probably from the mechanism for drawing water from a well, and a wooden comb. At a depth of -1.12m below sea level (14.17m below ground level), a wooden statue of a standing, clothed male figure (Fig. 85) lay face down on the northern wall of the shaft, within a stratum that contained pottery dating from the end of the Hellenistic period. The figure, which is 0.47m tall and 0.21m wide (missing the head and parts of the limbs), wears a short chiton and stands in a striding pose with the right leg bent forwards and the left extended backwards. The elbows are bent at the waist, arms extended. Apart from the wooden statue, stone statuettes were also excavated: a fragment of a marble statuette of Artemis riding a deer, a stone statuette of Kybele and a headless stat uette of a standing female figure. The first was found near the aforementioned, large wooden statue. Other finds from this S5 pimeus Agl0u Konstantinou Square: complex include bronze vessels, pottery and buckets for col- wooden statue. © Ministry of Culture, lecting water. In total, the number and quality of finds that Education and Religious Affairs. came out of these underground structures is overwhelming and we look forward to their publication as well as to the study and publication of the complex in the proceedings of the workshop entitled Research into the Piraeus'Ancient Water Supply Systems Revealed during the METRO Works, held on 15th May 2015. This fascinating workshop was the result of a collab oration between the 26lh EPCA and the School of Civil Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. Conclusions Several new finds have come to light in the Piraeus since the publication of von Eickstedt's (1991) and Robert Garland's (2001) studies on the peninsula. Apart from the completion of the excavation and pub lication of the shipshed complexes in Zea and Mounichia, which was reported in AR 60, numerous rescue excavations have revealed new domestic complexes, quarries, roads, systems of cisterns, sections of the walls, harbour installations and parts of sanctuaries. These discoveries enrich our knowledge of Classical, Hellenistic and Roman Piraeus. Finally, it should be noted that a very useful article incorporating some of these new results with older studies on the Piraeus has been published by Eftychia Lygouri-Tolia (2013). This article is one of the most recent publications on the Piraeus and is a valuable contribution to the study of the port of Athens. Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 63 85.

Over the past ten years, the regions of Euboea, Phokis and Lokris have yielded epigraphic material that is not only abundant, but also very varied - whether viewed in chronological, thematic or archaeological terms.1 All three regions have, for example, produced new manumission records, including the very first for the island of Euboea. The use of inscriptions has made crucial contributions to the identification of several Euboean sanctuaries, such as that of Apollo Selinaios, in the territory of Histiaia, that of Artemis Amarysia, near Amarynthos, and Apollo Delios at Zarex. The sanctuary located at the top of the acropolis of Eretria is now understood to be a sanctuary of Athena, thanks to an inscribed statuette of a lion. The region of Phokis in particular has yielded very diverse epigraphy. Once again, inscriptions asso ciated with sanctuaries stand out, with, for example, a dedication to Pan and the Nymphs from a cave on Mount Parnassos, inscriptions from the oracular sanctuary of Apollo at Abai and from two sanctuaries of Artemis at Antikyra. Scholars working on Roman Phokis will welcome the publication of several new inscriptions, particularly a document from Elateia mentioning an Aetolarch, an honorific inscription from Antikyra, which provides the first occurrence in central Greece for a dekaprotos, and, from Ambryssos, a statue base commemorating the emperor Gallienus. Remarkably, the texts of two recently published inscriptions from Panopeus/Phanoteus in Phokis and Opous, in eastern Lokris, had long been known to 1 This article is meant as a follow-up to last year's piece in this journal, devoted to the epigraphy of the region of Boeotia (Marchand 2014).

Research in eastern Lokris will now be greatly facilitated by the recent publication of IGIX 12, 5 by Daniela Summa. A bronze pedimental stele, which preserves the text of a letter from the emperor Hadrian to the people of Naryka, is one of the most outstanding finds from central Greece in the last decade. Euboea Following a rescue excavation, the site of the oracle of Apollo Selinountios (Str. 10.1.3), or rather, as revealed by new epigraphic evidence, Apollo Selinaios, was identified in 2001 at the foot of Mount Telethrion, in the vicinity of modern Rovies, in the territory of ancient Histiaia (ID3432). Besides remains of walls and Hellenistic pottery, the site has yielded two inscriptions. The first is a broken stele of white marble, dating to the Late Hellenistic period. It records the very first manumission act ever found in Euboea, with the dedication of a female slave to Apollo Selinaios. A college of astynomoi is also mentioned in the document (SEG LVI 1030). The other inscription is a fragmentary list of names dating to the first half of the fourth century BC (SEG LVI 1029). Another sanctuary - presumably of Herakles - located in the area of Neos Pyrgos has yielded an over-lifesize statue group from the first half of the sixth century BC, featuring Herakles and the Nemean lion, with a dedication by a man called Kylion engraved on the left side of the beast (SEG LIX 1009). Excavations carried out in 2004 in the eastern cemetery of Chalcis brought to light a fourth-century BC boundary stone reading Όρος ίεροΰ (SEG LIX 976; ID3445), reused in the wall of a later tomb. Additional boundary stones, also dating to the fourth century BC and bearing identical inscriptions, were uncovered near the acropolis (SEG LIX 977-78). Among the Hellenistic tombstones found in the eastern cemetery of Chalcis (ID3445), two belong to foreigners, a man from Arbela in Syria (SEG LIX 980) and another from Zone in Thrace (SEG LIX 981 ; see also BE 2014: no. 243, where Denis Knoepfler argues that they belonged to the Antigonid garrison stationed at Chalcis). Further epitaphs from Chalcis include that of the Maiotian Gelon (Hellenistic, SEG LVI 1024), an epitaph from the third or fourth century AD copied by Lolling at Kastella (SEG LVII 824) and an early fourth-century BC tombstone reused in the ancient cemetery at Pedio Volis (SEG LIX 975; ID1026). Two inscribed rings in copper alloy, from the fourth or fifth century AD, were found at Dokos (SEG LV 976-77). Finally, a black dipinto on the neck of an amphoriskos from the Late Hellenistic period (or later) entered the archaeological collection at Chalcis (SEG LIX 983). An exhibition devoted to Eretria was organized in Athens and Basel between 2010 and 2011 as an early celebration of the 50th anniversary of work in Euboea undertaken by the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece. The richly illustrated exhibition catalogue in French, German and Greek, produced for the occa sion, offers photographs of many inscriptions (Martin Pruvot et al. 2010; with SEG LX 961 for a discussion of the inscriptions). Several fragmentary inscriptions associated with the gymnasium of Eretria were discussed in detail in 2009 by Knoepfler, who offers several re-editions of inscriptions with additional restorations, such as one concerning the honorary inscription for Theopompos (SEG LIII 922), dating to ca. 100 BC (SEG LIX 985), a possible Hesiodic monument from the Hellenistic period (SEG LIII 925 with SEG LIX 987), the fragment SEG LIII 924 (SEG LIX 989) and the dedication of a bench by two gymnasiarchs (late second century BC; SEG LIX 988).

A small epigraphical dossier per taining to the tribe Narkittis has now been created thanks to several choregic inscriptions of which two, possibly from the late fourth century BC, were unpub lished (Knoepfler 2010). The first is carved on a marble base for a bronze tripod, found reused in a Hellenistic house (SEG LX 965), while the second is a fragment of a rectangular base found on the acrop olis (SEG LX 966). The other tribe (Admetis) is attested so far in only one document, a subscription dated to the first half of the third century BC involv ing a polemarch. The four joining fragments of the inscription were found in 2011 reused in the caldar ium of the Roman baths (Fig. 87; Knoepfler and Ack- 87.

Besides many demes, two tribes are © Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece. recorded in this document: a tribe Demetrias - whose eponymous is Demetrios Poliorcetes and therefore implies a date after 304 BC - and the completely new tribe, the tribe Admetis, whose eponym, the hero Admetos, was closely linked with Apollo at Tamynai. The original provenance of the stele may be either the sanctuary of Apollo Daphnephoros or the agora. Three important sanctuaries of the Eretriad have yielded varied and significant epigraphical material dated between the eighth century BC and the Late Roman period. Excava tions carried out by the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece in the intra muros Sanctuary of Apollo Daph nephoros have brought to light a series of 64 graffiti and two dipinti on vases and a spindle whorl from archaeologi cal contexts securely dated between the Middle and the Late Geometric periods (ca. 800-700 BC; SEG LV 980). Twenty eight were extracted from pits containing large quantities of pottery and 13 from various fills, while seven were found inside buildings. Out of the 66 graffiti and dipinti, 23 are alphabetic and display the characteristic features of the Euboean alphabet such as the Chalcidian lambda (Fig. 88; SEG LV 980, 31). One remarkable piece features a segment of one of the earliest abecedaria of the Greek world, involv ing a 'window sign' - borrowed from the Phoenicians - pre viously attested only in Etruria (Fig. 89; SEG LV 980, 3).

One graffito is a Semitic inscription dated to ca. 800-750 BC. Excavations carried out in 2006 in a cultic precinct located on the acropolis of Eretria brought to light, in the fill of one of the terraces, an inscribed Cypro-Ionian limestone statuette of a lion (Fig. 90; ID447). The late sixth-century BC retrograde inscription carved on the side of the statuette reads Αθεναίες (SEG LVII 828), and provides additional evidence for the identification of the site as a sanctuary of Athena.

Campaigns involving the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece and the Ephorate of Antiquities of Euboea (fonnerly the 11th EPCA) have been carried out since 2007 on a site east of the modern village of Amarynthos, identified with the elusive Sanctuary of Artemis Amarysia (ID448, ID4225). Excavations have unearthed significant remains of the sanctuary. A poros wall belonging to a fourth-century BC building was excavated in 2007. Among the ca. 100 fragments of marble architectural blocks found in a layer cov ering the wall was an undated inscribed fragment bearing the three letters ΥΝΘ, which suggest a potential connection with the local Artemis έν Αμαρύνθω. Another inscription was discovered in the course of the 2013 campaign in the fill generated by the construction of a stoa. It belongs to the upper-left corner of a statue base, presumably commissioned around 100 BC, by the demos of Eretria for a benefactor (BE 2014: no. 232), and appears to confirm that the precinct was used to exhibit honorific monuments in the Late Hellenistic period. Some letters in epichoric script belonging to personal names - probably names of dedicants - were read on two artefacts: a seventh-century BC bronze wheel (Fig. 91) and an undated sherd of pottery. Some 91.

The corpus of Eretrian funerary inscriptions has also grown considerably. The epitaph of the philoso pher Asklepiades of Plilious (ca. 270 BC) has attracted attention (SE G LV 979, S EG LX 972), as has that of the Neapolitan lyric poet Trebios (ca. 100 BC; SEG LVI1 829). Following torrential rains in September 2009, rescue excavations carried out in the river bed - which was canalized by the Eretrians as early as the seventh century BC - and the western cemeteries uncovered 30 marble stelae dated between the fourth and the third centuries BC, of which 27 are inscribed (Fig. 92; ID 1034). Two additional epitaphs come from known archaeological contexts: the stele for a Timoklea, daughter of Euphiletos (ID3464; SEG LIX 992), dated to the third century AD, was found between the Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros and the West Gate and SEG LIX 996 was discovered northeast of the theatre. Two undated epitaphs were found reused in a modern house (SEG LIX 993-94), while a third was brought to the museum by a shepherd (SEG LIX 995). A tomb has also yielded a painted kalos inscription on the rim of a fragmentary early fifth-century BC black-glazed aryballos (SEG LX 975). A private collection from the islet of Agia Triada was seized in 2003 and transferred to the Museum of Eretria. It includes six tombstones (SEG LIX 1001-06) and a list of citizens providing the names of two Eretrian demes (SEG LIX 991). 68 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 89.

A bronze weight of the fourth century BC decorated with a ram's head and with Απόλλωνος Δηλίδ inscribed on it in pointillé allows the identification of the site with a Sanctuary of Apollo Delios, which played a role in the journey of the Hyperbo raean offerings to Delos (SEG LI 1128, SEG LVI 1042). Additional epigraphic findings include fragments of fourth century BC black-glazed skyphoi with scratched letters IE - for ιερός (SEG LI 1127) - on their base found outside a Classical building (building IV), a fragment of a fifth century BC skyphos with the personal name Lysikleides scratched in the black glaze (Αυσικλέδες; SEG LVI 1041) and various other graffiti on sherds added before or after firing, dated between the seventh and fourth centuries BC (SEG LVIII 963).

An erotic inscription from Styra has recently been republished with a new interpretation of the meaning of the text (SEG LII 819, SEG LVII 833). Several inscriptions have been brought to light in the region of Karystos. Two of them appear to be fragmentary fourth-century BC cult regulations.

New funerary inscriptions from Karystos include SEG LVI 1040 (ca. 300 250 BC) and Christian epitaphs dating to the fourth to sixth century AD (SEG LIX 1007-08). Phokis Scholarship on the epigraphy of Delphi has benefitted since 2012 from a major work offering the texts of over 300 inscriptions from ca. 600 BC to AD 1868 accompanied by very accessible French translations, even to non-native speakers of French (Jacquemin et al. 2012). While it is unfortunate that not a single illustration is provided in the book itself, the gallery of pictures made available on the website of the French School at Athens will delight researchers, students and teachers of epigraphy at all levels (http://www.efa.gr/index.php/fr/publications/demieres-publications/ressources-en-ligne/etudes-epigraphiques 5-galerie-d-images).

What may be a mason's instructions were also found carved in the rock south of the Kastalia fountain (SEG LV 579). A dedication to Demeter and Kore, no doubt associated with the Sanctuary of Demeter at Erochos, has now been transferred to the Museum of Amphissa, after having been stored for decades in a private house. An inscription consisting of the names of three men in the nominative - probably an epitaph - is built into the wall of the same house (SEG LIX 549). In 2011 a small bronze plaque with a dedication by a woman called Aristo to Pan and the Nymphs, inscribed in dots, was discovered in a cult cave on Mount Parnassos. Further archaeological remains from the cave include terracotta figurines and pots dated between the end of the sixth and the fourth cen turies BC (Rousset 2012: 1679-80; Katsarou 2013). Four manumission records dating to the reign of Trajan were found at Tithorea, engraved on two orthostats that may originally have supported offering tables but were eventually reused in a fifth-century AD basilica. These sacral manumissions describe the sale of slaves to the Sarapis of Tithorea and follow similar processes to those in use at Delphi {BE 2013: no. 210). A white marble milestone erected in the reign of the emperor Probus (AD 276-282), but found in the Church of Ioannis Theologos, offers a very rare glimpse of third-century AD Phokian epigraphy (Rousset 2012: 1682-84, no. 6). At Elateia, an Attic red-figure cup by the Pithos Painter (510-500 BC), inscribed with an erotic pen tameter verse in Phokian epichoric script, was found in 2004 in a tomb (BE 2013: no. 212). Two inscrip tions dating from the Imperial period are published in a recent monograph dedicated to Hellenistic and Roman Elateia (Zachos 2013: pi. 68; BE 2014: no. 248). The first consists of another metric inscription, a distich in honour of a priest of Pallas. The Aetolarch ([Α]ίτωλάρχη—) mentioned in the other will no doubt feed discussions on the history of the Aetolian koinon and of Aetolian institutions in the Imperial period. In the same monograph, the material of a local lamp workshop is also published. Some readings of new stamps (personal names), all dated between the second and third centuries AD, are provided. The DAI has been carrying out excavations at the Sanctuary of Apollo at Abai (modern Kalapodi) since 2005. A new piece of evidence for the identification of the site with the oracular sanctuary came to light in 2007 during the cleaning of the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin, west of the village, where a fragmentary statue base erected by the polis of Abai for the emperor Constantine was brought to light (ID435). A fragmentary dedication scratched on a vase after firing, dated ca. 480^60, was also found at the sanctuary (SEG LIX 551). Three unpublished rock-cut inscriptions were found at Panopeus/Phanoteus in 1993 and 1998, between the upper city and the acropolis, near an opening in the fortification (Rousset et al. 2015). Two of them date to the Archaic period and may be part of an open-air sanctuary of the eponymous hero Phanotos. The first, from the late sixth century BC, describes a series of gifts by Phanotos to his daughter Boupyga in the form of animal parts, sacrificed to Athena Pronaia and Apollo Lykios. The text itself had been long known from a later copy displayed at Delphi, the well-known cippus of the Labyadai (CID I 9; Jacquemin et al. 2012: no. 30). The second inscription also belongs to the Archaic period, and records the incomplete dedication of a shield by the Phanoteans to Phanoteus. The third inscription is a Hellenistic dedication to Dionysos. As for recent epigraphic discoveries pertaining to Ambryssos, a new dedication to Artemis and Prometheus dating to the third century BC has been deciphered on the base of a small column reused in the Church of Agios Panteleimon and Agia Paraskevi near Distomo (SEG LV 581). Knowledge of the Imperial epigraphy of Ambryssos has been enhanced thanks to a fragment of a statue base, found reused in a building near an early basilica at Distomo in 2002, bearing an honorary inscription for the emperor Gallienus dated to ca. AD 267. An undated base for a votive offering preserves four letters (SEG LIX 533). Eleven epitaphs have also been documented (SEG LIX 534-42). Several inscriptions associated with two local sanctuaries of Artemis at Antikyra, Artemis Diktynna and Artemis Eileithyia, have been published recently. For the former, a family monument from the second century AD, according to the editio princeps, set up in honour of two women, of which one was a former priestess of Artemis Diktynna, was found in the Early Christian basilica of Antikyra in 1980, but was only 70 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="71">Recent epigraphic research in central Greece: Euboea, Phokis &amp; Lokris published in 2014 in a monograph devoted to Antikyra (Sideris 2014: 122-24). Two new dedica tions to Artemis Eileithyia have also been brought to light. One is a fragmentary base from the third or second century BC found at Antikyra (Sideris 2014: 125) and the other is an undated rock-cut inscription from the area of the Temple of Artemis (Fig. 94; SEG LV 583). Further rupestral inscriptions were discov ered in the same area, such as a heavily damaged text spread over two columns, whose purpose remains unclear. A personal name in the genitive and epithets of Artemis have been offered in the editio princeps (SEG LV 584). Although equally ravaged, another undated rock-cut inscription offers enough readable text to identify a manumission record (SEG LV 582). Regarding institutions at Antikyra, a third-century AD honorific inscription on a limestone statue base found in 1980 in the course of the rescue excavation of an Early Christian basilica largely built from spolia, records over 16 lines the career of a local man and offers the first piece of evidence in central Greece for a dekaprotos, a magistracy so far primarily attested in Asia Minor (BE 2014: no. 249; Rousset 2012: 1673— 74). Among other spolia from the basilica of interest 94.

Only one of them has been published so far: a statue base from the late second to early third century AD for a M. Ulpius Xenagoras, erected by his father (Sideris 2014: 136, n.262). New funerary material from Antikyra includes two undated epitaphs {SEG LIX 543-44) for which the archaeological context is not known. On the other hand, a third-century AD defixio, written on a lead tablet, was found in the course of excavations in a cemetery in 2001. Finally, a funerary stele with a Thracian rider in relief, bearing a Late Roman inscription celebrating a heroized deceased man, was found south of the acropolis of Boulis, and has now entered the archaeological col lection of Distomo (Fig. 95; SEG LIX 545). Eastern Lokris Scholars working on eastern Lokris will be delighted by the richly illus trated recent volume in the Inscriptiones Graecae series by Daniela Summa (IG IX l2, 5: Inscriptiones Locridis Orientalis) published in 2011 and collating 268 entries, of which some inedita are discussed below (BE 2012: nos 209, 245).

One of the most remarkable new epigraphic documents for eastern Lokris - and probably for central Greece - originates from the small city of Naryka and dates to the very end of Hadrian's reign (IG IX l2, 5 2018; SEG LVI 565). The monument consists of the upper part of a cast bronze pedimental stele whose original height exceeded lm. The ductus of the letters shows that the text was inscribed on wax before the monument was cast, and the bust of a bearded emperor was inserted into the pediment at some point in modern times. In his letter, which can be assigned to a date between January and July AD 138, Hadrian confirms to the people of Naryka that their city had achieved the status of polis. The text lists the reasons behind his deci sion - no doubt provided by the people of Naryka themselves in their plea to the emperor - such as the involvement of Naryka in the Amphictyony, the Boeotian koinon and the Panhellenion, and references to local institutions and heroes, as well as to Naryka in the work of Greek and Latin poets. It has important con sequences for many aspects of our knowledge of second-century AD central Greece, including political insti tutions (see, for example, SEG LVI 504 for the implications of this document regarding the Boeotian koinon). The stele may have stood at Naryka next to the statue of an emperor - probably Hadrian himself (SEG III 425). Indeed, an inscribed statue base naming the emperor was found in a building identified as the Sebasteion. One new manumission record from eastern Lokris has recently been published. It was found at Anavra and records the dedication of a female slave to Sarapis in the second century BC (IG IX l2, 5 2030). At Agia Aikaterini (Alope?) a fragmentary list of 50 male names - perhaps a casualty list or a military catalogue - engraved in Lokrian epichoric script on three faces of a limestone pillar dateable to the first quarter of the fifth century BC was uncovered in the course of excavations (SEG LVI 563; IG IX l2, 5 2002). Three graffiti and a dipinto from the late sixth to early fifth century BC were found during the same campaign, within a pithos tomb (SEG LVI 564; IG IX l2, 5 2014-16). At Opous (modern Atalanti), a mid fourth-century statue base dedicated to Zeus Patroos and Athena was found in an Early Christian basilica, where it was used as building material (IG IX l2, 5 1926). The facsimile by Klaffenbach of a now lost Amphiktyonic decree dated ca. 117 BC from Opous has also recently been published (IG IX l2, 5 1921). It is a copy of a well-known inscription from Delphi, belonging to the dossier related to wrongdoing in the administration of Apollo's properties (CID IV 119 H); the readings of lines 60-81 can now been improved (SEG LIX 543). The section dedicated to Opous in the new IG volume also reveals the upper part of a new ephebic list from the second century AD (IG IX l2, 5 1925). Excavation of the Asklepieion of Daphnous at Agios Konstantinos in 2007 (BE 2014: no. 252) revealed several buildings, as well as an altar, an eschara and several pits. These contexts yielded material that allows the period of use of the sanctuary to be placed between the end of the sixth century BC and ca. 100 BC, when the temple was destroyed. Several graffiti on vases were retrieved, including a sherd with the four letters ΑΣΚΛ- (SEG LVIII 506) and another with -ΚΑΗΠΙΩ. Along with bronze snakes also discov ered in the course of the same excavation, these confirm the identification of the site with an Asklepieion (Papakonstantinou 2012: figs 6β, 6γ, 7α, 7β; cf. IG IX l2, 5 2017). Several cities have yielded funerary material. At Halai, for example, a retrograde epitaph from the second half of the sixth century BC was discovered (SEG LVIII 507; IG IX l2, 5 1873). Western Lokris At Amphissa, a Hellenistic inscription warns of 'immovability', either of a tombstone or of someone's property (SEG LVI 566). Nineteen tombstones from excavations carried out at Amphissa were published in 2011 (Rousset and Kolonia 2011; cf. BE 2012: no. 246). One of them, dating perhaps to the sixth century 72 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 96.

An epigram was engraved on a funerary monument from a polyandrion dated to the third century BC. Among the possible historical contexts for such a monument, the editio princeps shows a preference for the Galatian invasions of 279 BC (Rousset and Kolonia 2011: no. 6). Three additional tombstones dated between the fifth century BC and the Imperial period, originating from Myania, are now kept at the Museum of Amphissa (Rousset and Kolonia 2011 : no. 20-22). Work at the Church of Agios Ioannis at Malandrino allowed several blocks bearing nine new manu missions records from Physkeis to be extracted (Fig. 97; SEG LVI 570-78). The documents all date to the mid second century BC, except for SEG LVI 575 which appears to be a couple of decades earlier. The records describe either a sacral manumission (fictive sale) to Athena Ilias, in whose sanctuary the docu ments were originally displayed, or the dedication of the slave to the goddess. A Hellenistic dedication to Zeus Agoraios and other gods, of unknown provenance (perhaps Physkeis), was copied by Paul Jamot in 1888, but published only recently (SEG LVI 579). Finally, at Naupaktos a Christian inscription from the fifth century AD - a signature of a presbyteros - can be read in a mosaic decorating the pavement of a building which may have served a religious function.

Thasos (Map 7) In 2011 the École française d'Athènes celebrated the centenary of its activities on Thasos (Muller and Mulliez 2012). Apart from the publication of a modern Greek translation of the second edition of the Guide de Thasos (Grandjean and Salviat 2000; 2012), the centenary was the occasion for the publication of a number of thematic studies, based on past archaeological research (Muller 2011; Picard 2011; Marc doi: 10.1017/S0570608415000095 Archaeological Reports 61 (2014-2015)75-93</page><page sequence="76">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 Map 7. Locations in Thasos referred to in the text. © BSA. 1. Proto-Byzantine villa (DOM 5); 2. Passage of the Theoroi; 3. western outer sector of the agora; 4. towards Molos. 2012). More generally, current research on Thasos focuses on all aspects of archaeology, including exca vation and field survey (mainly within the ancient urban area), as well as study of archaeological material kept in the museum's collections. This work benefits from the unfailing support of the Ephoreia of Antiq uities in Kavala. During the last decade (2005-2015), there have been many new discoveries and publications in the field of Thasian epigraphy. This material continues to be enriched in different ways. Several of the docu ments discovered in past excavations have now been published, particularly those found in the 'Abords Nord-Ouest' (= western outer sector) of the agora during the 1970s (Fournier 2006; Grandjean 2012 2013; Hamon forthcoming; Trippé forthcoming). At present, the main excavations in progress are in a Proto-Byzantine villa (DOM 5) located north of the Artemision (Kokkinos plot: Grandjean and Salviat 2000: 51). As in the case of most Late Antique structures, significant numbers of stones (both inscribed and uninscribed) originating from the agora and from adjacent shrines have been reused in its walls (Foumier 2006; Fournier and Prêtre 2006; Fournier and Hamon 2007). New inscriptions have also been revealed during systematic investigation of the fortification walls (Grandjean 2011). In addition, two basil icas located to the west of the city (at Agios Vassileios) have been the object of a recent campaign of exca vation by the Ephoreia, and have yielded a number of inscriptions originally from the necropolis (Fournier and Dadaki 2012-2013). Within the confines of the ancient necropolis, which lies buried under the modern town of Limenas, the Ephoreia frequently conducts rescue excavations, in the process of which funerary stelae and sarcophagi are unearthed. Finally, beginning in 2007, the EfA, in collaboration with the Kavala Ephoreia, has undertaken the pub lication of a new corpus of inscriptions of Thasos, intended to replace IG XII 8 (nos 261-630), IG XII Suppl. (nos 347-515), Pouilloux 1954, and Dunant and Pouilloux 1958. The new corpus will be arranged 76 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="77">Recent epigraphic research in Thasos, Aegean Thrace &amp; Samothrace (2005-2015) by periods and by main types of documents (see Fournier and Hamon 2006; Fournier et al. 2011). The volumes dedicated to public documents of the Late Classical and Hellenistic periods (CITh III), and of the Imperial period (CITh V) will be published first, to be followed by that dedicated to the lists of magistrates (CITh I) and another to documents of the Archaic period and the fifth century BC (CITh II). The preparatory work for this project involves the systematic collation of texts directly from the stones, as well as the cre ation of new photographic records. This preliminary work has allowed for the reinterpretation of already published but ill-understood inscriptions (Hamon 2008; 2009; 2010; Fournier and Dadaki 2012-2013). The epigraphic harvest of the last decade reflects the originality and typological variety of Thasian inscriptions (Osborne 2009; Fournier et al. 2011). It also testifies to the remarkable continuity of the epi graphic habit in this city from the Archaic period until Late Imperial times. Among the new finds, the oldest inscriptions are the quarry marks inscribed on the fortification walls, in the Parian and Ionian alphabets. These are either personal names, usually in abbreviated form, or symbols associated with the process of stone extraction or building. A large number of these marks date from the time when the fortification circuit was constructed, at the very beginning of the fifth century BC. Others belong to the later phases of its refurbishment. Some of these masons' marks had already been noted. In his definitive study of the circuit wall, Yves Grandjean (2011: 595-615, with illustrations) lists 549 entries, of which more than 300 are new. The only other new document dating to the beginning of the Classical period has a private character. It is a fragment of a letter, inscribed on a potsherd and dated, on palaeographic and dialectal criteria, to the second half of the fifth century BC (Trippé forthcoming). This document was found in a domestic context and mentions the cult of Zeus Patroos. Its interpretation is fraught with difficulty. Among the Classical and Hellenistic inscriptions, one that deserves mention is the boundary-stone (horns) of a patrë, that of the Menoitiadai (Fig. 98; Grandjean 2012-2013: no. 10). The patrai were the subdivisions of the civic body of Thasos; this one is the eighth or ninth known to date. Three Thasian decrees, complete and fragmentary, have been recov ered. The first two refer to the maintenance of order in the Sanctuary of Delian Artemis (Grandjean and Salviat 2006 = SEG LVI 1017). The third is a frag ment constituting the lower part of the 'Stele of the Agathof, the upper part of which has been known since 1954. This stele contains a highly original reg- 98.

It is worth mentioning that the only Thasian decree found outside the city was published in 1999. It dates to the third century BC and honours judges from Cos, where the stone was inscribed (Crowther 1999: no. 3 = SEG XLIX 1108; IG XII4, 136). The decree published by Christiane Dunant and Jean Pouilloux (1958: no. 166), which honours a historian-performer, found on Thasos itself and dated to the Late Hellenistic period, had been interpreted by the editors as ema nating from the Thasian authorities. A revision has shown, however, that the document originated in a foreign city (perhaps Paros) and that the honorand was a Thasian (Hamon 2008). Thasian civic life in the Classical and Hellenistic periods is also reflected in a multitude of lists and ded ications set up by magistrates, mainly in the fourth and third centuries BC. Among the new documents that can be added to those already known are the following: a list of all the magistrates in office in a single year (Grandjean 2012-2013: no. 5); a dedication by the board of apologoi (Grandjean 2012-2013: no. 6); another by the gynaikonomoi (Grandjean 2012-2013: no. 7); and six inscriptions of a votive and/or commemorative character, set up by boards of theoroi (Fig. 99; Grandjean 2012-2013: nos 2- 4).

Publication of the fortification circuit has made it possible to discover a fragmentary building contract inscribed at the end of the fourth century BC (Grand jean 2011: 590—94, no. 12). It concerns either the tower or the main building adjoining the Maritime Gate. An altar dedicated to 'King Philip Sôtër' clearly dates to the end of the fourth century BC and must therefore refer to the cult of Philip II (Hamon forth coming). Finally, excavations in the agora, as well as houses and burials, have since the 1920s yielded examples of bronze plaques bearing personal names, inscribed or reinscribed with a sharp chisel (Fig. 100). Grandjean (2010) has assembled a corpus of a dozen or so of these, many hitherto unpublished (SEG LX 99. Thasos: three boards o/theoroi, second half of the 946-57). Such pinakia can be dated, on letter forms, second century BC. © EfA and P. Collet. to the fourth or third century BC. Inscriptions of the Roman period are also well represented, and in considerable variety. A damaged decree, which dates to the end of the first century BC or the beginning of the first century AD, was discov ered in 2004. It honours a citizen called Stilbon and his unnamed wife, a priestess. The couple undertook all the expenses for construction or repairs in the sanc 100.

BE 2009: 412). A decree ratifying the will and testa ment of Rebilus (Dunant and Pouilloux 1958: no.185) can now be dated quite precisely to the year AD 22, thanks to the clarification of the consular year preserved in lines 37-38 (Fournier forthcoming). The consul whose name is preserved should be identified as C. Sulpicius Galba, who was the eponymous magistrate in Rome in 22 alongside D. Haterius Agrippa. In consequence, a fragmentary decree from Serres can be dated to the same period, if not the same year, since it honours the same individual, whose full name was M. Varinus Rebilus (Nigdelis 2009). As a result, we can now better place the activities of this man, who belonged to an important Roman family settled in Macedonia, and who, importantly, donated agricultural land to the city of Thasos. One recent addition to the many dozens of honorific public inscriptions known so far, dating mainly to the Imperial period, is one in honour of Agrippa Postumus, composed of two fragments, one of which was discovered in 1983 and the other in 2004 (Fournier 2006 = SEG LVI 1019). This ephemeral heir of the Roman empire, between his adoption in AD 4 and his relegation in AD 6, was endowed with titles such as 'son of the divine Augustus' and 'euergetes by ancestral 101.

Other texts of this type, previously published, have been more fully restored or enhanced by new commentaries. Polyxenë, daughter and wife of notables of the Augustan period, honoured with a statue voted for by the People (Fig. 101; Dunant and Pouilloux 1958: no. 237) reappears in a funerary epigram attributed to the poet Hekataios of Thasos (Anth. Pal. 7.167). From it we learn that the newly married young woman died in childbirth at the age of 18 (Hamon 2009). An inscription found in the 1960s in the region of Abdera (SEG XXVII 338) has been united with a fragment copied on Thasos at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries (IG XII 8, 386). The match between the two fragments (Parissaki 2002 = SEG LII 815) has been confirmed following consultation of the squeeze of the Thasian fragment in the archives of the EfA. As a result, it has become clear that Perigenis, a woman honoured in the first fragment, was the wife of Samos, honoured in the second (Fournier and Dadaki 2012-2013). The reconstituted inscription (Fig. 102) probably dates to the beginning of the second century AD. 102.

Two new dedications concerning the Roman Imperial cult have been published. The older concerns a priestess of Livia called Komis (SEG LVI 1020). Dedicated to Diua Iulia Augusta and the Imperial family, it was definitely inscribed after the death of Augustus and the adoption of Livia into the gens Iulia, but still during the empress' lifetime. Livia thus received divine honours on Thasos before her death in AD 29 and also before her official apotheosis in Rome in AD 42, in the reign of Claudius. The other dedication, found in the same area in 1971, was consecrated to Olympian Hadrian, saviour and founder, and to his wife Sabina (Grandjean 2012-2013: no. 9). This new text joins two other dedications and an honorific inscription dedicated to the same emperor. Most of the funerary inscriptions discovered on Thasos in the course of the last decade come from rescue excavations conducted by the Ephoreia in the area of the necropolis. Dating mostly to the Roman period, these documents belong to many different types; there are simple, inscribed stelae (.ADelt 60 [2005] B2: 844, fig. 17), reliefs decorated with figures (ADelt 60 [2005] B2: 844, fig. 18) and family sarcophagi (ADelt 56-59 [2001-2004] B3b: 631). Two epitaphs, discovered some time ago, have now been published. The first, consisting of two names and an epigram, is inscribed on a sarcophagus discovered at Molos (Grandjean 2012-2013: no. 12). It tells of Pankratides and his son Euphrillos, also called Theodoros or Theodas; the former is qualified as 'father of the city', a title conferred a number of times to Thasian nota bles in the Imperial period. The second is also known as archon (IG XII 8, 471 B, 11. 16-19) and high priest of the Imperial cult (BCH 86 [1962] 596 no. 16). Both men appear to have lived during the first half of the second century AD. The second epitaph is inscribed on a large marble block from a funerary mon ument, reused in Proto-Byzantine times and discovered at Agios Vassileios. This monument, dated to the first century AD, bore the names of five Thasians - three men and two women - belonging to three gen erations (Fournier and Dadaki 2012-2013). It is worth mentioning here the stimulating study by Bernard Holtzmann (2012) of one particular type of Thasian monument characteristic of the imperial period - funerary medallions, sometimes inscribed, representing a couple or, more frequently, a woman by herself.

Civic spaces are regularly referred to in Thasian inscriptions (Graham 2000; Grandjean and Salviat 2000). Some are well known and have been well explored archaeologically. Others are still difficult to identify topographically, although newly discovered documents may contribute to greater precision. The Stele of the Agathoi was erected, as the fragment published in 2007 tells us, in front of the prytaneion: this should probably be located on the northeastern side of the agora, and, perhaps more precisely, in the complex near the bouleuterion (Grandjean and Salviat 2000: no. 14; Fournier and Hamon 2007: 343-44; Marc 2012: 14-15). Another important site of civic life, the office of the polemarchoi, has possibly been located in the building alongside the Maritime Gate (Grandjean 2014). Understanding of the religious topography of the city has also benefitted from new inscriptions. The decree honouring Stilbon was prob ably once displayed in the Artemision, the main female sanctuary (Grandjean and Salviat 2000: 52-55). It was found, reused nearby, in the villa DOM 5; the benefactor had undertaken to keep the sanctuary of the goddess in good order (Fournier and Prêtre 2006). His building activities seem to be contemporary with those of Epié, who was also responsible for construction work at the Artemision (SEG XVIII 343). The most important discovery of the last decade has been another sanctuary mainly dedicated to a female divinity, namely the Delion, situated north of the ancient city, against the circuit wall (Grandjean and Salviat 2012: 134). It has been identified thanks to an inscription on the entrance porch (Grandjean and Salviat 2006). Subsequent review has allowed us to recognize that this sanctuary was mentioned by Hip pocrates in a poorly transmitted passage of the Epidemics (Grandjean and Salviat 2012-2013). The same inscription from the Delion confirms that the sanctuary located close by, on the promontory of Evraiokas tro, is indeed the Thesmophorion (Grandjean and Salviat 2000: 61). In general, the inscriptions only tell us very occasionally about political and military events. There are few novelties here, and these aspects of Thasian history remain poorly understood after ca. 400 BC. The republication of the completed Stele of the Agathoi, which dates to the middle of the fourth century BC, has led to a review of the context in which such exceptional measures as the organization of public funerals and the award of pensions and grants to war-orphans could have been undertaken. The document implies a military call-up on an exceptional scale, even including non-citizens. One plausible, if uncon firmed, hypothesis is that it is connected with the Thasian presence in the Peraia, which faced various threats in the 350s BC, the most significant of which being the expansion of Macedonia (Fournier and Hamon 2007; Picard 2011). Thasian allegiance to Macedonia after the Battle of Chaeronea is reflected in the existence of a cult of Philip II at the end of the fourth century BC (Hamon forthcoming). It has been suggested that the grant of Thasian politeia to one Polyaretos of Zone, proxenos of the Thasians, and to several members of his family, might be linked to the disruption caused, in Macedonia and Thrace, by the Galatian invasion of ca. 279 BC (1G XII 8, 267, interpretation of Psoma 2008). But the chronology of the Thasian archons and theoroi suggests an earlier date for the decree, towards 290 BC (Grandjean et al. 2004-2005: 254-56; BE 2009: 411). No Thasian document specifically allows us to follow the course of Thasian history during the third century, when the island was under Antigonid hegemony. It is instead the continuity of institutional life in the city on which the recently discovered inscriptions throw new light. The regulations in the Stele of the Agathoi thus reveal that, in the fourth century BC, the Thasian assembly was presided over by prytaneis, hitherto unknown as a body but very likely composed, as in Athens, of a rotating committee of bouleutai (Fournier and Hamon 2007: 348-52). The content of the regulations, particularly the newly published clauses referring to the maintenance (trophe) of war orphans, suggests, in addition, the influence of Athenian practice, of which there are other traces on Thasos in the fourth century BC, not just in the institutional sphere, but also in that of the arts (Holtzmann 2005). It is no less interesting to note that the patriotic measures taken in honour of the Agathoi and in favour of their heirs were adopted on the proposal of the polemarchs, who clearly played an important role in civic life (Hamon 2010). This was but one among some 15 boards that existed on Thasos. The list published by Grandjean (2012-2013: no. 5) shows in addition that the number of magistrates from all boards taken 80 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="81">Recent epigraphic research in Thasos, Aegean Thrace &amp; Samothrace (2005-2015) together had reached an annual total of about 50 by the end of the fourth century BC. Ordinary Thasian citizens, on the other hand, must have participated in the city's institutions in different ways. The bronze tesserae collected by Grandjean (2010), which date to the fourth and third centuries BC, must have been used to select by lot members of juries or certain magistrates. The functioning of the judicial system can be discerned through the penalty clauses within certain regulations (Fournier 2012). The decree published by Charles Crowther (1999: no. 3 = SEG XLIX 1108) has shown that the functioning of civic jury-courts in Thasos faced a number of difficulties during the third century BC, in common with many other Greek cities at the time. The Thasians had recourse at least once to foreign judges, who came from Cos. The liberation of Thasos by the Romans in 196 BC marks a turning point in the city's history. Relations between Thasos and the Roman authorities have recently been re-examined, particularly with regard to the date of the letter of the Rhodians in honour of a Thasian, Dionysiodoros, one of whose achievements was to have successfully introduced Rhodian ambassadors to the proconsul of Macedonia, L. Aurelius (Dunant and Pouilloux 1958: no. 172). The identity of this L. Aurelius and the date of his appointment have been contentious. In 2010, Bernd Kreiler proposed that he should be identified with L. Aurelius Cotta, who had held the proconsulship between a praetorship in 122 BC and a consulship in 119 (cf. BE 2011: 479), but the year of the eponymous Rhodian priest Thersandros led Nathan Badoud (2015: 173-74) to favour instead L. Aurelius Orestes, consul in 126 BC. Orestes would have held this office following a prae torship, held in 129 at the latest. The document illustrates the very close relations that existed in the second century BC between the city of Thasos and the governors of Macedonia, whose authority extended over the whole region for almost two centuries. Thasos represented at this time a significant power within the region. Financial and military support to Rome allowed the island to preserve, and even to extend, its exter nal possessions. From the principate of Claudius onwards, Thasos was included geographically in the new province of Thrace but remained, in juridical terms, a free city, though concentrating its efforts on defending its privileges against repeated attempts by provincial governors to curtail them (Fournier 2013). The publication, or revision, of many inscriptions from the Julio-Claudian period, offers a more precise picture of the organization and topography of the Imperial cult in the first decades of the Principate (Fournier et al. 2011: 213-14). The honorific inscription for Agrippa Postumus completes a series of statue bases which already included the monuments erected on the agora, or within its confines, dedicated to members of the Imperial family: Livia, Julia the Elder, Julia the Younger and Lucius Caesar (Fournier 2006: 514-17). The last was honoured with a posthumous cult, associated with an altar set up in the agora. The epithet 'son of the divine Augustus' accorded to Agrippa Postumus, between AD 4 and 6, as well as the date, AD 22, of the decree ratifying the will and testament of Rebilus, which mentions the temples of the Augusti (ναοί των Σεβαστών), show that both Augustus and Livia were given divine honours at Thasos during their lifetime, even though the locations of these 'temples' remain unknown (Fournier forthcoming). The early date of these cults is confirmed by the consecration by Komis, priestess of Livia, of an exedra backing on to the rear wall of the northwestern portico and surrounded by a peristyle court (Grandjean and Salviat 2000: 6). This monument was undoubtedly surmounted by statues representing members of the Imperial family (Fournier 2006: 508-13). Discoveries in the field of Thasian onomastics have revealed names hitherto unknown not just on Thasos but more widely in the Greek world, for example Παισιθεμίδης and Βίατος (Grandjean 2012— 2013: no. 5; see also Trippé forthcoming). There are also rare names, such as Βοστδς (Matthaiou 2013), Μελανωπίδης or Έλεφών (Grandjean 2010: nos 6, 10 = SEG LX 951, 955). The very useful compilation of Thasian names contained in volume 1 of the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (Fraser and Mat thews 1987) will need to be updated in the future. Our understanding of local prosopography has also been gradually enriched. Thasos has an exceptional documentary source in the monumental lists of magistrates inscribed in the agora, in which the annual boards of archons and theoroi were recorded from the Archaic period onwards. These lists, fragments of which have been published in IG XII8 and in Jean Pouilloux's (1954) Recherches, have until now received only a partial and provisional publication because the work required to classify the fragments is excep tionally complex and needs to be accompanied by an architectural study of the structures on which the Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 81</page><page sequence="82">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 l ΜΑ Ν s li' A ο ίΛΥΔο Y APHlQ°&lt;AFi&lt;T° °Y ΒογΛΑ&lt;ΤΙΔΑ^ΑΑΙ ροΑΥ Κ PATH £ €.1 — — ι !·&gt; ο Φ Α Ν Τ ο ' is; ο 0&lt; V ' Α ο Ρ ] ΛΑ ο Α ■ "Α ® Οι Τ ο γ / ΝΑϊίΔΛΡΟΤΑΗ ΑΡΗ I s: Κ ο &lt; &lt; Κ τ a " ο PAC ΥΑΑΚ Κ &lt;Β 1 Ν Τ/Λ φ I 1/ΛΑΑ1Λ _Μ_ΕΝ ΕΔΗΑΟί,ΕΕΙ!

A recent article by Theodora Jim (2014) is not, unfortunately, helpful. Patrice Hamon (forthcoming) provides an initial presentation of the dossier as a whole sequence, supported by schemata and announces the preparation of a volume specifically dedicated to this material (CITh I). The dossier will comprise (1) two primary, or 'small' lists (of archons and theoroi), inscribed in the 360s (Fig. 103) and (2) two other, 'great' lists (of archons and theoroi) inscribed in the 320s and added to in the Hellenistic and Imperial periods. The 'Passage des théores' ('Passage of the Theoroi'; Grandjean and Salviat 2000: 46), on which the 'Great List' was inscribed, is also currently the object of an architectural study by Michèle Brunet and Nicolas Bresch. These vertigi 103. Thasos: fragment of the 'small'list of archons, ca. 360 nous catalogues of names constitute a veritable mine BC (Pouilloux 1954: no. 39). © EfA and M.

In addition, amphora stamps, those of the older series as well as the more recent series, also provide names of individuals, both magistrates and manufacturers (or fabricants), who belonged to the same milieu of civic leaders. Progress achieved in classifying the more recent series of stamps in particular contributes to prosopographical work (Garlan 2004-2005; Debidour 2011). The publication of the new corpus of inscriptions will lead to the compilation of a general prosopography of Thasians, a work currently only in its initial phase. Several of the inscriptions discovered in recent years refer to names already known from other docu ments. They enable us to refine the chronological classification of several fragments of lists of magistrates and show up individual elite members and elite family groups of the Hellenistic and Imperial periods. The decrees published in Grandjean and Salviat 2006 and Fournier and Hamon 2007 have thus provided three new names of archons of the fourth century BC (Sômbrotos, Pantaklës and Biôn), who are difficult to place with any precision in the lacunae of the archon lists. The dedications published by Grandjean (2012 2013: nos 5, 7), on the other hand, make known the names of individuals who appear in the lists of the third century BC. It can be pointed out, for instance, that a bronze plaque (Grandjean 2010: no. 10 = SEG LX 955), dated approximately to the second half of the fourth century, belongs to a certain Έλεφών Ήρ[α]κλείδο[υ]. Given the rarity of the name Έλεφών, this individual must be related to a theoros named [Ήρακ]λείδης Έλε[φ]ώνο[ς], of indeterminate date (IG XII 8, 338,1. 6). At the beginning of the Imperial period, a certain Stilbôn was honoured by the city for his benefactions (Fournier and Prêtre 2006). We do not know his father's name. He may, nevertheless, have been the father of the priestess Komis, daughter of Stilbôn, who consecrated an exedra to the family of Livia on the western periphery of the agora (Fournier 2006). She herself was the wife of one Hikesios, son of Aristokles, attested elsewhere as one of the archons in the early Imperial period, and who bore the title φνλόκαισαρ και φιλό πατρις. The poet Hekataios, who wrote the funerary epigram commemorating Polyxenë, may be the same man as C. Iulius Hekataios, twice archon in the same period (Hamon 2009). The inscription from Agios Vassileios enables the identification of a funerary monument commemorating the members of an important Thasian family, active between the first and second centuries AD, in which the names Samos and Herôdes alternated between father and son. Reuniting the monument and the associated epigraphic dossier has allowed for a stemma over five generations to be drawn up, showing connections between some 15 men and women. The importance of this extended family can be measured by the almost systematic access of 82 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 &lt;.£ ! Λ Α Ν ι !i Λ ίΛΥΔο Y APHie°^APKT°. l°Y Β ο ΥΑΑ&lt; Τ !

Finally, the recent publication of a memorial of a Thasian delegation to the Sanctuary of Apollo at Klaros, dated to AD 127/8, has revealed the names of the seven boys who made up the city's choir, as well as those of the four ambassadors who accompanied them (Ferrary 2014: 255-56, no. 30). The names of two of them, Asi atikos son of Satyros and Quintus son of Quintus, also appear in the lists of theoroi inscribed at Thasos (Ασιατικός Σατύρου: IG XII 8, 322, Β, 11. 16-17; Κόϊντος Κοίντου: IG XII 8, 323,11. 1-2). Aegean Thrace The term 'Aegean Thrace' is a modern convention used to define in broad terms the southwestern part of ancient Thrace within the borders of the modern Greek state. It corresponds to the area that extends from the southern ridges of the Rhodope mountains to the Aegean littoral, and from the lower course of the Nestos river to that of the Hebros. Thus defined, the term does not include sites such as Ainos (modern Enez), located east of the Hebros estuary. Excavations in Aegean Thrace during the decade 2005-2015 have been mainly rescue projects, most of them focusing on Maroneia and Abdera, two of the region's most important archaeological sites. Sys tematic excavations were conducted by the local 19th EPCA, the ASCSA and the University of Princeton at the site of Molyvoti (ancient Stryme(?); ID4213; see AR 60 [2013-2014] 102-03) and by the 19th EPCA at the Roman foundation of Plotinopolis (modern Didymoteicho; ID3071; AR 60 [2013-2014] 104). These have yielded only a few epigraphic finds to date. The event that has done most to stimulate epigraphic research in the region has been the publication of the long-overdue Corpus of Inscriptions of Aegean Thrace (IThrAeg; Loukopoulou et al. 2005). The corpus gathers together, with commentaries, the epi graphic material that constitutes one major source for the region's ancient history, data which have grad ually come to light, mainly from the second half of the 19th century up until 2004. The new volume complements the pioneering and still invaluable corpus of Greek inscriptions from Bulgaria (IGBulg) compiled by Georgi Mikhailov (1956-1997). IThrAeg was compiled under the direction of Louisa D. Loukopoulou with the collaboration of Maria Gabriella Parissaki, Selene Psoma and Antigoni Zournatzi (Loukopoulou et al. 2005; for general remarks on the corpus, see also AnnEpigr 2005: 1342; BE 2005: 2; SEG LV 724; and the reviews in Historische Zeitschrift 283 [2006] 444-45 [M. Zahrnt], The Classical Review 56 [2006] 458-59 [P.J. Thonemann] and Gnomon 81 [2009] 321-26 [H.W. Pleket]; the book can be accessed electronically through Helios, the National Hellenic Research Foundation Repository, at http://helios-eie.ekt.gr/EIE/handle/10442/7458). Of the precisely 500 inscriptions included in it, approximately 200 texts are inedita (conveniently gathered at p. 660 of IThrAeg). The lion's share of the documents in the corpus goes to Maroneia (217), followed by Abdera (83), the Thasian peraia1 (61), the Samothracian peraia (33) - 1 from Drys and the rest from Zone - and Doriskos (1), while the cities founded, or refounded, during the great urbanization programme in inland Thrace under the emperor Trajan are more or less equally represented: Topeiros and Traianopolis have yielded 24 each and Plotinopolis has 22 texts. Three more documents can be attributed to the territory of Hadrianopolis, while the origins of 33 remain unknown.2 The overwhelming majority of the documents, moreover, is in Greek, with only nine in Latin (E72, E338^12, E432, E453, E493) and three are bilingual (E313, E337 and E473). 1 For the region east of the river Nestos, this term applies principally to the ancient πόλισμα lying on the Molyvoti peninsula, usually identified with ancient Stryme. This identification has been recently contested, see below. 2 Work done during the compilation of this corpus provided an opportunity to assign to other regions inscriptions that were formerly considered as originating from Aegean Thrace. This is the case for two inscriptions from modern Mandra, a site lying within Abdera's territory, that have been attributed to Thasos (see Parissaki 2002 and above) and also for an inscription first seen in 1882 in the vicinity of Abdera and, in 1937, built into a private house at modern Paradeisos. The latter was originally interpreted as two different inscrip tions to be attributed to Abdera and Topeiros respectively. Maria-Gabriella Parissaki (2011) considers this a pierre errante and assigns it to the territory of Philippi (see also BE 2012: 281; for a different view, written before Parissaki's publication, see Pilhofer 2009: 703d/L914, 703e/L915). Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 83</page><page sequence="84">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 Three further inscriptions (E376, E377 from Maroneia and E427 from Zone) use the Greek alphabet in order to record in written form what seems to be a non-Greek language. Though short, partially preserved and still not fully understood, they are generally considered as offering a reflection of the language used by the indigenous population of Thracian origin. There are three more stone inscriptions that seem to indicate the use of a similar language as well as a number of inscribed sherds (ca. 220), from the Sanctuary of Apollo at Zone, which are to be published by Claude Brixhe. This collection complements a group of inscriptions already known from Samothrace (see below). A provisional presentation of the material from Zone has been offered by Brixhe (Brixhe 2006). Only one group of texts has been set aside for separate publication, namely the topos inscriptions inscribed on the marble seats of the theatre at Maroneia, whose examination is still under way. Among the public documents included in the corpus, the place of honour goes to two newly pub lished inscriptions of Maroneia, the so-called 'eternal decree' and the edict of Hadrian. The first text (IThrAeg Ε180) dates to shortly after the creation of the province of Thrace under Claudius, and stands out, both for its original structure and for the invalu able information it offers on the city's history, notably its resistance to Mithridates' army, and details about its subsequent destruction. Another important reflection of the new realities of the chang ing times is offered by the text's opening clauses, in which the Romans residents at Maroneia are men tioned before the rest of the civic body. The text was first published by Kevin Clinton in 2003 (2003a; see also AnnEpigr 2003: 1559; BE 2004: 249; EBGR 2003: 28; SEG LIII659), with subsequent reflections in 2004 (see also AnnEpigr 2004: 1295). The text was also discussed by Michael Wôrrle in 2004 (see also AnnEpigr 2004: 1296; BE 2005: 382; EBGR 2004: 304; SEG LIII 659); it was further discussed by the same author in 2005 (see also AnnEpigr 2005: 1344) and also by John Thornton in 2007 (see also SEG LVII 617). The edict of Hadrian, first presented in IThrAeg Ε185 (Fig. 104; see also AnnEpigr 2005: 104. Maroneia: edict of Hadrian, upper and lower fragment 1348; SEG LV 744), was subsequently presented by (IThrAeg El85). © National Hellenic Research Foundation. Loukopoulou, Psoma and Sophia Doukata at the Still unpublished III Panhellenic Congress of Epigraphy held at Thessaloniki in 2004 and was also analysed by Christopher Jones in 2011 (see also AnnEpigr 2011: 1156; BE 2012: 289). As well as proposing some new and more plausible restorations, Jones' analy sis highlights the text's importance in fixing more accurately Hadrian's visit to Aegean Thrace in AD 132 and in clarifying the emperor's decisions regarding the practice of vehiculatio. The edict sets out the lawful use of diplomata, by clarifying that those travelling by sea, from Abdera and Maroneia to Samoth race, or by land, from Maroneia to Philippi, would be required to provide payment for boats, rowers and carriages. Among the better known texts from Aegean Thrace, two deserve special consideration. E5, a decree of Abdera for Teian ambassadors, and Ε168, the treaty of alliance between Rome and Maroneia, together constitute the two most frequently discussed inscriptions of Aegean Thrace. The editors of IThrAeg refer to the much debated question of E5's chronology, opting for the 'upper' date of 166-160 BC (see also BE 2006: 256). 84 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 - ί_ · " ι 104.

Although found at Teos, and thus an external testimony, the texts bear witness to the close ties that the metropolis and its apoikia maintained at an institutional level during the first half of the fifth century BC (Loukopoulou and Parissaki 2004). Maria Youni has focused on the legal and polit ical aspects of the text (Youni 2007). A decree for an οικονόμος from the area of Doriskos dates to the second half of the third century BC, and probably relates to the region's control and taxation by the Ptolemies (E451; see also SEG LV 779). Two inscriptions of Traianopolis, dating to the Severan period (E433 and E447), allocate the repairs to be carried out on the region's road network according to phylai. They were briefly commented upon by Ursula Kunnert (2012). Inscriptions constitute a major source of a region's religious life and some of the texts pre sented for the first time in IThrAeg have added greatly to our understanding of the region's principal cults, and their evolution in time (on this topic, see also EBGR 2005: 95 in Kernos 21 [2008]). Special mention should be made of Ε13, dedicated to Hermes Agoraios, and Ε14, to Hestia Pythia, both from Abdera (Fig. 105) and both dating to the second half of the fifth century BC (see also EBGR 2005: 95; SEG LV 730). A group of inscriptions (newly published and long-known) which seems to originate from an unexcavated sanctuary of the Egyptian gods in the Kambana area of ancient Maroneia (in the southeastern sector of the city, 105. Abdera: dedication to Hestia Pythia, late fifth century BC close to the theatre), sheds precious light on (lThrAeg EI4). © National Hellenic Research Foundation. Maroneia's religious life during the Late Hellenistic and Early Roman periods. A long list of votaries' names (E212; cf. AnnEpigr 2005: 1357; SEG LV 745; to which the poorly preserved E213 should be added) gives approximately 65 worshippers from an asso ciation which evolved around the cult of the Egyptian gods. An άρχιερεύς acted as the association's epony mous official, while a θύτης, an ίεροκήρυξ, and an ίερονίκης are mentioned among the members. By mixing together names of Greek, Thracian and Roman origin, the catalogue also reflects the multinational character of Maroneia's society in this transitional period to Roman rule. Already endowed by two long known decrees (El82 and Ε183), our knowledge of this association now makes it the best example of associative life in Aegean Thrace (for an inscription from Abdera, which reveals the existence of an asso ciation devoted to the cult of Dionysos, mentioning an άρχιβουκόλος and his συνμύσται (Ε 18), see Jac cottet (2003) 35 and Kloppenborg and Ascough (2011) 83; also http://philipharland.com/greco-roman-asso ciations/60-dedication-to-the-god-dionysos-and-the-initiates/). A number of dedications by individual worshippers can also be connected to this sanctuary (El99-204). Special mention should also be made here of the well-known Aretalogy of Isis (E205), which has received further comments from Laurent Bricault (2007; see also BE 2008: 346; the text is also to be found in Bricault 2005), Ennio Sanzi (2008; EBGR 2009: 143) and Papanikolaou (2009; BE 2010: 412; EBGR 2009: 119; SEG LIX 737). Dimitros Papanikolaou has focused on the style and language of the text and has highlighted its importance for our knowledge of the oratorical tradition of Hellenistic times. Inscriptions also illuminate religious develop ments during the Imperial period. A group of 11 inscriptions from Maroneia (El 88-198, see also AnnEpigr 2005: 1349-54) reveals that, during the second and third centuries AD, the cult of Zeus and Rome was added to the traditional ones of Dionysos and Maron. Inscription E19 from Abdera is a dedication to Zeus Hypsistos, set up by a woman of Semitic origin named Σαββαϊς (Fig. 106), while E435 reveals the presence of the cult of Asklepios and Hygieia at the newly founded city of Traianopolis. Among funerary inscriptions we may single out the monument of an έταΐρος from Abdera, dated to the middle of the sixth century BC, which presents features of the Paro-Thasian alphabet (E30), the Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 85 105. Abdera: dedication to Hestia Pythia, late fifth century BC (TThrAeg Ε14). © National Hellenic Research Foundation.</page><page sequence="86">106. Abdera: dedication to Zeus Hypsistos, Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 epigram of Apollonios from Babylon (E465), whose presence in the region during the first half of the third century BC may be attributed to the movements of Hellenistic armies, and the funerary monument of Αύρήλιος Κρονίων Έζβένεως του Τήρου (Ε396). Two features of this commemorative slab deserve emphasis: one is his name, which includes the man's papponymic (the name of his grandfather), something very rare in the region, and the other is his position, since the text refers to him as a βουλευτής Μαρωνείτης. Both these fea tures are indications of this native Thracian's social advancement. To be noted also is the presence of a group of inscriptions setting fines for the unauthorized use of a grave (for a well-preserved example of this category, see E219 from Maroneia). This is a formula well attested in Asia Minor during the Imperial period. Nevertheless, the main merit of this group of inscriptions, when viewed as a whole, is its contribution to the onomastic material of the region. In 2007 a separate volume was published on the proso pography and onomasticon of Aegean Thrace as an addendum to the corpus (Parissaki 2007a; see also AnnEpigr 2007: 1248; BE 2008: 126; SEG LVII 606; the review in Revue archéologique 47 [2009] 107-08 [D. Dana]; the book will, in the future, be accessible electronically through Helios at http://hdl.handle.net/10442/13871). fourth centuiy AD (IThrAeg E19) ' 'n addition to the onomastic material offered by the inscriptions, © National Hellenic Research Foundation. this volume also includes an important group of personal names that occurs on coins of Abdera and Maroneia, which probably represents officials responsible for the mints of these two cities, as well as names that occur on inscriptions found outside Aegean Thrace, but pertaining to the region, in literary sources and papyri. Setting aside the pres ence of names that occur for the first time, such as Σχινείση, in an inscription from Zone (E417), the name Σαββαΐς, mentioned above or the much-debated name Βοστάς, the onomastic material offers an interesting insight into the evolution of society in the cities of Aegean Thrace. The few nomina gentilicia attested in the region have formed the subject of a separate analysis by Parissaki, who notes that the presence of a group of non-imperial nomina occurring mainly at Abdera and Maroneia during the Late Hellenistic period should probably be attributed to Romans of Italian descent and to families active in neighbouring Mace donia (Parissaki forthcoming). An overview of the Roman nomina in Thrace as a whole is now available in a dedicated study (Camia 2013). One more group of personal names, namely theophoric ones, related to the cults of Apollo and Dionysos, to Hera and the Nymphs, has also been studied separately (Parissaki 2007b). An analysis of the evidence offered both by personal names and by the relevant literary, epigraphic and numismatic sources has highlighted the importance of these cults in the cities of Aegean Thrace. Work on the corpus of inscriptions has also facilitated studies on the architectural form of the monuments. Domna Terzopoulou (2000) focuses on the funerary monuments of the Molyvoti peninsula. A monograph devoted to the types of funerary monuments of Aegean Thrace is currently in preparation by Dimitra Andrianou and will be published soon in the Meletemata series. Studies of a more general nature, devoted to the historical topography of southwestern Thrace, are presented in volume 1 of Thrakika Zetemata (Loukopoulou and Psoma 2008; see also SEG LVIII 673). On the evidence of literary testimonia, inscriptions and coins, the authors formulate the hypothesis that the ancient site on the Molyvoti peninsula should not be identified with Stryme (as suggested by the first excavator, Georgios Bakalakis, in 1967, and widely accepted since then), but rather with Archaic and Classical Maroneia. Later the civic centre was transferred, after its destruction by the Macedonians, to the site of Agios Charalambos, where it flourished in Hellenistic and Roman times. It is hoped that the ongoing excavations mentioned above will bring to light the kind of evidence necessary to settle the question. Ample use of the region's epigraphic material has also been made in two numismatic corpora published 86 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 mm: \ · , ψ 106. Abdera: dedication to Zeus Hypsistos, fourth century AD (TThrAeg Ε19). © National Hellenic Research Foundation.</page><page sequence="87">Recent epigraphic research in Thasos, Aegean Thrace &amp; Samothrace (2005-2015) during the last decade: those of Abdera (Chryssanthaki-Nagle 2007) and Maroneia (Psoma et al. 2008). Publication of the inscriptions of Aegean Thrace has also facilitated the integration of the region's epi graphic material within wider analyses pertaining to the whole of Thrace. Thus, the region's onomastic material was fully integrated into Dan Dana's studies on Thracian personal names (see especially Dana 2011; also BE 2012: 282; as well as his recent book on the Onomasticon Thracicum, Dana 2014). In Anja Slawisch's publication of the funerary monuments of the Roman province of Thrace, material from Aegean Thrace is represented selectively (Slawisch 2007; see also the relevant comments in AnnEpigr 2009: 1230; BE 2009: 325). Few new documents have come to light in Aegean Thrace since the publication of IThrAeg. A gladia torial stele, reported to have been found in the Roman cemetery of Plotinopolis, has been published by Athanasia Tsoka (2013-2014). Apart from a detailed description of the stele's relief, which depicts a stand ing gladiator, probably a secutor, and an analysis of the accompanying epigram, Tsoka offers an overview of gladiatorial games in the cities of Aegean Thrace (a brief analysis of gladiatorial combats held at the theatres of Abdera and Maroneia is presented in Karadedos and Koukouli-Chrysanthaki 2007; see also SEG LVII608,616). Two short Latin inscriptions engraved on a shield came to light during the excavation of a cemetery of the Roman period (first to third century AD) at Lithochori. This is situated west of the Nestos river and thus technically outside the limits of the present study, but it is likely that this area belonged to the westernmost limits of Topeiros (Poulios et al. 2007: fig. 9; see also AnnEpigr 2010: 1452). The first inscription has been interpreted as a fabricant's mark and the second as a personal name (T. Gaius Sitas), quite probably that of the deceased. Sitas may have been a Thracian aristocrat (a strategosl) pos sessing Roman citizenship (ID2308; AR 57 [2010-2011] 98-99). A few more inscribed fragments com plement the picture. Five stone plaques with masons' marks were reused to cover a tomb of the Hellenistic period at the cemetery of Chortolivado at Abdera (ADelt 55 [2000] 883; see also BE 2010: 413). The dis covery at Abdera of a third-century AD partially preserved marble stele {ADelt 61 [2006] 1043) and a plaque with a partially preserved text (Kallintzi and Chryssaphi 2007:458, fig. 5) have also been reported. A clay tile found at Diomedeia, on the northern periphery of Abderan territory, with the genitive Θασίων, has been presented by Konstantina Kallinzti and Stratis Papadopoulos (2007: 451, fig. 8 ; BE 2011: 47 [M. Sève]; SEG LVIII 700). The excavators see here a sign of the region's commercial transactions with Thasos, while Michel Sève suggests a possible extension of Thasos' continental territory in this direction. Six fully or partially preserved milestones, still unpublished, will eventually contribute to a better knowl edge of the region's topography during the Roman period (see provisionally ADelt 61 [2006] 1034-35). Samothrace During the decade 2005-2015, epigraphic research in Samothrace has focused mainly on the study of inscriptions unearthed at the Sanctuary of the Great Gods during the course of excavations conducted there by the Institute of Fine Arts and the ASCSA. Due to the efforts of the local 19th EPCA, inscriptions (more often than not, directly or indirectly connected with the sanctuary) have also been spotted on dif ferent parts of the island. Restoration of the Nike of Samothrace in the Louvre (see Palagia, this volume) and a collective volume in honour of the Director Emeritus of the sanctuary excavations, J.R. McCredie (Palagia and Wescoat 2010), have also enriched our knowledge of the island's epigraphic material. As in Aegean Thrace, epigraphic studies took an important step forward with the publication of the excellent corpus on theoroi and initiates at the Sanctuary of the Great Gods compiled by Nora Dim itrova (Dimitrova 2008; AnnEpigr 2008:1205-09; BE 2010:495; EBGR 2008: 38; SEG LVIII 946; review in BMCR [K.M. Bedigan]). Not only does this study cover a large portion of the island's epigraphic mate rial - three-quarters according to the editor's estimate - but the corpus also offers useful overviews of dif ferent subjects related to the sanctuary's religious life and to mystery cults in general. The corpus contains 171 inscriptions, 28 of which refer to theoroi - sacred ambassadors sent to the Sanctuary of the Great Gods mostly from the cities of Macedonia, Thrace, Asia Minor and the Aegean islands - while 143 pertain to initiation and most record initiates. Among inscriptions relating to theoroi, two are previously unpub lished. No. 11 mentions, among other matters, theoroi of the koinon of Dionysiac artists (already attested Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 87</page><page sequence="88">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 on the island), while no. 17 refers to theoroi from the cities of Stratonikeia and Sardis. No. 23 is included in an earlier publication by Dimitris Matsas and Nora Dimitrova on epigraphic finds from outside the sanctuary's boundaries (Matsas and Dimitrova 2006; see also AnnEpigr 2006: 123SM-0; BE 2006: 321; EBGR 2007: 91; SEG LVI 1008-12). Among inscriptions pertaining to initiates, over 30 are previously unpublished (nos 31, 55, 63, 74-75, 81, 84-86, 95-96, 105, 109-110, 114-16, 123-26, 128, 133, 136, 140, 146-48,151,158, 160,166-67). Among those recently published, we could single out three records of initiates - one from Byzantion and Perinthos, and two for initiates of unknown origin - discussed by Matsas and Dimitrova (Matsas and Dimitrova 2006: nos 39,131, 138 of the corpus). One record includes members of the last Thracian, and more specifically Sapaian, ruling family of the client-kingdom of Thrace (no. 46). It therefore dates to the years just before the creation of the province in AD 46. The text was pre sented by Kevin Clinton (forthcoming) at the still unpublished congress in memory of Evangelos Pentazos and has also been discussed by Slavcho Kirov (Kirov 2011; see also AnnEpigr 2011: 1157; BE 2012: 285). It mentions Gaius Iulius Rhascus as a son of Rhoimetalces, identified as Rhoimetalces II {Prosopographia Imperii Romani21 517) by the first editor and as Rhoimetalces III (Prosopographia Imperii Romani2 R 68) by Kirov. In either case, the text offers welcome additional information to aid the restitution of this family's problematic genealogy. Inscriptions regarding initiates and initiation naturally constitute an important source for the study of the sanctuary's religious life, and have been considered in more general studies devoted to the topic. The two well-known inscriptions prohibiting entry to αμύητοι have been discussed by Clinton in order to define more clearly the meaning of μύησις (Clinton 2008; see also SEG LVIII 946; EBGR 2008: 30).The evidence of inscriptions mentioning θεωροί and έπόπται has been combined with the literary sources to define the two stages of initiation - μύησις and εποπτεία - modelled on that of the Eleusinian Mysteries (Clinton 2003b). Dimitrova's corpus has also enriched the island's local and foreign prosopographic and onomastic material. Fourteen new named basileis, nine theoroi (thus ca. 250 names in total) and about 100 initiates (700 now against 600 of previous accounts) have been added to the relevant catalogues (and are conveniently gathered in indexes at the end of the corpus). Honorary inscriptions and dedications, mostly dating to the Late Hellenistic and Roman periods, are testimony to the sanctuary's international reputation. A welcome new addition is the publication by Clinton and Dimitrova of the honorary inscription of Q. Lutatius Catulus, honoured as πάτρων, ευεργέτης and σωτήρ της πόλεως by the demos of Maroneia, restored convincingly by the editors (Clinton and Dimitrova 2010; AnnEpigr 2010: 1453; SEG LX 941). The honorand is to be identified with the consul of 78 BC, rather than with his father. Thus, a connection with the dramatic events suffered by Maroneia during the Mithridatic War, and described in the 'eternal decree' mentioned above, seems quite probable. A dedica tion set up at the Sanctuary of the Great Gods by the Thessalian Koinon (no. 26 of Dimitrova's corpus) has also formed the subject of a separate publication (Pounder and Dimitrova 2003; BE 2004: 246; EBGR 2003: 135; SEG LIII 916). The League's delegation, composed of two citizens of Pherai and two from Larissa, included at its head Damothoinos, son of Leontomenes, identified by the editor as the strategos of the Thessalian League in 161/0 BC. Among extant funerary inscriptions, mention should be made of that commemorating Κορράνη, with no patronymic, but designated as Ιερά, probably dating to the second century BC (Karadima-Matsa and Clinton 2002; BE 2003: 421; EBGR 2002: 221). A funerary epigram, of unknown exact provenance but thought to originate from Amphipolis and tentatively dated to the second or first century BC, informs us that the Athenian Isidores Nikostratou was an initiate of the mysteries of Eleusis and of Samothrace. The epitaph forms the subject of an earlier publication (Karadima and Dimitrova 2003; see also BE 2004: 247; EBGR 2003: 83) and has also been included in Dimitrova's corpus (no. 29, with additions to the first com mentary of the text), since it offers valuable information on the sanctuary's rituals. Line 16 offers the first epigraphic attestation of the name Kabiros at Samothrace. Extensive restoration work on the Nike of Samothrace, launched by the Louvre in 2013, has also sparked interest in the statue base and the inscribed fragment with the signature of the sculptor Pythokri tos, son of Timocharis, and the ethnic Rhodios. Marianne Hamiaux's well-founded objections to the asso 88 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="89">Recent epigraphic research in Thasos, Aegean Thrace &amp; Samothrace (2005-2015) ciation of this fragment with the statue of Nike have repercussions not only for the definition of the statue's workshop and its chronology, but also for the identity of its donors and the restitution of its historical context (Hamiaux 2006; see also SEG LVI1015-16). Anew proposal for its context has been put forward recently by Palagia (Palagia 2010; see also Palagia, this volume). A fragmentary inscription of undefined character, engraved on the marble doorjamb of the eastern entrance of the Neorion, and also mentioning a Rhodian, has been presented by Robert Pounder (2010; see also SEG LX 2010: 942). Since the building dates to the third century BC, and the graffito to the third century AD, the editor relates its presence to a later repair of the building or of the ship sheltered in it. A fragment of a mouldmade bowl dated to the second century BC is connected to the well-known workshop of Kirbeis via the potter's signature. Although the production of this workshop seems well represented on the northern and western shores of the Black Sea, its location is still a matter of dispute (Rotroff 2010; SEG LX 2010: 943). Last, but not least, three short texts - one dipinto and two graffiti - on the rims of votive kylikes of the end of the sixth and the first half of the fifth century BC (Matsas 2004: fig. 2; see also Brixhe 2006: 138) probably belong to the same group of non-Greek inscriptions long known from the Sanctuary of the Great Gods (approximately 75 sherds and one stone inscription, see Fraser 1960: 64) and from the Sanctuary of Apollo at Zone, mentioned above. As noted by the editor, the find-spot, in the sanctuary at Mandai' Panagia in the south of the island, seems closely related to two adja cent settlements of the Early Iron Age, thus further supporting a connection with the island's pre-colonial element.

Introduction In keeping with the new format of Archaeological Reports, this contribution takes a thematic approach. It seeks to draw wider attention to some of the diverse new primary research that has taken place since 2000 on Minoan (here glossed as Proto- and Neopalatial) extra-urban sanctuaries. For many years, dis cussion of these sites has largely involved synthesis. No example of a Minoan extra-urban sanctuary has ever progressed all the way from systematic excavation to full publication. Some of the best reported examples, such as the Psychro Cave (Watrous 1996) or the peak sanctuary ofPetsophas (Rutkowski 1991), were excavated at the beginning of the 20lh century. Until the period covered by this review, there were only one or two cases where sites excavated more recently had benefited from extended preliminary pub lications. This has meant that synthetic treatments have been highly dependent, in the majority of cases, on extremely brief notices of excavations or on scholars' impressions from simply visiting sites. The last 15 years have witnessed a marked change of pace. New sites have been discovered and excavated, exten sive studies of old material have been produced and, most importantly, the first comprehensive studies of some of the assemblages of objects from these sites have come into the public domain. As a result, this is an opportune time to highlight a dynamically evolving field of research. Peak sanctuaries Many of the most significant recent contributions to primary research on peak sanctuaries have come from central Crete. Amongst the most important of these have been the various studies on aspects of three sites in the region that have clear Neopalatial periods of use: Vrysinas, Kophinas and Juktas. The peak sanctuary at Vrysinas, close to Rethymnon, was initially excavated by Costis Davaras (Davaras 1973; 1974; Davaras and Brice 1977). Work resumed in the 2000s under the direction of Iris Tzachili. The new programme of work has included reinvestigation of the old material, renewed exca vation and a survey of the area immediately around the sanctuary (ID1841, ID2817, ID4529; Tzachili 2003; 2011 ; 2012; Papadopoulou and Tzachili 2005; 2010; Kordatzaki 2010; Sphakianakis 2012; Vilaki doi: 10.1017/S0570608415000101 Archaeological Reports 61 (2014-2015)94-103</page><page sequence="95">Recent research into Minoan extra-urban sanctuaries and Daskalakis 2012). This recent work has already yielded such substantial results that the site can be said to have become one of the best understood examples of the type. The summit of Vrysinas, the likely focal point of the ancient cult, is now occupied by a church. Both old and new excavations concentrated on the slopes surrounding the church, in particular the more gradual northern slope. Undoubtedly, the most important aspect of the work that has appeared in print so far relates to the site's pottery assemblage. Two studies of the material from the 1970s excavations, one broad (Tzachili 2003), the other focused (Faro 2008), are complementary in their conclusions. The vast majority of the pottery is reported to be undecorated, and conical cups make up a very large proportion of the overall assemblage. One very interesting phenomenon is chronological: 79-80% of the diagnostic sherds are Neopalatial in date. This predominance is in stark contrast to the earliest accounts of the site, before it was excavated (Alexiou 1963: 315-16), in which prehistoric activities were dated to the Protopalatial period. Moreover, the first impressions of the current excavators reflected a similar perception. They initially picked out the Proto palatial as the most prominent period in the newly excavated material (Papadopoulou and Tzachili 2005). Elissa Faro's study may point to one contributing factor behind this discrepancy; whereas fine-ware sherds, normally the most immediately datable in fieldwork, make up 32% of the Protopalatial assem blage, they make up only 12% of the Neopalatial assemblage. Some of the more minor features of the pottery assemblage are worth highlighting because they chime with snippets of information available about other peak sanctuaries in central Crete. One phenomenon that emerges from the data is a striking increase in the number of cooking pots during the Neopalatial period (from less that 1% to 15% of the assemblage). This parallels Juktas, where the increase in the number of cooking pots during the Early Neopalatial period was sufficiently striking to attract notice in the preliminary reports (Karetsou 1974: 238). Another parallel with the reported pottery from Juktas comes in the form of a class of trays or shallow basins (compare Faro 2008: fig. 5.13 or Papadopoulou and Tzachili 2010: fig. 15 with Karetsou 1981: fig. 27) that form a minor but distinctive part of the assemblage. Finally, the first volume of the site's final publication has been devoted to vessels with appliqué decoration (Tzachili 2011). These take the form of various buckets and basins, and the appliqué decorations include renditions of rocky land scapes, ovicaprids, birds and the occasional human figure. Vessels with attached figures are reminiscent of finds at other central Cretan peak sanctuaries, like Juktas and Kophinas. The rocky landscapes resonate both with new discoveries at peak sanctuaries in the Pediada (at Liliano: ID3625) and with depictions in relief on stone rhyta that have traditionally been identified as peak sanctuaries (Platon 1951: 154-5 5 ; 1971: 163-7). In terms of the other classes of finds, new information is sparser. Large quantities of terracotta figurines were found by both the old and new excavations. The latest reports always refer to the animal figurines as specifically bovine. An overwhelming predominance of bovine figurines is found at other central Cretan peak sanctuaries, where information is available (Petsophas: Myres 1902-1903: 377; Juktas and Kophinas: Zeimbeki 1998: 247; Atsipades: Peatfield 1992: 72; Liliano: ID3625; Sklaverochori: ID3627). The recent reports illustrate both crude/stylized versions and remarkably well-rendered naturalistic ones (Papadopoulou and Tzachili 2005: figs 92-93; 2010: fig. 10). The human figurines, which are apparently less numerous, also come in crude/stylized (Papadopoulou and Tzachili 2010: fig. 11) and naturalistic versions (Sphakianakis 2012). The new hieroglyphic inscription from the site is on a sealstone, not on a stone vessel (Hallager et al. 2011). A report on the survey will apparently appear in the long-delayed proceedings of the Tenth Creto logical Congress. For the moment, we have been told that, in spite of the well-watered locality, nearby settlement is of a later date. In the case of Kophinas, which lies near the village of Kapetaniana in the south of Crete, three studies appearing in 2014 have promoted this example into being one of the most well-documented peak sanctuaries in terms of material available in print. Alexandra Karetsou (2014) usefully brings together her own excavation material with that from previous work on the site (Karetsou and Rethemio takis 1992-1993). The result is a clear vision of the variety of material from Kophinas, which differs from previous attempts at synthesis (for example Jones 1999). Interestingly, the site parallels Vrysinas Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 95</page><page sequence="96">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 in chronological terms, in that it was initially thought to be Protopalatial in date (Karetsou 2014: 125), until excavation revealed that activity was concentrated in the Early Neopalatial period. Giorgos Rethemiotakis (2014) explores the symbolism of the anthropomorphic figurines from the site. This sig nificantly strengthens our understanding of the figurine repertoires of these sites by providing an inter mediate triangulating comparison to the partially published corpora of anthropomorphic figurines - those from Petsophas (Rutkowski 1991) and Atsipades (Peatfield 1992). Finally, Alexia Spiliotopoulou (2014) offers an extensive account of the pottery from Kophinas, providing our second such study and a basis for comparison with Vrysinas. This new study ably illuminates both general similarities and local peculiarities. Importantly, all the Kophinas material echoes, both in overall complexion and in significant details, the information available from other central Cretan peak sanctuaries. As at Vrysinas, the pottery consists predominantly of handle-less cups. Bowls and trays with appliqué decoration echo finds at Vrysinas and Juktas. As at many peak sanctuaries, the animal figurines are predominantly bovine. As at Juktas (Karetsou 1981: 146) and Petsophas (Rutkowski 1991: 29), the anthropomorphic figurines are predominantly male. Terracotta arms wearing boxing gloves are a highly specific find, paralleled by objects at Atsipades (Peat field 1992: fig. 23, where they are misidentified as phalloi) and at a variety of other peak sanctuaries (see also Rethemiotakis 2001: 126-29). Bronze votive daggers and stone libation tables, meanwhile, align with finds at a host of sanctuaries across the island. In recent years there has been some confusion over the location of the sanctuary, with some scholars (Nowicki 2007a: 577; Soetens 2009) wishing to place it on the peak of Kophinas (where there is a modern chapel and where some prehistoric surface pottery has been found), rather than at the site of the excavated temenos, which is considerably lower (occupying a knoll on a saddle leading to the rocky peak of the mountain). The reason for this is that the former site fits better with modern scholarly preoccupations and approaches to the characterization of peak sanctuar ies, such as site inter-visibility and visual sight-lines. One of the most important contributions of Karet sou's paper (2014) is to make this discussion more explicit, and to point out the wealth of other nearby places where Bronze Age activity/surface finds have , . been identified. The area is, after all, well within the potential productive agricultural landscape (Fig. , : : 107). As Karetsou hints, given that the artefactual M record from the temenos fits perfectly with that from other central Cretan peak sanctuaries, it may be better Jhi. t0 continue the recently instigated questioning of 107.

The question of interpretation is further complicated by the fact that the site of the excavated temenos may even fit with modern topographic priorities (at least as they are understood by Krzysztof Nowicki [2007b]), but only from one angle - from the small river valley running down to Kapetaniana in the west (Fig. 108).

Recent publication of the material from the sanctuary itself has consisted of detailed information on the forms, contexts and parallels for some of the more singular and striking objects mentioned in these preliminary reports (Karetsou et al. 2002-2003; Karetsou 2005; 2012; Karetsou and Koehl 2011; 2013; 2014). Equally important has been the wealth of information made available on the nearby building at Alonaki, situated on a saddle of the mountain, adjacent to the peak sanctuary (Simandiraki 2002; Karetsou and Mathioudaki 2012; Karetsou 2013). This building is associated with a paved outdoor space and has a large number of external doorways for its size. It lacks figurines, but has some other finds with distribution patterns focused on peak sanctuaries - like five so-called 'stone ladles' (cf. Bevan 2007: 131, fig. 6.19). The other objects attest to the preparation and serving of food, and to craft activities. Most notably it has a very confined period of occupation - limited to Middle Minoan III. It gives an important new dimension to questions about how cult on Juktas was organized and by whom. It is also worth noting that, for a sanc tuary that tends to be automatically attached to Knossos throughout its lifespan, the Alonaki building con tributes to a picture of dynamism and change. Alongside this outbreak of detailed information about long-known peak sanctuaries, the centre of the island has also produced a flurry of newly-identified examples of the type. In the Pediada, east of Knossos, two new examples have been excavated by Giorgos Rethemiotakis at Sklaverochori (ID3627) and Liliano (ID3625). A third new site on Koutsoura hill near Amnissos and Elia was excavated in 2012-2013 by Athanasia Kanta, Marina Panagiotaki and Nikos Panagiotakis (mentioned at http://dms.aegean.gr/npooo)7u κό-δεπ/παναγιωτάκη- μαρίνα ). West of Knossos, between Heraklion and Rethymnon, three new sites have been discovered: at Krousonas Gournos (ID3623), Mavrou Koriphi (Andreadaki-Vlazaki 2004: 35) and Alpiki Zoni (presented by Danai Kontopodi, Kostas Georgakopoulos and Michalis Spyridakis at the third Ergon Kritis conference in 2013). These six new sites go a long way to redressing the imbalance whereby the distribution of peak sanctuaries seemed previously to be heavily weighted to the east of the island. That they should have been discovered within such a short period of time strongly suggests that the currently understood distribution of the type is heavily predicated on patterns of exploration and dis covery; it should be viewed with extreme caution. By comparison with the centre of the island, primary research on peak sanctuaries elsewhere has been much less intense. Nowicki (2007b) has reported the discovery of several more candidate sites, including, significantly, one in the far west of the island - an area previously lacking examples. Results of the work on the new site of Anatoli Stavromenos, west of Ierapetra, by Chryssa Sophianou, Yiannis Papadatos and Konstatinos Chalikias were presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America. Alongside the discovery of new sanctuaries has been the definitive removal of at least one from the list of candidates, with Davaras' (2010) re-examination of Thylakas, a site that had previously divided scholarly opinion, proving that it belongs to a much later period. Finally, it is worth highlighting Nowicki's article (2012) covering the peak sanctuaries of the far east of Crete. As an in-depth treatment of the historiography and rationale for the identification of these sites, it is the kind of work that the discipline has been sorely in need of for many years. It will come as a shock to many readers, for instance, to discover that some sites that regularly appear on lists of certain peak sanc tuaries, like Ziros Plagia or Korphi tou Mare, are only known from hearsay, having been destroyed before they were ever visited by an archaeologist. His discussion of Phaneromeni Trachilos, a site with many of the features of a peak sanctuary, but lying at sea level, should add further grist to the mill of debate about the cogency of modern categories alluded to above. Further afield, the publication of the peak sanctuary at Agios Giorgios on Kythera (Sakellarakis 2011-13), the identification of a second candidate on the island at Leska (Georgiadis 2012), the identification of Late Bronze Age cult activity on mountains in the Pelo ponnese, at the later Sanctuary of Zeus on Mount Lykaion (Roman and Voyatzis 2014) and at Prophitis Elias on Mount Archnaion (presented by Olga Psychoyou at the Mycenaean Seminar at the University of Athens on 24th January 2013; To Βήμα 21st January 2013), may mean that the time is coming when the question of religious interaction between Crete and the rest of the Aegean needs to be readdressed. Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 97</page><page sequence="98">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 Kato Syme Viannou The sanctuary site of Kato Syme, in its palatial Bronze Age phases, does not fit into any broader category of religious site identified on the ground elsewhere (the category of 'sacred enclosure', in which it is some times placed, is primarily an iconographie one). Although currently unique, like Juktas, it benefits from very full preliminary reports. The steadily progressing publication series has concentrated, thus far, more on the important Iron Age and Archaic phases of the site than on the Bronze Age. Nevertheless, each of the volumes of the series that have appeared within the last 15 years is important to Bronze Age archae ologists in its own way. The latest contribution by Kostandinos Christakis (2014), covering the potters' marks, is obviously relevant, as is the first section of Angeliki Lebessi's (2002a) volume on bronze anthro pomorphic figures. The penultimate volume by Polymnia Muhly (2008), covering the handmade terracotta animal figurines, is (counter-intuitively) important to the Bronze Age because it dates all the examples from the site to the Iron Age. The lack of handmade animal figurines from the Bronze Age accentuates the distinctiveness of the Kato Syme assemblage in comparison with those from other peak sanctuaries. It differs both in what is present (large numbers of highly unusual vessels - chalices and stands) and in what is absent (terracotta animal figurines). The recently published (Lebessi 2002b; Muhly 2012) terracotta foot model and pair of terracotta feet in an exedra, on the other hand, would be at home in a peak sanctuary of the period. Meanwhile, an unpublished University of Thessaloniki PhD thesis by Nikolaos Zariphis (2008) provides an extremely useful clarification of the complex phasing of the site. Caves Cretan caves enjoyed a period of archaeological interest in the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century, when theories of primitive chthonic religion were at their height. But for the latter half of the 20th century they were largely eclipsed by peak sanctuaries as a focus of scholarly attention. Scholars have long relied on the unpublished thesis of Loeta Tyree for their understanding of cult in Bronze Age caves (1974). The last 15 years have seen a flurry of activity, not least from Tyree herself. The result mirrors that for peak sanctuaries in radically increasing the amount of detailed data available in print. In the three-volume publication of the Idean Cave (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 2013) the Bronze Age finds are unsurprisingly dwarfed by those from the Iron Age and Archaic period. In the latter periods the cave deserves to stand in the first division of Greek sanctuaries in terms of the impressiveness and import of the finds. In the Minoan era the cave appears to be broadly comparable to several other sacred caves in central Crete in terms of the nature of the finds. More precise comparison remains diffi cult, perhaps largely because the intensity of the later activity hinders our ability to see the Bronze Age clearly. The account of the pottery nicely illustrates the many periods in which the cave was frequented, but does not allow functional comparison with some of the assemblages being reported elsewhere. What is surely significant is the presence of Protopalatial pottery, with connections to the western Mesara (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 2013: 2.15-16). That is to say, the pottery is contemporary with the bulk of the assemblage in nearby Kamares Cave (see below), but is found in seemingly smaller quan tities. Metal blades are a key unifying feature within the Neopalatial assemblages of many of the most important central Cretan cave sanctuaries. It is therefore extremely significant, for comparative purposes, that an incised double axe, a cache of votive knife blades and a thin sheet sword blade were found in the northern niche of the cave (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 2013: 1.153, 2.125-27; but note that there is no clue in this publication as to the large number of Neopalatial votive blades cited by L. Vance Watrous (1996: 58) as coming from the cave). The Bronze Age seals from the cave naturally draw the excavators' attention, and are conveniently datable elements within a long-lived assemblage. Neverthe less, they are difficult to assess from a comparative perspective, as they are only a sporadic and never numerous element in contemporary cult assemblages elsewhere. All the illustrated terracotta figurines are Late Minoan III, which is entirely in keeping with the general scarcity of such finds in Proto- and Neopalatial cave sanctuaries, but does make the excavators' reference to terracotta figurines appearing from the Neopalatial onwards somewhat confusing (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 2013: 2.16, 2.24-30). The two kernos stones (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 2013: 2.155-56) are infrequently 98 I Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="99">Recent research into Minoan extra-urban sanctuaries paralleled at extra-urban sanctuaries, the closest parallels being from Juktas. Much more typical of such sites are stone libation tables, and it is, therefore, possibly important that the new publication makes no mention of the type. The cave at Tsoutsouros mirrors Ida in having a long history of use stretching from the Bronze Age down to the Roman period. Unlike Ida, however, it has only very rarely entered onto lists of Cretan sacred caves. For the Bronze Age, in particular, the way in which it was initially reported may have led to some doubt over the presence of a distinguishable Bronze Age phase of cult activity. As a result, it has fallen completely out of recent discussions of Minoan cult places. This makes the recent, well-illustrated publi cation of material from the cave all the more important (Kanta and Davaras 2011). This amply confirms palatial Bronze Age activity at the site. The striking thing about the finds is the degree to which they diverge from the norm of central Cretan cave sanctuary assemblages. The most distinctive finds within cave deposits of the palatial Bronze Age are usually metal items. Terracotta figurines are rare or absent and, when present, are usually the hardest to date when animal types are concerned (Tyree 2013: 181 82). Anthropomorphic figurines are usually limited to bronze and tend to be male. Tsoutsouros, by contrast, has terracotta anthropomorphic figurines broadly comparable to those from nearby Kophinas. Its bronze figurines are female. It lacks the bronze blades that play an important role in several of the most important central Cretan cave assemblages. Indeed, one of the most distinctive elements of the Tsoutsouros assem blage appears to be miniature vessels, which regularly appear in contemporary sanctuary (and non-sanc tuary) contexts but rarely make up a significant proportion of assemblages elsewhere. The cave at Kamares rivals the nearby Idean Cave in terms of name-recognition, but it has always been unusual in terms of the finds associated with it, which consist almost exclusively of pottery, including the eponymous type of high-end Protopalatial ware. The period featured in this review saw the preliminary publication of an in-depth study of the pottery from the cave, which involved renewed fieldwork in the form of collecting and examining the discarded pottery of the old excavations. The result is a model of how important data can be rescued from material that previous generations of scholars overlooked (Van de Moortel 2006; 2011). Several of the outcomes of this research are worthy of note. The site hosts a distinctive pottery assemblage already in the Early Bronze Age. There is more Neopala tial pottery at the site than previously thought, though the Protopalatial remains the main period of use. The new research puts a solid quantification on the long-recognized strangeness of the site's Protopalatial assemblage, which has pouring shapes outnumbering cups and bowls by three to one. The assemblage seems to normalize somewhat in the Neopalatial, and we are told that in that period it mirrors the assem blages at other caves, such as Skoteino. Interestingly, for neither period is there a mention of the over whelming numbers of conical cups that are reported at peak sanctuaries. Perhaps most eye-catching of all, however, is the presence of large numbers of collar necked jars in the Protopalatial period (13% of the assemblage): a shape that is argued to be closely related to the palace at Phaistos. If this is accepted, it would be one of the most concrete artefactual links between a palatial centre and an extra-urban sanctu ary; an intriguing Protopalatial counterpart to the · - * -θ architectural and topographic link between the palace 109.

No site better encapsulates the retreat of cave sanc tuaries from the scholarly mind's eye than Skoteino. Once considered by Arthur Evans (1921: 163) a Knossian cult centre to rival Juktas in importance, it is now a largely overlooked site. A new programme of work on the cave consists of mapping the complex of chambers and restudying the finds from old exca vations (Perna et al. 2005; Tyree et al. 2007; 2008; 2014). This work has placed the well-known bronze finds from the cave, which include three anthropomorphic figures (Davaras 1969), into a much more tan Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 99 JU. 109.

Interestingly, in an echo of peak sanctuaries, the earliest scholars, like Evans ( 1921 : 163), dated the activity at the cave to the period we would now call the Protopalatial, whereas in fact its main phase of use was the Neopalatial (Tyree et al. 2008: 180). The restricted pottery assemblage also bears some comparison with those known from Neopalatial peak sanctuaries; principally, plain pottery and large numbers of handle-less cups are reported. Individual items like vases with appliqué decoration and basins are also reminiscent of peak sanctuaries. Two pieces of information are particularly intriguing: that the cooking pots are predominantly of a small size and that there are large numbers of pedestalled cups and 'communion chalices', reminiscent of those that characterize Kato Syme. The results that are emerging from Skoteino also resonate intriguingly with reports relating to work done at the cave of Melidoni to prepare it for development as a tourist destination (ID 1831; Tzedakis and Gavrilaki 1995; Gavrilaki 2010). Melidoni and Skoteino are similar topographically; both are situated in depressions on low hills and adjacent to fertile lowlands and busy communication routes. Both are also similar speleologically, consisting of large, cathedral-like main chambers, with dark, narrow complexes of secondary chambers. Interestingly, in both cases the concentrations of palatial Bronze Age ritual activity appear to have been similarly situated at the junctions between the main and secondary chambers. As at Skoteino, tripod cooking pots and handleless-cups are cited as the most frequent elements of the assem blage at Melidoni, and the singling out of cup rhyta at the latter echoes a type also highlighted by the scholars working at the former. The 'cave' at Patsos is little more than a slight depression or overhang in the cliffs that line the Patsos gorge. As such it was always an outlier within the category of 'cave sanctuary' and was made more so by the character of its finds. For some time now, an important re-examination of the corpus of objects from the site, which were principally collected in the late 19th century by local villagers, had confirmed that the majority of the finds belong either to the Postpalatial periods of the Late Bronze Age, the Iron Age or even later (Kourou and Karetsou 1994; with the exception of some sherds and a palatial stone libation table reused at a later date, most of the other finds that might be placed in the Neopalatial are difficult to posi tively date stylistically). Renewed excavation, reported in the period covered by this review (ID1846, ID3612), has confirmed the lack of palatial Bronze Age activity under the overhang itself, where the ear liest layers are Archaic. At the same time, investigators found intriguing evidence of Proto- and Neopalatial activity on the slope alongside the stream which lies at the foot of the gorge. This evidence takes the form of a series of terraces, hosting pyres lit in rock cavities, around which were concentrations of handle-less cups (see also http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/gh251 .jsp?obj_id=7166). This is potentially exciting because it is reminiscent not so much of cave sanctuaries but of the otherwise unique site at Kato Syme, where an assemblage, primarily consisting of pottery, is found associated with pyres alongside a stream. It will be interesting to see whether this similarity is borne out by the details of the pottery assemblage, when these emerge in the fullness of time. Conspectus and prospects The new research to which this contribution seeks to draw attention represents the beginning of a quiet revolution in our understanding of Proto- and Neopalatial Minoan sacred spaces. In the first place, the works cited here give a much clearer view of why, in a broader discipline saturated with an interest in ritual and religion, these most distinctly religious of places have received relatively short shrift from scholars. Sites lacking structures, or with minimal substantial architecture, and characterized by long periods of use suffer from mixed deposits. Many of these sites have plain pottery assemblages. They are interesting for that very reason, but this has combined with poor stratigraphy and preservation to make them an off-putting prospect to previous generations of scholars. It is the modern tendency to publish the functional cross section of assemblages, rather than a typological selection of diagnostic pieces, that is beginning to allow this material its full interpretive potential. Similarly, some of the other materials from these sites, like hand made terracotta figurines or appliqué vessels, whilst they may sound appealing in principle, present an unappetising prospect when they form a huge mass of fragmentary, worn material. Moreover, such objects are often poorly paralleled in closed deposits at other types of site, which complicates their interpretation 100 | Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="101">Recent research into Minoan extra-urban sanctuaries in multiple ways. The studies cited here, which are braving these substantial problems, are already bringing about substantial changes in our understanding. Old patterns, like the east Cretan priority in peak sanctu aries, are fading. New patterns are emerging, like the flurry of activity in central Crete around the beginning of the Neopalatial period - which saw intense and perhaps new activity at several peak sanctuaries (Kophi nas, Liliano, Krousonas Gournos) - the short life of the building at Alonaki on Juktas and major construc tion within the sanctuary of Juktas itself. The fact that such change can happen relatively rapidly demonstrates both how this has been a neglected field and the considerable potential of further studies. Bibliography Alexiou, S.

The development of style is, nevertheless, giving way now to the study of materials and techniques, as well as the historical perspectives underlying the production of sculpture at any given period. An additional difficulty is the fact that new material that comes to light is not always easily available for study, and even old material can remain out of bounds due to bureaucratic barriers. Current research tends to concentrate on the detection of polychromy on marble sculptures, a process which is best undertaken in the conservation departments of museums. 3D scanning is another expensive method which is currently being developed in various research directions. The past ten years have witnessed some sensational new discoveries, with the potential to change the history of Greek sculpture when the material is properly published and digested. A series of exhibitions has highlighted questions of polychromy, but has neglected neither the achievements of individual sculptors nor the impact of art works on later periods of classical antiquity. Publications about sculpture now tend to take the form of individual articles, collective volumes or museum catalogues. A few monographs have appeared, notably on architectural sculptures. A new handbook of Greek sculpture soon to be published by De Gruyter attempts to pull the threads together, summarizing new achievements and pointing to future directions for the discipline (Palagia 2016). Archaic sculpture - new finds In 2010 a group of twin kouroi in Parian marble was confiscated from the hands of illicit excavators (ID1424; Kissas 2013: 80-82). The Ephoreia of the Corinthia conducted an excavation in the field at Tenea in which it was found and uncovered an ancient cemetery. Further fragments of the kouroi also came to light. They were originally placed on top of a common burial pit, containing two sarcophagi with the remains of two men of the same age. The kouroi date from about 530-520 BC and are very similar except for minor details. Twin kouroi were hitherto known only from the early sixth century, like the group of Kleobis and Biton from Delphi (Rolley 1994: fig. 146). The kouroi from Tenea therefore enhance our understanding of the development of later Archaic sculpture. The earliest extant Archaic kore from Attica, which is also the earliest sculpture in Hymettian marble, was confiscated from illicit diggers at Anavyssos in 1973 and published by Olga Tzachou-Alexandri in 2012. It is a headless torso holding a lotus flower, which indicates a funerary function. It is dated ca. 600 BC, based on a comparison of its hairstyle to that of the Dipylon group of kouroi (Alexandri 2012). It is remarkable that Hymettian marble was used so early for the production of free-standing sculptures. The fragments of a unique kore from the Peloponnese, found reused in a fourth-century BC temple by the Canadian excavators at Stymphalos in 1996, were published by Mary Sturgeon in 2014. The kore is made of Parian marble in an Attic style, holds a hare and can be dated to 490-480 BC (Sturgeon 2014). Archaic sculpture - new developments The votive kouroi from the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Sounion, in the Athens National Museum {ca. 600 BC), rank among the earliest marble sculptures found in Attica (Fig. 110). Their marble has hitherto been identified as Naxian and they have been used as evidence, alongside the funerary kouroi of the Dipylon group (Niemeier 2002: 40-53), that marble sculpture was introduced to Athens by the Naxians. doi: 10.1017/S0570608415000113 Archaeological Reports 61 (2014-2015) 104-114</page><page sequence="105">Greek sculpture, Archaic, Classical &amp; Hellenistic: new finds &amp; developments 2005-2015 Stable isotope analysis, EPR spectroscopy and maximum grain size measurements, however, have established that the Sounion kouroi are made of Parian marble (Palagia et al. 2015). This indicates that the impetus for the introduction of marble sculpture to Athens can be attributed not only to Naxos but also to Paros. The conservation department of the Acropolis Museum has been conducting research on the pigments of the Archaic sculptures from the Acropolis. The results are incorporated into new museum labels and a booklet (Pandermalis 2012). Classical sculpture - new finds A headless torso of Athena (Fig. Ill) in Parian marble, dating from ca. 430 BC, was acquired on the Roman art market by the Fondazione Sorgente Group and placed on display in its exhibition space in Rome in 2013. It was established as a Classical original, removed from Greece to Rome in the Roman period, and identified with Athena Nike, on account of a cutting for the addition of a marble wing at the back (La Rocca 2013). The style of the figure is close to Attic document reliefs of the decade 330-320 BC, suggesting an Athenian provenance. The reduced scale of the statue and the large dowel hole at the back indicate that it belonged to a pediment. The cuttings for wings very likely belong to a Roman phase. The Pitcairn 'Victory', a Roman copy of the Sorgente Athena in the Glencairn Museum in Pennsylvania, also lacks wings, thus casting doubts on any association with Athena Nike. 111.

This suggests that the backs of the pedimental statues of the Parthenon were painted. Hellenistic sculpture - new finds An extraordinary family group, a masterpiece of Greek sculpture, in what appears to be Parian marble, came to light outside a Macedonian tomb at Pydna, Macedonia, in 2014 (Makrygialos). The excavators, Manthos Bessios and Athena Athanassiadou (Ephoreia of Pieria), have written the following about the find (personal communication). Rescue excavations in the ancient northern cemetery of Pydna, along the waterfront of the modern village of Makrygialos in northern Pieria, brought to light a funerary precinct that can be attributed to a powerful family of one of the Companions of Alexander the Great. Between the monumental tombs and the ancient road leading from Pydna to Methone, we uncovered the foundations of a large sculp tured monument that were robbed before the first century BC. The foundations are Η-shaped, 35m long and 4m wide, with wings projecting east and west. The northeast wing retains its original length of 3m. The monument faced west, towards the road. The shape, size and grandeur of this monument suggest a single original phase. A hoard of 17 bronze coins of Alexander the Great and posthumous coins of Philip II, excavated near the foundations, must have been buried after the erection of the monument, pointing to a date before 316 BC. Preliminary study of the monument allows us to reconstruct a podium, at least 4m high, decorated with a sculptured frieze on the top course. A pedestal above it supported an Ionic structure, which may have occupied the centre or even extended along the entire length of the top of the podium. The pro jecting wings, also decorated with sculptured friezes, probably carried two colossal marble statues of horsemen. We have the torso of a cuirassed horseman that once held a bronze bridle in his left hand and a horse head of remarkable quality. The extant fragments of marble sculpture from the central part of the monument seem to make up three different groups: a family farewell scene at the centre, flanked by a royal hunt and a battle scene between Macedonians and Persians. The torsos of a mature man, swathed in his chlamys, and of a youth (Fig. 112), in a short chiton and chlamys, which hangs over his left shoulder, and holding his helmet in his left hand, may belong to the farewell group. A warrior's hand holding his helmet obvi ously belongs to the same group. The hunting scene comprises the body of a panther and part of a lion's mane. A marble cauldron is attributed to the same group, perhaps indicative of a sacred grove. The battle group consists of a marble arm, which once held a metallic shield, and a lion's head helmet, recalling the headdress of Alexander the Great on the Alexander sarcophagus from Sidon (Rolley 1999: fig. 386). The back wall of the Ionic structure includes a marble slab, decorated with a horse in high relief, similar to the Attic grave relief with a horse and groom of the Athens National Museum //?

If the Ionic structure extended along the length of the entire podium, it may have carried high relief scenes in the background, combined with freestanding figures in the foreground. The Pydna monument is a unique example of high quality marble sculpture from Macedonia, dating from the period of Alexander's world domination, probably from the decade 330-320 BC. This massive sculptural commission must have been carried out by at least one (if not more) outstanding workshops. The similarities of the draped figures with the Daochos Monument in Delphi (Rolley 1999: fig. 335) point to Alexander's favourite sculptor, Lysippos and his workshop. On the other hand, the affinity of the horse to the Attic horse stele indicates Attic workmanship as well. The Athenian sculptor Leochares, who collaborated with Lysippos on the Krateros Monument in Delphi, springs to mind. A collaboration of the two artists and their workshops in Pydna is a good working hypothesis, and we must not foget that the Krateros Monument depicted a lion hunt. Another significant find of Hellenistic sculpture from Macedonia came to light, this time within a Macedonian tomb, at Amphipolis in summer 2014. The excavation was conducted as a rescue operation on the Kastas hill (which contains earlier burials on its slopes) by the Ephoreia of Serres. The methods used were somewhat unorthodox, as the excavator announced the date (late fourth century BC) and own ership of the tomb (circle of Alexander the Great) even before it was properly excavated. The well-known Lion of Amphipolis was tentatively restored on top of the Kastas hill as a grave marker without systematic argumentation. The hypothesis therefore remains under discussion. Daily bulletins were issued as the project progressed and the excavations revealed a spectacular array of colossal marble sculptures, as well as a figurai mosaic of the Rape of Persephone. Macedonian tombs do not normally contain either figurai mosaics or sculptures of any kind. There are other Macedonian tombs at Amphipolis with mosaics, but these display geometric patterns only. Even though the tomb was looted, the extraordinary sculptural finds resulted in a wave of nationalism, whipped up by the Greek media, which created expectations for the discovery of the tomb of Alexander the Great, or a member of his family, even though the burial places of these historical personalities (except for his wife Rhoxane) are already established. Alexander was of course buried in Alexandria, his mother Olympias at Pydna and the rest of his family at Aigai (Vergina). The theories concerning Alexander and his circle were abandoned with the discovery of five skeletons, comprising the remains of an old woman, a child and three men. The excavators have yet to offer a date based on stratigraphical data or other schol arly considerations. In anticipation of the study of the material, it can be pointed out, based on the photos released to the press by the authorities, that the Macedonian tomb of Amphipolis, which may date from the third century BC, appears to have been refurbished at a later time, perhaps even after the Roman con quest of Macedonia in 168 BC. The later refurbishment involved the application of marble revetment to the walls and the addition of two gateways with colossal sculptures in Thasian marble. Macedonian tombs often consist of a chamber and an ante-chamber, but the Amphipolis tomb has two ante-chambers, probably because the original dromos was converted into an outer ante-chamber with the addition of a propylon. The outer gateway is topped by a pair of colossal sphinxes, now headless, facing one another (Fig. 113). Their wings, now lost, were added separately. Macedonian tombs are not normally embellished with sculp tured propyla, while funerary sphinxes in the fourth century are usually miniature decorations on grave stelae; monumental funerary sphinxes are a feature of the Roman period. The gateway to the inner ante chamber is decorated with a pair of high-relief archaistic karyatids (Fig. 114). They too are colossal, and damaged. They raise one hand to support the entablature, while the other hand lifts the skirt folds in a dancing motion, as they advance one foot forward. They both wear a crinkly chiton under a diagonal himation, with an overfall forming a central pleat. They also wear poloi and their hair falls on their shoulders in long, corkscrew tresses. This brand of archaism does not belong to the fourth century, as archaistic statues of the late Classical period, unlike the dancing karyatids, stand xoanon-like with feet close together and hands by their sides (Zagdoun 1989: 75-76). In fact, their archaistic draperies find their closest parallel in the miniature karyatids supporting the entablature of a grave relief from Byzantium, now in the Istanbul Archaeological Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 107</page><page sequence="108">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 113.

Museum, dating to the first century BC (Fig. 115; Pfuhl and Mobius 1979: no. 2034, pi. 294). Colossal high-relief Karyatids in archaistic style can be found in the Lesser Propylaia at Eleusis dedicated by Appius Claudius Pulcher and his family just after the middle of the first century BC (Palagia 1997). In the debris of the burial chamber at Amphipolis the excavators found further fragments of sculptures, notably the colossal head and neck of a female figure wearing a polos. She has waved hair parted in the middle and falling behind her back, and turns her head at a sharp angle. The vapid, classicizing face and abrupt turn of the head are reminiscent of a colossal Late Hellenistic muse from the Kerameikos (Fig. 116; Athens National Museum inv. no. 233; La Rocca et al. 2010: 269, no. I. 27). The excavators' sugges tion that the head belonged to one of the sphinxes of the outer propylon remains sub judice, especially as they offer no explanation as to why the looters removed it to the interior of the tomb. It is remarkable that both this head, and those of the karyatids, wear a polos, emphasizing their divine nature. The sculptured propyla suggest that in a later phase the Amphipolis tomb was converted into a sacred space, transcending its funerary function. The stylistic date of the sculptures points to the first century BC, when Macedonia was under Roman domination, though the art is still Late Hellenistic. Such a late date would explain the uncanonical sculptural decoration of the interior of the tomb, a practice unknown to the Macedonians but familiar to the Romans. 108 | Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 113.

The question remains: why refurbish the tomb centuries after its original construction? We have no other parallels for the reuse of Macedonian tombs and must look for unusual circumstances that would have prompted such radical alterations to the fabric of the tomb. If we look at significant historical events involving death at or near Amphipolis, only two can be dated to the Hellenistic period: the death of Philip V of Macedon in 179 BC and the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. It is hard to see why the Macedonians would not build a new tomb for their king, however. If the tomb was refurbished to commemorate the Battle of Philippi, which marked the final event of the Roman civil wars, the unexpected presence of the skeletons of a woman and a child would have to be accounted for. The Amphipolis tomb must remain anonymous until further evidence comes to light. In August 2015 the Greek Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs issued a statement that, after fresh examination of the excavation pottery, the Amphipolis tomb should be dated to the period after the Roman conquest of Macedonia, in the late second or the first century BC (see reports in the Greek presss, for example Avgi of 9th August 2015). A spectacular, bronze, over-life-size, cuirassed torso of a horseman was fished out of the sea near Kalymnos in 2009 (Fig. 117; Daehner and Lapatin 2015: 76 fig. 5.3).

The stylistic date of the statue is ca. 200 BC. The thunder bolt suggests a Hellenistic king, perhaps one of the Antigo nids of Macedonia or the Ptolemies of Egypt. Two newly-found sculpted statue bases are of particular interest. A fragmentary trophy in Pentelic marble, excavated by the ASCSA in the northwestern corner of the Athenian agora in 2010 (Fig. 118), comprises a pile of shields, a cuirass and a sword. One of the shields carries a club of Her akles, a familiar device of Macedonian coins, notably from the reign of Philip V. A similar statue base from Delos includes a Macedonian shield with concentric patterns along the rim and has cuttings for a statue on top.

The prow of a warship in blue 'Lartian' marble from Rhodes was found by the Ephoreia of the Dodecanese in an ancient cemetery on the island of Nisyros in 2007 and is now in Nisyros Museum (Fig. 119; Philemonos-Tsopotou 2013). By analogy with the ship monument carved in the rock of the acropolis of Lindos in the second century BC (Dyggve 1960: 56-57, fig. 111.27-28, pl. IIIA-B), it must have carried the statue of a naval commander; but the sig nificance of the Nisyros ship lies in its similarity with the statue base of the Victory of Samothrace, which is also carved from 'Lartian' marble and seems to represent the 119.

Hellenistic sculpture - new developments In 2013-2014 the Louvre undertook an extensive restoration and conservation programme on the Victory of Samothrace and the ship's prow that serves as its base (Hamiaux et ai 2014). Both statue and base were cleaned, enhancing the blue colour of the 'Lartian' marble of the base that had been obscured by a brown patina. The ship was dismantled and restored with the addition of 3D scans of the fragments that remain on Samothrace. This directly affected the placement of the statue on the base with the removal of the modern addition that had served to elevate the Victory high above the ship. Special photography has revealed traces of blue, not only on the drapery of the Victory, but also on her wings. No attempt was made to rethink the 19th-century restorations of the right wing and the upper part of the Victory's torso. Her familiar image has therefore remained unaltered. However, a new display of her right hand allows the inspection of its upper part, which appears to be flat, for the attachment of a marble ribbon (Fig. 120). 120.

The past decade has seen the appearance of three cata logues of sculptures in Greece, all in Greek: the first volume on sculp tures in the Athens National Museum (Despinis and Kaltsas 2014); a volume on the sculptures in the Kavala Museum (Damaskos 2013); and the first volume on sculptures in the Rhodes Museum (Machaira 2011). A catalogue of the relief friezes of the Mausoleum of Halicar nassus in the British Museum, long in the making, was also finally published (Cook 2005). The Athens National Museum catalogue of Archaic sculptures, a collective work expertly supervised by Giorgos Despinis, should be particularly singled out for its comprehensiveness and sheer monumentality. Because it has not been possible to include any bibliography after 2008,1 would like to complement the entry on the Sounion kouros A (Fig. 110) withPalagia 2010, where it is argued that the Sounion kouroi are in Parian marble, a suggestion that has recently been verified through stable isotope analysis (see above). To the list of plaster casts of this kouros should be added the historic cast (Fig. 121) in the archaeological collection of the Faculty of History and Archaeology of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, which retains the old restorations of face and limbs that were subsequently removed from the original statue. Exhibition catalogues The new interest displayed by researchers in the colouring of ancient statuary is reflected in a travelling exhibition of painted plaster casts of Greek statues that originated in the Munich Glyptothek and is still doing the rounds in European and American cities (catalogue in English: Brinkmann and Wunsche 2007; there are also versions in German, Italian and Greek). The ghosts of painted patterns on marble have been imaginatively recreated on plaster casts with the addition of gaudy restoration of Sounion kouros A. colours, which may or may not reflect the original pigments, but at least © Hans R. Goette. introduce the modern viewer to a new conception of colourful statuary, as opposed to the neo-classical ideal of white marble. Most impressive is the reconstruction of the Severe Style torso of a warrior in the Acropolis Museum, who had previously appeared to be wearing a cuirass on his naked skin, only because the painted patterns of his clinging chiton had not been noticed before. The painted backs of the pedimental statues of the Temple of Aphaia on Aigina are now seen as never before. The pedimental statues of the Parthenon appear to have been painted in the round as well (see above). Two exhibitions dedicated to Praxiteles opened in 2007: first in the Louvre and then in the Athens National Museum with objects from Greek museums that had not been lent to Paris (Pasquier and Martinez 2007; Kaltsas and Despinis 2007). The two catalogues also differ significantly, offering different perspec tives on the famous fourth-century sculptor. A thought-provoking exhibition on the profound influence of Hellenistic sculptors on the formation of Roman taste was organized in the Capitoline Museums in 2010 (La Rocca et al. 2010), marshalling an impressive array of Hellenistic cult statues found in Rome alongside some significant loans from Greek museums (on Greek sculpture in Rome, see also^i? 60 [2013-2014] 23-24). In 2011 the Munich Glyptothek celebrated the 200th anniversary of the acquisition of the pediments of the Temple of Aphaia on Aigina with an exhibition of plaster casts and drawings, tracing the history of the sculptures since their removal from Aigina, their 19th-century restoration by Bertel Thorvaldsen and subsequent redisplay, purged of modern additions, by Dieter Ohly (Wunsche 2011).

Goette.</page><page sequence="112">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 The collection of bronze and marble sculptures from the bottom of the sea, displayed alongside other significant finds, including the Antikythera mechanism, provided one of the highlights of the exhibition on the Antikythera shipwreck at the Athens National Museum (Kaltsas et al. 2012). The Antikythera sculp tures were published by Peter Bol in 1972 but have never before been displayed as a whole, including fragments. It is a pity that the museum has no room to accommodate the Antikythera cargo of sculptures in one of its permanent galleries. New perspectives on Classical Greek art were offered by an innovative exhibition in the Liebieghaus, Frankfurt (Brinkmann 2013). Special sections were dedicated to the copies of Pheidias' chryselephantine cult statues, copies of the Sauroktonos of Praxiteles and the technical aspects of Greek bronzes. An exhibition focusing on the beauty of the human body, which formed one of the main subjects of Greek art, was organized at the British Museum in 2015 (Jenkins 2015). For the first time in its history, the British Museum moved some of the Parthenon sculptures to a temporay exhibition gallery, in order to highlight their impact on later art works. The juxtaposition of Dionysos from the east pediment of the Parthenon with the Belvedere torso, and the drawings of Michelangelo, was particularly illuminating. The question of colour was brilliantly evoked by the exhibition of a plaster cast of the Athena Lemnia, painted gold in order to look like bronze. A major exhibition of Hellenistic bronzes was organized by the Getty Museum in association with the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence in 2015 (Daehner and Lapatin 2015). An impressive number of bronzes from European and American museums, never before seen together, was assembled, including recent finds. The almost exclusively art historical approach, however, was a regression, as the statues were assessed only on grounds of style. The way forward lies in technical analysis of alloys and methods of assemblage, as exemplified by the pioneering exhibition The Fire of Hephaistos (Mattusch 1996). It is well known that Greek museums are reluctant to allow sampling of the bronze statues in their possession, thus preventing the creation of a database of Greek bronze alloys, which is essential for futhering our understanding of ancient bronze techniques. Moreover, the Greek authorites hesitate to allow publication by specialists of two large groups of Greek monumental bronzes of outstanding quality - the Piraeus bronzes and the Kalymnos bronzes - and, as a result, a significant chapter of Greek sculptural production remains to be written. Some of the entries in the Florence/Getty bronze catalogue are in need of revision. The statue base from Corinth signed by Lysippos is unaccountably dated to the third century BC and the Successor portrait from the Prado is tentatively identified with Demetrios Poliorketes, even though it does not remotely resemble any of his coin portraits. Monographs and collective books The past decade has been marked by two major publications on Pheidias: Davison 2009 collects all the information, ancient and modern, extant on the sculptor, while McWilliam et al. 2011 consists of a col lection of essays on the iconography, political implications, impact, afterlife and reception of the chryse lephantine statue of Zeus by Pheidias in Olympia. The British Museum published a very useful book on its holdings of Greek architectural sculptures (Jenkins 2006). It serves as a scholarly introduction, not only to the artististic but also to the historical back ground of some of the greatest masterpieces of Greek art. The chapters on Caria and Lycia, in particular, trace some less well-known aspects of local history that explain the form and content of the sculptures. A collective book focusing on the forms, techniques and functions of Greek sculpture in the Archaic and Classical periods (Palagia 2006) contains chapters on bronze and marble techniques, as well as surveys of the sculptural production of Athens, the Cyclades, Magna Graecia and the western coast of Asia Minor. The contributions illuminate function and techniques, rather than the individual achievements of famous masters. The swan-song of Giorgos Despinis, who passed away in 2014, is a volume on reliefs, which consists of a series of catalogue entries in anticipation of the preparation of a catalogue of reliefs held in the Athens National Museum (Despinis 2013). The book offers new insights on familiar pieces, as well as new infor mation on unpublished reliefs in the National Museum. 112 | Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="113">Greek sculpture, Archaic, Classical &amp; Hellenistic: new finds &amp; developments 2005-2015 A monograph on the architectural sculptures of temples built in Athens during the Peloponnesian War offers a comprehensive account of the style and iconography of the sculptures of the Hephaisteion, the Ilissos temple, the Nike temple and the Erechtheion, as well as the statue bases of the Pheidian circle (Leventi 2014). The final chapter contains a survey of pieces of uncertain provenance that cannot easily be placed on extant sacred buildings. Conclusion Even though the study of Greek sculpture is no longer regarded as attractive as it used to be in the 19th and 20th centuries (partly due to the reasons underlined above in the Introduction and partly due to con certed ideological attacks condemning it as élitist), Greek sculpture has not ceased to surprise us with new discoveries from unexpected quarters - such as, for example, Macedonia - and new developments in the areas of materials and techniques. The history of early Attic sculpture, for instance, needs to be rewritten, as we now know that some of the earliest Athenian statues were made in Hymettian and Parian marbles, thus indicating that marble sculpture was not introduced to Athens exclusively by Naxians. Where do we go from here? One of the avenues to be explored is that of scientific testing of marble provenance and bronze alloys. The establishment of the provenance of marbles would serve not only to clarify the nature of the marble trade, but also the origins of workshops. A database of bronze alloys would help in the dating of bronze statuary, which currently depends almost entirely on stylistic criteria. One hopes that the Greek authorities might eventually overcome their distrust of sampling. Finally, Greek sculp ture is in need of a new synthesis, explaining its significance to a new generation of students and amateurs. Bibliography Bol, P.C.

Agora of the Competaliasts (EfA) The excavation of the Agora of the Competaliasts (Figs 124, 125; ID727), directed by Claire Hasenohr (EfA/Bordeaux 3), has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the operation of the Delian emporion in the main harbour area, where activities relating to 'wholesale' trade on Delos took place. Development in this zone started during the third century BC, when Delos was established as an entrepôt during the period of the island's independence. The landfill (χώμα) mentioned in inscriptions from 217 BC onwards, was used to fill the waterfront towards the west of the Sanctuary of Apollo (Moretti 1998: 259-61; Duchêne and Fraisse 2001: 147-53). This landfill created the areas on which the Agora of the Competaliasts (GD 2), with accompanying Shops α, β and γ, the Portico of Philip and the West Portico (GD 3), and the Agora of Theophrastos (GD 49) later stood (Hasenohr 2012a: 247-49; 2012b: 102-05). Between 130 and 120 BC, the Agora of the Competaliasts was created on a previously-levelled area (Hasenohr 2002; 2004-2005). The agora was embellished with porticoes that fronted the eastern and south ern façades of the square, which gave access to Shops α, β and γ (Hasenohr 2002: 91-99). The volume standards for liquids, or sekomata, found in the shops of this area and accompanying inscriptions indicate that, at the beginning of the first century BC, the square and adjoining shops were devoted to the sale of oil and wine according to the Athenian standards of volume and overseen by the Athenian epimeletes Ariarathes (Hasenohr 2012a: 252-62; Chankowski and Hasenohr 2015: 29-36). There are five inscribed sekomata (Hasenohr 2012a: no. 4; Chankowski and Hasenohr 2015). A decree from Athens dated to the last quarter of the second century mentions the new standards for measures (IG II2 1013; see discussion in Chankowski and Hasenohr 2015: 37-39) and the Athenian epimeletes would have implemented these on Delos at this time (Hasenohr 2012a: 260; Chankowski and Hasenohr 2015: 33-36). The volume standards found in this area have a significantly larger capacity (i.e. 35-39 litres) than the volume standards found in the shops that were further away from the harbour, within the Theatre District located to the southeast of the agora (Hasenohr 2012a: 257-59; cf. Déonna 1938: 176-85). This suggests that while the measures found in the Theatre District served the local retail trade, the measures of the Agora of the Competaliasts were used for calculating the oil and wine for shipboard food supplies (Hasenohr 2012a: 260-61; 2012b: 99-105). Furthermore, the shops in the latter area were significantly bigger than the shops of the Theatre District, and were furnished with mezzanines that could accommodate the storage needs of this trade (Karvonis and Malmary 2012: 272-74).

In conjunction with the investigation of the Agora of the Competaliasts (GD 2), the EfA has taken core samples from the sacred port (GD 1) and from adjacent areas of the Agora of Theophrastos (GD 49), the Sanctuary of Apollo and the Agora of the Competaliasts (GD 2), in order to provide data for sea level change since antiquity, as well as to record the western boundaries of these areas. These studies have con firmed that the sea level has risen by 2-2.5m since the Late Hellenistic era and suggest that the westward boundaries of these regions were at a distance of about 20m from the existing shoreline (Fig. 126; Desru elles et al. 2004; 2007; Fouache et al. 2005; Dalongeville et al. 2007; cf. Mourtzas 2011). In addition, the EfA has conducted resistivity survey and electromagnetic survey in the area of the Sanctuary of Apollo, in order to trace the ancient shoreline (ID726, ID842). A NR research programme on storage spaces (EfA) The ANR research programme directed by Véronique Chankowski (EfA/Lyon 2) on the storage spaces of the island has analysed storage spaces in domestic and commercial settings in the Theatre District, the Lake District and the Stadion District (GD 79; ID730, TD1368, ID2636; http://www.entrepots-anr.efa.gr/p presentation_fr.htm). The programme conducted structural and functional analyses of storage areas in shops, workshops and houses (Chankowski et al. 2010). The study of storage spaces in commercial settings by Pavlos Karvonis (Academy of Athens) and Jean Jacques Malmary (Institut de recherche sur l'architecture antique, Centre national de la recherche scien tifique) showed how shops located in close proximity to the port (for example room 6 on street 4 [Rue 4] and rooms 30 and 47 on the Street of the Theatre [Rue du théâtre]) were furnished with shelves and mez zanines, which may have served as storage spaces (Fig. 127; Karvonis and Malmary 2009; 2012).

The upper floor was thus accessible through a separate entrance from the street and could be let separately. In addition, pots embedded in soil led to the identification of shops selling liquids or cereals - for example room 4 on the Street of the Theatre and room 1 on the Upper Street of the Theatre ('Rue supérieure du Théâtre'; Fig. 127). Furthermore, the study of the shops on the seafront ('Magasins du bord de mer'), to the south of the main harbour area, for example the Shop with the Bathtub ('Magasin à la baignoire', GD 122A; Fig. 124) and the Shop with Columns ('Magasin des colonnes', GD 122B; Fig. 124), is currently underway, and Karvonis and Malmary are now preparing the publication of these shops. Study of domestic architecture The study of domestic settings by Mantha Zannakoupi (Institute of Historical Research of the National Hellenic Research Foundation/Birmingham) has focused on the Stadion District (Zarmakoupi 2013a). Her comprehensive architectural analysis of the houses of Delos has shown that a large number of adapt able spaces were gradually created to accommodate shops, workshops, spaces for storage and, quite pos sibly, rooms to be rented out. For example, the ground floor of the House of the Seals ('Maison des Sceaux', GD 59D; Fig. 124) in the Lake District, which was originally organized according to the tradi tional scheme of oecus maior and oecus minor (for these terms, see Chamonard 1922: 168-76; Triimper 1998: 17-18; Zarmakoupi 2013b), was subsequently enlarged and remodelled to accommodate a shop and a workshop at its eastern side (Fig. 129). In addition, the western part of the house, which provided access to the upper floor, underwent some reorganization to create groups of rooms that could have been rented out in order to run a separate business. Based on the architectural analysis of the House of the Seals, it has proved possible to identify houses that present analogous reorganizations of their ground floors: for example House ID in the Stadion District (GD 79; Figs 124,130). In other cases, the original architectural 120 | Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="121">Hellenistic &amp; Roman Delos: the city &amp; its emporion W j! \ \ _ //cd:^\\\ \J,\ ZM-IT ÎFnH ✓ λ ·'/ Ύ-J \\ \ Upper street àfthé\Theatre λ, 7\ K+-1 - 1 / mm \ΒνΛ Μη?»· r^~ Γ 127.

An architectural analysis of the houses points to a combination of commerce and luxury. Thus we might find a luxurious residence above a ground floor that accommodated economic activities: for example the House of the Seals in the Lake District and House ID in the Stadion District. The houses in which this combination was noted belonged to Italian merchants. This combination of commerce with luxury is a well-known Roman architectural strategy, attested in houses and villas in Italy, where luxurious spaces were combined with agricultural activities. In this way, the houses of Italian merchants at Delos provide an early example of the combination of elegance and economic activities with which we are familiar from slightly later examples in Italy (Zarmakoupi forthcoming a; forthcoming b). To this end, the study of domestic settings has shown that owners adapted and transformed the organ ization of houses in order to create new spatial arrangements that could generate profit in the dynamic urban economy of the island in this period. While the main harbour area accommodated the operation of the entrepôt of Delos, a network of economic activities, such as local manufacturers producing small scale goods that could complement the main shiploads, was integrated within the residential neighbour hoods. The studies of Monika Triimper and Karvonis have suggested that the architecture of commercial buildings on Delos corresponds to developments taking place in Republican Italy (Triimper 2005; Karvonis 2008; see discussion in Mayer 2012: 34-41). For example, shops and workshops were walled off from private houses and their upper floors were accessible through separate entrances from the street and could be let separately. The analysis of the houses examined in the ANR programme shows that analogous devel opments can be noted in private architecture. The development of Delian domestic architecture provides a parallel for the systematic integration of shops and workshops within domestic settings attested in exam ples from Pompeii and Herculaneum (Zarmakoupi forthcoming b). Agora of Theophrastos (EfA) The study of the Agora of Theophrastos (GD 49; Figs 124,125) by Jean-Charles Moretti and Myriam Fincker (EfA/Institut de recherche sur l'architecture antique, Centre national de la recherche scientifique) has focused on a circular structure at the western edge of the agora (ID1369) which is now submerged in the sea (Figs 124,131). The agora was in fact named after the epimeletes Theophrastos, who oversaw the completion of the construction works of the landfill just before 126/5 BC (ID1645). The circular structure was the place where slaves, together with other commodities, were sold. The inscription at the entrance to this structure informs us that Sokrates, an agoranomos active around 100 BC, installed this circular structure, a kyklos (κύκλος; ID1835; Moretti et al. 2012: 230-34). The inscription was written on two blocks, placed to the left and right of the entrance to the structure. The right block (no. 2) was first pub lished by Pierre Roussel (1908: 420, no. 13bis), who also published the entire inscription in 1916 (Roussel 1916 [1987]: 184). According to later sources, this building was used for auctions of slaves, as well as of other commodities (Chankowski in Moretti et al. 2012: 237-41). Merchandise was placed in the centre of this circular structure and interested individuals could place a bid. Thus slaves as well as other merchandise could be brought ashore in small groups, sold in the kyklos and then put back on board a ship. This area must have been the location of the Athenian Agoranomion, the office regulating the transactions of the agora, as numerous inscriptions of agoranomoi, dating from 156 BC down to 90 BC, have been found in this area (Moretti et al. 2012: 241^45). The kyklos of Sokrates offers an alternative place for the slave market on Delos; a lot of ink has been spilled on the alleged use of the Agora of the Italians (GD 52; Fig. 124) as a slave market (Cocco 1970; Coarelli 1982; 2005; contra Bruneau 1975; 1985; 1987: 331-39; Rauh 1992; 1993: 81-83,289-338, who argue that it was an arena for sporting events; for recent reviews of all the arguments, see Mastino 2008; Triimper 2008: 93-98; 2009). Triimper has recently (2008: 3-9,93-98; 2009: 34-49) argued convincingly that the Agora of the Italians was not a slave market, but rather a luxurious, park-like building, with a Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 123</page><page sequence="124">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 propylon, garden, double-storeyed porticoes, statue niches and a lavish bath suite (on its honorific statues, see Triimper 2014; as well as the forthcoming study by Frédéric Herbin in the context of the ANR/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft programme EIKON: http://www.eikon-anrdfg.eu/?page_id=273). Further work is currently being conducted in the area of the Agora of Theophrastos, focusing on the base of Menodoros that stood in its northeastern corner. Menodoros was a renowned wrestler and pancra tiast towards the end of the second century BC. Nathan Badoud (EfA/Fribourg), Jean-Charles Moretti and Myriam Fincker have undertaken an analysis of the inscriptions on the base of Menodoros and of the posi tion of the monument in the agora (BCH 135 [2011] 588). Underwater survey (EMA/Institute ofHistorical Research of the National Hellenic Research Foundation) The first underwater survey around the island was conducted in 2014 and 2015 by Mantha Zarmakoupi (Institute of Historical Research of the National Hellenic Research Foundation/Birmingham) and Mag dalini Athanasoula (EMA) under the direction of Ageliki Simosi (EMA) (Fig. 132). The underwater survey was initiated as part of the study by Mantha Zarmakoupi of the urban development of the Late Hellenistic city of Delos (http://urbanetworks.wordpress.com), funded by the Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship scheme (FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF, no. PIEF-GA-2012-331969) and hosted by the Institute of Historical Research of the National Hellenic Research Foundation. The project is a synergasia between the Institute of Historical Research of the National Hellenic Research Foundation and the EMA. The underwater survey focused on one of the neighbourhoods and port installations that were created in the northeastern part of the island, the Stadion District (GD 79; Fig. 124), at the height of Delos' period of urbanization. The survey covered the submerged areas of the neighbourhood that stretches from the Synagogue (GD 80; Fig. 124) to just north of Agia Kyriaki. The Cyclades have seen a sea-level rise of about 2m over the last 2,000 years, engulfing many areas of the heavily urbanized island of Delos. The Stadion District was chosen for the project because it is one of the few areas that has not been disturbed by recent developments, unlike much of the western side of the island and the central harbour. The submerged structures of the central harbour of Delos have suffered irreversible changes, as the 19th- and 20th-century excavators deposited their archaeological rubble on the sea floor and new port installations were constructed over it. The Stadion District is one of the few areas where we can study the seafront of the city in order to understand the integration of Delian trading activities with the urban fabric. The survey located the remains of a building with at least five rooms, located along the shoreline and enclosed between two streets. The building starts at the shore and extends 30m inland, at a depth of about 1.5-2m. In the past, these remains have been identified as port facilities (Papageorgiou-Venetas 1981: 106), but the survey clarified that they are in fact the submerged remains of the Stadion District, forming its east ward limit towards the sea. The building is roughly 30m χ 30m, which is similar to the size of the shops on the seafront on the western side of the island, which have average dimensions of 37m χ 57m. In two of the spaces of the building, clusters of amphorae were found embedded within beachrock formations. One space has 18 pots at a depth of 1.5-2m (Fig. 132, STR-1) and the second has 15 pots at a depth of 0.7m, demon strating that these spaces were used for storage. Parts of plain column shafts were also found (Fig. 132, C1-C6), which were probably part of the colonnade of the building. In addition, the remains of large stone plinths that formed the eastern breakwater of the Stadion District were located just to the south of the eastern end of the building. The building must therefore have been located at the eastern edge of the Stadion District along the ancient coastline, which was artificially formed (Zarmakoupi and Athanasoula forthcoming). The identification of a building associated with commercial activities so close to the ancient shoreline is an important discovery that assists our understanding of the Delian emporion. Studies have focused so far on the area of the main harbour. The Stadion District was hitherto considered a kind of suburb, since it seems now to be cut off from the western side of the island. The discoveries made during the underwater investigation of the Stadion District prove that this area was very similar in character to the main harbour area and was an integral part of the Delian emporion. It appears that a second commercial harbour operated in this area and complemented the activities of the central harbour of Delos in the western part of the island. It is possible 124 | Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="125">Hellenistic &amp; Roman Delos: the city &amp; its emporion 132.

The harbour of the Stadion District could therefore accommodate the victualling of ships on this side of the island, before or after the loading of their cargo at the marble quarry. To date, researchers have focused on the central harbour of Delos, envisaging the main harbour area of Delos as the place where the Delian emporion operated. The underwater survey suggests, however, that we need to consider and research beyond the central harbour area, in the eastern portion of the island as well as in adjacent Rheneia, whose cemetery extends from just opposite the main harbour area from Cape Ghlaropounda to the bay of Kato Generate (Map 9). In conclusion, the operation of the port-city of Delos is still not entirely understood, but the underwater investigation on the northeastern side of Delos is begin ning to provide a new picture of the ways in which the Delian emporion and its harbours operated. The city of Delos in the Hellenistic and Roman periods Beyond the operation of the Delian emporion, recent investigations have also shed light on the architecture, infrastructure and growth of the city of Delos, as well as on the development of its sanctuaries in the Hel lenistic and Roman periods. In addition, the recent publication of a new atlas of Delos (ID704, ID705, ID728, ID846) has provided an indispensable research tool. Sanctuaries in the Hellenistic and Roman periods The development of the several sanctuaries in the Hellenistic and Roman periods has been the subject of numerous field projects in recent years. These include an examination of the Sanctuary of Apollo (ID700, ID701, ID726, ID842, ID1366) and the Artemision (GD 46; Figs 124,125), the excavation of the Aphro dision of Stesileos (Fig. 124; ID654, ID703, ID844, ID1953, ID3404) and the excavation of Serapieion A (GD 91; Fig. 124) and Serapieion Β (GD 96; Fig. 124; ID4768). The study of the Sanctuary of Apollo (Fig. 125) directed by Roland Etienne (EfA/Paris 1) (ID700, ID701, ID726, ID842, ID1366) will result in a forthcoming publication in the Exploration Archéologique de Délos series, including an examination of the sanctuary in the Late Hellenistic, Roman and Early Christian periods by Enora Le Quéré, as well as an investigation of the votive monuments within the sanctuary in the Hel lenistic and Roman periods by Frédéric Herbin (Herbin 2010). The bases of votive statues along the dromos leading to the Propylaia (GD 5; Fig. 125) of the Sanctuary of Apollo have also been the subject of recent analyses that address the political, social and spatial dynamics of honorific practices in the Hellenistic and Roman periods (Dillon and Palmer Baltes 2013; Griesbach 2013; Krumeich 2015). Furthermore, a study of the architectural development of the Artemision (GD 46; Figs 124,125) by Jean-Charles Moretti (EfA/Insti tut de recherche sur l'architecture antique, Centre national de la recherche scientifique) has analysed the ways in which the Archaic temple was incorporated within the Hellenistic temple (Moretti 2012: 427-37). Serapieia A and Β (GD 91, 96; Fig. 124) are currently being re-examined by Hélène Brun (EfA/Paris Sorbonne) in order to clarify their phases of construction from the Hellenistic to the Imperial period (ID4768). In addition, study of the Aphrodision of Stesileos (GD 88; Fig. 124) by Cécile Durvye (EfA/Aix en-Provence) has included excavation to clarify the chronology of the sanctuary and its eastern extension, as well as the changes that it underwent from the period of independence to the Imperial age, when the aqueduct was constructed (ID654, ID703, ID844, ID1953, ID3404). Activities at the sanctuaries of Delos in the Hellenistic and Roman periods have informed recent studies of religious syncretism on the island (see Barrett 2011), as well as of the religious networks in which Delos was embedded (see Collar 2013). Study of their development will illuminate the ways in which these sanctuaries were adapted to meet the needs of Delian society and the kinds of connections that reli gious authorities developed beyond Delos. Recent studies of the religious associations on Delos have shown the ways in which they were employed by the inhabitants of the island in the construction of their identity (Triimper 2006; 2011a; forthcoming). 126 | Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="127">Hellenistic &amp; Roman Delos: the city &amp; its emporion Urbanism and domestic architecture of Hellenistic and Roman Delos Several projects have focused on the urban fabric of Hellenistic and Roman Delos, exploring its water and sanitation infrastructure, the arrangements of its houses, the modalities of its urban growth and its social organization. Specific topics addressed include the water distribution of the city, the latrines on the island (ID4770), the House of Fourni (GD 124; Map 9, Fig. 124; ID1367, ID1954, ID3405, ID4769), the Wall of Triarius (GD 69; Figs 122,124,127; ID1955, ID2641, ID4771) and the development of the city over time. Study of the water distribution of Delos by Jean-Charles Moretti and Myriam Fincker (AfA/Institut de recherche sur l'architecture antique, Centre national de la recherche scientifique) has focused on the barrage of the Inopos river (GD 97; Fig. 124) and the aqueducts of Delos. The Inopos, which is the main river of Delos, springs to the southwest of Kynthos. It first flows north and then turns west towards the Agora of the Competaliasts (GD 2; Fig. 124). A dam connected with a huge retaining basin was constructed in the Classical period, at the point where it changes direction. The monument was studied in the context of a project directed by Michèle Brunei on water facilities on Delos (on the programme, see BCH 125 [2001] 620-27; 126 [2002] 546; 127 [2003]: 516-24). During investigation of the monument in 2003, an inscribed stele was found, reused in the staircase leading into the basin (Siard 2006), and this prompted the re-examination of the dating of the monument. The study showed that the dam and its basin were refurbished at the beginning of the period of Delian independence and that is was connected to an aqueduct in the Imperial period (Fincker and Moretti 2007). The study of water systems on Delos has revealed that, while the vast majority of water projects on the island aimed to preserve and grant access to the groundwater and rainwater stored in cisterns, as well as to the dam on the Inopos river (GD 97), piped water systems were also developed. Two water networks with basins were developed in the periphery of the Sanctuary of Apollo in the Hellenistic period, while an aqueduct, with associated water towers used for storage and distribution, was built on the island in the third century AD (Moretti and Fincker 2011). The construction of an aqueduct in the Roman period, when the population of the island is supposed to have been very small, prompts a reconsideration of activities on the island at that time. A study of the latrines of Delos is currently being conducted by Alain Bouet (EfA/Toulouse 2). The study focuses on 94 structures on the island and involves a photogrammetric survey of them, a palaeop arasitological analysis and pollen analysis, as well as analysis of marine microbiology. Among the aims of the project is the intention to comprehend the factors underpinning the spread of parasitic diseases on Delos (ID4770). The project will complement the earlier analysis of the layout and socio-cultural signif icance of latrines on Delos by Monika Triimper (2011b), who has investigated the public function of latrines within domestic settings. The excavation of the House of Fourni (GD 124; Fig. 124, cf. Map 9; ID1367, ID1954, ID3405, ID4769), under the direction of Hélène Wurmser (EfA/Lyon 2), has included an investigation of its mosaics and overall internal organization, as well as close study of the southern zone of the house, which was used for agricultural activities and operated independently from the main house area. This combi nation, yet separation, of a luxurious house and areas dedicated to agricultural activities is reminiscent of similar arrangements in the villas of Early Republican and Imperial Italy. It is possible that the House of Fourni presents an early example of a villa in Greece. The combination of profit with luxury is a well known Roman architectural strategy and has also been attested, albeit in a different form, in other houses on Delos (see above, ANR research programme on storage spaces; Zarmakoupi forthcoming a;forth coming b). A study of the fortification built by the legate Gaius Valerius Triarius in AD 69 to protect the city of Delos from the pirate Athenodoros (GD 69; Figs 122,124,127) is being conducted by Stephanie Maillot (EfA/Clermont-Ferrand) and Myriam Fincker (EfA/Institut de recherche sur l'architecture antique, Centre national de la recherche scientifique) in preparation for its publication (ID1955, ID2641, ID4771). The general layout of the fortification is approximately known and four sections have been recognized with certainty. The first is 13.2m long and extends from the western wall of the Granite Palaestra (GD 66) in Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015 | 127</page><page sequence="128">Archaeology in Greece 2014-2015 a northwesterly direction (69.1 in Fig. 124, Fig. 125). A second segment extends from the southern wall of the Granite Palaestra to the building located behind the Altar of Dionysos (69.2 in Fig. 124, Fig. 125). This incorporated the walls of existing buildings (the Palaestra of the Lake [GD 70], the so-called Temple of Anios [GD 68] and the Temple 'du bastion') and was originally 215m long (35m are preserved) (Fig. 125). This part of the fortification served to protect the city from attackers who might land in the exposed harbour of the Stadion District. A third, 36m-long segment is preserved southwest of the city and south of the Agora of the Competaliasts, extending towards the sea (69.3 in Fig. 124, Fig. 127). A fourth segment of 45m (69.4 in Fig. 124), running east-west, has been identified on the hill of the theatre and is related to two quadrangular bastions. An architectural study was made of the first three segments (ID1955, ID2641) and two sections were opened at the northern and southern ends of the fourth, to obtain a clearer understanding of the way in which the fortification was constructed (ID4771). The southern segment of the wall imposes itself on the Delian landscape. Its construction was evidently strategic. It could block invasions from the southwest, it overlooked the Inopos valley to the east and, more impor tantly, enabled the monitoring of maritime activities from Naxos to the south, Mykonos to the east and Tenos to the north. Furthermore, the construction of the wall and its two bastions on the hill of the theatre was meant to create an imposing view when seen from afar, so as to deter possible attacks. The definitive research tool for the study of Delos, L'Atlas de Délos (Fig. 124), was published in 2015 in the Exploration archéologique de Délos monograph series of the EfA (volume 43; Moretti et al. 2015) and in a collaboration between the EfA and the Institut de recherche sur l'architecture antique of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique. The new atlas is the result of a thorough survey of the island, and of all the ancient buildings that have been discovered, conducted between 2004 and 2011 by Jean-Charles Moretti, Lionel Fadin, Myriam Fincker and Véronique Picard (ID704, ID705, ID728, ID846). The pub lication presents a plan of the island at a scale of 1:5,000, general plans of the city at scales of 1:2,000 and 1:1,000, and plans of all the monumental complexes at a scale of 1:200. The atlas will shortly be available in a GIS form, enabling the results of new excavations to be incorporated into it (Briquet 2012). Finally, a study of the urban development of Delos, entitled UrbaNetworks (https://urbanetworks.word press.com/), is currently being undertaken by Mantha Zarmakoupi (Institute of Historical Research of the National Hellenic Research Foundation/Birmingham). UrbaNetworks was originally funded by the Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship scheme (FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF, no. PIEF-GA-2012-331969) and hosted by the Institute of Historical Research of the National Hellenic Research Foundation (April 2013 to March 2015), and is now funded by the University of Birmingham. Focusing on the four main residential neighbourhoods of the Late Hellenistic city of Delos, it examines urban development in relation to eco nomic change. By analysing the transformation of the residential neighbourhoods of Delos in relation to manufacturing activities, shopping and storage facilities, as well as the construction of public buildings, the project examines the neighbourhoods as microcosms of the broader changes which Delos underwent during the Late Hellenistic period. Conclusion The study of Hellenistic and Roman Delos and its emporion has profited from two recent developments in the disciplines of the archaeology and ancient history of Greece. On the one hand, the burgeoning study of ancient economies has led to a re-examination of the modalities of economic activities, in search of a more sophisticated model for understanding the operation of Delian commerce (see Duchêne 1993) beyond the typological models of substantivism versus modernism. On the other hand, an increasing interest in Roman Greece, expressed in seminars (such as the Roman Seminar in Athens), conferences and accompanying publications (for example Rizakis and Touratsoglou 2013), and research projects on the history, archaeology and epigraphy of the period (for example by the Section of Greek and Roman Antiquity [formerly KERA] of the Institute of Historical Research of the National Hellenic Research Foundation: http://www.eie.gr/nhrf/institutes/igra/southerngreeceprog-en.html), has laid the intellectual foundations for contextualizing Hellenistic and Roman Delos, and its emporion, within a canvas of broader historical developments. 128 | Archaeological Reports for 2014-2015</page><page sequence="129">Hellenistic &amp; Roman Delos: the city &amp; its emporion Bibliography Barrett, C.E.
