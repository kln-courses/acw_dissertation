McCormick Ideally, studies of international relations should explore the relations between a given society's domestic changes and concurrent changes in the international system. Contemporary historians of American foreign relations, however, have generally invested more energy in debating the relative primacy of internal and ex- ternal than in articulating their connectedness.1 Was the Cold War, for example, the outgrowth of internal American economic need, domestic political constraints, ex- ceptionalist ideology, or race thinking; or was it a response to the external realities of Soviet expansionism, global insecurity, or postwar economic chaos? Was the United States to blame itself for the Cold War, or to lay that guilt at the feet of some other? In that sometimes either/or context, the internal dynamic has received the greater and more imaginative attention. The external context has often been intuited and assumed, rather than specified and analyzed. Many historians have seemed more concerned with American perceptions of the international system than with the system as such. Did American leaders and the American people properly understand that system, its imperatives, and the place of the United States in it? If they did, they were approvingly deemed "realists"; if they did not they were denigrated as "idealists." Fifteen years ago, however, Immanuel Wallerstein's The Modern World-System exploded a conceptual bombshell whose shock waves have belatedly reached the study of American foreign relations. The result has been renewed scholarly interest in the international system, but in a system very different from the traditional inter- state system of national actors, geopolitical imperatives, and balance of power. Much influenced by Fernand Braudel's monumental works on early capitalism, Wallerstein posited the existence since 1500 of a world system or capitalist world economy. Its chief actors have been transnational business organizations and operations, driven by the premise that capitalism functioned most efficiently and thus most profitably when its universe of options was sufficiently large and fluid for capital, goods, ser- vices, and people to move from one place to another to secure greater returns, even if that place was both distant and foreign. Its chief process was the spatial expansion of European capitalism at the expense of autarkic empires in Russia, China, and the Near East, as well as the subsistence, village minisystems of eastern Europe, Ireland, the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Its chief consequence was a system of three successive Thomas J. McCormick is professor of history, University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Core countries (the First World) monopolize high-tech, high-profit enterprises. The periphery (the Third World) specializes in primary production of agricultural commodities and raw materials: "hewers of wood and car- riers of water." In between, the semiperiphery (the Second World) performs inter- mediate functions of transport, local capital mobilization, and less complex, less profitable forms of manufacturing.2 World systems theory, also called systemic theory, was an interesting hybrid of two competing developmental theories-dependency and modernization (a mix that generated ideological displeasure on both the right and the left). It shared with the former most of its basic premises and its emphasis on the uneven and exploit- ative nature of capitalist development. Popularized by revolutionary Third World nationalism and anti-imperialism in the 1960s and early 1970s, dependency theory had argued that the development of "rich lands" and the underdevelopment of "poor lands" were symbiotic, that the latter was a structural-outgrowth of the needs of the former. Systemic theory largely accepted and built on that perspective. Even when dependency theory came under increasing attack in the late 1970s and 1980s, proponents of world systems analysis continued to argue its applicability for the Less Developed Countries (LDCs) in the Caribbean basin, most of Africa, and much of Southeast Asia.3 It also suggested that the Newly Industrializing Countries of the semiperiphery (NICs) had achieved only "dependent development," based on bor- rowed money, whose consequence was the international debt trap, and borrowed technology, whose time lag limited development to less profitable product lines being discarded by core countries as they moved to more profitable high-tech sectors. On the other hand, systemic theorists parted company with dependencia in some fundamental ways. In echoes of modernization theory, they expressed skepticism about the ability of revolutionary regimes in the periphery to plan and implement programs of autonomous, autarkic industrialization. Undersized production runs for undersized local markets were inherently inefficient and likely to fail. Similarly, its treatment of the industrializing semiperiphery suggested that specialized pro- duction for the world market, like that of market economies in the Pacific rim, was more successful than diversified production for the internal market, like that of import-substitution economies in South America or planned economies in Eastern Europe. Moreover, its concession that mobility from semiperiphery to core had been historically possible for a select few, like the United States and Japan, implied that similar mobility might be possible for a few countries now on the semiperiphery, such as China and Brazil. The treatment of internecine relations between great powers in world systems theory has been stimulating and unsettling. Its emphasis renders political-military 2 Immanuel Wallerstein, The Modern World-System: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century (New York, 1974). 3 See Steve J.

Never fond of cosmic theories that obscure the discrete and specific, historians have been especially unhappy with what appears to be the static and reductionist quality of this approach. World systems theory seems to endow its sub- ject with an anthropomorphic quality, so that systemic imperatives of capital ac- cumulation and profit making- expressions more of process than of tangible struc- tures -acquire a kind of logic and quasi consciousness. Systemic theory also seems to endow its subject with a certain omniscience and near omnipotence. Individual nation-states, such as Napoleonic France or Nazi Germany, might attempt to divide the world into fragmented power blocs; and revolutionary regimes, such as the So- viet Union or the People's Republic of China, might attempt either to remake the system or to opt out of it altogether; but the economic logic of the world system requires that the market economy become global and integrated: a free world; one world. All such deviant ventures by individual nation-states, while hardly irrelevant, are nonetheless doomed to failure in the long run. In humankind's historical saga of winners and losers, the system always wins. Only when capitalism reaches its spa- tial limits and class conflict becomes globalized will the losers have their temporal moment.4 The criticisms of world systems theory pinpoint real or potential weaknesses in making the model relevant for historians. The weaknesses, however, are far from fatal. In the first place, they do not obviate the central truth of world systems anal- ysis. There is an extant economic system driven by the aggregate actions of private economic actors engaged in the process of capital accumulation and labor exploita- tion; it possesses a logic that is inherently internationalist; and it coexists in uneasy tension with the political power of individual nation-states and their nationalist biases. Historians who treat the interstate system must also analyze how it interacts with that world economy, and how the two constrain or reinforce each other. For example, Eastern Europe's recent shift toward democratic capitalism dramatically il- lustrates, not merely the strength of domestic dissent, but the interconnected attrac- tion of global market forces and consumer culture on one hand and the facilitating power of Soviet-American detente and greater European autonomy on the other. In the second place, the alleged weaknesses of world systems analysis are not in- herent in the model itself. One might choose to concede that world systems analysis, as often practiced, tends to understate and diminish the capacity of classes, races, peoples, and nations to resist core dominance, and that their resistance forces significant modifications in the system. For example, pressure by NICs for a more equitable division of labor in the international economy may have speeded the transfer of manufacturing operations from the core to the semiperiphery. But nothing in the model prevents the portrayal of such facts. The spread of market 4 For a more extended treatment of hegemony, see Thomas McCormick, "'Every System Needs a Center Some- times': An Essay on Hegemony and Modern American Foreign Policy," in Redefing the Past, ed.

For example, the impact of British capital in the nineteenth cen- tury and American capital in the twentieth may have preordained Mexico's eventual integration into a global economy, but the power of the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s profoundly influenced the pace and form of that integration. Wielded in a dynamic, dialectical way, the world systems model seems fully capable of absorbing such complexities. There is ample evidence that world systems theory is not incompatible with inter- state theory. Both systems do exist. They are, however, asymmetrical. One is polit- ical; the other is economic; one's unit of analysis is particularized (the nation-state); the other's is holistic (the world economy); one's spatial boundaries encompass the part of the world organized into nation-states; the other embraces only the part of the world organized according to a capitalist mode of production. Yet their recurring cycles and secular trends do intersect. Those intersections offer scholars the chance to combine insights suggested by world systems theory and interstate theory.5 Per- haps the best example is the contemporary scholarship on hegemony. For historians of American foreign relations, the greatest contribution of world systems analysis is its understanding of hegemony's rise and fall. Building on Braudel's central premise that "each time decentering occurs, a recentering begins," Wallerstein and other like-minded social scientists have attempted both to identify and to explain the cycles of "concentration" and "diffusion" that Brooks Adams de- scribed almost a century ago in his book The Law of Civilization and Decay: that is, the international system's oscillation between unicentric hegemony and polycen- tric balance of power.6 The systemic school of thought defines hegemony as a single power's possession of "simultaneous superior economic efficiency in production, trade and finance." That "superior economic position vis-a-vis competing core states" is the consequence of such historical variables as technological innovation, resources, flexible and sup- portive state structures, superior geography (especially that of sea powers over land powers), entrepreneurially oriented religions, and national ideology.7 The conse- 5 See Ole R. Holsti, "Models of International Relations and Foreign Policy," Diplomatic History, 13 (Winter 1989), 15-43. Holsti also described a third model, the global society, but it describes a series of related secular trends and tendencies more than a system or structure. 6 For Fernand Braudel's statement, see Thomas J. McCormick, America's Half- Century: United States Foreign Policy in the Cold War (Baltimore, 1989), 1. Many of the systemic theorists, among them Nicole Bousquet, Christopher Chase-Dunn, and Terence Hopkins, are to be found in Wallerstein's many edited anthologies.

Many sys- temic theorists have stressed the role of long-wave economic cycles, especially the downside, in eliminating marginal competitors and elevating the more efficient: for example, the long depression of the late nineteenth century that initiated British decline and American ascendancy and the Great Depression of the 1930s that solidified the process. More recently, some have emphasized the role of lengthy, global wars, whose radical redistribution of systemic power made hegemony pos- sible: for example, the Napoleonic Wars that ushered in the era of Pax Britannica and the two world wars that commenced "America's Half-Century" as hegemon. A single hegemonic power has a built-in incentive to force other nations to abandon their economic nationalism and protectionist controls and to accept a world of free trade, free capital flows, and free currency convertibility. As the world's dominant economic power, a hegemonic nation has the most to gain from such a free world, and the most to lose from nationalist efforts to limit the free movement of capital, goods, and currencies. So the preponderant world power has an unequiv- ocal self-interest in using its economic power as workshop and banker of the free world to create institutions and ground rules that foster the internationalization of capital. It finds it inherently advantageous to use its political power as ideologue of the world system to preach the universal virtues of freedom of the seas, free trade, Open Door policies, comparative advantage, and a specialized division of labor. It finds it necessary to use its military power as global policeman to protect the interna- tional system against external antagonists, internal rebellions, and internecine differences. Great Britain and the United States did so in the nineteenth and twen- tieth centuries respectively. The chief consequence of hegemony is to soften the contradiction between the internationalist imperatives of the economic world system and the nationalist rival- ries and autarkic tendencies of the geopolitical interstate system. Witness most re- cently the ability of the hegemonic United States to create the Bretton Woods multi- lateral monetary system, to move Europe and a reintegrated Germany toward an economically more viable common market, to use force in the Korean and Vietnam wars to salvage the Pacific rim and facilitate Japanese reindustrialization, to nudge the Third World away from neo-mercantilism and import substitution to special- ized production for the world market, and in general to make the world economy more unitary and interdependent. The result was a golden age of capitalism be- tween 1950 and 1973 that perhaps witnessed the highest sustained, global rate of aggregate profit in capitalism's half-millennium history: an era so prosperous that its chief beneficiaries, the great core states, saw no need to use war as a means of redistributing global resources and wealth.8 Hegemony carries within it the seeds of its own economic destruction. Great Britain discovered that fact, and so now does the United States. The twin functions 8 See John Lewis Gaddis, The Long Peace: Inquiries into the History of the Cold War (New York, 1987).</page><page sequence="6">130 The Journal of American History June 1990 of the hegemon as global banker and global policeman lead it to overinvest in multi- national ventures abroad and in military production at home. It becomes easier and more profitable to live off one's overseas dividends and rents (to become a rentier economy) and off state-subsidized military contracts (to become a warfare economy) than to sustain high investment levels in the civilian industrial sector, and the conse- quent deindustrialization initiates a relative economic decline. That helps slow the global economy, and the hegemon's competitors - less burdened by military demands - use the slowdown to wrest additional market shares from their less efficient patron. In the end, the dominant core power faces a catch-22 situation. If it sustains the high-level military spending necessary to carry out its global policing, it neglects civilian research and development, distorts its economy, and reduces its capacity to compete in world markets. On the other hand, if it cuts mili- tary spending to restore civilian productivity and trade competitiveness, it dimin- ishes its role as global protector of a capitalist free world. It becomes less efficient in containing or confronting the system's enemies or in forcing its friends to depend on its protection and therefore to defer to its rules for the game. Hegemony neces- sarily rests on both military and economic power, and the dilemma facing a maturing hegemon is that it cannot sustain both. Such is the nature of world system dynamics, and both the British experience after 1870 and the American experience after 1970 provide ample evidence to support its plausibility.9 Such systemic theories of hegemony both contest with and complement so-called realist theories that emerged in the 1980s. Though it avoids the use of the term he- gemony and its theories are largely implicit, Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of Great Powers is the most visible of such realist studies. More explicit are the works of Robert Gilpin and David Calleo.10 These realist interpretations approach the dy- namics of hegemony-of the waves of stability and instability, of centralization and decentralization -from the vantage point of the interstate system. Their chief actors are nation-states and nation-state coalitions, and the states' main imperative is the maximization of geopolitical power in a global zero-sum game. This will to power knows only the limits imposed by a nation's internal resources and the ability of other nations or coalitions to resist that will. Gilpin, for example, hypothesizes that any nation will continue to expand its power until it reaches a point where the liabil- ities of continued expansion overweigh the gains. Periodically, a single nation de- velops such total power - defined in military and political as well as economic terms -that it has the near omnipotence to impose much of its will on the whole interstate system. The hegemon does so to sustain a status quo from which it benefits. Over time, the mounting costs of maintaining that status quo, com- pounded by the competition of ascending states expanding toward their outer limits (their pain-gain equilibrium), force the paramount power to diminish its military role or experience economic decline. 9 See Nigel Harris, Of Bread and Guns: The World Economy in Crisis (Middlesex, England, 1983). 10 Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000 (New York, 1987); David Calleo, The Imperious Economy (Cambridge, Mass., 1982); David Calleo, BeyondAmer- ican Hegemony: The Future of the Western Alliance (New York, 1987); Robert Gilpin, War and Change in World Politics (New York, 1981); Robert Gilpin, The Political Economy of International Relations (Princeton, 1987).</page><page sequence="7">World Systems 131 The realist approach to hegemony and the international system differs from sys- temic approaches in several key respects. Perhaps the most salutary has been the realists' definition of hegemonic power as total rather than exclusively economic. In particular, the realist emphasis on military power as intrinsic to hegemony has en- couraged systemic theorists to see large-scale war, and its redistribution of global power, as a key catalyst for hegemony's ascent. The more substantive disagreements between realist and systemic schools about the importance of economic forces are more difficult to resolve. Systemic theories, for all their flaws, treat those forces in a dynamic, historical way. Their treatments of economic forces have concrete histor- ical actors - Braudel's "long-distance" entrepreneurs and today's multinational cor- porations. They have process -the accumulation of capital and the maximization of profits. And they have systemic consequences - a world economy whose medium- term existence ebbs and flows cyclically but whose long-term, secular tendency is to expand and encompass the globe. Realist treatments of economic power are more static. Economic power is merely a tool of expanding national influence; it is not a dynamic cause. Economic gain is merely part of a general aggrandizement pursued by all nations if they can get away with it, but it has no relation to business cycles, contesting economic theories, or the rate of profit. Economic force is the determined by-product of the available resource base and the given level of technology, rather than the contested consequence of competing ideologies and interest groups making concrete choices about economic strategies (for example, income redistribu- tion for a protected domestic market versus expanded production for an open world market).1" In realist hands, economics is a factor, but never a system. Capitalism, for example, is essentially a nonword and a nonconcept in Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of Great Powers. "You may be right in African terms," said Henry Kissinger to a corporate critic of his Angolan policy in 1976, "but I am thinking globally."12 So too must scholars of America's foreign relations. From its colonial beginnings, America served as a political-military battleground for the European interstate system and as an in- tegrated, spatial extension of European capitalism. The Republic itself was born in an unstable, war-ridden international system, poised on the brink of global war and of Britain's ascent to global hegemony, and at a time when a stagnating world economy was primed to expand so explosively that the United States's share of its export and reexport profits would bring within its grasp economic independence as well as political autonomy. From that moment to this, the transformation of the United States from colony to colossus -from periphery to semiperiphery to core to hegemon -was not simply the linear product of domestic dynamics, but the dialec- tical consequence of external constraints and demands from the international 11 See Fred L. Block, The Origins of International Economic Disorder (Berkeley, 1977); and Charles S. Maier, Recasting Bourgeois Europe: Stabilization in France, Germany, and Italy in the Decade after World War I (Princeton, 1975). 12 New York Times, March 14, 1976, sec. E, p. 15.</page><page sequence="8">132 The Journal of American History June 1990 system. Never isolated, always integrated, the spatial expansion, economic develop- ment, and political nation building of the United States would be powerfully influenced and partly determined by the long waves of economic expansion and contraction and the global division of economic labor, and by the long swings of political centralization and decentralization and the global rhythms of stability and instability. Recognizing the conjunctures and disjunctures of the interstate and world sys- tems enormously facilitates our analysis of American foreign affairs. Witness, for example, the period of American hegemony that coincides with the Cold War epoch since the end of World War II. The global unit of analysis helps overcome our often myopic preoccupation with Soviet-American relations and locates them inside a larger framework. The stress on long-term time and long-term process helps divest the Cold War of its mystique of uniqueness, so we can view it as part of the historical cycle of centering, decentering, and recentering that has been a patterned feature of the global system. The appreciation of hegemony as a rare yet recurring phenomenon of the system helps us understand, for example, the historical impera- tives that led to the fight by the United States, as hegemon, to keep Southeast Asia inside the global market economy, less to serve the nation's own marginal interests than to serve the major interests ofJapan and the larger systemic interests of world capitalism. Conversely, the awareness of hegemony's structurally derived imperma- nence makes it easier to view the contemporary decline of the United States in a comparative framework (for example, in comparison with the Britain of a century ago), and to understand more keenly the essential paradox of hegemony: Decades of playing global policeman weaken the economic underpinnings of hegemony it- self. "Peace requires hegemony or balance of power," said the ever quotable Dr. Kis- singer in 1988. "We have neither the resources nor the stomach for the former. The only question is how much we have to suffer before we realize this."13 13 McCormick, America's Half-Century, 216.</page></plain_text>
