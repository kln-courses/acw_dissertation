It is impossible to commence in the "Face." The Face is for- bidden, concealed, absent, thus absented. In the absence of the Face of the Invisible, the Unseen, the Qur'an begins in the Name. In the absence of the Face, the Name casts a long and enduring shadow on the literariness of the Faith, on the concealing of the Face, on the substitution of a collection of Sacred Signatures for a constellation of Signs, on the collapsing of the Sign into the Sig- nifier, so that it can point, ipso facto, to a Signified, and thus to implicate One Final Transcendental Signified, the Hermeneutic Center and Circle that hold the universe of the Qur'anic imagi- nation together.

Where the Face is de-Faced, the Sacred Signature sealed, the Sign mutated, the Signifier born, the Signified suggested, and the Transcendental Signified implicated: There is a story, inevitably in a Signed Language, waiting, inevitably, to be told. The inaugural moment of the absence of the Face is in the inau- gural Text of the Faith, the Sacred Constitution and the aggressive repression of the absence, of and in the word ghayab (the Unseen, the Absent). Alif. Lâm. Mîm. This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who ward off (evil). Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that We have bestowed upon them; And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter. - The Qur'an 2:1-4 . . .

The inaugural moment of the Qur'an, of Re-Citation, is alpha- betical Audible, inarticulate, visible, meaning-held-at-bay, alpha- bet: Alif. Lâm. Mîm mean nothing. Signatures, though, authoritative. Letters coagulating to no word. Pseudo-Signs announcing themselves. Signifiers signifying nothing beyond their visuality. Signifiers feigning the Sign. Alif. Lâm. Mîm are the optical illusions of Signs precisely at the moment when they are about to suppress the visible absence of the Sign and mutate</page><page sequence="4">130 SOCIAL RESEARCH that absence, and thus that in/ability, into the instrumentality of the Signifier, the Sacred, the alphabetical ordering of access to Truth Manifest. The Truth is about to be Manifest-ed right here where it cannot be Manifest and it must hide its in/ability to be Manifest. Signatures of the Unseen: Alif. Lâm. Mîm are neither Signs nor Signifiers. They are both Signs and Signifiers. In that disabling contradiction is the enabling configuration that makes the Sacred, the aggressive substitution of the suggested Significa- tion for the suppressed Sign, of the meaning of the Name for the shape of the Face, of the Hermeneutics of postponement for the Semiotics of the present, of the Metaphysics of fear for the Aes- thetic of pleasure, possible. "This is the Scripture" (Dhâlik al-Kitâbu) delivers the promise of that visible substitution of the invisible Sign by determinedly collapsing it into a pregnant Signifier, "the Scripture" is actually "the Book," or even more accurately "that which is written," or a collection thereof, and this time has a meaning, the coagulation of a word, The Word. In this inaugural moment of the Faith, in two strategic moves, is hidden the supreme anxiety of the Faith, in the absence of the Face, of the Supreme Transcendental Sig- nified, actively implicated, emplotted, by the mutation of the absent Sign into the present Signifier. The Book is one colossal Signifier, having just successfully concealed its otherwise para- lyzing anxiety of lacking a Face, pointing to a Transcendental Signified. Faith is thus "having no doubt," {la rayba fiht), "whereof there is no doubt," that the Book is "a guidance unto those who ward off (evil)." In two moves, in the first two verses of the inaugurating moment of the Faith, the opening gambit of the optical illusion of alphabetical Signifiers masquerading as Signs while not relenting their Signifying claims deliver the Faithful to the Book, the Written, the Transcendental Signifier, delivering the Truth Manifest at the very throne of the Tran- scendental Signified, the Truth Manifest, decidedly un-manifest- able, the condition of having Faith in the un-Face the very condito sine qua non of Revelation, revealing what cannot be seen, what is un-see-able.</page><page sequence="5">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 131 "This is the Scripture" (Dhâlik al-Kitâbu) can also be read, and has also been read by some early commentators, as predicate on the subject of Alif. Lâm. Mîm, which delivers the visual inarticu- late right to the doorstep of the written articulate, the Sign hand- ing-in, delivering, itself to the Signifier. But even more emphatically, the substitution of the Transcendental Signifier for the absence of the Sign is implanted in the interlink "guidance" (hudan). Hudan, from hdy, is to guide, to point to, to lead, from one thing to another, as from a Signifier to a Signified. Dhâlik al- Kitâbu lã rayba fihî hudan li al-muttaqyn is cataclysmic in its cate- gorical pronouncement, no-time-to-waste conclusion, that the Book, the Written, the promissory notation of the Alphabetical, is undoubtedly the guidance, the linking passage, from-here-to- there, for those who thus believe and are thus Faithful, and are thus guided from (the absence of) the Sign to (the site of) the Signature to (the domain of) the Signifier, right to (the Presence) of the Transcendental Signified, implicated by and in a game far removed from its Sacred Claims. What cannot be seen, the Face of the Unseen, is the defining moment of the Faith-ful, of the Faith. "Who believe in the Unseen" {alladhîna yu'minûna bi al-ghayb) is now confident in its doctrinal announcement, pronouncement, its categorical imper- ative, of who has and who lacks Faith in the absence of the Face. In the Sixth/Twelfth century, Shaykh Abu al-Futûh al-Râzî , sum- ming up and summoning the authority of all his predecessors all the way back to the very father of Qur'anic hermeneutics, Ibn Abbas (d. c. 68/687) , a cousin to the Prophet himself, is emphatic as to what the Unseen refers to: "As for ghayb, it refers to what- ever is hidden from the eyes and yet visible in the hearts." What is it that is Most Hidden from the eye and Most Necessary in the heart? Not just any unseen. The Unseen. Delegated to the heart, itself an organ unseen, the Unseen cannot be seen by the eyes in the face. Because the Unseen cannot be seen by the eyes in our face, because It is Face-less, we are de-Faced. The Faith-ful are thus those who believe in the Unseen, in That which cannot be Seen. The Faith-ful are those who believe in the Face-less, "estab-</page><page sequence="6">132 SOCIAL RESEARCH lishing worship" (wa yuqimûna al-salât), "and spend of that We have bestowed upon them" (wa mimmâ razqnâhum yunfiqûn) are now the qualifying attributes of those who have already moved from the absence of the Face into the Sacred site of the Signature and into the domain of the Transcendental Signifier to be carried forward to the Presence of the Transcendental Signified. The transaction is complete. The Faith is sealed, the Face is hidden. Its absence aufgehoben. The cycle is not complete though. The repressed is momentar- ily returned in the promissory notation of Revelation. What is Rev- elation} Revelation is the return of the repressed in check. "And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that which was revealed before thee" (wa alladhîna yu'minuna bi- ma unzila ilayka wa ma unzila min qablïka) re-constitutes the visible Alphabetical ordering of the Revelation, or bi-ma unzila, "that which comes down," as the Sign Itself, and thus power-bases the author- ity of who is actually in charge, as the Alphabetical Signifier replac- ing the (absence of) the Sign. Though Alphabetical, Revelation is now the "Sign," only analytically and post-scripturally in quotation marks. And it is through Revelation as the Alphabetically manufac- tured "Sign," that the Faith-ful, in the full absence of the Face, "are certain of the Hereafter" (wa bi al-'âkhirati humyûqinûn). Rev- elation is thus in effect Concealment, a cover-up, of a Face that cannot be Seen, and that it is Unseen, because It is Invisible. Rev- elation promises to cover-up the Face of a Face-less Unseen by Speaking on its behalf- Sound for the Sight, Voice for the Vision, an Ear for an Eye. Revelation promises an un-masking by deliver- ing a Re-Citation, the Qur'an. It promises the vision by delivering the voice. Revelation speaks on behalf of an Invisible Face by re- assuring that It is covering-up a Face. Revelation pulls the screen of speech down on a Face that is not there. Revelation is a sound barrier on a non-existent Face: A Sound simulacrum of the Sign. Revelation is the Faith in the Unseen as Revelation: That is the monumental achievement of the Written, of the Book, all in the absence of the Face.</page><page sequence="7">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 133 The Qur'an conceals what cannot be seen and in bright day light calls it the Unseen, and yet calls that act of concealment Revelation. In Revelation, the return of the repressed is repressed. Thus at the very commencement of the Faith we move from the absence of the Sign of the Face unto the presence of the Name of the Unseen, towards the Sacred site of the Signature, the articula- tion of the Signifier, "In the Name," and we begin: "In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful." The Qur'an begins with a fait accompli, "In the Name," and then moves to deliver. In the act of that delivery dwells the inhibition of Seeing, because the Sign is absent, and the Name, as Signifier, has replaced it. Since the Qur'anic Unseen, on Whom the entire Sacred certitude is predi- cated, cannot be seen, then the whole act of seeing is repressed. But since the most markedly identifiable site of seeing is the Face, then the very act of Faith is predicated on the constitutional impossibility of seeing, or showing, the Face of the Unseen. We cannot show because It, the Unseen, cannot be seen. We are not allowed to see because the Unseen cannot be shown. From the sur- Face site of the Absent Face we are then hermeneutically diverted towards the meaning of the Name. The conclusion is foregone: Since the Face of the Unseen cannot be seen, then no figurai rep- resentation is possible precisely because no Face can be repre- sented. Since we cannot see the Unseen, then seeing of no Face is permitted. The very act of seeing is suspect because every time we see a face we are reminded of the Face that cannot be seen. To forget that the Unseen, the promissory Citation of the Re-Citation, cannot be seen, we are not to be reminded of seeing. Qur'anic Re-Citation is one massive act of hermeneutically preg- nant amnesia. The amnesia is made possible not by political imposition but by biological implication. We are implicated in the collective act of amnesia because the absence of the Face of the Unseen is repli- cated in our own inability to see our own Faces - mirrors not-with- standing.3 The thing in the mirror is not the Face. It is always-already a Signifier, mutated by the identity of the person we</page><page sequence="8">134 SOCIAL RESEARCH recognize, and never the sign we behold. Because we cannot see our own Faces, we are implicated and complacent in the violent mutation of the meaning-less Sign into the meaning-full Signifier. We quell the anxiety of not being able to see our own Faces as Sign by aiding and abetting in the colossal mutation of all Signs into Signifiers - in "believing in the Unseen." The result is simple: In the absence of the Face of the Unseen, the Sign is collapsed, significantly mutated, into the Signifier, so that the Signifier can point to the Signified, and so that the whole gambit can implicate a Transcendental Signified Who can in turn hold the whole game together. And that is the origin of the Qur'anic, and with that the Islamic, hermeneutics. The Islamic hermeneutics is categorically predicated on a constitutional mis- trust of the Face-value, of the sur-Face meaning, and the reversal trust in the promises of the Hidden, in the Unseen, in that which is to be dis-covered, un-veiled. And that is the origin of the very idea of hermeneutics, of extracting the Hidden meaning: The Signifier pointing to so many potentially Hidden Signifieds that successfully represses its own permutation of the Sign, of having itself been significantly mutated from a Face Unseen, a Sign stolen. The hermeneutic goose-chase successfully conceals the verbal mutation of the word "goose" from the fat bird itself. The Qur'anic, Re-Cited, Transcendental Signified is soon wedded to the borrowed Aristotelian metaphysics and results in an Islamic theo-ontology that represses and sublimates the Semiotics of the absented Sign into a Metaphysics of the implicated Transcendental Signified and calls it the Wâjib al-Wujûd, the Necessary Being, the hermeneutic condito sine qua non of the Islamic theo-ontology.4 In other words, because Face as the site of Identity is denied the Unseen, because the Unseen cannot be seen, then the Face is juridi- cally forbidden and hermeneutically mis-trusted. Because the Face is the singular site of recognition, identification, distinction, acknowledgment of existence, the hermeneutic apparatus which is built to conceal the absence of the Face always already begins from behind the Face, under the skin, going in the opposite direction of the sur-Face. Because the Face is forbidden, then what we see on the</page><page sequence="9">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 135 Fig. 2 Because we cannot see our faces, we are implicated and complacent in the violent mutation of the meaning-less Sign into the meaning-full Signifier. From the revolutionary iconography of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. sur-Face of the text is considered flawed, diminished, spasmodic. In a hermeneutics that is predicated on the assumption of a Revelation, Face, as the site of vision, and yet the Sight Unseen, is de-Faced. Because the Faith-fill cannot see the Face, the sur-Face is con- demned and its opposite the Depth is celebrated. Celebration of the Depth is the occasion of the hermeneutics of Revelation. The hermeneutics of Revelation is the Qur'anic condition of celebrating</page><page sequence="10">136 SOCIAL RESEARCH the Hidden, the Deep, the Veiled, the Concealed. The active, inevitable, celebration of the Depth is predicated on the narrative postponement of the evidence of the sur-Face to the promise of the Depth, delegating the authority of the sur-Face to the principality of the Hidden. Qur'an, in its Revelatory language, is thus a hermeneu- tics of postponement, from the evidence of the sur-Face to the promise of the Depth, from the Sign to the Signifier, to the Invisi- ble, and all because the Unseen cannot be seen, and the Unseen is the narrative corner-stone of the whole act of Revelation. Because the Unseen cannot be seen then seeing is faulted. The Qur'an must begin "In the Name" because it cannot begin "In the Face," and thus there is a categorical denial of the Sign, a strategic mutation of the Sign into the Signifier, an active implication of The Transcendental Signified, and a universal disposition towards a hermeneutics of postponement: from the Sign (mutated) to the Signature (sighted) to the Signifier (celebrated) to the Signified (implicated). The immediate result of this hermeneutic deferral of the Sign is that Islam, as a Revelatory language, is constitutionally a literal Faith, doctrinally pre-disposed to an excision of the Sign, where the absence of the Sign must be, and is, repressed with the pri- macy of the Signifier. For this reason, Islam must, and does, begin with a Book: "This is the Scripture (al-Kitab) whereof there is no doubt " (The Qur'an: 2:2). The Qur'an, as Re-Citation, swears by the pen and that which it writes: "By the pen and that which they write [therewith] " (The Qur'an: 68:2) . It commands to read in the Name of a God Whom it glorifies for having taught Man by the pen: "Read: In the name of thy Lord Who createth, Createth man from a clot. Read: And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous, Who teacheth by the pen" (The Qur'an: 96: 1-4) .5 The Qur'an must repress the Face, in the Name of the Faith, and opt for a lit- erary turn, precisely because in its literariness it represses and over-compensates for the absence of the Sign, and its mutation into the primacy of the Signifier, at the center of its Revelatory lan- guage, at the gravitational commencement of its cosmogony, for which it cannot produce a visible testimony. The greatest achieve- ment of Islamic hermeneutics, from its rational jurisprudence to</page><page sequence="11">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 137 its speculative theology to its polyvocal philosophical disposition, emerges from this self-conscious moment of its visual contingency on a postponed promise, the presence of an absence. The implication of this hermeneutic concealment of the Face in the realm of the Aesthetics is quite evident. Painting is faulted because every time we see something (on its sur-Face) we are reminded that the Re-Cited Unseen cannot be re-Sighted and seen, that the Unseen is constitutionally denied the most visible, and thus the ultimate, testimonial of Existence. Visuality is denied the Unseen: The Re-Cited can force or feign forgetting but can never forget that. In the Islamic aesthetics, then, it is not so much the painting which is prohibited as the painted shunned. The painted points to the sur-Face and the sur-Face to the Face, and because we cannot see the Face of the Unseen, the defining occasion of the Re-Cited as Revelation, we should then not look at any Face, re-Sight any Sight, because the mere visibility of every Face reminds us of the absence of the One Face, the Face of the Unseen, we cannot, and can never, see. Every Face is reminiscent of what the Re-Cited must forget. And we, Face-less to ourselves, are accomplices, complacent in the act. The story of the Qur'anic Revelation as Re-Citation, predicated on the Biblical that it assumes and resumes, is one elaborate account of a movement from the Semiotics of the evident sur-Face and toward the Hermeneutics of the promised Hidden, away from the Aesthetics of the Seen. 2. The Return of the Repressed Because the Unseen cannot be seen it has a particular pen- chant for being seen. Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whitherso- ever ye turn, there is Allah's Countenance. Lo! Allah is Ail- Embracing, All-Knowing. - The Qur'an 2:115</page><page sequence="12">138 SOCIAL RESEARCH "[A]nd whithersoever ye turn, there is Allah's Countenance" (fa-aynama Tuvallu fa-thamma wajhu Allah) places the Face - Wajh -of the Unseen on everything, East and West, the geographical expansion of being, and this by way of de-Facing everything by sur-Facing the Unseen on everything. The Face of the Unseen de- Faces everything in order to see and show itself on the sur-Face of everything. Now that we cannot see the Unseen, the Unseen pro- claims Itself as visible everywhere, by de-Facing everything. But even this "seeing" of the Face of the Unseen is not an always- already/a¿£ accompli. It cannot be seen ex nihilia ". . . And what- soever good thing ye spend, it is for yourself, when ye spend not save in search of Allah's Countenance " (The Qur'an 2:272) Mission im/possible: And there is the rub where the Face of things actually seen is effectively de-Signed back and away from the Named and unto the presumption of a Sign, a pseudo-Sign. The emerging Sign Language is circular, no longer unidirec- tional, from the Sign unto the Signifier and on to the Transcen- dental Signified. If everywhere we turn and everything we do is to see the Face of the Unseen, then the knowability of the Named Signifieds- door, river, pencil, justice - is reversed back to the un- name-able Sign, the pseudo-Sign, concealing the fact that the Unseen can really not be seen, by arguing that everything we actu- ally do see is Its Face. When the Face of things actually seen is effectively de-Signed, a pseudo-Sign is generated which now in turn lends legitimacy to the implicated Transcendental Signified that the originary mutation of the visible Sign into the Signifier had occasioned. The Re-Citation thus comes at the Sign from two directions: Once by mutating it into a Signifier on the Site of the Sacred Signature and once by sur-Facing the Transcendental Sig- nified that this signature generates on the sur-Face of all Signs, de-Signing them, and thus attributing the status of a Sign (a pseudo-Sign) to the Transcendental Signified. The actual Sign, the Face of the pagan idol observed, is metaphysically cornered. The effect of this double-negation, intended to result in a pos- itive positing of a Face for the Unseen, is an extraordinarily self- conscious anxiety on part of the Re-Cited narrative. The supreme</page><page sequence="13">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 139 anxiety of the Faith in the Unseen, in the absence of Its Face, returns persistently throughout the Qur'an, most vividly in 28:88: And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no God save Him. Everything will perish save His Counte- nance. His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back. - The Qur'an 28:88 "Everything will perish save His Countenance" (kullu shay 'in halikun ilia wajhahu) promises the notation of that which the Unseen exactly lacks, namely a Face, a sight of recognition, a sight of identity, by not only attributing a Face to It but in fact by iden- tifying Its Face as the Only thing that survives. This is an over- compensation of a pseudo-Sign that knows It is not there. It is this anxiety, the anxiety of Its Face not being visible, of not being there, that informs the Qur'anic reversal of "Everything will per- ish save His Countenance" {kullu shay 'in halikun ilia wajhahu). The greatest source of anxiety for the Revelatory language of the Faith, as for all other inaugurating moments of believing in the Unseen and replacing the Site of the Signature for the Sight of the Sign, is precisely this Presence of the Absence at the Center of its gravity. The Metaphysics of Presence is an architectonic replacement for a Visual Absence. Everything in the text is pred- icated on this central moment of an Absence (ghaybah) , and thus the necessity of the Faith in the Absent, in the Unseen, and in effect in the un-See-able. Architecturally, this Presence of the Absence, the de-Facement of the Face, is immediately identifiable by the void, the emptied space, that defines the center of "Islamic" sites, from public squares to mosques. There is never an object that locates and defines the center of a public square or a mosque. The site is always defined by the surrounding walls that embrace an emptiness, tangential references that point to the Presence of an Absence, and yet thus locate and sanctify that</page><page sequence="14">140 SOCIAL RESEARCH absence. The "presence" of a pool at the center of the court, in a mosque or even a square, makes it impossible for anything even to cross the Absence of that Presence, let alone stand there. Believing in the Unseen, the cornerstone of Re-Citing the Qur'anic Truth, is thus replacing the Site of the Sacred Signature for the Sight of the Visible Sign. The Metaphysics of Presence that results is there to conceal (but cannot but nervously reveal) the Visual Absence of any Sign at the center of the most fateful act of Signification in written history. In Re-Citing the Facial Absence, the over-compensation of the Qur'an for the persistent Presence of the Absence at the center of its narrative claims on a Metaphysics of Presence, an attempted retrieval of the Sign of the Face only to repress it even further, finds one of its most creative moments in the chapter on Joseph. The chapter is one of those few occasions in which the Qur'an begins with the staccatos of literal letters with no apparent mean- ing, at once announcing them as Signs and yet proclaiming them as entrants into the realm of the Sacred Signature, Signifiers- about-to-happen: "Alif. Lâm. Râ. These are verses of the Scrip- ture that maketh plain" (The Qur'an 12:1). Here the inarticulate Signifiers-to-be standing for Signs are emphatically proclaimed as "the verses of the Scripture that maketh plain." The strategic move of Sign-as-Signifier becomes even more specific in the next verse: "Lo! We have revealed it, a Lecture in Arabic, that ye may understand" (The Qur'an 12:2). The "Lecture" {Qur'an) is actu- ally the term with which the Text in its entirety is identified here. The semi-Signs "Alif. Lâm. Râ" are here delivered as potential-Sig- nifiers in the specific domain of the Arabic as a Sign-Language, so that Muhammad, as the recipient of the Revelation and thus as human Signatory, and his audience may comprehend the mes- sage. The rhetorical implication is that had it not been for that practical purpose, the Sign and with it the Sacred Signature of the Face, would have been possible, and possibly visible. The stage is thus set for the Sign to mutate into the Signifier. God the Unseen, the Qur'anic Narrator, thus addresses His chosen mes-</page><page sequence="15">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 141 senger and announces that He is about to tell a story by way of an admonition: "We narrate unto thee (Muhammad) the best of narratives in that We have inspired in thee this Qur'an, though aforetime thou wast of the heedless." The "heedless" (ghâfiliyn) are the generic doubters who irresistibly pull the upward mobility of the Signifier towards the Transcendental Signified back to the mutated Sign, always promised, never delivered. The Qur'an is extraordinarily conscious of the presence of the absence of the Sign, and equally aware of its deliberate moves away from the Sign and towards the Signifier, a move that holds its narrative claims together. Because the "heedless" among the Qur'anic addressee always insist on the Sign, retarding the move towards the Signifier, the Unseen calls them blind, and even more emphatically insists that He, the Unseen, has caused their blind- ness: Hast thou seen him who maketh his desire his god, and Allah sendeth him astray purposely, and sealeth up his hear- ing and his heart, and setteth on his sight a covering? Then who will lead him after Allah (hath condemned him)? Will ye not then heed? - The Qur'an 45:23 We have from the Qur'an itself an account of what it is exactly that the "heedless" say and object: And they say; There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and naught destroyeth us save time, when they have no knowledge whatsoever of (all) that; they do but guess. - The Qur'an 45:24 But the story that the Qur'an is about to tell is there to reclaim and de-Face, once and for all, the necessity of that Sign by sub-</page><page sequence="16">142 SOCIAL RESEARCH jecting it to a superior "Sign," the "Sign" in quotation marks, the one that one sees in dream, with eyes wide shut, as it were. The story of Joseph begins with a dream. Joseph informs his father Jacob that he has just had a dream in which he has seen, with his eyes wide shut, eleven planets and the sun and the moon prostrat- ing themselves to him. Jacob warns Joseph against informing his brothers of this dream lest they may harm him. Joseph is thus sin- gled out for the singularity of his vision. Not only his wicked broth- ers but even his father is incapable of "seeing" like Joseph does, with his eyes wide shut. The seeing is delegated to the realm of the dream and thus made more authoritative and then symbolized and made more pregnant with possibilities of interpretation. Jacob's warning is in effect there to underline the significance of the dream, of seeing while the eyes are closed, as a Sign of divine preference. Joseph sees with his eyes closed what others cannot see with their eyes wide open. Joseph's eyes are wide shut. Jacob confirms to Joseph the significance of the dream, of see- ing things with eyes wide shut, as indication of God having cho- sen Joseph to teach him the interpretations of events, and this as a Sign of perfecting His grace upon him. The narration is specif- ically ocularcentric, the Qur'an persisting on the centrality of the Sign which it is now retrieving cautiously in Joseph's dream. The Sign is pregnant to the point that the Qur'an delegates it to its own interpretative retrieval and spells it out right here in the mid- dle of Joseph's telling his father of his dream: "Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs (of Allah's Sovereignty) for the inquir- ing" (The Qur'an 12:7). Joseph as Sign and Seer is the Qur'an 's dream of Itself, the care- fully crafted return of its repressed. Joseph is the return of the Qur'anic repressed precisely in the Sign of its most anxiety-pro- voking absence, namely the absence of the Face of the Unseen, the site of Its recognition, the Signature of Its not-being-there. The Unseen is not seen by our eyes. And the Unseen returns pre- cisely as a mockery of our eyes, their inability to see when they are wide open, and thus the return of the Qur'anic repressed, Joseph, seeing with his eyes wide shut.</page><page sequence="17">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 143 As the return of the Qur'anic repressed, Joseph is not only sig- naled out by his extraordinarily perceptive eyes and by God having selected him, but by his having been endowed with the power to interpret the dreams that he sees. 'Thus thy Lord will prefer thee and will teach thee the interpretation of events, and will perfect His grace upon thee and upon the family of Jacob as He per- fected it upon thy forefather, Abraham and Isaac. Lo! thy Lord is Knower, Wise" (The Qur'an 12:6). Interpretation is to deliver the Sign into the realm of the Signifier, through the site of the Revelatory Signature, and letting it loose to mean. Interpretation (the Qur'anic ta'wîl) is the architectonic edifice of hermeneuti- cally burying the repression of the absence of the Sign in the Qur'anic memory. Joseph is signaled out, retrieved from the Qur'anic memory, as the return of the Qur'anic repressed, by being identified as a dream-interpreter, both seeing the Sign and delivering it into the realm of the Signifier, the mutation and the mutant at the same time. Joseph is made even more emphatically the Sign of the absent Face by the Qur'an being emphatic about his story being the very Sign (âyâtun) for "the inquiring" (li-l- sâïliyn). The perilous anxiety of the narrative exposure of the actively repressed is immediately evident in the danger to which Joseph, as the momentary and strategically conditioned retrieval of the Sign, is exposed. Joseph's jealous brothers at once begin to conspire against him. This is the danger to which the Qur'anic memory exposes itself by retrieving its carefully repressed. One brother suggests to kill him, while the other proposes to throw him into the depth of a pit. Throw him into the depth of a pit they do and then they come weeping to their father "Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another, and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf devoured him, and thou believest not our saying when we speak the truth" (The Qur'an 12:17). Joseph's brothers blame the wolf and produce his blood-stained shirt as evidence. Jacob has no choice but patience. Meanwhile Joseph is discov- ered by a water-drawer from a caravan on its way to Egypt and res-</page><page sequence="18">144 SOCIAL RESEARCH cued from his subterranean dungeon. Joseph is sold very cheaply into slavery in Egypt. His owner, the Prince of Egypt, entrusts him to his wife Zoleikha and asks her to treat him honorably so that perhaps they can adopt him as a son. Reading Joseph as the retrieved Sign and the carefully remembered lost memory of the Qur'anic narrative, pulling it up, as it were, from the subter- ranean dungeon of its repressed anxieties, is now in full view. The Qur'anic narrative is very emphatic here as to the particu- larly evil way in which Joseph is treated. He is cast into a pit by his brothers out of jealousy and malevolence. He is rescued by the Divine Will but he is sold very cheaply into slavery out of the igno- rance of who he really is. But the Qur'an is equally emphatic as to what God has in store for Joseph. God speaks in the First Per- son, Majestic We Narrative: ". . . Thus We established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah was predominant in His career, but most of mankind know not" (The Qur'an 12:21). The repressed returns but under the full control and the protective custody of the Unseen the Nar- rator. It is precisely from the Unseen that Joseph will learn the "interpretation of event" {ta'wîl al-ahâdîth), where he will deliver the realm of the suppressed and absent Sign to that of the promised Signification and begin to interpret things. This trans- mission is under the direct "teaching" of the Unseen the Narra- tor: "And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We reward the good" (The Qur'an 12:22). What is about to happen to Joseph is the narrative plot to retrieve the Qur'anic repression of the Sign, which began with Joseph's eyes (vision) and is now extends into his entire Face (beauty).6 Zoleikha, the wife of Joseph's master, falls madly in love with him and asks "... of him an evil act. She bolted the doors and said: Come!" (The Qur'an 12:23) Joseph refuses. But "... She verily desired him, and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his Lord" (The Qur'an 12:24). The ocularcentricism of the Qur'anic language is unmis- takable here. Joseph "saw the argument of his Lord" (ra'a</page><page sequence="19">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 145 burhâna rabbahu) reveals the fortification of an organic, but exposed, link between the Sign ("saw") and the Signification ("the argument"), so categorically repressed in the Qur'anic nar- rative, and yet here anxiously signaled in the assertion that ". . . Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves" (The Qur'an 12:24). Joseph is chased around the house by the enraptured woman until they are suddenly confronted at the door by her husband. She immediately accuses Joseph of having attacked her and intending to rape her, demanding that he be properly punished. Joseph retorts back that it was she who was attacking him, while one of the wit- nesses proposes to the angry husband that if Joseph's shirt is torn from behind then it was she who was attacking him and if his shirt was torn from the front then it was he who was attacking her. The Egyptian Prince sees that Joseph's shirt is torn from behind and admonishes his wife: ". . . Lo! the guile of you is very great" (The Qur'an 12:2) .7 The harassment of Joseph, as the Sign exposed, here reaches its culmination. Joseph is persecuted not only because of his vision and his ability to interpret - from Sign to Signifier - but because of the beauty of his Face, the Sign manifest, which becomes even more emphatic in the next turn of events. The news of the wife of the Egyptian Prince and her slave-boy is spread all over the city. "And women in the city said: The ruler's wife is asking of her slave-boy an ill-deed. Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in plain aber- ration" (The Qur'an 12:30). What the wife of the Egyptian Prince does in response to these damaging gossips is quite extraordinary. And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them and prepared for them a cushioned couch (to lie on at the feast) and gave to every one of them a knife and said (to Joseph): come out unto them! And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, exclaiming: Allah Blameless! This is not a human being. This is no other than some gracious angel. - The Qur'an 12:31</page><page sequence="20">146 SOCIAL RESEARCH This is a critical moment in the history of the Qur'anic repressed. Joseph, as the returned repressed, is the Face mani- fest. He is the visual exhibition of the Truth that the Qur'anic narrative must ipso facto verbalize (de-visualize and de-face) in order to claim.8 In perhaps the most critical and the most dan- gerous moment of its self-exposure, the Qur'an in effect discloses its self-negational anxiety by putting a Face to its repressed absence of the Sign. If the Qur'an in its entirety is the active and aggressive mutation of the absence of the Sign into the presence of the Signifier (and thus the Signatory Site of its Metaphysics of Presence predicated on a debilitating Absence) so that in its pointing, inevitably, to a Signified it can implicate a Transcen- dental Signified as a simulacrum of the Sign, Joseph, then, is the sublimation of that simulacrum to a foster- "Sign." The narrative is extraordinarily and rather dangerously sensual and erotic. There are accounts of how some medieval radical Islamic hetero- dox factions, such as the Maymûniyya among the Khârijîtes, refused to include the chapter on Joseph in their version of the Qur'an and considered it blasphemous.9 The anxiety of the Maymûniyya, however, reveals something far more serious than the strong sexual connotation of the chapter. In this chapter much more than a woman's sexual prowess is at stake. ". . . And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands" is pre- cisely the point where the anxiety of the Qur'anic Unseen not hav- ing a Face is turned into the danger of if we were to see the Face.10 ". . . exclaiming: Allah Blameless! This is not a human being. This is no other than some gracious angel" is the closest that the Qur'an can possibly come to approximate Joseph's beautiful face to the repressed absence of the Face of the Unseen. Having proved her point, Zoleikha conspires to condemn and incarcerate Joseph into prison. Joseph seeks refuge from the wiles of Zoleikha in prison and prefers to be incarcerated than subjected to such trials. According to the Qur'an, the revelation of Joseph's Face immediately results in the recognition, ". . . after they had seen the signs," ". . . to imprison him for a time" (The</page><page sequence="21">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 147 Qur'an 12:35). The logical inconsistency that we read here, that Joseph is imprisoned though proven innocent, is over-compen- sated by the rhetorical consistency that Joseph is imprisoned after the revelation of the beauty of his Face results in the carnage of women cutting themselves into pieces, enraptured in the beauty of his Face. In prison, Joseph becomes famous for his ability to interpret the dreams of his cell-mates. While interpreting their dreams, Joseph uses the occasion to proselytize for the One True Religion of the Solitary God, admonishing against polytheism. Among Joseph's monotheistic admonitions is one curious insistence that "Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers. Allah hath revealed no sanction of them . . . ." (The Qur'an 12:40). The narrative claim of the Qur'an at this point is of course that by and in Joseph's face, Allah has in effect revealed His hitherto Unseen Face, and thus it is now in a position to name all other deities as merely ". . . names which ye have named, ye and your fathers." The return of the repressed is here taken full advantage of by de-classifying the Faith in Allah as yet another Faith in a Name, but a Faith in a Face, namely the supreme repression of the Qur'anic narrative anchorage. In Joseph's Face, the Faith in Allah is no longer a Faith in just a Name. It is a Faith in a Face. al-Râzî's commentary here is cru- cial: "O my two fellow-prisoners!," O my two friends in jail, "Are divers lords better," are scattered gods better or God the Almighty. He told them so because they had idols in the prison which they worshipped and to which they pros- trated. The reason he called them "diverse" is that they came in all shapes and forms, big, small and medium, made of various things .... "These, as they are, are helpless and impotent, while God Almighty is but One, without any match, rival, similitude, or equal. He is Omnipotent and Almighty, and can do whatever He wants." Then he admon-</page><page sequence="22">148 SOCIAL RESEARCH ished them for their practices and told them of the corrup- tion of their belief, and told them that "if you think hard you are not praying to anything but names that you and your ancestors have given them, which is to say, you call these idols god, while a god is that which deserves obedi- ence. But before a god practices magnanimity he would not deserve worshipping, and if he were not omnipotent he would not be able to grant such magnanimity, nor would he be able to do so, and unless he be alive he could do none of these things. These are all inanimate objects. Calling them gods is not but a meaningless name. The reason is that the Name is not the Named. Because if the Name were the Named, then by virtue of calling them god they would be god and it would be proper to worship them, and they would have been god by attributes, and yet that is impossi- ble .... - al-Râzî 1983, Volume Three, p. 134) Joseph sees and interprets his way out of the prison. Two of his cell-mates have a dream and come to him and ask for his inter- pretations. He interprets them and predicts that one of them will be soon executed while the other released. Then he asks the one who is soon to be released to mention him to the Prince of Egypt. The man is released but Satan makes him forget to mention Joseph to his master so he continues to be incarcerated for some time longer - the "Sign" concealed. Finally the Prince of Egypt has a dream that no one can interpret. The former cell-mate of Joseph finally remembers him and goes to his cell and asks him the interpretation of the dream that the Prince has seen. Joseph informs him of seven years of agricultural prosperity which is to ensue before a seven year cycle of draught and famine. Joseph proceeds to instruct the man about the proper measures that are to be taken against the calamitous seven years. The Prince of Egypt asks for the interpreter of his dream to be summoned to his court. Joseph refuses and insists to clear his name first. He sends</page><page sequence="23">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 149 a message to the Prince and asks him to summon the women who had cut their hands when seeing him in public and ask them the circumstances of their predicament. The Prince does as Joseph demands and is informed by the women in general and by Zoleikha in particular that Joseph is completely innocent and that he has been wronged by their guile. Joseph returns to the Prince of Egypt, completely exonerated and restored in the dignity of his place, and assumes a high position of respect and authority. Joseph asks the Prince of Egypt to put him in charge of storehouses and he thus assumes complete responsibility for managing the famine crisis that faced Egyptians. As the hardship of the famine begins to assert itself, people from around the king- dom and its vicinity flock to Egypt in search of sustenance, among them Joseph's brothers who do not know that the man in charge of the Prince of Egypt's storehouses is none other than their own kid brother they had cast into a well. Joseph denies them any provision until they go back and bring a young brother of his they had left behind. The Qur'an does not name this other brother. But medieval Qur'anic commentaries identify him as Benjamin and as being Joseph's brother from the same mother (al-Râzî, 1983, Volume Three, p. 147). Joseph's brothers return to Kanaan and convince Jacob to let them take Benjamin to Egypt. Jacob reluctantly con- cedes. The eleven brothers of Joseph go back to Egypt in the hope of getting more provisions. Joseph pulls a trick on his brothers, reveals his identity to his full brother, surreptitiously hides a measur- ing cup in his bag, then publically announces it stolen, and uses the stratagem as a ploy to keep his brother in Egypt. The other brothers are forced to go back to Kanaan and give the sad news to their father. Their father, distressed, puts his trust in God and sends them back to Egypt, where Joseph reveals his identity to them and gives them his shirt to take to his father and put on his eyes so that his sight is returned. They do as told. Jacob, his wife and children come to Egypt and prostrate to Joseph, at which point Joseph tells his father that this was the interpretation of his childhood dream, when eleven stars and the sun and the moon were prostrating to him.</page><page sequence="24">150 SOCIAL RESEARCH The originary position of Joseph as Sign giving birth to a sus- tained generation of Signifiers is perhaps nowhere presented as succinctly and pointedly as in his conversation with his brother Benjamin, as reported by al-Râzî. Benjamin grows up in the total absence of Joseph and as a surrogate to Joseph with his father Jacob. Joseph manages to keep him behind in Egypt when he dis- patches his brothers to bring his parents. While in Egypt, the fol- lowing conversation takes place between Joseph and Benjamin: Joseph: What is your name? Benjamin: IbnYamin. Joseph: What does Ibn Yamin mean?" Benjamin: The Afflicted Son. Joseph: Why did they call you that? Benjamin: Because when I was born my mother died [lit- erally, pish e khoday shod: "went to God."] Joseph: Who was your mother? Benjamin: Rahil bent Layan bent Nakhur. Joseph: Do you have any children? Benjamin: I have ten sons. Joseph: What are their Names? Benjamin: One is Bal'a, one Akhira, one Ashkal, one Akhiya, one Akhbar, one Nu'man, one Awrad, one Aris, one Hay'im, and one Maythim. Joseph: What kind of names are these? Benjamin: I have drawn the etymology [eshteqaq] of these names from the conditions [ahwal' of my brother Joseph. Bal'a because he disappeared, "the earth swallowed him." As if the earth swallowed him. Akhira because he was the first- born child to my mother. Ashkal because he looked like me and was from the same set of parents as I am and was as old as I am. Akhiya because he was the best of us wherever he was. Nu'man because he was graceful and most dear to our par- ents. Awrad because he was like a red rose among us. Aris because he was like a leader and a master to us. Hay'im because our hope and aspiration is that he is alive. Maythim</page><page sequence="25">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 151 because if we were to see him again our happiness will be complete (al-Râzî, 1883, Volume Three, p. 147). n This is a crucial conversation between Joseph and his alter-ego and it matches, echoes and complements perfectly the destruc- tion of the idols in the prison scene. In effect, while Joseph is in prison and smashing (de-Facing) the idols (Signs), his alter-ego (notice that Benjamin says that Joseph and I are identical in look, age and parenthood) is giving birth to his Name-sakes. But the Name-sakes are deriving their Names from Joseph's predicament. Thus in the very act of Joseph's life there is a gradual manifestation of his Names as Signifiers as he relentlessly destroys (de-Faces) the evident idols, Signs. We also need to notice the simultaneous fate of Joseph's father Jacob, as his alter-ego Benjamin is in effect manifesting him in absentia. The Qur'anic Re-Presentation of Joseph as the "Sign," the return of its repressed under the protective custody of the Unseen so as to Reveal Itself ever so cautiously, is commensurate with Jacob, as the prophetic voice of his people, losing his sight. Jacob loses his sight in the absence of Joseph's Face: ". . . and his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing" (The Qur'an 12:84). Jacob is to be blinded while Joseph reveals himself because his blindness is the prelude to a new kind of in/sight, to be blinded in order to see better, to be able to see the Sign of the Unseen though ordinarily the Unseen cannot be seen. The blind- ness of Jacob is thus the suspension of seeing with the physical eyes, so that he can begin to see with his eyes wide shut. It is in the certainty of that inner perception with eyes wide shut that Jacob can assure his other, blind, sons that ". . . despair not of the Spirit of Allah" (The Qur'an 12:87). Jacob can now see with his eyes wide shut things that other people cannot see with their eyes wide open. The Sign of the Unseen, in Jacob and Joseph's dream, is categorically to resist mutation into a Signifier. Because being mutated into a Signifier is to be seen. And the Qur'anic Unseen cannot be seen.12</page><page sequence="26">152 SOCIAL RESEARCH Once Joseph has properly revealed himself, as the Sign of the Unseen, he restores his father's physical eyes, enabling him, on behalf of everyone in sight, to see the Sign: "Go with this shirt of mine," Joseph says to his brothers, "and lay it on my father's face, he will become a seer; and come to me with all your folk" (The Qur'an 12:93). 13 Prior to Jacob's gaining his in/sight, the Qur'an is emphatic that he cannot see, but he can smell Joseph: "When the caravan departed their father had said: Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard. (Those around him) said: By Allah, lo! thou art in thine old aberration" (The Qur'an 12:94-95). Jacob is of course right and his folks wrong: "Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid it on his face and he became a seer once more. He said: Said I not unto you that I know from Allah that which ye know not?" (The Qur'an 12:96) The extension of Joseph's body, his shirt restores his father's eyes before he can see him. The crucial point here is that actually no one "sees" Joseph before his father comes to Egypt, prostrates to him, and he tells him the true meaning of his child- hood dream. It is true that his ten brothers see him repeatedly before their father does. But they do not know that this is Joseph. So in effect they have not seen him. The only brother, a full- brother, who actually sees Joseph and Joseph reveals his identity to him, Benjamin, is really a redundant figure and none other than Joseph's own alter ego, Joseph himself, had the Unseen not decided to turn him into Its own Sign. Lest the point be lost as to what it is exactly that the Unseen has just revealed, the Qur'an makes it perfectly clear: "This is of the tid- ings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee (Muhammad) . . . ." (The Qur'an 12:102). Having just sighted the Sign, the Unseen is now ready to move for the final cut: "How many a portent is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by with face averted. And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners (unto Him)" (The Qur'an 12:105-1 06). 15 Here we see the crucial crisis of identity that the vision of the Unseen ought to address. Having constituted Joseph's face as the Sign, and the</page><page sequence="27">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 153 Face, of the Unseen, the Unseen can now categorically state that the heavens and earth is full of such Signs and that people simply cannot see them. Having just restored Jacob's vision, the hope is that he and everyone else will now be able to see the Sign in Joseph's Face. But the complaint that "And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners (unto Him)" gives away the anxiety of the Unseen not to be seen in par with visible idols of the sort that Joseph smashed and ridiculed while in prison. Thus the final testament of Faith becomes: "Say: This is my Way: I call on Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever followeth me - Glory be to Allah! - and I am not of the idolaters" (The Qur'an 12:108). Idolatry is the insistence on the visible Sign, while Joseph's Face is the return of the Qur'anic repressed triumphant: Abrogating the visible Sign for the Face of the Unseen. 3. Sights of the Sign in Practice: Paganism If Joseph is the return of the Qur'anic repressed triumphant, signs of resistance to that triumph are abundant through the Qur'an itself. As the Qur'an suppresses the Sign, transmutes it into the Signifier of the Name, and finally re-appropriates it as the simulacrum of the pseudo-Sign of Joseph's Face, the visible Signs, the Signs of the evident, drawn, and sculpted, are putting stiff resistances.16 Like his great ancestor Abraham, Joseph is an idol- smasher: destroyer of Signs, the Facial agency of the Signifier. There is a scene in which Zoleikha is seducing Joseph when the Qur'anic commentators tells us that: Zoleikha gets up and puts a veil on the head of the idol [that was in her private chambers] . Joseph asked: "What is this you just did?" She said: "I am ashamed of the idol. It was looking at us." Joseph said: 'You are ashamed of an idol who cannot hear or see and yet I am not to be ashamed</page><page sequence="28">154 SOCIAL RESEARCH from He who created everything and knows everything, hears and sees and can benefit and damage everything?" (al-Maybudî, 1960, p. 58) This is an extraordinary instance when the face of the idol is to be covered exactly at the moment when Joseph's Face is to be revealed in Zoleikha's description of his facial beauty (al- Maybudî, 1960, p. 58). 17 We have a repetition of this situation in the prison where Joseph admonishes his cell-mates for prac- ticing idolatry and smashes their idols (al-Râzî, 1883, Volume Three, p. 134). At the end, Zoleikha destroys the idols she wor- shipped, becomes a true Muslim, and after the death of her hus- band marries Joseph, in effect worshipping the God that Joseph's Face Re-Presents instead. All of these point to the prin- cipal nemesis of Joseph's Sign, the Sign of the idols, the visible, the evident, Signs. Signs of resistance to their transmutations into Signifiers, so that a whole culture of literary signification is made possible, are evident throughout the Qur'an itself. The Qur'anic admonition: "And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners (unto Him)" (The Qur'an 12:106) already points to the pagan practice of worshipping the deity allah though not as a Supreme Qur'anic Unseen but as what historians of pre-Islamic Arabia call a "high god" among many others.18 The Qur'anic transmutation of the evident Sign into the Signifier Unseen is immediately rooted in the transition of Arabia from a practicing pagan community into a monothe- istic ummah. The Qur'anic narrative is categorically directed against the insurrection of the pagan Signs resisting their upward mobility towards Signifying something metaphysical and beyond themselves. The term shirk (constituting companions for God) and mushrik (those who do so) is the most loathsome term in the Qur'anic self-assertion. Constituting companions for allah begins by acknowledging his superiority but then leveling him with other pagan deities, or more accurately pulling His transmutation into</page><page sequence="29">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 155 a Transcendental Signified down and back to the originary pagan Sign visible in the Face of its evidence. Here is a critical passage: And if thou wert to ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, and constrained the sun and the moon (to their appointed work)? they would say: Allah .... And if thou wert to ask them: Who cause th water to come down from the sky, and therewith reviveth the earth after its death? they verily would say: Allah .... And when they mount upon the ships they pray to Allah, making their faith pure for Him only, but when He bringeth them safe to land, behold! they ascribe partners (unto Him). - The Qur'an 29: 61-65 The battle here is far more critical than between an emerging monotheism and a resistant polytheism. The real battle is between the pagan persistence of that polytheism in the primacy of the Sign and the aggressive transmutation of the Sign, in the absence of an evident Divine Face, into a Signifier so that it can implicate One Unseen as the Transcendental Signified. Here is the evidence of that real battle: And verily: if thou shoudst ask them: Who created the heav- ens and the earth? they will say: Allah. Say: Bethink you then of those ye worship beside Allah, if Allah willed some hurt for me, could they remove from me His hurt; or if He willed some mercy for me, could they restrain His mercy? Say: Allah is my all. In Him do (all) the trusting put their trust. - The Qur'an 39:38 Allah, in effect, is the One Unseen necessitated to warrant the muta- tion of all evident Signs into mutated Signifiers, so that the very pos- sibility of signification is made possible. That is why Allah is the Most</page><page sequence="30">156 SOCIAL RESEARCH Significant, the Transcendental Signified. The power-basing between Allah and the other deities is predicated on the sublima- tion of His power in an upward metaphysical mobility, an abstrac- tion of the pagan evidence of His Facial Sign into His Signifier Name, and ultimately His Constitution as a transcendental Signifier to which all Signs and Signifiers point. The reason that in the Joseph's story we read Joseph admonishing his pagan cell-mates for worshipping idols and dismissing their idols, saying Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers. Allah hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with Allah only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the right religion, but most men know not - The Qur'an 12:40 is precisely this insistence that the new practice of Naming ought to be the exclusive prerogative of "the right religion," and not shared by other deities. In the absence of God's Face, by desig- nating Him as the Unseen, the would-be Sign of its metaphysical Existence is mutated from its actual pagan Sign into the Signifier of His Name, so that by pointing to its inevitable Named it can constitute the sublimated deity into the Supreme Transcendental Signified. Once the active and aggressive mutation of the Sign into the Signifier is accomplished, the Metaphysics of the Pres- ence in the exclusionary domain of the Divine Transcendental Signified is categorically and constitutionally accomplished: Say: Unto Whom (belongeth) the earth and whosoever is therein, if you have knowledge? They will say: Allah. Say: Will ye not then remember? Say: Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the tremendous Throne? They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: Will ye not then keep duty (unto Him)? Say: In Whose hand is the domin- ion over all things and He protected!, while against Him</page><page sequence="31">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 157 there is no protection, if ye have knowledge? They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: How then are ye bewitched? Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars. - The Qur'an 23:84-90 "Bewitched" (tusharuna) and "liars" (kadhibuna) are now the designators of the just-about-to-be defeated pagan persistence of the Sign, while "the Truth" (al-Haqq) is the, now, always-already achieved Transcendental Signified. The death-blow to practiced paganism, the sight of the Sign metaphysically transmuted into a "vision" of the Unseen, occurs in Chapter Fifty-Three of the Qur'an, a narrative event that cycli- cally complements Chapter Twelve and the appearance of the fig- ure of Joseph. Here the central figure is Prophet Muhammad himself. Chapter Fifty-Three, the Sûrah An-Najm ("The Star"), as an early Meccan Sûrah, that is to say at a time when the Meccan paganism is receiving its severest shock, is emphatic, cataclysmic, and explosive in it opening utterance: "By the Star when it set- teth" (The Qur'an 53:1). The Sixth/Twelfth century Qur'anic commentator al-Tabarsî, summarizing his predecessors suggests that here God swears by the Qur'an "which was revealed like stars upon the prophet, God's Peace and Benedictions be upon him, in [a span of] twenty-three years" (al-Tabarsî, [1406] 1986, Vols. 9- 10, p. 260). The Meccans, though, did not take this announce- ment so lightly, we know from other commentators, or read it so figuratively. When the son of Abu Lahab, to whom the Prophet's daughter was married, heard this verse he was so outraged, because he thought the Prophet had offended the Deity of Star, that he divorced the Prophet's daughter (al-Maybudî, 1960, Vol- ume Nine, p. 353). 19 But the reading of the subsequent com- mentators is quite crucial because it clearly establishes the narrative text of the Qur'an and the act of Revelation against the Signal authority of the Meccan idols. The cataclysmic, though inviting and re-assuring, announcement then proceeds to assure</page><page sequence="32">158 SOCIAL RESEARCH Muhammad's listeners that 'Your comrade erreth not, nor is deceived; Nor doth he speak of his own desire" (The Qur'an 53:2- 3) . It is precisely in the language and logic of that Revelation that the Qur'an assures its readers that Muhammad is now "speaking" on behalf of One Higher, Transcendental, Authority, furthered and removed from the Signal site of the pagan practices: "It is naught save an inspiration that is inspired" (The Qur'an 53:4). The language of "inspiration" (wahy) and "the inspired" (yuha), which can equally be read as "revelation" and "the revealed," is the Qur'anic narrative site that constitutionally mutates the signal sight of the practiced paganism. With the "Which one of mighty powers hath taught him, One vigorous; . . .," (The Qur'an 53:5- 6) even if we accept the account of the commentators that it refers to Archangel Gabriel (al-Maybudî, 1969, Volume Nine, p. 355; al-Tabarsî, 1986, Vols. 9-10, p. 261), though the term 'allamahu ("hath taught him") could very well refer to God,20 the reference to the Unseen as the Supreme Transcendental Signi- fied is now complete. The next move is the active constitution of the very act of Reve- lation as the mode of the Unseen manifesting itself not in Sign but in Words, Signifiers that must point to their Signifieds and thus ipso facto implicate One Absolute and Final Transcendental Sig- nified. Archangel Gabriel is the agency of that revelatory act: "One vigorous; and he grew clear to view/When he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down/Till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer, and He revealed unto His slave that which He revealed" (The Qur'an 53:6-10). al- Tabarsî insists that Gabriel "appeared to Muhammad, God's Peace and Benedictions be upon Him, in the face that was cre- ated for him," and that he "appeared with the face of human beings" (al-Tabarsî, 1986, Vols. 9-10, p. 262). The "conversation" between Muhammad and Gabriel is closely intimate. They come to "two bows' length or even nearer" of each other and thus the act of Revelation is through the intermediary of the Archangel and via the very "breath" (The Qur'an 32:9) of the Unseen.</page><page sequence="33">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 159 Upon this moment of Revelation, the language of the Qur'an the Re-Cited becomes thoroughly ocularcentric, emphasizing the Prophet's seeing the Archangel: "The heart lied not (in seeing) what it saw. Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he seeth?" (The Qur'an 53:11-12) The disputation is of course by the pagan Meccans who simply refuse to succumb the sight of their visual evidence of the Sign to its mutation into the site of the Sig- nifier, in this case Archangel Gabriel Revealing the Word of God. Just One Word from God the Unseen and the entire autonomy of the Sign is forfeited for good. It is precisely for this reason that the Qur'an accuses the pre-Islamic Meccans of "Ignorance" (jâhilîyyah) (The Qur'an 3:154; 5:50; 33:33; 48:26), namely igno- rance of the Qur'anic God, its Transcendental Signified, adamant as the pagans were in upholding the sight of the Sign they visually saw in the Face (and the body) of their idols. The final move is the arrangement of a visitation, here and now, there and then, between Muhammad and the Unseen. On behalf of all the skeptics, the humanity at large, the visual beholders of the Sign, Muhammad is now actually to see the Unseen and get the whole predicament over with: "And verily he saw him yet another time/By the lote-tree of the utmost boundary, Nigh unto which is the Garden of Abode. When that which shroudeth did enshroud the lote-tree, The eye turned not aside nor yet was over- bold. Verily he saw one of the greatest revelations of his Lord" (The Qur'an 53:13-18). These verses are the origin of one of the greatest visual dramas in Islamic counter/visual culture, the instance of seeing the Unseen. Many medieval Muslim commen- tators have of course taken this visitation metaphorically and read the passage "The heart lied not (in seeing) what it saw" to mean that Muhammad saw God in "his heart." But many commentators have equally insisted on a very literal reading of the passage, insisting that "God Almighty raised Muhammad's body to the heavens, while alive and perfectly healthy, until he saw what he saw in the Heavenly Abode with his [physical] eyes. And this was not in his dream .... [There is a] difference between seeing</page><page sequence="34">160 SOCIAL RESEARCH while awake and seeing in a dream. Seeing while awake is really to comprehend [idrâkahu] with the [physical] eyes, while seeing in dream is to imagine [tasawwur] in the heart, as in the pre- sumption [tawahhum] of comprehension, with the sensation [hâs- sah] of seeing" (al-Tabarsî, 1986, Vols. 9-10, 264), The Meccan paganists put up a staunch resistance to believing the very possibility of this visitation, on which depended their entirely ocularcentric practice of paganism and the primacy of the Sign. It is reported that when in the morning of his return [from his nocturnal trip to the Heavens] the Prophet, God's Peace and Benedictions be upon Him, reported of the first earthly part of his trip to Jerusalem, his companions were elated and the news soon spread throughout Mecca. Abu Bakr the Righteous [a close companion of the Prophet] was absent that day and had not seen the Holy Prophet. When Abu Jahl [one of the staunchest and most powerful enemies of the Prophet] heard of this news, he told himself, "If there were to be only one reason to dissuade Abu Bakr from remaining a follower of Muhammad then that reason will have to be this impossible news." So he got up and went to see Abu Bakr. He told him: "O Son of Abu Qahâfah, this friend of yours Muhammad tells of such an impossibility that no reasonable man could possibly believe. He says: 'Yesterday I have left this mosque [in Mecca] and gone to Jerusalem and then returned that very evening.' O Abu Bakr, can you believe that a man would be able in one night to leave Mecca for Jerusalem and then come back that very evening? That is about a month worth of travel for a cara- van and a man on his feet. If you believe this impossible news, then no doubt there is something wrong with your wits.' Abu Bakr the Righteous conveyed to him an answer in utmost precision and perspicacity. He said: "Ifhesaidit, then it is true." Abu Jahl was totally disappointed in him. Abu Bakr rushed to the Prophet and before sitting down he</page><page sequence="35">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 161 asked him in utter sincerity and in utmost devotion: "O Prophet of God, tell me of your journey yesterday." The Prophet said: "O Abu Bakr, yesterday Gabriel came and brought me the Burâq [the steed on which the Prophet ascended to the Heavens] and took me to Jerusalem where I saw the souls of the pure prophets and the lords of the Higher Heavens. I led them all towards the Heavenly realm until we reached the High Heavens where I saw the Signs of the Almighty [Ay at e Rubra7]. And then that very night I returned to Mecca." Abu Bakr said: 'You are telling the truth, O Messenger of God. I swear by that God Who sent you in truth that as you have been taken while awake, in your form and person, in this journey from a [physical] place to another, my soul has similarly journeyed towards your companionship. Your journey was in form and matter, while mine in your service in soul and secret. Mine in your service is in dream, while yours in awakenness, with the approval of [God] the Truth." As this conversation was pro- ceeding, the Trustful Gabriel descended and brought this verse: "And whoso bringeth the truth and believeth therein [-Such are the dutiful]" [The Qur'an: 39: 33]. From this day forward the title of Abu Bakr once again became "The Trustful" and until the hour of Judgement the people of the True Path and Consensus [i.e. the Majority of Muslims, with the exception of the Shi'ites] believe in his leadership [because he succeeded the prophet as the first caliph], because of his believing in the Nocturnal Journey [of the Prophet's tni'mfl. - al-Maybudî, 1960, Vol. 9, pp. 376-378 Al-Maybudî, who reports this incidence in his Qur'anic com- mentary, gives us a brilliant ocularcentric explanation as to why was it that God decided to bring Muhammad to His Heavenly Abode:</page><page sequence="36">162 SOCIAL RESEARCH One more explanation [as to why Prophet Muhammad was taken to the Heavenly abode] is that the Mission which He had bestowed [upon the Prophet] would be bestowed by virtue of Vision [Mushâhidah] and Sight [Nadhar] and not by virtue of Hearing [Sama*] and Utterance [Khabar]. Because Utterance [Khabar] is not like Visual Observation [al-Mu'âyinah]. So that when the Prophet described the blessings of the Paradise and the torments of the Hell he would be able to say, "I Saw it," and not just "I heard it." Because that is logically more persuasive, it convinces more effectively and powerfully. - al-Maybudî, 1960, Vol. 5, p. 482; emphasis in original by way of writing it in Arabic rather than in Persian Muslim commentators are of course very adamant that this noc- turnal journey and visitation with the Unseen did not take place in the Prophet's dream but in perfect awakenness and that it was in his physical body that he was taken to this journey (al-Maybudî, 1960, Vol. 5, p. 483). What we actually read in 53:18 is a clear visualization of the visual encounter, "Verily he saw one of the greater revelations of his Lord." The Qur'an in fact gives a very accurate positioning of the Prophet's eyes in 53:17: "The eye turned not aside nor yet was overbold." What is happening at this moment is the effective visu- alization of the Invisible, the Unseen seen. The effect is cataclysmic. The Sign is in effect re-claimed, re-appropriated, and yet kept at the unattainable distance of the Transcendental Signified. As Tran- scendental Signified, the Unseen is of course first and foremost phonocentrically signified through the Qur'anic Voice. But, and there is the Qur'anic ocularcentric claim that puts an end to all other claims, once thus constituted, the Qur'anic Transcendental Signified is paralyzingly conscious of the pagan persistence of the Sign making a mockery of its mutation into the Signifier that makes the whole Faith possible. By the Prophet's visitation of the Invisible, the Transcendental Signified now signals Itself as the Sign, incapac- itating all other Signs except Itself.</page><page sequence="37">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 163 In Sûrah al-Najm proper, immediately after the description of the Prophet's nocturnal visitation to the Heavenly Abode, we have the famous references to the three Meccan deities of Al-Lât, Al- 'Uzza' and Manât: "Have ye thought upon AL-Lât and Al- 'Uzzâ/And Manât, the third, the other? Are yours the males and His the females? That indeed were an unfair divisions!" (The Qur'an 53:19-22) The principal function of these verses here, coming immediately after the most emphatic attempt at removing the Achilles Heel of the invisibility of the Unseen is once and for all castigating the downward pull of Arab paganism towards the Sign. The Qur'anic reference to pagan deities has been the subject of considerable attention. A number of Orientalist scholars have noted the repetition of references in the Qur'an to "the daugh- ters of God." (See, for example, Watt, 1988, pp. 30, 87.) From these references the particular shape of the pagan pantheon has been estimated. The emphasis of 53:19-22, "have ye thought upon Al-Lât and Al-'Uzzâ/And Manât, the third, the other? Are yours the males and His the females? That indeed were an unfair division!," is taken as evidence of God being particular not to have any "daughters." But the Qur'anic dissimulation of God from pagan practices is not limited to withdrawing any possibility of His having daughters. He is equally characterized by not having sons, as in the case against Christ being considered his son: O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning Allah save the truth. The Mes- siah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and say not "Three" - Cease! (it is) better for you! - Allah is only One God. Far is it removed from His Transcendent Majesty that He should have a son. He is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender. - The Qur'an 4:171</page><page sequence="38">164 SOCIAL RESEARCH In fact God the Unseen is categorically exempted from being born or giving birth: "Say: He is Allah, the One! Allah, the eter- nally Besought of all! He begetteth not nor was begotten. And there is none comparable unto him" (The Qur'an 4:171). There are also controversies about the occasion and variations of these four verses, referring to pagan deities as they do and exempting God the Unseen to have any similarity with them. On the authority of some early Muslim commentators, including al- Tabari, some Orientalist scholars have argued that the first two verses of this section were initially followed by two other verses acknowledging the power of these pagan deities to intercede on behalf of their believers (see Bell and Watt, 1970, p. 55; and Watt, 1988, p. 86). Muslim scholars, on the other hand (and with few exceptions) categorically deny such a possibility (see Na'ini (Introduction) in Kalbî's, [1364] 1985, pp. 21-24). The order of the verses as they are purported are as follows: Have you considered al-Lât and al-' Uzza and Manât, the third, the other? These are the intermediaries exalted, whose intercession is to be hoped for. Such as they do not forget.21 The contention is that the Prophet first acceded to the pressure of Meccan paganists and thought of acknowledging their deities and thus considered three major idols - al-Lât, al-'Uzzâ, and Manât - as the "daughters" of God, incorporating them, as it were, into the emerging cosmogony. W. Montgomery Watt, as an advo- cate of this view among the Orientalist scholars, suggests that: The first thing to be said about the story is that it cannot be a sheer invention. Muhammad must at some point have recited as part of the Qur'an the verses which were later rejected as satanic in origin. No Muslim could possibly have invented such a story about Muhammad, and no reputable</page><page sequence="39">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 165 Muslim scholar would have accepted it from a non-Muslim unless fully convinced of its truth. The Muslims of today tend to reject the story since it contradicts their idealized picture of Muhammad; but, on the other hand it could be taken as evidence that Muhammad was 'a human being like themselves' [The Qur'an:] (41.6; etc.) (Watt, 1988, p. 86). Muslim scholars, recognizing fully the difference between the humanity of their Prophet and the sanctity of the Infallible Text which is believed to be the very Voice of God and as such at the root of their ancestral faith think otherwise. They maintain that: A number of European scholars and Orientalists who do not believe in revelation and the mission of the Prophet of Islam have maintained, without any research and in utter ignorance, that the rallying cry of the Quraysh [a Meccan Tribe into which the Prophet was born] idolaters which was uttered by them before the appearance of Islam and in the course of their pilgrimage rituals . . . was a verse of the Qur'an. They have based themselves on an inaccurate and vague report by [the Early Muslim historian] Muhammad ibn 'Umar al-Wâqidî (130/747-207/822), without paying any attention to the account of Hishâm [ibn Muhammad al- Kalbî, the author of Kitâb al-Asnâm, one of the earliest sources on pre-Islamic Arab paganism]. Wâqidî's account is not considered to be accurate by any other Muslim scholar before or after al-Wâqidî except Muhammad ibn Jarîr al-Tabarî who was avaricious in collecting every account, whatever it might be, and who took this account from al-Wâqidî and included it in his [Qur'anic] commen- tary without accepting or rejecting it (Na'ini's Introduction toal-Kalbî, 1985, p. 22). The controversy among Orientalist and Muslim scholars is of course entirely irrelevant and misses the triumphant victory of Qur'anic Revelation over the very idea of paganism. What is impor-</page><page sequence="40">166 SOCIAL RESEARCH tant is that in Sûrah al-Najm, the persistent pagan insistence on the primacy of the Sign, of the Visible sight of their idols, is putting its last resistance to its aggressive and final transmutation into Signifier so that the entire Qur'anic narrative triumphs on its substitution of the Voice for the Vision, the Ear for the Eye, the Sound for the Sight: Blinding of the Eye, opening of the Ear. 4. Triumph of Logocentricism As the inaugural moment of a culture, the Qur'an is the narra- tive manifesto of a globalizing abstraction when the particulars of a tribally diverse configuration of the real are aggressively trans- muted to become the Transcendental Universais of a Cosmic Order. In the process of this globalizing abstraction of particu- lars, from tribal to Cosmic, from Patrimonial Gemeinschaft to Patriarchal Gesselschaft, the local iconic deities with identifiable Faces and as recognizable Signs yield collectively to a Supreme Abrahamic Monotheism over which presides an Absolute Deity, the Allah with no Face to see, Divinity the Unseen, and as the Decisive suppresser of the Sign. The active Qur'anic transmuta- tion of the pagan Sign into narrative Signifier, on the site of the Sacred Signature of Revelation, is no historical accident. It corre- sponds to the social transformation of Arabia from a scattered body of nomadic tribes into a cohesive community of commercial capitalism. The Anonymity of the Super-Tribe, Islamic Ummah, as the site of the emerging faith, is represented by the Metaphys- ical Abstraction of all scattered Signs into Sacred Signifiers so that in their pointing to their designated Signifieds they would collec- tively implicate a Transcendental Signified, code-Named the Unseen. The Muslim faith-full thus become those who in the absence of the Face, "yu'minun bi-al-ghayb" "believe in the Unseen." The commercial consolidation of Arabia, foregrounded by the tribal incorporation of the peninsula, paved the way for a new</page><page sequence="41">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 167 social organization ideologically predicated on a more global, and globalizing, cosmogony. As Arabia becomes integral to a globaliz- ing logic of the capital in the region, tribal deities begin to yield to a corresponding Universe of Abstractions, the multiplicity of their identifiable Signs succumbing to the monotheism of a Singular body of Signification.22 The normative systematization of diverse pagan practices was a precondition to pave the way for an eco- nomic federation that would facilitate the caravan commerce between Syria and Yemen. The result was a Revelatory consolidation of a metaphysical taxonomy, complete with its theology (ordered under the supreme authority of Allah), prophetology (concluded with the charismatic authority of Muhammad), cosmology (cen- tered around earth as the testing ground of a covenant contracted in the Garden of Eden), and angelology (mitigated through the intermediary function of Archangel Gabriel) . The result is the aggressive transmutation of an iconic Semiotics into a textual Hermeneutics, whereby the centrality of the Sign is categorically condemned in a colossal celebration of a Sacred Act of Significa- tion. The visual Sign thus yields to the verbal Signifier, as individ- ual iconic idols yield to the supreme metaphysical authority of One God, who is now the Unseen. The repression of the Sign is successful but not final. While the Chapter on Joseph is the most critical moment of the Qur'anic self-exposure of its anxiety of having de-Faced an iconic culture by subjecting it to a Transcendental Logocentricism, the Sûrah al- Najm, particularly the story of the Prophet's nocturnal journey to the Heavenly Abode, balanced by the aggressive denunciation of three prominent pagan idols, point to a critical moment when the iconic culture carries its resistance to Metaphysical Transcenden- talization into the pages of the Qur'an. It is not of course acci- dental that the story of the Prophet's journey visibly to see the Unseen precedes the moment when we have one of the strongest categorical condemnation of paganism in the Qur'an. Nor is it accidental that this moment of categorical and final break with practiced paganism has at least had the appearance of a moment</page><page sequence="42">168 SOCIAL RESEARCH of concession to paganism. Any concession to paganism, how- ever, is so categorically against the very logic of the Qur'anic Re- Citation of the Truth as the supreme Signifier/Transcendental Signified that it is hard to take it seriously if we are not to contra- dict the very driving energy of Revelation that informs and sustains the Sacred Narrative. The Qur'an could not have conceded to paganism of any slightest sort without categorically contradicting its constitutional, Text-long, condemnation of idolatry as the nec- essary precondition for its aggressive mutation of the pagan Sign into monotheistic Signifier. What far more importantly the Qur'anic reference to the three pagan deities points to is the identification of a particularly weak moment when the metaphys- ical Transcendentalization of visual icons into verbal logos is severely resisted by pagan practices. The resistance, however, is doomed. By chapter Fifty-Three in the Text, Sûrah al-Najm, in whatever order we may read the One-Hundred-Twenty-Four Chapters of the Qur'an, chronological or otherwise, the iconic culture is aggressively metalogosed (metamorphosed from Sign to Signifier, from sight to sound, from the visual focus to audile logos, from Face to Name) thoroughly, almost simultaneously with the successive defeats that the Prophet inflicted upon the Meccan establishment at the Battle of Badr in 624, the Battle of Uhud in 625, the Battle of Ditch at 627, the Pact of al-Hudaybiyah in 628, and finally his triumphant entry into Mecca to smash all the idols at Ka'bah on 1 1 January 630. The material expansion of historical forces needed, and welcomed the appearance of, a new Universalizing Metaphysics, a potent Metaphysical Economy of Signification, the Transcendental globalization of the tribal. The Qur'an is the manifesto of a Universal Globalization of the Sacred against the native autonomy of tribal paganism. The Qur'anic rhetoric against paganism, dismissing the whole cultural practice of it as a period of "Ignorance" (Jâhiliyyah) , is fore- grounded by and in its cataclysmic constitution and Globalization of the Sacred that it presumes and resumes from the Biblical nar- rative at large. Precisely like Christianity centuries earlier, Islam</page><page sequence="43">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 169 is the Global Universalization of the Judaic particular. Judaic Uni- versalism, implanted in its tribal particularism, remained always de jure and never defacto. Christianity brought that de jure to defacto in the North, Islam in the South. The difference between Judaism and all other particular tribal patriarchies is the active transmutation of the Sign in the Hebrew Bible into the Signifier of YHWH, unpronounceable, a Sign pretending to be a Signifier, a Signifier strategically concealing its aggressive mutation of the non/Sign it Re-Presents. In the Hebrew Bible, and in its re-Narra- tion in the Arabic Qur'an, we witness the birth of a literary faith in the violent metalogosization of the creative imagination, from the Sign to the Signifier, from the Face to the Name. In its South- ern and Northern forms, the varieties of European and Afro- Asian paganism remained singularly Semiotic, logistically particular. Christianity and Islam borrowed the Biblical mutation of the Sign into Signifier and run it to its Universal and Globaliz- ing conclusions: The collapse of the Sign into the Signifier, of the particular into the Universal, of the material into the abstract, of the Semiotic into the Hermeneutic, and ultimately of the Aes- thetics of the particular into the Metaphysics of the Presence, to cover its categorical contingency on a Primal Absence. The active hostility between Islam and Christianity throughout the medieval and modern history is precisely because they are two competing universalizations of a common particular. Evident in the Qur'an are both its self-conscious awareness of an active repression of the Sign, so that in the absence of the Face of the Unseen His Voice can author the Faith, an anxiety which is best evident in the Chapter on Joseph, and the vestiges of the last ditch resistances by the tribal cosmogonies of idolic Signs to their active mutation into a Universal Metaphysics of Signifiers, pointing sub- missively to One, Final, Absolute, Transcendental Signified. In 45:24, "And they say: There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and naught destroyeth us save time; when they have no knowledge whatsoever of (all) that; they do but guess," we have a textual witness to the minimalism of the tribal cosmogonies of the</page><page sequence="44">170 SOCIAL RESEARCH evident, life at its Face-value. Resistance to the very idea of an "after- life" is the categorical resistance to the Sign of the evident being col- lapsed and transmuted into the Signature of the promised. Time (dahr) is the narrative evidence of the visible, day and night, the sun, the moon, and the stars, the circulatory constitution of the seasonal vis- itation of the evident, the perishable. The Qur'anic manifesto documents the revelatory moment when the Unseen violently replaces the visible. The most evident symbolics of the Sign violently condemned by the Qur'an are such tribal idols as al-Lât, al-'Uzza', and Manât, all of which had shrines in Mecca, at-Tâ'if, Nakhla, and many other places. In 71:23, "And they have said: Forsake not your gods. Forsake not Wadd, nor Suwâ', nor Yaghûth and Ya'ûq and Nasr," we know of five other idols. These idols were constitutional to the tribal life and were immediately identified with their images that their believers carried with them, as we know, for example, was the case with Abu Sufyân, a prominent opponent of the Prophet in early Islamic history, who carried the image of al-Lât and al-'Uzza' while on the expedition of Uhud against the nascent Muslim commu- nity (Watt, 1988, pp. 30, 87) . In 4:76, "Those who believe do bat- tle for the cause of Allah; and those who disbelieve do battle for the cause of idols. So fight the minions of the devil. Lo! the dev- il's strategy is ever weak," we probably read a reference to this incident. The gradual assimilation of tribal deities as banât Allah in 16:57, 17:40, 37: 149 among many others, and then as angels, in 34:4, pave the way for the formation of a Monotheist cosmol- ogy, the cosmogonies predicate of an emerging theo-ontology, over which the Transcendental Unseen presides. By the late Sixth century on the Christian calendar, the caravan route in Western Arabia between the ports of Yemen on Indian Ocean and the fertile lands between Byzantine and Sassanid empires at the Mediterranean had a catalytic impact on changing the economic infrastructure of Arabia from nomadic pastoralism to commercial capitalism. Mecca was both a trading terminal and a religious sanctuary.23 The Arabs traded their goods, praised</page><page sequence="45">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 171 their gods, and practiced their paganism at one and the same time. The gradual move from nomadic pastoralism to commer- cial capitalism results in the collapse of 'asabiyyah or group soli- darity in tribal terms and a process of communal disintegration begins to become evident (see Ibn Khaldûn, 1958, Vol. 1, 264 ff.; Vol. 2, 302 ff.ed). Whereas the nomadic pastoralism was con- ducive to strong group affiliation, the rise of commercial capital- ism began to create a powerful merchant class, no longer having any use for outdated loyalties. As ancient tribal solidarities begin to thaw away, and as the new merchant class begins to partake in a thriving commercial capitalism on the borders of the two super- powers of the time (the Byzantines and the Sadssanids), Islam emerges as the defining ideology of a new globalizing Weltan- schauung, taking Judaism as its narrative paradigm, Christianity as its mode of ideological production, the Byzantines and the Sas- sanids as the Imperial model. The violent anti-paganism of the Qur'an is the battle cry of the New Order. The aggressive trans- mutation of iconic tribal Signs into verbal metaphysical Signifiers is the simultaneous metaphoric correspondence that acknowl- edges and accommodates the massive subterranean changes in the moral and material order of the social life. The visible face of the pagan deities begins to disappear, dissolve into thin air, and from the Heavens the Voice of the Unseen begins, and begins to Re-Cite: Read: In the name of thy Lord Who create th, Createth man from a clot.

The Sign has failed, Signifier triumphant. The Face is veiled. The Voice is loquacious. The Man thus alerted into cre- ation now also reads, re-cites, from The Book, His Book, echoing the Voice, now as in post-eternity, in the Presence of the Absence, the Unseen: And every man's augury have We fastened to his own neck, and We shall bring for him on the Day of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open. (And it will be said unto him) : Read thy Book. Thy soul sufficeth as reckoner against thee this day. - The Qur'an 17:13-14 "All signifiers, and first and foremost the written signifier, are derivative with regard to what would wed the voice indissoluably to the mind or to the thought of the signified sense, indeed to the thing itself . . . from its sense thought in the logos or in the infi- nite understanding of God" (Derrida, 1974, p. 11). But "God": The Transcendental Signified beyond recognition, the Sign sup- pressed, the Signifier combatant, triumphant. The Voice of God in the Qur'anic Re-Citation is wedded immediately to the God's Mind, to His Thought, to the Thing Itself. He speaks. Gabriel conveys. Muhammad listens, repeats, and then writes. Because Muhammad writes, then God speaks with His Voice but Teaches with the Pen: Read: And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous, Who teacheth by the pen, Teacheth man that which he knows not. - The Qur'an 96: 3-5 There is no privileging of the spoken word over the written here. The evident, drawn, sculpted Sign is repressed into the vocal Signifier first, but it is then sublimated into the written</page><page sequence="48">174 SOCIAL RESEARCH word, the simulacrum of the Sign. The written word is the simu- lacrum of the repressed Sign, thus the Qur'an both represses and resurrects the Sign in the shape of the written word. "All signifiers . . . are derivative" is correct, derivative though in the sense that they are the mutated Signs. But ". . . and first and foremost the written signifier" confuses the act, betrays the Christian Christo- logical presupposition. So much so that when we get to "The writ- ten signifier is always technical and representative" we have lost the track. And by the time we reach "The notion of the Sign always implies within itself the distinction between signifier and signified," we know we have lost the clue. And no feeble attempt at a subordinate clause, "even if, as Saussure argues, they are dis- tinguished simply as the two faces of one and the same leaf' can do the trick. This is what happens in the Qur'an, the Re-Citation: Evident, drawn, sculpted: The Sign is suppressed (destruction of paganism) . The Sign is narratively transmuted into the Signi- fier, the Name: "In the Name ..." The Name is born: Allah. The immediate Attribute is the denial of the Vision: Allah the Unseen. The Signifier begins to signify, pointing upward, direct- ing away from the scene of the signature. The signification game has started on the site of the Unseen. The Signified is Transcen- dentalized. The game is over. The repressed Sign, however, returns: Joseph and his beautiful Face. Joseph is return of the repressed triumphantly repressed. The battle resumes. The pagans are named and denounced, and Muhammad is summoned to see The Unseen. Why? Because: . . . the Mission which He had bestowed [upon the Prophet] would be bestowed by virtue of Vision [Mushâhidah] and Sight [Nadhar] and not by virtue of Hearing [Samâ] and Utterance [Khabar]. Because Utterance [Khobar] is not like Visual Observation [aLMu'âyinah]. So that when the Prophet described the blessings of the Paradise and the tor- ments of the Hell he would be able to say, "I Saw it," and not</page><page sequence="49">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 175 just "I heard it." Because that is logically more persuasive, it convinces more effectively and powerfully. - al-Maybudî, 1960, Vol. 5, p. 482; emphasis in original by way of writing it in Arabic rather than in Persian Mi'raj, the nocturnal journey of the Prophet who hears God speak to see the Unseen revealed, is the return of the repressed, the Sign denied, for One Final Repression.

See Volume One: 39. 3On the anxiety of not-being-able to see ourselves see Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness, pp. 339-351 and 351-359. 4Because of the absence of the Face, the Qur'anic Semiology that informs the Islamic theo-ontology is exactly the opposite of the Christ- ian Semiology in the direction of its mode of signification. In the Qur'an, we do not have a physical manifestation of the Unseen in a fig- ure like the Christ. In fact in the Qur'anic Christology, the figure of the Christ is just one prophet among many others (see the Qur'an: 2:87, 2:136, 2:253, among many other verses). The Qur'an is emphatic that "Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, then He said unto him: Be! and he is" (3:59). But far more clearly stated is this passage: "O People of the Scripture! Do not exag- gerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning Allah save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and say not "Three" - Cease! (it is) better for you! - Allah is only One God. Far is it removed from His Transcen-</page><page sequence="50">176 SOCIAL RESEARCH dent Majesty that He should have a son. He is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defenderei*" (4:171). Thus Kevin Hart is correct in asserting that: "[B] ecause it regards God as a presence who, after the Fall, represents Himself and is represented by signs, Christian theology is always a study of signs. If we picture God according to His attributes - as omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent - we are plainly imaging Him as a plenitude of pres- ence, both ontologically and epistemologically. By dint of Adam's sin, though, God is for us an absent presence, and so any theology, whatever else it is, must also be a semiology" (Hart, 1989, p.7). The Qur'anic Semiology, however, and obviously the theology it has engendered, emphatically denies the possibility of that physical Sign and in its cate- gorical Monotheism sublimates Allah from any anthropomorphic affili- ation. Thus abstracted into the Unseen that is Central to the Qur'anic narrative, the Facial absence of the Unseen demands an active mutation of the Sign into the Signifier of His Name. This, as a result, is markedly different from the Christian Theo-ontology where the Sign has appeared as Christ. It is precisely that apparition that leads Kevin Hart to remark that: "Like other signs, Christ is both signifier and signified, body and soul" (1989, p. 8). This is over-Christianizing the world into a Universal Semiology. Hart has enough problems on his hand even with Christ alone: "But Christ is also unlike other signs, for here the signified - God - is perfectly expressed in the signifier. He is at once inside and out- side the sign system, since Christ is God, what He signifies is signified in and of itself: He is what Derrida calls a "transcendental signified." Yet Christ is also a transcendental signifier. Miraculously formed, His body is uncontaminated by the very Fall which required the proliferation of signs and the distinction between presence and the sign of a presence" (1989, p. 8). Hart's problem originates in his collapsing of the Sign and the Signifier and thus bypassing a whole generation of logocentric trans- mutation. My essay is to be read as a moment of reflection precisely on this mutation and not taking it for granted by collapsing the Sign and the Signifier into each other, which is an entirely Christian christologi- cal proclivity. 5In my reading of these Qur'anic passage I of course make a most fun- damental distinction between the Sign and the Signifier. My identifica- tion of the Sign with the visible, and meaning-less, Face and the Signifier with the Name, and thus the meaning, of the Unseen is precisely to underline the active mutation of the Sign into the Signifier as the first step away from a Semiotics of sensibilities towards a Hermeneutics, or</page><page sequence="51">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 177 Metaphysics, as Derrida calls it, of positive presences. In the Qur'an, we see clearly the absence of the Sign and the mutation of that absence into the presence of the Signifier. Kevin Hart's application of Derrida's read- ing of Sign categorically collapses the Sign and the Signifier together. This is due to the immediately Christian nature of Hart's Semiology which is also rooted in Derrida's, and before him Husserl's and Hegel's, equally Christian conceptions of the Sign, Derrida and Husserl 's ances- tral faith notwithstanding. Predicated on the Christian conception of the Fall, Hart correctly maintains that: "From God's presence we pass to His absence; from immediacy to mediation; from the perfect congruence of sign and referent to the gap between word and object . . ." (Hart, 1989, p. 5; emphasis added) . In the Qur'anic account the process is precisely the opposite. Although the Edenic account in the Qur'an is equally Bibli- cal, the articulation of the Name of the Signifier in such a way to impli- cate a Transcendental Signified begins with the Absence of the Face of the Unseen and works its way towards the Presence of the Name of the Unseen. It is true, as Derrida has noted, that "logocentricism and the metaphysics of presence . . . [is] the exigent, powerful, systematic, and irrepressible desire for such a [transcendental] signified" (Derrida, 1976, p. 49). But the assertion that "From the moment that there is meaning there are nothing but signs" or that "We think only in signs" (50) in effect de-Faces the Sign of "the absoluteness of its right" by categori- cally collapsing it into the Signifier. The Sign, contrary to the over- Christianized Hegelian-Husserlian premise, on which Derrida builds his deconstructive move, does not signify. It signâtes, or signals, does any- thing but signify. Only Signifiers, already in the domain of the meta- physics of presence, signify. Not Signs. 6In this reading of Joseph's story, I have deliberately stayed clear of Biblical scholarship on its Hebrew version because the Qur'anic version ought to be read independently. But I cannot refrain from expressing my astonishment when I see that the leitmotif of "Face" is identified as the key thematic element in the Yaakov cycle that comes immediately before Yosef, and then the story of Yosef itself being identified as follows: "Even 'face,' the key word of the Yaakov cycle which often meant some- thing negative, is here given a kinder meaning, as the resolution to Yaakov's life" (see The Five Books of Moses published by Schocken, 1983, p. 173). One can read Levinas' attempt at having the Face in its naked- ness representing Infinity as a Hebraic attempt at compensating for the know- ledge that the Infinity does not have a Face. If the Face solicits us from beyond, as Levinas insists, then the beyond is showing itself in the</page><page sequence="52">178 SOCIAL RESEARCH Face. Levinas' attempt ultimately fails because he is too much of a Euro- pean to be a Biblical Hebrew. See his "Trace of the Other" in Taylor Í1986. DD. 345-359). 7A1-Râzî has a crucial commentary as to who the witness to this event was. He reports on the authority of some earlier commentators that when the Egyptian Prince asks Joseph if he has any witnesses Joseph says that an infant in the cradle witnessed the whole event and that the infant would testify on his behalf: "The Prince asked how could an infant in the cradle be a witness. He (Joseph) said, The infant would testify on my behalf.' They approached the infant's cradle. Joseph, Peace be Upon Him, said, *You infant tell us what you saw.' By God's command the infant began to talk and spoke in complete sentences." (al-Râzî, Vol. 3; p. 126). The report is in perfect harmony with the Qur'an's exposing Joseph as the pre-Significatory Sign, now placing the very Sight of a pre- verbalizing infant as the proof of his innocence. 8Notice the difference between this Qur'anic repression of the Sign because of the invisibility of the Face of the Unseen, now returned as repression in the Face of Joseph, and the view, rooted in the Christian Christology and the Face of the Christ as the Sign, that prompts Hart to suggest that: "A discourse is metaphysical, then, if the concept is fash- ioned as a moment of pure presence, and the sign as representing the con- cept in its absence. Within these terms, the sign fails to represent the concept purely and simply; it introduces the complicating elements of materiality and difference which serve to delay and defer the expected recovery of the con- cept This, accordingly, is the basis of the case for valuing the concept over the sign. However, argues Derrida, the sign's failure is structurally determined, and this is the starting-point for his case against the meta- physics of presence" (Hart, 1989, p. 12; emphasis added). This is utterly illogical, for first establishing a mission for the Sign, to Signify, which it has no claim to, and then blaming it for not delivering on a promise it has never made. The confusion is entirely Christian in its imitating the constitution of the Face of Jesus Christ as Re-Presenting God, and then punishing the believers, in effect, for having failed to read that Sign. Not just Derrida but Husserl himself harbors a theory of the Sign entirely Christological in its hidden assumptions. The distinction that Husserl made between two kinds of Sign: the "Expressive" and the "Indicative" (see his Logical Investigations. Translated by Findlay, 1970, Investigation 1, Ch. 1, §1) is at the root of Derrida's reading of the Sign. "By definition there can be no sign without signification, no signifying without the signified." (Derrida, 1973, p. 17). The first part of this sen- tence is completely and exclusively Christian, the second part universal.</page><page sequence="53">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 179 Signs universally sígnate, signal Signs never signify. Signifiers signify. Signs mutate into Signifiers, sensibilities into intelligibilities, before they can correspond to a signified and thus signify. The initial Husserlian division of the Sign into the "expressive" and the "indicative" is itself a fallacy entirely rooted in the Christological confusion of the Sign, doc- trinally mandated to attribute to the Face of Christ a meaning that non- Christian philosophers have no reason to assume and every reason to doubt. The mutation of Signs into Signifiers is always under the pressure of an external, universalizing force, as in the case of the Islamic global- ization of the Judaic particular, at the expense of the Arab pagan plu- ralism. While Islam globalizes the Judaic particular in the direction of mutating the Sign into Signifier, and thus implicates a universal (and not tribal) Transcendental Signified, Christianity universalizes the Judaic particular by yielding to the pagan insistence on the Sign and canonizing a Super-Sign as global. Christianity is in its Totalitarian Abso- lutism of the Sign/Transcendental Signified as Islam is in its Totalitar- ian Absolutism of the Signifier/Transcendental Signified. 9For an account of the Khârijîte sub-sect of the Maymûniyya exclud- ing the Joseph chapter from their version of the Qur'an see Bell and Watt, 1970, p. 46. Medieval Qur'anic commentaries are extraordinarily explicit in their specific articulation of the sexual innuendoes of the text. The phrase . "And when they saw him they exalted him" in 12:31, for example, is read by al-Râzî, on authority of the very father of Qur'anic commentators Ibn 'Abbas, as meaning the women having an instantaneous "menstruation" (hayd), or perhaps more accurately an orgasm, when they see Joseph (see al-Râzî 1983, Volume Three: 128). The account of menstruation may still be true but in the narrative of Abu al-Fadl Rashîd al-Dîn al-Maybudî who in his Kashf al-Asrâr wa Vddat al-Abrâr (composed in 520/1126) reports that among the Egyptian women there was one pre-adolescent girl who suddenly had her first menstruation when she saw Joseph. She prayed to God Almighty and pleaded with Him to save her from embarrassment. It was at this moment that God made all women have a simultaneous menstruation and cut their hands so that their blood will mix and cover that young girl's embarrassment. For al-Maybudî's account see Abu al-Fadl Rashîd al-Dîn al-Maybudî, Kashf al-Asrâr wa Vddat air 'Abrâr, edited by Ali Asghar Hekmat,Vol. 5, p. 61. 10There are wonderful folkloric accounts of how we have the "cuts" in the palm of our hands precisely where our ancestral mothers cut their hands when they saw Joseph and were so distracted by his beauty that instead of cutting the orange they held in their hands they cut their</page><page sequence="54">180 SOCIAL RESEARCH hands. In this account, every time we look at the palms of our own hands we are in effect reminded of the beauty of Joseph, of the one time that Truth manifested itself in its beautiful Face and then had to hide Itself. A1The reference to the meaning of the name Nu man is missing in al- Râzî's account. 12This resistance points to a more universal insight about the nature of the Sign. The categorical resistance of the Sign to its mutation into the Signifier is equally evident when the "difference" between the Sign and its Christologically-based presumption of pointing to a Signified is noted. Here is the case: Since it always functions in the absence of a presence, the sign has no self-presence by which its intelligible content can withstand the accidents of empirical differences. The sign always works with two modes of repetition: its task, as understood metaphysically, is to repeat its originating presence, in order that the intelligible be repeated in the sensible. But the sign, since it is a sign, is also open to being repeated itself, so the sensible mark can always be repeated outside its original context. Indeed, the sign cannot be what it is without this possibility of repetition. The first mode of repetition seeks to preserve the sign's intelligible content, while the second mode of repetition puts the identity of that intelligi- ble content in jeopardy. And the problem is that the sign can never put that second mode of repetition out of play: the meta- physical task of the sign is forever stymied by the sign itself (Hart, 1989, p. 12). This is a brilliant semiological moment when the Sign is putting a stiff resis- tance to its over-Christianized metaphysicalization. The Christian in Hart thrives in the Husserlian distinction between the "Expressive" and the "Indicative" by giving two "modes" to the signal singularity of the Sign and fallaciously assigning to Sign an "intelligible content," but the pagan philosopher in him sees the plain fact that when the Sign is just "Itself it signifies nothing or, more accurately, it does not signify and thus has no ulterior "mode" other than being a pre-significatory Sign. Derrida himself perfectly recognizes the trap in which not just Husserl but Saussure is fallen. In his 1968 interview with Julia Kristeva he notes that There is at least one moment at which Saussure must renounce drawing all the conclusions from the critical work he has under-</page><page sequence="55">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 181 taken, and that is the not fortuitous moment when he resigns himself to using the word 'sign,' lacking anything better. After having justified the introduction of the words 'signified' and 'sig- nifier,' Saussure writes: 'As for sign, if we retain it, it is because we find nothing else to replace it, everyday language suggesting no other" (Derrida, 1981, p. 19). This is most peculiar when Saussure expects the "everyday language" to suggest something other than the word "Sign" as the verbal site of the organic link between the Signifier and the Signified. In a moment of irresistible cross-hermeneutic weakness, Derrida concurs with Saussure in acknowledging this inability of the "everyday language: "And, in effect, it is difficult to see how one could evacuate the sign when one has begun by proposing the opposition signified/signifier" (19). In Speech and Phenomena too, Derrida again falls into this trap and keeps oscillat- ing among French, German, and even English to narrow in on the pos- sibility of the oxymoronic "meaningful signs" (Derrida, 1973, p.18). But in Positions he does come clean and categorically recognizes that: "'everyday language' is not innocent or neutral. It is the language of Western [he should more accurately say Christian] metaphysics, and it carries with it not only a considerable number of presuppositions of all types, but also presuppositions inseparable from metaphysics, which, although little attended to, are knotted into a system" (Derrida, 1981, p. 19). But ultimately, even Derrida cannot see the Sign as pre-Significa- tory. One may in fact argue that Derrida's entire deconstructive project is predicated on presuming as valid the entirely unexamined, Christian Christologically predicated, Husserlian dichotomy between the "Expres- sive" and the "Indicative" functions of Signs, thus failing to see the already mutated transition of the Sign into the Signifier by that very dichotomy, and then making a federal case out of the residue of signifi- cations that the Sign is ought to make and yet "fails" to make. The rea- son that Christian theology is so positively elated with Derrida, especially the so-called "negative theology," is this continued Christian Christolog- ical predicates of the Face of the Transcendental Signified being evident in the Sign (Face) of God. The unabashed, violent, and categorical monotheism of the Qur'an denies that possibility, has to keep the Face of the Unseen unseen, and thus tacitly recognize that Signs signify noth- ing or, more accurately, do not signify before they are aggressively mutated into Signifiers, and thus "In the Name of God . . . ." 13Pickthall adds a parenthetical "(again)" before "a seer." There is no</page><page sequence="56">182 SOCIAL RESEARCH such thing in the original, "ya'ti basiran." It is important that we see Jacob as gaining a new kind of in/sight. 14I have kept Pickthall's "he became a seer once more" but "fa-artadda basiran" is better translated "he returned to being a seer." Again the point is that there is a constitutional difference between the way Jacob sees now and the way he used to see. Joseph's Face, the Sign of the Unseen, is at stake. 15I have kept Pickthall's "How many a portent" but "ka-ayyin min 'ayatin is far more accurately translated "How many a sign." 16The resistance of the Sign to its aggressive transmutation into the Signifier here in the Qur'an finds ample evidence in the practice of paganism. We still have much to learn from that resistance in a philo- sophical language subconsciously Christian in its Semiology/Christol- ogy. Notice that already in Peirce himself we see this confusion between the Sign and the Signifier. "A sign is an object which stands for another to some mind" (Hoopes, 1991, p. 141). As an object, Sign stands for nothing other than itself, unless and until it is violently mutated, its autonomy transgressed, and made into a Signifier, at which point, and only at which point, it "stands for" something else "to some mind." Thus even a particular mutation of a Sign, say a Cross, into a Signifier, say Cru- cifixion of Jesus Christ the Son of God, is limited to a particular Chris- tological doctrine. The Sign of the Cross Itself means nothing to a Muslim or a Hindu unless and until it has doctrinally been mutated into yet another kind of Signifier in those religious cultures. Thus Peirce's assertion that "a sign must have some real connection with the thing it signifies so that when the object is present or is so as the sign signifies it to be, the sign shall so signify it and otherwise not" (141) not only suf- fers from a collapsing of the Sign into the Signifier but it also universal- izes the particular mutation of a Sign into a Signifier, a habit to which Christological Christianity is particularly wont. Hegel's Semiology, how- ever, is acutely aware of the violence that the transmutation of the Sign into the Signifier involves. "The sign," Hegel proposed, "is some imme- diate intuition, representing a totally different import from what naturally belongs to it; it is the pyramid into which a foreign soul has been con- veyed, and where it is conserved" (Quoted in Derrida, 1982, pp. 83-84. Emphasis added). It is crucial here to note that the soul that the Egypt- ian Pharaonic culture force-migrates into the Sign of the pyramid and thus turns it into a Signifier of immortality is very different from the soul that Hegel's own constitutionally Christian culture force-migrates into that very Sign. Derrida shrewdly notes and capitalizes on this crucial moment and asserts: "This is why the immediate intuition of the signi-</page><page sequence="57">IN THE ABSENCE OF THE FACE 183 fier [which he still confuses with the Sign] represents an entirely other con- tent than that which it has for itself, entirely other than that whose full presence refers only to itselP (84). Hegel clearly sees the irreducible character of the Sign when he compares it to a Symbol: "Therefore it is a different thing when a sign is to be a symbol The lion, for example, is taken as a symbol of magnanimity, the fox for cunning, the circle for eternity, the triangle for Trinity" (Quoted in Derrida, p. 84). Symbol- ization of the Sign is just one particular case of the universal violation perpetrated on the Sign by forcing it to become a Signifier and point to a Signified and thus, ipso facto, necessitate a Transcendental Signified that holds the whole game together. In and of themselves, lions, foxes, and circles mean nothing. They are just visual sights: Signs. 17Zoleikha's description of Joseph's facial beauty precedes a particu- larly erotic moment in the scene of seduction that from Ibn Abbas for- ward most commentators have reported. In such mystical commentaries as that of al-Maybudî, Zoleikha in fact gradually assumes a very positive character. She abandons her idolatry, becomes a true Muslim, and after the death of her husband marries Joseph. 18The most extensive examination of the pagan practice of worship- ping allah as one among many deities is to be found in the work of W. Montgomery Watt (1971, 1981, 1988). 19The prophet, reportedly, became angry and cursed 'Atbah Abî Lahab and asked God to let loose a beast upon him. 'Atbah was soon killed by a lion on a business trip with his father Abu Lahab in Syria (al- Maybudî, Volume Three, p. 353). For a reading of a similarly political significance of paganism posing a threat to Christianity, see Pelikan (1974, Vol. 2, Ch. 3). For an historical extension of it to modernity see Mitchell (1986, p. 7). Mitchell correctly catches Barthes in his imperi- alist mandate that "linguistics is not a part of the general science of signs, even a privileged part, it is a semiology which is part of linguistics." (Roland Barthes in Elements of Semiology, as quoted in Mitchell, 1986, p. 56). But like Barthes, Mitchell himself fails to rescue the unruly insur- rectionary defiance of the Sign from Christian iconography. Barthes is totally lost to linguistics. Mitchell does not take his semiology to its dis- turbine conclusions. 20In correspondence with the very famous incidence with Adam in the Qur'an 2:31: "And He taught Adam all the names 21These so-called "Satanic Verses," because according to some accounts the Prophet first uttered and then retracted them, explaining that he subsequently realized that Satan had revealed them to him, are quoted in Bell and Watt (1970, p. 55). A slightly different version is in</page><page sequence="58">184 SOCIAL RESEARCH Watt (1988, p. 86): ". . . These are the gharânîq exalted; their interces- sion is to be hoped for; such as they forget not." "Gharânîq," meaning "high-flying cranes" is an apparent reference to these three deities. 22For an account of the economic changes predicating the rise of Islam see Watt, Muhammad at Mecca (1953) and Muhammad at Medina (1956). Equally insightful is Watt's Islam and the Integration of Society (1961, especially pp. 4-42). 23See W. Montgomery Watt 1988 for an account of Arabia at the time of the Prophet.
