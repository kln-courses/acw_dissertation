<plain_text><page sequence="1">"^ ' ' ' '" ' ' '~/, mi m w g MEf^fl WE i[ lift Canon laura norder The Pope's encyclical Veritatis Splendor, published last month, offered reassurance to religious conservatives north and south. NEIL MIDDLETON seeks to trouble them. In its sophisticated dissection of the elements of the conflict in Northern Ireland, the Opsahl report reaffirmed the important, if obvious, point that it has a religious dimension. Non-Christians sometimes feel the doctrinal dif ferences between Paisleyite Protestantism and Vati can Catholicism are as obscure as those between the angels balanced on the pin. The problem presented to the rest of the world is that the doctrinal assertions of Protestant demagogues and the Catholic hierar chy both seek to regulate human behaviour, and are thus directly political. Central to the politics of much ecclesiastical utter ance is the issue of the rights of women. The need to clarify some issues in the gender politics of Irish Christian sectaries has become more urgent since the publication of the present Pope's circular letter to the bishops, Veritatis Splendor?which reasserts, by its renewed insistence on the primacy of the 'magisterium' of the church, the hierarchical male hegemony. In this the Rev Paisley and his peers stand solidly united with John Paul II and the Catholic bishops of Ireland. Since 1990 the United Nations Development Pro gramme has published an annual Human Develop ment Report. It includes comparative indices of development: the Human Development Index and, in some years, the Human Freedom Index. The elements in the HDI are life expectancy, access to education and income. Countries are ranked on a scale of 0-1. HDI tables appear in two forms. The first merely lists countries in order of their overall development. In 1993 the republic came 21st, barely ahead of Italy, 20 Fortnight November 1993</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT AFFAIRS Spain, and Greece. As the position of any country is partly determined by its relative wealth (the US ranks sixth on 0.976), the republic's indifferent performance can be attributed, in part, to its com parative poverty. But the second method disaggregates the HDI to indicate the comparative disadvantage of women: it measures the relative longevity, access to education and income of women and men. In this year's report, Britain came tenth in the overall HDI, with a 'score' of 0.964, but the gender-sensitive index was 0.818? a female HDI only 85 per cent that of the male. Northern Ireland is treated as part of Britain, and, given the Opsahl analysis of the north's political exclusion of women, one may be sure that the region contributes handsomely to Britain's wretched per formance. The republic, however, is no better. This year the gender-sensitive index reduced its 'score' from 0.925 to 0.72, which means its HDI for women is only 78 per cent of that for men. This is worse than the record of, for example, Portugal, Italy and Paraguay. Given that Irish women live some 8 per cent longer than Irish men, the republic would seem, propor tionately, to be among the most gender-discrimina tory states in the world, when the other two index elements (education and income) are considered. Indeed, while in real terms it is far richer than, say, Myanmar?a male-dominated military dictatorship where women's development runs at 76.3 per cent of men's?in relative terms the republic is only margin ally ahead. In the Human Freedom Index, most recently published in 1991, countries are listed as having a high, medium or low ranking. The republic figures in the medium category, below Venezuela, Italy, Papua New Guinea and Portugal. Spain is the only west European country among the other three in the medium group with a more restrictive record than the republic. Among the 39 indicators used in the HFI are the right to travel freely at home and abroad, freedom from censorship, the personal right to sexual equal ity in divorce proceedings and the personal right to determine the number of one's children. The hold of women in the republic on those freedoms is either tenuous or non-existent. To a substantial degree, women in Northern Ireland face the same disadvan tages as their sisters across the border, either as a consequence of repressive laws or of their enclosed religious societies. Even though, in the republic, the major battle over access to contraception has been won, many important skirmishes remain to be fought?not least because of the reactionary fundamentalism of Pope John Paul II. Access to information about abortion has been somewhat ambiguously affirmed by the courts and last November's referendum, though how that will come out in legislation has yet to be seen. Divorce is not yet recognised and the battle over abortion 'substantively' is on. The bizarre threat to the right of pregnant women to travel seems to have vanished, but it would be unwise to assume there is no further need to defend it. When framing the constitution of 1937, Eamon de Valera and his allies, not least in the hierarchy, would have preferred it to be Catholic. They ended with a compromise and gave, in article 44, a 'special posi tion' to Catholicism as the religion of the majority. Not until the referendum of 1972 was that removed. Beginning with its preamble, the document is per meated with religious language, largely as a conse quence of de Valera's main sources of inspiration, which included the socio-political pronouncements of Popes Pius VII, Leo XIII and Pius XL De Valera's misogyny and the influence of right wing, Catholic and pre-Nazi Austria are reflected in article 41 of the constitution. Sections 1 and 2 are disturbingly reminiscent of the infamous fascist Kinder, Kirche, Kuche slogan?insisting that a wom an's place, unlike a man's, is in the home. Section 3 not only forbids the passing of laws permitting di vorce, but also insists that those whose foreign mar riages are recognised by the state will not have their equally foreign divorces so accepted. The justification for this article, both in its formu lation and by those who still defend it, lies in what is called 'protection' of the family. The unionist obses sion with articles 2 and 3 is well known, but in remaining silent on article 41 they are, yet again, closing ranks with their Catholic brothers in the oppression of women. In veritatis splendor, the pope asserts that, while not demanding any particular theological view, the 'magisterium' of the church must, nonetheless, point to some inalienable truths?consequences of 'the' Truth. 'Magisterium' is a peculiar word: it sounds masculine, though many theologians have thought of it as a sort of consensus among all the 'people of God', women included. The Pope clearly prefers the narrower definition, which more or less confines it to the decrees of some councils, the agreed teaching of the bishops and some papal pronouncements. Its function is to preserve and develop the 'deposit of revelation' contained in scripture and tradition. Authority for this relies on a circular argument, which declares that what it decrees is binding be cause guaranteed by God who, in Christ, set up the magisterium by appointing the apostles in the first place. A reductionist, but not entirely unwarranted, view of the Christian position would be that God appointed men, not women, as natural rulers of the church?and of everything else except the kitchen. John Paul II provides a selective and largely unfocused list of things he describes as 'intrinsically' evil, much of it unexceptionable. But in it?sepa rate, it should be noted, from homicide and geno cide?comes abortion, which he describes as an act hostile to life. He has a quite separate category of acts 'the Rev Paisley and his peers stand solidly united with John Paul II and the Catholic bishops of Ireland' NOVEMBER 1993 FORTNIGHT 21</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT AFFAIRS | which, somewhat bafflingly, he describes not as 'evil' but 'morally unacceptable': this includes contracep tion, direct sterilisation, auto-eroticism, pre-marital sex, homosexual relations (why are so many senior Christian clerics homophobic?) and artificial in semination. As he bases his condemnation of the latter list on some strongly-worded first-century Chris tian propaganda (1st Corinthians 6:9-10), we may safely assume that there is not much to choose between his two categories. Much of the document is to do with defending the authority of the magisterium in governing morality and in explaining what that means. Using a dubious claim to universalism, Catholic hierarchs have fre quently achieved a sleight of hand in suggesting an equation between the public needs of civil law and the canons of the patriarchal morality embodied in their sect. Religious fundamentalists?and, come to that, Iranian-style ayatollahs?in the north have played much the same trick. It is scarcely surprising that Dr Dermot Roan tree, writing in the Irish Times last month, should claim: "The Church is not a political establishment... and it is unreasonable to expect it to abide by the same ground rules ... as one finds in a democracy." All churches are political establishments, of course, simply by virtue of their constant intervention in the regulation of human behaviour. What some of the bishops of Ireland and their more eccentric and oddly named supporters?like the 'Youth Defence League' or 'Family Solidarity'? have refused to understand is what is appropriate to constitutions, what should be left to legislation and what is a matter for private concern (here again, the Protestant demagogues in the north are at one with the Catholic bishops). Nowhere is this more appar ent than in the case of contraception. The Roman position on this issue is philosophi cally and, I am informed by some theologians, theo logically incoherent. It is regarded with derision by most non-Christians and by many Christians. For the religious right to try to impose its curious and un healthy practices in this matter is a direct attack on the democratic process, on public health and, above all, on women's rights and the right of everyone to determine the size of her or his family. Most states have laws about the age of consent?to contain child abuse?but to fight for a legally en forceable minimum age at which contraceptives can be obtained is something else. The insanity of deny ing contraceptives to sexually active human beings of whatever age is simply to encourage unwanted pregnancies, to reinforce the subordinate position of women and to increase the rate of abortion. Civil divorce is another instance of confusion. Whatever Christians may choose to believe about the sacrament of marriage, the agreement to marry is also a contract, largely about property and financial and physical support. Until comparatively recently, the wife and all her possessions became the property of the husband. Most European countries have moved beyond that barbarism, even if they are still far from reaching gender equality in marriage. Rather than rehearse all the ways in which the republic lags behind, one need only recall that of the payment of child benefit to the father. All normal contracts may be ended?even those entered into in perpetuity?if the parties fail to meet the terms. In a world in which men hold most of the power, to refuse to allow civil divorce when the terms of the contract, which include those unquantifiable elements in mutual support, no longer obtain, is simply to exploit women. In the cases of both contraception and the mar riage contract, consenting religious couples in pri vate are entitled to accept any restrictions they choose, so long as they do not insist the rest of the world join in. Even so, Christian women might feel they were getting a raw deal from rules imposed by ecclesiastics claiming a peculiarly male right to make the deci sions. Nonetheless, if some Christians see contracep tion as morally unacceptable, that is their business. In the case of divorce the matter is a little more complex, as even religious marriages are also civil events. The religious objection to divorce might, more rationally, be confined to re-marriage. Once more, in any event, Christians need not avail them selves of what should be a civil right if they choose not to do so. Contraception is not a matter for legal regulation but for personal and responsible decision. Divorce is not a matter for constitutions and the role of the law is to ensure its equitable administration. Both have to do with protecting the real, everyday family and with promoting the rights of women. But conservative Christians have muddied the waters yet further. They have suggested that abor tion, in addition to being 'murder', is part of a concerted attack on the only form of close human inter-gender relationships they are prepared to coun tenance. Hence they treat abortion, divorce and contraception as some wicked continuum, one prac tice leading to another. Disentangling matters is harder here, if only be cause many people who do not share that Christian view of sexual morality, gender politics or what constitutes a human being also object to, or are at least made uncomfortable by, abortion. Nonethe less, it is important to register just how the campaign against permitting abortion in Ireland?on either side of the border?fits into a specifically religious view of people and the gender politics of many of the churches. Zealots demonstrating outside abortion clinics or the homes of politicians who disagree with them argue that abortion is 'murder'. They produce two lines in support of this view. The first is that from the 'moment of conception' the fertilised ovum is ensouled and thus becomes human life. The second 22 Fortnight November 1993</page><page sequence="4">| CURRENT AFFAIRS | is that because, at a relatively early stage of develop ment, a foetus looks human, a human life is being destroyed. Conception, of course, is a 'moment' notoriously difficult to describe?'process' might be a better word. But 'souls' are even harder to describe, and many see no reason to believe that they exist or accept them as defining humanity. The second argu ment conveniently rests on the first, so that Chris tians who adopt it do not feel the need to find any other way of thinking about the nature of human ity?they merely assert abortion is destruction of a human life. Those who hold to a view of humanity that de pends on consciousness, language and inter relationships reject the extremist Christian view. In the normal course of events a foetus may well be born into humanity, but until it is one cannot, in any ordinary, non-anthropomorphic way, treat it as a fellow human being. Abortion is not murder and one should not be bludgeoned by a lumpen Christi anity into supposing that it is. In those countries in which abortion is permitted it is usually confined to the time when the foetus is thought not capable of independent existence, and most err on the side of caution. There is a substantial argument which says that abortion should not be a matter of law at all, but solely of the judgment of the women concerned?with the support and best ad vice that partners, friends, family, counsellors and even doctors (where a medical point might be at issue) can give. In a male world, however, it is hard to imagine a rapid move towards such a recognition of women's humanity and their human right to make such deci sions. Thus it becomes necessary to campaign for laws which permit abortion?not because one wants either to encourage or discourage it, but because opposition largely rests on an arcane belief and the determination of the political and Christian right to control women. A recent article in the Furrow by John McAreavy, a professor of canon law, began: 'The issue of abor tion is 'in the air' at the moment, primarily for political reasons." By opening thus, Prof McAreavy was in grave danger of suggesting that 'political reasons' are somehow a little suspect?otherwise, it is a sentence curiously devoid of meaning. Politics is one of the principal modes of social articulation and, for all those in a secular society who do not believe in a god, it is a major sphere in which ethical principles are hammered out?a point made in extenso, variously, by Aristotle in his Politics and Plato in his Laws. Abortion is certainly raised for 'political' reasons: the basic structures of democracy are at issue, as well as the right of individual women to determine their own destinies. One may freely agree that pregnant Christians have the same right as everyone else not to have an abortion. What they do not have, in a pluralist and secular world, is the right to insist that their particu lar religious preferences shall govern everyone else. In the matter of controlling the lives of women, there is little to choose between the two parts of this island. For either reasonably to be regarded as demo cratic, the first step each must take is towards secularisation?above all, to abandon laws and cus toms that limit the rights of women. ^ Robin Wilson reviews John Osmond's The Democratic Challenge on p51 &amp;* I'M mm it wwr w NOVEMBER 1993 F O R T N I G H T 23</page></plain_text>
