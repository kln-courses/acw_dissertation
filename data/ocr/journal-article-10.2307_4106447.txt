SYMPOSIUM: THE QUANTUM THEORY: HOW FAR DOES IT MODIFY THE MATHEMATICAL, THE PHYSICAL AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS OF CONTINUITY ? J. W. NICHOLSON, DOROTHY WRINCH, F. A. LINDEMANN, AND H. WILDON CARR. I. By J. W. NICHOLSON. WHEN the unrest of the present age-in regard to the funda- mental principles of physics-has become so urgent that the whole of physics falls into two mutually exclusive categories, the time arises to take stock of the new matter and to determine in what respects-from any ultimate philosophical aspect of the structure of the universe-old conceptions have been overthrown and new ones have shown themselves capable of replacing them. We mean this, of course, only in a certain sense, for it is doubtful whether any new conceptions, which can go far in an interpretation of experience, remain to be found. They are all present to us, and it is only their validity or scope of usefulness which is in question. From a philosophical standpoint, all that happens is ultimately reducible to the existence of certain entities-only one, B2</page><page sequence="2">20 J. W. NICHOLSON. perhaps-which, with the added conception of "change," can change in certain ways. Perhaps, to an individual thinking mind, there is one fundamental mode of thought. Not without reason, in earlier days, was the interpretation of physical phenomena referred, by those who could not conceive action at a distance, to an all-pervading medium which propagated action, which was continuous, and whose mode of working involved no violent change without relation to any duration of time in which the change occurred. All physical phenomena, as they reach the human mind, appear inseparably related to time-duration, even if we have reached a point of view of time which can question, with Prof. Whitehead, whether it is a succession of instants or of durations. We see a cloud in the sky at 12 noon, we describe it as nearer to us at 12.5, and the phenomenon which has occurred cannot be dissociated from a 5-minute interval, in which we have been conscious beings, and can register the appearance of the cloud to our senses at any intervening moment. In the normal mind, even if it made no observation of its own, there exists a time, 12.3, at which some other conscious being made an observation of the cloud, with a conclusion, as to the rate of its approach, which would fit, by a simple mathematical formula, the phenomenon which it observed for itself at 12.5, and from which that phenomenon was deducible by pure logic. Such matters seem elementary. But the first thing the quantum theory does is to issue an invitation to us to discard them. Let us take the subject of the structure of a hydrogen atom, on the basis of Bohr's theory of quanta. We picture a mass of positive electricity, so solid as to be incapable of motion which is relevant. Round it circulates a very mobile electron- in one of a sequence of possible orbits, defined after a manner to which we shall refer later. If we may systematize the specifica- tion, we may say, with Bohr, that atomic angular momentum must have a set of quite discrete values, the penultimate, or lowest</page><page sequence="3">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 21 but one, being actually double that in the ultimate or normal configuration, while nothing capable of description as a hydrogen atom can exist between. We must, if the atom is to change from one of these configurations to the other, not attempt to visualize an intermediate stage. The quantum theory does not deny the ultimate possibility of this, but is entirely silent as to its existence, and as to any question of time-duration which can be concerned, and which our mind devines as necessary to any such passage. At this point, being aware that at a later stage I wish to introduce certain considerations which are of a somewhat more mathematical nature, I propose to approach the subject in a vein of what, to some readers, may seem light comedy, but of what I believe to be very fundamental, in so far as it demon- strates certain relations of the quantum theory to ordinary experience and modes of thought. I will compare the electron in a hydrogen atom to a passenger on the Underground Railway. An electron in a hydrogen atom can take up a " normal " configuration, with a minimum angular momentum, or one with an angular momentum which is any mulitple of this value. If it gets, for any reason, any one of these values, it can remain with it, but, in the presence of any disturbing agency, may change to another, which can be any other possible one. We have no criteria for determining which one it will select or is compelled to adopt. Mr. G. K. Chesterton once said, in a protest against the expected, that he would wish that if he entered the Tube at Golders Green the next station were not so definite but might be Sloane Square on some occasion. If he had been an electron, and stations had been " stationary states " of an atom, persisting for a duration and then changing to other states, he would have had his wish, for the train might then equally well have arrived next at any station on the whole Metropolitan system. Such is the chaos of the quantum theory-it is purely a matter of chance what happens</page><page sequence="4">22 J. W. NICHOLSON. next, and all possible happenings in an atom are determined solely by a consideration of probability. They can be analysed, of course, by the statistical method, with results appropriate to macroscopic phenomena-as must of course be the case in any theory-and the whole of physics, in so far as it is macroscopic, is in this sense independent of the quantum theory. It may be that a chaos of this particular type can strike philosophers of certain modes of thought as irrelevant. For it is always possible to take the view, as may physicists do, that the quantum theory as envisaged is ultimately expressible in a mechanistic form which would conform to our more ordinary macroscopic dynamics. In short, we, in our present perceptions of the theory, are very much in the position of Aristotle in his account of the body falling to the earth, and reach paradoxical positions through mere ignorance of the existence of some entities which are vital to a rational statement. When we do not follow the passage of an atom between two states, we are not saying-though some exponents almost say that we are-that no such passage is to be imagined, but merely that we have not an appropriate mechanical language for its description on a logical basis. For the one solid fact in the quantum theory which marks it out from any other is the existence of the universal constant h of Planck. This is not a constant of energy. While it makes us unable to conceive energy as existing ultimately in other than " bundles," the amount in any bundle, even if it is the smallest possible bundle, depends upon its circumstances. For in all systems containing energy, there is a "frequency " which depends on the system and varies from one to another, not, sometimes, even having a commensurable relation between its values in two of them. The energy in a system is hi, if v is the " frequency," and perhaps any whole multiple of it, so that the real constant of nature is the quotient of energy and frequency, or product of energy and time. For this mysterious " frequency "</page><page sequence="5">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 23 in the quantum theory has some relation to our ordinary con- ception of the frequency of a wave, and, in fact, is identical with it when the energy is localized in a wave. But when it is not, it can hardly be said to be more than a mathematical symbol, for we have no real conception of any language in which a physical meaning can be given to it, except that it is bound up in some way with a duration of time to which it is inversely proportional, and is in some way analogous to a number of alternations of something per second. Something structural, not necessarily an aether, would seem to be presupposed. An unknown x- perhaps a medium-is capable of alternation in its manifestations. We are then perilously near the definition of the aether as the nominative of the verb to undulate. I will pass at once to the point which, in my opinion, is the one we really wish to discuss. Given a universal constant of nature, what is its philosophical significance ? For our purposes, the quantum theory has intro- duced a new constant of nature-an action, or product of energy and time-but, in so doing, has it introduced anything of a type which was not present in our minds before ? I would contend that the nature of any such new constant, in so far as it is ex- pressible in physical language, is of no real importance. At the same time, some remarks on the new constant are perhaps not entirely out of place. Action is not a term of real significance to one who has not studied mathematics profoundly, and become familiar with the fact that there exists a conception of action which, by taking only stationary values, leads to all the ordinary dynamical formulation of physics. To one who has not done this, and has conceptions of mechanical entities of a simpler nature, I would refer back to a date at which the conception of the work done by a force-the product of the force and the distance through which it moved a body-was existent, while the "energy " it produced in the body it moved was defined only vaguely as " kinetic energy." Now we know that the kinetic energy or</page><page sequence="6">24 J. W. NICHOLSON. energy possessed by a body in virtue of its motion, depends on the square of its velocity; that the kinetic energy produced by a force is measured by the work which the force has done; that energy and work are synonymous terms, and are physically inter- changeable and of the same type-even that all work or potential energy is ultimately energy of motion, represented in other forms, in our mathematical analysis, solely on account of our ignorance of a real physical description of the processes-which are going on. The phenomena of magnetism constitute an example, where much consistent and satisfactory theory can be developed, capable even of predicting new results, on a basis of the two-fluid theory of magnetism-but we now know that all magnetic forces are in fact best described as due to the motions of electrical charges. Thus, in our interpretation of nature, we can, like those before us, use two quite different concepts, in appearances which are in fact the same. Perhaps we still do so. I have emphasized always the fact that action and angular momentum are identical in type, in the same sense as energy and work. May we conclude that the new ultimate constant of nature is an " angular momentum," -always and not only in the cases in which the quantum theory has required that it should be ? If this be so, we have at least a possibility that the micro- scopic universe may ultimately be expressed in language which a physicist, with a sense of logic, may accept. For the conception of angular momentum is one which admits this type of possibility. I would like to return now to my previous statement that the nature of the new universal constant is not relevant to our dis- cussion, and that it introduces nothing which has not already been introduced by the existence of any universal constant of nature. For simplification, I shall consider only the most obvious case, in the belief that the argument is quite general. Let us presuppose that a universal length exists in nature, and let us view this length as one intimately associated with the structure of some " medium "</page><page sequence="7">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 25 pervading the universe-which, for convenience, we shall call the vather-or with some entity whose changes constitute the universe. If language appropriate to a material form of medium be allowed-as, in my view, it must be if any logical account is possible on the basis of our modes of thought in any possible approach to a discussion of physical phenomena-it may be admitted that all universal constants of length in the universe are derived ultimately from the pervading length in this structure. Elsewhere, in fact, some years ago, I showed that the universality of the radius of an electron could be replaced by a universal line-constant in an aether in which the electron was only a structure-after the manner of a knot, but a structure which extended indefinitely, while becoming inappreciable to any measurement within a few "radii." In fact, the electron, so far from being a rigid kind of entity confined to a definite region of space, became all-pervading, and entirely continuous, in so far as a continuous state of strain, in an aother which itself possessed a structure of some form requiring a line-constant, could be regarded as continuous. To this latter problem we must come, but before doing so, I would lay emphasis on the fact that there is nothing in the nature of a line-constant pervading the universe which is foreign to the nature of any other pervading constant which can involve, in addition to length, time. If our consideration of phenomena, as the manifestation of the behaviour of some " medium " with a structure involving a universal length, lead us to the conclusion, as I think it does, that the ultimate continuity or discontinuity of the universe is solely a question of the ultimate continuity or otherwise of this " medium," then we must equally come to the conclusion that any other universal constant, involving a more complex consideration of structure- for instance, one consisting of rotational motions, with definite angular moments-is in the same category. The continuity or otherwise of physical phenomena then rests with the continuity</page><page sequence="8">26 J. W. NICHOLSON. of some " medium" or " substance," by which I understand a more general conception than the aether-just the " something" or "x" whose changes constitute phenomena. Now a line-structure, in the sense necessary to produce a universal length, may not involve any discontinuity. It does not involve us in the view of a mesh-like medium with gaps or discontinuities, like a three-dimensional analogue of a table- cloth. It might equally well be said that a continuous ocean covered by water-waves had a structure, for there is a length associated with them-their wave length-which, so long as they are present, is a constant of the liquid medium. By analogy, we can contemplate the possibility of any constant as merely an interval, in a continuous " medium," in which some manifestation passes from one maximum value to the next minimum, but in quite a continuous way. I see no mode of removing this possi- bility and consequently of seeing any possibility that we can ultimately imagine any form of physical discontinuity which is essentially different from mathematical discontinuity. Thus it would seem that one part of our title becomes bereft of meaning in a possible mode of thought on physical phenomena. Mathe- matical discontinuity is the subject we are then driven to, and it is not part of my province.</page><page sequence="9">II. By DOROTHY WRINCH. THE QUANTUM THEORY IN RELATION TO THE LOGICAL CONCEPT OF CONTINUITY. THE Quantum Theory, in common with the Theory of Relativity, is of great interest and of vast importance to the student of Scientific Methodology. The relation of logical concepts to scientific theory is a study as yet in its infancy. Yet, it is precisely the nature of this relation which is the critical issue in the Quantum Theory regarded as a part of the fabric of modern science. Mathematics, or Logic-if we may use this latter term to denote the general theory of the structure of concepts and so to include the first-is essentially concerned with possibilities and not with actualities. When it is introduced into scientific theorizing it provides information as to what may happen, and never any information as to what does happen in fact. Given the relevant mathematical theorems, it is for the Natural Sciences to discuss the actual phenomena of the external world. Thus, in the Quantum Theory, an important and relevant mathematical theorem states that the angular momentum h associated with an orbit described by a particle moving under a central force varying inversely as the square of the distance of the particle from the centre of force, is given by h2 = pl where 1 is the semi-latus rectum of the conic traced out by the particle, p being the force exerted on a particle of unit mass at unit distance from the centre of force. This theorem, here stated for convenience in physical terms, is a theorem of</page><page sequence="10">28 DOROTHY WRINCH. mathematics. It asserts a specific value for the length of the latus rectum of the path of the particle, given the value of kt the strength of the force and h the angular momentum in the orbit. It is now for physics to specify which, if any, of these possible orbits actually occur in the external world. And it is at this point that a new assumption already mentioned in this symposium is made by the Quantum Theory. It had generally been supposed that any of these mathematically possible orbits is also physically possible. The Quantum Theory, however, introduces a principle of selection among the mathematically possible orbits and indeed adopts the following assumption :- " A physical system is only susceptible of a finite number of distinct states ; it jumps from one of these states to another without passing through a continuous series of intermediate states."* This general assumption, if applied to the mathematical theorem we have discussed, will evidently severely delimit the orbits mathematically possible. As a physical principle, it selects from the mathematical possibilities. The original mathematical theorem, since it asserts a mathematical fact, gives a catalogue of the logical possibilities. Viewed from this angle, the parts played by mathematics and physics in this matter are clearly entirely distinct. We recognize that all physical possibilities must necessarily be mathematical possibilities : but it is no part of the mathematician's task, nor does it lie within his power, to offer any criticism of the physical principle. The physicist asserts that h can only take specific values ; the mathematician asserts that if k is fixed, a certain value of h entails as a consequence a certain value of 1. * Poincar6, Dernidres Pense's, p. 185, as quoted by Jeans in his Report on Radiation and the Quantum Theory (1924), p. 25.</page><page sequence="11">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 29 Although it is beyond the scope of mathematics to criticize the assumption, it is interesting to notice the general nature of the assumption. The mathematically possible states form a continuous set ; the physically possible states-according to the assumption-form a discontinuous set. The compact series of states previously assumed to be physically possible now gives place-as has already been explained in the first contribution to this symposium-to a discrete series ; in the terminology of modern logic,* an 7v series is now superseded by an f2 series. The simplest example of a well-ordered series, an f2 series, is the series of natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, .... n, .... ; the simplest example of a compact series, an n series is the series of fractions in order of magnitude, 1 1 3 The nature of well-ordered and compact relations is well under- stood and the relation between them has been fully investigated. Though logically distinct in some of their properties, they are both asymmetrical, transitive and connected, being both of them serial relations ; further, a compact relation may without difficulty be manufactured formally from a well-ordered relation, for example by the process of exponentiation.t The difference of logical structure between the two can be analysed into terms of various abstract properties. Any objection to the assumption of a discrete series of states for a physical system instead of the traditional assumption of a continuous series of states is indeed capable of being put in terms of abstract properties of the relation between different states of a single physical system. And indeed, any objection, if it is to be appraised at its true value, should be so expressed. For this reason, if for no other, it has been worth while to refer * Vide Whitehead and Russell, Principia Mathematica, and alsc Russell, Introduction to Mathematical Logic. t Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 19, 5 (1919), 219-233.</page><page sequence="12">30 DOROTHY WRINCH. to the general characteristics of compact and well-ordered serial relations. And, as so often occurs, in the process of being stated in their most fundamental terms, the cogency of the objections disappears. Physical intuitions as to whether very complicated and obscure relations are discrete or compact are clearly, if I may venture to say so, out of place. We have to assume to be true, whatever fits the facts of experience most adequately. If our assumption is discordant with our feelings in the matter, that is of no importance. Only if it is in disagreement with the facts of physics which have been sifted through masses of observational and experimental results of the most delicate and fundamental types, is any modification required. The dis- continuities of the Quantum Theory are like the paradoxes of the Theory of Relativity. The suggestion that mass varies with velocity is introduced, for example, in order to relate together, as neatly as possible, certain groups of physical facts which have been gleaned from an enormous number of experiments and observations. It is not introduced to fit in with our private unofficial view of the universe, and, in fact, it would be a dismal failure if it had been introduced with this object. Its value as a hypothesis is to be estimated in terms of its power of relating inter se certain well-established physical facts, and it must be judged from this point of view. The situation is precisely the same with regard to the discontinuities of the Quantum Theory. Their justification rests on their usefulness in knitting together the facts of physics. We have taken the view that mathematics and logic can have no criticisms to make of the assumption of a discrete series of states of certain physical systems in the Quantum Theory. Nevertheless, from the point of view of scientific method the present state of the Theory, with its brilliant welter of ad hoc hypotheses, can only be tolerated as an intermediate stage. It is evident that the concepts involved in physics cannot yet be</page><page sequence="13">31 THE QUANTUM THEORY. adequately specified, for, with a complete specification, the selection of an Q of states from the 1 series of states mathematically possible would appear deductively and would not be introduced as a principle ad hoc. A restatement of the whole theory is urgently called for from the point of view of scientific methodology. From this point of view any case where an 7 of possibilities is turned into an i1 of possibilities is of interest. A simple case occurs in the classical theory of the vibration of strings due to Fourier and finally elaborated by the late Lord Rayleigh. If a string of elasticity k and density p vibrates en times a second, the wave-length X of the vibration is ,/ . Just as we had m ,o the relation h2 = #1 for the orbital motions described above, so we have the relation \ 2 m 2-k/p for the vibrations of a string. Now suppose that the conditions of support of the string are given. It may, for instance, be stretched between two points at a distance l apart. Then we easily deduce that en can take only a certain set of values, we have in fact 2rX+/P=1,2,....,.... k Thus the continuous set of values of qn carrying with them corresponding values of X the wave-lengths are now replaced by a discrete set of values. Once again an X series is replaced by an i2 series. The way in which the transition has been accomplished is an every-day occurrence in mathematics. For consider a continuous function f associated with a continuous variable x. Take, for example, the function sin x. The values of this function form a continuous set. But, if we consider the values of x for which Hthis function has a specific value for example, we might</page><page sequence="14">32 DOROTHY WRINCH. consider the values of x for which sin x is zero-we have to deal with a discrete set of values. The zeros of an elementary function in fact form a simple and interesting exemplar of the way in which a continuous set of terms can give rise to a discrete series of terms, in a purely formal manner. Although, therefore, at the present time, it is necessary in expositions of the Quantum Theory to introduce an ad hoc assumption (and indeed to introduce such assumptions by no means infrequently) yet ultimately some fundamental assumption will have to be introduced into the bedrock of physical laws which, translated into mathematical form, will yield naturally and inevitably a consequence of the type expressed in these assumptions. This can only come about satisfactorily by means of some general mathematical mechanism. It is for this reason that it has been deemed worth while to introduce the example of the periods of vibration of a stretched string, for in this case the continuous set of values of an elementary function has in the simplest possible way yielded the discrete set of its zeros. The form of the fundamental postulate which lies behind is not yet known. The atomicity of h the angular momentum may perhaps be derivable from a general structural postulate. There is still the outstanding question of the atomicity of e, the charge carried by an electron. It has already been suggested, on more than one occasion,* that these two atomicities may be special aspects of some principle more general than either of them, but the efforts which have so far been made have not been successful.t Our conclusions may be briefly stated. The discontinuities of the Quantum Theory in themselves cannot be adversely criticized or even discussed by the mathematician. From the * See, for example, Jeans, loc. cit., pp. 78-79. t See, for example, Eddington, Proc. Roy. Soc., A., 1921.</page><page sequence="15">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 33 continuous set of states considered possible by the classical mechanics, a discrete set has been selected as alone being physically possible. Any criticism of this assumption can only come from a consideration of how far such an assumption is valuable in relating inter se facts of the physical universe which have been adequately established by observation and experiment. Any criticisms on the grounds of our intuitive feelings about continuity are out of place and become quite clearly improper and indeed lacking in cogency when they are stated in terms of the logical concept of continuity. Nevertheless, in so far as the assumptions of the Quantum Theory are introduced ad hoc and are not part of the fundamental structure of science, they cannot be considered finally satisfactory. The assumptions of the Theory of Relativity, stated in the analytically convincing invariant form, alone in science at the present day have the touch of finality about them. They alone in their grandeur lie too deep for criticism. Our intuitive ideas of the physical universe are there left behind, and in their abstract beauty, they may not be approached with the rough and ready weapons of every-day life. The Quantum Theory in the tremendous success which it has experienced is pointing the way to a further postulate of the same fundamental character, to another postulate of the same unapproachable severity. C</page><page sequence="16">34 III. By F. A. LINDEMANN. THE idea of quanta was first introduced by Planck nearly twenty years ago in order to account for the distribution of energy in the spectrum of complete radiation. Its triumphs in predicting or explaining successively the velocity of electrons emitted by metals under the influence of light, the atomic heat of solids at low temperatures, the chemical constants of the simpler substances, the spectral series of the lighter elements, the X-ray spectra of all the elements and the various atomic constants have assured it a permanent place in physical thought, and there can be little doubt that it forms the outstanding discovery of our generation. The principle of relativity modified our outlook because it forced us to realize how arbitrary were our thought-co-ordinates and how much our laws depend upon their arbitrary choice. But though the principle of relativity is able to account for the deviations between the phenomena actually observed and those predicted according to the older views, this difference amounts to but one part in a hundred million. Further, it is clear that the older theories by suitable subsidiary hypotheses would be able to explain these small discrepancies, and it is probably generally admitted by now that the principal merit of relativity is its simplicity and elegance. To discuss whether phenomena really occur in a Euclidean or a non-Euclidean space-time manifold is about as useful as to discuss whether the configura- tion of the earth's surface is best represented by Mercator or by some other cartographer.</page><page sequence="17">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 35 The questions raised by the Quantum Theory are of a somewhat more fundamental kind, and though it is clearly impossible that they should be discussed by the man in the street, it is extremely desirable that they should be considered by competent philo- sophers. When it is realized that the theory accounts quanti- tatively for all the numerous phenomena mentioned above, and that the divergence of the quantities observed from those to be expected on the older, so-called classical, theories amounts often to almost 100 per cent., it is remarkable that it has attracted so little general attention outside scientific circles. The physical rules, which are summed up under the heading Quantum Theory, are fairly definite. But they are little more than rules and their inner meaning is as yet obscure. The essential fact appears to be the exceptional state of periodic systems in which the average values over a complete period of a quantity ML2 whose dimensions are -- (M, L and T representing mass, length and time) are integral multiples of a universal constant usually denoted by the symbol h. Whether h is best regarded as an energy multiplied by a time or a momentum multiplied by a length or the square of a momentum multiplied by a time and divided by a mass or any other of the numerous possibilities has often been discussed. The thesis here put forward is, that it should be treated as a fundamental concept, of which our more usual concepts, e.g., energy or momentum are merely forms of representation. If this view is accepted, there seems nothing more startling in the assumption of units or atoms of action or angular momentum than there is in the idea of indivisible units of mass or electric charge. In this connexion it is perhaps desirable to examine a little more closely the foundation of our system of fundamental physical concepts and to call attention to an anomaly which has scarcely obtained the notice it appears to deserve. It is a truism to say c2</page><page sequence="18">36 F. A. LINDEMANN. that our physical world requires for its description three concepts or dimensions, apart, of course, from the somewhat artificial idea of temperature, which is a measure of the probability of certain distributions and does not apply to individual atomic processes. The concepts or units usually chosen are length, mass and time. Now the psychological anomaly referred to and whose explanation may be of more than academic interest is this, that whereas we are all prepared to believe that the physical universe is built up of discontinuous indivisible units of mass (or electric charge) almost everyone reacts violently against the idea that it might be built up also of indivisible units or atoms of length or time. Dis- continuities in mass are a truism: why are discontinuities in length or time treated as revolting and almost indecent ? The reason perhaps may be that these latter conceptions are purely artificial, invented by ourselves, essentially continuous co-ordinates invaluable in describing events. Just as an attack upon his graven image has been resented more hotly by man throughout the ages than an attack upon his living brother, so we perhaps resent an attack upon the continuity of our artificial length and time co-ordinates more than upon, what may be, the more natural mass co-ordinate. If there is anything in this idea, then it may be that the difficulties of the Quantum Theory are due rather to an anthropomorphic insistence upon the use of certain fundamental concepts than to the nature of the pheno- mena. The so-called paradoxes of relativity arise only if one insists upon assuming that the four-dimensional space-time interval can be split up uniquely into space and time. May not the repugnance with which we regard the singularities of the Quantum Theory have its origin in the assumption that it is legitimate to describe phenomena in units of mass, length and time ? If we can once attune our minds to the conception that the fundamental quantities are others, if we can state physical laws in these other units and acquire the habit of thinking in</page><page sequence="19">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 37 terms thereof, it may well be that the discontinuities of the Quantum Theory will appear as natural as the idea of the indivisible discontinuous electric units, the electrons and protons. Though the fundamental dimensions or units we use have the advantage of an ancient lineage and a respectable history, there is no disguising the fact that they have proved their value only in describing purely statistical processes in which vast numbers of particles are involved. For mechanics or electrical engineering it is immaterial whether one uses one set of concepts or another. But it is by no means obvious that the same freedom of choice is desirable when we come to consider the interaction of individual atoms. In this case the mental habit of thinking of mechanical processes in terms of length, mass and time may, and as experiment proves does, involve us in disturbing dis- continuities, which might well appear quite natural if we thought in terms of (say) mass, charge and action. The first two are everyday concepts, familiar to all physicists, whose atomicity is not only accepted without question, but seems almost inevitable. Is it not possible to attain the same desirable mental attitude towards the third ? It is really not a more artificial or arbitrary quantity than (say) force or energy, and its role in the principle of least action has given it a traditional claim upon our regard. Fifty years elapsed before the idea of energy, a bastard conception if ever there was one, had established itself. Nowadays the term has attained such universal acceptance that probably nobody would object to the idea of quanta of energy. Presumably a similar result would follow if one could familiarize oneself equally with the idea of action, or some similar quantity. May not the solution of the quantum difficulties be found in the choice of a system of fundamental physical concepts which may be thought of as atomic without undue repugnance and whose</page><page sequence="20">38 F. A. LINDEMANN. atomic structure will lead naturally to the quantum discon- tinuities ? It is obvious that we shall choose mass M and electrical charge E as two of our fundamental concepts. Their atomic nature is familiar, and rightly or wrongly they seem easy to visualize. The third concept is less obvious, but in view of the role of Planck's unit of action h in modern physics it seems natural to choose action H. E2 has the dimensions ML3 T-2 if we reduce our new fundamental concept to the old M (mass) L (length) T (time) concepts. Action H has the dimensions ML2T-1. If we write these identities in the form E2 2 ML3 T-2 and H ML2 T-1 H2 H3 we see at once that L E2 and T M . ME]2 MEV Thus from our new point of view length and time are derived units so that, e.g., unit length is defined as the length at which unit charge and unit mass rotating would have unit action or moment of angular momentum. Similarly unit force would be the force acting between unit charges and masses rotating with unit action, etc. To say these quantities occur in nature only in discrete multiples of some fundamental natural units need not shock the most sensitive physicist or even philosopher. The statement does not involve any discontinuity in our artificial co-ordinates length and time any more than does, e.g., the fact that the charge and mass of an electron together with the velocity of light define a length. We associate this length with the electron's radius, but we do not say that this involves that lengths have discontinuities. In the same way the fact that m, e and h can yield a length or time merely means that they define the radius and period of electrons rotating on natural orbits, not that length and time are discontinuous. That the assumption of the discrete ultimate constitution of mass, charge and action yields all the well-known results of the Quantum Theory is indubitable. It would equally yield, as a</page><page sequence="21">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 39 special case when one is dealing with large numbers of these ultimate particles, the laws of the classical mechanics and electro- dynamics. The conflict, if any, arises, from an attempt to apply laws obtained from, and only valid for, statistical averages to individual phenomena. Similar difficulties appear if one endeavours to apply the old laws in which electricity was regarded as composed of continuous fluids to phenomena involving single electrons. The real difficulty lies in attaining the habit of regarding mass, charge and action as fundamental units. Unless a physicist thinks in terms of electrons his usefulness is very small. Probably in future it will appear that he must think also in terms of atoms of action. He may not think of an inverse square law of force but of a series of orbits whose axes increase as the squares of the natural numbers. A quasi-elastic restoring force may be repre- sented to his mind by a succession of orbits with axes varying as the square roots of the integers. Or perhaps instead of thus substituting a relation between mass, charge and action and length for our present relation between mass, length and time and force, he may choose other terms and find other concepts. In any event it seems likely that some reconsideration of the convention that mass, length and time are the fundamental concepts is called for, and progress may well require that they be replaced. If, as the above seems to show, a system can be found which leads naturally to the results of the Quantum Theory, there seems every reason for the physicist to adopt it. Should this point of view be right the Quantum Theory involves nothing mysterious or even startling. But it does seem to lead us to doubt the view usually taken that all systems of fundamental physical concepts are equally valid. The set mass, length and time lead to difficulties, the set mass, charge and action do not. Whether other sets may yield the same result seems doubtful;</page><page sequence="22">40 F. A. LINDEMANN. but the set mass, charge and action seem to be distinguished clearly in nature by the discrete atomic structure of the ultimate parts. Variations of any one of these quantities can obviously only take place per saltum and their values can only bear whole number relation to one another. To endeavour to reconcile this fact with the classical mechanics is meaningless. As well might one think it necessary to reconcile the occurrence of electrons and protons with the classical electro-dynamics. The apparent conflict is really psychological, induced by the fact that we describe events and phenomena in the unnatural terms of length, mass and time, instead of in the natural terms of mass, charge and action. If we could accustom ourselves to these latter and think in terms of them, there seems little doubt that the apparent difficulties of the Quantum Theory would disappear and the so-called discontinuities would seem as natural to us as does at present the atomic constitution of matter. The solution of the quantum problem suggested here is in some ways but a logical sequel to the first step in the emancipation of the mind from convention represented by the principle of relativity. Space and time, though reduced to sections of a four-dimensional manifold, were left all their old reality and validity as fundamental concepts. The quantum phenomena, urge us to withhold even this last tribute to their former universal dominion. But although this releases us from the age-long fetters of length and time as the proper forms of representation of physical phenomena and forces us to realize the arbitrariness of the con- vention which imposed these abstractions on our mental pro- cesses, our freedom is short-lived, for the quantum phenomena in their turn seem to indicate clearly that certain concepts have a singular position in nature and that physical processes can be described more simply in one set of terms than in any others. All our terms, mass, length, time, charge, actions, force, etc., are but different aspects of reality. Modern physics tells us that only</page><page sequence="23">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 41 integral multiples of certain ultimate units of mass, charge and action occur in nature. Any other set of concepts leads to incommensurable relations. It seems reasonable therefore to ascribe to this particular set of concepts or aspects a special significance, and to describe natural events rather in terms of the linkage of units of masses, charges and actions rather than in the conventional aspects of masses, lengths and times.</page><page sequence="24">42 IV. By H. WILDON CARR. BEFORE it is possible to indicate the philosophical problem which is raised by the Quantum Theory, it is necessary to understand quite unambiguously what that theory affirms in physics. The easiest way to understand this is to refer to some familiar concepts in the history of philosophy, and particularly to concepts which arose before philosophy took a divergent direction from that of positive science. Descartes conceived movement as an externally imparted activity, imposed from without on matter or extension, constant in quantity and indestructible. Leibniz, criticizing this concept, replaced it with the concept of force, that is, an essentially internal originating activity. Modern physics has replaced both these concepts, movement and force, with the concept of energy. Of this energy movement is the kinetic form, force the latent. Contemporary experimental research in physics has enabled us to trace to its ultimate source the energy of the physical universe. We are as far as ever from understanding its metaphysical nature or its metaphysical origin, but we have discovered its ultimate home so far as physics is concerned. Energy has been traced to its origin in atomic oscillations. It is emitted and propagated in undulations whenever the electron of an atom is disturbed in its orbital revolution, that is, when it changes from one orbit to another. If we take what we believe to be the simplest atom, the hydrogen atom with a single electric charge on its nucleus and a single negative electron, we find that the orbit of this electron is not fixed or permanent, under certain conditions or influences the electron will change from one orbit to another. The fact on which the Quantum Theory is based is</page><page sequence="25">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 43 the strange and inexplicable discovery (inexplicable on the classical theory) that these orbits are not a compact series, they are not infinite in the mathematical definition, they are a definite num- ber: physicists tell us there are about thirty. The energy is only emitted in discrete quanta and not continuously. We may put it in another way. The observational fact is not the atom itself, but its spectrum. The spectrum of hydrogen is a definite number of lines and not a continuous band. The spectrum is a statistical fact, a mass effect. If, therefore, the atoms producing this mass effect were material systems obeying the law of the inverse square, the emission of energy would be continuous, there would be an infinite number of orbits presenting an undivided spectrum. But why, we may ask, do physicists want a Quantum Theory ? It is the peculiarity of facts that they impose themselves on us and are indifferent to our a priori constructions or anticipa- tions. It may seem then that in this case we have simply to accept the facts and that this is the end of the matter. We may speculate. We may suppose that the strangeness of the discovery is due to some defect in our power of observation or to some limit in its extension. We may even hope that a super-spectroscope will one day bridge the gap which is disconcerting us. It is not so. There is a quite peculiar necessity behind the demand for a Quantum Theory. The reason we must have a theory is that in the science of electro-magnetism the facts are not simple obser- vations such as we conduct on the plane of our ordinary experi- ence, they are interpretations which wholly depend upon a principle. It is with the classical principle in electro-magnetism that the new fact comes into contradiction. What, then, is the classical principle ? It is the principle which seems to govern the movements of the universe of our ordinary perception, and it is expressed in Newton's laws of motion. Just as Newton conceived the idea that one formula would serve for the fall of an apple and for the revolution of a planet, so we conceive that</page><page sequence="26">44 H. WILDON CARR. the principle which governs our ordinary observations of sense experience holds good for the infinitely little and the infinitely great. All these celestial and terrestrial movements are inter- preted by us as continuous. We suppose, for example, that the moon's velocity of revolution is being continuously retarded by the action of the tides it occasions, that its orbit is therefore continuously changing, and that the two masses are coming closer and closer together. We cannot be said to observe this, it is simply a direct application of the principle of the inverse square to our observation. It is, in fact, the meaning of the Newtonian gravitation formula. I have taken the problem of the spectral lines merely to illustrate the difficulty. It is neither the original nor the most striking of the observational facts which contradict the classical theory. I choose it because it seems to me simpler to understand and easier to explain than black-body radiation and the other phenomena which originally led to the formulation of the Quantum Theory. The philosophical problem with which we are presented closely resembles the famous Greek problem of Achilles and the tortoise. In fact, the analogy is perfect. To ordinary observation Achilles moving by steps (quanta) overtakes the tortoise, yet theoretically each step requires as its a priori condition that it should exhaust an infinite series of stages, and therefore overtaking the tortoise is an impossibility. It is a significant fact that this very quantum problem appeared in psychology at the first attempt in the last century to bring psychological phenomena within the scheme of physical and mathematical causation. The Weber-Fechner law attempted to equate changes in quantitative physical stimulation with changes in qualitative sensation. It devised a formula, but the formula proved too limited in its application to be of any theor- etical value. There is a sense, for example, in which it is true</page><page sequence="27">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 45 that it is the last straw which breaks the camel's back, and yet there are no imaginable conditions under which the suffering animal can be held to appreciate the addition or substraction of a straw from its load. We find indeed that throughout the whole realm of sensible experience all the qualities of things are mass effects and are selected according to some principle. Take the colour scale, for example. Mathematically we schematize it as a continuous difference of frequency of light waves, but sensed colour is a selection of frequencies widely separated from one another. Colours are massed groups giving an average statistical resultant, but as distinct and as discrete as the lines in the spectrum. The usual explanation is well illustrated in the psychological theory of the specious present. Theoretically the actual present is a mathematical point without duration which divides the past from the future. Actually it is a quantum of duration. We generally interpret it by assuming that the physical reality geo- metrically conceived as space and time is mathematically deter- mined and divisible to infinity, but that the mind has a subjective hold over the flux, in memory and imagination, and is thereby able to hold the real moment in an illusive subjective reinstate- ment of the non-existent past and future. There is nothing, then, in the least extraordinary in the mere concept of quanta. It enters of necessity into the interpretation of all psychical phenomena, of all the data of sensible experience. What is extraordinary and unaccountable and revolutionary is to find ourselves obliged to introduce it into physics. There it appears peculiarly out of place and even self-contradictory. It is rational to conceive a minimum sensibile. It is irrational to apply the principle of a minimum sensibile to what is by definition insensible, and, as simple fact, far beneath the threshold of discriminating consciousness. Hitherto we have always assumed that scientific reality, the other of thought, must conform to the</page><page sequence="28">46 H. WILDON CARR. necessities of thought when we think mathematically, and quan- titative continuity is one of the mathematical postulates. The minima sensibilia offer a limit to the sensible apprehension of reality, but offer no limit to the intelligible nature of reality. I now come to the distinctively philosophical problem. With the theoretical physical problem, how we are to construct con- ceptually the atomic system consistently with the phenomena observed by the spectroscope, I am not concerned. The physicist is inquiring what law is to replace the Newtonian gravitation formula. Whatever it is it must apply universally and it must also account for the successful working of the law of the inverse square at the plane of observation represented by ordinary human experience. But behind this physical problem there is an essentially metaphysical one. I will try to state it. What is the true relation between the concept of a physical reality com- pletely amenable to mathematical quantitative methods, and the concept of a physical reality essentially qualitative and indifferent to measurement ? It takes us to the heart of the scientific problem. Which is primordial, the sensed experience or the scientific object ? Leibniz tells us that when he first studied the metaphysical problem of the ultimate constitution of the reality of the physical universe he was strongly attracted to the Democritean concept of atoms and void. We know that he came to discover the atomic theory unworkable and self-contradictory and he rejected it decisively, but it never lost its influence over him. It led him to set to work to think out what are the real atoms of nature. The simple substances which alone can be conceived as essentially indivisible are active forces. These he named monads. But with his new concept of the monad or simple indivisible activity he introduced also a new concept of the continuity of the universe. Instead of a containing space and time, the Newtonian postulates, he conceived a living universe, every constituent of which was</page><page sequence="29">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 47 distinguished by the nature and range of its activity alone. What does nothing is nothing and what a thing does that the thing is. The principle of relativity seems to me in what is essential in it to be a scientific formulation of this concept of reality. There are differences due to the different line of approach, but the fundamental thought is the same. For example, the activity of the monads according to Leibniz consists in perception alone; the activity of observers of nature, according to Einstein, consists in mathematical co-ordination from the standpoint of a system of reference experienced at rest in relation to systems conceived to be moving. In each case it is quite clear that the principle of continuity is not to be looked for in an objective container but in an active co-ordinator. Let us now turn to the question set for our symposium. There are three clearly distinguishable concepts of continuity. The continuity which psychology is concerned with is purely a continuity of function to which structure is altogether sub- servient. It takes the form of personal or individual identity and is the continuity of living experience. With this continuity the Quantum Theory is not concerned directly, and it only becomes relevant by way of analogy. The analogy may indeed prove to be significant, but the scientific inquirer can regard psychological continuity as a subjective identity, and can abstract the psychical function entirely from its material content. It can appear without any necessary relation to a physical and mathematical continuum. The mathematical and physical concepts are in a different category. The mathematical conception of continuity combines in its definition two predicates which, taken abstractly, are directly contradictory-discreteness and compactness. The continuity of space is defined mathematically as an infinite series of points or positions, and therefore as absolutely discrete, and the infinity</page><page sequence="30">48 H. WILDON CARR. of the series is defined by the negation of contact. No member is next another and between any two points there is another. So also with the continuity of time the instants are points and the process succession, and the compactness of a period consists in no two instants being next one another so as to exclude an interven- ing instant. What the Quantum Theory shows is that when space and time or whatever is conceived as occupying space and time are treated objectively and conceived mathematically, they cannot serve as the basis of the continuity which physics requires. More than this, the mathematical concept directly conflicts with the experimental results. This does not imply that the mathe- matical concept of continuity is to be rejected as false or aban- doned as useless, or that it has been found wanting as an adequate analysis of space and time, the formal elements of experience. Quite otherwise. What it shows is that the continuity of physical reality is of an entirely different order to mathematical con- tinuity and analogous to psychological. Physical reality consists of quanta which are constants and indivisible. Such quanta are in mathematics a self-contradiction. Let us not call in question the truth or utility of mathematical concepts, for our present inquiry there is no reason why we should, but let us try to suggest the reason why in the Quantum Theory mathematical concepts fail. I will offer my suggestion. It is a necessary consequence of the discovery of the energetical nature of physical reality, of the discovery that its constitution is ultimately dynamical and not material, not inert and not statical. In so far as the physical reality of the universe involves the notion of action, of becoming, of enduring, of changing-that is, of concepts into which time-process enters as a fundamental condition, concepts for which, as Kant showed, time is a schema-continuity must postulate indivisible quanta. And further, if the fundamental reality of nature is action, then the continuity of nature must be conceived as process, and</page><page sequence="31">THE QUANTUM THEORY. 49 it follows by a clear logical necessity that a time schematization is more original than the spatial terms into which action may be analysable, or than the states in which alone it is representable. The mathematical definition of continuity as the infinity of a compact series is only applicable to a static condition, and static conditions are derived not original, it is meaningless and even self-contradictory when affirmed of the concrete process itself. The Quantum Theory is a necessary consequence of the dis- covery that the basis of physical reality is not matter but energy. D</page></plain_text>
