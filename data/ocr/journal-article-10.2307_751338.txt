It will be argued in this paper that its focus is the Sun ofjustice. * This paper is based on the fourth chapter of my Ph.D thesis Sol Verus.

His face, with dark moustache and pointed beard, dark hair swept back, is depicted against a golden cross. Christ is giving the Greek blessing with his right arm bent at the elbow, and right hand raised to his breast, while his left hand, with arm slightly bent and lowered, holds the hem of his garment. The mandorla consists of three concentric blue ovals shading to a lighter blue at the edge. From the figure of Christ emanate seven or eight symmetrical silver rays which extend beyond the mandorla. The five accompanying figures are identified by inscriptions above their heads. To the right and left of Christ stand Elijah and Moses, Elijah wearing a tunic and fur coat, Moses a tunic and pallium. They are both depicted as old with beards and grey hair, and both raise their right hand in a gesture of speech. The three Disciples beneath the mandorla express astonishment: they have fallen to their knees and are trying to direct their gaze towards the vision without quite succeeding. Each witness to the vision is lit by one of the rays which changes the colour of his clothing in the area of its impact. Apart from a narrow band of green under the feet of Moses, Elijah and the Disciples, the background of the composition is evenly golden. It is strictly symmetrical and as such a typical piece of apsidal decoration. The dynamism of the scene is a striking portrayal of the atmosphere of wonder on Mount Tabor. Below the scene is the following dedicatory inscription: t 'Ev 6v6Ctatit prO Cpbg Kai 6to6 Kai dyiot) -vEjFZTog. y7ovEV Vb xTO&amp;V ?pyov o hp Too r9 (Yrlpi(g TOv Sap?noAoprladvov,itni Aoyyivou zof 6madt&amp;to, Orpeop3UTpo Kai rl you~ vou t t o ouG Sti OGoopoO speopu[epo t Kai Ke5 :Tpapiou, iv~St1t0vog &amp;t t.4 The apse is framed with thirty-one medallion busts of figures identified by inscriptions. In the lower margin are the figures of David, all the major and minor prophets, the hegoumenos Longinus and John the Deacon,5 and in the upper the remaining Apostles and Evangelists. Above the head of Christ, between the images of Andrew and Paul, one more medallion bears a golden Greek cross against a background of three concentric blue spheres which darken towards the centre. The triumphal arch has a medallion with the Lamb of God (P1. 2a) in three-quarter view, set against a Greek cross, and on either side is a winged angel bearing a sceptre and cross-orb. Medallion busts of the Virgin and John the Baptist below the angels complete the composition. The area above the arch contains two Sinai scenes: the Burning Bush and Moses receiving the Law. The strictly symmetrical composition of the apse and triumphal arch has a vertical axis formed by David, Christ, the Greek cross and the Lamb of God. 4 'In the Name of (God) the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. This entire work was executed for the salvation of the donor(s) in the days of Longinus, the most holy presbyter and hegoumenos, by the effort of Theodore, priest and second-in-command, indiction fourteen.' The inscription is analysed by Sevienko (as in n. 2), pp. 255ff, esp. pp. 259-61; Sevienko in Forsyth &amp; Weitzmann (as in n. 1), pp. 19-20; see also A. Guillou, 'Le Monastire de la Theotokos au Sinai', Mdlanges d'archdologie et d'histoire, lxvii, 1955, pp. 217ff, who thinks that the lower part of the inscription with the name of Theodoros is modern and that it dates from 1840-1841, a theory rejected by Sevienko. 5 For information about this character, sometimes erroneously identified with John Climacus, see Weitz- mann (as in n. 2), p. 403.</page><page sequence="3">44 JERZY MIZIOLEK Interesting observations have been made on the iconography and meaning of the Sinai mosaics by various scholars,6 above all Kurt Weitzmann, in what is so far the most comprehensive interpretation.7 According to Weitzmann, six 'layers' of meaning can be discerned; however, he has almost completely neglected the problem of the light which, in the form of wide and distinctly drawn rays, emanates from the figure of Christ. Though never a subject of detailed study, the problem has been raised by a number of authors, some of whom argue that the rays of the Transfiguration symbolise the theophany and reveal God's glory as well as the divine nature of Christ, presenting him as Kyrios elevated by God the Father.8 Although another scholar has recently emphasised the relation between light and the dogma of the Holy Trinity,9 all these observations, however correct, remain fragmentary. The purpose of this article is to offer a more comprehensive interpret- ation. An important element in the problem of the Sinai Transfiguration is the number of the rays. Some art historians observe only seven,'0 but others are of the opinion that there may be eight."11 Part of the mosaic above Christ's head is missing. A hook was at some point driven into the wall to hang a lamp, but in time it rusted and partly destroyed the nimbus and the mandorla. On the edge of the area of loss there is most probably a remnant of an eighth ray emerging vertically behind Christ's head or nimbus. The outermost oval of the mandorla has a zone of lighter blue and there appears to be a break in the double outline of gold around the mandorla at that place. The small fragment of background above this seems to be a mixture of silver and gold tesserae like the other seven rays emanating from Christ. 12 The Sinai mosaics are the earliest known example of a Transfiguration with rays.'" Neither the rays nor the mandorla appear in two earlier representations of 6 See for instance A. Grabar, Martyrium.

Moreover there are numerous later examples of the Transfiguration scene with eight symmetrically arranged rays, dating from the eleventh, twelfth and following centuries: for instance, the mosaic in one of the squinches of the church at Daphni near Athens,20 a panel on the bronze door of San Paolo fuori le mura in Rome (P1. 4a),21 and a miniature in the Psalter of Queen Melisende.22 An interesting example may also be found in the Sinai monastery itself--a beautiful small icon probably dating from the second half of the eleventh century (P1. 4b).23 A number of other Transfiguration scenes with five, 416-421 (with bibliography); Weber (as in n. 11), pp. 47-92; Dufrenne (as in n. 6), pp. 185-206.

It is also worth noting representations with the motif of imago Christi set against two overlapping rectangles which form an eight-pointed star, e.g. a miniature from the theological works of the Emperor John VI Cantacuzene, in the Bibliothbque Nationale, MS gr. 1242, fol. 92v from the 14th century, but probably based</page><page sequence="5">46 JERZY MIZIOLEK six, ten and up to as many as twenty-four or more rays are extant."24 There are also numerous examples with seven symmetrically arranged rays."25 To sum up, it seems not unreasonable to assume, on the basis of the comparative material, and of what remains above the mandorla, that originally eight rays emanated from the Sinai Christ. What are the iconographic antecedents of the Sinai Transfiguration? It has been suggested that representations of the rising sun popular in antique art may have served as models.26 This is not fully convincing, for examples of Helios as a solar charioteer differ considerably from the Sinai scene. There is a similarity between the wide rays in the Transfiguration and the beams radiated by the Phoenix in the Antioch mosaic and by the personification of the sun in a miniature in the Vatican Vergil, both of which date from the fifth century."27 Some valuable general obser- vations concerning the symbolism of rays in the Capella Palatina Transfiguration in Palermo, and their relation to the christogram seen as a solar sign, have been made; but they do not explain the problem though they point to interesting possibilities. 28 The suggestion of solar ancestry may be examined in a modified form: the Sinai rays derive from representations of the sun as a circle with eight rays or as an eight- pointed star-representations which date back as far as the art of the Ancient East. One of the earliest examples is an Old Babylonian relief, now in the Louvre, which depicts the sun as a disk with eight pointed rays.29 A slightly different sun motif, common in the Ancient East, occurs on a Neo-Hittite stele from Northern Syria, now in Berlin.s30Here it is a rosette within a winged disk, and the eight rays have the form of petals. There were also many representations of the sun radiating eight beams from its central circle, and it seems that similar motifs have been found on objects dating from prehistoric times made in Northern Europe. l on a 10th-century prototype; see J.

Good examples are a decadrachm obverse dating from around 500 BC (P1. 3d),32 and a vase from the fourth or third century BC found at Amissus (P1. 3e). The coin shows the sun as a circle with eight rays above a two-wheeled cart, whereas the vase depicts the sun as a star placed between two smaller stars (Dioscuri), over the head of Alexander the Great-the new sun. Similar stars were used to decorate the diadems of the priests of Helios in Egypt.34 They also appear on Roman coins; suffice it to mention those of Constantine the Great, in both the Eastern and the Western parts of the Empire. Eight-pointed stars were placed above representations of triumphal arches and gates and have been related to the concept of Sol Dominus Imperii Romani.35 The sun as a circle with rays very often appears on contorniates.36 An example in the Vatican shows the head in profile of Alexander the Great as Hercules (P1. 3c). v At the tip of Alexander's chin is a circle, with eight 'T' shaped rays emanating from it, which can be taken to represent the sun. The letter 'S' inscribed in the circle stands for Salus or Sol. In this instance the sun motif is used to symbolise prosperity brought by the rising sun. "38 The sun as a circle with eight rays (or 'bunches' of rays), or as an eight-pointed star, is also a common motif in Christian art. Good examples can be found in three tenth-century manuscripts: the Joshua Roll, which is based on an early Christian archetype (P1. 5a),"9 the Gerona Beatus,40 and the Florence Cosmas (P1. 4c).41 In the Joshua Roll the sun, depicted as a circle with eight linear rays, is placed amid the battle between Joshua's army and the Amorites. It also occurs as a circle, this time with triple 'bunches' of rays and the inscription "HXvo;, in the Florence Cosmas. In the miniature from the Beatus manuscript the sun appears in a symbolic context; the eight-pointed star is linked with a figure of the Woman of the Apocalypse.42 The de symboles solaires dans l'art du moyen ige', Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 6th ser., xvii, 1937, pp. 75-82. 32 T.

The image of Helios in the Sacra Parallela (P1. 5d) occurs in a scene depicting the sickness of Hezekiah. A youthful face in a clipeus with eight symmetrically positioned 'bunches' of rays, one set of which falls on a sundial, is shown above the prophet in conversation with the ailing monarch. Even more significant in the context of the Sinai Transfiguration is the imago Solis from the Smyrna Physiologus (P1. 5b). A bust of a young man, not a woman as has been suggested, is depicted in a clipeus above a Phoenix burning on a column. He holds an orb in his left hand, while the open palm of his right hand is raised to head level.45 The eight triple 'bunches' of rays seem to proceed not so much from the edge of the clipeus as from the solar figure itself. Though drawn rather perfunctorily, they appear to emanate from one point and form a kind of star. This image appears to be a faithful imitation of representations of the deity of light of the Sol Invictus type, common in late antique art, rather than an original creation by the eleventh-century illuminator of the codex.46 There is undoubtedly a close affinity between this image and the Sinai Christ except that the Physiologus illustration is only a bust, not a full- length portrayal. It is fair to add that representations of the sun as a circle surrounded by seven rays or a seven-pointed star occur nearly as frequently as the eight-pointed star and the circle with eight rays. 47 The preceding discussion by no means exhausts our examination of the icon- ographic antecedents of the Sinai mosaics because the examples given refer only to the figure of Christ and the rays, not to the whole scene in the apse. Let us return to the suggestion that representations of the theophany in Christian art were modelled on images of the rising sun.48 It is a fruitful idea that can perhaps be taken further. Consider the scene on a red-figure vase from central Italy, now in Parma, dated c. 400 BC (Pls 3a, b).49 This is perhaps too remote to be a direct source of influence, but it provides a striking analogy.

Six naked satyrs, their eyes fixed on Helios's face, witness the event. Their admiration, or astonishment at what they see, is conveyed by their poses, gestures and expressions-they are all wide-eyed and open-mouthed. Various elements which appear in the Sinai Transfiguration are present in this scene, which is itself unique in the history of ancient art. The similarity is apparent in the almost symmetrical layout of the composition, in the central figure emitting rays, in the poses and gestures of the witnesses, in their positioning and in the atmosphere created by the miracle. The representations of the sun as a circle with emanating rays or as a star, together with the scene on the Parma vase, constitute a body of comparative material sufficient to conclude that there is a close correlation between the Sinai Transfiguration and the iconography of the sun.50 What then is the function of the solar element in all this? The Transfiguration figures in all three synoptic Gospels. Luke (ix, 29-30) says: 'And as he (Christ) prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias' Mark (ix, 3): 'And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.' The most important of the three for our purposes is Matthew (xvii, 2): 'And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.' Nevertheless, even an eloquent comparison of Christ with the sun is not the same as actually calling him the sun. These Gospel passages were commented on repeatedly by Christian writers from the third century onwards, with the sun analogy receiving extended treatment."' Origen in his Commentary on Matthew says: And when he is transfigured his face shines like the sun so that he may be revealed to the children of light who have put off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light and are no longer children of darkness or night, but have become the sons of day and walk describes the scene as follows: 'The subject must surely go back to an Attic satyr-play ...

Being revealed to them he will shine on them not only as the sun, but one seen to be the Sun of righteousness (xii, 37).52 In his sermon on the Transfiguration, Ephraem Syrus writes about two suns which were seen by the three Disciples on Mount Tabor-the natural sun and the face of Christ; the light radiating from Christ's face, brighter than the light of the natural sun, revealed the magnificence of the divinity of the Transfigured Son of Man.53 Whereas Moses's face at Sinai shone with the reflected glory of the Lord, Christ's glory on Tabor was that of his own divinity. Similar words occur in a fifth-century anonymous Latin writer, Pseudo-Leo: Today in his Transfiguration, he (Christ) wished to make a unified harmony of both Scriptures ... Today the Disciples were able to see two suns upon the mountain; the first was in the firmament and can be seen by all men, but the other shines more splendidly than this and is seen only by the prophets and Disciples: the face ofJesus. This Sun flashes on the mountain and by its power lights up that other which is in the firmament. This is the Sun of justice which shines and blazes: in its blazing it enkindles the faithful, and in its shining it illumines all men. Of this Sun John says: 'That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.'54 St Ambrose refers to the Transfigured Christ both as the eternal Sun of righteous- ness and as the divine Sun,55 while St Augustine says: 'He is the Sun foretold by the prophets.'56 The recently discovered Sermon for the Feast of the Transfiguration by Anastasius of Sinai postdates the Sinai mosaics by a century. None the less, it is a particularly significant document for their iconography. Anastasius spent many years at the monastery and around 680 was its hegoumenos.57 In the sermon he refers to Christ as both the Sun and the Sun of righteousness, the Sun that 'casts down' rays.58 Moreover Anastasius, obviously inspired by II Corinthians iii, 7-18, 52 Transl. in McGuckin (as in n. 51), p. 157.

On the one hand they underline the divine nature of Christ, and on the other they contrast the true Light that emanates from Christ with the light of the sun 'qui adoratur a paganis et Manichaeis'.6o If it is borne in mind that the divinity of Christ is given effect on Mount Tabor by way of an exegesis of the Old Testament event on Mount Sinai, the 'solarity' of Christ becomes significant in terms both of demonstratio and of praeparatio evangelica: what Moses had veiled, and what the pagans had been deflected from by worshipping the natural sun, stands revealed in the glory of the Transfiguration.61 But are the rays in the Sinai Transfiguration sufficient grounds for interpreting the portrayal of Christ as the spiritual Sun of righteousness? To answer this question let us make the following comparison. An identical motif of rays appears in scenes depicting the Harrowing of Hell.62 The earliest known example, in which the rays are symmetrically arranged as in the Sinai Transfiguration, is the mosaic chapel of S. Zeno at S. Prassede in Rome dating from the first quarter of the ninth century 59 For Anastasius's texts, see Guillou (as in n. 4), pp. 237f, 240f, 247f.

Cor.: PL, xxx, cols 778-80. 60 These words occur in St Augustine's Enarratio in Ps. xxv, 3: CCSL, xxxviii, p. 143. As is well known, the pagan cult of the Sun reached its peak in the 3rd century and at the beginning of the 4th, but even in St Augustine's and Leo the Great's day there seemed to be a fairly large number of sun-worshippers, as the repeated warn- ings against them testify; for Augustine e.g. Sermo cxc, vii, 1 (PL, xxxviii, col. 1007) and Enarrationes in Psalmos x, 3; lxxx, 14; xciii, 4; ciii, 19-23; cxlii, 3; cxlviii, 16; cf. also xcvi, 18 (CCSL, xxxviii-xl). Cf. also Theodoret of Cyrus, Hellenikon therapeutike pathematon, iii, 6-13 (Theodoret de Cyr, Therapeutique des maladies hellniques, ed. P. Canivet, Paris 1958, pp. 172ff). For Leo the Great see e.g. his famous Sermo xxvii, CCSL, cxxxviii, p. 135. Traces of this cult may have survived into the sixth century. Caesarius of Arles, following strictly Augustine's Enarr in Ps. xxv, 3, writes: 'Eice illam de corde, antequam occidat lux ista visibilis, ne te deserat lux illa invisibilis. Sed et aliter melius intellegitur, quia noster sol iustitiae et veritatis Christus: non iste sol qui adoratur a paganis et Manichaeis, et videtur etiam a peccatoribus, sed ille alius cuius veritate anima humana inlustratur, ad quem gaudent angeli' (Sermo, clxxx, 2: CCSL, civ, p. 731).

A well-preserved example of a scene showing eight rays can be found in the mid-eleventh-century rock church of St Barbara in Soganle in Cappadocia (P1. 5c).64 TWO texts may be cited: Melito of Sardis calling Christ 'King of Heavens and creation's Captain, the Sun of the rising who appeared both to the dead in Hades and to mortals in the world';65 and Pseudo-Epiphanius referring to him as 'the great Samson, God the Sun who shone in Limbo.'66 A Resurrection portrayal may also involve solar elements. A miniature in the Rabbula Gospels shows the Holy Sepulchre as a small chapel with columns, from whose half-open door emanate three rays which strike down the guards (P1. 8a)-a synecdoche for the rising sun and the risen Christ.67 If the Transfiguration 'fulfils' the theophany on Mount Sinai, it anticipates the Parousia at the end of time.68 Like the Transfiguration, the Parousia is a phenom- enon of supernatural light or glory.69 In the Sinai mosaic the reference to the future event is carried by the luminous cross in the axis between Christ and the Lamb. According to the Gospels and the Fathers of the Church, a shining cross will precede Christ at the Second Coming.70 In his Commentary on Luke (xi, 28) Eusebius 63 B.

And it will not be up a high mountain but to heaven itself that he will lead the worthy by his godhead.71 The eschatological aspect of the Transfiguration seems to be confirmed by the presence of the prophets and perhaps also David in the apse mosaic. In the Acts of the Apostles (iii, 19-24), it seems to be suggested that all the prophets foretold the Second Coming. According to Origen,72 St Basil the Great73 and St Augustine,74 the Second Coming is also foretold in the Psalms. Some of these prophecies, and comments on them, may have been used as literary sources for the Sinai mosaics. There is also the much interpreted passage in Malachi (iv, 2-5), which brings together Horeb-Sinai, Moses and Elijah, the Sun of righteousness and the 'fulfilment of the age';'75 and Isaiah (lx, 19-20): ... The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light. And thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down ... for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. In his commentary on this text St Jerome establishes a relationship between the brightness of the light of the Lord and Malachi's Sun of righteousness: 76 Et hoc capitulo cogimur omnia quae dicta sunt et dicenda, ad ultimum referre tempus ... Et erit Dominus ipse lumen perpetuum, ut quae Xthaomzia carnaliter asserunt esse complenda, nos spiritaliter futura credamus, in qualitate promissionum, non in tempore discrepantes. Quibus breviter respondendum est, quod pseudo-prophetis et peccatoribus sol occidit meridie, et e contrario timentibus Dominum oritur sol iustitiae.77 The Sinai representation of Christ may be compared with images of Christ at the Second Coming in the Roman churches of S. Paolo fuori le mura (P1. 6a) and SS. Cosma e Damiano (P1. 6b), where the solar meaning is well established. On the wall of the triumphal arch in S. Paolo, Christus-Helios in a clipeus, from which issue the Trinity, alludes to the divine nature of Christ'. This cross could also allude to the Passion; for this problem see Deichmann (as in n. 68), Kommentar, ii, pp. 246ff. 71 Transl. in McGuckin (as in n. 51), p. 166. For Greek text: PG, xxiv, col. 549.

Cosma e Damiano a full length figure of Christ- Oriens clothed in a golden garment appears among the apostles and saints, erect on clouds brightened by the dawn, his right hand raised with open palm.79 Although these representations of Christ use different iconographic formulae, they are all based on the premise that Christ is the spiritual Sun. Of particular relevance is the image in SS. Cosma e Damiano, because it was executed in the reign of Justinian. Two further examples may be cited: the mosaic in the apse of Hosios David in Thessalonica (P1. 6c) so and the illustration to Psalms xlix/1 in the Chludov Psalter (P1. 8c) probably based on an early Christian model.81 The Hosios David mosaic shows a young Christ within a round mandorla, seated on the arc of a rainbow with his right hand raised and his left holding an open scroll inscribed with a paraphrase of Isaiah (xxv, 9). The figure of Christ is set against a shining disc emitting alternately wider and narrower rays of light. From behind the mandorla emerge the symbols of the Evangelists. It is the hill beneath, with the four rivers of Paradise flowing from it, that is the relevant element in the composition. The theophany is witnessed by two prophets, one on each side of Christ. Some scholars believe them to be Habakkuk and Ezekiel, whereas others suggest Isaiah or Ezekiel and St John the Evangelist.82 It is probably right to sup- pose that it is a 'synthetic' representation, combining the Old Testament with 78 For solar symbolism of the representation of Christ on the triumphal arch in S. Paolo fuori le mura, see J. Bolten, Die imago clipeata, Paderborn 1937, p. 49; H.

Yves Christe is of the opinion that the representations of Christ adored by Four and Twenty Elders cannot be con- sidered as the Secundus Adventus but as '... une image de la gloire de Dieu et de l'Eglise dans son palais-temple celeste ... apres la mort et la Resurrection, acte d'inves- titure qui etablit un regne nouveau et fonde par la mime occasion le Regne du Christ et de l'Eglise'; see Y.

It seems that the representations in S. Paolo fuori le mura have to be considered as an image of the 'synthetic' character, based on different texts, both from Revelation and the Gospels. See J.

And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.'85 In the Chludov Psalter (P1. 8c) it is the prophet Habakkuk who witnesses the theophany. He is seen together with David, paying homage to the clipeus which bears the bust of a bearded Christ. The group is framed, above and below, by the rising and setting sun shown respectively as a youth driving a quadriga, and as a head, encircled with rays, disappearing behind a hill. It has been argued persuasively that some portrayals of Christ in a clipeus in Byzantine psalters represent Christus-Helios.86 The miniature in the Chludov Psalter is a case in point; but does it represent the First or the Second Coming? The verses of Psalms xlix/1 (1-3) which the miniature illustrates offer no pointers, but patristic commentaries suggest the latter, for instance John Chrysostom: .. Matthew makes clear how manifestly Christ's second coming will proclaim itself. For it needs no-one to herald it. His coming by and of itself will proclaim itself. David also pointed this out when he said: 'God in full manifestation will come'.87 It has been contended that the Lamb of God which appears on the triumphal arch in Sinai represents the Lamb of the Apocalypse.88 This seems very likely as two contemporary representations of the Transfiguration, in the Chiesa del Salvatore (Stefania) in Naples,89 and in the Euphrasian basilica in Pored (Parenzo),9? include references to the Apocalypse; the former is known to have represented the Elders doing homage to the figure on the throne (Revelation iv, 10-11; xi, 16; xix, 4) and 83 J.

These mosaics are very badly preserved. Apocalyptic features can also be found in representations of the Transfiguration in the apse of the church of S. Apollinaire in Classe in Ravenna. By the arms of the cross, which represents Christ, there are the letters A and ) (Ap. i, 8 and xxi, 6)--see Dinkler (as in n. 6), p. 68; Deichmann (as in n. 68), Kommentar, ii, pp. 255f.</page><page sequence="15">56 JERZY MIZIOLEK the latter shows Christ with the twelve Apostles and the Apocalyptic candelabra (Revelation i, 12 and iv, 5). Assuming that the Sinai mosaic carries a reference to the Apocalypse, one may also suppose that the medallion bust of David is related to what Christ says of himself in Revelation (xxii, 16): 'I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and morning star.' As suggested earlier, the rays which emanate from the Sinai Christ could be reminiscent of a star. The verse in Revelation echoes Numbers (xxiv, 17) ('star out of Jacob'), and perhaps other biblical star references, and is related to II Peter i, 18-19, which speaks of the day star in connection with the Transfiguration:9' And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him (Christ) in the holy mount. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. Although one cannot be sure exactly which 'word of prophecy' is intended, the verses quoted from the Apocalypse and II Peter seem to suggest that the Sinai Transfiguration could also represent the prophecy which foretells the fulfilment of the glory of the Son of David, the Messiah.92 Again we are close to the idea of Christ as the true Light and perhaps close to the idea of the true Sun. Two Syriac authorities may be cited: Ephraem in the Diatessaron links the star of Jacob with the Sun of justice and the star of the Magi with Oriens (ex alto) (Luke i, 78);9 in the De coelesti hierarchia, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite writes that the divinity is concealed beneath subtle 'forms'-sometimes it may be the Sun of righteousness, sometimes the day star rising in the hearts of the faithful, and it could also be the spiritual light whose rays embrace us.94 91 Biblical star references have been studied excel- lently by J. Danielou, 'The Star of Jacob', in idem, Primitive Christian Symbols, transl. D. Attwater, London 1964, pp. 102-23; see also idem, Theologie du judeo- christianisme, Paris 1958, pp. 237-47. For patristic commentaries on the 'morning star', see D6lger 1940 (as in n. 47), pp. 18-21 and 31-36. 92 Danielou 1964 (as in n. 91), pp. 109-10. In the second half of the sixth century in his Commentary on Revelation (xxii, 16) Bishop Andreas of Caesarea wrote: '... Christ "is the bright and morning star." Just as he rose for us on the morning after his three days of death; even so, after the term of this present life, in the morning hour of the general resurrection he will reveal himself gloriously to all his saints, surely bringing in a day that will have no end'; see PG, cvi, cols 449-51. It may be of interest to note that the pagan god Radu was worshipped in the Sinai region under the guise of the morning star. Also Isthar was worshipped under the same figure as the goddess of victory. These cults were still alive in the fifth century. Hence the concept of Christ as the rising day star could have been used to assimilate these cults. For the pagan worship of the morning star on Mount Sinai see H. Skrobucha, Sinai, transl. G. Hunt, London 1966, p. 4. 93 Ephraem Syrus, Commentaire de l'Evangile concordant ou Diatessaron, ed. and transl. L. Leloir, Paris 1966, pp. 63f, and 318f. It is worth quoting in this context a passage from the Eastern liturgy for Christmas, which though referring not to the Transfiguration but to the Nativity, gives an interesting example of the star-sun symbolism: 'Thy birth, Christ our God, has risen for the universe as a light of spiritual knowledge; for through thy birth the star-worshippers have learned from the Star to prostrate themselves before thee as before the Sun of righteousness and to recognise thee as the Sunrise from on high', cited from Kantorowicz (as in n. 60), p. 141. Cf. also Gregory of Nazianzus (Oratio xl, 5-6) who writes beautifully about 'the mystery of Light' in which Moses on Sinai, Elijah, the 'Beauty of the star', the Transfiguration and other visions are mentioned; see PG, xxxvi, cols 363ff, English translation in McGuckin (as in n. 51), p. 169f.

Interesting comparisons occur also in other treatises by Dionysius; see De divinis nominibus, i, 6 and iv, 4; in this latter case the sun is called the shining star, and Dionysius compares the sun with God's goodness. It is worth adding that Philo in De opificio mundi, xxxi, calls the intelligible light, created by, and an image of, the Logos, a supercelestial star; see Philo, ed. F. H. Colson, i, London 1929, p. 24.</page><page sequence="16">TRANSFIGURATIO DOMINI AND SYMBOLISM OF LIGHT 57 It was the opinion of early Christian writers that the image of the Transfigured Christ contained another fundamental truth which concerns the resurrection of Christ's followers at the end of time. In his Commentary on Luke, Cyril of Alexandria writes: But in the time of resurrection a kind of divine transformation will take place, a change in glory rather than a change in form, and then the body clothed in divine glory will be radiant and the just will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of the Father, as the Saviour said. And so we see the Transfiguration was an example of that glory that is to come, given to the Disciples and revealed in a bodily way to fall under the scope of mortal eyes, even though they could not bear the immensity of the radiance (v, 29).95 Christ's words in Matthew (xiii, 43), 'Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun ..', were quoted repeatedly in homilies and commentaries in connection with the miracle of the holy mountain (for instance by Gregory of Nazianzus,96 John Chrysostom97 and Leo the Great).9s The vision of the future conveyed in the Transfiguration finds perhaps its most beautiful expression in a passage of Pseudo- Dionysius the Areopagite: Hereafter, when we have come to be indestructible and immortal and have attained a most blessed and Christ-like lot, 'we shall', as the writings say, 'be always with the Lord' (I Thess. iv, 17) and shall be filled with his visible theophany in the holy contemplations which shall illumine us with the most brilliant splendours as the Disciples were in that most divine Transfiguration ... We shall share in the unity beyond intellect in the unknown and blessed radiations of the rays that are beyond every light. Thus shall we be a more divine imitation of the super-celestial intellects. For as the truth of the writings says, 'we shall be equal to the angels and will be sons of God by being sons of the resurrection' (Luke, xx, 36).99 It is also worth noting a passsage from the Apocalypse of Peter. Though apocryphal, Sozomen tells us that it was read in Palestinian churches on Good Friday.'oo The passage is as follows: And the Lord continued and said, 'Let us go to the mountain and pray.' And we the twelve Disciples went with him and entreated him to show us one of our righteous brethren who had departed from the world, that we might see in what form they are, and taking courage might encourage the men who should hear us. And as we prayed, suddenly there appeared two men standing before the Lord, on whom we were not able to look. For there went forth from their countenance a ray as of the sun, and their raiment was shining such as the eye of 95 Transl. in McGuckin (as in n. 51), p. 181; for Greek text see PG, lxxii col. 656.

And I approached the Lord and said 'who are these?' He said to me, 'They are your righteous brethren whose form you did desire to see.' And I said to him, 'And where are the righteous, and what is the nature of that world in which these are who possess such glory?' And the Lord showed me a widely extensive place outside this world all gleaming with light, and the air there flooded by the rays of the sun.1?1 If the rays in the Sinai Transfiguration are eight in number, a brief review of the symbolic significance of the number eight may be in order. From the second century onwards this holy number was discussed by both the Greek and Latin Fathers as well as by other Christian authors.102 Gregory of Nyssa wrote in the Treatise on the titles of the Psalms that at the end of time the eighth day would come and it would not be brightened by the earthly sun but by the true light, the Sun of righteousness, Christus-Oriens. 103s Furthermore there is a text which helps us greatly to understand the role of eight rays in the Transfiguration. St Ambrose in his Expositio in Lucam, says: How was it that Peter, James and John did not taste death but looked upon the glory of the resurrection? For about eight days after these words--'There are some standing here who shall not taste death'-he took up only these three and led them up the mountain. What then is the meaning of this phrase 'eight days' after these words? It means that the man who hears and believes the word of Christ shall see his glory in the time of the resurrection. For the resurrection is accomplished on the eighth day. This is why so many Psalms bear the title 'On the eighth'. Perhaps it was that he might show us why he had said that the man who loses his life on account of the word of God shall save it since he makes good his promises in the resurrection (vii, 6).104 The symbolic eight is present both in architecture-eight columns, eight-sided baptistries with their reference to the Resurrection lo--and in figural represen- tation. In the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna eight apostles acclaim a bright cross which symbolises Christ in the centre of the dome.106 The cross is 101 E. Hennecke and W.

Both the inscription (In the Name of [God] the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost ...) and the three concentric circles inside the mandorla, each of a different shade of blue, have a Trinitarian connotation.108 Comparisons of the Holy Trinity with light, including solar metaphors, occur frequently in the writings of early Christian authors.'9 For example Gregory of Nazianzus writes that the Holy Trinity is the indivisible deity composed of separate persons, resembling three joined suns which together emit one bright light."0 Similar comparisons have been made by Ephraem Syrus and other writers."i Anastasius I, Bishop of Antioch from 559 after he had been a monk in Sinai, identified God the Father with the sun, the Son with its rays, and the Holy Spirit with the warmth that they produce.112 This is echoed five centuries later by Theophylact of Achrida. 113 The image of Christ in a mandorla composed of three concentric ovals emitting eight rays can be related to two other mosaic representations, a contemporary one on the wall of the triumphal arch in S. Vitale in Ravenna (P1. 7b) 114 and a mosaic, no longer extant, on the bema of the Dormition church in Nicaea, which dates from the sixth or seventh century (P1. 8b)."1 In S. Vitale two angels, flying among the buildings which stand for Jerusalem and Bethlehem, support a medallion depicting a type of cross formed from eight equal arms and inscribed in the centre with the letter 'A'. These arms also seem to be rays of light, initially red, turning first to orange and then to white. The decoration in the Nicaean church is known to have included a medallion depicting a throne set against three concentric blue circles. A book and a cross bearing the dove of the Holy Spirit in the centre were placed on the throne. Four rays of light emanated from the angles of the cross. The arms of the cross turned into rays, thus creating an eight-ray motif, as in S. Vitale. No doubt a Trinitarian reference, perhaps also a solar one, was intended in these 107 See Ihm (as in n. 2), pp. 86-88 and figs 21-22; bibliographical references on p. 88 in nos 38a-b. 108 For the Trinitarian features of the Sinai Metamor- phosis see Weitzmann (as in n. 2), pp. 401ff; idem, ill Forsyth &amp; Weitzmann (as in n. 1), pp. 12ff; de' Maffei (as in n. 9), passim.

A partially preserved icon in the Sinai monastery dating from the sixth or seventh century seems to supply proof of the Trinitarian aspect in the Sinai image.116" This icon was originally a triptych showing on the inside the Virgin flanked by Moses and Elijah, and outside, a symbolic representation of the Transfiguration- the cross in a mandorla composed of three concentric circles, from which emanate four 'bunches' of rays. There are numerous examples from the first millennium of the theophany with the motif of rays.11"' In most cases their relationship to solar symbolism is difficult to prove. In the Sinai Transfiguration, however, this relationship seems undeniable owing to the presence of the eight-pointed star-popular symbol of the sun. When applying it to the mosaic, the artist illustrated the essential truths of Revelation. The Transfigured Christ-the Sun of righteousness-placed among Elijah, Moses and other prophets, as well as the Apostles and the Evangelists, is presented as 'the Lord of both the Old and the New Covenants'. The scene looks back to Sinai and anticipates the Resurrection, the Second Coming, and holds the promise to the righteous of a 'change into the same image'.
