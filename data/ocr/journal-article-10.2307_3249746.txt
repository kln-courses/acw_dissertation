<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER SMITH THE CEILING OF THE MUKTESVARA TEMPLE IN BHUBANESWAR he Mukte'vara temple in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, was built around 960 A.D., and marks the beginning of what can be called the mature phase of temple architecture in this region of India (fig. i). The temple is of outstanding interest primarily for this pivotal position within the stylistic development of Orissan architecture. It is of equal interest, however, for various features which appear very rarely in Orissan temples.' It is my purpose here to discuss just one of these unique features, the elaborately sculpted ceiling of the temple'sjagamohana, or forehall (figs. 2,3). The focus of this article will be upon the ceiling's narrative content and its symbolic meaning. The ceiling can be interpreted as a narrative tableau depicting key events in the mythology of Siva and Pdrvati, specifically, the Penance of Pdrvati, while also bearing reference to the births of Gane'a and Kdrttikeya, with particular emphasis upon the latter's relationship to the Krttikds, the Wives of the Seven Sages. It can also be interpreted as a mandala, a circular diagram wherein is expressed a whole complex of metaphysical meaning. The mandala imagery of the Muktesvara ceiling can be read in several ways. It represents on one level deities emanating from the center, who can be identified with various aspects of the celestial realm of existence. On another level it represents a concept of greater abstraction, where the mandala can be seen as an exposition on the theory of the mantras, the basic constituents of a complex system of sound symbolism, which had become highly developed during the early medieval period. This esoteric meaning becomes clear as we compare the ceiling's imagery with ideas expressed in various religious texts, generally accepted as dating to the early medieval period.2 These texts, which can be typified as Tantric in nature, contain striking parallels with the ceiling's imagery, as we shall see when various correspondences are made. As implied above, the very occurrence of a sculpted ceiling is virtually unique in Orissa, for as a rule, the interiors of both thejagamohana and garbha grha (inner shrine) are absolulety 1 Among various eclectic features, the intricate gavdk4a network decorating the vertical salients (rathas) of the Mukteivara's likhara and lower walls occurs on three other Orissan temples fairly contemporary with the Muktesvara (the so-called twin temples at Gandharadi, the three Siva temples at Baudh, the Paficdyatana temple at Ganeswarpur), also on the RdjardnI temple, Bhubaneswar, c. iooo A.D., but in this particular form on no other subsequent monuments. Eclectic also is the pyramidal roof of thejagamohana, which occurs for the first time in Orissa on the Mukteivara. This feature, however, has a longer life than the gavdkSa network, and becomes a standard feature on all subsequent Orissan temples. 2 For the dating of the texts under discussion I rely primarily on the opinions expressed in Sanjukta Gupta, Dirk Jan Hoens, and Teun Goudriaan, Hindu Tantrism (Leiden: E.J. Brill, i979); and Jan Gonda, Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1977). 73</page><page sequence="2">plain.3 Briefly, the Muktesvara ceiling consists of a system of five progressively receding stone courses (figs. 2,3,4). The first (that is, the central, innermost one), is square, the next three are octagonal, and the fifth (the outermost) is rectangular. They are elaborately carved with various decorative motifs, and narrative relief scenes within the triangular and trapezoidal panels formed at their corners. At the center of the ceiling, within the innermost course, is a fairly deep "dome," having the shape of an eight-petaled lotus. These lotus petals are actually cusped niches within which are placed images of the Sapta Mdtrkds (Seven Mother Goddesses), and their attendant, Virabhadra. These images seem to emanate from the absolute center of the ceiling, a multi-petaled lotus medallion. Surround- ing this whole central composition are six relief panels. Those within the second course depict the gods Skanda (Kdrttikeya) and Gane'a. Within the third course are two scenes of musicians and dancers, and two narrative panels depicting women in meditation. The fourth stone course has at its four corners nearly identical triangular relief panels, each representing a solitary woman seated in meditative posture. The fifth and lowest stone course is rectangular, and bears images of kirti mukhas at the corners. These corner reliefs take the form of triangular braces and are placed at the juncture between the wall and ceiling proper (fig. 4). It is not the major concern here to trace the specific stylistic sources for the Muktesvara ceiling. It will be informative, however, to show very broadly the formal and conceptual parameters from which the Muktesvara ceiling receives inspiration. Perhaps the earliest surviving Hindu ceiling sculpture can be seen in the temples of the early Chalukya dynasty. These ceilings are flat, rather than being made up of receding stone courses. An elaborate central lotus is the main motif, this sometimes being surrounded by narrative panels, images of deities, or dikpdlas.4 Ceilings with greater formal similarity to the Mukte'vara's, consisting of progressively receding and overlapping stone courses, are found at various sites throughout northern India, for example in the Buddhist temple 45 at Sanchi (c. 857),s in the garbha grba of the Laksmana temple, Khajuraho (c. 953), and at a site so remote from Orissa as Pandrethan, Kashmir (Siva temple, c. Ioth century).6 It can be stated from the outset that these carved Indian ceilings bear, at least in a general sense, a celestial symbolism, and that their ultimate origins, both formal and symbolic, can be traced in part to certain western influences coming in through Gandhara, in the northwest. In his seminal article on the symbolism of the dome, Karl Lehman 3 Only one other Orissan temple has a sculpted ceiling, the Brahmeivara in Bhubaneswar. It is perhaps because of its uniqueness that the Mukteivara ceiling has received little discussion in scholarly literature. For very brief mentions see K.C. Panigrahi, Archaeological Remains in Bhubaneswar (Bombay: Orient Longmans, i961), p. 88; Debala Mitra, Bhubaneswar, 4th ed.

In a subsequent article, Alexander Soper applies Lehman's findings to ceiling decoration in Asia, and gives credit to the Bactrian Greeks for introducing ceilings with celestial symbolism into the architecture of India.8 While no Gandharan period ceiling survives, the ceiling from Pandrethan serves as an acceptable reflection of what the basic layout of these earlier works might have looked like, since Kashmiri architecture from the medieval period is generally recognized as a provincial carryover of Gandharan building practices.' Soper gives less attention to the indigenous sources which contributed to the form of these ceilings. Two Indian elements seem of particular relevance here; the lotus medallion, the earliest examples of which are found on the railings and gateways of Buddhist stupas, and the stupa itself, or more precisely, its plan. The symbolism of the lotus medallion and the stiipa plan is closely interconnected, and, it should be pointed out, figures importantly in the form and symbolism of the mandala, of which the Muktesvara ceiling is an architec- tural example. Lotus medallions are first seen decorating the balustrades of stupa railings and stupa gateways, where they sometimes bear symbolic imagery.1? By the Kushan period, large lotus canopies were used to cover images of the Buddha. One such canopy in the Mathura Museum, for example, is square in shape, with the central full-blown lotus motif carved as an inscribed circle." Eight auspicious symbols are incised along one edge of the square canopy. A similar conception can be seen in the much later temple 45 at Sanchi, cited earlier, where the ceiling itself is conceived as a lotus umbrella, placed over the head of the Buddha figure below. Conceptually, these lotus canopies, particularly those including symbols, can be read in a way similar to the well known mandala paintings of the late medieval period,12 in that both are symbolic equivalents of the Buddha and all the aspects of his nature. The umbrella, placed above the anthropomorphic image, itself serves as a kind of abstracted icon, reduced to essential symbolic forms. The stupa plan as a source for the prominent directional symbolism of the manmdala has been clearly set forth by David Snellgrove in his work on the Hevajra Tantra. To summarize, both the traditional stupa and the standard Tantric mai.dala consist of an inner 7 Karl Lehman, "The Dome of Heaven," Art Bulletin 27 (1945), P. 2 and fig. z. 8 Alexander Soper, "The Dome of Heaven in Asia," Art Bulletin 29 (1947), P. 227. 9 Roy Craven, A Concise History of Indian Art (New York: Praeger, I979), p. 176; Michell, Hindu Temple, p. 127. o10 For illustrations see Benimadhab Baruha, Barhut: Stone as a Story Teller (1934; reprint Patna: Indological Book Corporation, 1979), pl. 34, fig. 25 (lotus medallion from stipa railing); and Marshall and Foucher, Sdfchi, vol. 2, pl. 5o (Stupa I, pillars of east gateway), pl. 43 (front of eastern gateway, north end, showing a lotus medallion surmounted by a triratna), vol. 3, pl. 74 (Stapa II, reliefs on ground balustrade), pl. 76 (reliefs on ground balustrade, especially fig. 13b, showing a wheel within the lotus), and passim. 11 R.C.

Both give utmost importance to the center, conveying the idea of emanation from the center into surrounding space.13 It is the basic symbolic system embodied in the stupa and the lotus medallion that finds its most complex and developed form in mandalas of the later medieval period. What I wish to discuss presently is that the ceiling of the Muktesvara temple was conceived in terms of a definite mandala symbolism. This will be preceded, however, by a detailed description, and a discussion of the narrative aspects of the ceilings's imagery. Description At the center of the ceiling is a square stone relief panel recessed in from its enclosing square stone course, three increasingly larger octagon-shaped courses, and a rectangular course, marking the juncture between ceiling and wall. Contained within the central square space is a circular, dome-like structure made up of eight cusped lotus-shaped niches. The four corners of the enclosing square contain figures of ndga couples, their serpent tails coiling along the sides, while their upper (human) forms meet in embrace at the corners. The inner-most octagonal course creates space for two trapezoidal relief panels at the east and west end of the ceiling. The second octagonal course creates four similarly shaped panels at its four corners. At the center of all four sides of this course, which are bordered with a sequence of wide flat lotus petals, are attached high relief figures of flying gandharva couples. The outermost octagonal course has triangular, rather than trapezoidal relief panels. Placed between these second and third levels of relief panels, and having the illusion of being supporting elements, are high relief images of garland-bearing ndgas. At the four lowest corners of the ceiling are triangular relief panels of kirti mukhas. Placed between these lower triangular panels, and again acting as supporting-connecting elements, are figures of rearing leogryphs. At the very center of the lotus-shaped "dome" is a circular disk circumscribed by three rings, each consisting of sixteen lotus petals. The disk is incised with a crescent moon, one of the most well known attributes of Siva. The eight lotus-form cusped niches surrounding this central medallion each contain an image of one of the Sapta Mdtrkds and Virabhadra (figs. 5 and 6). All the figures sit upon elaborate lotus pedestals in lalitisana (one leg drawn up, the other hanging down). Behind them, carved in low relief, are up side-down lotuses on stalks, which appear to grow out from the central lotus. Each of the Mother images, except the horrific Cgmundi, holds a baby within the crook of the left arm. The Sapta Mitrkis are widely represented on relief friezes, usually in a specific order, beginning on the left with VIrabhadra.14 This standard order is followed on the MukteS- 13 David Snellgrove, The Hevajra Tantra: A Critical Study (London: Oxford University Press, I959), part i, pp. 29-3 1, 39, and 72-73.

Virabhadra here is four-armed (as are all the deities in this circular composition). His upper right hand holds a flower, while with his upper left and lower right hands he plays a vina. At his feet is the bull Nandin, marking Virabhadra as an aspect of Siva. Six of the Seven Mothers are conceived as the female energies (saktis) of major male deities, as is indicated by their names; Brahmdni has at the foot of her pedestal two facing swans, the vehicle of her counterpart, Brahmd. Her two upper hands hold indistinct objects. Siva's counterpart, Mahesvari, like Virabhadra, has a bull at her feet. Her upper hands hold a mdld (rosary) and possibly a damard (hourglass-shaped drum). Kaumdri, Skanda's counter- part, has that god's animal vehicle, the peacock, at her feet. Her upper right hand holds a weapon. Vaisnavi holds a conch and a discus. She wears the tall conical crown charac- teristic of Visnu. Vardhi has the head of a boar and is pot bellied. At her feet is a cow, an allusion to her counterpart Varaha's rescue of the Earth Goddess from the subterranean regions. She holds two indistinct objects in her upper hands. Indrdni (Indra's counterpart), has an elephant at her feet. She holds a mace in her upper left hand and a vajra (thunderbolt) in her right. Cimundd is the only Mother not conceived as the counterpart of a male deity, and the only one not depicted with a child. She is a skeletal figure, and her emaciated left leg reaches down toward the figure of a corpse placed below her lotus-seat. Her upper left hand carries a spear-like weapon. The trapezoidal relief panel to the west of the central composition depicts Ganeia, the elephant-headed son of Siva and Pdrvati, who with Virabhadra usually figures as an attendant of the Seven Mothers (fig. 7). The six-armed figure holds a cobra above his head with his two upper hands, and with his others holds an axe, mld, and his broken tusk (the lowest left hand is broken off). He dances, imitating the dance of Siva (which is depicted on the outside of the temple, on the four sides of the jikhara), upon a low lotus platform. Flanking Ganesa on the lower side of the trapezoid are two musician figures, playing drums and cymbols, while at the feet of the drummer is a rat, the god's animal vehicle (vahana). Above the musicians are two larger ganas who stand upon open lotuses, the stalks of which grow from behind the musicians. On the opposite (eastern) side of the ceiling is a depiction of Kdrttikeya, Siva's other son, and the general of the army of the gods (fig. 8). The youthful, two-armed figure sits on a low lotus pedestal, holding a long spear in his left hand. To his right is placed a peacock, his usual vahana, and to his left, a rooster, another animal often associated with him. The upper levels of the composition contain three celestial figures (one to the god's right, two to his left), holding weapons and lotuses.'s Two long and narrow relief panels flank both the Ganeha and Kgrttikeya reliefs.

She sits cross- legged, with her hands in her lap (dhyana mudrd), and is flanked by four attending maid- servants, who offer gifts of food. Stylistically and iconographically, all five figures are of the same type as those on the outer walls of the temple, that is, they are voluptuously proportioned figures beautifully adorned with bracelets, anklets, necklaces, and jewelled girdles. The central figure, however, is slightly larger than her attendants, denoting a special rank. The panel to the right of Ganeia depicts a group of female musicians, all seated on the ground. Two are playing long Indian drums, while another plays a flute. Two smaller figures are placed in the upper corners, to the left a female figure holding an offering, and to the right another figure playing a drum (fig. io). To the left of the Skanda relief is a meditation scene similar to the one just mentioned (fig. 1i). Again flanked by female attendants, here the central female figure holds her hands together with palms facing outward. The hands are badly damaged, as are the face, and the faces of the attendant figures to the left. This relief, along with the similar scene flanking the image of Ganesa will be discussed below as a depiction of the Penance of Parvati. The panel to the right of Kdrttikeya depicts a female dancer in the center, surrounded by four musicians. In her foot positions and gestures, the central dancer seems to be imitating, like Ganesa, the dance of Siva (fig. 12). The four triangular reliefs below the trapezoidal ones show essentially the same scene; a woman seated in meditative posture upon a lotus pedestal, flanked by rearing leogryphs (fig. 3). There is slight variation in the poses, two of the figures sit in the siddhdsana (adept's pose), while the two others sit in a more relaxed posture, similar to the posture mahdrdjall'd.16 The supporting leogryph below the southwest panel is missing, and below the lotus pedestal the indentation within which the leogryph was originally attached is visible (see fig. 2). Narrative Aspects of the Ceiling On a basic narrative level, the ceiling reliefs represent key events in the legend of Siva's family. The two trapezoidal meditation scenes represent the Penances of Pdrvati, Siva's consort.17" This can be ascertained by comparing the reliefs to mythic accounts of this story, found in various Purdnic texts, which recount how Parvati resorted to asceticism on various occasions. Two particular episodes record major events in Siva's and Pirvati's mythology. The goddess first took up austerities in order to win Siva, himself the implacable yogin, as her husband.18 Parvati's second retreat to the ascetic grove was the result of an insult from her husband. Highly offended when, referring to her dark skin 16 C.

Panigrahi does not discuss, however, how the identification was arrived at. 18 Siva Purdna, edited by J.L.

In reaching this goal she won the appelation Gauri, or "Golden One."'"19 The developmental sequence in both penance episodes is quite similar - beginning with the goddess's departure to the Himalayan forests, progressing to the penance itself, the attainment of the fruits of asceticism in the form of boons from gods or sages, and finally, union or reunion with Siva. The goddess arrives at her remote mountain retreat, both times accompanied by hand maidens. One account of her second bout with asceticism specifically states, however, that four goddesses; Jayd, Vijayd, Jayanti and Aparajitd; were called to mind by the goddess and then "began to render necessary services."20 At the end of countless years, Parvati's goals were attained on both counts. In various versions of the earlier episode, it is announced to Pdrvati either by the Seven Seers (great legendary figures very prominent in the Epics and Purdnas), the god Brahma, or Siva himself, that the god would marry her.21 The second time, the goddess's asceticism found the particular favor of Brahmd, who caused her to shed her dark skin, and attain a golden complexion.22 When Siva and Pdrvati were reunited, a series of complex events following their intense love-making resulted in the birth of Kdrttikeya.23 Because of the lack of very specific narrative details in these reliefs, it cannot be precisely determined which panel represents which event. In the scene to the west, the goddess sits in quiet meditation, at the beginning, or in the midst of her long austerities. In the eastern panel, her hands are raised in a specific gesture. Although damaged, her hands seem to be joined at the thumbs and open outward, in a kind of expanded adjali, the gesture of greeting. Her hand pose is very similar to one described in the medieval text on dramatic dance gesture, the Abhinayadarpana. According to this text, the gesture, called kapota (dove) is made by joining the hands at the sides, base, and top. The gesture can variously indicate the taking of an oath, salutation, addressing a preceptor, or humble acquiescence or agreement.24 As a gesture of oath taking, it is appropriate to the goddess's vow that she would remain an ascetic until her goals were accomplished. On the other hand, the gesture would serve also as an appropriate reply to the Seven Seers, or especially to Brahmd, with Parvati humbly acknowledging the god's favor to her.

Although the figures of the meditating women are centrally placed and symmetrically flanked, the relaxed poses of the figures negate any strong iconic impression. The figures seem to be general representations of Pdrvati's penance, showing no particular episode, but in their repetition, make this the pervading narrative theme of the ceiling's program. Gane'a and Skanda, the two sons of Siva and Pdrvatl, are depicted on the two largest relief panels, at the west and east end of the ceiling respectively. That the Gane'a relief may represent the birth of this god is indicated by a passage from the Linga Purin.a, stating that as soon as he was born, "the embodied form of gentleness, and terrific in appearance, the abode of all auspiciousness, Gane'a danced."25 The particular pose of the figure, holding a cobra above his head, indicates that his dance is imitative of that of his father. That the dancing form of Ganesa was popular in eastern India can be seen in several examples from Bengal and Orissa.26 The image of Skanda represents the god in a basically iconic form, devoid of any narrative references. The central image of the ceiling, the circle of the Seven Mother Goddesses, however, can be seen as refering specifically to Skanda's birth, in that the Sapta Mdtrkds can here be identified with the Krttikds, the nursemaids of Skanda. The cult of the Seven Mothers, which had been gaining popularity in northern India from the 6th or 7th century, found particular favor in medieval Orissa, as can be seen in the many surviving sculptural depictions of them.27 The most complete mythological account of the Seven Mothers is in the DeviMdhdtmya, a text glorifying the exploits of the great goddess Durgd, the slayer of Mahisdsura, the Buffalo Demon.28 Here the Mothers, created out of the energy of their male counterparts for the purpose of battle, are depicted as ferocious demon slayers. The first six goddesses; Brahmani, Maheivari, Kaumari, Vaisnavi, Vardhi, and Indrrni; are female versions of the male deities Brahmd, Siva, Skanda, Visnu, Vardha, and Indra. Cdmundd is an independent figure, although she too was created for battle against Mahisdsura and other demons. The Mothers on the Muktesvara ceiling have been iden- tified earlier in this article by their various attributes, headdresses, and animal vehicles. At the northwest section of the circle is Virabhadra, an aspect of Siva, who here, and in almost all representations of the Seven Mothers, holds a vwnd (a long-necked instrument resem- bling a lute). By the time their cult was codified, the Mothers had acquired - but for the emaciated 25Linga Purdna I.Io5.II, translated in Kramrisch, Manifestations of Shiva, p. 74.

This emphasis upon the goddesses' maternal nature is important, for it points to their connection with the Krttikds. The Krttikds are one of the many feminine heptads mentioned throughout Sanskrit literature and are identified with the constellation Pleiades.29 In every version of the Birth of Kdrttikeya, the Krttikds (from whom his name derives) play a greater or lesser role, sometimes actually becoming collectively pregnant with the divine embryo, other times acting only as his nurse-maids.30 A relief frieze from the Kushan period (2nd to 3rd century A.D.) depicting Kdrttikeya and seven undifferentiated female figures is clearly a prototype for later Sapta Mdtrkd representations.31 In later renditions, including that of the Mukte'- vara ceiling, Skanda's place is taken over by Virabhadra, who as a youthful, comely, but at times ferocious god, and who is, moreover, an offspring of Siva, bears a certain resemblance to the more mythologically appropriate Skanda.32 In the Muktesvara ceiling, however, with the close proximity of the image of Skanda on the eastern trapezoidal relief with those of the Seven Mothers at the center, the latters' identity with the Krttikds becomes strongly reestablished, showing perhaps that this identity was never really lost sight of totally. The entire ceiling, then, constitutes both an iconic and narrative representation of Siva and his family. Siva himself is represented abstractly as a crescent moon at the center of the lotus medallion. His wife Pdrvati is shown twice (perhaps even six times), engaged in ascetic practices having highly important consequences. The two most iconic images on the ceiling, those of Skanda and Ganesa, are shown in ways that make allusions to their births; Gane'a, who danced at his birth, and Skanda, whose birth is referred to by the presence of the Krttikds, his nurses. The Ceiling's Mamndala Symbolism A more esoteric level of meaning also exists in the imagery of the Muktesvara ceiling, which when considered as a whole, becomes a three-dimensional mandala. On a primary level, a mandala can constitute an image of the universe, which emanates from a supreme 29 For discussions of female heptads see Harper, "Sapta-mdtrkds," Stella Kramrisch, "The Indian Great Goddess," History of Religions 14.4 (May, 1975), pp. 235-265 (especially pp. z6z-z63), and J.N.

In this text he is described as horrific in appearance (Rao, Hindu Iconographby vol. 2 part I, pp. 18z-183). In the DevT Bhdgavata Purana (7-30), Virabhadra is engendered by Siva, along with the army of Bhadrakll (O'Flaherty, Hindu Myths, p. 25 I). In the Matsya Purdna Virabhadra, described as "covered with buckskin, clean in person ... wearing the wreath of stone heads, with handsome form," becomes the adopted son of Pdrvati (Taluqdar of Oudh trans., 154-550, ff. (pp. Ioy-Io6)).

One of the clearest expressions of this idea is found in a mandala conceived specifically within the symbolic context of the Hindu temple, and so is appropriate to this discussion, the vastupurusaman- d ala.33 At the center of this square grid diagram is Brahmd, the creator god, identified here with Brahman, the neuter, unmanifest absolute. Surrounding Brahmd are various gods from the Vedic pantheon, including at the outer borders the eight guardians of the directions. In Utpala's commentary on the Brhat Sambitd, the gods of the vdstupurusaman- dala are identified with various celestial bodies (the planets and constellations), and the diagram as a whole constitutes a cosmic map, embodying all aspects of celestial manifesta- tion as emanations of the absolute.34 It seems possible that in the Muktesvara ceiling the Seven Mothers with Virabhadra have a symbolism comparable to that of the eight dikpdlas of the vdstupurusaman.dala, i.e., as representations of the directions and the planets. First of all, the very number of images in the central circle (eight) suggests a directional symbolism, and we should keep in mind that from its earliest conception, the mandala had a strong directional orientation,35 the directions being symbolic of infinity. The presence of celestial symbolism becomes even more clear in that in their identification with the Krttikds, the Mothers represent the Pleiades, one of the constellations, or lunar mansions. The Mahdbhdrata states that "after having fed Skanda, the Krttikds entered into the sphere of the stars."36 This identification with the Krttikds perhaps influenced the strong connection made between the Seven Mothers in certain other contexts specifically with the planets. There are a number of north Indian temples which superimpose friezes of the Seven Mothers with Virabhadra and Ganesa over door lintels bearing images of the Navagrahas (the "Nine Graspers"), the seven planets plus the ascending and descending nodes of the moon.37 The Mothers themselves are, in fact, also described in the Mahdbhdrata as grahas, and the use of this term is clearly denotative of their role as planetary powers. In this role, we see a dark side to the nature of the Mothers, to whom Skanda gives power over the fates of children to the age of sixteen.38 Inscriptional remains refer to the goddesses as "mothers of the seven worlds,"39 and the Mahdbhdrata calls them "great mothers of the universe."40 While these 33 For a complete discussion of the vdstupurusamandala see Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple (Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1946), vol.

There is reason to suggest, therefore, that the Seven Mothers with Virabhadra represent on the Muktesvara ceiling both the eight directions and the planets, and are thus conceived as the constituents of the celestial sphere of existence, emanating from the Absolute.41 The remaining imagery of the ceiling is consistent with a cosmological interpretation. The four narrative reliefs flanking Karttikeya and Ganesa represent particular events occuring on the terrestrial plane, while attached to the lower parts of the ceiling, below these reliefs, are high relief figures of nagas, deities of the subterranian world, who serve here as the earthly supports of a celestial canopy. A further level of symbolism can be discerned through a correspondence that stands between much of the ceiling's imagery and various aspects of Tantric metaphysics. An interesting connection can be seen, first of all, between the naga couples occupying the corners of the square enclosing the lotus medallion and the abstract representation of the Absolute at the center. According to the Kiranagama, a Saivite text which dates before the ioth century, the phenomenal world is created through the interaction of Siva's lakti, or female energy, and Ananta, the great serpent who supports the earth.42 Ananta is more usually seen in a Vaisnava context. The Kiranagama, however, describes him as an aspect of Siva, specifically a creative aspect, who through interaction with Sakti, "gives birth to a series of derivitives which constitute the world."43 Their union is depicted on the Muktesvara ceiling through the image of the serpent couples, who on the perifery of the mandala preside over the earthly levels of creation. The disk at the very center of the lotus medallion, if interpreted as the center of a mandala, represents the Absolute. It can be stated even more specifically, however, that we have here symbolized the transcendental union of Siva and Sakti. The incised crescent moon at the center of the lotus certainly must be taken as a symbol for Siva, being one of his most well known symbols. The full-blown lotus within which it is placed is equally well known as an emblem of the Supreme Goddess. The lotus as a symbol of the Goddess appears as early as the first century B.C.44 The symbol's continuity into the medieval period can be seen in several images of lotus-headed goddesses,45 and more relevant to this study, in the large heraldic gavdksa (arched window) reliefs identically placed on three sides of the likhara of a temple dedicated specifically to the Goddess, the Gauri temple at Bhubane- 41 That the planets usually were conceived as male does not necessarily repudiate these views. Other transformations of the identities of celestial bodies can be seen in Indian literature, for example in Mahdbhdrata 1.6o.I3-I6 (Van Buitenen trans., vol. I, p. 148), where the 27 constellations, or lunar mansions (the groups of stars through which the moon passes in its route across the heavens) are conceived as all female: "27 wives are known in the world to be the moon's, these faithful wives of the moon are appointed to the procession of time. They are the fairies of the lunar mansions, which regulate the life of the world." 42 H.

Here the closed lotus is displayed on the heraldic device held by two dwarfish attendants. A similar gavdksa motif is seen on the superstructure of the Mukteivara itself, where the lotus, rather than being represented alone, has placed before it a smaller gavaksa bearing a face, probably meant to indicate that of Siva (fig. 15I).46 It is this same motif of the Goddess as lotus, together with Siva, that appears more abstractly in the interior ceiling, where at the apex of the mandala, Siva and Sakti are the absolute center from which all existence emanates. With the images of the Mdtrkds on the eight surrounding lotus petal cusps, and the abstracted symbol of the Absolute at the center, the Muktesvara ceiling resembles both formally and conceptually, Hindu and Buddhist man.dalas of the later medieval period, which represent deities surrounding a central figure symbolic of the absolute principle from which they emanate.47 A great number of mapndalas of the later medieval period, however, often have placed on their major divisions not images, but rather, mantras, the sacred and magically potent sound elements which assume such great importance in Tantric ideology.48 I would like to suggest here that mantra symbolism has a prominent role in the total symbolism of the Muktesvara ceiling. As stated by Dirk Jan Hoens in the book Hindu Tantrism, "one of the most essential traits of Tantrism is its conception of a phonic plane of existence, parallel to, and even basic to, the objective world. It is a leading factor in cosmic evolution.49 The universe as a system of variously subtle sound elements emanating from the primordial, transcendent sound (njda) is conceived either as a manifestation of Siva alone, or as the result of his union with Sakti."50 Very interesting to the present discussion is that ndda can be sym- bolized by a crescent.51 This motif on the Muktesvara ceiling may, then, have a double meaning, signifying Siva himself, as well as the primordial sound which he produces, either alone or through union with the Goddess. According to the Kirandgama, it is not the mantras proper that initially emanate from primordial sound, but rather, more subtle sound elements, the phonemes. They are represented by the letters of the alphabet, the basic constituents from which first the mantras, and the words of language, arise.52 These phonemes are given the appelation mitrk's (mothers), and in other contexts are mantra-mdtrkis (mothers of the mantras), for it is this limited number of phonemes, analogous to the creative power of Siva, from which 46 Faces within gav/ksa motifs, while often anonymous, frequently bear identifiable iconographical traits. See Thomas Donaldson, "Development of the Vajra-Mastaka on Orissan Temples," East and West 26.3-4 (Sept.-Dec. 1976), figs. 3,5,7,15,z20o. On the vajra-mastka on the north side of the Muktegvara's likhara, the lotus has placed before it an image of Siva dancing. 47 For examples see Rawson, Art of Tantra, figs. 65,78,15 3,154, 156. 48 For illustrations of mandalas composed of mantras see Rawson, ibid., fig. 5o, and Alain Danielou, Hindu Polytheism (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1964), p. 387. 49 Gupta, et al., Hindu Tantrism, p. 93. 50 Ibid., p. 93. 51 Ibid., p. 94, citing the Mahanirvana Tantra. While this text is usually considered to be quite late (17th century), Agehananda Bharati in The Tantric Tradition (London: Rider and Company, 1965), considers it one of the oldest Tantras, dating to the IIth century at the latest (pp. 66, 171). 52 Brunner, "Kiranagama," p. 318, citing patala i . See also Gonda, Medieval Religious Literature, pp. 186-187. 92</page><page sequence="21">all mantras, and finally words, corresponding to the various aspects of phenomenal existence, are created.53 It is through the evolving forms of the basic sound elements, the mdtrkis, that passage is made from the One, the Absolute, to the many, from inexpressible to expressible knowledge. For just as the world is seen to evolve from the pure absolute to the realm of phenomenal existence, so from transcendent sound evolve first the phonemes, then sacred mantras, and finally, words, the human means of expressing knowledge. Thus knowledge, like existence, has a supreme, transcendent source. Two other Tantric works, the Svacchanda Tantra and the Kubjikdmata Tantra describe the phonemes, or mantra-mdtrkas, in a way that seems highly analogous to the Muktesvara ceiling's imagery. In these texts, a group of eight goddesses (the Seven Mothers plus Mahdlaksmi), preside over the eight sections of the alphabet, and are thus identified with the mantra-mitrks,.54 The image of Virabhadra is most likely retained in the Mukte'vara ceiling because of the long-standing convention of representing him with the Mothers. The Kirandgama also describes how the letters of the alphabet (the matrkis) are to be disposed upon a circular mandala. In their ensemble they constitute the "Sakti of the Word" (Vdgisvari-Sakti), who appears personified to the devotee in the course of meditation.55ss If the Absolute is represented by the central lotus and crescent, and its immediate emanations by the Mothers, a third level of existence, the realm of manifestation, is represented by the reliefs surrounding the central mandala - the depictions of Gane'a and Skanda, Parvati's Penance, and the two reliefs depicting music and dance. In a general way, all these scenes represent events occurring on the phenomenal plane, and in their placement, can be read as evolving immediately from the differentiated Mdtrkds, and ultimately from the Absolute. In terms of sound symbolism, however, the Ganesa image and the music and dance scenes can be read as phenomenal manifestations of the primordial ndda. In their representations of musicians clanging cymbals and beating drums, the reliefs depict in a most appropriate way the phenomenal evolute of primordial, unheard sound. The drum is of particular symbolic importance here. It is well known that the drum is a symbol of the creative power of Siva, and that he plays it during his dance of creation.56 Siva dancing in his creative, peaceful (saumya) aspect is prominantly depicted on the likhara of the Muktesvara temple.5s This creative dance is imitated in the interior by Ganesa and the 53 Gupta, et al., Hindu Tantrism, p.

The associations here are subtle and rather ingenious. Not only is manifest sound depicted on the plane of creation; also given visual form is the idea of creation through sound, through both the evolution of ndda, and the beating of Siva's drum. The final textual sources to be considered here not only support an interpretation of the ceiling of the Muktesvara temple as a mandala, but also suggest that the forehall in which it stands was conceived specifically as a meditation hall. A meditation is described in the Kashmiri Militnivijaya Tantra (c. ioth century), where after offering pujaj to Ganesa, the devotee contemplates an image of Siva surrounded by eight goddesses, who can be identified with the Sapta Matrkds.58 Also from the tradition of Kashmir Saivism comes a similar meditation where the object of contemplation, the Absolute and its emanations, is internalized, identified with the very being of the yogin. Here, various gods are to be identified with constituent parts of the individual's psyche. Intellect, ego, mind, and the five senses are connected with a group of eight Mothers, here called indrya devi-s, or goddesses of the senses. They are located in a circular formation in the heart lotus, around the supreme pair, Siva-Sakti. Eight Mothers situated on a mandala surrounding a central figure were apparently the subject of a fairly prominant type of meditation of the Tantric Saivite tradition. It is a reasonable suggestion that the meditations just cited, and perhaps meditations based on the concept of the mantra-mdtrkis, were practiced in the Muktesvara temple, and that the ceiling mandala functioned for devotees as ayantra, or meditative instrument, from which to begin their meditation.5s s8 Pandit Madhusudhan Kaul Shastri, ed., Mdlfnivijayottara Tantram (Srinagar: Research Dept., Jammu and Kashmir State,g922), 8.96. The names of the goddesses here are Indrnin, Agneyl, Nairti, Kauverl, Vdyavi, Yami, IS'ni, Vdrundni. It is interesting that the Vaisnava goddess in the more standard lists of Sapta Mdtrkds (Vdrdh1, Vaisnavi) are omitted in this Tantric Saivite text. s9 Gupta, et al., Hindu Tantrism, p. 59, citing Abhinavagupta's Dehasthadevatd Cakra Stotra (3 ff.), "The indrya devTs (eight Mothers) are located in a circular formation in the heart lotus (anandakonda), around the supreme pair of Ananda- bhairava and his spouse (Anandabhairavi)." The Mothers worship the couple with the objects of the senses as their offerings. A description of the Mothers being worshipped in a mandala or circle is seen also in the Brhat Samhitd (cited by D.C. Sircar, Studies in the Religious Life of Ancient and Medieval India (New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 197I1), p. 99. The text refers to "mdtr-mandala-vidah, or mandala-krama-vidab, those who know fully the circle of the Mothers. The other reading, accepted by Utpala, explains mandala-krama as pujd-krama, i.e., mandala-pujd-krama (traditional rules regarding the worship of the mandala)." There is a Jain text that is also of interest for its descriptions of a mdtrkd- mandala, although its meaning and use are quite different from what we have discussed above. TheJvalini Kalpa, chap. 4 describes a mandala of eight petals, containing images of Brahmani, Mahevari, et al., with an image of a goblin in the center. This diagram is used in "ritual meant to bring about harm to an enemy." See R.N. Nandi, Religious Institutions and Cults in the Deccan (New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, I973), p. 131. The same text again invokes the Mothers in a rite "by which a person is hypnotized and brought under control" (ibid., p. 13I). 94</page><page sequence="23">Conclusion The textual analogies made with the ceiling of the Muktesvara temple show that a cohesive group of ideas, prevalent at the time of its production, certainly played a role in the formation of its iconography, and help us to understand its deeper meanings. On one level the Muktesvara ceiling has a simple iconic-narrative function, depicting a group of interrelated deities. On another level, it depicts a complex conception of the Absolute and its emanations, which can be interpreted as both tangible and objective (celestial phenomenon), and subtle and mystical (the mantra-mdtrkas), the essential substance of all that has potential for existence. Finally, the ceiling perhaps served very specifically as a mandala or vantra, as an aid to spiritual practice, helping the devotee to visualize some of the abstract ideas which bore specifically upon his meditation.
