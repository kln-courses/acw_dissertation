<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XL, No. 4 OCTOBER, 1930 THE MONIST THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE1 WE are all aware that in recent times new views have become current concerning the aim and the func tions of Natural Science. We used to think that its aim was to explain. But for some time past superior persons have been assuring us that this was a complete mistake. The question which Science answers, they tell us, is not why? but how? Its aim is not at all to explain, but merely to describe. Now if the issue here raised were, so to say, simply a domestic one, if it were just a private quarrel among the scientists themselves concerning the aims and the methods of their study, it would ill become a mere philosopher to take part in the dispute or even to offer any comments upon it. But unfortunately, although the Descriptive Theory began by concerning itself mainly with the details of scientific methodology, in these days it seems to have enlarged its scope, and has come to be a theory of the constitution of the external world itself. And whereas it began by being an obscure heresy it is now or soon will be the orthodox view : and with the whole prestige of Science to back it, will be thrust upon the layman in a thousand forms in every monthly magazine and every other evening newspaper. Thus philosophers, however ignorant of Sci ence, have no longer the right to ignore this theory. For 1 A paper read to the Moral Science Club, Cambridge, England.</page><page sequence="2">486 THE MONIST it is entering, or has entered, upon the territory of Philos ophy itself. Yet although this theory is "very much in the air" at the present time, one has some difficulty in saying exactly what it is. Those who expound it in print seem to fall chiefly into two classes. Either they have been scientific writers like Mach and Karl Pearson, whose main interest is the study of scientific method, and whose philosophical views are stated mainly in 'asides' and intended perhaps rather to shock than to convince : or they have been popu larisers (I do not use the word in an invidious sense) try ing to make the latest discoveries of Science accessible to the layman, and although it is obvious enough that they have pretty definite philosophical views, those views are rather insinuated than expounded or argued for. The most important exception known to me is Signor Croce, who in his Logica (Part II chapters 5 and 6) seems to adopt the Descriptive Theory, though not under that name. But his account of it, though brilliantly written, is so brief and at the same time so metaphorical that I am not sure whether I have understood it at all. Nor can I quite make out how far another distinguished idealist writer, Mr. R. G. Collingwood, intends to adopt the theory. It seems to me that the conception of Science expounded by him in Speculum Mentis (ch. 5) is a kind of cross between the Descriptive Theory and the Pragmatist Theory. But in any case it is worth noticing that in his opinion the move ment of which that view is the result is "by far the most important intellectual movement of the last half-century'' (p. 181). What is clear enough is that all these writers want us to change our opinions concerning the external world in some very radical way, but in exactly what way, remains</page><page sequence="3">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 487 rather obscure. We can only gather certain hints. And in the first place, the Descriptive Theory, it seems, has abolished a number of things which most people believe in ; its first triumph, we gather, was to do away with the no tion of Force. But latterly, it seems, even Causation is un safe : we hear it said that the word 'cause' has no place in Science, and consequently the old notion of a Law of Na ture has somehow to be altered. And Substance of course has long ago been dropped. Secondly, we gather that the Descriptive Theory, if it does not put Realism entirely out of court (meaning by Realism the doctrine that a world which can be called 'physical' in some not-too-Pickwickian sense exists inde pendent of consciousness) at any rate makes Realism very much more improbable than it used to be, and makes some form of Idealism very much more probable. Thus, Mr. J. B. S. Haldane tells us in Daedalus that a Kantian period is upon us, and there are signs that Solipsism is becoming popular among distinguished physicists. Thirdly, if Realism is much less probable, a fortiori the old-fashioned Materialism of the last century is less prob able still. And it follows from this, we hear, that there is no longer any conflict between Science and Religion, or again between Science and the aesthetic consciousness, (cf. Mr. J. W. N. Sullivan's writings.) Fourthly, many people seem to hold that the proposi tions of Science are neither true nor false, but only con venient or inconvenient?that is, that they are not propo sitions at all, but (I suppose) imperatives, like the recipes in a cookery book. It seems very doubtful whether this doctrine can be reconciled with the Descriptive Theory: yet the same people, I think, sometimes hold both. Ob viously, it goes a long way with the Pragmatists: but as</page><page sequence="4">488 THE MONIST Mr. Collingwood points out, it is not strictly speaking Pragmatism. It does not hold that 'true' means the same as 'convenient.' It is not committed to any particular theory as to the meaning of the term 'true/ and could quite well hold that this term is indefinable. Nor does it say that no propositions are either true or false (in which case it would of course be self-refuting) : but only that the so called propositions of Science (e.g., those that profess to state Natural Laws) are neither true nor false, because they are not really propositions. The propositions of Philosophy, on the other hand, and according to Croce those of History also, really are propositions, and are therefore either true or false, according to the theory. Lastly, the Theory of Relativity appears to have given a new impulse to the Descriptive view. Mr. Russell says somewhere that it has shaken the traditional doctrine of substance more than all the arguments of the philosophers. Some people indeed seem to think that the Descriptive view (with all the implications that I have cited) has been definitely established by the Theory of Relativity, or at least that nobody can consistently accept the one and reject the other. Other authorities deny these propositions : and it seems probable that they are right, for it would be very odd if a scientific hypothesis, however far-reaching, could establish or refute a philosophical theory concerning the external world and the nature of our consciousness of it? and that is what the Descriptive Theory really is. But however this may be, it is I believe true that many relativ ists are also descriptivists, and there seem to be grounds for thinking (I speak with diffidence as a layman) that the Theory of Relativity is more easily expounded in terms of the descriptivist philosophy than in terms of a more ordi nary realistic philosophy, though it is compatible with</page><page sequence="5">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 489 either. It is therefore psychologically natural, though not logically necessary, that the Descriptive Theory should have strengthened its hold both upon the scientific and the lay mind ever since the Relativity Theory came to be gen erally accepted. These then, or something like them, are the views about Nature which the Descriptive Theory asks us to accept. In some ways they are attractive. The conflict between Science and Religion has troubled mankind for two cen turies at least : and there have been lesser conflicts between Science and the moral consciousness and perhaps between Science and the aesthetic consciousness. Everybody would like to see these conflicts abolished. Mankind would then have some chance of becoming really civilised. But is not the price too great? Are we prepared to give up the categories of substance and cause, and to surrender the independent reality of the external world? Are we pre pared to give up the hope of explaining the changes that we perceive and content ourselves with describing them? (If scientific investigators cannot explain them, it is pretty certain that nobody else can. ) And perhaps the statement that Science is neither true nor false but only convenient is the most shocking of all. If we are to make up our minds concerning these doc trines, we must obviously begin by asking whether they really do follow from the Descriptive Theory. Perhaps some of them do, and others do not. We must therefore enter upon a philosophical examination of the theory, and we must examine it (I repeat this in order that there may be no misunderstanding) not in so far as it is a theory of scientific method, for that is not our business ; but in so far as it is a philosophy, i.e., a theory of Nature and of our consciousness of Nature.</page><page sequence="6">490 THE MONIST Clearly we must begin by asking two questions: 1. What is it that is described? 2. What does 'describing' here mean? It is fairly obvious what answer the descriptivist would give to our first question. He would say that the entities which science describes are 'phenomena' or 'sensations' or possibly 'perceptions.' These words are notoriously am biguous. But it is pretty clear that they here mean sense data or percepts, not sensings or perceivings. No doubt some descriptivists have accepted Idealism simply because they failed to see this ambiguity. But, as we shall see later, they have better arguments for Idealism than this one, and their theory can perfectly well be stated in terms of sense data or percepts. Indeed I think that most descriptivists would be quite content to say that the task of science is to describe events: and in this word there is no reference to the consciousness of sentient beings. The second question "what does 'describing' mean?" is much more difficult. To describe an entity is presumably to recognize it to be an instance1* of some universal or con cept: and to express one's recognition in a proposition. The subject of the proposition will always be a singular term.2 But I do not think it need be a concrete term : for instance it is a description of honesty to say that it is the best policy. It might be held that the predicate must al ways have the definite or indefinite article prefixed: thus Trinity College is the largest college in Cambridge would be called a description of Trinity College. But Trinity College is large would not. It is not clear to me that this view would be correct. It seems to me that to assign any la This universal may cover the whole being of the entity, as when I say this is a cat : or it may cover only an element in its being, as when I say this is black, or this is on the floor. (The distinction is Cook Wilson's.) 2 It might itself be a description : e.g., The man on the left of the fireplace is the Professor of Latin.</page><page sequence="7">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 491 characteristic to an entity is so far to describe it, though of course the description need not be either sufficient or complete. The simplest and most fundamental descriptions are those in which the subject is a demonstrative pronoun: e.g. this is a cow, that is the Professor of Latin. But as these two examples show, not all descriptions, even of this fundamental kind, can be called scientific. No one would say that it is the business of Science to utter such state ments as This is a cow. And if it be said that these things (the cow and the Professor) are not sense-data, nor events, we may change our example: would anyone say that this is a noise or that is a lightning-flash were the kind of statements which Science aims at making ? Clearly not. When Science makes such statements, it does so merely as a means. It does not think that its aim has been achieved when it has made no matter how many of them. Yet they are certainly descriptions, and descriptions of sense-data, or of events, or (if the word is too dear to be abandoned) of 'phenomena.' It is more plausible to say that the descriptions which Science seeks to give are simple or general: i.e., that it seeks to describe not one event at a time, but whole groups of events at once. And this is what descriptivist writers usually say: some of them illustrate or perhaps obscure their meaning by comparing Science with shorthand. Thus Croce says "the natural sciences and the empirical concepts which compose them arise as a shorthand transcription of the living and changeable reality" (Logica, Part 2, Ch. 5, p. 224). And it may well be said that All matter gravi tates or Salt is soluble in water really are 'simple' descrip tions in the sense that each of them describes a multitude of events at once; and that if we could find a single state ment that described at one blow all the events that there</page><page sequence="8">492 THE MONIST have been, are or will be, the ultimate simplification would have been accomplished, and the final goal of Science reached. (I do not think it is necessary to distinguish 'simple' from 'general.' If descriptivists usually prefer the term 'simple' or sometimes 'brief,' this is probably due to the conceptualist bias which many of them are afflicted with?a bias which we may discount for the moment, since it does not seem essential to their theory. ) Still 'simple' by itself is clearly insufficient. The state ment that 'Nature is what is known by the senses' is a description of Nature, and a very simple or very general one. But nobody would say that it was a scientific state ment. It is obviously philosophical, not scientific. Science is not content with anything so formal as this. The de scription at which it aims must somehow comprehend within itself the specific detail of Nature: whereas the statement Nature is zvhat is known by the senses might still have been true even if the observed detail of Nature had been quite different from what it in fact is. It is a description of all possible 'Natures' : whereas Science wants to give a description of this particular Nature which now is, and in which we live and move. If we put in the word 'comprehensive' this point is made clear. For compre hensive and formal are obviously opposed. The proper ex pression of the theory therefore is: what Science aims at is a description of sense-data or of events which is as simple and comprehensive as possible. But even so we are not out of the wood. Imagine that we could take a view of all the events which have hap pened, are happening, and will happen. Is it not obvious that there are many different ways in which they could be simply-and-comprehensively described? For instance, we might take an arbitrary event say that which is happening</page><page sequence="9">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 493 in the middle of this page at 8 p. m., g. m. t., on May 24th 1929: and we might describe all events past, present and future by stating their spatio-temporal relations to this. This description would be comprehensive in that it would take account of specific differences between events, and would not confine itself merely to those formal (or so to say metaphysical) characteristics which they all have in common. And it would be susceptible of 'simplification/ For space-time could be parcelled out into regions, and all the events that occurred in region No. 1 could be grouped together and so could all the events that occurred in region No. 2, and so on : and these regions could then be grouped into larger regions. But such a description, if we could make it, would not be Science in the sense in which Physics or Biology are sciences. What we should have constructed genera. But this again, whatever it is, is not Science. Or again we might describe all these events by refer ence to their sensible qualities. And the sensible qualities could be grouped under a small number of heads?colour, sound, thermal quality, etc.?each having its species and sub-species: this would enable us to simplify our descrip tion. But this classification of events in terms of their sensible qualities, though it would be a simple and compre hensive describing of them, obviously would not be Science. Again we might, I suppose, use as our fundamentum descriptionis the emotions aroused by these events in actual or possible observers : some of the events would be disgust ing, others alarming, others merely boring, and so on. And here also our description could be simplified by group ing these characteristics as species under a small number of genera. But this again, whatever it is, is not science. From these examples it is plain that our statement of the Descriptive Theory is not yet satisfactory. It is not enough to say that the aim of Science is to describe events</page><page sequence="10">494 THE MONIST as simply and comprehensively as possible. It is necessary to specify in terms of what kind of characteristics the de scribing is to be done, i.e., to state what we called just now the fundamentum descriptionis. At first sight it seems easy to do this. Why not say 'to give as simple and comprehensive a description as pos sible in terms of cause and effect' ? But of course this will not do. For the Descriptive Theory eschews the notion of cause and effect: notoriously, it maintains that they are mere relics of primitive anthropomorphism and have no place in Science. And it professes to provide an alternative to the ordinary cause-and-effect theory of Science : indeed to provide one is perhaps its main business. So we must restate the fundamentum descriptionis and say : the Descriptive Theory holds that the aim of Science is to describe events as simply and comprehensively as possible in terms of regular sequence. And with this, we may hope we have at least reached a satisfactory notion of the sort of describing that is meant. If we are right, the theory will have to distinguish three main stages in any scientific inquiry. The first stage is that of judgments of perception. Here we take the observed events, and we recognize that each such event has certain characteristics, or is a certain type or kind of event, e.g., This is an explo sion, this is the fall of an apple, that is a lightning flash, this is the taking of Prussic acid by an Englishman, and so on. (The scientific advocates of the Descriptive Theory do not usually notice this stage, I think. Or if they do, they do not see what difficulties it raises. Their theories of perception are in general very naive. Usually they are either crude sensationalists or what I may call physiological solipsists. )</page><page sequence="11">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 495 The second stage is as follows: (a) As a result of the first stage, we have now before us a vast multitude of events, each having a certain character or having certain qualities; (b) we now notice that the number of characters is a good deal smaller than the number of events, i.e., that every event resembles many others in many respects? there are many explosions, and many Englishmen take Prussic acid; and thus we group events into classes; (c) we find that each class of events has members at several or many different dates and places; (d) we now seek for each kind or class of event a determinate kind or class of constant antecedents. (This is the step expounded by Mill in his chapters on the Inductive Methods.) This process of finding is guided by no insight into or intuitive aware ness of "necessary connexions/' So far as we know, (ac cording to the Descriptive Theory) there are no such con nexions, in Nature at least. We simply examine a number of cases in which E occurs: we find that in each case A precedes it at the same determinate interval, whereas its other antecedents vary from case to case: and we find that when A is removed (all else remaining the same) E is removed also. We conclude that events of the E kind are constantly preceded by events of the A kind, at a certain determinate interval of time (whether zero or not). The third stage: we have now portioned out the events with which we started into a number of types of sequence or process, in each of which an event of one kind constantly follows upon an event of some other determinate kind. In the third stage, we classify those types of se quence, as species, under a smaller number of generic types of sequence : e.g. fallings of apples to the earth, ris ings of the tide when the moon's position changes, and movements of the planets round the earth, are all cases of gravitational attraction. (In this particular case the man</page><page sequence="12">496 THE MONIST ner of 'specification/ or specific differentiation of species within the genus, will be quantitative. Bodies of such and such a mass and at such and such a distance will attract each other to such and such a degree.) Or again the changes undergone by races of animals in captivity and by races of wild animals may both be brought under the genus 'selective process'?the one artificially selective and the other naturally. If possible, the generic types of se quence so found are to be classified again as species under a smaller number of higher genera. And so we arrive, by these three stages, at a simple and comprehensive classification of the constant sequences of observed events. First come the judgments of perceptions. Then the finding of constant sequences of perceived events. Then the classifying of these sequences (as specific differ entiations) under a small number of genera or general types of sequence. Now if this is the Descriptive Theory of Science, there are certain obvious comments which we may make upon it. 1. It seems to be nothing new, but to be simply the old Uniformity Theory of Mill and others. Mill and other empiricists would say that the business of Science is to discover uniformities of sequence and concomitance in the events which we observe. It is true that they talk about 'explanation/ and explanation might seem to differ from description: we might think that to explain meant to an swer the question 'why?' which the Descriptive Theory forbids us to do. But when Mill speaks of explanation he clearly does not mean this. His three types of explanation, ?by resolution into parts, by intermediate links and by subsumption?are simply ways of answering the question 'how?' and the first two reduce in the end to subsumption, which appears not to differ from what the Descriptive Theory calls 'simplification/</page><page sequence="13">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 497 2. A more fundamental criticism is that the descrip tivist forgets how extremely fragmentary our observations are.3 Most of the sequences in whose constancy we firmly believe have never been observed from beginning to end: in most cases, perhaps in all, we observe only a bit of each sequence and 'fill in' the rest. For example, bodies near the earth fall when their supports are removed. But we often observe them falling when we have not observed the removal of their supports: for instance a tile falls on our head, though we never saw it dislodged from the roof. Again we often observe removal of supports without ob serving the alleged constant consequence of this: for instance if I drop a pencil out of my window on a dark night, I do not see it falling. If we stick strictly to the events which we actually perceive, adding nothing, we shall find that we have evidence for very few constant sequences indeed, perhaps for none at all. Not only the limited range of our sensitive faculties, but interruptions in their working, e.g., by blinking, fits of inattention or of attention to something else, periods of non-perceptual consciousness, e.g., dreaming, and of purely conceptual thinking, and perhaps periods of complete unconsciousness, e.g., in dreamless sleep?all these must be taken into ac count. Nor may we appeal to testimony, since this would land us in a vicious circle. For if we did, we should be presupposing the constancy of a sequence, the antecedent in which has not been and presumably cannot be observed : we shall be assuming that the occurrence of certain noises or the coming into being of certain black marks on paper constantly follow upon acts of knowing, believing, and the like. Thus if we stick strictly to the perceived we find not a simply and comprehensively describable world, but a 3 This criticism applies equally to Mill.</page><page sequence="14">498 THE MONIST chaos of undescribable fragments. This obvious fact is concealed from the descriptivists and from Mill because they tacitly suppose themselves to be describing the sense data of a sort of omnipercipient observer, whose senses suffer from no limits and who can occupy all points of view at once. We all believe that if there were such an observer, the entities which he observed would be simply and compre hensively describable. But no one of us, not even Mach, is omnipercipient; and our notion of the experience which an omnipercipient observer would enjoy is formed by the most bare-faced extrapolation from the miserably frag mentary data which alone are perceived by each of us. It follows that the proposition 'What we observe forms part of a simply and comprehensively describable order of Nature' is one which observation not only cannot prove, but cannot even support?just as on the ordinary non descriptivist theory the Law of Universal Causation can not be proved or even supported by observation. A. a this I think is rather a shock to the Descriptive Theory : a strict empiricist is not really entitled to hold it ? yet many (though not all) of its advocates profess to be strict em piricists, and to have adopted the theory for that very reason. We must also object to the doctrine of Croce that the business of the physical sciences is to make an index to History (i.e., I suppose, to the perceived). This I think is just a metaphorical way of putting the Descriptive Theory. The objection to it is : before you can make this index you must forget the greater part of your text. For observa tion or history only gives you the most meagre fragments, and if you stick to them alone, you will have nothing to make an index to. 3. What about prediction? How can we describe what has not happened yet? It is very odd that advocates of the</page><page sequence="15">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 499 Descriptive Theory stress the practical utility of Science so much. For its practical utility disappears entirely if you cannot describe what has not happened yet. And what an extraordinary kind of description that is ! What we may call post-diction?i.e., discovering what must have happened in the unobserved past, as geology for instance does, or in deed discovering what must have happened before I was born or before I came into the room?raises just the same difficulty. (We may add, for the benefit of the Croceans, that all historical research which uses documents or in scriptions raises it too. ) Or in terms of Croce's own meta phor, by what right do we make an index to those parts of the book which we haven't read yet, and to those which we cannot possibly read? It seems to me that both these objections (Nos. 2 and 3) can be met only in one way?by the use of what Kant calls a Transcendental Argument. No. 2 might be met as follows : If what I observe can not be thought of as part of a simply and comprehensibly describable order of Nature, my unity and identity as a self conscious thinking being cannot be preserved. Therefore whatever / observe, so long as I remain myself, must be capable of being so thought of. Thus in terms of Croce's metaphor I am entitled to forge the greater part of my text, adding enormously to the few fragments which alone are given to observation. For the knowledge "that the text is indexable" is in a manner prior to the reading of the text itself. And what seems like wanton 'cookery' is really a necessary precondition of self-conscious experiencing. No. 3 is met similarly. If what I observe now and what I shall observe in the future cannot be thought of as parts of the same simply describable order of Nature, I shall not be the same self-conscious thinking being in the future as I am now. Therefore whatever I observe, so</page><page sequence="16">500 THE MONIST long as I remain myself, must not only be describable, but describable in the same manner as what I observe now. (Analogously for post-diction.) If these two transcendental arguments were admitted, the Descriptive Theory (thus supplemented) would I think be perfectly tenable. But we should have to say that al though the business of the scientific investigator in his scientific capacity was just to describe events as simply and comprehensively as possible : yet in his capacity of intelli gent being or self-conscious subject he would do far more than describe ; by the process which Kant not very happily calls synthesis, he would pass beyond the meagre and cha otic data of sense, and would construct or rather con structively discover the very entities which as scientist he subsequently describes. If on the other hand all transcendental arguments are rejected, this rejection clearly affects all theories of Science, not merely the Descriptive Theory. For they all have to assume the truth of some axiom or axioms which do not seem self-evident; and if those axioms cannot be proved by transcendental argument, there seems no way of prov ing them at all. The descriptivist is only at a disadvantage in this, that he ususally professes that his theory is em pirical in a sense in which other theories are not?a claim which, as we have seen, cannot be admitted for a moment. So much by way of exposition of the Descriptive Theory. We must now try to say something about its wider philosophical implications. And first, it is thought in some quarters that the theory has succeeded in explod ing the notions of substance and of causation. I cannot see the slightest ground for this. The most it could claim to have shewn is that Science has no need of these notions. But scientific cognition is not the only mode of cognition : and what Science studies is not the whole of the real And</page><page sequence="17">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE SOI indeed it may be said, this is just the point which the Descriptive Theory (as contrasted with previous theories) has made perfectly clear. It might be the case that in our ordinary perception of the external world (though not in our scientific describing of it) we constantly apply those categories, or apprehend those categorical factors ; as indeed we obviously do. Further, if we did not, the Descriptive Theory would have nothing to describe. What it describes are events: and whatever account we may give of sub stance, and under whatever other names we may introduce it,4 it seems to me perfectly clear that there can be no events without substances to or in which they happen. And not only cannot events be without substances; it is even more clear that they cannot be apprehended as events ex cept we also apprehend the substances to or in which they happen. Moreover, in order to be conscious of the per sistent identity of a substance which endures through time, we must I think apprehend relations of immanent causality subsisting between the events which make up its history. (Whether a substance can have identity in the absence of such immanent causality I do not know.) And it seems impossible to draw any line between immanent causality and transeunt causality, since a single substance may con sist of substances, and the transeunt action of these sub stances upon one another may be essential to the very ex istence and therefore to the persistence through time of the whole which they together make up. (Any machine or any organism will do as an illustration.) We may also bring certain arguments ad homines against those descriptivists who think they have removed substance and causality not only from Science, but from Reality itself. In the first place they themselves must allow that there are what we may call descriptive correlations 4 For instance under the name "long event."</page><page sequence="18">502 THE MONIST between events. And these correlations will be in at least two 'dimensions'?simultaneous and successive. A set of simultaneous and successive events united into one describ able whole by such correlations looks uncommonly like what most people would call a substance?especially when we remember, as we must, that the correlata, the 'events' of which the describable whole is formed, are really only abstractions from a continuous process. And the descrip tive correlation which binds them into one whole looks un commonly like immanent causality. A similar argument could be brought with regard to transeunt causality. But to this the descriptivist may answer that the only sort of substance he is abolishing is the old-fashioned sub stratum?the something we know not what which stands over against or behind qualities, relations and events, and is entirely inaccessible to observation. And he may add that the only sort of causality he is abolishing is the active or anthropomorphic sort. Now I shall waste no tears on the 'something we know not what' of Locke. It seems to me that the identity of a substance through the diversity of its qualities and relations, and its identical persistence through time, can be otherwise provided for?though even then, it is by no means clear to me that change (to say nothing of individuation ) can be adequately expounded without the use of some conception analogous to the matter of the Schoolmen, Aristotle's : and I think I can see this turning up in modern philosophy under other and to my mind less suitable names, e.g., under the name of Space-Time. But if we let go the Lockean substance, we cannot so easily surrender activity. And here we may use an ad hominem argument, somewhat similar to a celebrated argument of Mr. W. E. Johnson against the Naturalists.5 ? Logic, Vol. III.</page><page sequence="19">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 503 Descriptivists warn us that our ordinary notions of caus ality are anthropomorphic. According to them, we ordi narily believe that the earth, pulls at the moon with an effort, as we tug at a recalcitrant kite. And that belief they consider to be a mistake. The earth, they assure us, does not really make efforts, and it enjoys no organic sensations. And they seem to regard it as their chief business in life to repeat these solemn platitudes ad nau seam. But when these same authors come as they some times do to dabble in Psychology, we find that they try to abolish activity in men also, just as they abolished it in the external world. They reduce the human mind with Hume to a series of sensations and images, and we discover to our astonishment that there is no 'we/ and that if there were, we could not conceivably do anything. But if this is so, what becomes of the charge of an thropomorphism? If we do not ourselves experience ac tivity, how can we possibly make the mistake of 'project ing' it into external objects? Not only would the mistake not occur, it would not even be conceivable. I cannot mis takenly identify A with unless I have got the conception of B. And how am I to get it, except by apprehending instances of it ? A similar reply may be made to the charge of animism which is sometimes brought against those who accept the category of substance. How can I 'project' the unity of my own ego into the external world if I am not conscious of the unity of my own ego, and how can I be that, if my ego is not a unity at all, but a mere series of sensations and images? But to leave ad hominem arguments, is it not obvious that we are in some sense conscious of our own activity, i.e., of doing things? I should have thought that there was nothing more certain than this. Thus in our own case, if in no other, the activity view of causation seems to apply.</page><page sequence="20">504 THE MONIST But if this is so, I venture to suggest that we can go further. We cannot act without acting upon something. And in acting upon a thing, e.g., in bending a stick, are we not eo ipso conscious if not of counter-action on the thing's part, at any rate of something very like it? I do not see how to argue the matter. The consciousness of activity in ourselves, and of this quasi-action in the things which we act upon, is either an absolutely fundamental datum, which Philosophy must just accept as an ultimate, or it is a mere delusion. I can only appeal to every man's reflection : and let him reflect (if I may say so) not when he is in the study, or even when he is playing backgammon with his friends, but when he is swimming, or climbing a mountain, or digging a hole in the garden. This quasi-action of external objects differs from our own action in being non-teleological in many cases.6 It is rather obsistence than action. But whatever it is, that it is something, and that it is more like activity than mere se quence (however simply describable) seems to me so cer tain and obvious that arguments against it must be wrong somewhere. And if things exercise this quasi-action upon us, we may fairly believe that they exercise it on one another; and if so, the uniformity theory of causation will not stand as a complete account. There is one more question which is so important that we must say something about it. In what sense, if any, is the descriptivist committed to an idealistic theory of knowledge ? As we noticed earlier it seems to be thought that once we adopt this view of Science and of natural laws (laws are only descriptions of how things happen'), such philo sophical doctrines as Materialism, and indeed all forms of 'Naturalistic' doctrine, are very much weakened. The 6 When it does display teleology, we say that the object is either itself alive, or produced by what is alive.</page><page sequence="21">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 505 question is, why is this thought to be so? It is true that the strength of Naturalism, as of sin, is the law. But then the laws of nature are not in any way abolished by the Descriptive Theory: it is true that their 'necessary' character (if they were ever alleged to have it) is done away with, in a sense. It is not necessary that every A should be followed by a B, and every preceded by an A : it just happens to be so. But if the Kantian arguments above expounded are valid, it is necessary that every should be preceded by some one and the same determinate kind of event. It is true that the word law is avoided by the Descriptive Theory, perhaps wisely: yet its old mean ing, or something very like it, is retained. And Science can still make just the same predictions on the Descriptive Theory as it could on the old theory. How then is Natur alism weakened? Is it that the word 'description' lays more stress on the activity of the mind than the word 'law' did? A descrip tion is something that the thinker makes or creates ; but a law is something that just is, whether anyone thinks of it or not. Thus we arrive at a subjectivist or idealist view of Science: matter, for instance, (we are told) is not any thing real?it is just our way of describing sensations? and the material world is just the totality of scientifically described sensations, actual and possible. But why accept this view? It will only recommend itself to Nominalists, and Nominalism is false, since it cannot even state itself without giving up Nominalism?still less can it argue in favour of itself. But if we reject Nominalism, and hold that to describe something is not merely to utter noises, but to express in words the char acters which entities are apprehended by us to possess? then the Descriptive Theory gives no support whatever to subjectivist theories of knowledge. Science will be the</page><page sequence="22">506 THE MONIST description of uniformities really existing in the world, or of relations of non-separation really subsisting between events; and those uniformities will really be the specific differentiations of those generic types of uniformity under which Science classifies them. Both description and classi fication then are modes of apprehending what really is, or of expressing such apprehension in language. Whether the previous (and non-scientific) acts of categorial syn thesis by which we 'refer' our fragmentary sense-data to an ordered system of Nature be a support to Idealism we need not discuss.7 For any theory of Science, and not the Descriptive Theory only, must presuppose those syntheses. But it will be said, what about the Denk?konomie of Mach (whom Croce follows) ? The descriptions that Science gives are not mere flatus vocis: but neither, we shall be told, are they apprehensions of real relations of constant sequence and of species to genera: they are de vices to save us trouble. But we must ask, what kind of trouble do they save? Is it the trouble of thinking that they save (as Mach expressly says in one place, and as the term Denk?konpmie strongly suggests), i.e., I suppose the trouble of thinking of each event after another, one by one? But wouldn't it be less trouble not to think at all? And if you are going to think, the only labour-saving de vice that is any good is one that will help you to apprehend that which really is ; the only genuine thought-economy is the apprehension of real universals and real relations. To pretend they are there when they are not will not help you to know the real, and is therefore no economy at all. Or is it that the descriptions given by Science save us trouble in acting? Certainly they do. But they would not save any trouble at all unless they were cum fundamento in re. Mere fictions and fairy tales do not assist us to act more 7 For my own part, I do not think that it is.</page><page sequence="23">THE DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF SCIENCE 507 successfully. But apprehension of the real does, because it is the real that we have to act in and upon. And if it be said "surely Science uses fictions (e.g., the idea of a perfect gas) and 'mechanical models' (e.g., of the atom as a sort of solar system) and mathematical devices of which no rational account can be given"?if this is said, we answer by asking 1. Why does Science do this? 2. Is it describing when it does this, and if not, what is the good of mention ing these questionable procedures? Of course the truth is that these are not part of the description itself, but means to it. And the veracity of the description is not affected by this, any more than it is by the fact that the scientific man's microscope was paid for by a fictitious cheque. There seems to be only one way left in which the de scriptive theory of science could be held to have weakened naturalistic doctrines. We have referred to the point be fore in another connection. If we hold that the business of Science is just to describe the course of Nature, we shall be led to reflect that the same entity can often be described in many different ways, all equally correct and legitimate. What can be described in one way upon one fundamentum descriptionis, e.g., by the classification of regular se quences, can equally properly be described upon another, e.g., in an aesthetic or historical or geographical way. Now perhaps naturalistic philosophers have thought and still think that Science is the one and only way of appre hending Nature. And certainly the habit of speaking of scientific propositions as the laws of Nature may have en couraged them in this opinion. Or to put the same point rather differently, perhaps they have not always realised that the proposition "Science is the discovery of the laws of Nature" is in one sense just a tautology, since Nature in one sense just means that whose laws Science discovers. If we adopt this language we must say that the naturalists</page><page sequence="24">508 the monist believe that Nature is the whole of the Real, and that this is a mere prejudice since (1) that which is Nature may also be something else (e.g., it may be a beautiful spec tacle, or an object of religious awe) ; (2) there may be and there are other realities besides this one which is Nature (e.g., minds). And it might be held that the Descriptive Theory of Science helped to dispel this prejudice. If this were all, the Descriptive Theory would perform a certain service to anti-naturalistic philosophers, but not a very important or a very new one. But it seems plain that those who advocate the theory consider that its services in these other respects are very important indeed. And it is very desirable that they should (if the phrase may now be allowed) explain why they think so. H. H. Price. Trinity College, Oxford, England.</page></plain_text>
