<plain_text><page sequence="1">Positive Psychology for Animals Mental Health and Well-Being in Animals Edited by Franklin D. McMillan. Ames, Iowa: Blackwell, 2005. 301 pp. Cloth, $89.99. The revolutionary work of Donald Griffin (e.g., 1976) returned long-dormant is sues of higher mental processes to the scientific study of animal behavior. Although many students of animal cognition believe that Griffin went too far, he changed the field by moving it in his direction and stimulated a wealth of research. Along with attributions of mental processes have come increased attributions of emotional states in nonhuman animals. These changes have affected not only the topics of research but also the way in which we think about nonhuman animals and how they should be treated. Most people, be they scientists, pet owners, or others interacting with animals, care about the well-being of their animals. Nonhuman animals are regarded as</page><page sequence="2">166 AVERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY, Spring 2007 worthy of moral concern. Animals should be kept in good physical health. Fur thermore, most people seek to provide conditions that minimize pain and distress. Recently, however, this concern has moved beyond issues of pain and distress to sensitivity to the psychological well-being of animals. This effort received impetus from the Federal Animal Welfare Act, which required enrichment to enhance the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates and provide exercise for dogs. Also in recent years there has been a movement in psychology toward a positive psychology, a view that absence of pathology is only a start toward mental health, which is to be followed by study of means of enhancing feelings of well-being, happiness, and satisfaction in humans. As an outgrowth of these various shifts in emphasis, it is perhaps not surprising that there have been greater efforts to apply this perspective to the psychological well-being of other species. This approach provides the rationale for the present volume. To quote editor Franklin D. McMillan, "one of the principal objectives of this book is to present a balanced view of mental health so that at the very outset, the positive psychologi cal states-those that have the potential for enhancing the life experience-will be placed on an equal level of importance as the negative states" (pp. xi-xii). McMillan has assembled a volume of 21 chapters by some leading authors in this developing field. It is divided into four sections: I, "Foundations of Animal Mental Health and Well-Being"; II, "Emotional Distress, Suffering, and Mental Illness"; III, "Mental Wellness"; and IV, "Special Populations." All of the authors suggest that their approach to animals will be effective in improving the well-being and mental health of animals. However, the approaches range from the hard headed scientific attitude to soft, holistic perspectives. Therefore, the chapters are inevitably uneven. The problem may be to harness the holistic concern with the down-to-earth procedures that can realistically improve the well-being of nonhu man animals. Some books are the result of discussions occurring at meetings where ideas can be exchanged, difficult concepts discussed, and perspectives explored. In some books, the interactions between the authors are reprinted or summarized. This can lead to consistency of terminology and understanding. By contrast, this book includes chapters written independently. Chapters simply follow one after the other. The result is excessive redundancy as each author addresses fundamental issues of definition and approach in apparent ignorance of the writings of other authors. Furthermore, there is no concluding chapter; rather, the volume ends with a chapter on the care and treatment of psittacine birds (by Lynne Seibert). Lacking both a concluding chapter and section introductions, the book lacks coherent integration. In addition, it could have profited from closer editing and proofreading. Again and again, the authors discuss the problems of defining such terms as emotions, pleasure, suffering, feelings, boredom, distress, stress, mental illness, quality of life, well-being, mental health, and happiness in animals. In many chapters, an author delineates the application of a term in human psychology and speculates about its applicability to nonhuman animals. The utility of these distinctions is not always clear. Indeed, at one point, after writing separate chapters on quality of life and happiness, McMillan concedes that "at present, no consensus exists as to how, or</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 167 even if, happiness differs from quality of life in humans" (p. 231). Most psychologists appear to believe intuitively that nonhuman animals have mental states and experience emotions. It is hard to observe a dog that has just stepped on a nail, a primate that appears frustrated, or even a rat that has been shocked and not believe that the animal experiences something that, to at least some degree, resembles our own experiences. (For now, I bypass the problem of making such inferences in other humans.) However, when one tries to distinguish between such states and to make solid inferences about them in a scientific, rather than intuitive context, the problems become very difficult, if not insurmount able. Adoption of many of the pragmatic perspectives presented in this volume might have heuristic value. Adoption of a variation on Daniel Dennett's (1987) inten tional stance or Gordon Burghardt's (1988) critical anthropomorphism can enable scientists to conduct interesting research that might not have been conducted otherwise. This approach has been effective in facilitating research on animal cognition and should be effective with the present set of problems. However, most of the authors in this book adopt an approach of realism in arguing that these states do exist and can be dealt with scientifically. Many of the approaches in the volume could profit from some evolutionary thinking. Most authors fail to recognize the distinction between ultimate and proximate causes of behavior, focusing entirely on the latter. For example, McMil lan seems puzzled as to why animals seek dominant status in groups. Finding no immediate reward for challenges of the dominant individuals, he suggests that "the only recognizable reward is a better life, implying at a minimum, ajudgement of dissatisfaction with one's current life" (p. 230). The possibility that the animal may have evolved mechanisms that lead it to challenge dominant individuals because individuals displaying such a trait may have left more viable, fertile offspring over evolutionary time is not considered. Lloyd Morgan's canon (1894) has been mis interpreted and overused but is still a useful guide under some circumstances. Whereas some chapters are empirically grounded, others are basically concep tual. Editor McMillan wrote the Preface and four chapters, which are all variations on a theme. In one chapter he attempts to distinguish between such concepts as stress, distress, and emotions. In another, he focuses on the concept of emo tional maltreatment. McMillan provides a long definition covering both emo tional distress and emotional maltreatment. The former refers to "an unpleasant emotional affect at a level that exceeds coping capacity" and the latter to "actions (or inactions) of the animal care giver or other person (s) which, intentionally or unintentionally, cause, perpetuate, or intensify emotional distress" (p. 173). Just how these are recognized is not always clear. In one example provided, keeping a dog in "solitary confinement in a backyard" if it is "motivated by unpleasant loneliness-like feelings to seek companionship" (p. 171) would be regarded as harmful to the animal because of the failure to meet its emotional needs. It appears that many dogs that are much beloved by their owners would thus be regarded as emotionally maltreated in this view. In his chapter "Mental Wellness," McMillan approaches the difficult concept of quality of life in animals. "Quality of life" is the "assessment that an animal</page><page sequence="4">168 AMERICANJOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY, Spring 2007 makes of its life overall, of how its life is faring, experienced on a continuum of good to bad" (p. 193). Just which species, if any, have the cognitive capacity to do this is not clear. Elsewhere, he recognizes the difficulty in trying to assess mo mentary happy states, not to say long-term happiness, in nonverbal animals. The problems inherent in trying to recognize and measure such mental states remain unresolved. Nevertheless, Bernard Rollin regards the chapter as "a superb piece of philosophical argumentation and analysis" (p. 235). In a loosely written chapter, Rollin suggests that "animal subjective experience is pivotal to animal welfare and animal happiness" (p. 12). Elsewhere, Rollin develops an argument to justify genetic engineering to create animals that are better adapted to the conditions of captivity, especially the close confinement of some farm enclosures, than are nonengineered conspecifics. Marc Bekoff tries to come to terms with the issue of animal emotions. However, he seems inconsistent in his beliefs along these lines. He writes that "anyone who has ever lived with a dog or cat knows intuitively that mammals have rich emotional lives" (p. 15); "current research ... provides compelling evidence that at least some animals likely feel a full range of emotions, including fear, joy, happiness, shame, embarrassment, resentment,jealousy, rage, anger, love, pleasure, compas sion, respect, relief, disgust, sadness, despair, and grief" (p. 17); "the emotional states of many animals are easily recognizable" (p. 18); and "of course I cannot be absolutely certain thatJethro, my companion dog, was happy, sad, angry, upset or in love, but these words explain what he might be feeling" (p. 21). Michael W. Fox summarizes his efforts to reach the laudable goal of developing sound veterinary science with understanding, empathy, and respect. At times he appears to go overboard, as when he finds parallels between studies of Pavlovian conditioning in animals and Nazi medical experiments conducted in concentra tion camps. The skeptic may balk at the conclusion that "some controlled experi ments have demonstrated the beneficial effects of healing-directed prayer as well as distant or remote mental intentionality on such nonhuman subjects as bacteria, plants, chicks, gerbils, cats, and dogs" (p. 123). Experimental psychologists will find more to like in some of the more empiri cally grounded chapters. Michel Cabanac makes an effort to provide empirical evidence for some of the concepts asserted in the more conceptual chapters. Cabanac reviews research by himself and others that suggests that nonhuman animals, including lizards but not amphibians, experience such phenomena as emotional fever, emotional tachycardia, and pleasure. Many data are presented, but the details of the studies are rather thin, as would be expected in a review chapter, making it difficult to evaluate the conclusions. Nevertheless, this work provides a nice example of the heuristic value of the anthropomorphic orientation being advanced in these chapters. If this orientation leads to new and interesting research that would not have been done without it, it is a valuable approach in a pragmatic sense whether or not it represents some abstract "truth." Marian Stamp Dawkins states up front that in dealing with a concept such as suffering "we go beyond the boundaries of present-day science" (p. 50). She ar gues that the two keys essential to recognizing suffering in animals are whether it is physically healthy and whether and how much it wants to change the situation</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 169 it is in. She then adopts a logical positivist position of the sort despised by some of the other authors and argues that measuring operant responses by animals is "a powerful tool for assessing one major element of what we mean by suffer ing-that animals are highly motivated to remove themselves from a situation or to obtain something they have not got" (p. 54). Although this approach can be quibbled with, it does make the problem tractable and is potentially useful. As an example, she cites research by Danbury et al. showing that healthy chickens do not differentiate between food with an anti-inflammatory drug and that without, whereas lame birds choose the food with the helpful drug. One may ask whether animals always know what is good for them, however. Markowitz and Eckert provide an overview of some of their remarkable work in giving animals control over their environments. Working primarily in zoos, they have devised various tasks that enable animals to use naturally occurring behavioral patterns in foraging and hunting for food rather than having it thrown in the cage. As a result, the animals get exercise, and the public sees an animal engaging in behavior that approximates that seen in nature rather than one that appears lethargic. The classic example from Markowitz's work is that of the apparatus de signed to enable gibbons to brachiate naturally in large cages by requiring them to make operant responses at widely displaced, elevated sites. These beautiful animals are thus seen engaging in graceful behavior that enhances their health. Controllability, a theme in numerous other chapters, is here brought into sharp focus. The authors are cautious about anthropomorphic attributions and point out that "in assessing the apparent mental health of any animal, we are ultimately dependent on the careful analysis of behavior to decide its well-being. ... For example, unless one believes in magic or has a great deal more information than your authors do about crocodiles, it is very difficult to decide if a crocodile is mentally healthy, even after spending many weeks observing one in captivity" (p. 201). Temple Grandin is autistic and believes that, as a result, she can experience the world in a manner more similar to that of animals than can most people. She has used this ability successfully in designing apparatus and procedures for handling farm animals. Her chapter is focused on the effects of different kinds of environmental stimuli on animal emotions, especially fear. Her success in practical situations provides evidence of the utility of her approach. In a short chapter, Hal Markowitz and Gregory Timmel make a few salient points. The well-being of animals in research affects the results obtained. Some manipulations that may appear to improve well-being are ineffective. What is needed is research to determine exactly which treatments do and do not have measurable effects. Furthermore, funding is needed to support this research and enable its implementation. This is a hard-headed, empirically sound approach that is not mired in the problems of definition of many of the other chapters. Lesley King and Andrew Rowan's chapter on the mental health of laboratory animals deals with some of the fundamental issues addressed elsewhere in the volume. Unlike most other chapter authors, they recognize the importance of an evolutionary perspective for understanding the needs and behavior of animals in captivity. They note that emotional responses are important evolved mechanisms</page><page sequence="6">170 AMERICANJOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY, Spring 2007 that help animals to deal with their environments. Understanding these systems can help us design more humane facilities and procedures. In other chapters, Suzanne Hetts, Dan Estep, and Amy Marder bring their experience working with companion animals to bear on issues related to psycho logical well-being. Basically, caregivers must gain an understanding of the needs of the animal and work to provide opportunities so that these needs can be met without engaging in behavior that offends the caregiver. Jaak Panksepp uses a neuroethological approach to try to deal with emotions in animals. Panksepp delineates seven cross-species core emotional systems and discusses several lines of evidence from physiological studies that are relevant to these and related systems. Amy Marder andJ. Michelle Posage's chapter on pharmacologic methods includes a list of seven factors to consider when using drugs to treat behavior disorders and a long table listing various drugs, dosages, uses, relative costs, and side effects.John Wright, Pamela Reid, and Zack Rozier deal with nonpharmacologic treatments of behavioral disorders. Fran~oise Wemelsfelder addresses issues of boredom in humans and nonhu man animals. She argues that the boredom laboratory environments create can lead to decreased resistance to stress and to both behavioral and physiological changes that can seriously compromise research efforts. Karen Overall presents a well-reasoned treatment of the need for precision in diagnostic criteria in studies of mental illness in animals. It is hard to estimate the future impact of this volume. Many scientists will cat egorically dismiss it as tender-minded anthropomorphism directed at mental and emotional states that are intrinsically not susceptible to scientific analysis. Others may view the approach as the latest escape from the shackles of behavioristic think ing and may jump enthusiastically on board. An intermediate effect is possible. Despite its flaws, the book may have a more subtle effect on many readers, analo gous to that of Griffin's. Mainstream psychologists may reject many of the more extreme positions that are expressed. As they work through their views, however, some perspectives may be subtly changed somewhat in the direction suggested by McMillan and his chapter authors. They may become a bit more sensitive to issues of psychological well-being and perhaps undertake or reinterpret some relevant research. In this way, it could turn out to be an influential volume.
