Until now, the two most important objects of art, a strongly stylised female figure engraved on a mammoth tusk and an ivory- carved mammoth sculpture, have been pictured in most books on Palaeolithic art, but the total number of objects of artistic production remains unknown. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic images from Předmostí have been summarised in the preceding article (Valoch K., 1969: IPEK 22, 1966/69: 1–6). In this paper, we provide an overview of non- figurative engravings and personal ornaments. This article is a reprint of a previously published article (Valoch K., 1975: Anthropologie (Brno) 13, 1–2: 81–91). KEY WORDS: Předmostí – Palaeolithic art – Personal ornaments – Engravings – Pavlovian It is almost 100 years ago since the Palaeolithic camp researchers, the finds were never published together in site of Předmostí was discovered near Přerov on the river the form of a comprehensive monograph. Bečva in Central Moravia. Thanks to its unique pieces The two most important objects of art – a strongly of Palaeolithic art, bone tools and large quantities of stylised female figure engraved on a mammoth tusk and lithics, this site has brought fame to the Moravian an ivory-carved mammoth sculpture – have been Palaeolithic. It must be considered a misfortune of pictured in most books on Palaeolithic art, but the total destiny that, despite the effort of three generations of number of objects of artistic production remains This article is a reprint of a previously published article "VALOCH K., 1975: Ornamentale Gravierungen und Ziergegenstände von Předmostí bei Přerov in Mähren.

The bone is splintered lengthwise, bilaterally polished; the spongy bone on the back side is exposed. The sharp edge on top is worn; the lower part was chopped off by several blows. Ornamental decoration is partly preserved on the dorsal surface. It is composed of longitudinal and transversal rows of oblique grooves in a herringbone pattern. Essentially there are three longitudinal rows interrupted by two transversal bands. Figure 2:2. A stake-like object made from a thin piece of tusk, 9.5 cm long, round in cross-section, the upper part 32 mm in diameter. The upper end is formed by a slightly convex face bearing visible percussion marks of some soft object. In one place below the rim remnants of a triple line are preserved. The remaining surface is either smooth or worn or covered with sinter. On one side a part of the tusk lamella is split off along the entire length and the grooved natural structure is exposed. The lower end forms a pyramid-like tapered point with five facets, which are about 4.5 cm long and equipped with relatively sharp edges. The point is blunted with use. Four facets are decorated with incisions placed along the edges, one of them (picture on the left) also with four transversal rows. The numbers of preserved grooves are as follows: transversal rows top down 5, 8, 6, and 4; grooves at the edges of facet I (picture on the left) – left 12, facet II – left 19, middle 11, 9, and right 27, facet III (picture on the right) – left 11, 11, right 16, facet IV – 0, facet V – left 0, right 16. It is necessary, however, to remark that these numbers may not be exact due to use, wear and small sinter residues. Figure 2:1. A stake-like object made from a thin piece of tusk, 7 cm long, round in cross-section, the upper part 25 mm in diameter. The lower end is tapered to form a conical point. The upper face, originally cut off, is slightly convex in shape and has the supposed percussion marks of some soft object. This activity caused a splinter to be removed on the left side. The surface is smoothed, from the back a thin lamella was split off and the grooved natural structure is exposed. On the front some grooves can be observed: top left 6 in vertical direction, below them 6 in arched layout and 7 in an oblique row, which is, however, probably not complete due to damage. Figure 7:8.

Might we suppose that grooves may be records of days within individual lunar to the Upper Palaeolithic people such a triangular shape phases, that is a real lunar calendar (Marshack 1970, was already considered to be the symbol for the heart? 1972).

The decoration on the pointed working end of the stake-like tool is unusual, which was abraded with use; any record in this area would not have been very durable. Isolated groups and bands/rows of grooves on various bones and tusk fragments did not have any decorative purpose and we can regard them Dr. Karel Valoch with certainty only as recordings; but whether they have Anthropos Institute taken note only of lunar transits or also of other events Moravian Museum remains undecided. It is possible that the finding by Nám. 25. února 7 A. Marshack represents only the first step towards the 659 37 Brno knowledge of the diverse spiritual culture of the Upper ČSSR Palaeolithic people. The very varied quantity of grooves in individual rows and groups, however, does not allow any considerations about the meaning of these finds based on repeated occurrence of particular numbers of grooves. The engravings on tusk ends (Figures 3:2, 9:3) may have had only a decorative symbolical meaning. In this regard, we note the famous female figure made in a geometric style, which is among the most valuable objects of Palaeolithic art (Valoch 1969: Taf. I). The exclusively symbolic nature of the heart-shaped slate pebble was already mentioned above. Provided that the ellipsoid pendant (Figure 6:1) has indeed been used as a bullroarer, the engraving must also have had a deeper ritual meaning. We will content ourselves with these findings. It is beyond doubt that both the figurative and non-figurative art and various ornaments played an important role in the world of ideas of Palaeolithic people. However, decoding them is extremely hard because it would require putting ourselves into spiritual atmosphere of the people.
