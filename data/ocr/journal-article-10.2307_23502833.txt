<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE SADDUCEES AND THE PHARISEES By JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH, Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, Ohio. /"\NE of the important disputes between the Sadducees and Pharisees was about the manner in which the High Priest should bring in the incense into the Holy of Holies to be offered there on the Day of Atonement. The Sadducees claimed that the offering must be prepared outside of the Holy of Holies. Their practice demanded of the High Priest to put the incense upon the censer outside of the curtain, which separated the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Temple, and, while the smoke of the incense was coming up, to carry the censer with the smoking incense on it into the Holy of Holies and offer it there. The Pharisees, on the other hand, insisted that the incense should not be put on the censer outside of the Holy of Holies, but that the High Priest should enter the Holy of Holies carrying the censer with the fiery coals in his right hand and the spoon full of incense in his left hand. Only after he had entered inside the curtain should he put the incense upon the fiery coals on the censer and thus offer it there. The Biblical law prescribing this offering of the incense in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement is found in Leviticus XVI, 12-13 and reads as follows: ולקח מלא המחתה גחלי אש מעל המזבח מלפני יי ומלא חפניו קטרת סמיס דקה והביא מבית לפרכת. ונתן את הקטרת על האש לפני יי וכסה ענן הקטרת את הכפרת אשר על העדות ולא ימות. "And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil. And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the Ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not." It cannot be denied that the plain meaning of these Scriptural 173</page><page sequence="2">174 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH passages favors the Pharisees.1 The interpretation put upon these two verses by the Pharisees is syntactically correct. The two consecutive verses prescribe consecutive actions. The priest should first enter within the veil and then, while inside, put the incense upon the fire. It is, therefore, evident that the difference of opinion between the two parties in this specific case was not merely the result of their well-known different methods of inter preting the Law. For as a rule the Sadducees insisted upon a strictly literal interpretation of the Law, while the Pharisees fav ored a free and more liberal interpretation. In this case, how ever, they have apparently reversed their positions. It is also impossible to consider this difference between the two parties merely as the result of their respective attitudes towards the unwritten law or traditional practice. We cannot assume, as some modern scholars2 following Maimonides3 do, 1 Compare A. Geiger in Osar Nehmad, IV, p. 106; M. M. Kalisch, A His toricaltorical and Critical Commentary on the Old Testament (London 1872) to this passage in Leviticus; D. Hoffmann, Das Buck Leviticus (Berlin 1905), pp. 446-447. There seems to be one difficulty in this interpretation of the Phari sees in that it seemingly takes the expression 'לפני ד in this verse as designating the Holy of Holies, when in many other passages of the Scriptures the same expression designates also the place outside of the Holy of Holies. This diffi culty, however, is only apparent. It is true, that the Babylonian Gemara understood the Pharisees to have based their argument on the interpretation of the phrase 'לפני ד in verse 13 as designating the Holy of Holies. But, as will be shown in the course of this essay, the Pharisees did not base their argument upon the interpretation of the phrase 'לפני ד and they did not at all stress the interpretation of this phrase as designating the Holy of Holies. 2 Rudolf Leszynsky, Die Sadducaer (Berlin 1912), p. 61, without referring to Maimonides says: "Beide Parteien berufen sich auf Schriftverse, aber da der Sinn des Pentateuch-Abschnittes mehr fur die Sadducaer spricht, so miissen wir auch hier annehmen, dass die Pharisaer von einer miindlichen Ueberlieferung ausgegangen waren." Against his opinion, that the passage of the Pentateuch favors the Sadducees, see the authorities quoted in the preceding note. נ The passage in Yad, Abodat Yom ha-Kippurim, I, 7, reads as follows: והיו &lt;הצדוק'ן&gt; אופרין שקטרת של יום הכפירים מניהין אותה על האש בהיכל חוץ לפרוכת וכשיעלה עשנה מכניס אותה לפנים לקדש הקדשים הטעם זה שכתוב כתורה כי בענן אראה על הכפורת אמרו כי הוא ענן הקטרת ומפי השמועה למדו חכמים שאין נותן הקטרת אלא בקדש הקדשים לפני הארון שנאמר ונתן הקטרת על האש לפני ד'. Maimonides does not give any source for his statement that the Pharisaic position was based upon a tradition מפי השסועה. It is also very strange that</page><page sequence="3">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 175 that the Pharisees followed an oral tradition when they insisted upon their interpretation of the Law in this case. In the first place, it is rather difficult to believe that the Pharisees could have been in possession of an old traditional law in regard to the performance of a ritual of which the Sadducean priests, who alone had been performing it for generations, were ignorant. Furthermore, such a theory would leave unexplained why the Sadducees in this case refused to follow the alleged traditional practice of the Pharisees, especially when, as we have seen, the literal meaning of the written law also favors this practice. We would then have to find some valid reason or some strong cause that prompted the Sadducean priests to depart from the old traditional practice based upon a correct literal interpretation of the written Law. But above all, the theory which assumes that the Pharisees in this case followed an oral tradition, is without any foundation. There is not the least support for it in the Talmudic literature. In the case of other practices, not expressly commanded in the written Law but advocated by the Pharisees, we do find that the Pharisaic teach ers declare such practices to be based upon an institution of the prophets (יסוד נביאים) or a traditional law handed down from Moses on Sinai ('.(הלכה למשה מסיני• But, to my knowledge, no statement can be found in Talmudic literature declaring the manner of offering the incense on the Day of Atonement, as advocated by the Pharisees, to have been based on an older oral tradition. In the disputes between the Sadducees and Pharisees regarding this ceremony, as reported in the Talmud, the Phari sees do not advance the argument of Tradition and no reference Maimonides seems to have understood that only the Sadducees interpreted the word בענן as referring to the smoke of the incense, when as a matter of fact the Pharisees never disputed this. Maimonides followed the Babylonian Gemara and understood the Pharisees to have based their argument upon the interpretation of the words לפני די, in verse 13. Considering this Scriptural proof as not very sound he concluded that the Pharisees must have followed a tradition. Cp. also H. Oppenheim in Bet Talmud, IV, (Wien 1885), pp. 269-271. Oppenheim failed to see the real significance of this controversy, and his explanation of the difference of opinion on this question between the Sadducees and Pharisees is far fetched and pilpulistic. 4 P. Shebiit I, 7 (33b); B. Sukkah 44a.</page><page sequence="4">176 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACII at all is made to the older traditional practice as to how and in what manner it was performed. Had the older practice been like the one advocated by their party or had there been an oral tra dition favoring their opinion, the Pharisaic teachers certainly would have mentioned it. In such cases an argumentum e silentiosilentio has considerable weight. It is, therefore, safe to assume, as will indeed be shown in this essay, that in this case the Sadducees followed the traditional time-honored practice, while the Pharisees were not the advo cates of an old oral tradition on this subject but the innovators of a radical reform. No doubt they had a very good reason for seeking to introduce this reform in the Temple service and to change the form of one of the most solemn rites of the Day of Atonement. From the Talmudic reports about this controversy it is evident that each party attached great importance to its own special idea about the performance of this ceremony. From this we may conclude that a very important doctrine or a basic theological conception was involved in this controversy. There must have been a fundamental principle underlying this differ ence of opinion between the two parties. But we cannot obtain any direct and definite information from the ancient sources as to what this fundamental principle was, or what the real reasons were that prompted the two parties to insist so strongly upon their respective interpretation of this ritual law. The Talmudic reports apparently content themselves with merely presenting the two opposite opinions held respectively by the two parties and giving the Scriptural passages which each party cited in support of its peculiar view. These reports do not tell us, at least not on the surface, whether and how each party met the arguments of the other. We can well understand that the Talmudic reports, coming from the Pharisaic circles, would refrain from reporting how the Sadducees answered the argu ments of the Pharisees. But strangely enough these Talmudic reports mention one apparently very strong argument advanced by the Sadducees in favor of their position, but do not tell us, at least not expressly, what the Pharisees' answer to this argument was. And even in their presentation of the Pharisees' arguments, which was based upon a correct interpretation of Scriptural</page><page sequence="5">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 177 passages, they do not emphasize the strong points in this argu ment and apparently fail to make the best of the Scriptural interpretation which favors the Pharisaic opinion on this matter. On the whole one gets the impression from the Talmudic reports that the Pharisees offered poor arguments though they had a very good cause. Yet, there can be no doubt that the Rabbis of the Talmud were convinced that the Pharisees' position on this question was correct. Why, then, did they not bring out clearly all the good reasons justifying the Pharisaic position? Was there any special cause for this reluctance on the part of the Rabbis to state in full all the arguments of the Phari sees? Were the real motives which prompted the Pharisees to insist upon their interpretation of such a nature as to make the Rabbis hesitate to speak about them openly and expressly? It seems to me that this was the case. A careful scrutiny of the Talmudic reports, however, combined with a consideration of what is otherwise known about the character of the two parties, their respective religious outlooks and theological positions, will reveal the fundamental principle underlying this controversy and also explain why the Rabbis of the Talmud refrained from mak ing a clear statement about the real issue involved in the con troversy. Let us, therefore, first examine carefully all the Talmudic reports about this controversy, notice the difficulties found in them and see to what extent the information thus obtained can help us, directly or indirectly, to a correct understanding of the respective positions of the two parties. In a Baraita in Sifra (Ahare Mot III, Weiss 81b, quoted also in P. Yoma 1,5, 39ab) we read the following account of the dis pute between the two parties in regard to the offering of the incense on the Day of Atonement. והביא אל מבית לפרוכת ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני ה' שלא יתקן מבחוץ ויכניס מבפנים שהרי הצדוקים אומרים יתקן מבחוץ ויכניס מבפנים. אם לפני בשר ודם עושים כן קל וחומר לפני המקום. ואומר כי בענן אראה על הכפורת. אמרו להם חכמים והלא כבר נאמר ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני הי. אינו נותן אלא בפנים. אם כן למה נאמר כי בענן אראה על הכפורת מלמד שהיה נותן בה מעלה עשן. ומנין שהוא נותן בה מעלה עשן תלמוד לומר וכסה ענן הקטורת את</page><page sequence="6">178 JACOB 2. LAUTERBACH הכפורת אשר על העדות ולא ימות הא אם לא נתן בה (לא היה) מעלה עשן או שחיסר אחת מכל סממניה חייב מיתה. On the surface this Baraita presents some difficulties. It appar ently fails to make out a good case for the Pharisees, though it indicates that they had good reasons for their opinion. By citing the second half of verse 12 והביא אל מבית לפרכת together with the first half of verse 13 ונתן את הקטרת על האש לפני יי, as the Scriptural basis for the Pharisaic interpretation, the Baraita clearly indi cates, though it does not expressly state it, that the Pharisees derived their positive Scriptural proof from the syntactic order of the two verses and not merely from the words לפני יי "before the Lord" in verse 13.5 This proof, as we have seen, is very sound. Yet, in arguing with their opponents, the Pharisees, in so far as the Baraita reports it, did not make use of this proof. The Sadducees, as we learn from this Baraita, advanced two arguments in favor of their practice. One was the argument of propriety based upon considerations of respect and reverence for the Deity. It would be disrespectful to God, they claimed, to prepare the incense in His very presence, in the Holy of Holies. If when presenting incense to a human being we do not fix it in his presence but prepare it outside before we bring it in to him, how much the more should we do so when offering incense to God. To this seemingly good argument the Pharisees do not, according to the Baraita, give a direct and clear answer. Their answer, as we shall see, may imply a refutation of the Sadducean posi tion, but it is not a clear and direct answer to the Sadducean argument. The Pharisees reply by saying והלא כבר נאמר ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני ה' "and is it not said 'and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord?'" They do not give the full Scriptural proof for their position as cited in the opening of the Baraita. They do not say והלא כבר נאמר והביא אל מבית לפרוכת ואחר כך ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני ה' which would have been a s It was thus correctly understood by R. Samson of Sens (1150-1230) who in his commentary to the Sifra (Warsaw 1863) makes the following com ment upon our passage: שלא יתן מבחוץ ויכניש שהרי כתב והביא ולאחר כן ונתן את הקטורת. R. Aaron Ibn Hayyim in his commentary קרבן אהרן (Venice 1609), however, followed the Babylonian Gemara and understood the argument as being based upon the interpretation of the words 'לכני ד as designating the Holy of Holies.</page><page sequence="7">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 179 good argument for their opinion. They merely say: והלא כבר נאמר ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני ה' which on the surface is a very poor answer to the Sadducean position. For the words ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני ה', which alone they quote here, do not in themselves prove that the incense must be prepared in the Holy of Holies. For the Pharisees certainly could not have denied that the expression לפני יי, "before the Lord," could designate also the place outside of the curtain which separated the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Temple.6 In fact, they do not say that this Scriptural passage proves that the incense must be pre pared inside of the curtain, for it is to be noticed, they do not say מלמד שאינו נותן אלא מבפנים. The words אינו נותן אלא מבפנים which follow their answer to the Sadducean argument form an independent sentence in which the Pharisees merely reiterate their position. They are not the logical consequence of the preceding answer to the Sadducees. The answer to the Saddu cean argument of propriety consisted merely in the words והלא כבר נאמר ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני יי. We shall find that this answer implies a refutation of the Sadducean position but it certainly is not a clear and direct answer to the Sadducean argument. The second argument of the Sadducees was, according to the Baraita, based upon the Scriptural passage כי בענן אראה על הכפורת (Levit. XVI,2), which they evidently interpreted to mean, "only through the cloud of the smoke of the incense may I be seen upon the Ark-cover." This is not a strong argument at all. In the first place, the word בענן may simply mean "in a cloud," as the ancient versions understood it,7 and not refer to the smoke of the incense. Secondly, even if the word בענן meant "through the smoke of the incense," the Scriptural passage, taken by itself, would merely say that God may be seen only through a screen of smoke with out, however, specifying where that screen of smoke must be produced and started. But strangely enough, weak as this argument is, the Pharisees' answer to this argument seems s 11 weaker. The Pharisees admit that the word בענן in this passage designates the smoke of the incense, but they claim that this Scriptural passage merely teaches that in preparing the incense 6 As e.g. Leviticus I, 5; IV, 4 and 7 and many others. ' See Geiger, 0$ar Nehmad, IV, p. 107.</page><page sequence="8">180 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH the priest should mix in it a smoke-producing ingredient. Now why did the Pharisees not interpret the Scriptural passage to have no reference at all to the smoke of the incense but merely to mean "with a cloud of glory I shall appear upon the ark cover," as it was understood by the ancient versions? By admit ting that the word בענן here means the smoke of the incense and insisting that the incense must contain מעלה עשן, a smoke-pro ducing ingredient, they rather play into the hands of their opponents. The Sadducees certainly insisted that the incense must produce a cloud of smoke. But they also insisted that the smoke must be produced outside of the curtain, and on this point the Pharisees prove nothing to the contrary. For their interpretation, that the Scriptural passage means that the incense must contain a smoke-producing ingredient, does not positively prove that the smoke must be produced inside and not outside of the curtain. Furthermore, after this interpréta tion of the Scriptural passage, according to which the words בי בענן אראה על הכפורת teach that the incense contained a smoke producing ingredient, the Baraita immediately goes on to ask ומנין שהוא נותן בה מעלה עשן "but how do we know that he must mix with the incense a smoke-producing ingredient?" and in answer it cites another Scriptural passage to prove it. But if the requirement of מעלה עשן is prescribed in the words וכסה ענן הקטורת את הכפורת אשר על העדות ולא ימות then the words כי בענן אראה על הכפורת cannot be interpreted to prescribe the same thing, as the Pharisees claimed. This difficulty, as we shall see, was indeed felt by the Babylonian Gemara. Again in closing the argument the Baraita adds something which does not belong to the subject under discussion. Instead of merely stating that if he does not put in a smoke-producing ingredient he deserves death, הא אם לא נתן בה מעלה עשן חייב מיתה, the Baraita says, if he does not put into it the smoke-producing ingredient, or if he omits any one of its ingredients he deserves death : הא אם לא נתן בה מעלה עשן או שחיסר אחת מכל סממנ־ה חייב מיתה. This gratuitous informa tion about the death penalty for omitting any one of the ingre dients is entirely out of place here, especially since it is not obvious how it could be derived from the words וכסה ענן הקטורת את הכפורת וכו'.</page><page sequence="9">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 181 The same Baraita is also quoted in the Babylonian Talmud (Yoma 53a) with some significant changes. Here we read as follows : ת"ר ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני ה' שלא יתקן מבחוץ ויכניס להוציא מלבן של צדוקים שאוסרים יתקן מבחוץ ויכניס מאי דרוש כי בענן אראה על הכפורת מלמד שיתקן מבהוץ ויכניס אמרו להם הכמים והלא כבר נאמר ונתן את הקטרת על האש לפני ה' אם כן מה תלמוד לומר כי בענן אראה על הכפורת מלמד שנותן בה מעלה עשן ומניין שנותן בה מעלה עשן שנאמר וכסה ענן הקטורת את הכפורת הא לא נתן בה מעלה עשן או שחסר אחת מכל סמניה חייב מיתה. It appears from this version of the Baraita that the Babylonians did not know that the Pharisees derived their positive Scriptural proof from the syntactic order of the two verses 12-13 in Levit. XVI. They evidently understood the Pharisaic argument to be derived merely from the words 'לפני ה in verse 13, interpreting these words to designate the Holy of Holies, and, therefore, in the opening of the Baraita only verse 13 is cited as the Scriptural basis for the Pharisaic opinion. For this reason also the exchange of opinions between the two parties as regards the propriety of preparing the incense in the Holy of Holies is omitted. For on the surface the Pharisees' argument, והלא כבר נאמר ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני ה' merely repeats the main Scriptural proof for the Pharisaic position, as put by the Babylonians in the opening of the Baraita, and does not give any direct answer to the argument of propriety advanced by the Sadducees. Not finding in the Pharisees' reply an answer to the Sadducean argument of pro priety, the Babylonians omitted the whole dispute as to the propriety from their version of the Baraita. According to their understanding of the dispute, they would strengthen the position of the Pharisees by supressing a seemingly strong argument of the Sadducees. They also realized the weakness of the Phari sees' answer to the other argument of the Sadducees from the words כי בענן אראה על הכפורת. For, in commenting upon the Baraita, the Gemara points to the difficulty which we have noticed above, namely, that after declaring that the words כי בענן אראה על הכפורת teach the requirement of מעלה עשן in the incense, the Baraita asks for and cites another Scriptural proof</page><page sequence="10">182 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH for the indispensable requirement of 8.מעלה עשן The Gemara pointedly asks ?קרא לקרא, "Why pile one Scriptural proof upon another?" It goes on to cite many attempts to explain why two verses were necessary for this teaching. One of these explana tions is that from the passage כי בענן אראה על הכפורת we would know only that the incense offered on the Day of Atonement requires מעלה עשן, hence we need the passage 'וכסה ענן הקטרת וכר to teach us that the incense of every day in the year also requires מעלה עשן. All these explanations, however, are merely attempts to smoothe over an apparent difficulty which they had noticed in the Pharisees' answer to the argument from כי בענן אראה על הכפורת. The real difficulty in this answer of the Pharisees, viz, that even if we accept the interpretation that the passage implies the necessity of מעלה עשן in the incense, it does not prove that the incense must be prepared inside of the curtain; this difficulty is not touched upon nor even hinted at by any of the Rabbis of the Talmud. We thus see that the Baraita reporting this controversy contains some difficulties and from its presentation of the argu ments of the two parties we cannot get a satisfactory explanation of their respective positions. Let us now seek to ascertain what superstitions or primitive beliefs were connected with the Holy of Holies and especially with the offering brought there on the Day of Atonement, beliefs which no doubt lingered on in the popular mind a long time after the teachers and the enlightened people had outgrown them, and allusions to which may still be found in the Talmudic legends. A knowledge of these primitive notions or popular beliefs, connected with the Holy of Holies, may help us to under stand the struggle of ideas and the theological issue involved in this controversy between the two parties. It cannot be denied that the primitive notion was that the 8 The Yerushalmi also felt this difficulty though it does not express it. For at the close of the Baraita there the additional statement is found: ולא ימות הרי זה עונש ני כענן אראה הרי זה אזהרה which explains why the two verses were necessary. At the same time this statement seeks to emphasize that the ולא ימות means, so that he shall not incur the penalty of death, and not, that he may not die as a direct consequence of seeing the Deity. See note 23.</page><page sequence="11">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 183 Tabernacle, and later on the Temple in Jerusalem, were the residences of God on earth and that the Holy of Holies within the Temple was especially the place where He dwelt, the Ark cover with the two Cherubim being, so to speak, His throne. The Rabbis often sought to suppress or modify these primitive beliefs, or at least to remove from them the crude anthropomor phic elements, but they were not always successful. These primitive beliefs were retained by the people and echoes of them are found in the Talmud and in the Midrashim. Thus we are told in the Midrash (Exod. R. Ill, 4) that the Divine residence on earth resembles in most of its features the Divine residence in heaven. We are also told that, while God had chosen the entire land of Palestine as the place where His presence was manifested, He had especially favored the Temple in Jerusalem and within this Temple He had particularly selected the Holy of Holies as His residence (ibid. XXXVII, 4). In this earthly residence He had His throne which was believed to be corresponding to and as it were a projection of the throne in heaven (Mekilta, Shirata I, Friedmann 43b, P. Berakot IV, 5,8c). This throne in the Holy of Holies consisted of the Ark-cover with the two Cherubim on which was the seat of God (Numbers R. IV, 13. cp. also Sukkah 4b-5a and R. H. 31a, Exodus R. XXXIV, 1 and Tanhuma, Ki Tisa 10, Vayakhel 6). Because the Ark was the throne of God, the priests, even when moving the Taber nacle, had to take special precautions never to look at the Ark. There was a special spread of blue color (כליל תכלת) with which the Ark and the Cherubim were covered. For as the heavenly throne according to Ezechiel I, 26 was of blue color, "as the appearance of a sapphire stone," so also the throne in the Holy of Holies, i.e. the Ark and the Cherubim had to appear in blue color, hence the blue spread to cover it (Numbers R., I.e., cp. also Menahot 43b and Sifre, Numbers 115).9 In the second Temple, י The tendency on the part of the early Halakah to combat these primitive notions and to suppress these anthropomorhpic conceptions was, to my mind, the cause of a radical reform in the law of $i?it, prescribed in Numbers XV, 37-40. The importance of the Çiçit consisted in the blue thread, the פתיל תכלת, which was added to them. This blue thread was to serve as reminder to do all the commandments, "that ye may look upon it (the blue thread) and</page><page sequence="12">184 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH in which the A1k was missing, the throne of glory continued to be on the same spot where the Ark once stood. The throne now was on the stone אבן שחיה which took the place of the Ark (cp. Mishnah Yoma V, 2). Commenting upon the verse in Job XXXIX, 28, the Midrash (Pesikta Rabbati, Ahare Mot, Fried mann 190) says: סלע ישכון בבנין הראשון שהיה שם ארון ואפילו בבנין העני שלא היה שם ארון אלא אבן שם היה כבודי על שן הסלע ומצודה, cp. also Tanhuma, Ahare Mot 3).10 As a corollary to the belief that God's residence was in the remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them." The blue thread could serve this purpose because it resembled the throne of glory which is also blue in color (Sifre, Numbers 115, Menahot 43b). The Rabbis, however, at a very early time began to object to the use of the blue thread in connection with the Siçit. Thus R. Eleazer b. Çadok (second half of first century) tells us that in Jerusalem it was a strange thing, causing surprise, if one would put the blue thread upon his Çisit (Menahot 40a). From Sabbath 153a it is also evident that the Rabbis preferred white $isit. The use of the blue thread was discarded not because the art of producing the special dye necessary for making the הכלת was forgotten (against A. Epstein, Bel Talmud, V, (Wien 1886), p. 229 ff.) but because the Rabbis wished to suppress or avoid the anthropomorphic idea as if there ac ually were in heaven a throne of glory blue in color (see my remarks in the B'nai B'rith Manual, Cincinnati 1926, p. 27). Of course, this reform, like so many others, was not effected all at once. The use of the תכלת lingered on and even in Amoraic times they still had the genuine תכלת and, no doubt, some people still used it in their Çiçit. In the sixth century however, after the close of the Talmud, the use of תכלת was entirely discarded. See Epstein I.e.I.e.I.e. p. 305. 10 Even after the destruction of the Temple the Shekinah, according to some popular beliefs, continued to be present in the place of the Holy of Holies. See the discussion in P. Berakot IV, (8c). According to other legends, how ever, the Shekinah, after ten wanderings from the Ark-cover to the Cherub, from the Cherub to the threshold, etc., left the Holy of Holies and the entire precinct of the Temple and returned to her pristine abode in heaven (R. H. 31a). R. Petahiah of Ratisbon (second half of the 12th century) in his Sib bub bub (ed. Griinhut, Jerusalem 1904), p. 35, tells of a legend, current among the Jews in Jerusalem, that the Shekinah left the Temple through the Eastern gate, called the Gates of Mercy (שערי רחפיב). Dr. Julian Morgenstern in an essay on "The Gates of Righteousness," which he kindly showed me in manu script, treats this and other legends about the Eastern gate very exhaustively. He also cites many other references, from Jewish and non-Jewish sources, to the popular beliefs about the visible presence of the Deity in the Temple at Jerusalem. As his essay will soon be published I refrain from quoting these references here.</page><page sequence="13">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 185 Temple and His throne in the Holy of Holies, there was the other primitive notion that God held court in His residence on earth just as He held court in heaven. For this reason, on the Day of Atonement, when final judgment was passed upon the people by the Divine court, the High Priest, bringing a special offering would enter the Holy of Holies into the very presence of the Deity, in order to obtain forgiveness for the people. At this occasion, when entering into the very presence of the Deity, the High Priest had to be clad in white garments (Yoma 31b, 32b and 35a), in order to appear like one of the ministering angels. For כשירות של מעלן כך שירות של מטן, just as the service in the heavenly abode was performed by attendants dressed in white linen garments so also the service in the earthly abode, in the Holy of Holies, had to be performed by an attendant dressed in white linen garments (P. Yoma VII, 3, 44b; Levit. R. XXI, 11, cp. also Exodus R. XXXVIII, 3 and 8).11 11 The white garments were also aimed to deceive Satan who, when seeing the High Priest dressed in white, would mistake him for an angel and not seek to harm him. The custom, still prevailing in the Synagogue, that the pious wor shippers, and especially the reader and the leader in the service, wear a white robe ("Sargenes" or "Kittel") on the Day of Atonement also aims to make the worshippers appear like angels. Like many other ceremonies observed on the Day of Atonement, as fasting, standing up, and not wearing shoes, it has also the effect of causing Satan to believe that the worshippers are like angels and without sin (Pirke d. R. Eliezer, Ch. 46). The custom of burying the dead in a white shroud also had its origin in these primitive beliefs. It aims to make the dead appear like angels and thus gain for them admittance to heaven among the angels. This purpose of the white shroud has been misunderstood, or possibly purposely ignored, by the Babylonian Gemara (M. K. 27b). It is evident from the Palestinian Talmud (Kilayim IX, 4,32b, cp. also B. Sabbath 114a) that those Rabbis who were sure of their having lived a righteous life, and, therefore, confident that they would enter heaven and be admitted to the banquet hall, did not hesitate to request to be buried in white garments so as to be properly attired for the banquet (cp. also B. Sabbath 153a: R. Eliezer's answer to his disciples and R. johanan b. Zakkai's parable, and 2 Esdras, II, 38-40; further Revelation III, 4-5; IV, 4, and XIX, 14). Other Rabbis, like R. Yannai, whose modesty caused them not to be so sure about their being admitted immediately after death to the banquet hall in heaven, requested to be buried neither in white nor in black but rather in gray garments.

LAUTERBACH When court was held in the Holy of Holies, the Divine resi dence on earth, it was not God alone, sitting on His throne, upon the Ark-cover or upon the אבן שתיה, that was present there, but also both the pleading and accusing angels assembled around Him. They surrounded Him in the same manner as when court was held in heaven. The Deity, or some manifestation of the Divine presence, as well as a vision of the angels and of Satan, the accuser, could, therefore under favorable conditions, and to especially favored persons, appear in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement. This belief is clearly indicated in the Tal mud and in the Midrashim. Thus in Sifra, Shemini I, (Weiss 43c) we read the following statement which clearly points to the fear that Satan might bring before God accusations against the High Priest when the latter entered the Sanctuary to obtain for giveness: מלמד שאמר לו משה לאהרן, אהרן אחי אף על פי שנתרצה המקום לכפר על עונותיך צריך אתה ליתן לתוך פיו של שטן שלח דורון לפניך עד שלא כביאתך למקדש. (read12 תיכנס למקדש שמא ישנאך (ישטינך The expression שמא ישטינך כביאתך למקדש alludes to the belief that Satan might be in the Sanctuary, where the Divine court was held, so that Aaron, when entering, might find the accuser facing him. In Pesikta Rabbati, I.e. (Friedmann 191), it is ex pressly stated that Satan was in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement, seeking to accuse Aaron, or the High Priest, but ran away as soon as he saw the merits that entered with Aaron. The passage reads, as follows: ואף אהרן כשהיה נכנס לבית קדשי הקדשים אילולי זכיות הרבה שהיו נכנסות עמו ומסייעות אותו לא היה יכול לעמוד שעה the other place where there is mourning and all are dressed in black, they should not be conspicuous by appearing like a bridegroom among mourners. It is, therefore, evident that R. Gamaliel was honored and not (as suggested in M. K., I.e., by the phrase ונהג קלות ראש בעצמו) slighted when he was buried in white garments. The people believed that he had lived a righteous life and that he would, therefore, surely enter heaven and be admitted to the banquet, and they, accordingly, dressed him in the proper attire, i.e. in white garments for for his journey to heaven. In the course of time all the people wished to suggest that their departed relatives were worthy of entering heaven and they, therefore, buried their dead in white garments. " So it is quoted by רמבין in his commentary to Levit.

The Talmudic legends about the High Priest Simon the Just, who on the Day of Atonement of the last year of his life knew and told the people that he was going to die during the coming year, also clearly indicate this popular belief.14 Thus in Yoma 39b also Menaljot 109b) the following Baraita is found: תנו רבנן אותה שנה שמת בה שמעון הצדיק אמר להם בשנה זו הוא מת אמרו לו מנין אתה יודע אמר להם בכל יום הכפורים היה מזדמן לי זקן אחד לבוש לבנים ועטוף לבנים נכנס עמי ויוצא עמי והיום נזדמן לי זקן אחד לבוש שחורים ועטוף שחורים נכנס עמי ולא יצא עמי. אחר הרגל חלה שבעה ימים ומת. 13 According to this reading suggested by R. Ephraim Z. Margulies in his commentary to the Pesikta (Warsaw 1893), on the basis of the reading in the parallel passage in Exodus R. XXXVIII, and accepted by Friedmann in his edition of the Pesikta, the angels would resent the intrusion of a mortal into their midst, (cp. Sabbat 88b). The actual reading in the Pesikta, however, is: לעמוד שעה אחת מלאכי השרת שם. This reading makes no sense. Possibly, this reading is due to a mistake by a copyist who misunderstood an abbreviation. Originally the text had: לעמוד שעה אחת מהש' שם. The abbreviation, 'מהש which stood for מהשטן, was misunderstood by a copyist to be an abbreviation of מלאכי השרת. 14 Not Satan alone but a whole band of his subordinates were present in the Holy of Holies. This is clearly stated in Levit. R. XXI, 3: אם תחנה עלי מחנה של סמאל לא יירא לבי שהבטחתני בזאת יבא אהרן אל הקדש. This belief that Satan and his band had, as it were, an official residence in the Holy of Holies is also pre sumed in the legend told in Yoma 69b and evidently based on Zachariah V, 8. The returned exiles, this legend tells us, fasted three successive days, pray ing that the יצרא דעבודה זרה, the evil one who incites people to idolatry, be delivered unto them. Their prayer was granted and the יצר הרע of idolatry (יצר הרע is identical with Satan, see B. B. 16a) was delivered unto them. They saw coming out from the Holy of Holies a fiery young lion נפק אתא כי גוריא דנורא מבית קדשי הקדשים (I would correct the text to read כי גדיא דנורא like a fiery goat for Satan has sometimes the appearance of a goat. Cp. Targum YonathanYonathan to Levit. IX,3: צפיר בר עיזי מטול דסטנא מימתיל ביה). The prophet told them that this fiery creature was the יצרא דעבודה זרה and they caught him and burned him. From that time on they never suffered from idolatrous proclivi ties. They also prayed for the delivery of another one of Satan's band but this was not fully granted them. Now, if the one of Satan's band that was deliv ered unto them came out of the Holy of Holies, he must have had his residence there. Dr. Morgenstern, in the essay referred to above, suggests that the vision in Zachariah III reflects such a scene in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement when the High Priest stood before God and Satan sought to accuse him.</page><page sequence="16">188 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH We are not told how, from the fact that an old man dressed in black went in with him and remained there after he went out, Simon concluded that he was going to die during that year. The commentators do not comment on this Baraita. Rashi in Menahot, I.e., makes only one brief remark. To the words נכנס עמי Rashi remarks, לפני ולפנים, that it means the old man went in with him to the Holy of Holies. The meaning of the whole report, to my mind, is this. The good angels were pictured as dressed in white. The accusing angels, Satan and his band, on the other hand, were dressed in black. When an old person dressed in white went in with him, Simon knew that it was one of the pleading angels who came in to help him and to plead for him. The good angel left with him only after he had succeeded in obtaining for him pardon and a decree of life. When, on the other hand, in the last year of his life he noticed that a man dressed in black went in with him, he realized that he was without a pleading angel and that he was followed by the accuser. And when the accuser remained inside, continuing his accusations, without a pleading angel to refute them, Simon knew that his fate was sealed and that he was going to die. The same Baraita with a significant variation is also found in Tosefta Sotah XIII, 8 and in the Palestinian Talmud (Yoma V, 3, 42c) where it is fol lowed by a very interesting discussion. Here it reads as follows: ובשנה אחרונה אמר להם בשנה הזאת אני מת אמרו לו מאיכן אתה יודע אמר להן בל שנה ושנה שהייתי נכנס לבית קודש הקדשים היה זקן אחד לבוש לבנים ועטוף לבנים נכנס עמי ויוצא עמי ובשנה הזו נכנס עמי ולא יצא עמי. בעון קומי ר' אבהו הכתיב וכל אדם לא יהיה באהל מועד בבאו לכפר בקודש עד צאתו אפילו אותן שכתוב בהן ודמות פניהם פני אדם לא יהיו באוהל מועד אמר לון מה אמר לי דהוה בר נש אנא אמר הקב"ה הוה. Here the reference to the accusing angel dressed in black is left out. According to this version of the Baraita, the failure of his good angel to come out with him indicated to Simon his approach ing death. For, had the angel achieved his purpose, which was to obtain for him pardon and a decree of life, he would have come out with him as he was accustomed to do in all the preced ing years. But the Palestinians also took it for granted that the person dressed in white, who entered with Simon, was an angel. For, in their question to R. Abbahu, some people express their</page><page sequence="17">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 189 surprise at the angels entering with the High Priest into the Holy of Holies. They quote an old Midrash,15 which interpreted the passage "and there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the Holy place" (Levit. XVI, 17), to mean that even those about whom it is written "as for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man" (Ezechiel I, 10), that is to say even angels, were not allowed to be there. R. Abbahu, however, gives them the following remarkable answer: "What (or who) tells me, that it was a man (or an angel whose likeness is that of a man) ? I say it was the Holy One, blessed be He."16 R. Abbahu's answer unmistakably refers to 15 I am unable to trace this Midrash to its source. I believe that it origi nated with R. Akiba and that the questioners, who merely refer to it but do not quote it in full, did not understand its real meaning. In Sifra,Vayikra, Nedabah II (Weiss4ab), after the sayings of R. Akiba and others to the effect that the voice of God that was heard in the Tabernacle came out from between the two Cherubim upon the Ark-cover, there follows another Midrash by R. Akiba and Ben Azzai to the words כי לא יראני האדם וחי (Exodus XXXIII, 21), interpreting them to mean that even angels could not see God. This Midrash simply meant to remove the anthropomorphic concep tion, as if God could at all be visible (cp. Geiger, Osar Nehmad, III, p. 10). R. Akiba thus seeks to make the revelation in the Tabernacle resemble the revelation on Sinai about which it is said: "Ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only a voice" (Deut. IV, 12). He declares that in the Tabernacle, likewise, there was actually heard the voice of God but no visible manifestation of the Deity was to be seen. The same tendency was also followed in the Mid rash on the words יכל אדם לא יהיה באהל referred to here. It likewise sought to combat the popular belief that in the Holy of Holies there was visible the presence of God surrounded by angels. The later people, however, misunder stood the meaning of this Midrash as well as the meaning of the other Midrash of Akiba. They understood the latter to mean, not that God was absolutely invisible, but that the angels were not allowed to look at Him; and the Midrash on the passage וכל אדם לא יהיה באהל they understood to mean that the angels were not allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies because God was visible there and they were not allowed to look at Him. See the following note. 16 As far as I could ascertain, all the commentators as well as Tosafot to Menahot, 109b s.v. נזדמן, R. Moses Taku in כתב תמים (Oçar Nehmad III, p. 60), and even R. Jacob ibn Habib (in הכותב to En Jakob) and R. Samuel Jaffe Ashkenazi (in his יפה מראה ad loc.) take this answer of R. Abbahu literally to mean that it was God Himself who in the appearance of an old man entered with Simon into the Holy of Holies. Yet one can hardly believe that a teacher like R. Abbahu could have seriously given expression to such a crude, anthro pomorphic, almost blasphemous, idea about God. It is true, that R. Abbahu</page><page sequence="18">190 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH the belief that God was in the Holy of Holies and that a repre sentation of Him could even be seen by the High Priest. The question addressed to R. Abbahu as well as the Babylonian version of the Baraita further indicate the belief that the angels or even Satan would also be present there. This belief is also alluded to in the following Talmudic reports which have direct reference to the controversy between the two parties. In Yoma 19b we read the following report: ת"ר מעשה בצדוקי elsewhere (B. B. 25a) speaks of the Shekinah as being in the West, probably meaning in the western part of the Temple, i.e. in the Holy of Holies. Further in Sanhédrin (95b) he reports a legend as to how God appeared to King Sennaherib in the appearance of an old man. But there is a great difference between telling a legend, or speaking of the Shekinah as being in the West, and making a statement to students or in a discussion with people who ask a serious question. Possibly, this answer of Abbahu is not to be taken literally. Had he really wished to say that it was God Himself who entered with Simon into the Holy of Holies, he could have briefly stated הקביה הוה. The form of his answer admits the following interpretation. He says to them: "According to your reasoning, which takes the Midrash to mean that the angels, who according to the literal meaning of a passage in Ezechiel have the appearance of man, were also included in the prohibition that no man be in the Holy of Holies, I could could answer you (אני אומר) that it was God Himself who, in a passage in Daniel (VII, 9), is pictured as "the ancient of days sitting upon the throne in raiment white as snow, etc." But, of course, you cannot take these passages in Ezechiel and Daniel literally, nor must you take this legend about Simon, which may likewise merely report a vision which Simon had (cp. Isserless in ToratTorat ha-Olah, quoted by R. Enoch Zundel in his commentary ענף יוסף to En Jakob a.l.). literally. What suggests this interpretation of Abbahu's saying, is the fact that in Pesikta d. R. Kahana (Buber 178a) andin Levit. R. (XXI, 12), after this answer of Abbahu is quoted, there follows another quite different saying of Abbahu. It reads thus: וכהן גדול לאו אדם הוא. "And was not the High Priest a man?" By this R. Abbahu evidently meant to say that if we should understand this Midrash to mean that because God was in the Holy of Holies no man, not even angels, who are like man, were allowed to enter there, then the High Priest could never have been allowed to enter there. Of course, this saying of Abbahu was also misunderstood by the author of the Pesikta and by the redactor of Levit. R. who followed him (see Lauterbach, Jewish Encyclo pedia,pedia, XII, p. 478-79). They took it simply as a question, how could the High Priest be admitted to enter the Holy of Holies? They answered it by explaining that the High Priest was like an angel, not realizing that, according to the Midrashic interpretation of the words וכל אדם לא יהיה באהל, as Abbahu's questioners understood it, even angels were not allowed to enter there.</page><page sequence="19">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 191 אחד שהתקין מבהוץ והכניס ביציאתו היה שמח שמחה גדולה פגע בו אביו אמר לו בני אף על פי שצדוקין אנו מתייראין אנו מן הפרושים אמר לו כל ימי הייתי מצטער על המקרא הזה כי בענן אראה על הכפורת אמרתי מתי יבוא לידי ואקיימנו עכשיו שבא לידי לא אקיימנו.אקיימנו. There is no reason whatever to doubt the historicity of this report, which is also found in P. Yoma I, 5 (39a). It shows that the Sadducees attached great importance to their interpretation of Levit. XVI, 12, and that they would seek to perform the cere mony according to their own practice, even after the Pharisees had control over the Temple service and were in a position to dictate to the High Priest the instructions for performing his functions. But, following this authentic report, there are given in both the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmudim legendary reports about the punishment which this Sadducean High Priest suffered for his daring to follow the Sadducean practice. The P. Talmud has two different accounts of what happened to this Sadducean High Priest. One account merely reports that he died a few days after the Day of Atonement, but does not specify what manner of death it was, hence it may have been a natural death. But the other report says that when coming out from the Holy of Holies, after having offered the incense, his nose was discharging worms and right in the center of his forehead there was a mark like that of a calf's hoof. We are not told whether and how soon he died as a result of these injuries. But it was understood that both these disfiguring marks on the face of the High Priest were the results of the injuries which he received from the angel in the Holy of Holies. The angel, the soles of whose feet (according to Ezechiel I, 7) are like the sole of a calf's foot, kicked the High Priest and hit him squarely in the middle of his forehead right above his nose. The result was that his nose discharged worms17 and his forehead still showed the impression of the angel's foot. That it was so understood even by the Pal estinians is evident from the discussion that follows in the same 17 That the smiting of an angel would have the effect of producing worms, that would eat up the body and cause death, is also assumed in the story about the death of Herod Agrippa as told in Acts XII, 23: "And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him because he gave not God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and gave up the ghost."</page><page sequence="20">192 JACOB 2. LAUTERBACH paragraph of the Yerushalmi, the report about the affliction of the High Priest. R. Abbahu, who, as we have seen above, in the discussion of the legend about Simon the Just admits only the presence of God, but denies the presence of angels in the Holy of Holies, was asked to explain this legendary report about the Sadducean High Priest. The questioners ask him how it was possible that the Sadducean High Priest received injuries from an angel in the Holy of Holies when, according to the law in Lev. XVI, 7 as interpreted by an old Midrash, the angels were not allowed to be in the Holy of Holies at the time when the High Priest entered there. In this case R. Abbahu does not say, as in the case of the legend about Simon the Just, that it may be that God Himself inflicted these injuries upon the Sadducean High Priest. R. Abbahu implicitly admits that these injuries came from an angel, the sign of the calf's foot being indisputable evidence for that. But, says R. Abbahu, the angel was not in the Holy of Holies for he was not allowed to be there. He was standing at the entrance to the Holy of Holies and it was rather when the High Priest sought to enter the Holy of Holies in his Sadducean manner בשעה שהוא נכנס כדרכו, i.e.1S carrying the smoking incense in front of him, that the angel hit him. 18 This seems to me to be the correct meaning of the phrase בשעה שהוא נכנס כדרכו. The interpretations given by the commentators do not make good sense. The author of קרבן העדה gives the following interpretation : בשעה שהוא נכנס כדרכו ומק"ם מעות העבודה כתיקונו הוא דאסור לכל אדם להיות שם אבל זה שלא עשה כתיקונו מותרים להיות שם (cp. Tosafot Yeshanim to Yoma, a.l., who give the same interpretation). This practically assumes that the angels are in the Holy of Holies and only when the High Priest performs the ceremony correctly (כתיקונו) does he succeed in driving them away. Even less satisfactory is the interpretation given by the commentator פני משה which reads as follows: בשעה שהוא נכנס כדרכו לא היה זה בשעה שבא לכפר אלא בשעה שנכנס כדרכו להוציא את הכף והמחתה. This interpretation stresses the words בבואו לכפר בקדש taking them to mean that only at the moment when the High Priest entered to obtain forgiveness were the angels not allowed to be there but before and after that time they could be, and actually were, in the Holy of Holies. This explains only why the angel did not smite the High Priest at the moment when he performed the ceremony. But why did he not smite him outside, immediately when he came out after having wrongly performed the ceremony. Why did the angel have to go into the Holy of Holies and there lie in wait for the High Priest till he came in again to take out the pan and the spoon?</page><page sequence="21">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 193 The Babylonian Talmud also has two accounts of what hap pened to the Sadducean High Priest, but they are different from the reports given by the Palestinians. Here we read as follows: אמרו לא היו ימים מועטים עד שמת והוטל באשפה והיו תולעין יוצאין מחוטמו ויש אומרים ביציאתו ניגף דחני רבי חייא כמין קול נשמע בעזרה שבא מלאך וחבטו על פניו ונכנםו אחיו הכהנים ומצאו ככף רגל עגל בין כתפיו שנאמר ורגליהם רגל ישרה וכף רגליהם ככף רגל עגל. One is tempted to believe that the Babylonians knew the Pales tinian reports as well as the difficulty raised by the questioners of R. Abbahu and the latter's answer, but they did not find this answer satisfactory. For, if the angel was not in the Holy of Holies but hit the High Priest on his forehead before he entered the Holy of Holies, it is difficult to believe that the High Priest could nevertheless have proceeded into the Holy of Holies and have performed the ceremony there. The angel surely must have dealt the High Priest a blow from which he could not recover. The Babylonians therefore offer another report which presents no difficulty. The High Priest performed the ceremony in his own way since nothing happened to him when he entered. But, after having performed the cermony and retired from the Holy of Holies, he was smitten by the angel as he came out of the Holy of Holies (ביציאתו ניגף). The angel, who hit him, was not in the Holy of Holies. He came from outside. Indeed, some sort of a noise was heard in the Temple court, which was the noise of the angel rushing in to punish the offender. The High Priest, when he came out from the Holy of Holies, walked backward, so as not to turn his back upon the Holy of Holies (see Yoma 52b and 53a). When he reached the threshold and his back had just emerged from behind the curtain, the angel, who was outside of the curtain, kicked him on his back between the shoulders, and threw him down with his face to the ground. The High Priest fell forward, hitting the floor of the Holy of Holies with his face. He did not recover from this blow; he lay there till his fellow priests came and pulled him out. They then found between his shoulders a mark which looked like a calf's foot. This was proof that an angel, the sole of whose foot is according to Ezechiel 1,7, like the sole of a calf's foot, had kicked him. But if he was hit on his back and not on his forehead right over his nose, then the</page><page sequence="22">194 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH discharge of worms from his nose, of which an old legend spoke, could not have been the result of the injury received from the angel's blow. The Babylonian report, therefore, does not say that immediately when brought out from the Holy of Holies, they saw worms coming out from his nose. The Babylonians combine the legend about the worms coming out from his nose with the other report, that he died a few days after the Day of Atonement. The worms came out from his nose because his body was thrown upon a dunghill, not having been given a decent burial. I have discussed these Talmudic legends at length, in order to show how all of them clearly point to, if they do not expressly state, the primitive belief about the visible presence of the Deity in the Holy of Holies, entertained by the people even during the time of the second Temple. Of course, the enlightened teachers sought to suppress or at least modify these primitive notions, but they did not succeed in entirely removing them from the popular mind ; hence we find allusions to these superstitions even in the later Aggadic expressions of the Talmud. It was the attitude towards these primitive beliefs, which brought about the strong controversy in regard to the offering of the incense. The real issue in this controversy was a very important doctrine, a fundamental principle in regard to the God conception. The difference of opinion between the two parties in regard to the preparation of the incense was based upon different theological viewpoints. We can understand the position of each party in this controversy, if we consider its general religious outlook and theological doctrines. We must remember that the Sadducees were the conserva tive priestly group, holding on to the older doctrines and beliefs, and cherishing the highest regard for the sacrificial cult of the Temple. They retained many of the primitive notions both about God and the purpose of the service offered to Him in the Temple. They were strongly opposed to any reform in the sac rificial functions of the Temple in which they were so vitally interested and the performance of which had always been their special privilege. The Pharisees, on the other hand, were the progressive liberal group of lay teachers, the spiritual successors</page><page sequence="23">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 195 of the prophets, with a purer God conception and less regard for the sacrificial cult. While not entirely opposed to the sacrificial cult as such, they sought to reform it. They tried as much as it was in their power to democratize and spiritualize the service in the Temple and to remove from it, as far as possible, the elements of crude superstition and primitive outworn conceptions.1' In the controversy about the preparation of the incense each party is true to its character. Their respective positions were in perfect agreement with their respective theological views and religious tendencies. The Talmudic reports about this con troversy present no difficulty. They are not as full and as plain as we would have liked them to be, but by their presentation of the arguments of the two parties, especially if we read between the lines, as well as by their omissions, they clearly indicate what the real reasons were that prompted the two parties to take their respective stands in this controversy. The Sadducees, as conservative priests, retained and cher ished the popular beliefs and primitive notions associated with the Temple and especially with the most sacred place in it, the Holy of Holies. In their service in the Temple, and especially when performing the most solemn rites on the most holy day in the most holy place, they would, therefore, follow strictly the old traditional practice and would not dare to make any change in its ritual. According to the primitive notions held by them, the entrance of the High Priest into the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement was not only a great privilege, offering the rare opportunity of catching a glimpse of the Deity, but was also 1י See Lauterbach, "The Sadducees and Pharisees" in Studies in Jewish Literature,Literature, Berlin 1913. The whole attitude of the Sadducees toward the authority of the Law was based upon a primitive conception and superstition about the binding power of the oath. The Pharisees, however, considered the Law authoritative because of the Divine truth it contained. Dr. Jacob Mann calls my attention to Acts XXIII, 8, where it is said: For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both." But this is hardly a correct presentation of the Sadducean position. The Sadducees may have denied resurrection, but they certainly did not deny the existence of angels and of Satan, at tested to by many passages in the Bible.</page><page sequence="24">196 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH fraught with great dangers.20 There was, in the first place, the danger that he might, even if only involuntarily, look the Deity straight into the face, and, as a result, immediately die; for no man can see the Deity and remain alive. There was also the danger of Satan following him into the Holy of Holies and accuse him there before God. This also might prove disastrous for him. He might be found guilty and punished with immediate death, or, as in the case of Simon the Just, be sentenced to die during the year. All possible precautions had therefore to be taken to protect the High Priest against these dangers, to help him in the successful performance of his function and to secure his coming out unharmed from the trial which he had to face. The old practice of preparing the incense outside of the Holy of Holies and producing a pillar of smoke before bringing it in to offer to the Deity, was a very effective measure of precaution. It afforded the High Priest protection from both dangers that faced him. The smoke coming up from the incense which he carried in his hand protected him from the danger of Satan's accusations. For, Satan, frightened and driven away by the smoke, could not follow him into the Holy of Holies into the very presence of God." The 50 Cp. Mishnah Yoma V, 2 לא היה מאריך בתפלתו כדי שלא להבעית את ישראל and VII, 4 ויום טוב היה עושה לאוהביו בשעה שיצא בשלוב מן הקדש. 21 Smoke as such was considered an effective means of driving away Satan and the evil spirits. See Lauterbach, "The Ceremony of Breaking a Glass at Weddings," in Hebrew Union College Annual, II, p. 356-357. The smoke of incense was especially powerful in driving away Satan. This belief has sur vived to this day in a popular proverb, current among Eastern Jews, who when wishing to describe the horror a person has for something, they say: "He is afraid of it as Satan is afraid of Weihrauch {i.e. smoke of incense)." This belief is very old. According to a legend in the Talmud (Sabbath 89a) it was Satan himself (or the Angel of Death who is identical with Satan ; cp. the saying in B. B. 16a הוא שטן הוא יצר הרע הוא מלאך המות) who in a generous moment gave away his secret to Moses, telling him that the smoke of incense has the power of stopping his pernicious activities. Thus Moses knew how to put a halt to the activities of the Angel of Death when the plague broke out among the people. He sent Aaron with the pan of smoking incense into the midst of the assembly. "And Aaron stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed" (see Numbers XVII, 11-13). Cp. also Tanhuma, 15 תצוה, and Zohar, Vayera 100b-101a, and Phinehas 244. Incidentally we notice here that all the three methods of dealing with the evil spirits, usually employed by the people (see the essay on "The Ceremony</page><page sequence="25">A A A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 197 smoke coming up from the incense also protected him from the dan ger of seeing the Deity clearly face to face. 11 formed a sort of screen through which he was allowed to look at the Deity, for "through the smoke of the incense God may be seen upon the Ark-cover." This old practice of preparing the incense outside was, therefore, of the utmost importance for the High Priest. It protected him from the accuser, it prevented him from incurring the penalty of death by involuntarily looking the Deity in the face, and at the same time it afforded him the rare privilege of catching a glimpse of God, of seeing Him, if only dimly, through the screen of smoke. The position of the Sadducees in our controversy was therefore perfectly logical. It was consistent with their theological views and with the primitive notions which they held. Their argu ments in favor of the old practice, in so far as they are reported by the Baraita in Sifra and in the Palestinian Tamud, clearly point to these primitive theological views and are quite sound. Their first argument, the argument of propriety unmistakably points to their belief that God is present in the Holy of Holies. They say, since God is present behind the curtain in the Holy of Holies, it would be disrespectful to prepare the incense there in His very presence. Their second argument, the one from the words כי בענן אראה על הכפורת, expresses even more strongly their belief in God's presence in the Holy of Holies. God can be seen upon the Ark-cover, but he may be seen only through a screen of smoke; hence that screen of smoke must be prepared outside, so that at the very moment of entering the Holy of Holies, the High Priest if he should involuntarily look in the direction of the Ark-cover would see God only through the screen of smoke. The Baraita does not tell us that the Sadducees also pointed out the of Breaking a Glass at Weddings," I.e.) were also employed by the High Priest in order to ward off the danger that threatened him from Satan. The white garments were used to deceive Satan, making him believe that the High Priest was one of the angels (see note 11). But there was still the fear lest Satan see through the deception, hence the second method, the one of bribing him, was also used. A gift was sent to Satan in the goat of Azazel (see Pirke d. R. Eliezer 46). But the wicked one was not to be trusted. He might seek to harm the High Priest, even after having received the bribe, hence the third method of fighting him and driving him away by the smoke of the incense was resorted to.</page><page sequence="26">198 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH danger from Satan which could be warded off by their practice. But this need not surprise us. The author of the Baraita may have hesitated to even mention this superstition. More likely, however, he omitted mentioning it because he was not interested in reporting all the arguments of the Sadducees. For this reason also he does not report how the Sadducees met the Pharisees' argument from the syntactic order of the two verses 12-13 which, pointing to consecutive actions, would apparently demand that he put the incense upon the fire after he had entered the Holy of Holies. From the very fact that, as we have seen, the Pharisees did not stress very much this argument of theirs, we may conclude that they themselves did not consider it an irre futable proof in favor of their position. The Sadducees must have interpreted these two verses in such a manner as to favor their position. The Pharisees must have felt that the Sadducean interpretation of these two verses was as sound as their own ; hence they did not stress the argument based upon their own interpretation of these two verses. Of course, we need not expect the Pharisaic sources to tell us what the Sadducean interpretation was, especially when it was considered as quite sound. We are left to guess what this interpretation was, and it is not so difficult to guess. The Sadducees, I believe, admitted that the syntactic order of the two verses 12-13 prescribed consecutive actions. The action prescribed in verse 13 was to take place after the action of bringing in the incense and the fire into the Holy of Holies, prescribed in verse 12. But they interpreted the two actions in their own way. The action prescribed in verse 12 was, according to their interpretation, not to carry the incense in one hand and the fire in the other and thus enter the Holy of Holies, as the Pharisees said. It was to bring in the smoking incense, i.e., the incense and the fire together into the Holy of Holies. And the action, prescribed in verse 13 to be performed after the high-priest had entered the Holy of Holies, was not to put the incense upon the fire, as the Pharisees claimed. This had already been done, for he had brought in the smoking incense. The action prescribed</page><page sequence="27">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 199 in verse 13 was to place before God the incense, which was already upon the fire, that is, to put the pan of fiery coals with the smoking incense on it in front of the Deity." The Pharisees with their purer God conception were opposed to superstitious notions and primitive beliefs fostered by the conservative priests. They were consistent in their belief in the Divine Omnipresence. God is everywhere, the whole world is full of His glory and no one place is more favored with His près ence than any other. Accordingly, they denied that God or any visible representation of Him, or any visible manifestation of His Glory could actually be seen in the Holy of Holies hovering over the Ark-cover, or, in the Second Temple when the Ark was no more, on the Stone (אבן שתיה). They sought to teach the people this purer God conception and were opposed to any teach ing or practice which might present to the people a false concep tion of God or confirm them in their old superstition. They objected to the manner in which the High Priest had been accus tomed to perform the ceremony of offering the incense on the Day of Atonement, for no other reason than that this old prac tice tended to perpetuate crude primitive superstitions and to give the people a false conception of God. They accordingly, sought to modify this ceremony, at least to remove from it those features which emphasized the crude superstitions. They advo cated a radical reform in the performance of this ceremony which would make it much more compatible with their advanced ideas about God. They had no old tradition to back them in their war against superstition, unless it were that the teachings of the prophets of old helped them in forming their ideas about God and determined their attitude towards the sacrificial cult in general. But ancient custom and traditional practice were against them in this specific case. Neither did they have any express state ment in the written Law to support them in this fight. They did not have a strong case ; they had only a good cause, the cause of advanced religious thought and correct ideas about God. On the positive side of their arguments, they are weak. They have "" See D. Hoffmann, Das Buck Leviticus, p. 446. The interpretation sug gested by N. Briill, Bet Talmud, I, (Wien 1881), p. 243, is forced and gram matically impossible.</page><page sequence="28">200 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH not one strong positive proof in favor of their position. Even their one positive Scriptural proof from the syntactic order of the two verses 12-13 in Lev. XVI, was, as we have seen, also not unassailable. On the positive side they have only their strong religious convictions to support them. They are, however, negatively strong, as they can show that the arguments of their opponents are not absolutely convincing. In their dispute they, accordingly, limit themselves merely to the task of refuting their opponents' arguments. To the first argument of their opponents, the argument of propriety, they reply by citing the Scriptural passage from Lev. XVI. 13, והלא כבר נאמר ונתן את הקטורת על האש לפני ה'. By this they do not insist that the words 'לפני ה, "before the Lord," designate the Holy of Holies. This, as we have seen, their oppo nents also admit, except that they claim that the incense, after it had been put upon the fire, should be placed before the Lord in the Holy of Holies. The Pharisees merely say: "But is it not said 'and he should put the incense upon the fire in the presence of the Lord.' " By this they clearly mean : even if, as you say, he puts the incense upon the fire outside of the curtain, he does it also in the presence of the Lord. For right in the preceding verse ולקח מלא המחתה גחלי אש מעל המזבח מלפני ה', the place of the altar outside of the curtain is also designated as 'מלפני ה, in the presence of the Lord. Hence, no matter where he prepares the incense, he would be doing it in the presence of God and this according to your rea soning would be disrespectful. It is for this reason, that, as we have already noticed, they do not close their argument with the phrase מלמד שאינו נותן אלא מבפנים, for they did not cite this passage as a positive proof for their position. They merely cited it as a a negative proof to show how absurd their opponents' argument was in comparing God, who is everywhere, to a human being who can only be in one place and does not notice what is done in another place. The second argument of their opponents which seeks to prove from the words כי בענן אראה על הכפורת that God is present upon the Ark-cover and may be seen through the smoke, they refute by rejecting their opponents' interpretation of this Scrip tural passage. They did not want to interpret this passage to</page><page sequence="29">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 201 mean "with a cloud of Glory will I appear on the Ark-cover," as the ancient versions understood it.23 For this would admit that some visible representation of the Deity is present in the Holy of Holies and the High Priest might well seek to shield himself so as not to look at it directly. They insisted that neither in a corporeal form, nor in an ethereal apparition, nor in a fiery mani festation can the Deity be seen in the Holy of Holies. They, therefore, admit that the word בענן in this passage refers to the smoke of the incense. The Scriptural passage does imply that a smoke-producing ingredient must be mixed in with the incense, but it does not say anything about God's being seen through the smoke. The Pharisees probably read אראה, instead of אראה, and they interpreted the passage to mean "through the smoke I look down upon the Ark-cover and see whether the ceremony of offering the incense there, which I commanded, has been correctly " Cp. Geiger in 0$ar Nehmad, I.e. Geiger is not correct in his statement that the ancient versions follow in this case the younger Halakah. The ver sions here represent but the first attempt of the early Halakah to combat the superstitious beliefs. In this first attempt the Halakah contented itself with merely removing the crude anthromoporphic conception, while still admitting that some ethereal manifestation of the Deity could be visible on the Ark. But the Pharisaic Halakah soon went further and denied even the presence of a cloud of glory or of any other visible manifestation upon the Ark-cover. The opinions of R. Judah and the Hakamim (Menaljot 27b, cp. also Sifra, Aliare Mot I, Weiss 80b), which according to Geiger reflect the younger Halakah, do not admit that any visible manifestation of the Deity was present upon the Ark, as Geiger erroneously assumes (see Jùdische Zeitschrift, II, (Breslau 1863), p. 29-31). On the contrary, they further emphasize the Pharisaic denial of such a Presence by indicating that the Holy of Holies was not the only place, which the priests were forbidden to enter, but that other parts of the Temple were also so forbidden, though the penalty for entering the other parts was not so severe as the penalty for entering the Holy of Holies. But just as the forty stripes which one receives for violating the prohibition of entering the Hekal are a penalty inflicted upon him and not a direct consequence of his entering, so also the death mentioned in the Torah for entering the Holy of Holies is likewise a penalty inflicted upon the High Priest and not a direct consequence of his having seen the Deity, for the Deity is in no manner visible there. They thus make it clear that the prohibition to enter the Holy of Holies was not because of the presence of the Deity there. It was just one of many laws regulating the entrance of the priests into the various parts of the Temple, the reasons for which we do not know. See note 25.</page><page sequence="30">202 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH performed."24 They sought to reduce the ceremony of offering the incense in the Holy of Holies to a mere ritual חקה, like so many other ritual laws prescribed in the Torah, which we must observe because prescribed by God, though we do not know the reason why God commanded them, but must not seek to explain on the basis of superstitions, or as suggesting to us false beliefs.25 The Pharisaic teachers themselves, however, must have detected a certain weakness in this refutation of the Sadducean argument based upon the words כי בענן אראה על הכפורת. The weak point was the admission on the part of the Pharisees that the word בענן means "through the smoke of the incense" and that the passage teaches the requirement of mixing in מעלה עשן with the incense. This requirement of a smoke-producing ingredient in the incense rather helps the Sadducees, for it suggests that it was necessary to produce a screen of smoke. Some of the teachers wondered why the Pharisees make this admission as to the meaning of the word בענן in this passage, when they could just as well have interpreted the passage to mean, through the clouds do I look down from heaven, and omit any reference to the smoke of the incense and the suggestion of the necessity of a screen of smoke 24 Or, "I will see the smoke which is covering the Ark." I admit that this is merely a guess but I believe it is a good guess. The Pharisees must have given some such interpretation to this verse, namely that God will see the ceremony performed, the smoke covering the Ark, and because of this He will forgive them their sins. Cp. the interpretation given to the words וראיתי את הדם in Mekilta Pislja VII, (Friedmann 8a). This idea is also reflected in the Midrashic interpretation to the words וכסה ענן הקטרת as meaning that the smoke of the incense will have the effect of covering, so to speak, the sins, hiding them and forgiving them. See Tanhuma, 15 תצוה and Kohelet R. IV, 6 and the remarks of רד"ל there. 25 Cp. the refusal of R. Yoljanan b. Zakkai to look for any reason for the ritual of purification by the water of sprinkling (Numbers XIX) other than that it was so decreed by God, גזירתו של מלך מלכי המלכים הוא. אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא חוקה חקקתי נזירה גזרתי אין ארם רשאי לעבור על גזירתי (Peseta d. R. Kahana, Parah, 40b). To observe a ceremony without asking for any reason but merely because one believes it to be prescribed by God, has some religious significance and is of disciplinary value. To seek to explain the ceremony by accepting the superstitious beliefs which may have motivated its origin is religiously harmful.</page><page sequence="31">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 203 to hide something visible in the Holy of Holies.26 This difficulty is expressed in the Baraita by the question ומנין שהוא נותן בה מעלה עשן, whence do we know that it was necessary to mix in מעלה עשן, or in other words, why admit that there was any smoke at all? In answer to this question, hinting at the difficulty in the Pharisaic answer, the Baraita cites the passage וכסה ענן הקטורת את הכפורת אשר על העדות ולא ימות ימות, which clearly prescribes, as a specific feature of the ceremony, the covering of the Ark-cover with the smoke of the incense. But lest it be argued that this very passage "that the cloud of the incense cover the Ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not" suggests that some 36 In some of the sayings of the Rabbis we can discern a tendency to deny the absolute necessity of מעלה עשן in the קטרת. In the first place מעלה עשן is not counted among the eleven ingredients necessary for the קטרת (Keritot 6ab) and we are told in the Midrash (Cant. R. I, 14) that it was not good for the קטרת to contain more than these eleven specified ingredients, מיכן בדקו חכמים ומצאו שאין יפה לקטרת אלא אחד עשר סממנים הללו בלבד. It is true that the Baraita in Keritot 6a, after enumerating the eleven ingredients, adds that three other things (not ingredients, see Rashi there, s.v. שס־ח מנים) were also used in the preparation of the קטרת, viz. יין קפריסין ,בוריה כרשינה, and מעלה עשן but it reduces the latter to a minimum, saying that the least quantity of it (כל שהוא) was sufficient. Furthermore, the Baraita goes on to explain for what purpose the other two, i.e. בוריה כרשינה and יין קפריסין (or in the absence of of the latter חמר חוריין, or מלח סדומית, or כפת הירדן, see comment of R. Moses Cohen quoted in Tosafot there, s.v. פלח סדומית) were used in the process of the קטרת, but does not tell us for what the מעלה עשן was used. Evidently the author of the Baraita hesitated to state that the מעלה עשן was used to produce a screen of smoke. And by stating that only a neglible quantity of it was used, the Baraita suggests that the requirement of מעלה עשן was really not essential. By this the Baraita meant to remove the last vestige of the idea that a screen of smoke was necessary to prevent the High Priest from seeing the Deity. Perhaps the statement of R. Simon b. Gamaliel in the Baraita (P. Yoma IV, 5), או שנתן לתוכה מעלה עשן חייב פיתה, really expresses this opposition on the part of some teachers to the use of מעלה עשן in the קטרת. For no matter how one may try to explain its presence in the קטרת, it still suggests the belief or gives the impression that a screen of smoke was necessary to hide the visible Deity from the eyes of the High Priest. We have no valid reason for correcting the text, as is suggested by the commentator קרבן העדה when he says: ה'נ או שלא נתן לתוכה מעלה עשן חייב מיתה. He has no Ms. variant nor any older source to warrant this correction. He is merely prompted by the desire to harmonize the saying of R. Simon b. Gamaliel with the other sayings in the Talmud which assume the requirement of מעלה עשן in the קטרת.</page><page sequence="32">204 JACOB Z. LAUTERBACH divine manifestation was present upon the Ark-cover and that the High Priest might die as a result of seeing it unless covered by the smoke of the incense, the Baraita wisely and purposely states הא אם לא נתן בה מעלה עשן או שהיסה אחת מכל סממניה חייב מיתה. By this the Baraita indicates that the words ולא ימות do not mean "lest he die" as a result of seeing the manifestation of the Deity. These words mean "so that he may not incur the penalty of death." For the omission of any ingredient of the incense, not only of the מעלה עשן, was an offense punishable by death. And to further prove that the מעלה עשן was just one of the prescribed ingredients of the incense, but was not intended for the purpose of screening the High Priest or covering any manifestation of the Deity, they declared that even the incense which was offered every day, not in the Holy of Holies, but on the altar in the Hekal, where even according to the popular beliefs there was no visible manifestation of the Deity, must also contain the smoke producing ingredients. They thus declared the מעלה עשן to be merely one of the essential ingredients of the incense and removed the possibility of interpreting its requirement in the incense offered in the Holy of Holies to be for any special purpose. The above study reveals the great significance of this con troversy between the two ancient parties. It also explains why the reports about this controversy do not explicitly state the reasons which prompted each party to take its particular stand on this question. We can well understand why the Pharisaic teachers hesitated to discuss openly and plainly the issue involved in this controversy. They did not wish to mention expressly and publicly the false beliefs which they were fighting even when they could present their refutations of them. They feared that the mentioning of these beliefs, even together with their réfuta tions, would result in advertising them. For, to use a Talmudic phrase, איכא השמע בהא ולא שמע בהא, some people might willingly listen to the presentation of these false beliefs and then refuse or neglect to listen also to the refutations. This was all the more to be feared, since the Pharisaic rejection of these popular beliefs involved also a rejection or a forced interpretation of many Biblical passages which speak in anthropomorphic terms of the presence of God in the Temple or in the Holy of Holies upon the</page><page sequence="33">A SIGNIFICANT CONTROVERSY 205 Ark-cover. They therefore sought rather to suppress these superstitious notions, believing that in such cases the dictum of the sage כבוד אלהים הסחר דבר, "It is for the glory of God to conceal a thing" (Prov. XXV, 2), is well applicable. That their appre hensions were not unfounded has been proved by the subsequent development. Not all the Rabbis in later generations could rise to the lofty heights of the early Pharisaic teachers. The super stitious beliefs and primitive notions, which the early teachers sought to fight and suppress, survived among the Jewish people; and echoes of them are found in Rabbinic literature. And while the later Rabbis of the Talmud, when speaking about God in the terms of these ancient primitive beliefs, use these terms only figuratively and in an allegorical sense, yet there were some people in Talmudic and in post-Talmudic times who took them quite literally. The priestly superstitions have not yet died out entirely even among the Jews.</page></plain_text>
