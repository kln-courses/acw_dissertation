<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> NINE  The Early Metal Phase: A Protohistoric  Transition toward Supra-Tribal Societies  The early Metal (or Paleometallic) phase correlates with the introduction of new  technologies and trade items to the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago from Vietnam- ese, Indian, and Chinese sources. In addition, it overlaps chronologically with  and merges into the period of the developing Indianized states during the first  millennium AD. In this sense it seems quite reasonable to regard it as basically  protohistoric.  However, the difficulties attending any attempt to gauge the real significance  of this phase are considerable. Most of the older reports contain little more than  lists of undated artifacts, and the major cultural changes presumed to have  taken place at this time remain virtually undocumented. My own research in  Sabah and eastern Indonesia has provided a partial chronology for certain local- ized and regional aspects of the phase as a whole, but the vast bulk of the archi- pelago has not yet received the attention it deserves and it is still very difficult  for Southeast Asian archaeologists to gain access to radiocarbon dating facilities.  Perhaps the best contribution to future studies this chapter can make will be to  review the material in related groups that can in certain cases be elevated to the  status of localized archaeological cultures.  The early Metal phase commenced with the introduction of copper-bronze!  and iron artifacts and their manufacturing technologies, presumably together  (there is no separate "Bronze Age") and almost certainly from immediate sources  on the Southeast Asian mainland during the last few centuries Be. I will take  500 BC as an arbitrary starting point, although I personally do not feel that any  metal in the archipelago can be conclusively dated as early as this; future  research may push this date closer to 200 BC. Artifacts and assemblages attrib- uted to this phase of course exclude those that can unequivocally be associated  268  </page> <page sequence="2"> The Early Metal Phase 269  with the historical Indianized or Islamic states, although many assemblages  considered to be "Bronze-Iron Age" in the terminology of Heekeren (1958) could  quite easily be fully historical in this sense. However, this is usually hard to  prove owing to poor documentation and dating. It should be emphasized that  pre-Indianized styles of metal and other artifacts undoubtedly continued in  production well after the first appearance of Indian bronzes and inscriptions in  the archipelago, and for many of the remoter eastern regions and Borneo it  would be quite acceptable to continue the early Metal phase into ethnographic  times, as in the case of the small bronze drums (moko) of Javanese or Balinese  manufacture used in Alor (Du Bois 1944). For practical reasons such a diffuse- ness of ending might cause this chapter to lengthen into another book, so I will  draw an arbitrary termination at AD 1000 and thus leave the archaeology of the  China trade, Islam, and the Malay sultanates out of consideration.  I. THE DONG SON CULTURE OF NORTHERN VIETNAM  Bronze working in northern Vietnam commenced around the middle of the  second millennium BC and is associated with the Dong Dau and succeeding Go  Mun phases of Vietnamese archaeologists (Ha Van Tan 1980; Hoang and Bui  1980; Higham 1989; Higham 1996b). Together with central and northeastern  Thailand, this region has the earliest evidence for bronze working in Southeast  Asia and in recent years there has been considerable discussion about the origins  of the tradition, which has no preceding copper phase. Ultimate origins are of  no real concern for an understanding of Island Southeast Asian prehistory, and  because the issue is by no means resolved it will not be followed here. However,  the types of bronze artifacts involved in the millennium prior to 500 BC include  socketed axes and spearheads, shaft-hole sickles (in Vietnam), tanged spear- heads and arrowheads, and other small items such as knives, fishhooks, and  bracelets. At some time between 500 and 300 BC, according to recent carbon  dates, the classic Dong Son phase of Vietnamese protohistory began, with its  bronze drums, high-status burials, and the first appearance of iron.  The Dong Son archaeological assemblages are of considerable importance  because the earliest metal goods found in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago are  generally of this type, rather than of direct Indian or Chinese inspiration.  Bronzes of Dong Son style are found widely in Mainland Southeast Asia and  southern China, but stylistic and compositional homogeneity, especially of the  drums, suggests an outstanding dominance of Dong Son workshops on north- ern Vietnamese soil at this time. 2 The drums are of Heger type I (Plate 45) and  the finest and oldest examples found in Vietnam have remarkable decorative  friezes of human, animal, and geometric ornament (Bernet Kempers 1988;  Pham Huy Thong 1990). Such friezes occur-albeit with considerable simplifi- </page> <page sequence="3"> 270 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  0 .

The range of other Dong Son bronze goods, excavated from such sites as the  Dong Son settlement itself Ganse 1958) and more recently from burials at Viet  Khe, Lang Ca, and Lang Vac, includes bowls and situlae (small buckets), minia- ture drums and bells, socketed axes with splayed or "boot-shaped" blades, sock- </page> <page sequence="4"> The Early Metal Phase 271  eted hoes, socketed or tanged arrowheads and spearheads, daggers with anthro- pomorphic handles (see Fig. 9.7), bracelets, belt hooks, and many other items of  more idiosyncratic interest. One massive drum unearthed at Co Loa contained  ninety-six socketed bronze plowshares. Iron is rather rare, but there are a few  spearheads and at least one cast iron hoe, the latter of possible Chinese manu- facture. Imperial Chinese domination of northern Vietnam overlapped with the  later stages of the Dong Son culture and there are some undoubted Chinese  imports in a number of the northern Vietnamese sites, but these occurrences  cannot be used to support the derivation of Dong Son bronze metallurgy as a  whole from China. The local genius expressed in the drum, situla, and axe  forms, plus the importance of lost wax casting (a technique only rarely used at  this time in China), indicate quite clearly that northern Vietnam was a vital  center of bronze metallurgy that had a dramatic impact on many other regions  of Southeast Asia. So too did the contemporary bronzeworking traditions of  Yunnan, to the west. The basic Dong Son and Yunnan artifact styles overlap  only marginally with those of metropolitan China and not at all with the con- temporary bronze and iron industries of India, which lack the emphasis on  socketed hafting. However, the rather limited iron industry of Dong Son could  have an immediate Chinese origin.  The Dong Son culture has a number of other features that merit attention. I  will be returning to certain purely artifactual aspects repeatedly in this chapter,  but it is also of great importance to realize that this culture was centrally in- volved in a transition to a highly stratified and partly urbanized society: The  outer earthen ramparts of the Dong Son fortified center of Co Loa near Hanoi  enclose about 600 hectares. This society had an economy based on intensive  rice production, presumably in rainfed or irrigated bunded fields with plows  and buffalo traction. The intensified production supported an upper ruling  echelon whose wealthy burials have been found in many sites and who in turn  were able to support a degree of craft specialization associated in many other  areas with literate civilizations. It is therefore not surprising that such profes- sionally made items as the magnificent bronze drums, and perhaps Vietnamese  techniques for the manufacture of lesser bronze tools and weapons, should  have had such an impact on the contemporary societies of Indonesia and  Malaysia.  II. THE SA HUYNH CULTURE OF SOUTHERN VIETNAM  I will now move southward to examine a different mainland culture that may  also have been involved in the transmission of metalworking techniques-par- ticularly of iron-to the islands of Southeast Asia. The Sa Huynh culture of  southern Vietnam belonged to an Austronesian-speaking (Chamic) population  </page> <page sequence="5"> 272 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  of Indo-Malaysian origin that appears to have settled this region from either  Peninsular Malaysia or Borneo (see Chapter 4, Section VA). When this settle- ment took place is uncertain, but the event may be documented by the Sa  Huynh culture itself: It appeared in mature form around 600 BC, although pos- sibly ancestral assemblages from the late second millennium BC are now being  reported by Vietnamese archaeologists. Prior to the Sa Huynh culture or its  immediate ancestor, southern Vietnam was presumably occupied entirely by  Austroasiatic-speaking populations. The Chams developed the important Indi- anized civilization of Champa during the first millennium AD, but later suc- cumbed to the pressures of Vietnamese expansion and now survive as minority  hill peoples.  From an Indo-Malaysian point of view, it is significant that the Chams of late  prehistory were the closest resident Austronesian groups to the northern Viet- namese centers of metallurgy. Given their ethnic affiliations, they were un- doubtedly in a central position to introduce new metalworking techniques  acquired on the mainland, particularly of iron, to the Indo-Malaysian Archipel- ago. However, their direct contacts with the bronzeworking centers of the Dong  Son region seem to have been rather limited-only seven Heger I drums have  been found in the south of Vietnam, out of a total of 130 recorded for the  whole country by 1990. These items might thus have been transmitted into the  archipelago by other routes, perhaps through Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia  or directly by sea.  Assemblages of the Sa Huynh culture known to date have come mostly from  jar burial sites. This is a custom that may have been brought by the first Chamic  settlers themselves from the Indo-Malaysian islands, especially if the Niah and  Tabon dates for jar burial from the late second and early first millennia Be  onward can be relied upon. Generally speaking, pottery-jar burial was not char- acteristic of the Dong Son or other contemporary Mainland Southeast Asian  cultures. Where it does occur, as at the Dong Son site of Lang Vac in northern  Vietnam (Ha Van Tan 1980:133), influence from Chamic sources may be sus- pected. The stone burial jars of northern Laos (Colani 1935) do not seem, on  present evidence, to represent a likely region of origin for the Sa Huynh or other  Indo-Malaysian jar burial traditions (although research in the Plain of Jars is  currently in progress).  Major Sa Huynh sites occur in coastal regions from central Vietnam south- ward to the Mekong delta; the type site is Sa Huynh itself, but there are others  farther south in the Mekong delta region at Hang Gon, Phu Hoa, and Giong Ca  Vo, and farther north of Sa Huynh around Da Nang (for summaries see Bell- wood 1978:191-194; Ha Van Tan 1980:136-137; Fontaine 1979, 1980; Nguyen  Duy Ty 1991; Dang and Vu 1995). The finer details of this culture are not of  concern here, and I will return to the whole question of jar burial in Indonesia  </page> <page sequence="6"> The Early Metal Phase 273  \I~  cge  ~  ~I "\Jl/ n  '-.J:?  q  ®-0  Fig. 9.2 The Sa Huynh assemblage, after Parmentier 1924: (a) large burial jar 77 centimeters high  with lid; (b-1) pottery vessels between 14 and 21 centimeters in diameter, decorated by incision or  punctation; (m) bronze vessel 9 centimeters in diameter; (n) clay spindle whorls 3.5 centimeters in  diameter; (o, s-u) stone earrings-(o) and (u) are of lingling-o type--&lt;:tiameters 2-5 centimeters; (p)  iron hoe 17 centimeters long; (q, r) faceted carnelian beads 19 and 15 millimeters long.

It should be noted, however, that the Sa  Huynh burial jars and the associated accessory vessels with their incised and  shell-edge stamped zones of decoration (Fig. 9.2) are paralleled quite closely in  the early Metal phase jar burial assemblages of the Philippines, northern  Borneo, and the Sulawesi Sea region of northern Indonesia. These links have  been strengthened by the discovery of almost identical knobbed pennanular  stone earrings (the so-called lingling-o) and of a special kind of earring or pen- dant with two animal heads (presumably deer) in a number of sites in Thailand,  Vietnam, Palawan, and Sarawak3 (Loofs-Wissowa 1980-1981; and Zuraina 1982  for Niah) (Fig. 9.3).

City, eighteen of these animal-headed pendants made of glass were found (Ngu- yen Kim Dung 1995).  These connections between southern Vietnam and the Borneo-Philippine  region in the early Metal phase (and possibly the preceding Neolithic) may be  important when considering the evidence in the Sa Huynh sites for iron metal- lurgy. The iron repertoire as a whole includes many socketed tools such as  spades, picks, and axes and there are also unsocketed sickles, tanged knives,  spindle whorls, rings, and spiral bracelets. A sword of possible Chinese manu- facture was found at Hang Gon (Saurin 1973), and there is a possibility that the  technology of ironworking was introduced to the area from a Chinese source,  although I suspect that a lot of metallurgical analysis will need to be done  before this question can be settled. As with Dong Son, neither the bronze nor  the iron goods from the Sa Huynh sites resemble Indian models.  </page> <page sequence="8"> The Early Metal Phase 275  In general, the Sa Huynh sites reveal a greater usage of iron than the Dong  Son sites. Sa Huynh bronzes are mainly decorative items rather than tools and  weapons (i.e., bracelets, bells, and small vessels). There are also some rare gold  beads and silver wire (e.g., see Fontaine and Hoang 1975 for Phu Hoa). Most  sites have glass, banded agate, and a range of carnelian beads (round, cigar- shaped, or faceted) that have generally been considered to be of Indian origin  (see Fig. 9.2q, r), although dates of 1200-800 BC for carnelian beads at Nang  Nor (Higham 1996b) and of 700-500 Be from Nil Kham Heng (A. Weiss; pers  comm), both in central Thailand, make a more local origin for these an attrac- tive alternative. The site of Giang Ca Vo has produced evidence for local glass- working dated to ca. 400 BC (Nguyen 1995), but Glover (1990a:36-37) also  reports radiocarbon dates in the fourth century BC for Indian beads in the site  of Ban Don Ta Phet in central Thailand, so contacts with the Indian subconti- nent might also have been underway by this time (see below).  Carbon dates from Phu Hoa, Hang Gon, and Giang Ca Vo suggest an overall  date range for the Sa Huynh culture between 600 Be and 0. Phu Hoa does have  some comb-incised pottery similar to that from the Funanese site of Oc Eo  (early to mid-first millennium AD), so perhaps an overall date range from 600  BC until well into the first millennium AD, thus overlapping with the civiliza- tions of Champa and Funan, will one day be demonstrated for the mature (Iron  Age) Sa Huynh culture as a whole. Internal phases still await definition.  Ill. THE ROLE OF INDIA  The bulk of the Paleometallic sites in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago overlap  in date with the historical evidence for the earliest historical trading states and  the succeeding Indianized kingdoms in the western part of the region. It is nec- essary here to expand a little on the brief survey of this topic given in Chapter  5, Section II. Of direct Chinese contact with the archipelago prior to AD 1000  there is little to report, except to note that northern Vietnam was made a pro- tectorate of the Chinese Han Empire in 111 BC and a province in AD 43, that a  quantity of Han dynasty pottery has been found in uncertain contexts in south- ern Sumatra (Hoop 1940; Heine Geldern 1945; Orsoy de Flines 1969), and that  Chinese Buddhist pilgrims were traveling to India by sea via Indonesia from the  fifth century AD onward. But Chinese trade goods in any quantity are generally  very rare in the archipelago prior to the Song dynasty (see Chapter 5, Note 2).  Indian enterprise, however, presents a very different picture. Sanskrit and  Tamil literary references to Southeast Asia may go back as far as the third cen- tury BC (Wheatley 1961:Chapter 11). By AD 70 there is evidence that cloves  from the Moluccas were reaching Rome (Miller 1969:49).4 Between the first and  fifth centuries AD a number of small indigenous trading "states" (or emporia)  </page> <page sequence="9"> 276 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  MARITIME TRADE IN  SOUTHEAST ASIA:  FIRST THROUGH THE  SIXTH CENTURIES A.D .  .,.;, Flow of Trade, West to East  Fig. 9.4 Maritime trade in Southeast Asia, first to sixth centuries AD. From Hall 1980. Courtesy:  K. R. Hall.  developed in southern Indochina and in the northern part of the Malay Penin- sula (Fig. 9.4). In the first few centuries AD there appears to have been a land  portage for trade goods from the Andaman Sea to the Gulf of Thailand across  the narrow Kra Isthmus (at the head of the Thai-Malaysian Peninsula), but by  the fifth century a lot of the traffic was using the more southerly sailing route  through the Strait of Malacca. This change may have caused the decline of the  trading state of Funan and the consequent rise of Champa in southern Viet- nam, and also of a contemporary Buddhist kingdom in Kedah (Nik Hassan Shu- haimi and Othman Yatim 1990). By the fifth century it is also apparent that  extensive areas of the western Indo-Malaysian Archipelago were becoming in- creasingly important links in the trade routes. Austronesian-speaking crews may  have been in control of much of the shipping (Wolters 1979; Hall1980, 1985)- a circumstance that no doubt played a large role in the settlement of Madagas- car by perhaps AD 700 (Adelaar 1995).  Archaeological evidence for Indian-Southeast Asian trade contact in the  period from about 200 BC to AD 500 is now much stronger than it was when the  first edition of this book was published, especially for Thailand and Bali (Glover  1990a; Ardika and Bellwood 1991). The latter island will be considered later. I  will simply note here, as one of the most noteworthy mainland examples, the  presence of Roman and Indian imported items dated from the second century  </page> <page sequence="10"> The Early Metal Phase 277  AD onward at Oc Eo in southern Vietnam; the Indian items include a Gandha- ran Buddha head, seals, rings, bronzes, and carnelian and agate beads. There are  also second-century AD Roman coins and some Chinese later Han dynasty bronze  mirror fragments (Coectes 1947; Malleret 1959-1963; Christie 1979a; Wheatley  1983). Indian or local raw materials might also have been worked here into  glass and stone beads in Indian styles, as perhaps in the Malay Peninsular sites  of Khlong Thorn in Krabi and Kuala Selinsing in Perak (Veraprasert 1987; Lamb  1965). In addition, Oc Eo has a number of ornaments of tin that could have  been imported from Thailand, Laos, or Peninsular Malaysia. Indeed, some of  the earliest small states on the Malay Peninsula-particularly in its narrower  Thai portion-may have developed partly on the proceeds of an export of tin,  as well as of the forest products and spices that bulk larger in the historical  records (e.g., see Wolters 1967; Dunn 1975; Hall 1985). Gold was probably also  important as a stimulus for early trade (Miksic 1990).  IV. BRONZE ARTIFACTS OF DONG SON AND LOCAL STYLES FROM  THE SUNDA ISLANDS AND PENINSULAR MALAYSIA  A large number of artifacts of precise Dong Son affinity, especially Heger type I  drums, have survived in villages or turned up as chance finds without coherent  archaeological contexts in the Malay Peninsula and the Sunda chain of Indo- nesia. There are now six fragmentary Heger I drums known from Peninsular  Fig. 9.5 The Heger type I drum from Klang: a semidiagrammatic rendering of the decoration on one  half of the tympanum. From Loewenstein 1956. Courtesy: Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic  Society.  </page> <page sequence="11"> 278 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  Malaysia; the Klang (Fig. 9.5) and Tembeling (Batu Pasir Garam) fragments were  both dated to the second century Be on stylistic grounds by Loewenstein  (1956), and two other damaged drums excavated from beneath a possible burial  mound at Kampong Sungei Lang in Selangor have been carbon dated rather  uncertainly from an associated wooden plank between about 500 BC and AD  200 (Peacock 1964b, 1979). There are also two further drum fragments from  Kuala Trengganu on the east coast.  No fewer than fifty-six drums or parts thereof are known from the Sunda  chain of Indonesia, mostly from Java, Sumatra, and the southern Moluccas,  with examples occurring as far east as the Kai Islands south of western New  Guinea, and also the Bird's Head of West New Guinea itself (see Bernet Kempers  1988 for a list). Some of the more significant Indonesian examples include the  "Makalamau" drum from Sangeang Island near Sumbawa (Plate 46), with its fig- ures in possible Han dynasty and Kushan (northern Indian) or Satavahana (cen- tral Indian) costumes (Heine Geldern 1947); the drum from Kai with its deer- and tiger-hunting frieze; and that from Salayer (Plate 47) with its elephants and  peacocks (Schmeltz 1904). All these are scenes that would presumably have  been unfamiliar to the inhabitants of the eastern Indonesian islands where the  drums eventually came to rest, so on these grounds alone it is clearly most  unlikely that they were cast locally (although Imamura 1993 suggests that some  of the youngest Heger I drums might have been cast in Indonesia). Indeed, in  terms of style and a frequent high lead content, it looks as if most of these Pen- insular Malaysian and Indonesian drums were manufactured in Vietnam, many  during the period of Chinese domination after the second century BC (Bernet  Kempers 1988). Heine Geldern (1947) suggested that the Sangeang drum might  have been cast in Indianized Funan as late as AD 250.  One interesting observation by Bernet Kempers is that all drums found east  of Bali have four frogs cast in relief around their tympana; another is that the  rather disintegrated patterns on the Indonesian drums-derived from the war- rior friezes and boat motifs on the oldest Vietnamese drums-suggest that they  are relatively late in date of manufacture (see also Imamura 1993). Bernet  Kempers describes how each Heger I drum was cast in one piece: Wax slabs laid  over a clay core were impressed with the boat and procession patterns using  clay or stone molds, while some of the more naturalistic patterns, such as the  house scenes, were incised individually into the wax. The wax was then sealed  in a clay outer mold held in place by driven "spacers," and melted out prior to  the pouring of the molten bronze. This eire perdu (lost wax) method can still be  seen in use in Mandalay (Burma) for casting temple Buddha statues and minia- ture bronze drums.  In terms of distribution within the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago, it may be  important to stress that Heger I drums have mainly been found in Peninsular  </page> <page sequence="12"> The Early Metal Phase 279  Malaysia and in the islands of the Sunda chain (Sumatra, Java, Bali, and the  Lesser Sundas/southem Moluccas). Two unpublished drums have recently been  found at Kota Waringin in West Kalimantan and there are three pieces from the  Bird's Head of New Guinea, but none have ever been reported from the rest of  Borneo, Sulawesi, the northern Moluccas, or the Philippines. This distribution  does of course overlap in the west with that of the earliest recorded Indian con- tact, and it may be that many of these exotic bronzes were transported second- arily, long after their dates of manufacture, within the trade (especially spice  trade) networks of the earliest historical states in the Malay Peninsula and west- em Indonesia. Loofs-Wissowa (1991) has suggested that they were bestowed on  local chiefs as symbols of kingship and authority by politico-religious authori- ties in Vietnam, and that the boat scenes on the sides represent fertility-focused  boat races rather than the more commonly favored identification as "ships of  the dead" carrying souls into the afterlife. On the other hand, Bernet Kempers  (1988) suggested that many could have been carried into Indonesia by refugees  from the bloodshed of early Sinicized Vietnam. Whetever the mechanisms of  their dispersal, it would be clearly unwise to regard all of the Heger I drums as  inherently "prehistoric."  A number of other copper or bronze artifacts found in Indonesia might also  represent imports from Vietnam. There can be no certainty of this, but out- standing finds of Dong Son affinity that attract attention in this regard include  the male statuette similar to a Dong Son dagger handle (Fig. 9.6) from Satus  near Bogor, a miniature Heger I drum from Cibadak in western Java (Heekeren  1958), and a lidded bronze vessel with Dong Son circle and tangent decoration  found in the drum burial at Lamongan in East Java (Bintarti 1985a). While  details of date and composition for these artifacts are insufficient to prove a  mainland Asian origin, it nevertheless seems possible that they were transmit- ted, like the Heger I drums, as status items into the chiefly lineages of the Sunda  Islands. Indeed, the early Metal phase sarcophagi of Bali (see below) have  yielded large numbers of socketed tools with heart-shaped blades-possibly  small axes or projectile points-of a type recently shown to have been manufac- tured in very large numbers between 700 and 500 BC in the copperworking site  of Nil Kham Heng in central Thailand (Weiss; pers comm). In the absence of  metallurgical analysis, however, this cannot prove importation into Bali; it  should also be noted that Sumatra and Java do have many small deposits of  copper ore, albeit not clearly utilized in prehistory (Bronson 1992), and Penin- sular Malaysia and Bangka/Belitung of course have ample supplies of tin.  A fairly rapid result of this external introduction of bronze goods and tech- nology into the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago was clearly the actual establish- ment of local metalworking centers. There have been several finds of stone or  terra-cotta valves from the molds used for casting copper and bronze axes from  </page> <page sequence="13"> Fig. 9.6 Top: bronze dagger handle from Dong Son, 11 centimeters high.

Socketed bronze axes  exist in large numbers, some with incised decoration in typical Dong Son style  (Fig. 9.7). There is also the important fragment of a volcanic tuff stamp for  impressing the wax mold for a bronze drum of Pejeng type (below) from Sembi- ran in Bali, dated by Indian imports to the first two centuries AD. This is clear  evidence that some local casting was being carried out at this time (Ardika and  Bellwood 1991).  Evidence for the beginnings of one or more Indonesian casting traditions  can be seen in a number of quite splendid copper or bronze objects that are not  in a classic Dong Son style. In one group is the almost 2-meter-high hourglass- shaped drum from Pejeng in Bali (first recorded by Rumphius in 1690), together  with a number of similar but smaller Pejeng-type drums from this island and  Java that have been placed in a stylistic sequence by Bernet Kempers (1988; see  also Bintarti 1990). Some of these drums were clearly made in Bali because,  apart from the Sembiran stamp fragment, three more decorated stamp pieces  are known from the village of Manuaba (Plate 48). The Sembiran stamp frag- ment carries part of a running triangular motif like that on the Pejeng drum  itself. Pejeng-type drums have also been found in direct association with Heger  I drums at Kradenanrejo (Lamongan) and near Semarang in Java. One Pejeng- type drum was found by villagers digging a well at Pacung near Sembiran in  Bali, and this appears to be from a layer contemporary with the one that yielded  the Sembiran stamp fragment. The Pacung drum, like the others of this type,  has its body and tympanum cast separately (McConnell and Glover 1990); in  this specimen the tympanum is of bronze, the body of copper.  Other items related in style and characterized, like the Pejeng drum, by the  use of a face mask in a dominant position in the decoration include an unusual  flask from Ujungpandang (Makassar), a ceremonial axe from Savu in eastern  Indonesia (Bintarti 1981a), and two (originally three; one is now lost) ceremo- nial axes from Roti (Fig. 9.8), although one of the latter does show a typical Dong  Son tangent and circle motif. A second stylistic group, in this case of flasks and  large clapperless bells, is distinguished by an unusual and elaborate type of  incised spiral decoration that is again outside the Dong Son repertoire. The  flasks, of which a total of six are now known (Glover 1992), include specimens  from Kerinci and Lampung in Sumatra, from Madura, and from Kanda! in Cam- bodia (the last two almost identical; Plate 49 shows that from Madura). The  bells include one from Battambang in Cambodia, three (one now lost) from  Klang in Selangor, and a newly discovered example from Kampong Pencu near  the Muar River in Johor (Plate SO). The Muar bell has been dated by thermo- luminescence-on a fragment of the clay casting core preserved in its narrow  </page> <page sequence="15"> Fig. 9.7 ·swallowtail" bronze axes from Java (scale in centimeters).

Although this date is not very  precise, at least it does not contradict a view that these bells and flasks belonged  to a first-millennium AD casting tradition that was not Vietnamese, but that  might have been of ultimate Vietnamese technological derivation. Indeed, a  bronze bell that might conceivably represent a prototype for these specimens  was excavated by Janse at Dong Son (Loewenstein 1956:Fig. 22). For these bells  and flasks there is a huge region of potential manufacture from Cambodia to  Madura, and a bell very similar to the ones described has also been found at  Dabona in Yunnan.  Other Indonesian bronzes of possible local manufacture include the statu- ettes and knobbed bracelets from Bangkinang in southern Sumatra (Heekeren  </page> <page sequence="17"> 284 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  --------·--·----·-------·-- 1958:Plates 5 and 9) and the remarkable bronze canoe model from Dobo village  on Flores (Bintarti 198Sb:64). There are also daggers or short swords with iron  blades and bronze handles from Prajekan (Heekeren 1958:Plate 11) and Luma- jang (Cselik 1986) in Java, reminiscent of a widespread tradition in Iron Age  sites in Yunnan, Vietnam, and Thailand. One also comes from Gilimanuk in  Bali (see below).  V. THE SLAB GRAVES AND IRON INDUSTRY OF PENINSULAR  MALAYSIA  Apart from the drums and bells already considered, the early Metal phase in  Peninsular Malaysia is also associated with a number of slab-lined graves (Plate  51), presumably for extended inhumations (although bones always seem to  have dissolved) found in southern Perak and northern Selangor (Evans 1928b,  1931b; Collings 1937b; Linehan 1951; Adi 1993). The general range of associ- ated artifacts from the graves includes glass and carnelian beads, a stone bark- cloth beater, a bronze bowl, and a most unusual industry of iron tools. The pot- tery is wheel made, either plain or slipped with a thick resinous coat and usu- ally with impressed lip patterns. Similar pottery was also found with part of a  socketed iron spearhead under the mound that contained the two Sungei Lang  bronze drums (Peacock 1979). One recently discovered grave in Selangor has pro- duced Chinese pottery evidently of Tang date (seventh to tenth centuries AD).  The iron industry has been found in several other sites apart from the slab  graves, and there appears to be a unity in terms of style and the associations of  different tool forms in hoards that occur commonly in Peninsular Malaysia.  The forms have been clearly described by Sieveking (1956a) and include axes  (some with very long shafts, known colloquially as tulang mawas), knives, and  sickles, all with shaft holes. In addition, there are some socketed spearheads and  tanged knives (Fig. 9.9). The tools appear to be of low-carbon steel, according to  Sieveking, which suggests that the iron was roasted purposefully in a bed of  charcoal after the initial smelting process. Tools of this type were also found  with the Klang bells as well as with the dated Sungei Lang drums.  Sieveking saw the Peninsular Malaysian iron industry as having an origin in  the socketing tradition for bronze tools represented in the Dong Son culture of  Vietnam, a tradition he believed was transmitted in iron toward Peninsular  Malaysia via southern Vietnam after the first century AD. At the time he was  writing there was little archaeological evidence to support such a connection,  but recent excavations have produced the highly respectable socketed iron  industry of the Sa Huynh culture of southern Vietnam (Section II), and from  just above the top of the Malay Peninsula in southwestern Thailand there are  prolific iron industries from Ongbah Cave and Ban Don Ta Phet.

Ban Don Ta Phet (Glover 1990b) is an open burial ground, presumably  for extended burials, although-as with the Peninsular Malaysian cists-no bone  has survived. The iron industry here, which has a larger socketed component  than that from Ongbah and also a shaft-hole sickle or billhook a little like the  Peninsular Malaysian ones, is associated with a rich array of Indian carnelian  and etched agate beads, and appears to date between 2,400 and 2,000 years ago  (Glover 1990a).  One feature of the early Mainland Southeast Asian iron industries is that  they are all characterized by different and localized tool forms, especially in  terms of hafting. This localization is more marked than in the case of the bronze  industries, where there is the integrating phenomenon of the long-distance trade  of status items such as drums and other decorated ceremonial objects. Iron  objects give an impression of being localized in style to regional industries and  hence manufactured on the spot for use as everyday tools and weapons with  only limited trade or status value. This naturally suggests that ironworking was  a process that could be carried out easily by small, local communities and that  knowledge of its manufacture spread rapidly from about 2,000 years ago, as the  superior economic potential and easier availability of this metal-compared to  bronze-was realized.  In Peninsular Malaysia, the iron tools and slab graves are apparently contem- porary with a rather enigmatic coastal site at Kuala Selinsing in Perak. The orig- inal assemblage from here was excavated by Evans (1932) and included a wheel- made, comb-incised ware like that from Oc Eo in Vietnam (early to middle first  millennium AD), a carnelian seal with an inscription in Pallava script, evidence  for local blue glass and agate bead manufacture, glass bracelets, and lead slag.  The site was evidently an estuarine pile village; it has produced human burials  in canoe-shaped coffins (Sieveking 1956b). Beck (Appendix in Collings 1937b)  dated the monochrome glass beads to between AD 1 and 400 (cf. Francis 1990).  Recently, excavations at Kuala Selinsing have been started again by Nik Hassan  Shuhaimi (1991; Davison 1991), who was unable to locate the original Evans  site but confirms that the location as a whole consists of a series of mounds of  earth and shell in a mangrove swamp, possibly deposited under the floors of  pile dwellings.  According to current information, the Kuala Selinsing sites were inhabited  between 200 BC and AD 1000. Nik Hassan Shuhaimi has recovered Middle East- ern pottery dating between the sixth and tenth centuries, locally made incised  and paddle-impressed pottery, shell bracelets, tin ear pendants, and extended  burials laid under sherd sheets. The latter occur in many central and northeast- </page> <page sequence="20"> The Early Metal Phase 287  em Thai sites and could be indicators of some degree of Austroasiatic linguistic  affinity, as the Mon language seems to have been widely spoken in the northern  Malay Peninsula prior to Malay expansion (Stargardt 1983; Benjamin 1987).  Kuala Selinsing has also yielded lots of valuable economic information, includ- ing bones of pig, dog, and chicken, plus remains of coconuts, gourds, bamboo,  areca nut, pandanus and bamboo mats, rice husks, and part of a dugout canoe.  The whole site complex might thus have been the residence of a local commu- nity in frequent touch with the trade network linking India and China at this  time via the Straits of Malacca (for the archaeological record of some of the  lashed-lug and dowelled boats that perhaps serviced this trade, see Manguin  1989).  A final point to note about the Peninsular Malaysian early Metal phase  industries is that they are presumably associated-unfortunately to an unknow- able degree-with the Austronesian coastal settlement of the region (Bellwood  1993). Linguistically (see Chapter 4, Section VA), an origin for the Malays, and  also for the other smaller Orang Melayu Asli groups such as the Temuan and  Jakun (Carey 1976), may perhaps be located in Sumatra (where slab graves also  occur) or western Borneo during the first millennium BC. But there is little  archaeological evidence to throw light on this, and the whole period between  the Malaysian Neolithic as represented at Gua Cha and the Indianized mon- astery and temple monuments of Kedah, which mainly postdate AD 800 (Nik  Hassan Shuhaimi and Othman Yatim 1990), is in need of further research.  VI. THE EARLY METAL PHASE IN SUMATRA, JAVA, AND BALl  In this section I will describe the slab graves and stone monuments of southern  Sumatra and Java, the stone sarcophagi of eastern Java and Bali, and a number  of other important excavated early Metal phase assemblages in western Indo- nesia. I do not intend to go deeply into the question of megaliths and will not  be concerned with such matters as the oft-proposed unity of megalithic cultures  (e.g., Christie 1979b), or with Heine Geldem's theories that different types of  megaliths can be ordered into "older" and "younger" strata (Heine Geldem 1937,  1945). Most of the celebrated ethnographic "megalithic" cultures of Indonesia  -on Nias, amongst the Bataks of northern Sumatra, in parts of Borneo, in cen- tral and southern Sulawesi, and in some of the Lesser Sunda Islands (see Feld- man 1985; Newton and Barbier 1988 for recent reviews)-are all of recent or  ethnographic date and have no archaeologically documented antecedents. It is  perhaps time for prehistorians to join the ethnologists and art historians in  examining the antecedents of these recent cultures, but so far there has been  little progress in this respect.  </page> <page sequence="21"> 288 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  ---~------------- A. Sumatra  One of the main concentrations of prehistoric stone monuments in Indonesia  lies on the 70-kilometer-long Pasemah Plateau around Pagaralam in southern  Sumatra (Hoop 1932; Heekeren 1958:63-79). A fairly simple megalithic tradi- tion ("dolmens," mortars, and upright stones, the latter often in single or dou- ble alignments) occurs widely in the adjacent Lampung district at the southern  tip of the island (Sukendar 1979). The Pasemah monuments, however, are quite  striking and have attracted attention since 1850. The structures include groups  and alignments of upright stones, stone blocks with carefully hollowed cuplike  mortars, troughs with human heads carved on their ends (Plate 52), simple ter- raced platforms (often referred to as "graves"), "dolmens" of uncertain function  with large capstones, slab graves (some in the form of massive underground  chambers), and some remarkable stone carvings of humans and animals.  The slab graves excavated by Hoop (1932) at Tegurwangi (Plate 53) contained  large numbers of glass beads and a few metal objects-copper or bronze spirals,  a gold pin, and a corroded iron lance-that cannot in themselves be closely  dated. As in the Peninsular Malaysian slab graves, the acid soils had dissolved  all traces of bone. One of the Tegurwangi graves and several megalithic cham- ber graves at Tanjungara (Bie 1932) (Plate 54) and Kotaraya Lembak (Soejono  1991) still preserved on discovery traces of polychrome wall paintings showing  human figures and water buffalo. One of the newly discovered chamber graves  at Kotaraya Lembak has a quite remarkable frontal figure of a cockerel in fight- ing stance painted in four colors (Caldwell in press) (Fig. 9.10).  The Pasemah human and animal statues are carved in relief or in the round  on large stone blocks in a dynamic style. Men are shown riding on elephants or  buffalo (Plate 55), wearing bracelets, anklets, helmets with peaks at the back,  loincloths, tunics, and earplugs. Necklaces of oblong plaques and what appear  to be faceted beads are also shown. Animal and human heads are often carved  in considerable detail, while bodies are often disproportionately small or simply  left out, depending perhaps on the original shape of the stone. Some reliefs also  show combat themes of men fighting tigers or snakes, although the elephants  and water buffalo are more often in situations demonstrating human control  and possibly domestication or taming.  The most important chronological indicators on these carvings are the Heger  I drums shown on the Batugajah and Airpurah reliefs (Plate 56), painted on a  Kotaraya Lembak chamber wall (Soejono 1991:19) and possibly once shown on  an incised carving on a rock outcrop near Tegurwangi (Caldwell in press). These  could indicate a date in the early or middle first millennium AD, although some  may overlap in time with the period of the Srivijaya trading state on the plains  to the east around Palembang (i.e., after AD 670).  </page> <page sequence="22"> \  1\t 0!

Only the slab graves at Kuningan in western Java appear, rather uncer- tainly, to lack metal associations (Kosasih et al. 1986), and all other sites appear  to belong to the first millennium AD or later. Knowledge of the Javanese slab  graves is vague (for some data see Heekeren 1958:46-54; Suryanto 1985; PPAN  1992), although Hoop (1935) did present a clear report of some excavated around  Gunung Kidul near Wonosari in central Java. Well-preserved examples of these  at Kajar and Bleberan (Plate 57) produced evidence for extended burials with a  lot of iron tools (mainly tanged knives, a dagger, axes, and chisels), bronze  rings, and beads of glass and faceted carnelian (Fig. 9.11). The slab graves and  carved sarcophagi examined by Heekeren (1931) near Besuki in eastern java  produced no coherent archaeological assemblages, but similar monuments at  Pakauman were apparently associated with Chinese imported ceramics of ninth  century AD date or later. Therefore, like the slab graves of Peninsular Malaysia,  many of these graves might have overlapped in date with the Javanese histori- cal civilizations, as Hoop thought possible for the Gunung Kidul sites.  There are also a number of localities in western java with complexes of  stone-paved terraces and platforms that appear to belong to a pre-Indic architec- tural tradition. Bintarti (1981b) has described an excellent example at Gunung  Padang, south of Cianjur (see also Sukendar 198Sb), and others occur in the  northwestern corner of the island at Lebak Sibedug (Hoop 1932:Plate 204) and  Area Domas (Tricht 1929). These structures probably served as open-air temples  or gathering places, rather like the marae of Polynesia. Stone human statues of  fairly simple shape, which many authors have called "Polynesian," are also  known from localities widely distributed through Java and Bali (Mulia 1980;  Sutaba 1997). Unfortunately, it is impossible to date these monuments and  statues, although one statue of this type near Bandung carries an inscription,  possibly secondary, of AD 1341 (Suleiman 1976:8). The apparent Polynesian  similarities are either coincidental or may reflect some form of shared early Aus- tronesian architectural and artistic inheritance.  Apart from the research on the stone graves and other monuments, which  have always attracted much archaeological attention in western Indonesia, there  have been a number of excavations in other types of sites belonging to the early  Metal phase in Java. As I will show later, the practice of jar burial was predomi- nant mainly in the more easterly parts of Indonesia, but flexed primary burials  in jars have been uncovered with inhumation burials at Anyar in western Java  (Heekeren 1956a; Sukendar et al. 1982), and jar burials also occur at Tebing- </page> <page sequence="24"> n. 13  t  16 11  1&amp;  21  14  22 2.3  25 26  0 10cm 0 2cm  Fig. 9.11 Artifacts from slab graves at Gunung Kidul, central Java.

From Hoop 1935.  </page> <page sequence="25"> 292 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  ------------------ tinggi in southern Sumatra (Heekeren 1958:83). Excavations at Plawangan in  north-central Java (Sukendar and Awe 1981) have produced an interesting mix- ture of flexed or extended inhumations and burials of both adults and children  in jars with inverted-vessel lids. In one case a flexed child skeleton was placed  inside an upturned Heger I drum together with pottery, a bronze spearhead and  bracelet, glass beads, and gold eye and mouth covers (Soejono 1991). The  assemblage from Plawangan also includes iron knives, a bronze fishhook and  ring, and incised and stamped pots placed at the heads and feet of the extended  burials.  At another north Javanese site called Kradenanrejo, near Lamongan, a child  was placed inside a drum of Pejeng type with a Heger I drum on top as a  cover, with carnelian, glass and faceted gold beads, a bronze container with  Dong Son circle and tangent ornamentation (Section IV), gold umbrella- shaped ornaments (hints of an overlap with Buddhism?), two bronze cups, and  various other iron and bronze items (Bintarti 198Sa; unfortunately few of these  items have ever been illustrated, and the Pejeng drum was destroyed when  found).  Other Javanese sites that have produced important early Metal phase assem- blages include Leuwiliang, near Bogar, where alignments of grave goods from  now-dissolved inhumations include an anthropomorphic bronze pendant (Soe- jono 1984: Foto 77) and a face mask of an unidentified precious metal (PPAN  1988), and Pejaten, to the south of Jakarta (Sutayasa 1979), where baked- clay casting molds for bronze axes and knives are apparently radiocarbon dated  to before AD 200. None of these sites can as yet be placed within a coherent  reconstruction of Javanese prehistory, and the most urgent requirements are  for a fuller publication record and many more well documented radiocarbon  dates.  The so-called Buni cultural complex of looted graves on the western coast of  northern Java (Sutayasa 1972, 1973, 1979) also has obvious future potential for  archaeological investigation. Brief records of the grave goods, apparently found  with extended burials, include gold and carnelian beads, stone adzes, undefined  metal artifacts, and a range of carved-paddle-impressed and incised pottery  with a variety of forms, including ring-footed vessels, high-necked flasks, and  knobbed lids. The Buni complex is of great significance because it has produced  three flat-based vessels of the distinctive south Indian Rouletted Ware; one each  from the sites of Kobak Kendal, Cibutek, and Cibango (Walker and Santoso  1977) (Fig. 9.12). Another location at Batujaya to the east of Buni has produced  another sherd of Rouletted Ware (McKinnon et al. 1994). One site at Rengas- dengklok has also produced gold eye and mouth covers of a type found also in  Balinese sites of the same date (see below, and Miksic 1990). Because this rather  exciting material has been found in the same part of western Java as the oldest  </page> <page sequence="26"> The Early Metal Phase 293  Fig. 9.12 Pottery from the Buni complex, northwestern Java.

Sanskrit inscriptions (e.g., the Purnavarman inscription at Tugu, possibly of  fifth-century date; Noorduyn and Verstappen 1972), it is apparent that the Buni  sites, despite their tragic looting, may contain information directly relevant to  the initial period of contact between India and Java, presumably in the first few  centuries AD. This period has recently been highlighted by discoveries on Bali,  especially at the site of Sembiran, to which we turn below.  C. Bali  Bali is renowned for its highly distinctive sarcophagi, carved from soft tuff or  breccia, found mainly at sites in the central and southern interior of the island  (Heekeren 19SS; 1958:54-58; Soejono 1977, 1995; Sukarto 1979; Ardika 1987).  These have separate bodies and high, domed lids and usually have knobbed  projections on their ends, sometimes carved into human or turtlelike heads  (Plate 58). A range of sizes was produced to accommodate both flexed and ex- tended burials. The grave goods include glass and carnelian beads, some rather  </page> <page sequence="27"> 294 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  indeterminate iron objects, unusual ornaments and finger-sheaths made of spi- raled bronze wire (e.g., see Soejono 1977:Foto 67-70), and socketed bronze tools  with crescentic and heart-shaped blades (Ardika 1987), the latter being closely  paralleled in mid-first millennium BC contexts in central Thailand (see Section  IV). At Gilimanuk in western Bali, two of these stone sarcophagi-one with a lid  shaped like a buffalo, the other with a stylized design apparently based on  female genitalia-have been excavated in contexts perhaps dating to about 1,500  to 2,000 years ago (Soejono 1995).  Gilimanuk is an important coastal burial site that has produced extended  burials and jar burials (some in double mouth-to-mouth jars) with associated  pottery and bronzes like those from some of the sarcophagus sites (Soejono  1979; Santoso 1985). Other Gilimanuk grave goods include a tanged iron spear- head, an iron dagger with a bronze handle and beads of gold, glass, and carne- lian. Gilimanuk and a sarcophagus at Pangkungliplip have both produced gold  eye and mouth covers, like the Buni example mentioned above. The assemblage  is clearly contemporary with those of Buni and Sembiran and thus falls some- where between 200 BC and AD 300, a range solidly confirmed by nine C14 dates  from the site listed by Bronson and Glover (1984:41).  No actual Indian material has yet been reported from Gilimanuk, but this is  certainly not the case for the site of Sembiran, near Tejakula on the north coast  of Bali (Ardika 1991; Ardika and Bellwood 1991). Here, evidence for early  Indian contacts with Bali has recently come to light in prolific quantities.  Excavations through coastal alluvial sediments down to the water table at  about 3.5 meters depth have yielded many pieces of Rouletted Ware (Plate 59),  together with sherds of Arikamedu (Tamil Nadu) molded vessels of types 10,  18, and 141 (Wheeler et al. 1946), a black-slipped sherd with a scratched line of  Kharoshthi or Brahmi characters, the above-mentioned fragment of a tuff  stamp for decorating the wax preform of a Pejeng type drum (Section IV), and  local pottery of incised and impressed types similar to those from Gilimanuk.  Some of the pottery, especially a black-slipped ware of uncertain origin (an  import?), has rice chaff temper. Rice phytoliths in the soils of the site indicate  that this cereal was grown during the period of occupation (Doreen Bowdery,  pers comm).  Sembiran and the Buni complex bring back the question of the origins and  date of the initial Indian contacts with western Indonesia. On the matter of  date, it has already been noted that Indian beads occur in Mainland Southeast  Asian sites, such as Ban Don Ta Phet and Giang Ca Vo, dated to the fourth cen- tury BC. The Rouletted Ware (which has so far been found outside India/Sri  Lanka only in Indonesia and Vietnam) was originally dated to the first and sec- ond centuries AD by Wheeler et al. (1946), owing to its association with Roman  imports at Arikamedu. Begley (1983, 1986) has since pushed this dating back  </page> <page sequence="28"> The Early Metal Phase 295  into the second century Be. Rouletted Ware has been recovered from excava- tions along the whole eastern coast of the subcontinent, from Anuradhapura in  Sri Lanka (Deraniyagala 1986) to sites as far north as Sisupalgarh in Orissa and  Chandraketugarh in West Bengal. It is in these northerly sites that very distinc- tive etched agate beads occur in late first millennium BC contexts-beads of a  type that have also been found in sites of the early Metal phase in Talaud and  the Philippines. The sites with Rouletted Ware in south India and Sri Lanka also  have utilitarian pottery decorated with carved-paddle-impressed and stamped  patterns (Ray 1997) that find suggestive parallels in the pottery of the Buni  complex, Sembiran, and Gilimanuk. It would be premature to suggest a definite  link between India and Indonesia from this type of pottery on present evidence,  and Solheim (1990) has for many years favored a southern Chinese origin for  the Southeast Asian paddle-impressed wares as a whole (which belong in his  "Bau-Malay" pottery complex). But I believe that the possibility of an Indian  link does deserve careful consideration.  One further point about this burgeoning evidence for Indian trading contact  with Indonesia in the centuries around the birth of Christ concerns its impact  on those regions beyond the "core" Indianized regions of Sumatra, Java, and  Bali. It is worth repeating that the far-flung distribution of Heger I drums might  have had much to do with these activities, especially via those trade networks  that surely extended from Java and Bali into the Moluccas for cloves, nutmeg,  and other spices destined for the Mediterranean, India, and China. But, more  than this, it has been my observation during many years of fieldwork in Indo- nesia-a difficult observation to substantiate in a brief text-that the pottery  assemblages all over the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago in the centuries of the  early Metal phase are remarkably similar, whether they be from Java, Bali,  Talaud, or Halmahera (cf. Diniasti 1986). The Papuan-speaking peoples of north- ern Halmahera even appear to have first adopted pottery making at this time,  perhaps as a result of increasing trade contacts. Some of these Indonesian  "outer-island" assemblages will now be reviewed.  VII. THE EARLY METAL PHASE IN EAST MALAYSIA AND EASTERN  INDONESIA  The early Metal phase in the northern and eastern parts of the Indo-Malaysian  Archipelago is now becoming better known as a result of a number of recent  cave and open-site excavations. In the northeast, many sites have yielded evi- dence for a fairly homogeneous tradition of secondary burial in large jars or  pottery bone boxes. In the Lesser Sundas, primary and jar burials often occur  together, as in Java and Bali. The pottery assemblages of this phase all demon- strate fairly close relationships, and the period as a whole-with its copper/  </page> <page sequence="29"> 296 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  Fig. 9.13 Pottery bone box containing human teeth from Bato Puti  Cave, Tabon Cave complex, Palawan. From Fox 1970. Courtesy:  National Museum of the Philippines.  bronze and iron associations-may be dated from about 200 BC to AD 1000. The  tradition of jar burial continued after AD 1000 into ethnographic times in some  remoter parts of Borneo, Sulawesi, and the Philippines, but in association with  imported Chinese and Southeast Asian glazed ceramics that lie outside the  upper chronological limits of this chapter.  The jar burial tradition is seen at its most elaborate in the islands around the  Sulawesi and Sulu Seas (northern Borneo, Talaud, central and southern Philip- pines) and in parts of the Lesser Sundas-especially Sumba. In the former region  it involved the placing of previously exposed secondary burials in large jars or  bone boxes provided with lids (Fig. 9.13). Small accessory vessels were placed in  or around the jars, together with beads, bracelets, and metal artifacts, to list the  most common grave goods. The jars were placed either on the floors of fairly  remote caves (in which situations they have invariably become smashed and  their contents mingled) or in pits dug into open sites (where they have nor- mally survived fairly complete).  In general, the tradition of jar burial gave way fairly rapidly to extended  inhumation burial in those regions influenced by the Indianized and the later  Islamic states, and also in those parts of the Philippines closest to the Chinese  trade networks. The whole tradition thus achieved its apogee in the first millen- nium AD. In eastern Sabah and the Philippines, the second millennium wit- nessed a widespread change to a tradition of log-coffin burial.  </page> <page sequence="30"> The Early Metal Phase 297  A. The Talaud Islands and Northern Moluccas  The first jar burial site to be discussed is the small cave of Leang Buidane on  Salebabu Island in the Talaud group of northeastern Indonesia (Bellwood 1976a,  1976b, 1981). The jar burials here were originally placed on the floor of the  cave, but were smashed-presumably deliberately (Bellwood 1981:71)-in antiq- uity. The bone containers comprised a range of large globular jars with round  bases and occasional tripod or ring feet, together with flat-based cylindrical ves- sels and roughly rectangular pottery boxes (Fig. 9.14). All these large containers  appear originally to have been lidded. The human bones (Bulbeck 1978) were  mainly of young individuals under forty years of age. The ratio of thirty-six  individuals (based on teeth) to a minimum of thirty-two large vessels suggests  that only one individual was placed in each container. The bones were mainly  skulls, mandibles, and limb bones-pelvic bones and vertebrae appear to have  been discarded or lost. The teeth revealed some evidence for betel staining,  occasional tooth evulsion for females during life, and a Mongoloid morphology  presumably directly ancestral to that of the present population. In my original  reports I dated this site between AD 700 and 1200 according to a number of  rather oblique chronological indicators, but as a result of my more recent work  in Sabah I now incline to an earlier commencement date.  The accessory vessels and other items found with the remains of the jar  burials form a homogeneous stylistic group and define a Buidane culture that  appears to have been current throughout Talaud for much of the first millen- nium AD. The small pots include round-based carinated vessels with quite elab- orate horizontal zones of incised decoration (Fig. 9.15), distinctive high-necked  flasks with a polished red slip, and a range of cooking vessels. The carinated  vessels in particular have an angular cross-sectioned rim that is also character- istic of this phase in Sabah. The Buidane ceramic range is also very closely paral- leled in a southern Philippine site visited in the 1920s by the Guthe Expedition,  but unfortunately in a now unknown location (Solheim 1964b:94-101, the  "unknown site"). However, the concept of a Buidane culture is best confined to  the Talaud Islands themselves, since all the sites of this period reveal a gradual  falloff in similarity with distance across the whole region, from the central Phil- ippines to Sumba. At present it would be unwise to class the material at a level  greater than that of the individual region or island group.  The other artifacts found in Leang Buidane include shell bracelets and beads,  part of a glass bracelet, beads of agate and carnelian, coral flask stoppers, and a  penannular pottery earring. The stone beads are particularly interesting: The  majority are either spherical or elongated faceted red carnelians with a precision  in drilling that probably indicates an Indian origin, although the shapes are  chronologically complacent and belong to types common in both India and  </page> <page sequence="31"> \I  \\ I  / \\ I  I  /  (  I 7 I  , ' ., \  _ _j  l 1  1  I'  7  jl  I I  I I  '~- Fig. 9.14 Large burial jars from Leang Buidane, Talaud.

However, there are three black  agate beads with designs etched in white (Fig. 9.16) that are paralleled very pre- cisely in late first millennium sc layers in major Gangetic and Indus sites such  as Hastinapura (Lal1954-1945:Plate LV), Taxila (Dikshit 1952:35), Kausambi and  Chandraketugarh. There is also a banded agate bead of a type common from  the Harappan onwards. The etched agates support the above-mentioned evi- dence from Sembiran for contact between India and Indonesia as early as 200  sc, although in a location as remote as Talaud the beads might have been in cir- culation for many years prior to their eventual burial.  Leang Buidane has also produced metal artifacts; there are a number of inde- terminate pieces of iron, and the copper or bronze objects include bracelet frag- ments, a bronze cone, and a copper socketed axe. Three baked-clay valves of the  bivalve molds for axes and other cuprous objects were also found, indicating  that metal casting was carried out locally, although this may have been con- fined to recasting of artifacts that were originally imported. In general, the  Buidane metallurgy fits conformably within the range reported from this date  in Sabah and the Philippines, and the copper- and bronzeworking seems to  have been restricted to bivalve mold techniques, without the use of wax.  In the northern Moluccas, fragmentary jar burials have been excavated in  the cave of Uattamdi on Kayoa Island, associated with glass beads, fragments of  iron and bronze, undated Chinese coins, and large reef shells, all apparently  placed as grave goods. Dates for this assemblage run from about AD 1 to 1200  (Bellwood et al. 1993). Other regions of the northern Moluccas have produced  </page> <page sequence="34"> The Early Metal Phase 301  incised pottery of early Metal phase affinity, radiocarbon dated to the first  millennium AD, associated with secondary skull burials in the rock shelter of  Tanjung Pinang on Morotai and found in habitation deposits in the cave of Gua  Siti Nafisah on Halmahera and the open site of Buwawansi on Gebe. This mate- rial is still being analyzed, but it appears that pottery making began in the  Papuan-speaking regions of north Halmahera at this time, perhaps, as noted  above, because of the increasing frequency of trade contact emanating from the  western regions of Indonesia.  B. Eastern Sabah  In Chapter 7, Section IIIB, I discussed the Neolithic pottery assemblages found  in Bukit Tengkorak and Agop Atas. Bukit Tengkorak has not produced any  metal, but the cave of Agop Atas in the Madai massif (Bellwood 1988) has pro- duced a habitation layer of the early Metal phase that is firmly dated by radio- carbon to the early to middle first millennium AD. This layer is separated by an  interval of nonoccupation from the underlying Neolithic layer. The cave was  clearly intensively inhabited in the early Metal phase; several of the layers con- ~~=-Scm )  J  "  ( ' " C  --__ j ___ )  Fig. 9.17 A selection of vessels from Agop Alas.

The pottery (Fig. 9.17) has  basically the same rim and vessel forms as Leang Buidane, and the repertoire of  incised decoration, carved-paddle and corded impression, and burnished red  slip is quite similar between the two sites. The distinctive red-slipped and high- necked flasks also occur at Agop Atas and in another contemporary assemblage  from Hagop Bilo shelter in the nearby Baturong massif (Plate 60b). Other  objects found in Agop Atas include copper or bronze fragments, a forged iron  tanged spearhead, a small iron knife, and a few carnelian beads-the latter of  somewhat cruder manufacture than those from Buidane.  Jar burial assemblages of this phase in Sabah occur in Pusu Samang Tas Cave  in a remote part of the Madai massif (T. and B. Harrisson 1971) and in a cave in  the Tapadong massif on the Segama River (Harrisson 1965). The Tapadong  assemblage has produced eleven stone adzes with trapezoidal cross-sections,  plus a copper or bronze socketed axe and a casting valve of soft stone. This find  demonstrates that local casting was carried out, as in Talaud, although stone  adzes clearly continued in use well into the early Metal phase. Adzes identical  to those from Tapadong are also known from surface collections in Mindanao  (Lynch and Ewing 1968) and from the upper layer (late Neolithic, post-500 BC)  at Bukit Tengkorak.  The overall significance of the well-dated Agop Atas and Buidane assem- blages is that they demonstrate the existence of iron and copper/bronzework- ing, together with imported Indian beads and a style of decorated pottery  known to many authors as "Sa Huynh Kalanay" (after Solheim 1964a, 1967),  from a date probably quite early in the first millennium AD. The beads and the  available carbon dates make it difficult to push the beginnings of the early  Metal phase around the Sulawesi Sea back before AD 1, although the traditions  of jar burial and the friezes of incised decoration on pottery apparently go back  into the late Neolithic in Sarawak and Palawan (Chapter 7, Section III C).  C. The Central and Southern Philippines  The best-known ceramic and metal (copper/bronze and iron) complex of the  early Metal phase in the central Philippines is undoubtedly that termed Kalanay  by Solheim (1964b), from his excavations in Kalanay Cave on Masbate and  from earlier collections made by the Guthe Expedition. This material is not of  direct concern here, although it should be noted that the whole range shows  considerable similarity to the Agop Atas and Buidane assemblages.  The extensive complexes of caves on the west-central coast of Palawan  (including the Tabon Caves) have produced prolific jar burial assemblages that  still remain only partially published (Fox 1970; Kress 1978). Much of this mate- rial is virtually identical to that from Agop Atas and Buidane, although detailed  </page> <page sequence="36"> The Early Metal Phase 303  comparison remains impossible. Fox placed the beginnings of the jar burial tra- dition at Tabon with the Manunggul chamber A assemblage, which he dated to  the beginning of the first millennium BC on the basis of two radiocarbon dates.  This assemblage contained no metal, and Fox was therefore willing-perhaps  rightly-to place in it the Neolithic. The pottery is especially fine and appears to  lack the sharply carinated forms of the Tabon early Metal phase. However, it  does have at least one pottery coffin and some vessels have red-painted curvi- linear designs enclosed by incised lines-a technique well represented in the  three-color ware from Sarawak, in early Metal assemblages in Sabah, and also in  the Sa Huynh culture in southern Vietnam.  Although Fox suggested that copper and bronze objects first appeared in the  Palawan sequence at about 500 BC, the only dated site for the early Metal phase  at Tabon is Manunggul chamber B, which has a radiocarbon date of about 200  BC. This assemblage produced iron, glass bracelets, glass and carnelian beads,  and also five acid-etched agate beads similar to those from Leang Buidane.  Copper or bronze items occur in other jar burial caves in the area and include  socketed axes and spearheads, a tanged and barbed arrowhead, and a possible  barbed harpoon. Axe casting molds, gold beads, and jade lingling-o earrings  have also been found. In general, I suspect that the Tabon jar burial sequence  after analysis will resemble the sequence from the Sabah sites and belong  mainly in the first millennium AD.  Another central Philippine site worthy of mention is the open jar burial site  of Magsuhot on Negros Island, where Tenazas (1974) excavated three large  burial jars placed side by side in a large pit lined with broken potsherds. Pottery  of Kalanay type, human and animal figurines of baked clay, and bones of pig  and chicken were found with the jar burials, which were sealed in by an earth  fill. Only one jar contained human bones-of a young woman and two chil- dren. Another pit contained an enormous lidded burial jar with a weight of 52  kilograms, together with a pottery bone box and no fewer than seventy acces- sory vessels. The burial jar was connected to the surface by a tube of stacked  pots; it contained an iron knife but no identifiable bones. This site is of interest  because it reveals the wealth of information that can survive with undisturbed  jar burial sites and-while undated-it would fit well into a middle or late first  millennium AD context.  D. Southern Indonesia and Sulawesi  The most remarkable of the jar burial sites of Indonesia is undoubtedly the large  urnfield of Melolo on eastern Sumba. This open site was first investigated dur- ing the 1920s and 1930s and most recently in 1985 (Bintarti 1986). It has pro- duced an alignment of large, close-set burial urns with round-based vessels as  </page> <page sequence="37"> 304 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  lids, containing fragmentary secondary burials, stone adzes, stone and shell  beads, shell bracelets, and small accessory pots of which the only kind ade- quately reported is an elegant high-necked flask with incised geometric and  anthropomorphic designs filled in with a white paint (Heekeren 1956b) (Fig.  9.18). It appears that some of these flasks were provided with a burnished red  slip.  Some metal items have been found in the recent excavations, so Heekeren's  (1972:191) classification of the site as Neolithic appears to be incorrect. Some of  the Melolo flat-based flasks are paralleled precisely in the Buni pottery of west- ernJava (see Fig. 9.12), and the flask forms in general are paralleled in a number  of other sites of the early Metal phase, including Sembiran in Bali. I suspect that  this may be a significant observation for future research because the form is not,  to my knowledge, found in any Indo-Malaysian assemblage (outside Taiwan)  that can conclusively be considered as Neolithic. Indeed, the high-necked flask,  often with a globular body and sometimes a burnished red slip, can perhaps be  regarded as a clear marker of the early Metal phase; for example, at Leang  Buidane in Talaud, at Agop Atas and Hagop Bilo in Sabah, at Gunung Piring on  Lombok, at Leang Bua on Flores, at Batu Ejaya in southern Sulawesi, at Gili- manuk and Sembiran on Bali, and at Anyar in western Java (Plate 60). The form  clearly transcends local cultural areas, and at Gilimanuk, Leang Bua, and Gunung  Piring it is found in association with inhumation rather than jar burials.  Melolo is really the only jar burial site in eastern Indonesia that merits close  attention at present, although a related site called Lambanapu in eastern Sumba  is currently under investigation. However, there are some further generaliza- tions about the early Metal phase in the archipelago as a whole that can be  made. First, it is clear that the sites around the Sulawesi and Sulu Seas-the  Tabon Caves, the "Kalanay" sites, and the sites of eastern Sabah and Talaud-do  share quite closely related pottery assemblages with iron and copper/ bronze dur- ing the first millennium AD. Jar burial is the predominant rite in this region;  another common characteristic is the small pottery bone box.  In southern Indonesia the picture becomes rather more confused and here  comprises the relatively "pure" jar burial site at Melolo, the mixed-rite sites such  as Anyar, Plawangan, Gilimanuk, and also Gunung Piring on Lombok, which  appears to have only inhumations. Outside these two regions, on the islands of  Sumatra, Borneo (except Sabah), Sulawesi, and the central and southern Moluc- cas there are unfortunately many blanks, although jar burial assemblages from  caves in southern Sulawesi (Mulvaney and Soejono 1970, 1971) have bone  boxes and pottery loosely related to the Tabon-Sabah-Talaud sites that may date  within the first millennium AD. The pottery from the jar burial site of Ulu  Leang 2 in the Maros region of southern Sulawesi (Andrews and Glover 1986)  has produced pottery with zones of densely incised decoration like some from  </page> <page sequence="38"> Fig. 9.18 Flask with human face carved on neck from Melolo, Sumba. From Heekeren  1956b. Courtesy: Indonesian National Research Center for Archaeology.  </page> <page sequence="39"> 306 Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago  Sembiran in Bali. However, it is clear that even the most basic cultural and chro- nological framework for the early Metal phase does not yet exist for the great  bulk of the archipelago; until this is established, understanding of the period is  unlikely to advance very far.  The same observation still applies to the remarkable complex of large stone  jars and human statues in central Sulawesi (Kaudern 1938) (Plate 61). I have  little to add to my previous description of these monuments (Bellwood 1978:  228), and dates are still elusive, but an extensive survey in the Bada district to  the west of Lake Paso (Sukendar 1980) has brought to light more stone jars and  statues and demonstrated their association with iron and carved-paddle- impressed pottery. However, the absence of a chronological scheme for Sulawesi  prehistory subsequent to the Toalian industry makes accurate dating virtually  impossible, and the apparent absence of Chinese pottery can only suggest a  date older than 500 years.  E. The Origins of the Jar Burial Tradition  I have already discussed the evidence, of varying reliability, indicating that jar  burial was practiced in late Neolithic contexts at Niah in Sarawak and in the  Tabon Caves. Possible commencement dates fall in the late second and early  first millennia sc; if these dates are correct, they provide strong grounds for  regarding the tradition as an indigenous development in Island Southeast Asia.  However, it must still be realized that the bulk of the jar burial sites are certainly  not older than 200 sc.  Of course, no conclusive evidence exists to support a watertight case for or  against a local origin of the jar burial tradition, but some comparative observa- tions may be of interest. Although infant burial in jars occurs in some prehis- toric Chinese and Thai sites, it is apparent that the Southeast Asian mainland  prehistoric sequence (outside parts of Laos and southern Vietnam) is almost  totally devoid of this tradition and normally stressed extended inhumation in  post-Hoabinhian contexts.s On the other hand, a coherent tradition of jar burial  does occur in the late ]oman and Yayoi periods of southwestern Japan (1000 sc  to AD 300), where it appears that bones were often placed in two jars laid hori- zontally mouth-to-mouth (Mori 1956; Chard 1974). Although this pattern is  not to my knowledge found in the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago, there are records  of vertical mouth-to-mouth jar burials on Batan Island between Luzon and Tai- wan (Solheim 1960), at Plawangan on Java (Sukendar and Awe 1981), and at  Gilimanuk on Bali (Soejono 1969:Plate 24). In addition, the Yayoi pottery style,  which is different in many respects from that of the preceding ]oman periods,  does include flasks, cutouts in ring feet, red-slipped surfaces, and incised scroll  patterns that overlap to some extent with the repertoire of the early Metal  </page> <page sequence="40"> The Early Metal Phase 307  phase in the Philippines. While I would not suggest Japan as a source for the  Indo-Malaysian jar burials, I do feel that some degree of contact between the  two archipelagic regions may have taken place from the late first millennium  BC onward.  In India there is a widespread tradition of mouth-to-mouth urn burial in  Chalcolithic sites spread across the country from Karnataka to West Bengal, but  of more relevance is the tradition of burial in single upright urns found in asso- ciation with the Black and Red pottery of the Iron Age cultures of southern  India and Sri Lanka. Many specific features of this tradition-the practice of sec- ondary burial with grave goods in the urns, the use of bone boxes and legged  coffins, and the occasional occurrence of stone jar lids (as in some Philippine  sites)-clearly do have definite Indo-Malaysian parallels. The historical and  archaeological data already reviewed indicate that Indian contact with South- east Asia was taking place from perhaps the middle of the first millennium sc  onward, so some exchange of ideas may have been occurring. However, it is  also apparent that the basic artifact forms, especially in metal and pottery, differ  so considerably between the two regions that an actual Indian source for the  Indo-Malaysian jar burials would be unthinkable. I am therefore still strongly  inclined to keep to my previous conclusion (Bellwood 1978:213) that the Aus- tronesian jar burial tradition was an indigenous development.  </page> </plain_text>
