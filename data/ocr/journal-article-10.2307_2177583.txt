Palermo, Reno Sandron, i905. -Vol. I, pp. 762; Vol. II, PP. 470, CCXXV, 273. The first of these Essays on the Theory of Knowledge appeared in 1898. Its special title was IISui limiti e l'oggetto della conoscenza a priori." This careful study of the limits and object of a ripor knowledge paved the way for the more comprehensive examination of the philosophy of meta- physics now presented in the second essay. It was widely recognized at the time as a very able defense of empiricism from a new point of view. Even critics who were not able to accept the author's fundamental positions freely expressed their admiration for his extensive reading, wealth of ideas, vigorous reasoning, and constructive power. An inquiry into the nature of abstract ideas had led Professor Guastella to a radical and consistent nominalism. He not only found himself in agreement with Roscelinus, Abolard, and Occam on the general thesis that universalia sun! nomina, but was also forced by an inexorable logic to admit certain corollaries of this position which would have made the boldest medieval thinker pause. He was obliged to reject conceptualism in every form, the so-called I syn- thetic judgment,' every vestige of metaphysics. If the universals are only words, with no objective reality corresponding to them, all knowledge originates in sense-perception, proceeds from experience, grows with obser- vation and interpretation of the sense-given material. Af5riori knowledge of the real is impossible. Simultaneousness and succession, the marks of the phenomenal world, can only be known a posterior. The truths of mathematics may be known a triori, because this science deals solely with the categories of similarity and dissimilarity. Of the second essay, dealing with the Philosophy of Metaphysics, the present volumes form only the first part. Its special subject is Efficient Cause. According to the general plan, this is to be followed by a second part dealing with the metaphysical concepts involved in the question of the external world, or things-in-themselves, and a third part dealing with the metaphysical concepts in psychology, ethics, and law. As the remaining parts are likely to claim as much space as the first, which contains over two thousand pages, we may possibly have to wait some time for the comple- tion of the work. But students of philosophy will welcome each part that is issued. Having stated the object of the second essay, and especially that of its first part, in a chapter on Empirical Causes and Meta-empirical Causes, Professor Guastella deals in six chapters with Anthropomorphism, The 9I</page><page sequence="2">92 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVI. Mechanical or Impulsionist Philosophy, Origin and Development of the Idea of Efficient Cause, the Doctine of the Unknowable and the Idea of Efficient Cause, the a triori Philosophy, and Dialectical Realism. There is a supplement of over three hundred pages on the Immanence of the Platonic Ideas, and another on the Pythagoreanism of Plato and his disciples, Xenocrates and Speusippus, and a deeply interesting appendix of over two hundred pages on the theme "I Nihil oritur, nihil interit." Under the caption of Anthropomorphism, the author discusses Theo logical Philosophy, Animism as an Explanation of Biological Phenomena, Hylozoism, Panpsychism, Idealism, and the Concept of Causality sug- gested by Anthropomorphism. The distinction between what Professor Guastella calls panpsychism and idealism, on the one hand, and hylo- zoism, on the other, may be useful, even though there is a certain inevi- table artificiality in the groupings of philosophical systems that result from the adoption of such a principle of classification. Each of the numerous systems examined is shown to rest upon anthropomorphism. This is regarded by the author as Fufficient to discredit it. Nor can there be any doubt that the tendency to assimilate the less known to the better known, the phenomena of nature to those of the human mind, has been a fruitful source of palpable errors. It has peopled the heavens and the earth with beings that never had any objective existence, and has established impor- tant moral relations between these unsubstantial creatures made in the image of man and their living creators. It has made of abstract thoughts objective realities, and fancied that it found in them the explanation of the sensible universe. But when this has been freely granted, the question still arises whether the tendency which led the immature mind too far afield, beyond the bounds of reality, may not, after all, have impelled it in the right direc- tion. Is the assumption of a similarity between the world without and the world within really nothing but a sophism ? Does not the conception of man as a microcosm, presenting in his own constitution and development an index, as it were, of nature's elements and forces, rest upon the data of empirical science ? Is there a more vital part of the doctrine of evolution than the affirmation of man's kinship with other types in the ascending scale of existence ? It does not seem necessary to abandon the fundamental positions of Professor Guastella's philosophy in order frankly to recognize in the assimilation of the processes of external nature to those of the human mind something more than an idle play of sophistry, namely, a sense of the unity underlying all the multitudinous phenomena. How far the world in reality is anthropomorphous is a fair question. Is will, will, or thought, thought, only when raised to its highest known potency, in man? What are things-in-themselves ? To this last question the author will address himself in the second part of this essay. It will be interesting to see how well he can steer his course between some form of the materialism he rejects and some form of the panpsychism he likewise discards.</page><page sequence="3">No. i.] NVOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 93 Professor Guastella recognizes no efficient cause except the antecedent in an invariable sequence, and accounts for the origin and growth of the meta- empirical conception of an efficient cause by a tendency on man's part to find in his own voluntary and mechanical action an explanation of this natural sequence. In reality, he observes, human volition is a rare and exceptional phenomenon, which plays a scarcely perceptible part in nature's economy. There is no doubt about the existence of such a tendency, and the warning against allowing it to obscure our vision is legitimate. But the reader misses a statement of the exact relation between what is will in man and what seems will in nature outside him. Does human volition fall within a larger category, or is man's genetic connection to be ignored? In the pitiable state of our knowledge concerning any other part of the uni- verse than our own little planet, are we prepared to affirm that volition, even of the kind displayed by man, is such a quantite ntiglgeable in the sum of things? A convinced opponent of all scepticism and agnosticism, the author sees in the quest for the ultimate reality of things only another form of the resort to a meta-empirical efficient cause, and in Spencer's idea of the Unknow- able essentially the same demand for a causation not warranted by scien. tific observation. It may be questioned whether the estimate is just in either case. One may be forced by what seem valid considerations to the conclusion that things are not in themselves what they'appear to our senses, without the slightest inclination to introduce supra-mundane causes. It is also possible to recognize no other efficient cause than the antecedent in an invariable sequence, and yet to acknowledge certain inevitable limitations of our knowledge. While dogmatism is, of course, out of place, and it is as presumptuous to affirm that man will never know as to declare that he will know what at present eludes the grasp of his mind, there does not seem to be any means of determining how far the vast realms which to-day extend beyond the reach of his inquiring intellect may be known to him in coming ages, or whether to the end of his existence on earth he shall con- tinue to be baffled by problems he cannot solve and aspects of reality he may not know. Is the a fipori method inadmissible in dealing with the phenomenal world ? Professor Guastella bars it out ; and there is much force in his contention that, influenced by the imposing certainty of mathematical reasoning, philosophers have sometimes raised a false and inapplicable standard, and unconsciously have substituted for the real world a world of their own creation. The inductive method has been the great instrument by which our age has gained its peculiar estimate of nature, and by which its validity must always be tested. But it seems to the reviewer that its significance is exaggerated, when the deductive method is declared to be wholly out of place in the natural sciences. The two methods supplement each other. By induction the hypothesis is suggested, the law is found; by deduction from the law, facts are surmised, predictions are made.</page><page sequence="4">94 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVI. When the discovery of a new planet at a certain distance from the sun, a new chemical element of a certain specific gravity, or the skeleton of a four-toed horse among the fossil inclusions of a certain geological stratum, is predicted, it is a brilliant deduction from a law whose validity is assumed. When the prophecy is fulfilled, the confidence in the law's validity is enhanced by the possibility of such a firiori statement of fact. The most common form of a jrzori reasoning is seen in the deductions constantly made from the assumed uniformity of nature. This grandest of all affirmations is entirely out of proportion to our limited individual experience, or even all recorded human experience. It was suggested by experience, but no human experience could be sufficient to prove it. Nevertheless, it approves itself to our minds, because it permits us to pre- dict how nature will behave. There was, after all, a soul of truth in rationalism that must not be allowed to perish. No departure from the realm of experience is, indeed, implied in the double process of inferring general laws from facts observed and then deducing from these laws new facts. For the apprehension by our reason of a rational order is a part of our experience, and the deduction does not become absolutely convincing until the fact foreseen is actually discovered. Professor Guastella's treatment of dialectical realism is vigorous and elucidating. Of great interest is the conclusion of his supplement on the immanence of the Platonic ideas. Plato complained that none of his dis- ciples understood his teaching as to the ideas. The following reason is assigned for Aristotle's uncertainty. He realized that the Platonic ideas could only be conceived as separate from things, and that consequently Plato's hypothesis of their immanence was a logical impossibility and a contradiction; but he was also impressed by the strong efforts of his teacher to give a place to the ideas in the things themselves by identifying the former with the attributes of the latter. He remained in doubt, because the degree of psychological reflection necessary to solve the difficulty was not possible to attain, even by an Aristotle, in an age when the human spirit was just beginning seriously to contemplate its own activities and nature. Professor Guastella is a clear and forceful thinker, and the lucidity and strength of his manner of writing reflect these characteristics of his thought. The meaning is never obscure; the style, though inclined to breadth, is never verbose or repetitious; the language is invariably apt, dignified, and graceful. It is with profound interest we look forward to the remaining parts of this work. NATHANIEL SCHMIDT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
