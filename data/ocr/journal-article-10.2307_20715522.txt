<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ANALYSIS OF CHILDREN'S METAPHORICAL STATEMENTS USED IN DESCRIBING A THREE DIMENSIONAL MODEL Cynthia B. Colbert University of South Carolina In a study originally designed to deter mine what relationships existed between young children's drawn and verbal de scriptions of a three dimensional model, over one third of the subjects included metaphorical statements in their verbal descriptions. The number and variety of the spontaneously produced metaphors made a separate analysis of metaphor use necessary to complete the analysis of the subjects' verbal responses. The analysis of the subjects' drawn and ver bal descriptions was based on accuracy and attention to detail of the model. The analysis of the metaphorical responses was also based on accuracy in describing the salient characteristics of the model, as well as the subjects' motivations for responding to the model in a metaphor ical rather than literal manner. Attention was also given to the developmental pat terns of the subjects' metaphor produc tion in describing the model. Metaphor is a figure of speech in which a term is transferred from the object it ordinarily designates to an object it may designate only by implicit comparison or analogy. Simply put, it is saying one thing and meaning another, while expecting to be understood to mean the other (Langer, 1957). According to Langer (1957), a met aphor is not language, but it is an idea which may be expressed by language, an idea that in its turn functions as a symbol to express something. The origin of metaphorical thought is in the na ture of perception and metaphor is evi dence of "abstractive seeing" and of the power of the mind to use presentational symbols. Brown (1958) also emphasized the per ceptual bias for metaphor by suggesting that words involving sensation (like warm, cold and soft) are often applied to per sonalities as dual-functioning adjectives based on sense data rather than linguistic information. Paivio has written of the role of imagery in the comprehension of met aphor, saying that imaginai representa tions have those properties that would account for the integrated representa tions that appear to emerge when a met aphor is understood. He further ex plained that mental imagery constructs synchronously organized, integrated structures which are analogous to the continuous structural layout of the per ceptual world (Paivio, 1979). Children's use of language in a "non literal" or metaphorical fashion is not unusual. Metaphors are produced by young children in the very beginnings of language acquisition. Children usually ac quire words with respect to some partic ular frame of reference and without an awareness of the conventional range of application for the new word. As situa tions arise, children must try to find words to apply to them. Often the use of a new word will conform with the conventional application of the word, and often the word will be overgeneralized and applied in a nonstandard way, producing a met aphor (Rummelhart, 1979). Children's language acquisition process should not be viewed as a process of first learning the literal language and after thoroughly mastering it, moving on to nonliteral, met aphorical language use (Rummelhart, 1979). It appears that some metaphorical language is a result of simply not having acquired the proper or conventional word to use in a given situation. Nonlinguistic metaphor may be found in the symbolic 54 ? 1982 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois 0160-3221/82/0016-0054$0.70/0</page><page sequence="2">play of young children. When a child uses a shoe to represent a truck, the shoe is a metaphor for the truck. The shoe serves as a metaphor only during the child's symbolic playing. Although studies of children's meta phoric competence indicate that children produce metaphoric language at an early age, the ability to appreciate metaphor appears to be an aspect of metaphoric competence which occurs later than met aphor production. In a study by Gardner, Winner, Kirchner, and Perkins (1975), chil dren's preference for appropriate meta phors was found to increase with age. When given choices for ending similes, primary school children preferred non metaphoric endings, pr?adolescents pre ferred conventional metaphors, and col lege students preferred appropriate metaphors as endings. In a study which required children to match verbal statements to pictures, Win ner (1978) found that preschoolers pre ferred the literal pictures, second graders preferred metaphoric pictures, and fourth graders preferred metaphoric pictures. When children were asked to make sec ond choices, preschoolers most often chose the adjective picture, which indi cated that the metaphoric picture was not preferred by preschoolers, even when two choices were given. The findings of this study indicate that a rise in meta phoric comprehension occurred between 6-8 years and leveled off between 8-10 years. In another study by Winner (1978), children were asked to make metaphoric matches between pictorial stimuli and they were also asked to perform verbal matchings of concrete verbal phrases as well as matchings of abstract words. Winner's findings indicate that children more easily perceive metaphoric matches visually than linguistically. Winner sug gests that metaphoric relations are pos sibly perceived nonverbally before they are translated into words. Metaphors enable children to transfer learning and understanding of what is well-known to what is less well-known in a vivid and memorable way (Petrie, 1979). The association between the well-known and the less well-known asserts a rela tion between imageability and learning (Paivio, 1971). When educators begin the learning process with what children know or have experienced, a problem develops in bridging the gap between what is known and the new information which is to be learned. Metaphor can serve as one way of "leaping the epistemologica! chasm between old knowledge and radically new knowledge" as it "provides a rational bridge from the known to the unknown, from a given context of understanding to a changed context of understanding" (Petrie, 1979, p. 441). The analysis of children's metaphorical statements made in describing a three dimensional model were based on the interaction view of metaphor which is summarized as follows: 1. A metaphorical statement has two dis tinct subjects, to be identified as the "primary" subject and the "second ary" subject. 2. The secondary subject is to be re garded as a system rather than an individual thing. 3. The metaphorical utterance works by "projecting upon" the primary subject a set of "associated implications," comprised in the implicative complex, that are predictable of the secondary subject. 4. The maker of a metaphorical state ment selects, emphasizes, sup presses and organizes features of the primary subject by applying to it state ments isomorphic with the members of the secondary subject's implicative complex. 5. In the context of a particular meta phorical statement, the two subjects interact in the following ways: (a) the presence of the primary subject in cites the hearer to select some of the secondary subject's properties; and (b) invites him to construct a parallel implication-complex that can fit the Analysis of Metaphor 55</page><page sequence="3">primary subject; and (c) reciprocally induces parallel changes in the sec ondary subject (Black, 1979, p. 29). Method Subjects. The subjects participating in this study were students in a rural mid western elementary school which was chosen as the site for this investigation due to the administration's willingness to cooperate with the extensive data col lection necessary to the investigation. Subjects were from middle, upper middle and lower middle-class families. Seventy-eight of the total 106 subjects participating in the drawing/verbal de scription study responded verbally and 32 of those 78 subjects responded met aphorically. The data from those 32 sub jects; 18 males and 14 females ranging in age from 5 to 10 years was used in the analysis of metaphorical statements. Each subject was tested individually in a private, controlled situation. Two ex perimenters were present, one talked with the subject and one was positioned nearby to record the subjects' gestural responses to the wooden model. The wooden model was designed to offer subjects a number of easily ob servable and describable features. Par ticular attention was given to the design of structural features of the model which include a sloping upper left corner, dow els coming from the top and upper frontal surfaces, a missing wedge on the frontal surface and a IV2 inch circular hole in the frontal surface. Surface decoration of the model includes unique black and white patterns and textures. In several cases, patterns and textures were used in repetition on the model to test subjects' descriptive powers in explaining specifi cally which features are being described. Subjects were encouraged to pick up the model, turn it around and look it over carefully. Subjects were then asked to imagine that they needed to describe the model to a friend or parent who had not had the opportunity to see it. They were asked to think of all information that the person who had not seen the model would need in order to imagine the model as completely as possible. Of the total 106 subjects participating in the original drawing/verbal description investigation, 78 were asked to respond verbally; 26 responded with only a verbal description; 26 responded verbally and later by drawing; 26 responded by draw ing and later by verbally describing the model. Verbal responses were audio re corded. Instrumentation. Verbal responses were transcribed from audio tape and then scored for accuracy by 2 independent judges who gave numerical credit for details included in the descriptions. The metaphorical statements were then com piled and evaluated using a systematic breakdown of attributes suggested by the metaphors in relation to the salient char acteristics of the model or model feature being described. The metaphor-produc ing subjects received credit for each fea ture contained on the model which was implied by their metaphors. In order to score the metaphorical responses, judges had to first list the metaphor's attributes and then compare them with the features of the model. One example is the meta phor which was used by 2 subjects to represent 3 dowels of varying heights which are located on the top of the model, perpendicular to its edge. "The model has smokestacks coming out of the top," can be broken down using a system similar to Black's (1979) analysis of how metaphorical statements work. "The model has smokestacks coming out of the top." (51) A smokestack is a large chimney or vertical pipe through which com bustion vapors, gases and smoke are discharged. (52) Smokestacks are hollow. (53) Smokestacks are often cylindrical. (54) Smokestacks are generally perpen dicular to the roof line. (D1) Dowels are vertically placed, per 56 Cynthia . Colbert</page><page sequence="4">pendicular to the top and bottom edge of the model and do come out of the top. (Credit 3) (D2) Dowels are cylindrically shaped. (Credit 1) (D3) Dowels are solid, not hollow. (D4) Dowels on the model have a variety of heights. Another metaphor produced by a sub ject in relation to the dowels was "It (the model) has 3 towers coming out of the top. There's a little, a middle sized tower... there's another tall tower." (T1) A tower is an exceptionally tall part of a building or a tall framework or structure, the elevation of which is functional, as for observation or sig naling. (T2) A tall, medium, and small tower ap pear on top of the model. (D1) The dowels are structures which may resemble towers (tall and thin) and they do come out of the top of the model. (Credit 2; 1 shape and 1 location). (D2) Dowels do have 3 sizes, short, me dium and tall. (Credit 3) Results Of the 78 subjects responding verbally to the model, 32 or 41% responded with at least one metaphorical statement. Of the 41% responding metaphorically, 6 were first graders, 7 were second grad ers, 8 were third graders, and 11 were fourth graders. The developmental trend suggests that older children are more likely to use metaphor in describing visual stimuli. One fourth grade male subject produced 4 metaphors in his verbal de scription of the model, which was more than any other subject produced. The type of metaphors produced also differed in relation to age groups. First and second graders made 6 metaphors for a string which comes from a hole in the lower right side of the model, calling it a "tail." This tendency to anthropo morphize was repeated by only two older subjects who referred to the dowels as "noses" and "fingers," but no subject over 7 years of age referred to the string as a "tail." Different parts of the model called for a metaphorical response more often than others, perhaps due to the subjects' lack of the conventional term for the part being described. The dowels on the top of the model evoked 29 metaphors which were easily divided into categories: ar chitectural, biological, anthropomorphic, and miscellaneous. The model itself evoked four metaphors, being called a "house," a "machine," a "stove," and a "bag puppet." The sloping upper left corner of the otherwise rectangular fron tal face of the model was called a "slide" twice and a "ramp" twice. One subject employed metaphor to de scribe the dowels on the top and on the front of the model and differentiated the locations by referring to those on top as "smokestacks" and those on front as "bicycle handles." Three independent judges participated in the analysis of subjects' metaphorical responses for strength and appropriate ness in describing the model features. Judges generated lists of attributes which were suggested by the metaphors and later scored this list against a list of attributes which had been generated for every feature of the model. The inter rater agreement on the strength scoring was consistently above .84. The strength of the metaphors in comparison to the actual model features varied. In the case of metaphors produced to describe the dowels located on the top of the model, scores ranged from 5 to 0. The 6 meta phors judged most appropriate in de scribing the dowels were "poles," "smokestacks," "fingers," "round stems," "tubes," and "chimneys." Third and fourth grade subjects produced the metaphors judged to be the strongest descriptors of the dowels. First and second grade subjects consistently produced less ap Analysis of Metaphor 57</page><page sequence="5">propriate metaphors for the dowels than the third and fourth grade subjects. First grade subjects produced only one met aphor in response to the dowels. The number of metaphors produced for the dowels located at the top of the model appeared to be a result of their similarity in appearance to other objects with which subjects had experience. Per haps just as often, the production of metaphor for the dowels located on the top of the model was a result of subjects' lack of a conventional term to use in reference to the dowels. The term "dowel" was not used in any verbal descriptions of the model. Literal descrip tions made by subjects utilized the term "sticks" or "those things" to refer to the dowels located on the top of the model. Eight subjects (3 fourth grade, 3 third grade, and 2 second grade subjects) asked the experimentors what the name for those "sticks," "things," "smoke stacks," "chimneys," or "towers" was. The 6 metaphoric responses to the braided string which comes from a hole on the right side of the model were "tail," and each of those responses came from first and second graders. Also the met aphoric response for the missing upper left corner for first and second graders was "slide" and for third and fourth grad ers it was "ramp." One strong descriptive metaphor produced by a young child was "bullseye" for 2 concentric circles lo cated at the end of a dowel on the frontal face of the model. A literal description was generally "a small circle inside of a circle." Another strong descriptive metaphor was produced by a fourth grade male subject for the small wooden block on the lower left corner of the model. The subject referred to it as a jewelry box .. . "you know the kind you buy a necklace in," and that description tells the listener a great deal about the size and shape of a box which is located "catycorner to the lower left corner, and about 2 inches in, diagonally." Discussion The analysis of metaphor grew from a need to access metaphors which were spontaneously produced by young chil dren when they were instructed to ver bally describe a three dimensional model. The evaluation of verbal responses was not possible without a method to evaluate the metaphors for strength of accurate description. The developmental trend exhibited even in a sample of 78 verbal respondents seems to indicate that the metaphors produced by older children serve as strong descriptors of visual stimuli. The difference in strength of metaphors pro duced by younger and older children might be attributed to the older child's facility with language and additional experiences with which they may link visual stimuli. Strength was not the only developmental difference noted in the type of metaphors produced by subjects of different ages. Younger children produced metaphors which suggested that they saw the model or parts of the model as an animal form, whereas older children produced meta phors which suggested that they saw the model as an architectural form. The motivation for metaphor produc tion appeared to fall into two categories: (1) metaphor used as a compact way of representing perceptual features that are important; and (2) metaphor used to en able the subject to talk about a feature that he or she can not literally describe, primarily due to having no conventional label for it. After verbally describing the model, several subjects asked the ex perimenters what the name was for the model and for the dowels. Children who produced metaphors in their description of the model did not necessarily score higher in their verbal descriptions than children who described the model literally. A literal description of the dowels located on the top of the model by a 7-year-old subject follows: "On the top of it... it has these rounded wooden sticks that are painted white. 58 Cynthia . Colbert</page><page sequence="6">There's a tall and a thin one, a medium one, and a real short and fat one." A metaphorical description which is equally accurate was used by an 8-year-old sub ject: "Three white wooden smokestacks come out of the top ... one is tall and one is medium and they are both thin . . . one is very short and thick." A numerical score of 10 was credited to both of the subjects for the descriptions of dowels. Metaphor is not always a better way of describing, but it is a dif ferent way of explaining how an object looks. Metaphor was utilized by subjects to offer succinct descriptions of spatial re lationships and structural or surface dif ferences which may have been difficult to describe in conventional, literal verbal form. That 41% of the subjects respond ing verbally to a visual form chose to use at least one metaphorical statement in their descriptions may add support to Winner's findings (1978a) which indicated that children more easily perceive met aphoric matches visually than linguisti cally. Perhaps it was the responding to the visual form to which subjects made spontaneous visual or imaginai associ ations and which provoked subjects to make a metaphoric verbal response. Pai vio indicated that imagery plays a role in the comprehension of metaphor (1979) and that the association between the well-known and the less well-known as serts a relationship between imageability and learning (1971). The associations made by children between the physical features of the less-known to them as serts a use of imagery. The translation of those images or perceptions into ver bal language by the subjects required cognitive functioning. The metaphors spontaneously pro duced by subjects in this investigation were often accurate in depicting model features. Metaphor appeared to be used by subjects to bridge the gap between what was well-known and what was less well-known. A subject's use of metaphor also generated insight about how an am biguous three dimensional model can stimulate children to utilize information from their own experiences in creating unique verbal descriptions.
