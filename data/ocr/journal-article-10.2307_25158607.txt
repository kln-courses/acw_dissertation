The passion ate quest for knowledge that characterized the Enlightenment was a primary impulse behind these grand voyages of discovery, in which scientists and navigators joined to explore distant lands?to sur vey their shores, to study their flora, fauna, and native peoples, to assess their commercial possibil ities. Careful observation, measurement, and des cription were vital to their studies, and in an age that knew nothing of photography, artists were relied on to record the marvels encountered.1 In the late summer of 1786, when the French explorer Jean-Frangois de Galaup, Comte de la Perouse, came to anchor off Monterey, he had among his staff three able artists. Two of them, J. R. Prevost and his uncle, were charged with "executing drawings of whatever related to natu ral history/' while Gaspard Duche de Vancy, the official "draughtsman of landscapes and figures," had been directed "to take views of all remarkable places and countries, portraits of the natives of different parts, their dresses, ceremonies, games, buildings, boats and vessels," if La Perouse thought they would "render the descriptions more intel ligible."2 Alejandro Malaspina, commander of the Spanish voyage of discovery that visited this lonely rim of Christendom five years later, also relied on artists to give visual form to his observations, as did the famed navigator George Vancouver, who came to California on three occasions between 1792 and 1794. Although the draftsmen with Vancouver were amateurs?those "officers and young gen tlemen of the quarter-deck" who showed a talent for drawing?they produced accurate topogra phical profiles of the coastline and faithful scenic views of Monterey and environs. Copied and strengthened by a professional artist upon the expe dition's return to England, these images appeared as engravings in Vancouver's Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean, and Round the World (1798), giving Europeans and Americans their first look at this golden land.3 Later explorers and visitors added to this found ing series of images, documenting the course of history beneath the flags of Spain, Mexico, and ultimately the United States. One cannot but delight in the glimpses of a long-lost world revealed in this pictorial record, which stretches from the draw ings of the German-born naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff, who in 1806 visited the province with Nikolai Rezanov, to the views of William R. Hutton, a paymaster's clerk with the troops that fulfilled the dreams of American expansionists. Among the most charming and important images executed over these many years were those of Richard Beechey. A son of the prominent British portrait painter Sir William Beechey, the young midshipman was one of two amateur artists aboard the vessel of discovery H.M.S. Blossom, which in November 1826 anchored in California waters. In the course of two sojourns, Beechey produced a series of watercolors that are superb examples of romantic expeditionary art, carefully rendered views enlivened with picturesque detail and sug gestive of the artist's emotional response to the scene. Especially appealing is Presidio of San Fran cisco, New California (fig. 2), a lyrical impression of the easy harmony of man and nature in this new country, which shows, as well, the lack of develop ment that so disturbed the artist's half-brother, SPRING 1992 3</page><page sequence="3">jfc0 i Jh_I_I__^_B_HI ^_flH_tf m1_%Ji_h_I_^_^_BH_hI &lt;||h * fall^HHMI ;': ^V^ I |__^__^__^__^_M_l_B_0-^r^-Wi--^i-B_l-^-B--^-^-l-^_l^^ __W_B___B_-_-_----------__fc___m ' ' T ?S____|^__^^H|j l^^^^^^^^^^^^^B.B-----.fSlB-Ml-^ _A_ffi_HwH_l_^_H l_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^H_^_X__!__l_l_^B__^^ l_R-_i_^_i_^_^_H-_^_fi--___________________l__^^ ""' -'^ *;^$]l l__HH__[-----H-----------------------HH-----------------------H 'rtiLJ_^iiCstjtf^.iJ lla^MB^BM^BBW__M_l_^ Figure 2: Richard Beechey, Presidio of San Francisco, New California, 1826.

In the middle distance, set against a magnificent landscape of bay waters and coastal hills, stand the "dilapidated walls" of the presidio, with its rusty cannon and crumbling enclosure, one side of which "was broken down, and little better than a heap of rubbish and bones, on which jackals, dogs, and vultures were constantly preying."4 Even before expeditionary artists visited Califor nia, however, Spanish friars had begun to adorn their rude mission churches with murals, and much earlier still, the native tribes had evolved their own complex pictorial tradition of decorating cave walls and rock outcroppings with painted designs. The most spectacular pictographs were created along the Santa Barbara Channel, particularly inland, hidden in the rugged canyons and ravines of the Coast Range. Here, as elsewhere in Califor nia, complex geometric shapes and simpler angu lar and curvilinear elements greatly outnumber anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures. Anthro pologists believe the images of game animals were associated with hunting magic, while the abstract designs may have been "visualizations of super natural beings or forces."5 Part of long forgotten ceremonials, these pictographs and those of other tribes are as fascinating as they are mysterious, providing a bond at once enduring and enigmatic with ancient aboriginal peoples. Under Hispanic rule, the most extensive expres sion of artistry was in the Franciscan missions, where the Indians assisted the friars and the occa sional craftsman with mural painting. Most of the murals were meant to represent, or at least sug gest, a highly ornamental architecture that, owing to a lack of skilled artisans and financial means, could not be realized on the California frontier. In the mission churches, representations of columns along the walls of the nave were among the most common decorations. Floral motifs and geometric 4 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="4">designs were often incorporated into friezes, and at times murals depicted textile designs, taking the place of tapestries on the wall. Invariably, the most ambitious decorations were the painted altar screens, which in Spain and Mexico were often richly carved and gilded, adorned with polychromed figures and sumptuous pictures. In California, on the far reaches of the Hispanic bor derlands, these retablos were inevitably simpler. Some were sent north from Mexico, but most were made locally, such as the example at Mission San Miguel, which along with the nave walls was ornately painted about 1820 by Estevan Munras, with the assistance of several neophytes (fig. 3). Although the work here is simple and rude by all but the most provincial standards, it bears witness to history and human aspiration. It tells of the Franciscans' impassioned desire to reproduce the familiar forms of a world left behind and of the hard conditions of the California frontier that pre vented their hopes from being completely realized.6 In 1847, when Andres Pico signed the Cahuenga Capitulation, recognizing the triumph of Ameri can arms, the fine arts no longer flourished in California. As a useful craft dedicated to the glory of God, painting had withered a decade earlier with the secularization of the missions. The prac tice of art was now a genteel diversion, a source of pleasure for Alfred Robinson, Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, and a few other residents who liked to draw. Yet within a year, the chance discovery of gold in the raceway of John Sutter's sawmill precipitously changed the course of California history, creating overnight a complex, cosmo politan society where the fine arts could take root and flourish. San Francisco, which would be the art center of California and the entire Far West until well after the turn of the century, was in early 1847 a village of perhaps sixty adobe and frame build ings ranged along a couple of dusty streets. A census taken in June revealed a population of less than five hundred souls, including three hotel keep ers, eleven merchants, one cigar maker, and one brewer. Social life in this ragged town revolved around the Leidesdorff Hotel and the Portsmouth House, where the townsfolk "gathered after night fall in the two billiard rooms, sending the balls right and left, tossing off their buenos salutos in foreign wines or native aguardiente, smoking their Figure 3: Estevan Munras, Retablo and Mural Decorations, Mission San Miguel, ca. 1820. Tempera on wood and plaster. Photograph by Anthony Kirk. long-nines, cheroots and cigarettos, listlessly cut ting their names on chair backs and window-sills, or dozing in corner seats."7 The simple, idyllic life of Old California was shattered, however, by the great migration of gold hunters that gathered momentum in late 1848 and reached flood tide proportions the next year. Peri odic fires and seasonal movements to the mines imposed an irregular development on San Francisco in the early years, but all observers agreed that change occurred with astonishing swiftness. Arriv ing in August 1849, Bayard Taylor found "a scatter ing town of tents and canvas houses, with a show of frame buildings on one or two streets, and a SPRING 1992 5</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4: William H. Dougal, San Francisco in 1850, 1850. Pencil heightened with white gouache on paper, 7 x 31 Vs in. _ Courtesy Bancroft Library. population of about six thousand." By his last visit, in December, it was "an actual metropolis, dis playing street after street of well-built edifices, filled with an active and enterprising people and exhibit ing every mark of permanent commercial prosper ity." A year later, when the forty-niner William Dougal trudged up the slopes of what later would be called Nob Hill and made a drawing of the city spread below, he needed three sheets of paper to take in its entire sweep (fig. 4). An accomplished engraver from Washington, D.C, Dougal meticu lously documented the countless buildings that now stood between Rincon Hill and North Beach, showing, in addition, the flotilla of ships anchored in Yerba Buena Cove, many of them abandoned, the crews having deserted for the gold fields.8 Among the great crush of Argonauts who came pouring into California when word of James Mar shall's fabulous discovery spread 'round the world were several score painters, engravers, and lithog raphers. A few, such as John W. Audubon, son of the celebrated artist and naturalist, anticipated splendid opportunities for drawing in the western wilderness. But most of them had not come to practice their profession. They were here, as the saying went, "to see the elephant." George H. Baker, for example, was a struggling young artist in New York City, when in December 1848 President Polk officially confirmed rumors of an American El Dorado. Though Baker had faith in his prospects, he realized that "reputation and standing" in New York were "yet to be acquired by long years of diligence and industry." Young and impatient, he was easily swept up in the excite ment that followed Polk's message and, going to his native Boston, joined with eleven other adven turers in a mining company. Early the next year, after being admonished to hold fast to their " 'New England Principles' and not to leave one in exchange for every lump of gold taken out," they set off for California.9 Baker, who was eager to reach the mines, tarried but briefly upon arriving in San Francisco (though long enough to make a drawing of the town that in August appeared on the front page of the New York Tribune). Once in the diggings, however, he discovered a miner was "one who endures many hardships, suffers many privations, and ventures his health, in measure, for the golden 6 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="6">Bgaga||aB|a - &gt; - hope of gain, and often it amounts to only that, as some return with injured health and empty pockets." After a week's labor on the north fork of the American River, "satisfied with having seen the 'elephant,'" Baker retired from mining. He subsequently engaged in other ventures and then about 1852 took up where he had left off when struck by gold fever, building a career as an artist and a lithographer that stretched on into the next century.10 Baker's experience was not untypical, though most made more of a show at mining than did he. J. D. Borthwick, a Scots artist who arrived in 1850, spent enough time in the diggings to write with authority of long toms and rockers and wing dams in his memorable Three Years in California (1857). He also knew the wide range of life in the gold fields ?the miners' wearisome toil and frequent priva tions, their rough humor and improvident ways ?and he captured some of it in drawings as richly evocative as his writing. Particularly fine is A Ball in the Mines (fig. 5), a picture of wonderful vitality that enlivens his book. It portrays a dance Borthwick attended one evening at Angels Camp, where, as was usually the case, no women were present. "It was a strange sight," he wrote, "to see a party of long-bearded men, in heavy boots and flannel shirts, going through all the steps and figures of the dance with so much spirit, and often with a great deal of grace, hearty enjoyment depicted on their dried-up sunburned faces, and revolvers and bowie-knives glancing in their belts; while a crowd of the same rough-looking customers stood around, cheering them on to greater efforts, and occasionally dancing a step or two quietly on their own account."11 Though successful as a miner, Borthwick dis covered such an interest in the drawings he made during his leisure hours that he cut short his career as a gold hunter, convinced that he "could make paper and pencil much more profitable tools to work with than pick and shovel." The demand for pictures in California, as Borthwick makes clear, sprang in part from the Argonauts' sense of his tory, from their desire to possess some image?a mining scene, an urban view, a portrait?that would authenticate their participation in the Gold Rush. Ever on the move, the miners usually pre ferred drawings and watercolors to oil paintings, which were more expensive and not as easily tucked away or sent to loved ones back home. Symbols of youthful daring and enterprise, these pictures were usually preserved over the long years by the aging adventurers and their families.12 SPRING 1992 7</page><page sequence="7">^_^^____^B_______________9____________________________________M_^ ^^Ktt^^^^^Ssi^^l^^^^Ki^Bt^BS^^U^^^^^^^^^KBB^BSs^^S^^ Figure 5: J. D. Borthwick, A Ball in the Mines. Lithograph, from J. D. Borthwick, Three Years in California, 1857. Courtesy Bancroft Library. The first artist to take advantage of the Argo nauts' interest in pictorial images was John Prendergast, a native of England, who in 1848 sailed from Honolulu for the golden shore. At least as early as April of the following year he was making drawings of San Francisco, for which he charged twenty-five dollars. He soon had a rival in another British subject, William Redmond Ryan, who had earlier come west with the New York Volunteers. Arriving in San Francisco in the spring of 1849 after a dreary winter in Monterey, Ryan saw opportunity at hand and transformed his cor ner of the communal sleeping quarters at the Buckland House into a studio, one of his sea chests serving as an easel, the other as a seat. With no artists' supplies to be had anywhere in town, he hired a boat and rowed out into the harbor, pulling from ship to ship until he had acquired a few colors and several rough brushes. Ryan then hung a sign in front of his lodgings, and despite the difficulties under which he worked, he was soon earning an ounce of gold a day. This was "far better," he wrote, "than digging even two ounces in the mines, exposed to privations and the merciless inclem ency of the weather."13 Ryan, who subsequently took on a partner and practiced his profession with ever-increasing suc cess that summer, told much of the life of a frontier artist in his Personal Adventures in Upper and Lower California, in 1848-9 (1850). But, alas, he neglected to say anything about what he painted. Neverthe less, we may assume with some confidence that most of his work was portraiture. Earlier in his narrative, Ryan asserted that he had acquired "some proficiency" in this field "by years of study and practice."14 And of all the branches of art, none was initially more esteemed in California than the taking of likenesses. Indeed, so great was the demand for portraits in the early years that even an amateur artist could be wildly successful. Alonzo Delano, for example, later known for his humorous tales of the Gold Rush written under the pseudonym of "Old Block," put his slight skill as a draftsman to good use in the spring of 1850, when high water on the Feather River brought a temporary halt to his mining 8 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="8">operations. "For three weeks," he wrote of his career as an artist in Marysville, "I plied my pencil in copy ing the outre phiz and forms of the long bearded miners, at an ounce a head, when I found myself the wealthy recipient of four hundred dollars."15 Other "country artists" worked in California at this time, and if their art lacked sophistication, it nonetheless could be quite charming. Not all Californians, however, were as easily pleased as the miners. Some of the californios, rich with land and cattle, wanted stately portraits in oils, as did pioneer families who had prospered through com merce or ranching or investment. Newer men, like veterans of the Mexican War who had acquired distinction in law or public office, were also some times eager to possess imposing likenesses of themselves. Moreover, the state and local govern ments occasionally felt obliged to purchase solid portraits of Californians venerated as empire build ers. And, not surprisingly, as the Argonauts retired from mining and resumed their traditional trades and professions, they too wanted something finer than the rude productions of country artists or even the clever pencil sketches of able draftsmen like Borthwick. The demand for handsome, dignified likenesses stimulated the growth of painting in California and assured the success of skilled artists. Samuel S. Osgood, an established New York portraitist, arrived in San Francisco in early August 1849 and by the end of the month had orders for over $2,000 worth of paintings. He had come to California that spring, and on the road to Coloma found his path "literally strewn with flowers of all forms and hues; as far as the eye could see they stretched away, filling the air with delicious fragrance and charming the eye with their beauty and color." He and his companions wreathed handfuls of them about their hats as they continued on to the mines, where Osgood made his "pile" that golden sum mer. One of the fortunate few, he then spent five months in San Francisco painting portraits, for which he got "California prices."16 Osgood's favorite sitter was John A. Sutter, who had once ruled his vast land grant at the con fluence of the Sacramento and American rivers like a feudal baron. Although Sutter's fortunes were now in decline, he was still honored for his legendary hospitality to overland immigrants and his role in the gold discovery. Sutter first sat for Osgood while traveling to the state constitutional convention in Monterey, and this portrait (fig. 6), exhibiting the "ease and strength" contemporaries admired in the artist's work, shows him as a slen der, handsome man of middle years, elegantly attired in black broadcloth and gleaming linen, his mustache and imperial neatly trimmed, his gaze steady and assured?very much "the lion of Cali fornia," as Osgood called him.17 Other portrait painters established themselves in California during the age of gold, including such talented figures as Charles Nahl, Stephen Shaw, and Leonardo Barbieri, and such lesser lights as Thomas Officer, E. Hall Martin, and the crayon artist Charles Fenderich. But none of them enjoyed a warmer reception or met with more enduring success than William S. Jewett. An accomplished New York portraitist who had long maintained a studio on Washington Square, Jewett arrived in San Francisco in December 1849 and immediately fell in with many of his old friends from home. They insisted he take up his brushes at once, and since the mining company he had come out with had fallen apart and wet weather made travel to the mines difficult, he cheerfully assented.

Stevenson, late commander of the New York Volunteers, soon ordered his portrait, as did the prefect of the district and other prominent San Franciscans. "I am painting and I am as jolly among them as a clam at high water," Jewett wrote of his popularity. "I charge from hundred and fifty to eight hundred dollars?shall paint two or three per week if they come fast enough."18 Of the many paintings Jewett executed in his California career, none exerted as broad an appeal as his picture of the Grayson family. Andrew Jackson Grayson, while living in Missouri, had felt the pull of destiny in 1846, that "year of decision," and struck out for California with his wife and infant son. Years later he wrote with deep emotion of gazing on the broad valley of the Sacramento after a seemingly endless journey across plains and mountains. "A still happier change awaited us, when we at length passed uninterruptedly by the Indians through the silent woods of the Sierra Nevada and beheld for the first time, the promised land of our hopes?no words are adequate to express my feelings of delight, and most profound gratitude to my Maker, for thus leading us in His divine providence to so beautiful a land."19 In 1850, having grown wealthy through mining and speculation, Grayson commissioned Jewett to commemorate this moment of golden memory. Completed later that year, the painting, now called The Promised Land (color pi. 1), attracted much atten tion. Ferdinand C. Ewer, editor of the literary monthly The Pioneer, pointed out the inappropriate dress of Frances Grayson and her son, but never theless praised the work highly, asserting it was "truly and exclusively a Calif ornian picture." Later critics agreed, and some went further, one writer declaring it represented "the high idea of the prog ress of civilization westward." Benjamin P. Avery, a forty-niner who wrote one of the first histories of California art, was the most perceptive, observing that the painting portrayed a geography of hope as well as a geography of place. "This," he exclaimed, "is the Rasselas Valley of sober fact."20 For Avery, as for many other Californians, Jewett had caught the image of an old dream, the discovery of a Pacific Coast Canaan?a land blessed with a pleni tude of natural resources, a lyrical passage of the seasons, an enduring sweetness of life. The rapid rise of portraiture in gold-rush Califor nia was not for some years followed by a corre sponding interest in other branches of painting. As late as 1857, at the first fair held by the Mechan ics' Institute of San Francisco, professional artists responded to the aesthetic imperatives of this new society by predominantly contributing portraits to the fine arts display. Observing that the walls were hung with more paintings of local worthies than of local scenery, the art committee remarked in awarding a diploma to the amateur artist Mrs. A. T. Oakes for her landscapes in oil, "there are but few of this class of pictures on exhibition. The luxuries of painting can only follow the introduction of wealth-creating improvements, and it cannot be expected that at this epoch of the development of arts in California, the talents of artists in this class will be duly encouraged."21 Despite a lack of encouragement, artists did not entirely neglect the natural scene, even early in the age of gold. As in previous years, draftsmen attached to exploring parties produced pictorial records of the land, while other men, hoping to profit from the widespread interest in El Dorado, created huge moving panoramas that entertained as well as informed, enthralling audiences across America with scenes of wonder and curiosity.22 For the first time, moreover, artists began to compose landscape paintings entirely according to aesthetic impulses, seeking not to document or to amuse, but to create works of fine art. The beginning of landscape painting properly dates back to 1850, to The Promised Land, which is as much a portrait of the Sierra Nevada and the Sacramento Valley as of the Grayson family. Jewett, who had exhibited scenic views in New York as early as 1841, produced other landscapes in the years that followed, though only occasionally, relying on portraiture to support himself. But despite the general indifference of Californians to pictures of mountains and forests and streams, he had some competition in this field from other artist Argonauts, including Alburtus D. O. Browere and Thomas Ayres. Browere and Ayres had early come under the influence of the Hudson River School, as had Jewett, who was an associate member of the Na tional Academy of Design and an acquaintance of Thomas Cole, the school's first leader. Rather than revealing the bold beginnings of a new regional movement, the work of Browere and Ayres was, like Jewett's, a perpetuation of the prevailing tradi tion of American landscape painting. Browere, born 10 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="10">on the banks of the Hudson River, studied and worked in New York City, then moved upriver to the village of Catskill, where his neighbor was Cole himself. During two long sojourns in Califor nia, the first beginning in 1852, Browere produced a variety of landscape paintings, in addition to portraits and genre scenes. He preferred the colors of springtime, it would seem, when the vivid wildflowers and fresh grasses accorded best with the palette he had developed in upstate New York. He invariably drew on the conventions of the Hudson River School, and in style and iconogra phy his canvases all relate to the native movement (color pi. 3,4). Yet Browere was by no means insen sitive to the distinctive characteristics of this new land, and his finest work showed subtle effects of light and atmosphere.23 It is not known with any authority, as it is with Browere and Jewett, what circumstances of train ing and experience were responsible for Thomas Ayres's development as an artist. Yet there is no doubt that in his formative years he was swept up by the artistic currents of the Hudson River School, which flowed with such vigor just north of his native New Jersey. His appreciation of the wild erness, like that of other painters of the native movement, was animated by a pantheistic rever ence for the natural world. He could quote from William Cullen Bryant's Thanatopsis and upon seeing Illilouette Fall in Yosemite Valley wrote that the water came over the cliff "like a gust of living light from heaven."24 In giving pictorial form to the divine immanence of nature, in the East or in the West, Ayres relied on the old techniques of Cole and others. Thus in his High Sierra painting of 1858, Relief Valley (fig. 7), he used the characteristic Claudian composition early favored by the Hudson River men, separating the scene into three dis tinct planes?foreground, middle distance, and background. As was customary in this picturesque mode, where contrast and irregularity were empha sized, he showed the dark trees of the foreground rising up along the edges of the picture, thereby framing the view and concentrating attention on the principal subject of mountains and meadows.25 The first artist in California to earn a living entirely through the painting of landscapes was Frederick Butman.

He initially tried his hand at a variety of work, but by 1857, when he set out for California, he was known as a landscape painter. Once in San Francisco he established his reputation with several pictures of Yosemite Valley that were praised for their accurate drawing, rich coloring, and dramatic effects of light and atmosphere. Enterprising and energetic, Butman traveled widely through the state and up into Oregon and Washington Territory. In turning his field sketches into finished paintings, he made use of the early techniques of the Hudson River artists?though more subtly than Ayres?as may be seen in his Mount Shasta (fig. 8). Here a dark, rocky foreground contrasts with the golden tones of the upland plain and leads the eye toward the eternal snows of the grand peak itself. Although parts of the painting are conventional, derived from received imagery rather than fresh observation, it establishes the splendor of Pacific Coast scenery and dramatically describes the desolate beauty of the "King of the Mountains." Such pictures appealed strongly to Californians of Butman's day, "and from 1860 to 1865," according to Benjamin Avery, "gave him a greater share of popularity and success than was enjoyed by any other painter."26 Success came to Butman not only because of his skill and enterprise but because of the "rapid, mon strous maturity" of California since the first flush days of gold. In 1857, the date of his arrival, the state had a population of around 300,000, some 50,000 of whom resided in San Francisco. Many were Argonauts who had stayed on after the Gold Rush, but most, like Butman, were part of the great migration?from the East, from Europe, from Asia ?that continued on year after year. Though per haps a third of the population was engaged in mining, the economy had begun to expand, with commerce, agriculture, and industry all contribut ing to the wealth of California. Much of the profits of mine and mill, of factory and field, of stagecoach and steamship line flowed into San Francisco, which was not only the largest city on the Pacific Coast but the financial and cultural center of the Far West.27 Although in the late 1850s California was caught in an economic depression, better times were close at hand, and soon Nevada silver would inaugurate a new prosperous era. The Comstock Lode, discovered in 1859 in the wastes of western 12 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="12">Washoe, yielded four hundred million dollars in silver and gold over the following two decades, much of it enriching San Francisco, which by 1863 had a population of 115,000.28 Even as the state stood poised to enter the age of silver, it was evident that the conditions necessary to the rapid rise of art were emerg ing. "As we increase in wealth and stability," observed the Alta California in late 1859, "our citizens have more time to devote to matters of taste, and life becomes less and less a mere scramble for dollars, while what tends to public refinement, and the cultivation of the beautiful, is patronised with increased liberality." This patronage was, of course, dependent not only on wealth and stability, but on institutions that promoted art and made it a popular part of community life. While as yet there were no art associations nor academies nor even any real galleries in California, paintings and prints were often exhibited in shops devoted to framing, gilding, and the sale of artists' materials. In San Francisco, the firm of Jones, Wooll &amp; Sutherland had begun to carry pictures soon after its estab lishment in 1855, and by the early sixties it had several rivals, including Adrien Gensoul and Roos &amp; Wunderlich.29 Probably even more important in stimulating an interest in art were the huge exhibitions sponsored by the Mechanics' Institute of San Francisco. First held in 1857, these fairs were extremely popular with Californians, who could spend an entire day or more taking in the innumerable examples of mechanical, agricultural, and domestic industry on display. Initially, drawings and paintings were hung indiscriminately, but in 1864, at the fourth fair, a separate pavilion was devoted to the fine arts, with one of four large galleries reserved for California artists. An enormous attraction, this exhibit was "thronged night and day," recalled Avery, and it "led to the sale of many good pic tures, and elicited commissions for more."30 Among the artists who contributed to this fair were a few of the older pioneer painters such as Stephen Shaw and Charles Nahl. But the great success of the exhibit was in large part the work of newer men, who, besides prudently displaying their skill in portraiture, lined the walls with landscape, genre, and still-life paintings. In addition to Frederick Butman, this "second generation" of California artists included numerous painters who would become well known: Thomas Hill, who had begun his career decorating carriages in Massachu setts and who recently had shown promise as a landscape painter; Fortunato Arriola, a native of Mexico, tall and aristocratic, soon to be famous for his scenes of tropical splendor; and Gideon J. Denny, who having tried his hand at various ventures over the years, was now building a reputation as a marine artist. The oldest of the group, at forty-eight, was Samuel M. Brookes, British born, Denny's former teacher from Mil waukee, and, though newly arrived, already famed for his elegant still lifes. The youngest, at thirty three, was E. Wood Perry, a painter of portraits and genre scenes and one of the first artists attracted to the local color of the Chinese quarter. Having spent over two years with Leutze in Diisseldorf and a season with Couture in Paris, Perry was better trained than these other men. So also was his friend Virgil Williams, another New Englander, who had studied with Daniel Huntington in New York before continuing on to Rome, where he came under the influence of the American Titian, William Page. The most prominent of the group at the time, however, was Juan B. Wandesforde, a native of England and a student of John Varley, a member of the Century Association, a friend of N. P. Willis and Bayard Taylor, a founder of the New York Water Color Society.31 Isolated from other art centers by the plains and the Rockies, the artists of San Francisco were much stimulated by the 1863 visit of Perry and Williams's old friend from student days in Europe, Albert Bierstadt. Born in Prussia and reared in the seaport of New Bedford, Bierstadt was a solidly established New York artist, a National Academician, who having recently completed a true masterwork, The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), was on the eve of a meteoric rise to fame. Traveling overland by train and then stagecoach, he and his companion, the author and hasheesh-eater Fitz Hugh Ludlow, arrived in San Francisco in mid-July. After a "fort night's pleasaunce" at the Occidental Hotel, they started for Yosemite with a small party that included Williams and Perry. Coming upon their first view of the valley, the travelers were enthralled, seeing not so much "a new scene on the old familiar globe, as a new heaven and a new earth into which the creative spirit had just been breathed." During their six or seven weeks in the valley, the artists SPRING 1992 13</page><page sequence="13">made good use of the long summer days, rising at dawn and, after a breakfast of flapjacks and coffee, riding off with their stools and color boxes. Not until evening did they drift back to camp, where they examined one another's sketches, attended to supper, and then "brush-washing with talk and pipes led the rest of the genial way to bed-time."32 Out of this idyllic interlude came a number of paintings for both Perry and Williams, among which the latter's Along the Mariposa Trail (color pi. 7) is especially fine, capturing as no picture before this time the distinctive character, the light and color, of a California landscape. For Bierstadt, however, endlessly energetic and infinitely industrious, the time spent in Yosemite provided material for countless canvases?canvases that not only contributed to his growing reputation but authenticated for westerners and easterners alike the beauty and aesthetic significance of Cali fornia scenery. Some of Bierstadt's paintings were large and ambitious, great "exhibition works" that dramatically depicted the awesome grandeur of the valley. Chief among them was The Domes of the Yosemite (St. Johnsbury Athenaeum), a colossal canvas, nine-and-one-half by fifteen feet, portray ing the eastern end of the valley from near the base of the first wild leap of Yosemite Falls. Other works were much smaller, such as Mirror Lake, Yosemite Valley (fig. 9), in which the artist cap tured the ethereal charm of Tenaya Canyon, skill fully suggesting the peace and pleasures of an earthly paradise ringed 'round with soaring walls of granite. In the summer of 1871, eight years after this sojourn, Bierstadt returned to California. San Francisco had by then entered a new age, a socially and culturally exciting era created by such legendary enterprises as the building of the transcontinental railroad and the plundering of the Comstock Lode, which in the seventies yielded some three times the silver of the previous decade. With the passing of the sixties, the old enclaves of wealth, South Park and Rincon Hill, ceased to be fashionable, and the rich started their ascent of Nob Hill, the grand piles of the Big Four and various Silver Kings rising to dominate the skyline of the city. These wondrous wooden palaces, like the splendid country houses of Belmont and San Mateo, defined and gave tex ture to the age. In their size and cost and remarka ble flamboyance, they overshadowed the domestic architectural achievements of earlier years in much the same way that William Ralston's Palace Hotel eclipsed the old hostelries like the Lick House. While this was an era of corruption, excess, and monumental vulgarity, of terrible waste and mere tricious splendor, it was also an era of extraordinary personalities and astounding energy, of exuberance, vitality, and daring, of storied magnificence and stunning luxury. It was, moreover, an age in which Californians purchased art as never before or since. And though it was reported on Bierstadt's arrival that he planned to remain "for some weeks," more than two years would pass before his visit ended.33 Within a month of his return, Bierstadt was made an honorary member of the San Francisco Art Association, which had come into existence just that spring. The need for an organization that would increase public interest in painting had long been felt in San Francisco, and as early as 1864 artists and public spirited men had laid the foundations of the California Art Union.34 Though at first a success, with five hundred members, it had failed by year's end, and the San Francisco Artists' Union, which sprang to life in 1868 under the management of Samuel Brookes, was even shorter lived.35 But with the efflorescence of interest in art that followed the coming of the railroad, the times were right for the success of an organization that would contribute to a sense of artistic community, as well as promote the sale of paintings. A discussion held on March 21,1871, at a recep tion in the home of Juan B. Wandesforde, gave rise to the idea of the San Francisco Art Association, which was established the following week at a meeting of artists and "some of their literary friends." The society proved popular at once, and within two years over seven hundred Californians had joined, 75 of them subscribing $100 for life memberships.36 From the beginning the object of the founders was not only "the promotion of Painting, Sculpture and Fine Arts akin thereto," but "the establishment of an Academy or School of Design," and efforts were soon underway to acquire books, engravings, and other necessary supplies. In the fall of 1872, in recognition of the generous contributions made by San Franciscans to the wounded soldiers of the Franco-Prussian War, the government of France made promise of a large collection of plaster casts of antique sculp ture. In late December of the following year, little more than a month after the arrival of this valuable gift, a plan of organization was adopted, and on 14 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="14">i__^_a^?^___^3iiiSiMl___?______________B^ Figure 9: Albert Bierstadt, Mirror \jake, Yosemite Valley, 1864.

February 9, 1874, the School of Design opened its doors to a class of forty students. Under the direc tion of Virgil Williams, teacher and friend to count less young artists over the next decade, the school thrived, contributing to the growth of painting in San Francisco and the state.37 Much of the success of the San Francisco Art Association sprang from its series of receptions, which, like those of the National Academy of Design in New York, united the aspirations of art ists with those of society. Held at the association's rooms on Pine Street, the receptions gave artists the opportunity to promote sales and meet wealthy and cultivated CaUfornians in a congenial atmo sphere of refreshments and musical entertainment. The Overland Monthly, in the summer of 1872, credited much of "the very noticeable increase of the general interest taken in art matters" to these gatherings. "By bringing together persons of aes thetic taste at its social reunions," observed the magazine, the Art Association "has not only given an enlivening impulse to the esprit de corps of the professionals, but tended to make art popular by making it talked about and fashionable."38 The paintings exhibited at the summer and winter receptions could be seen by all the city's residents in the days following these convivial gatherings, when the doors of the association were opened to the public. The pictures that lined the walls stimulated an interest in painting among a SPRING 1992 15</page><page sequence="15">wide audience and on occasion were also a source of inspiration and even revelation to California artists. For among the canvases were works by prominent eastern painters, some on loan from private collections, others contributed by visiting artists. Pictures produced by painters on tour or sojourning in San Francisco were also displayed in the several art galleries that now stood along the elegant thoroughfares of the day In July 1871 Albert Bierstadt, for example, exhibited one of his large landscapes at the gallery of Snow &amp; Roos (the first in the city, established in 1869), and over the next two years he showed a variety of paintings at the Art Association. With their open compositions and expansive lighting, their vigorous celebration of American scenery, the best work of Bierstadt and other able easterners was an inspiration and a challenge to local painters, suggesting the artistic opportunities, the aesthetic possibilities, of the California landscape. Like Bierstadt, most of the artists who came streaming west in the 1870s?to see the natural wonders of the state, to seek the patronage of its millionaires?traveled by train. The joining of the rails at Promontory, Utah Territory, in May 1869 had at long last made a trip to California rela tively swift and comfortable, turning the thoughts of many Americans toward the Pacific Slope.

An excursion to California was certainly much more expensive than a trip to North Conway or Mount Desert, but across the continent lay some of the most superb scenery in the entire country. Here were grand and ancient forests, sparkling lakes of startling beauty, spec tacular snow-clad mountains, and over a thou sand miles of coastline, much of it rugged, wild, and picturesque. Among the many excursionists to take the train west soon after the driving of the last spike was R. Swain Gifford, a young New York artist who was gathering material to illustrate several chapters in Picturesque America (1872-74), that wonderful mon ument to the splendor of the American landscape. Swain was much taken with the coast, "a glorious place," he wrote a friend, "the sea always thun dering and breaking in long foamy lines"; and he explored it as far north as Mendocino County, traveling much of the distance on horseback and alone.39 The rugged Pacific littoral also aroused the enthusiasm of Martin Johnson Heade when he came west in 1875, inspiring him to paint one of his most famous landscapes, the long-lost Off the Coast of California, which was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Though a tireless traveler, Heade did not visit Yosemite, nor did Sanford Gifford, who the previous year had stopped over in San Francisco before pushing up the Sacramento River on a lengthy western excur sion. Such indifference to the principal natural wonder of California was unusual. For like other visitors, artists were usually eager to see the sights celebrated in the writings of Thomas Starr King, the photographs of Carleton Watkins, and the paintings of Albert Bierstadt. In 1870, even such a graybeard as Henry Pratt ?who more than forty years earlier had tramped the White Hills with Thomas Cole?was willing to endure the four days of dust and discomfort it took to travel from San Francisco to the valley. That same spring the first president of the American Society of Painters in Water Colors, Samuel Colman, made his way to Yosemite; and over the next several years, this famed mountain fastness was visited by numerous other artists, including Lemuel Wiles, the Smillie brothers George and James, Benjamin Champney, and the great Thomas Moran.40 Among the arrivals of 1874 was Herman Herzog of Phila delphia, who had first experienced the thrill of wilderness when as a student at the Diisseldorf Academy he made a sketching trip to Norway. Out of his California visit came a variety of fine paintings, among them Nevada Fall, Yosemite (fig. 10), which testifies to the artist's close observation of nature and great technical skill, especially in the treatment of moving water, as the Merced thun ders over the fall and rushes down the canyon. It suggests, as well, in the figure of the fisherman cheerfully striding along the river with his dog, something of the pleasure Herzog experienced in this splendid setting and of the glad welcome that awaited other visitors.41 Herzog, who traveled as far south as Los Angeles, spent several months in California, but others, like Bierstadt, stayed on longer, as sojourns shaded into residence. John R. Key, grandson of the author of "The Star Spangled Banner," arrived in Cali fornia during the summer of 1869 and took in the principal sights much like any artist on tour. But rather than return home to produce his paintings, he remained in San Francisco, holding an exhibi tion of his work in February and then, with the approach of summer, taking to the field again. Gilbert Munger, who arrived a couple of months after Key, also found much to hold him, and within the year he was said to be "doing more to bring to public notice the artistic resources in California scenery than any landscape painter whose pictures have been shown here." Like Key, Munger set out for home in late 1870, but unlike his old friend, who was unable to make good his intention to come west again, Munger did return, arriving in the summer of 1872. On this visit he traveled more extensively than before, and by late the next year he had completed enough large-scale studies to cover the walls of the San Francisco Art Association.42 As Californians were aware, there was a freshness to the work of these two artists that made so many earlier views seem weak and conventional by comparison. In part this vividness stemmed from Key's and Munger's close attention to nature, from their careful study of rocks and trees, as well as the more elusive elements of light and atmosphere.43 But there was also the matter of style. For though the open design and luminous vision of their pictures had been common to eastern art for a score of years, they represented sensibilities little SPRING 1992 17</page><page sequence="17">developed in the West, where the earlier customs and conventions of the native movement long remained ascendant. The acute perception and tightly controlled effects with which Key impressed Californians are evident in Lake Tahoe (fig. 11), a serene, sensitive view of high mountain splendor that looks northeast over still waters toward Mount Rose, the nearby treetops and distant shore flush with the light of early morning. Gilbert Munger was as concerned as Key with mood and atmosphere but, as a disciple of John Ruskin, even more so with careful delineation of detail. His Mount Tamal pais from San Rafael (fig. 1) is a startling realistic representation of coastal California, the scene sparkling with crystalline clarity in the drowsy warmth of late afternoon. Munger and Key, though rising talents, were overshadowed in importance by other painters who subsequently took up residence. Not only did Bierstadt soon return to win new acclaim, but in 1875 the celebrated artist of the silent Arctic wastes, William Bradford, arrived to a warm western welcome, as did James Hamilton, considered the "ablest marine painter" of his day.44 Internationally renowned, these three towering figures authen ticated San Francisco as an important center of American art. They were, however, only the most famous of the many artists who contributed to the splendid renaissance of painting that characterized the seventies. Some of the artists of this era were older residents, such as William Marple (color pi. 9), Juan B. Wandesforde, and Gideon J. Denny (color pi. 21), who had established their reputations earlier. Others were younger Califor nians, like Ransom Holdredge, Hiram Bloomer, Joseph Strong, and "the Adonis of the profession," Julian Rix (color pi. 18), who, brought west as infants or youths, turned to painting as they came to maturity.45 Many, though, were recent arrivals: Ferdinand Richardt, Danish born and educated, who had achieved wide notice for his paintings of Niagara Falls; James Walker, artist of California's pastoral age (color pi. 22); and the charming and carefree Bohemian Jules Tavernier, who established for a shining moment an artists' colony in the old Pacific capital of Monterey. Not a few were self taught, like Alexander Coulter, Meyer Straus, and Edwin Deakin, who would later win fame for his romantic paintings of the crumbling Franciscan missions. But others were well trained.

Yelland had spent four years in the schools of the National Academy of Design. Though nearly all the artists who surged into California took up residence in San Francisco and environs, a few were attracted elsewhere. In 1875 Henry Chapman Ford, a founder of the Chicago Academy of Design, settled in Santa Barbara, and the following year the restless wanderer Paul Petrovits set up his easel in the elegant Pico House on Main Street in Los Angeles. Despite the efforts of these and a handful of other painters, however, it was not until the following decade, in "the boom of the eighties," that the arts at last began to blossom in the soft, balmy air of southern California.46 There were also in these years several artists who returned to the state after long absences, preeminent among whom were William Keith and Thomas Hill, their landscapes expressing all that was strong and original in California art. Hill, who had first come west in 1861, was an ornamental artist who briefly practiced this craft before building a reputation as a portraitist and then a landscapist (color pi. 12, 13). In 1866 he went to Paris, study ing with Paul Meyerheim and achieving a remark able transformation of his style. A year later he was in Boston, where he sprang to prominence with his monumental Yosemite Valley. "It staggers Atlantic ideas of altitude and distance," wrote an awed critic on seeing the six-by-ten foot canvas "ripening under the final touches" of Hill's brush. "It is the whole of what Bierstadt gave us half, and a vision of the new world to be opened to us by the lengthening arms of the railway toward the Pacific."47 Reproduced as a chromolithograph by Prang &amp; Co., the painting later entered the collec tion of the railroad baron Charles Crocker. Now long lost, the picture resembled in vision and technique Hill's Great Canyon of the Sierras, Yosemite (color pi. 13), painted three years later and purchased by Charles's brother, E. B. Crocker, after the artist returned to California in the spring of 1872.48 This work typifies Hill's new style in its breadth and simplicity, its loose brushwork and strong impasto, which suggests a dynamic fusion of the painterly handling of Barbizon with the romantic vision of the native movement. Executed long after the artist had last seen the Yosemite, the painting lacks freshness, but nonetheless antici pates Hill's great panoramic canvases that so effectively captured the scale and sweep, the soaring rock, space, and light, of the Sierra Nevada. Vanished long ago with their age, save for the glorious Yosemite Valley in the Oakland Museum, Hill's works were as ambitious and expansive as the day itself, the ornaments of wealth and power, the pride of such patrons as Stanford, Ralston, and E. J. "Lucky" Baldwin. During the 1870s Hill was at the height of his career, recognized in the East as well as in the West as an important American artist. Each spring and summer he made lengthy sketching trips through the state, producing quick vigorous studies in color, which even at the time were recognized as pictures such "as any collector would covet, without another touch."49 Unlike so many artists, Hill maintained much of this freshness in his finished paintings, as can be seen in California (fig. 12), a spacious, sunny view of the old Rancho San Mateo of W. D. M. Howard, located where the towns of Burlingame and Hillsborough now stand. In the foreground a herd of cattle ambles past a reed-bordered pool and into the shade of spreading sycamores, while in the distance, in the soft, hazy light of afternoon, rise the rolling hills of the Coast Range. Possessed of a simple naturalism, with none of the conven tional imagery of his earlier work, the painting testifies to the artist's imaginative response to the land, to his commitment to an authentic expression of all that was truly Californian. In June 1872, shortly after Hill returned, William Keith also came back to California.50 Born in Scotland and apprenticed to a wood engraver in New York at the age of seventeen, Keith had taken passage to California in 1859 and long prac ticed his craft in San Francisco. Though secure as an engraver, he possessed ambition and as early as 1863 took lessons in oil painting from Samuel Brookes. Achievement came but slowly, and with the joining of the rails to the East he set out for study in Europe. The strength of his mature style ?first evident when he exhibited in New York in 1871?was apparent to Californians soon after his return. In September Keith completed a large paint ing of Mount Tamalpais that was at once recog nized as an original and authentic expression of central coast scenery, and he was hailed for having "struck the key in art which Bret Harte struck in literature, when the latter devoted his nice talent to unique local themes."51 SPRING 1992 19</page><page sequence="19">Figure 12: Thomas Hill, California, 1879. Oil on canvas, 42 x 701/. in. Courtesy Paul and Alice Elcano. A prolific artist, Keith produced countless can vases in this era, revealing with bold strokes the wild beauty of California, from the snow-clad summits of the High Sierra to the sparkling shores of the Pacific Coast. Representative of the work that brought him early attention is Haying in Marin County (color pi. 19), a fresh, evocative image of a characteristic coastal landscape, the sea fog billowing up the distant valley toward the sun drenched field in the foreground, with its neat hayricks and bordering grove of redwood, oak, and brilliant cinnamon-barked madrone. In addition to pictures such as this, Keith, like Hill, produced a series of monumental paintings of the Sierra Nevada. These enormous canvases, often six by ten feet, combined art and science with intimations of spiritual revelation. Widely popular with the general public, they also received the authoritative praise of Keith's friend John Muir. "The painted rocks are so truly rocky," exclaimed the naturalist of one painting, "we would expect to hear them clank and ring to the blows of a hammer; and notwithstanding they are so full of plain truth in form, sculpture, and combination, as to be fit for scientific illustration, the whole picture glows with the very genius and poetry of the Sierra."52 Among those works still extant is Upper Kern River (fig. 13), a stunning view of towering snow-laden peaks and glacier scoured granite walls, of wind-swept pines and swift-flowing, singing waters. It shows Keith, like Hill, to have been a master at conveying vast distances and space, and tells of the artist's deep love of this magnificent mountain range. Although this decade was distinguished princi pally for the achievements of its landscape painters, it was also a time when history and genre painting finally flowered, signalling the new maturity of California art and culture. Charles Nahl, who arrived in 1851, had shown unusual skill as a history painter while still a youth in his native Hesse. In California he early executed a few works in this vein and through the 1860s occasionally produced 20 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="20">other pieces. But it was not until Judge E. B. Crocker retired as chief legal counsel of the Central Pacific and became his great patron that Nahl was able to commemorate times gone by in the grand manner. Among his most famous works was Sunday Morning in the Mines (color pi. 14), in which the artist gave form and feeling to the varied character of the men who twenty years before had responded to the call of gold. On a huge canvas he showed the miners at their leisure, as they occupied themselves in such reflective pastimes as letter writing and Bible study or joined in the wild abandon of that youthful moment, brawling, carousing, racing horseback through the dusty camp. Although Nahl's style was rather old-fashioned by this date, he produced a painting that in its size and sweep, its vitality and vivid imagery, authenticated the Gold Rush as an epic experience in American history. Completed in 1872, it was exhibited the following year in the window of a gallery in San Francisco, where it "created a great sensation, the admiring crowd blocking up the sidewalk in the evening."53 y^^ v_______lw_#^i w^' ^xWE_-B-__i^-_SB_kl^^T - v *?? * -" . - _______________________________________________E________fl-_i_K - '^^^l^^^iii_^_____^_______^________B^-__^_H __________________________________________________B -1r^^^ _________________!____________________________________________________________________ ' -^^?- ^^^^.^^l__________s^^H^^______-^__^_________________________! ^^^^^H__H^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^HHByi^_w9BM5^^^^J^- * ^^. ^^^^~-^-^^NP^_____^ |H^^^H^|^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^HB^^^i^^,-,m^^^4.&gt;",; * -s^^!_p- ^pI^99Hh_b_^^^I^H_^H^_I^^^HI^^^I _____HB__h_9___________________________________________HHI______ &gt;-^! i^^:^.,^S_j_?^MPi??w&gt;^BjB|Bl____!l_____B_______________ |_^_|^HHH^^^^|^lH^_^^^____^HI^^^|H9_S__^^^|^^^^^^^^^IHH Figure 13: William Keith, Upper Kern River, 1876.

SPRING 1992 21</page><page sequence="21">Other artists of this era also produced his tory paintings, among them Jules Tavernier, Andrew Hill, Joseph Harrington, and the old Roman, Domenico Tojetti, a student of Camuccini, a recipient of papal commissions. Genre painting, however, was much more widely prac ticed, and such artists as Joseph Strong, William Marple, Elizabeth Rockwell, Virgil Williams, and Thomas Hill, to name but a handful, all executed pictures of everyday life. Some of the work of this time portrayed commonplace activity in a broad, universal way, but much of it focused on regional patterns of experience. Among the most able of those who made use of local themes was Ernest Narjot, a native of France who had joined in the mad rush to California when the cry of gold was raised. Later he took part in a filibustering expedition to Mexico, where he spent over a dec ade mining and painting before returning north.54 Particularly appealing is his Glen Ellen of 1878 (fig. 14), a handsome, luminous work that evokes the simple, innocent pleasures of nineteenth-century rural California. Equally accomplished as a figure painter was William Hahn, who more than any artist of the time captured the varied texture of everyday life in California.

Upon settling in, he immediately established his reputation with Mar ket Scene, Sansome Street, San Francisco (color pi. 16) and over the next decade produced a wonderful range of genre scenes.55 Among his finest is Yosemite Valley from Glacier Point (color pi. 17), which sug gests that California as a regional civilization was coming of age. A superb painting?crisply drawn, naturally and suggestively handled?it shows a tourist party looking out over a breathtaking geolog ical wonderland of sculptured granite that stretches to a range of icy peaks strung along the distant horizon. A quarter of a century earlier, when William Jewett had painted his portrait of the Grayson family (color pi. 1), he showed them gaz ing at the promised land of the Sacramento Valley, the dark Sierra?the last of many hardships sur mounted in their overland journey?behind them. But with pioneer days long in the past, the moun tains of California were solidly established in pop ular imagery not as a barrier, but as a destination and a resort, a source of refreshment, beauty, inspi ration, and joy. Between the 1840s and the 1870s, the fine arts had experienced a remarkable growth in the Golden State. Writing in 1874 for an eastern audience, Benjamin Avery pointed out that "New York was nearly two centuries old before she had an acad emy of fine art," and Boston much older still before a school of design was established. "Yet San Fran cisco, which twenty-five years ago was a hamlet of three hundred inhabitants, can already boast that it has done more for art culture than either of the two older cities had done within the early mem ory of men whose heads are not yet gray."56 In the summer of 1849, the pioneer painter William Red mond Ryan had opened the city's first true studio in a large canvas tent, which the afternoon winds shook violently and filled with swirling clouds of dust. But by 1874, when William Hahn painted his well-dressed tourist party at Yosemite, dozens of studios were situated along the busy avenues of San Francisco, particularly Montgomery Street, the most important thoroughfare in the city. More over, a half-dozen galleries now stood downtown, where high fashion and high finance mingled on any sunny afternoon. Evidence of strong local sup port for painting was also apparent in the prolifer ation of auctions, the growth of important private collections, the wide popular success of the San Francisco Art Association, and the establishment of the first art academy west of the Mississippi, in this most lively of American art centers.

Anthony Kirk completed his doctorate in history, with a spe cialization in American cultural history and art history, from the University of California, Santa Barbara. He recently com pleted a book-length manuscript entitled "Visions of a Golden Land: California Art and Artists from the Age of Exploration to the Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906." Currently, Dr. Kirk works as a free-lance historian and as a consultant in educational testing. SPRING 1992 23</page></plain_text>
