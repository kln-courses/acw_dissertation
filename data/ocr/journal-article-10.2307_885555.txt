<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARI KALMAN MELLER Exercises in and around Degas's classrooms: Part III THIS article, the third and last of a series,* takes up some formal and affective themes in Degas's work which emerge particularly in the ballet classrooms: they include some of the artist's characteristic ways of heightening picture and picture-space, and his obsessive manipulations of the female figure, which will be discussed in relation to his recurrent imagery of defeat and demoralisation. The shapes of espaliered trees' A repeated motif in Degas's work is the dancer seated on a chair or bench, the dancer who is not dancing. These figures, often in pairs or sequences, evoke states ranging from idle repose through simple fatigue to inanimate, despairing exhaustion. In the leftward frieze-format class- rooms, as we saw in Part II, dancers at rest are contrasted with dancers exercising at the barre - inaction and passivity in the foreground, activity, striving and professional disci- pline in the background.2 In a rich series of late pastels, the first term of that contrast is isolated as the picture's exclusive theme. Degas had created the prototype of the seated dancers subject in the fertile years of the late 1870s. Two back-to- back dancers in a single 'crab-like' outline appear in fully- developed and classic form in a pastel of c.1879, Two dancers sitting on a bench, now in Shelburne, Vermont (Fig. 1). If we set that work beside the Two dancers at the barre (Metropolitan Museum) of three years earlier (Fig.2), the two images offer a fruitful complementarity. The high viewpoint in both works flattens the background, setting up an unaccustomed, emphatic framing of the figures. The pictorial spaces are contrasted: the barre creates a steep, rushing oblique along which the two figures follow one another into pictorial depth, whereas the bench is seen enface, in a space static and frontal. Yet the dancers at the barre are brought back to an equalising, simultaneous presence by the finely adjusted calligraphic parallelism of their barely-separated silhouettes. The barre and bench supply clear-cut reference lines. But at the upward-sloping barre the four legs are centrifugal, making angles that expand outwards towards infinity, whereas the limbs de- scending from the horizontal bench chop up the space into sharp, alternating trapezoids. The Shelburne pastel exploits the rhyming and con- trasting possibilities offered by two linked torsos, four legs and four arms - a primordial generative form, for replication begins (genetically, graphically, and in myth) by division and doubling.3 The composition of the seated figures is based throughout on division by two. No one version of the sitting dancer's image could so richly feed and occupy the visual appetite: in their defenceless repetition and rotation the two are explicit references for one another, proposing to the eye the luxurious task of comparison. Hence the shifting, alternating focus of the ellipse swept out by the paired circular skirts. These hybrid creatures, graphic and stripped of animation like cartoon figures caught in a single frame, are at the same time sculptural; they mark out a shallow zone of depth against the flattening background. This is an art of laps and concavities, of gaps and intervals that wind through and around the figures in a compelling, rhythmic, undulating game of hide-and- seek.4 Its unfailing cadence is given by the few positive props and the grid of limbs, by the rhyming correspondences of their abstracted, near-geometric shapes. These two images illustrate Degas's fondness for placing figures turned aside from each other - either back-to-back or in variations which by their internal dynamic call up opposing spaces within and beyond the picture-frame.5 But just as frequently he sets his paired figures face-to-face. As we shall see, the Blue dancers of the Musee d'Orsay, for example, re-uses twenty years later the two figures of the Shelburne pastel. When back-to-back and face-to-face relationships are conjoined - as in the Three women combing their hair of c. 1875 (L.375), in Vicomte Lepic and his daughters in the Place de la Concorde (L.368), in the acutely stylised dancers in the Classroom with double-bass (L.905), and in many racing scenes6 - the crisp sequence of rotations, right-left left-right, both vivifies the surface and extends the duration.' The Shelburne pastel's formal relationships and those of its counterpart Two dancers at the barre - self- contained, avoiding both cropping and overlap - are dis- tinctive but by no means isolated;8 they are typically diagrammatic and ornamental. Figural sequences generated by repetition and rotation re-emerge in several phases throughout his metrical, prosodic work.9 The bench and barre patterns migrate from classroom to classroom, es- *Part I of this study appeared in this Magazine, CXXX [March 1988], pp. 198- 215, Part II in CXXXII [April 1990], pp.253-65 (henceforth cited as Parts I and II respectively).

PARRY JANIs: 'Degas and the Master of Chiaroscuro', Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago, VII [1972], p.67: 'Composition by suggestive juxtaposition of figures is one of Degas's greatest and most characteristic strengths in all media'. 6In the prototypical Jockeys in the rain in Glasgow of around 1880, L.603, this effect is restricted to a group of three out of five figures. The pattern of this work is analogous to L.755,756 and 757, and close to several other racing scenes where, more strikingly, the crisp effect of successive oppositions occupies the foreground. 7Degas also adopts this vivifying manner in the choice of posture of a single figure. See, for example, his sculpture RLXI (J. REWALD: Degas: Works in sculpture - A complete catalog, New York [1944]), the pose of which is present also in the repoussoir dancer-figure in L.589, 588. 8E.g., among many others, Before the dance L.531 and 530, Waiting, L.698, Dancers at rest, L.661.

The fullest deployment of this compositional approach is perhaps in the Cleveland frieze of seated dancers, discussed below; but the compelling metrical character of that work can be found in many other compositions.

The exemplary shapes into which Degas trains his figures bring a bold ornamental quality, both spatial and temporal, to works dedicated to ephemeral themes. This intensively cultivated repertoire of forms can also become a means of propagating and transmitting metaphor. Back-to-back,face-to-face; interlude at the races. Degas's exhaustive exploitation of the back-to-back motif is well illustrated by the racing scene, Behind the starting- barrier of c. 1880 (Fig.3). The centre of this frieze-like composition is dominated by the large motif of two horses with their riders, their hindquarters overlapping slightly which, in its calligraphic symmetry, could be the design for a piece of ornamental art." The care with which Degas has adjusted the negative forms between the riders' backs and the horses' legs, bringing them teasingly close to literal symmetry, is in just the same spirit as his treatment of the dancers in the Shelburne pastel. These twinned centaurs mark the phase-change between the crowded right foreground and the open background on the left. The development of the central motif-- densely echoed on the right, rarefied on the left - is a direct response to the special character of the frieze-format.'2 The central pair is set off by subtle melodic scherzo devices: the next horse to the right is again a reflection, nose-to-nose, and shares in the bold decorative treatment of the central pair. On the far left, the receding sequence of figures takes a surprising Kandinskian turn as the farthest rider of all, in his full white shirt, suddenly disappears down a steep grassy slope. The starting-barrier itself has the familiar reference-function of the long wall-panels and barres in-the classroom scenes,13 structuring the picture-space and fixing the spatial pos- itions of his figures: 'nothing should seem accidental in the picture, not even movement'.14 Calculated effects of move- ment can be studied in the Birmingham Jockeys before the race (Fig.4; L.649). Here the barrier, now upright, dra- pecially in the friezes; we recall once more not only the crab-like seated pairs, but from the Widener frieze the four-figured sequence strung along the barre in a nearly even line, a perpetuum mobile whose abstract device we 'oSee Part II, p.265, note 74.

"3The racing scenes allow Degas to place this Mantegnesque reference bar in front of the figures: cf. Mantegna's Martyrdom of St James (destroyed 1944), Cappella Ovetari, Chiesa degli Eremitani, Padua. Even closer to that precedent is Before the race, of c. 1885, L.889, where the barrier is drawn horizontally across the foreground. A barrier has also been revealed during X-ray examination in Race with amateur riders (L.461); see c.

LEMOISNE: Degas et son auvre, Paris [1946], p. 117. The echo of Mantegna in the frieze Behind the barrier takes us back to the ballet frieze of Dancers ascending a staircase of c. 1888, discussed in Part II, p.263, fig. 33.

'Each work should be a new creation of the mind' In 1880, the Dance examination of c. 1879 now in Denver (Fig.5) was exhibited alongside the Shelburne pastel; in its restrictive characterisation of the figures it may cast some light on the latter. The two pastels are analogous in the peculiar way that the whole composition is supported on the silhouetted legs: this device, a part of Degas's indexical language of structural limbs and limb-substitutes, can be traced back to the early versions of the Young Spartans and beyond.15 The Dance examination compresses into a vertical format three generations of the Parisian concierge-type, quite in the spirit of the social physiognomies of Daumier or Balzac.16 At the back a senior aunt perhaps, then the mother or tutelary elder sister, and then the two young gutter-nymphs in tutus, who may with luck find their way from the Opera to a more prosperous social sphere. The Shelburne Dancers on a bench are colleagues of these new recruits. All four, in ungainly chrysalis state, signal what they may become: bodies reworked into alluring symbols, bearers of the mutual illusion that art makes permeable the boundaries of class. Conservative critics found Degas's realism gratuitous and shocking: 'It is not the mission of art to say everything, as if giving legal evidence in court', wrote a reviewer.17 This curious comment suggests that the ruthless social testimony of the Dance examination and the Shelburne Dancers had already touched the same nerve as had the trials of adolescent criminals that shook France at the end of the 1870s.18 In the Exposition of the following year Degas made the as- sociation explicit: his Physiognomies from the 1880 trial pull the Little dancer of fourteen years, by association, into a borderland with the young criminals of the Parisian streets. Yet in her provocative three-dimensionality, even though she is modelled after the same Marie van Goethem who sits at Melina Darde's right in the Shelburne pastel, the Little dancer breathes with a life of her own.19 'Each work should be a new creation of the mind', as Mallarme wrote. quoting Manet.20 The art of the two ballet subjects exhibited in 1880 is different, even if their subjects are socially akin. The de- 5 Dance examination, by Edgar Degas. c. 1879. Pastel, 63.4 by 48.2 cm. (Denver Art Museum). scriptive Dance examination fits the category of realistic genre painting, but the Shelburne pastel is far from being an anecdotal glimpse into the daily life of the classroom.21 The Shelburne dancers, turning away from each other, sunk in a shared faceless exhaustion, re-embody the haunting motif of the two cowering, victimised women back-to-back at the tree in the Medieval war scene (Fig.6). The explicit sensationalism of that peinture d'histoire, its ropes and weapons, has disappeared; the pathos is now all conveyed by the idiosyncratic relationships binding the forms.22 What is retained from the original pair is not the literal outline but the calligraphic symmetry of the unit of two '5Degas's inveterate use of animate and inanimate linear elements as both structural suppoirt and form-relating grid can be found as early as 1856 - see for example St John the Evangelist and angel blowing a trumpet, L.20 and its studies. The development from the staff and trumpet here to Vicomte Lepic's umbrella and cigar, or to the umbrella that supports Mary Cassatt at the Louvre, is at one with the development from the Young Spartans to later works, aspects of which were discussed in Part I, pp.214-15 (see also Part II, p.264, note 72). It is worth noting the hitherto unremarked fact that one of the Spartan boys holds a stick behind his back, seen even more clearly in the three studies, L.71, 72, 73 and in others. '6The overlap between the recruits to the Opera ballet and the daughters of the concierge class was a commonplace: LUDOVIC HALEVY's Histoire de la Famille Cardinal, Paris [1883], for which Degas made monotypes, is an illuminating source.

Huysmans's praise of this work and of Degas's part in the exhibition, less appreciated by other critics (cf.

Her repugnant attraction is like that of Picasso's Demoiselles of 1906; both go beyond the human range that their audience expected to find in art. Her embellishments of horsehair and tulle enhance this effect, like the primitivism of the masks in the Demoiselles. 20sTEPHANE MALLARME: 'The Impressionists and E.

Through such small modifi- cations the character of the Shelburne pastel was arrived at; without them it would have much more the character of a genre-piece, a pendant to the Dance examination. 22The links between the victims in the Medieval war scene and Degas's later nudes have been extensively recognised, starting with G. BAZIN: 'Degas, sculpteur', L'Amour de l'art [ 1931]; the recognition that the same victim-figures are also re- embodied in Degas's 'painting of modern life', as here in the Shelburne pastel, enlarges their sphere of influence and helps to understand the affective resonance of the weary dancers. 455</page><page sequence="5">DEGAS'S CLASSROOMS 6. Medieval war scene, by Edgar Degas. 1865. Essence on paper, 81 by 147 cm. (Musee d'Orsay, Paris). bodies, and their expressive downward pose, one of Degas's unmistakeable trademarks. The dancers on the bench, though they are surely drawn from realistic descriptive studies, are mortified above all by the compositional physiog- nomy of the picture itself, as starkly formulated as a court judgment. They are presented not narratively but hier- atically, almost like a Pietat or Man of Sorrows; but the plain bench, high on the picture surface and flatly lit, is a place of accusation and punishment rather than of pity. It is possible to read this work in terms of realism- the exhaustion of the exploited young worker, the misery of the aspiring femme fatale. But the manipulations to which Degas has subjected the motif have carried the work far away from genre. In the interplay of life-and-death extremes that vibrates throughout Degas's work, early and late, the primary theme is defeat. It emerges most explicitly in the recurrence of motifs such as the Jockey blesse (Fig.7),23 but it lurks also in whole series of other works, some of which will be discussed below. It is surely not accidental that the composition of the fallen rider, in its generally known form, was conceived at much the same time as the War scene, the compositional plan of which is also seminal. In fact, the Medieval war scene and Scene of steeplechasing (L. 140) were shown in the successive 1865 and 1866 Salons. The fundamental theme of both, that of the victim, contains divers connexions between them. Classrooms of the nineties; pattern as rhetoric. In the classroom scenes of the 1890s - often divided by a central pillar, and still occasionally in frieze format- new formulae emerge both for the inactive group in the foreground and for its counterpart in the deeper space of the room. In the study of nudes of c.1898 for the Dance foyer (Fig.8),24 the line of dancers exercising at the barre is replaced by two figures turned inwards in a duel of near- arabesque poses.25 In the foreground, Degas abandons the back-to-back placement of the dancers on the bench, and all three figures turn towards the right. We know the foreground figures quite well from earlier compositions and studies; but the two at opposite ends of the bench have taken on an unprecedented and expressive mannerist twist.26 The one on the left, leaning on her raised knee in a plangent contrapposto, now more than ever has the 7.

THIEBAULT-SISSON: 'Degas sculpteur racont6 par lui-meme', Le Temps [23rd May 1921], quoted in Degas,form and space, exh.cat., Centre Culturel du Marais, Paris [1984], p. 172. 24L. 1202.

If that is the case, the added strips in L. 1202 were removed again in the reworking. See also the versions L. 1200, 1201, 1394, and Vente Degas, Paris [1918-19], 11.285. 25 The composition of this background duel can be associated with the dislocation of the figures in the background of the Burrell classroom, discussed in Part I, and their later developments (cf. among others L.653, L.1131, and Vente Degas, Paris [1918-19], III 196). 26See Part II, Figs.25, 32, 34. 456</page><page sequence="6">DEGAS'S CLASSROOMS 8.

'Les coudes sont croisis' reads a note on a related study of c. 1880 now in Belgrade, a later remodelling of the elegiac motif. Note the different positions of the arms in a study also in the Belgrade Museum, in the Metropolitan charcoal and the Yale frieze (Part II, Figs.30-32), and in the Dance foyer. Degas's bathers at this period have comparably twisted poses; see e.g. L. 1309. 28For example: the middle dancer is a grief-stricken descendant of the dreamy Dancer at rest of c.1880 (see Part II, fig.27). This image can be linked to the studies in the Vente Degas (Paris [1918-19]), III, 260, 264, and IV 154. It recalls the exhausted gesture of the study of c.1882-85 (L.910; see Part II, fig.19), perhaps also RF 122 65. The study closest in time is Vente Degas III, 274, but it also points towards other works. The dancer on the far right is a cross-bred product of the original Darde pose of the late 1870s with the pose of the dancer in this corner in earlier leftward friezes. 29See the Practising room, L.362, and the charcoal study, Vente Degas III, 238, which addresses the relationship of the pillar, the figure holding it, and the twisted figure on the bench. See also Vente Degas II, 268. For the lurking survival of the Practising room in the friezes, see Part II, note 34. L.924 and L. 1013 are also derivatives of the Practising room. 30A formidable charcoal drawing, inscribed to Mme Charpentier (sold at Christie's, London, 4th April 1989), is very close to the figure at the far right. 457</page><page sequence="7">DEGAS'S CLASSROOMS between the whole and its parts, as if all the figures had unfolded out of the same shell. The pastel of Four dancers in the foyer (Fig.9),31 cor- responds in composition to the foregrounds of the classrooms usually assigned to the second half of the 1890s, and could well be read as an offshoot of those. However, it was sold to Durand-Ruel on New Year's Day 1891, and was probably executed the previous year. 32 That date, and the connexions with the 1882-85 carnet-sketches,33 suggests that this self- contained composition was developed as an alternative solution for the foreground of the Yale frieze (which had also been in Degas's mind since the early eighties and was finished between 1885 and 1890).34 Degas's insatiable pursuit of new articulations of space, most obsessive in the friezes, is not merely a question of removing pawns from the board. In the metrical clarity of the Dance foyer, we are confronted with a completely re- invented path between classic ornamentality and the unclothed 'pure relations' that would be achieved by Mondrian.35 If we compare the Four dancers in the foyer with the version in the Vollard album, it is as if the same poetic phrase were repeated with altered words. The lethargic, twisted and haggard elements replace broader forms such as the dancer tying her slipper seen earlier in the Rehearsals on stage of c. 1874 and repeated in the late Cleveland frieze. The late Dancers at rest pastels represent a substantial branch of Degas's work in the 1890s.36 This series, most often restricted to two figures, was developed both from the sequences of three and four just discussed, and as an evident reprise of the Shelburne pastel.37 These dancers, seen from a lowered viewpoint, are not Degas's habitual canaille types; they include the most delicate and sym- pathetic faces to be found among his dancers.38 The un- ending operations in these pastels might seem obsessively formalistic, were it not for their singular, melancholy lyricism: Degas is cultivating his garden of anthropomorphic geometry with particular tenderness. While most of the preparatory nude studies in charcoal are vehement assertions of grief,39 the pastel versions dressed in coloured tulle are transposed into a quite different mode, of suspended reality. A masterpiece among the pastels in this series is the Blue dancers in the Musee d'Orsay (Fig. 10). The laps of the two figures, corresponding yet centrifugal, enclose a space of haunting plasticity. There is no point at which the two figures touch, and only a very slight but central overlapping of the feet on the bench.40 The generative power of the replicated figure is perfectly exemplified in this very late work. The beholder is lost in not one but two bottomless pools of powdery blue gauze. Through these images we approach Degas's double-faced sense of life itself, and its compenetration with death. Always present in his work, it emerges in another, sardonic key in a rondeau made in 1890, where 'la noce' and 'la mort' are interchangeable.41 Review and intermezzo: in and around the ballet pictures Over the decades we can follow Degas's movement away from the amused, amusing observer of everyday Paris toward the acute, ethnographically credible realist, who also drew on archaic depths, the tormented and tormenting elegiac poet. There are, however, certain con- stants that persist throughout his work. In the many-armed Dancers on stage, a pastel of 1883 (Fig. 12), the big, strongly outlined hand of a cut-off dancer at lower right energetically pushes back a series of other hands. The first face in the picture- the only one shown in its entirety, with the ginger-coloured frou-frou, is also very specific, indeed almost recognisable - we might almost have seen her yesterday changing trains at the Miromesnil metro. A diagonal latticework of arms cuts up the surface, leaving one rectangular cell completely empty at top centre. Not blood, but stage light circulates in the limbs, their texture is a luminous kinetic embroidery in 'frozen move- ment'. The picture struck Fdlix Feneon as 'l'image d'un dieu indou ipileptique'.42 From near to far, from the hyper-real hand in the right foreground to the disintegrating, vanishing arms in the upper left, Degas has contrived an idiosyncratic synthesis ad infinitum. Vibrating in the yellow powdery light, concrete and unreal, the Dancers on stage is a chal- lenging, esoteric, somehow malign joke, a reprise for the danse macabre. To superimpose an artificial pattern on any maleria prima, as in the Dancers on stage and other rarefied ballet and racing scenes,43 was Degas's normal practice, but its mood is oceanic and changeant. The subject is represented, alternately and together, as purposeful and doomed to futility, vital or listless or suffering; and these oscillations interact with the behaviour of the painted space, itself changeant between solid and void, flatness and depth, near and far, movement and stillness, fragment and whole. Degas's orbit is elliptical, constantly falling towards and 3 LS. 148, where however it is dated 1897-98.

REFF: The Notebooks of Edgar Degas, 2nd ed., 2 vols., New York [1985] I, p.144, and II, Notebook 36, the splendid pp.2, 3.

The bent nude of p.3, sketchier than II: 122.2, is an untwisted, earlier version of the Charpentier study mentioned at note 31 above. 34The Four dancers perfects a specific figural sequence related to the friezes. Another alternative, the Widener frieze (L.941; sold to Durand-Ruel in 1892) has already been discussed as Degas's first response to the shortcomings of the Yale frieze. 35On Mondrian and Degas see Part II, p.265, note 74, and M. SCHAPIRO: Modern Art, London [1978], p.235. 36Reff counts more than twenty works on this theme after 1888, continuing in some cases beyond 1900. See T. REFF: 'The Degas of Detroit', Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Art, 53 [1974], p.42, and BOGGs, in Cat. 1988, pp.590-94, where L. 1465 is dated as late as c. 1910. 37 See the almost exact repetition of the Shelburne figural pattern in the charcoal study, L. 1255. 38Cf. e.g. L. 1243 and variants, L. 1323, L. 1325, L. 1331 bis. 39For a sensitive account of the charcoal studies, see REFF, loc.cit. at note 36 above. 40Degas's dancers, in fact, very rarely touch one another. Among the few exceptions is the Foyer de danse, of c. 1879, in Glasgow (L.700), which painfully mixes dancers with their relatives. 41Quoted by C.W. MILLARD: The Sculpture of Edgar Degas, Princeton [1976], p.88. Degas sent the rondeau to Bartholom6 with the comment; 'What a subject! Inexhaustible'. 42'Calendrier de Janvier', La Revue Indipendante [February 1888]; quoted by G. TINTEROW in Cat. 1988, p.430. 43The fragmented scene of the Dancers on stage is a scale complete in itself. The Jockeys in the rain, like other racing scenes of different dates (e.g. L.755, 856, 859, 756) divides the surface between reciprocal values of the blocks of figures and landscape. The sequence of horses in these pictures is constructed like the sequence of dancers in the Classroom with double bass (L.905; see Part I, p.255, fig.21), with its rotated figures and acute diagonal. 458</page><page sequence="8">DEGAS'S CLASSROOMS 10.

It is this mode of lived experience, singular, heart-wrenching amplitude, that has so often evoked the metaphor of theperpetuum mobile. Perhaps its most engaging aspect is Degas's vision of endless alternative possibilities, operative, imaginative, technical. Millard calls Degas, in this respect, 'a pioneer alongside Cezanne ... andJoyce'.44 Perfectionism and thirst for experiment are, as Reff has noted, self-defeating traits in Degas as in Leonardo.45 Degas's visual world of illusions mockingly subverts any notion of univocal truth. In a notebook of 1869, we read 'Ily a chance de rencontrer autant de ressemblance entre une figure et un caillou qu'entre deux cailloux. . .'.46 The carnet points to the resemblance of colours, but in the making of his pictures Degas intriguingly interchanges the forms and subtances of unlike things. The plump nude of the Coiffure of c. 1886 (L.847) is tumbled and assaulted, on the tonal map of the monotype of c. 1892, by cottony flakes of pastel which softly refashion her into a hilly Landscape (LS 134). Another monotype (LS 136; Fig. 11) hides a stony nude in a stony terrain, while in the Landscape with water (L.1308) both river and mud recall disintegrating bodies- and so on.47 44MILLARD, op.cit. at note 41 above, p.117.

This visual necrophilia is directed primarily against the integrity of forms as such, only secondarily (and arguably) against the subject. Degas's addiction to transformation is displayed with special momentum in the three versions of that Rehearsal discussed in Part I.48 The dancers there are shown as genre characters, ephemeral and naturalistic to the point of caricature as they yawn and scratch themselves ('devordes de puces');49 but at the same time they are victims of a spell, luminous, lifeless, self-contained and doll-like. In his study of Degas's brothels, Charles Bernheimer quotes Valery: 'Degas was passionately determined to make a living being seem to grimace like a face'.50 But it is not only human figures, but the pictures themselves which appear as elaborated grimaces. His compellingly expressive images in all media are cognates in physiognomic terms. Degas's rondeau is inexhaustible. There is visual al- literation between the Young Spartans, the ballet and the racing scenes; the thinly-painted unfortunates of the Medieval war scene are echoed by those in the technically elaborated monotypes many years later. Degas changed less than it seems; his evolution was cyclic and permutative. Figures of defeat 'Edgar! . . . Edgar! . . Est-il permis que des parents vous affublent d'un nompareil?'51 Degas's indignation is congenital; he is wounded in his identity, and from the cradle. It is not easy to keep hold of the personality of this great master who at seventy-six was still not reconciled to his baptismal name. In the well-known letter to de Valernes, of 1890, we have perhaps the most direct confession of the sense of self that never wholly left him: 'Je me sentais si mal fail, si mal outille, si mou, pendant qu'il me semblait que mes calculs d'art itaient si justes, je boudais contre tout le monde et contre moi-mime.'52 Degas's sense of deficit, his lack of spontaneity, was transformed into an addiction, and the addiction into a furious productive power. The struggle for that transformation is itself the deepest theme of Degas's wuvre- a struggle he presents not as heroic, but as attuned to the constant, intimate presence of defeat. 3 In a charcoal study of c. 1878-80 (Fig. 14), Degas gives to a bony seven-or eight-year-old dancer, effortfully practising, an angelic, Della Robbia face, and near her ungainly elbow he reminds himself: 'bien accuser l'os de coude'.54 This drawing is anything but an exception; between 1878 and 1882 in particular, there is a series of disconcerting studies of young dancers who appear ill-formed, almost handicapped - 'children of a lesser god'.5" The tender appeal that Degas allows to his subject in this charcoal study, and his mordant insistence on her imperfections, are phases of projected self-love and self-distaste. Leonardo's dictum - ogni pittore dipinge se - is surely true of Degas. In his parodic reworkings of the Susanna theme - women behaving as if unobserved, 'se baignant, se lavant, se sechant, s'essuyant, se peignant ou sefaisant peigner' - as well as in his depictions of dancers exercising and at rest, Degas remakes the pictorial repertoire of vanitas. Both the sharply described little dancer in Degas's early manner, struggling with the 'grande battement a la seconde a la barre' (Fig. 14), and the monumental, isolated hair-combing figure in a late charcoal (L.1164) have the bearing of condemned souls, whose futility is at once their offence and their punishment. The same is true of the paired figures of the toilette scenes. In the Oslo Coiffure, with its overtones of illicit eroticism (see Part II, p. 265), the sickly, passive figure is a victim borrowed from a study for the Medieval war scene.

Dancers tying up their sandals, by Edgar Degas. c.1892-95. 70.5 by 200.7 cm. (Cleveland Museum of Art). the scenes of c. 1898 (Fig. 13),56 seems to have defected - fist to bosom in a codified gesture of remorse - from the cast of mythological characters in Degas's large, unfinished charcoal draft of Bathers in a landscape,57 of two years earlier, whose theme is thought to be the goddess Diana's punishment of the nymph Callisto for her unchaste con- duct;58 and her upward-strained arm harks back once more to the central victim-figure whose raised wrist is bound to the tree in the war scene.59 The consequentiality of these strands of form and meaning, running throughout Degas's work, can hardly be avoided. We have seen how, at a period when Degas as social naturalist dealt explicitly with themes of social morality, the stricken figures of the Shelburne dancers re-embodied the wretched female victims of his early work; much later, close to 1896, the standing Woman taken unawares (Fig. 15) is in its new three-dimensional form, superbly re-imagining, with its echo of the Eve of the Expulsion, the deeply-rooted theme of the woman punished.60 It was at just this time that Degas painted the last image of the Jockey blessi, metaphor of all defeat, failure and death, in which the rider appears as the guiltless victim of misfortune, his open, insubstantial body received, almost absorbed by the grassy earth. But the Woman taken unawares, turning spirally inwards yet exposed on every side, is marked by her humiliation as the miserable victim of a moral punishment; Germain Bazin, in 1931, called the sculpture Lafemme blesske, and saw in her a re-emergence of Degas's archetypalfemme dishonorde.61 Both these works of defeat - the fallen jockey, the Eve of the Fall - speak of the artist's self-involvement with his subject; but it is the woman who is Degas's lifelong pain-bearer and whose pain reflects his own.62 Envoi In the early 1890s, Degas produced the unique and daring composition, Dancers tying up their sandals, now in Cleveland (Fig. 16).63 This monumental sequence, aud- aciously stitched together from four versions of the fleeting, recurrent motif, is an apotheosis of repetition, a visionary conjugation of Degas's espaliered forms. Two metres wide, with the insubstantiality of cosmic dust and moonlight, it is closely akin, in its thinly spread pigment, mysterious colour and calligraphic outlines, to the late red canvases; the unorthodox narrow colour-range also connects it with the thrillingly blue Moscow pastel. Here the tones are close to grisaille- but animated by weightless, intimate jade-green shadows and by the four warm touches of hair spaced at mid-height along the extended rectangle. In its overall concept, the closest affinity of the Cleveland frieze, as Stuckey has observed is with the sequence at the barre in the Widener classroom, to which we have frequently returned. Both play out horizontally an exquisitely protracted ornamental melody, with something of the hypnotic continuity of Islamic decoration. But the Cleveland sequence is also cyclic, in an unforced, nonchalant manner. It proposes, side by side, four different views of the same model, the last figure the reverse of the first. Austere and playful, this minimalist display - endless, evenly stressed, without overlap or fragmentation - is an extended and beautifully articulated draft of one single, inexhaustible subject. Degas's four women bend and turn, modelled in cloudy light and shadow, like the waxing and waning moon. '. .. je ne veux pas que tu me defends comme tu fais, en disant que je suis un vieux fou', Degas reproached Ludovic Halkvy, 'Il faut dire que je suis un philosophe. Pas un fou, un philosophe, un vieux philosophe'.65 56Pushkin Museum, Moscow (L.1274). This is apparently the first work in a series that includes L.1344, L.1352 and L.1264, the Four dancers (see Part I, fig.35). 57 Vente Degas, IV:254; Mus'e des Arts D coratifs, Paris (Cat. 1988, fig.314). 58 Vente Degas, 111:337.1. This work is thought to be connected to the artist's unrealised projects for a large work on the myth of Diana and Actaeon; see TINTEROW in Cat. 1988, p.558. 59The affinity between these two figures is mentioned by E. PARRY JANIS in Degas,form and space cited at note 23 above, p.473. 60TINTEROW (Cat. 1988, pp.558-60), tellingly connects the Woman taken unawares and its preparatory studies with the Eve of Masaccio's Expulsion in the Brancacci chapel. The charcoal sketch of an Eve figure, connected by MILLARD, (op.cit. at note 41 above, p.142) with the Eve of Rodin's Gates of Hell, should also be considered in this context. 61BAZIN: op.cit. at note 22 above, pp.292-301. Bazin finds the first examples of Degas'sfemmes dishonories in the Medieval war scene. He includes in the type also the female figure study (L.351; now in Basel), preparatory to L'Intirieur of c. 1868-69, with its extraordinary charge both of sexuality and of lost dignity. Bazin's contributions, far from fading in the light of recent Degas studies, re- emerge as central to two important themes: Degas's spaces, and Degas's women. See also his comprehensive one-page article, 'Degas et l'Objectif', L'Amour de I'Art [1931], p.304. 62Berthe Morisot recalled how in 1869, in a vein of ironic gallantry, Degas subjected her to a lengthy commentary on the proverb of Solomon, 'woman is the downfall of the righteous man'. (B. MORISOT: Correspondance, ed. D. ROUART, Paris [1950], p.23). 63This is Degas's largest work, once owned by the painter Max Liebermann. 64STUCKEY, loc.cit. at note 47 above, p.46. 65See D.
