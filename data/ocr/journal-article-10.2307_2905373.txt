<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wayne C. Booth, The Company We Keep: An Ethics of Fiction. Berkeley and Los Angeles: The University of California Press, 1988. 557 pages. The defects of Booth's massive tome become obvious after the first 100 pages of reading. Further reading confirms and, if anything, deepens the first impression. The book is garrulous and overly long, nervously defen- sive, eager to please and to shed a certain formality (or is it formalism?), and embarrassingly apologetic. (The vision of a donkey-eared scholar ex- ercising rueful self-criticism over his deviations in front of Maoist zealots must have come to the mind of more than one malicious reader.) Even the avalanche of otherwise apt and occasionally delightful quotations and mottoes suggests a kind of desolate bad conscience: "these fragments I have shored against my ruins." Repetitions, chattiness and scholarly jitters ought not to divert us from the seriousness of Booth's enterprise, nor from its more than partial suc- cesses. Ethical criticism has a respectable ancestry in American culture, as the names of Babbitt and More in particular can confirm, and several good recent critics such as Tobin Siebers, Hillis Miller, Lilian Furst, Chris- topher Clausen along with a number of others (the book has an enormous bibliography, 506-534) have shown that interest in this approach may be reviving. Booth believes that "ethical criticism" is a framework broad and</page><page sequence="2">MLN 1179 comprehensive enough to host the multiple variants of political, ideolog- ical and "bias"-filled forms of contemporary analysis and to provide some rules for their civilized coexistence. The first part of his book (1-155) argues that value judgments are not only possible, but inevitable. Ethical criticism is the broadest and thickest layer underlying such continuous value judgments and rhetorical, no less than ideological criticism rests on it. The possible questions are outlined well, without undue pre-emption of the range of possible answers. Booth is, with M. H. Abrams and E. D. Hirsch, one of the few "intentionalists" among contemporary American critics (92), but he is a "weakly evaluative" critic (in the same way in which others discern a "weakly epistemological" content in literature). Maintaining his habitual pluralist stance, Booth in- troduces (72-73) the term "coduction" (a bringing out or drawing out to- gether of meaning and value) which implies a continuous comparison of one's own judgment and experience with those of "other more or less qualified observers." Booth's expositions owe much to the philosophical descriptions of Hilary Putnam, as well as to "possible world" theorists like Dolezel and Pavel. However, a more solid philosophical foundation for ethical criticism can be achieved only by some resort to early twentieth- century axiologists like Max Scheler, G. E. Moore, C. I. Lewis and, above all, Nicolai Hartmann, whose very systematic Ethics would have much strengthened Booth's analytical probings. Even so, the full turn of the wheel from the disclaimer of value (and of value judgments) to an aware- ness of a superabundance of valuations is a gesture of intellectual honesty and one that was overdue in the face of current trends. The strongest section of the book is the second (157-373). Here Booth introduces his metaphor of books as "friends" and of reading as friend- ship and gift. These pages are often warm, erudite, eloquent, obviously personal, indeed of a playfully subdued eroticism. Friendship is chosen because it is a convenient semantic intersection where the ethical and the gratuitous intersect (173-4). Gratuitousness is, of course, the quality most pitilessly pursued by modern utilitarians of all stripes, a quality identified often with literariness itself. By the very use of the friendship metaphor, Booth engages in that time-honored theoretical genre, the apology of the literary (or even of canonicity). Naturally, some of the lines of argument are thus recapitulations of pleas we have heard over the centuries: the Wordsworthian and Schillerian assertion of the moral effects of reading and cultural engagement (281-287), or even the portrait of metaphors as offers and giving (318-319), as well as the conclusions, which are as Amer- ican as apple pie (this does not make them wrong), that recommend plu- rality of voices and mutual criticism, but do not exclude some constraints in the acceptance or classification of all possible critical views (348, also 489-"a pluralism with limits"). Others are newer, such as "the unique value of fiction: its relatively cost-free offer of trial runs ... In a month of reading, I can try out more 'lives' than I can test in a lifetime" (485; this</page><page sequence="3">1180 REVIEWS was an argument made over a decade ago in some detail by Umberto Eco). Other points again seem to me quite new and exciting, and well worth further exploration, such as the claim that literature is a main way of solving the opposition between egoism and altruism (266). In reading this section one may puzzle over the bizarre intermixing of Burke and Mailer (most of Chapter 11), one may regret the author's ignorance of Urs von Balthasar's "Theodramatics" in the otherwise promising discussion of role and reality (259), one may reflect that even the effect of pornography (393-394) is more complicated than the author makes it out to be, and one may think that an awareness of Frederick Garber's fundamental contribu- tions to the question of individuality in nineteenth-century writing would have enriched that discussion (240). However these and other drawbacks are more than made up by the impressive display of Wayne Booth's ana- lytical skills: his excellent, patient, and concrete descriptions of how litera- ture works, what happens to the reader during the reading process (e.g., 339, but virtually throughout the book), what happens during rereading (437-439 and elsewhere)-these are skills in the practice of which few critics surpass Booth. Yet the third section (377-482) is a letdown. It is meant to illustrate ethical criticism in action by a series of analyses of Rabelais, Jane Austen, D. H. Lawrence and Mark Twain. These pieces almost manage to undo what had been achieved in the first two thirds of the book and they rein- force our instinctive mistrust of ethical criticism, by illustrating how it lowers intellectual sophistication and by reminding us of the dangers of simplification lurking in it (410-413, or 398-399). Ultimately the strengths and the weaknesses of Wayne Booth seem to derive from an impulse towards synthesis and compromise, and a desire to respond to large intellectual and institutional pressures. These are the kinds of qualities that can lead and have led to great results, as the oeuvres of a Kenneth Burke, M. Bakhtin or W. Iser will attest. Wayne Booth seeks to continue this line (341). His accommodating rationality stands in pleasant contrast with the professionalized sourness of many of his col- leagues. The biblio-anthropomorphism put forward is intriguing, attrac- tive and sophisticated. And the collection of quotations and little pieces that closes the book deserves all praise, reminiscent as it is of Macrobius and Aullus Gellius. (Let me quickly mention a few typos on pp. 82, 85, 87, 209, 300, 303.) As part of Booth's own development, The Company We Keep indicates an increased availability for conversation, dialog and flexible definition, but not a growth of creative energy.
