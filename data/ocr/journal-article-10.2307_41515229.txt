Schneekloth School of Architecture and Planning Stale University of New York at Buffalo ABSTRACT The tendency to value vegetation as insignificant background, as "nothing," is rooted in our cultural myths and taught to our children. Some forms of discourse, such as drawings and literature, suggest different systems of placing value. The roots of our current biases and their implication for children's perception and experience are discussed. INTRODUCTION As we sat around the community dinner table at the Pension FlorMar at Monteverde, Costa Rica, our conversation revolved around our individual experiences of the day in the forest. The forest preserve at Monteverde is an extraordinary tropical cloud forest, primal and pristine, on the Pacific coast of the country. Someone asked, "What did you see today?" The immediate response was, "Nothing." Nothing? In spite of the endless shades of green, incredibly diverse textures marching up and down the rugged terrain, spots of such intense color that it appeared that someone had mounted artificial flowers throughout the forest, a dance of mist, rain, and light throughout the day, microenvironments which supported radically diverse plant communities within a single glance - all of this was "nothing." What had my dinner companions been looking for that made them so blind? "Something," for them, would have been an animal, not alien vegetation rooted in space, but a creature like us who moved through the landscape. What accounts for our ability to dismiss vegetation as either non- existent or unimportant? Where do we learn such interpretation and valuation? Are plants always invisible or are there forms of discourse in which vegetation is validated without conscious thought? And why should we care? Observations of young children reveal that vegetation can be a major play material, transformed through actions into whatever it needs to be, appreciated for its receptivity to children's actions. Yet, the culture in which our children live communicates meanings of what plants are, how one feels about them, and how one treats them. Children receive conflicting messages from adults: vegetables are good for you, eat them; parks and forests are wonderful, protect them; weeds are awful, spray them; trees are for making products, cut them down; we need to build something here, bulldoze the trees. In this context, how do children develop a sense of plants as a community of beings? What do we teach them? That vegetation is "nothing"? My intent is to present some thoughts and discussion about the way we categorize vegetation as "nothing" as the dominant message that children receive. If we aspire to have our children develop a more bio-centric, even eco-centric view of the world, we have to understand what they are being taught explicitly and implicitly.1 Photo: R. Moore THE ROOTS OF INVISIBILITY By what means does vegetation become nothing? One interpreta- tion suggests that the pervasiveness of the experience of vegetation structures its position in human perception as background. Another interpretation is based on the distinct difference between our learned, scientific knowledge of the world, and our culturally-dependent experiences of the same world. A third interpretation is that our anthropocentric culture assigns utilitarian value to other life forms. Vegetation as background In the United States, except in parts of the largest cities, we live in the midst of vegetation. It forms the background environment of our existence. And so the forest at Monteverde was not seen because it was the background for the active search for something else. As part of our biological being, homo sapiens appears to have preferences for certain kinds of stimuli in the world around us - we seek out the different, the novel, the complex (Berlyne, 1966). Gestalt psychology has shown us that the background, or environ- ment, has a critical role to play in this active seeking for and passive reception of information. It forms the field against which things that are different have importance. It is the clearing in the forest, the 14 Children's Environments Quarterly</page><page sequence="2">edge of the woods, and the civic square that marks our experience and memory. And yet the clearing cannot exist without the woods, the edge would be illegible without the field, and the square non- existent without the surrounding mass of buildings. There is another aspect to background which is germane to this discussion. Things move from background to foreground when they are important, when we need them. One might perceive that vegetation would occupy a primal place in our culture because it forms the basis of our food - that with which we nourish ourselves and sustain our lives. In many traditional cultures there are still festivals and other markers which celebrate plants as the food of life (Campbell, 1986). However, in our post-industrial, late twentieth-century world, the vegetation that is viewed as background and "vegetables" that are placed on children's plates are conceptually disassociated. Food comes from the grocery store. The role of plants as the basis for the food chain and our ultimate life sustainer is invisible. Even though the situation may be changing as food is more and more perceived as potentially "dangerous" because of health concerns related to additives, processing, and pesticides, this transformation in our perception may further alienate vegetation and make it a substance to be feared rather than a sustainer of life. Experience and scientific knowledge The separation of vegetables from vegetation is an example of the vast divide between what we think of as "knowledge" and what we experience as earthbound human beings whose lives are formed by our culture and perceptions. We still say that the sun rises and sets because it is how we experience the phenomena. Campbell (1986) suggests that the publication in AD 1543 of Copernicus' Six Books on the Revolutions of the Celestial Orbs was fateful because "the recognized idea of the earth in relation to outer space became forever separated from the daily experience of the same. An intellectual concept had refuted and displaced the nevertheless persistent sensory регсерГ (p. 43). We are not the thoroughly modern people we think we are. The experience of the world by the scientist as described by Loren Eiseley is not the world of most of us: In the more obscure scientific circles which I frequent there is a legend circulating about a late distinguished scientist, who, in his declining years, persisted in wearing enormous padded boots much too large for him. He had developed, it seems, what to his fellows was a wholly irrational fear of falling through the interstices of that largely empty molecular space which common men in their folly speak of as the world. A stroll across his living-room floor had become, for him, something as dizzily horrendous as the activities of a window-washer on the Empire State Building. This was the natural world which he had helped create, and in which, at last, he had found himself a lonely and imprisoned occupant. All around him the ignorant rushed on their way over the illusion of substantial floors, leaping, though they did not see it, from particle to particle, over a bottomless abyss (1978, p.280). Our knowledge of plants as species has grown incredibly in the last century. We now know and understand much about their complexity and integrity, their history, life cycles, relationships, and our dependence on them. Recent research has uncovered their astonish- ing chemical diversity. More than 10,000 different chemical "secondary compounds," are found in the tissue of plants which are not used in the regular physiology and metabolism of the plant. They are often of bizarre and novel composition, and essentially fuel the endless chemical warfare with herbivores conducted by species that cannot run away. Even more astounding is the fact that these chemicals are not always present but emerge under attack and somehow communicate to other plants nearby that the particular chemical should be generated (Forsyth &amp; Mikyata, 1984). It is these same chemicals that have been so enormously helpful to human beings as medicines. The more we learn about plants, the more we understand that they are self-regulating organisms of immense diversity. And yet, in our common experience, we view them solely as an undifferentiated utilitarian "resource.". This mundane view limits us; we appear unable to understand and identify with plants sufficiently to incorpo- rate what we know into what we experience. Our skill at selective breeding of plants to reinforce particular traits, for both economic and aesthetic reasons, along with genetic engineer- ing and biotechnology, have increased dramatically the human harnessing of plant power in service of our own ends. We have assumed perhaps a wholly unjustified and dangerous sense of control and domination of the plant kingdom, dangerous because it gives us a false sense of security and reduces the sense of actual dependency on the plant world as со -inhabitants of the biosphere. Anthropocentrism We live in a culture which has isolated human beings from other forms of life and elevated our species to a superior position. The manipulation of plants genetically for our purposes is but one example. However, there is a growing acceptance of the idea that life is interdependent, forcing us to see ourselves as located within nature instead of outside of it. Even so, current arguments for the preserva- tion of species in the tropical forests, for example, are grounded in an anthropocentric and economic perspective that places value on these species because they may contain substances (mostly produced as secondary compounds mentioned above) that could have pharmaceu- tical and other forms of industrial application. According to Taylor (1986), there are three historical ideas firmly embedded and largely invisible in our culture which form the basic premise of human superiority: (1 ) the capacity for reason and rationality, grounded in classical Greek philosophy, as the essence of human nature that is not possessed by other species; (2) the idea of "soul" which separates us from other animals, referring to the medieval concept of the Great Chain of Being; and (3) the dualistic theory in the philosophy of Descartes asserting that human beings are comprised of minds and bodies, and that the "mind" is the most important and unique aspect. Taylor suggests that it is "unreasonable to judge non-humans by the values of human civilization, rather than by values connected with what it is for a member of that species to live a good life" (1986, p. 131). He contends that these arguments for human superiority are based on assertion. All species are different; only in our arbitrary hierarchical ordering does difference become "better." In cultures such as some Native Americans, differences are recognized, and celebrated. Prayers are said to animals before the kill, and festivals are held to the deities of the crops. In contrast, our materialistic culture has no connective rituals or myths that serve the same purpose of reminding ourselves of such relationships. We have no forums in which to recognize and celebrate otherness and interdepen- dency. Our relegation of vegetation to "background," our continuing dis association between experience and knowledge, and our anthropo- centrism have had pervasive influences on the way in which our Vol. 6, No. 1, (Spring) 1989 15</page><page sequence="3">children learn about themselves and the other species which share this planet These three phenomena form the basis for the valuation of vegetation by the dominant culture and limit the interpretation of experiences of children with the world of plants. VEGETATION RE-PRESENTED This inquiry into the "invisible" character of vegetation in human experience raises interesting questions. Is its invisibility present in all forms of discourse? Is it possible that humans attend to vegetation outside of language, for example, as revealed in their actions or drawings? Vegetation in drawing To explore the human perception of vegetation, I asked two different groups of people to draw a picture of an experience, place, or activity that was important in forming their relationship with nature. I then asked them to share this epiphany event. And although the two groups were very different (one was environmental educators and the other graduate students in architecture), a simple content analysis of their drawings revealed striking similarities.2 Vegetation was represented in 84% of the drawings, with 74% of those drawings using vegetation as the main focus of the drawing. Almost half (45%) of the drawings with vegetation also included other species, human and/or animals. Also, 39% included some form of human construction, such as a dwelling, tent, bridge, etc.3 The people included in the drawings were often alone, and their attention was focused on the environment rather than each other. Further, the people in the pictures were shown with smiles and serene expressions. The scale of presentation of the various parts of the pictures was revealing. People were almost always presented as "part" of the picture, with the other elements larger and clearly as important as the figure. In 5 of the 103 drawings, snails, ants, grass, birds, and flowers were actually drawn much larger than the people. In contrast to verbal descriptions, drawings showed people as only one part of the recalled experiences . Table 1 Content of drawings Educators Students Totals Feature N % N % N % Vegetation 68 82 14 93 82 84 background 16 24 5 36 21 26 focus 52 76 9 64 61 74 Vegetation &amp; people 34 41 3 21 37 45 Vegetation &amp; buildings 21 31 11 79 32 39 Vegetation &amp; animals 35 51 3 21 38 46 Total 83 15 98 Of those pictures which did not contain vegetation, most were critiques of our social order. Humans were shown doing harm to the natural environment through depictions of smoky factories, trucks dumping, weapons, etc. The general message from all the drawings is that an individual's relationship with nature can be formed and/or reinforced either from beneficial experiences with nature, such as walks in the woods, or from negative experiences involving humans violating other species or their habitat. There was a fascinating difference between the contents of the drawings and the narratives shared about them. When people drew their experience, they located human beings as part of the picture; when they talked about the place/event, the human action was central. It appears that different modes of representation - drawing and language - bring different parts of an experience into the discourse. Drawings give "somethingness" to the world of plants; it is our language which renders it invisible.4 Very few respondents spoke of the particulars of the place or of the pervasive vegetation visible in their drawings. Describing experience only in terms of the self instead of describ- ing the world as it is, is a cultural artifact of the world we live in today. Hillman suggests that as modem creatures we have refocused our adjectives which qualify the world, from the world to talking about ourselves: The world comes with shapes, colors, atmospheres, textures - a display of self-presenting forms. All things show faces, the world not only a coded signature to be read for meaning, but a physiognomy to be faced. As expressive forms, things speak; they show the shape they are in. They announce themselves, bear witness to their presence: "Look, here we are." They regard us beyond how we may regard them, our perspectives, what we intend with them, and how we dispose of them. This imaginative claim on attention bespeaks a world ensouled. More - our imaginative recognition, the childlike act of imagining the world, animates the world and returns it to soul (1982). Vegetation is "something" as is revealed in the discourse of draw- ings; it is given form. Literature There are wonderful pieces of literature in our culture which re- present vegetation to children in ways that metaphorically give 16 Children's Environments Quarterly</page><page sequence="4">foreground presence and being to this alien life form. In The Little Prince (de Saint-Exupery, 1943), a story unfolds about how the Little Prince, who lived alone on a tiny planet, left the beautiful flower he had grown to love, because the flower had such pride that it ruined the serenity of the small world. He travels to Earth where he comes to understand how much he loves and longs for the flower: The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her. ..(p. 32). The flower is willful but presented as vulnerable. In contrast, the Ents in The Return of the King by J. R. R. Tolkein (1965) were strong and mighty creatures which rose up, strode across the land, and helped fight the forces of evil. Yet in the story they are vulnerable in their strength because eventually there will be no more Ents and their majesty will pass away with the end of Middle Earth and the dawning of the age of people. One of the most imaginative stories which involves a creature that is rooted like a tree is found in Madelaine L'Engle's book, A Wind in the Door (1973). During their youth these creatures, the farae, are not rooted, and roam freely, not unlike seeds. But at maturity, the "farae deepen," become rooted, inseparable, and sing with the stars. One of the little fara, Sporos, is being sorely tempted to refuse to deepen. He is coaxed by a mature fara: It is true, small offspring. Now that I am rooted I am no longer limited by motion. Now I may move anywhere in the universe. I sing with the stars. I dance with the galaxies. I share in the joy - and in the grief (p. 190). These are three of the many magical images of vegetation offered to children in stories and myth. They counter the prevailing dismissal of plants by offering a vision of a life form that is compelling even though different. Although the means of presentation in the literature is anthropomorphic, it makes connections and offers visions. Children appear to prefer animals that are more familiar and human-like. In a report prepared for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Stephen Kellert and Joyce Berry (1980) report that children's preferences for animals start with domestic animals, continue to "attractive animals," to birds, and then to invertebrates. As children grow, they expand the circle of significant others, which can include other species. The stories described above connect with children's preferences, yet expand the limitations of experience by engaging the world of fantasy. SUMMARY Even with the enriched images from stories, and play experiences with plants that appreciate plants for their interactive qualities, children may not see the trees. And why should we expect young people to challenge the tenets of the dominant culture in its valuation of vegetation? As adults, we have lost the young child's ability to give presence to the world; we cannot animate the strange family of species who live so differently from us. "As adults, we are preoccupied with living. As a consequence, we see little," (Eiseley, 1978, p. 54). If , indeed, very young children can experience plants differently before they are taught that plants are invisible, how can we facilitate and validate their more connective relationship? Surely this must be part of our mission in teaching our children about our home, Earth, and the per- petuation of all other species with which we share it planet. And how can we, as adults, retain our childhood perceptions? How can we expand our true understanding of the world by comprehend- ing and embracing a form of life so different from ourselves - which needs us not at all, but upon which our lives depend? NOTES 1. The recent philosophical discourses by Foucault (1970) and Derrida (1976) presume that the invisible and unstated in any culture plays a significant role. Those things to which we don't attend, the "excluded other," have presence as shapers of culture, as important as those things to which we do attend. Our world of ideas, language, and typological constructions, those which we recognize and those which we cannot acknowledge, are inextrica- bly bound up in, and form our interpretations of and projections on, our social and physical world. 2. The first was a group of 83 professionals who worked in fields of natural history and environmental education who had gathered for a forum in October 1988, "Breaking the Barriers: Linking Children with Nature," sponsored by the Roger Tory Peterson Institute, Jamestown, New York. The second group was a design studio of 15 students in the graduate architectural program at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Both groups were primarily western, college educated, and all had an expressed interest in envi- ronmental/landscape issues. 3. There was a fascinating, but not surprising difference between the professional environmental educators and the architecture students in the category of human construction. The architecture students included built form and constructions in 79% of their drawings; the educators only in 31%. Does this mean we are influenced by different experiences which form our vocational interests? Or do we reconstrua our history and experiences to reflect the choices we have made? 4. R. Moore (1986) comments on the richness of expression and diversity of content of children's drawings of their environment as compared to the paucity of expression in their verbal descriptions. It appears that such a difference continues into the adult domain even when one's language skills are more developed. REFERENCES Berlyne, D. E. ( 1966). Curiosity and exploration.
