<plain_text><page sequence="1">In Honor of Douglas Vickers Beyond Studies in the theory of money: a tribute to the scholarship of Douglas Vickers INGRID H. RIMA For as long as I have known him, Douglas Vickers has always referred to that subdiscipline which most of us call, simply, "the history of economic thought" as "intellectual history." His far grander designation is not, however, mere affectation. Rather, it captures the very essence of Vickers' scholarship, whose leitmotiv is the conceptual "oneness" of human knowledge. His research reflects the view that while the division of knowledge into the sciences and their subspecialties is a necessary heu- ristic or teaching device, when we turn our attention to the problems of the real world, understanding typically calls for interdisciplinary exper- tise. In those fondly remembered days, when geographical distance inter- posed no barrier to our conversations, we would often begin a discussion with an economic question, and proceed quickly on to related themes in politics, sociology, history, ethics, philosophy, and theology. On more than one occasion he even interspersed a Shakespearian sonnet or a favorite bit of verse before returning to the original theme. More often than not, that theme related in some fashion to "money." Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that when, quoting from John Law (1720), Vickers wrote as a preamble to his Studies in the Theory ofMoney (1959), "There are good reasons to think that the nature of money is not yet rightly understood,"' he also laid the cornerstone for his considerable contribution as an economist. Not only has he pioneered new vistas in the intellectual history of preclassical writers, who are usually dismissed as mere "pamphleteers," but, more importantly, his critical assessment The author is Professor of Economics at Temple University. 214 Journal of Post Keynesian Economics / Winter 1989-90, Vol. 12, No. 2</page><page sequence="2">BEYOND "STUDIES IN THE THEORY OF MONEY" 215 of neoclassical theorizing about the nature and uses of money underlies his subsequent pioneering contribution to clarifying the cost of capital as it relates to the theory of the firm and its investment decisions. It is in this connection that money emerges as the essential link between the interdependent decisions undertaken at the level of the business firm with respect to production, investment, and finance. Vickers' articulation of what he termed, "the analytical trilogy of the production problem, the investment problem and the financing problem" (1968, p. 102) is like- wise undertaken with the keen insight of an intellectual historian. As will be more fully developed in the sections that follow, it is Vickers' unique ability to address issues in their historical perspective that invariably provides his initial building block in the discovery of new truths. I. Vickers' high repute as the profession's foremost authority about preclassical contributions to monetary economics is reaffirmed in a recent sextet of necessarily brief entries in The New Palgrave celebrat- ing the contributions of Nicholas Barbon, Dudley North, Edward Misselden, Josiah Child, Joshua Gee, and Henry Martin. These mini- biographies about those little-known and underappreciated merchant- economists and essayists of the mercantilist era, recall his first book, Studies in the Theory of Money 1690-1776(1959), which has achieved rare distinction as a modem classic. His early intellectual interest in the monetary theories of preclassical writers proved not merely to be the starting point for his research agenda as an intellectual historian; it also established a conceptual approach to economics and a perspective about its vast potential as a discipline to be harnessed in the service of humankind. His own maturing scholarship has steadily strengthened this commitment. Vickers came into academic economics at the close of the 1950s, when the counterrevolution initiated by John Hicks' "Mr. Keynes and the 'Classics'" (1937) against Keynes' General Theory had already become firmly entrenched. The neoclassical paradigm was being rearticulated in writings such as those of A. C. Pigou (1947) and Alvin Hansen (1949, 1953). Together with Patinkin's work (1948), they effectively countered Keynes' less than full employment argument with the notion that, in principle, "the real balance effect" can restore commodity, bond, and labor markets to equilibria consistent with full employment. Given the vigor of this counterrevolution against Keynes, Vickers' reinterpretation</page><page sequence="3">216 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS of preclassical monetary theory as a theory of employment that has relevance for economies in which the level of economic activity might leave people involuntarily unemployed, was fundamentally different from the then dominant view of the functioning of the macroeconomy. Examination of the particular contributions of individual writers was, of course, the principle objective of his Studies in the Theory of Money. But Vickers' concern was also to reaffirm Keynes' retreat from the postulates of classical analysis. Although presented within the context of preclassical thinking, it was an essential part of Vickers' argument that money is not simply a "veil" without relevance for the determination of the real magnitudes of the system. Both Keynes and Vickers credited the mercantilists with understanding the relationship between the supply of money and the level of trading activity and employment that an economy can support. Thus, in retrospect, Vickers' Studies in the Theory ofMoney is clearly a forerunner of the now flourishing post Keynesian tradition. That this aspect of his scholarship was not immediately recognized is, no doubt, attributable to the fact that in the 1950s scholarship in economics had already become characterized by an intellectual hiatus between contemporary theory and the history of thought. So swept up was the profession with the IS-LM market clearing paradigm that the relevance of Vickers' Studies in the Theory ofMoney as an intellectual dissent from the mainstream appears to have gone unnoticed.1 Not only did Vickers hail the mercantilists for their anticipation of Keynes' own later appreciation of the relationship between the level of aggregate demand and the supply of money, he also praised their under- standing of the role that expenditure flows have in generating the eco- nomic process that creates employment opportunities. His concern was to examine "the ways in which the economic problems of the time gave rise to the internal development of a theory of money designed for their explanation" (1959, p. 295). Vickers' praise was for the mercantilists' analytical contributions, which he urged should not be obscured from contemporary appreciation in consequence of the "sophisticated-an- thropomorphic offense" of "not recognizing the equivalent content in older writers because they do not use the terminology and symbols of the 1 Sidney Weintraub's Classical Keynesianism, Monetary Theory and the Price Level (1961) followed Vickers' Studies in the Theory of Money (1959) by two years. Yet, the acknowledgment to Weintraub in the Preface suggests that although his own book was chiefly concerned with preclassical monetary theory, Vickers' interpretation of the mercantilists and Weintraub's objective to counter what he called "Hicksian Keynesianism" have a clear intellectual kinship.</page><page sequence="4">BEYOND "STUDIES IN THE THEORY OF MONEY" 217 present."2 Even Joseph Schumpeter, Vickers observed elsewhere (1970b), failed to appreciate fully the remarkable sophistication embed- ded in the writings of Sir James Steuart, whose work he dismissed as "having made so little headway and slipped up so often that the prom- ising beginning was lost. .." (Schumpeter, 1954, pp. 176,296). Vickers' counterevaluation of Steuart's work was based on the recognition this last great mercantilist gave to the impact on the economy of an elastic money supply, which results from the establishment of banks and their creation of money substitutes (Vickers, 1970b, p. 1193). Our great intellectual debt to the latter-day mercantilists, according to Vickers, lies in their recognition that "the monetary economic system would not, if left to itself, necessarily function at a high and stable level of economic activity. Indeed, it is in the understanding of this very fact, and the construction of a body of monetary analysis directed to the explication of it, that we find the important distinguishing features of the preclassical literature" (ibid., p. 1191). Preclassical economics deserves closer study because "it should afford us a truer view... of the problems and policies of the mixed economy we have to live with in our own day" (ibid., p. 1195). Vickers concluded his Studies in the Theory of Money with a lament: specifically, that the direction taken by the theorists of the following century "point(ed) away from what had been the main preoccupation of the nascent macroanalysis of the eighteenth century. " His regret was that writers of the classical tradition did not concern themselves with either the problem of the underemployment of labor or the possibility of redundant money supplies, while Sir James Steuart was cognizant of both (Vickers, 1959, p. 304). Instead of building on Steuart's insights "what the classicists chose to take over from their predecessors was the notion of equilibrium on the one hand and that of a constant level of the money flow on the other" (ibid., p. 305). To those who know Vickers' work as it evolved during the almost three decades that have elapsed since the publication of Studies in the Theory of Money, it is perfectly plain that his lament about the failings of the classicals vis-d-vis their predecessors applies with equal force to the intellectual wrong-headedness of "new classicals," neo-Keynesians, and neo-Walrasians. Indeed, his lament about the failings of the contem- 2 Vickers notes Samuelson's warning that economists need also to guard against the anthropomorphic offense of reading modern analysis into older writers' works (1959, p. 10).</page><page sequence="5">218 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS porary mainstream is, if anything, even more deeply held, if one is to judge from his seemingly tireless current efforts to argue that the theory of money must revolve around the meaning of uncertainty and ignorance. His urging is that economists must set aside the general equilibrium theoretic reconstruction that has been wrought by the contemporary mainstream. This paradigm completely misunderstands that Keynes was not at all interested in stable equilibria, but in a monetary economy that is "liable to change without much warning, and sometimes substan- tially." Reiterating Keynes' argument, Vickers has adopted a post Keynesian (or, in his preferred language, a "post Classical") perspective that calls for a further development of the theory of money under the following six headings (1979). First, greater attention must be accorded to the impact of changes in banking and financial institutions. Expressed in the lan- guage of the Preface to his recent text, Money, Banking and the Macroeconomy, "Good and relevant theory needs to be informed by sound institutional awareness (1985, ix). Second, a more exhaustive analysis of the endogenous aspects of changes in the money supply needs to be undertaken. Third, it is necessary to rediscover Keynes' theory of the money wage rate-particularly the significance of changes in the money wage and the way in which it feeds through to price formation. Fourth, perspective is needed on the manner in which major changes in expectations can induce changes in the financing methods and the possibility, c la Minsky, of debt-induced cyclical instability. This point has important implications for examining the relationship between the sources of money capital financing and "the full marginal cost of relaxing the firm's money capital availability constraint." Fifth, a new effort is required to bring into focus Keynes' viewpoint about the meaning of uncertainty. Sixth, there is need to develop a framework for decision analysis that rests on the Keynes-Shackle notion of "potential surprise' and "possibility' ratherthan on statistical probability. Vickers himself has made substantial contributions to this six-point agenda. The most important among them relates to the role of a money capital availability constraint for the investment decisions of business firms. This is addressed in the next section. II. Vickers' contribution to the theory of the firm is very much anchored in his appreciation of the intellectual history of capital theory. Thus, he is</page><page sequence="6">BEYOND "STUDIES IN THE THEORY OF MONEY" 219 critical of those who approach the question of rational decision-making by the firm about capital by means of reasoning from the principle of labor's diminishing marginal product and extending it, by analogy, to the marginal product of money capital. The logical defect he finds in their simplistic approach derives from their adherence to the historical cleav- age between the theory of production and the theory of capital. Unmind- ful of the integrated production-capital theory approaches already pioneered by Knut Wickell and Bohm-Bawerk, contemporary theorizing about the firm has become focused on production, factor use, and output and price problems, to the exclusion of problems of capital investment and finance. Given this failing, Vickers identifies the distinction made by OskarLange (1936) between money capital and real capital as holding an important clue on which to base the further development of the theory of the firm, by discarding the barrier between production and capital theory. For Lange, money capital is not a factor of production, but rather constitutes general command over productive resources. In his view, the money capital requirement function of the firm should be confronted with the available money capital supply, for the latter imposes a constraint against which the product, output, and factor combination optimization process needs to be worked out. Lange's insight led Vickers to proceed on a logic that rejects the conventional assumption that firms are always able to choose the "best" method of production. Implicit in this view is the mistaken premise that production proceeds "in a state of perfect saturation with capital." The reality of the real world of finance is that decision-making is always subject to a "money capital availability constraint" (1968, especially ch. 6). Thus, the firm confronts interdependent decision problems with respect to production, asset investment, and finance. The availability conditions of money capital to the firm significantly affect the "money capital intensity" surrounding the employment of factors of production. The production structure of the firm depends upon the availability conditions of money capital, so that the relevant "cost of capital" to the firm is the equivalent of the full marginal cost of relaxing the money capital availability constraint. From this Vickers infers that decision- makers respond to a higher marginal cost of money capital by adopting production structures that economize on money capital intensive factors. Thus, he dissents from the conclusion, principally associated with Fama and Miller and Modigliani, that production decisions are independent of financing decisions.</page><page sequence="7">220 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS The Fama-Miller-Modigliani view, which is shared by many others in the mainstream, is critically dependent on the Walrasian postulate that markets are in every sense perfect, equilibrating instantaneously and without cost. Thus, the firm's investment decision is viewed as simply relating to changes in the scale of production, which leaves aside the whole problem of factor proportions as well as the firm's risk position. The accepted investment decision criterion is to evaluate the present value of an expected future stream of cash flows in relation to the firm's "cost of capital," from which it follows that a project is a worthwhile undertaking if the present value estimate exceeds the cost of undertaking it. But this simplistic formula "imports" equilibrium data for use as a decision criterion that leaves out of consideration "realism and reliability" in actual situations requiring financial decisions (Vickers, 1975 and 1978). Vickers' point is that Walrasian capital theory cannot provide decision rules that are relevant to a non-Walrasian world in which false trading occurs and transactions take place in historic time and at non-equilibrium prices. No contemporary critic of the mainstream has been more eloquent than Douglas Vickers in arguing the case for developing a socially relevant economics by giving up reliance on simplifying assumptions that cannot possibly yield conclusions meaningful to the real world. His special objection is to the standard assumption that markets are both complete and perfect, so that equilibrium is instantaneously and costlessly attained. Thus, his objection extends even to " such important work as that of Jan Mossin," which Vickers recognizes as "an excellent exposition of the equilibrium theory of financial asset prices" (1978, p. 104, n. 1). His dissent from the mainstream is rooted in the unavoidable implications of false trading and disequilibrium conditions for the markets of the real world. Vickers is thus prepared to scuttle assumptions so essential to the mainstream that they hardly seem to know how to proceed without them. This is a daring intellectual adventure. Intellectual heretics do not, in general, fare well, as Vickers himself perceptively recognized when he concluded his review article of Steuart's Principles with the observation that "it did not exert a large influence on theoretical work in economics in the decades following its publication" (1970b, p. 1194). He attributed Steuart's failure to influence the classicals to the fact that "his objectives and methods... were very different from those of the utilitarian econom- ics of the century that followed" (1970, p. 1194). Vickers' own objectives and methods are also "different."' Yet, despite</page><page sequence="8">BEYOND "STUDIES IN THE THEORY OF MONEY" 221 his differences from the mainstream, his work is already having a discern- ible influence that reaches well beyond the micro-financial theory of the firm, which is the focus of his main recent work (cf. Katzner, 1986). Vickers insists (along with Keynes, Shackle, and most other post Key- nesians) that uncertainty precludes prediction and that no coherent model, whether macro-econometric or not, can capture the uniqueness of partic- ular historical episodes. This riles against the heuristic of the profession, that theoretical models acquire meaning only in terms of properly speci- fied stochastic models from which a set of values can be identified. Building on George Shackle's model of decision-making under condi- tions of ignorance, Vickers has given direction toward a more enlightened empiricism by pioneering the notion that what decision-makers confront are potential surprises and possibilities, rather than the statistical proba- bilities so dear to econometricians. Like Marshall, Vickers' search has been for an organon or engine for the discovery of truth, in this case the truth about the process of decision-making in the real world of uncertainty that moves in historic time. Based on his perception of the theory of financial markets and the financial theory of the firm as the chief strong- hold of neoclassical orthodoxy, it was here that he mounted his sharpest attack (1978, p. 124). This led, in turn, to his "standardized focus decision criterion," which avoids completely any reliance on the assignment of probabilities to alternative outcomes. The relations between the standard- ized focus outcomes then become embodied in a decision map-a con- struct that not only precludes any neat econometric packaging, but also challenges the profession methodologically to rethink its perception of statistical prediction as the hallmark of economic science. It requires econometricians to eschew the now conventional general equilibrium methodology for doing economic research. This is, indeed, an intellectual heresy of even greater magnitude than was his Keynesian interpretation of the pre-classical monetary theorists thirty years ago, for it challenges the very foundations of the mainstream paradigm. But Vickers is far more than a critic; he is also an intellectual innovator who has fashioned new constructs to facilitate the discovery of further truths, which, through the power of his pen and the persuasiveness of his spoken words, have given conceptual direction to important new work (cf. Bausor, 1984; Katzner, 1986; Rima, 1988). While he generously credits their inspiration to George Shackle, it is no exaggeration to credit Vickers himself for being sufficiently perceptive to seize upon Shackle's insights and intuitions and endow them with the precision that is neces- sary to move our science forward. This is surely the highest achievement</page><page sequence="9">222 JOURNAL OF POST KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS to which an intellectual historian can aspire. Vickers' enduring legacy to economics is that, having become steeped in the monetary theories of pre-classical thinkers, he was able, as a mature scholar, to confront the contemporary knowledge base of his discipline and ferret out precisely those intellectual concepts and constructs that would best serve as building blocks for his own robust contribution to economics as an intellectual discipline.
