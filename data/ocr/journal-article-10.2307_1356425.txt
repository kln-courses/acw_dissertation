E. Wright, Shechem (New York, 1965), pp. 109-110. The finds are there termed Yarmukian, but the writer's authority for the discovery of Wadi Rabah material at Shechem derives mainly from the sherds found in the same stratum on the rock and shown to him by Professor Wright in 1965. The writer here records his thanks to the above- mentioned excavators for their kindness in showing him their material, but the identification of Wadi Rabah pottery in those strata is the writer's exclusive responsibility. g) In addition to the above sites, the writer believes that Wadi Rabah finds also exist in the cave of Umm-Qatafah in the Judaean Desert, dug in the 'thirties by R. Neuville and A. Mallon. This view is based on a typical Wadi Rabah sherd published by the excavators together with Chalcolithic Ghassulian finds, see Syria 12 (1931), p. 41; P1. XIX: 19. Another unpublished sherd from Umm-Qatafah examined by the writer in 1965, is now in the Museum of the Prehistoric Depart- ment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which contains the collections of Neuville. SWe cite here Mayerhoff's account of the neighborhood and the sites from which the material was collected: "The area investigated embraced the fringes of the Mountains of Menasseh in the vicinity of Kibbutz ha-Zorea from Wadi Milh on the west along a distance of four kilometres on both sides of the road leading from Haifa to Megiddo. This neighbourhood is rich in springs flowing into the Qishon. Here ran the ancient highway leading from Phoenicia through the Plain of Acre to the branches of the Via Maritima which crosses the Plain of Esdraelon from south to north. It is not surprising, therefore, that many prehistoric settlements arose in the area and that fortified towns such as Yoqne'an and Megiddo were later founded there, as well as the towns the remains of which are hidden in Tell Abu Zureiq, Abu-Shusha, and elsewhere. The following are the sites at which Wadi Rabah finds have been made: Site 1-near Tell Qamun (Yoqne'am). Site 2A- the small tell known as Tell Qira. Site 2B-near Beth Wilfrid, Kibbutz ha-Zorea. Site 3A-'Ein el Jarba. Site 3B-Tell Abu Zureiq." 8 The exact siting of the area on the 1: 20,000 map of Israel is 162-227. 4</page><page sequence="4">Number 194 April, 1969 constitutes a considerable potential contribution to our knowledge of the Chalcolithic age of this country.4 THE EXCAVATIONS The archaeological excavations at 'Ein el Jarba were carried out in July 1966, after a drainage channel had been cut across the site in November 1965, by a mechanical navvy. As a result of this cut, many finds of the Wadi Rabah culture were brought to the surface. The material included fragments of a unique hole-mouth jar, decorated with designs in applique representing two human figures. Parts of the vessel were later found in situ (Fig. 3: J) and the rest in the spoil-earth taken from the channel. The July excavations covered 70 square meters, the center of the area being the depression which contained the fragments of the vessel. As work proceeded on both sides of the central part of the drainage channel, it soon became clear that a large number of remains in a good state were still concealed in the soil and that most of the damage caused by the navvy affected the middle of the channel (Fig. 2). The excavations distinguished four phases of occupation, all of the Chalcolithic period. Their order from top to bottom was as follows: Phase I. The remains of this phase had been more damaged than the rest due to their proximity to ground-level. There remained part of a small plaster floor with burnt surface (Fig. 3: 1) .5 There also remained here and there on the surface scattered stones, probably the remains of walls from which most of the stones had been robbed at a later, probably post-Chalcolithic period (these blocks are not marked on the plan of the excavated area). Phase II. Two plaster floors remained of this phase, their surface burnt as in Phase I (3: 2-3). Although one floor partly overlaps the other, there is no interval between them and it is probable that they were not divided by any considerable space of time and they appear to be con- temporary. Fragments of walls 4-6 (P1. VI: 1) also belong to Phase II. It may be assumed that these three walls formed part of one structure (Fig. 3). Phase III. Plaster floor 7 (P1. II: 1) and portions of walls 8-9, also presumably belonging to one structure, pertain to this phase (Fig. 3). Phase IV. Remains of this phase were found on virgin soil; they com- prise wall-fragments 10-11, the secondary burial 12 (P1. III: 1) which included the remains of five human crania, plaster floor 13 (P1. II: 2), wall fragments 14, hearth 15, and seven pits dug in the virgin soil (Fig. 3: 16-22). It should be noted that the fragments of the hole-mouth jar ' See BASOR 159 (1960), pp. 32-33, 36. 5 These platforms were probably used for baking bread after they had been heated; such bread was made in the form of thin leaves of dough pressed down onto the heated areas, a practice still prevalent in the Orient. Similar platforms but of flat wadi-bed stones were found at Ghassul, see Ghassul I, p. 37, and also "circular floor" in Stratum VIII at Jericho (Jericho 1935, p. 164, P1. XLVIII: c). A similar method of baking bread but in dome-shaped ovens, is known from prehistoric Assyria, see Arpachiyah, p. 14. 5</page><page sequence="5">0 Vj ?T DIA .3 0 9-G - z t ,, o- LLLL \S Ko 9  8I ./.,1I ....

It is also worth adding that the area between the upper level of walls 11 and 12 and the bottom of floor 1, where the rise is 60-70 cm., was covered by a layer of soil mixed with ash, potsherds, animal bones, flint and bone implements. It seems likely that the area between the two walls, including the area of burial 12, was used as a cooking and roasting place for a fairly prolonged period subsequent to the interment, but it is not clear whether these activities took place in connection with the burials or were carried out independently of them. THE POTTERY An examination of the material of the four phases of occupation shows that there are hardly any differences between the pottery of the four phases; all these pottery-phases belong to one culture, to wit, that of Wadi Rabah as known up till now. Consequently there seems no point in attempting to present the material found in accordance with the occupation-phases as distinguished chiefly by means of the building remains, whith probably approximate one another in date; 6 hence only individual items will be noted as belonging to one phase or the other. Ware. The commonest ware of 'Ein el Jarba is bright red like that of Wadi Rabah.7 In addition there occurs here buff ware and one isolated sherd of " cream ware "; 8 but the fabric peculiar to "Ein el Jarba, as to Wadi Rabah ware in general, is the black burnished material. The black is of the " ivory black " shade.9 This and similar shades on the Wadi Rabah vessels, were created in the kiln after the pots had first been painted red and burnished prior to firing.10 However, the black does not always appear equally over the entire surface: on portions of the vessel appears a dark color which is transitional from red to black, while other parts are left red. Forms Jars. No complete jars were found, nor were sufficient fragments re- covered to enable full restoration; hence the description will be as far as possible based on the rims or on some other method. The typical jar of which fragments were found in great numbers in all four phases, is the bow-rim jar (Figs. 4: 10-11; 5: 5). The rim was first recognized in this country at Jericho (Stratum VIII) and subsequently also in Ken- * This view is strengthened by the plaster floors similar in form revealed in all four layers. 7 Wadi Rabah, p. 154. 8 On the Chalcolithic "cream ware" found in this country and its connection with the Halafian material, see G. Ernest Wright, The Poetry of Palestine from the Earliest Times to the Early Bronze Age (New Haven, 1937), pp. 21-23, 30; Ruth Amiran, "The Cream Ware of Gezer and Beersheba Late Chalcolithic," IEJ 5 (1955), pp. 240-245. For a different opinion on this pottery see MI. E. L. Mallowan, "The Excavations at Tell Chagar Bazar," Iraq 3 (1936), p. 51. 9 For an example of this color, see Halaf, P1.

The rim is common at Tell Halaf.3 It is to be noted that fragments of the shoulder of a bow-rim jar like that found at Jericho VIII and bearing incised horizontal band decorations with herringbone design, were found at 'Ein el Jarba Phase I. Other parts of a vessel of this sort were discovered during the survey of Site 3B (Fig. 5: 5). Another rim is a high everted collar-rim (Figs. 4: 14; 6: 7); this too is common at Jericho VIII, at Teluliyot Batashi, Ghassul 14 and Tell Halaf.15 Common here too is a low collar-rim (Fig. 4: 12), known also at Ghassil and Beer- sheba 16 and frequent at Halaf.17 The out-turned rim (Fig. 4: 13) is also known at these sites." An innovation in the Wadi Rabah repertoire is the vessel with twin rims of which the upper part only was discovered in Phase II (Fig. 6: 4). Similar vessels are known at Halaf and at Tepe Gawra.19 Another interesting vessel is the jar of which the middle part only was found near burial 12 (Phase IV); the part discovered probably belonged to a complete jar placed as a funerary offering near the bones of the dead (Fig. 9: 1; P1. IV: 1). The ware is brown and a dark red decoration in the form of concentric semi-circles is painted on the upper convex por- tion. The pattern contains three and four semi-circles alternately drawn round the surface of the vessel. The lower part is shaped like a flower- pot with slightly concave walls, and in contrast to the upper part, is burnished a dark red, transitional from red to black. At the line of junction between the two parts are two lug-handles. An exact parallel to this vessel has not been found, but its general form, details of manu- 11 See Jericho 1936, p. 85, Pls. XXXII: 21; XXXIII: 18; K. M. Kenyon, Archae- ology in the Holy Land (London, 1965), pp. 63ff., Fig. 5: 1-2, 4. But the writer has his reservations concerning the inclusion of these rims in the category identified by Kenyon with the Yarmukian culture, as he has not changed his views with regard to Stratum VIII at Jericho and Kenyon's parallel Neolithic Pottery B, a view expressed by him in 1959 (BASOR 156, pp. 21-22), namely, that there is no typological connection between Jericho VIII and the Yarmukian culture, and this applies also to the bow-rim which scholars use as one of the criteria in this matter, sometimes without troubling to find out whether Stekelis really noted this rim among finds at Sha'ar ha-Golan. 12 See Wadi Rabah, Fig. 5: 8-9; Batashi, Fig. 10: 13.

We shall continue to look chiefly to Halaf for parallels to the 'Ein el Jarba material, since the largest accumulation of pottery which shows a relationship to the Chalcolithic pottery of Israel has been found there. Only when necessary shall we refer to other sites where Halafian influence has been detected. On such sites excavated in northern Syria, Syro- Cilicia and northern Mesopotamia, see P. J.

Only rim-fragments of these were recovered, most of them known from Wadi Rabah and sites where finds of a similar nature have been made. (The discussion of the hole-mouth jar with applied designs will appear at the end of the section on pottery.) The commonest type has a slightly thickened rim, sometimes rounded (Fig. 6: 8) and sometimes flat and sloping inward; it occasionally has a broad red band painted on it.21 A frequent type at 'Ein el Jarba is a vessel of yellowish-buff ware; the inner surface is blackish; this color continues over the outside of the rim in the form of a band (Fig. 6: 8).22 The two basic shapes of the Chalcolithic hole-mouth jar, wherever they survive complete, chiefly at Ghassul and Beersheba (i. e., the spherical and ovoid), are in effect also the basic forms of the cooking pot at Halaf.23 Pithoi. The characteristic rim is thickened and flat. The wall is verti- cal or slopes inward slightly (Figs. 6: 5; 7: 2) .24 Frequently, below the rims, decoration occurs in the form of a short strip of clay attached to the wall (Fig. 7: 2); this decoration differs from the pithoi at Wadi Rabah, below the rims of which there are ledge-shaped lugs.25 Small Bowls. Numerous fragments of small bowls were found (Fig. 4: 1-9),26 most of them red-burnished or glossy black; the rims are slightly turned in, upright or everted. Most of the small bowls have parallels at Halaf, but the red-burnished carinated bowls are also paralleled at Jericho VIII.27 20 Cf. a kindred form, Halaf, P1. XVI: 2, semi-circular decoration, P1.

It is especially common in the Badarian culture, see Flinders Petrie, Diospolis Parva (London, 1901), p. 13, Pls. 1-11. 28 Ghassul, I, Fig. 46; II, Pl. 77: 5; Beersheba, Figs. 2: 11; 3: 11; Halaf, p. 28. 2" Wadi Rabah, Fig. 5: 1-3; Jericho 1936, P1.

Cf. G. 3runton and 12</page><page sequence="12">Number 194 April, 1969 Bowls. We may first indicate three interesting bowls found during the archaeological survey. One has a thick wall and everted rim bent at approximately 450 (Fig. 5: 1). This type of bowl is found at Wadi Rabah and is common at Halaf.28 The second specimen is a rounded bowl with a sharp, almost upright rim (Fig. 5: 2), painted dark red on both sides. A few fragments of this type of bowl were also found at 'Ein el Jarba and at Kfar Gil'adi; it is also present at Halaf.29 The third is a deep bowl with a slightly everted collar-rim (Fig. 5: 4). On each side of the line of division between the shoulder and neck are red painted bands.30 Notable from the 'Ein el Jarba excavations are three bowl frag- ments, one of an open bowl having a slightly thickened rim with pro- jecting ribs below it; traces of red paint can be discerned (Fig. 5: 3; P1. IV: 11) .31 The second has an inverted rim and is red-burnished on both sides (Fig. 7: 3) 32 The third bowl has a steep, slightly inverted wall. This type is known at Halaf and is common at Arpachiyah (Fig. 4: 15).33 Cornets, Goblets, and Incense-Burners. One fragment of a cornet was recovered (Fig. 6: 2); it is decorated in red paint and has plastic orna- mentation in the form of a small grooved strip attached below the vessel's rim (P1. III: 6). The sherd may belong to the upper part of a cornet known from Ghassulian sites and also paralleled at Halaf.4 A goblet fragment (Fig. 6: 1) of the sort known also at Ghassulian sites and at Halaf should be mentioned.35 The incense-burners were repre- sented chiefly by fragments of cylindrical stands broadening outward at the end (Fig. 4: 16).3" Varia. It has already been mentioned that a fragment of " cream- ware " was found (size 32 mm; P1. III: 5). It is burnished and decorated with a pattern of parallel lines burnished a glossy black.7 Decoration in this color is alien to Chalcolithic pottery in this country. It is also relevant to add that a sherd of the " polychrome ware" category, with linear decoration in two colors, dull black and red, was recovered by Caton-Thompson, The Badarian Civilization and the Pre-Dynastic Remains near Iadari (London, 1928), P1.

These two sherds belong to Halafian or to imported post- Halafian wares, thus constituting the first evidence for the import of such pottery into the country.38 Decoration Excluding paint-wash and burnishing, we may divide the decoration of the pottery at 'Ein el-Jarba into three types: (1) Incision and impres- sion; (2) Painting; (3) Plastic. The decoration of the first category is of a wide variety and includes herringbone designs in one row or in contingent parallel horizontal rows (Figs. 8: 2-3; 5: 5; P1. IV: 5) .9 It comprises combing which forms parallel straight or curvilinear designs, wavy lines, chevrons and cross- hatchings (Fig. 8: 6-10, 12, 15-16; P1. IV: 7-8); 40 also short horizontal or oblique lines (Fig. 8: 1),41 impressed dots (Fig. 8: 4-11; P1. IV: 6),42 nail or thumb impressions, knife-slashes (Figs. 6: 2-3; 8: 13; P1. IV: 3, 9) 43 and rows of short horizontal or vertical curved scratches (Figs. 6: 5; 8: 14). Of all these examples, the thumb decoration, knife-slashing, impressed dots and nail impressions are found at Halaf or on Halafian sites.44 Painted decoration is found on a number of pot-sherds; the designs were executed in red or in a brown-red color, burnished to a dull or glossy finish; the designs consist chiefly of cross-hatching between bands, lozenges, semi-circles (Figs. 6: 6; 9: 1, 4, 6; P1. IV: 1, 10, 14) and in one case a beam-like pattern (Fig. 9: 5). At Wadi Rabah itself and in Jericho VIII, painted ornamentation was not found, but two samples occur in Stratum III at Teluliyot Batashi, the stratum corre- sponding to Wadi Rabah.45 At Ghassul, painted designs are known, but without burnishing, which was not customary here.6 On the other hand Halaf is the richest source for painted designs.47 Plastic ornamen- 38 Until the discovery at Kfar Gil'adi the author believed that the expansion of the original Halafian pottery did not reach this country, see BASOR 159, p. 32; Ugaritica, IV, p. 178. 9 Wadi Rabah.

This decoration is absent at Halaf, but is found at Tepe Gawra in Stratum XIII, see Tepe Gawra, II, Pl. CXXXI: 217. It appears to originate from Hassuna, although it is not clear when it reached this country, see Hassuna, Figs. 13: 1-2, 4, 6, 14; 15: 12. It may be remarked that the decoration is also frequent in the Egyptian Badarian culture; see IEJ 9 (1959), p). 136, and in this writer's view there is no connection between this decoration of the Chalcolithic period and the incised herringbone motifs characteristic of the Yarmukian culture, see BASOR 156, pp. 19-20. 40 Wadi Rabah, Fig. 6: 5-14, 16-17; Batashi, Fig. 10: 15, 19, 21, 22, 26; Jericho 1936, p. 89.

Some sherds may be distinguished, to which thumb-indented clay strips are attached, often representing snakes in appliqu6 (Pls. III: 7; IV: 2-3) .48 The Hole-mouth Jar with Applique Decoration As mentioned above, fragments of this interesting vessel were recovered from the depression in Area J (Fig. 7: 1; P1. I). It should be added that a human jawbone was found nearby, and one meter to the south of the depression the writer discovered human bones and bone and flint tools. It may therefore be assumed that human bones had also been deposited in Area J and along wall 11 as in the case of burial 12. Hence it is probable that the hole-mouth jar had also been deposited to accompany a burial. The height of the vessel is 27 cm., its maximum diameter 23 cm., and it is built up in two parts dissimilar in size and form, the lower occupying about one third of the total height of the vessel, resembling a flowerpot-shaped Ghassulian bowl, while the upper, with convex wall, is shaped like a hole-mouth jar (Fig. 7: 1) .4 The ware is reddish-brown, and the surface burnished brown-red on the upper part and blackish- brown below. On both sides of the upper part of the jar, there are two almost identical figures ("a " and "b "), representing a man with an animal's head; o50 the figures' hands are spread out and turned upwards,5' the legs are placed astride and between the loins appears a projection apparently indicating the male member.

LXV: 8. A closer parallel is found in Egypt in the Badarian culture. Here a group of hole-mouth jars was found, one of which, 20 cm. high, was very similar to the el Jarba vessel. See Mostagedda, P1. XII: 40-42. A hole-mouth type slightly different to that from el Jarba is also found at Hassuna, cf. Hassuna, Fig. 6: 1, 7. 50 Human figurines with heads like those of animals (or heads wearing masks like animal-heads), are known in the el Ubaid culture. These figurines, with heads resembling those of reptiles are known as "fertility statuettes "; it is thought that fear-inspiring monster statuettes of this type also symbolized " life " or "fertility," see e.g. B. L. Goff, Symbols of Prehistoric Mesopotamia (New Haven, 1963), p. 40. Figs. 218-220. Masked fertility figurines are known in this country in the Yar- mukian culture, the first of its type having been discovered by the writer in Tel Aviv in 1950, see J. Kaplan, The Archaeology and History of Tel Aviv-Jaffa (Ramat Gan, 1959), P1. 1 (Hebrew); other figurines of this type have been found at Sha'ar ha-Golan and Munhata, see M. Stekelis, The Yarmukian Culture (Sha'ar ha-Golan, 1966), Pls. 51: 3; 68 (Hebrew). 51 Representations of human figures with raised hands are frequent in prehistoric art, especially in instances of dance-representations connected with cults and hunting. The attempted restoration of the coloured wall-decorations found at Ghassul by Phre H. Vincent, is notable among finds in this country, see RB 42 (1935), p. 101, fig. 17. Drawings on potsherds of human figures with raised hands are known from Halaf and Tepe Gawra, see Halaf, P1. LX: 1-4; Tepe Gawra, II, p. 135, Pl.

The ear appears to be marked by a small area projecting from the head on the right, whereas the grooved projection visible at the center of the head to indicate a down- ward curving horn; hence the head is probably that of a ram. The ram's head and the bull's head are, as is well known, common among the decorations at Halaf.53 The nearest parallel to the design from el Jarba is found on the painted bowl-fragment from Tepe Gawra disclosed in Stratum XVII.54 Here the dancing figure is in an ithyphallic state and the ends of the skirt are shown away from the body (this last detail is not seen on the el Jarba figure, perhaps because the lower part of the figure is given en-face). These two dancing representations from el Jarba and Tepe Gawra are perhaps the prototype of a prehistoric fertility cult turning on the renewal of youth, the bringing of rain or the like. Another interesting parallel is known from Egypt in the Badarian culture; here too a fragment of a bowl, as at el Jarba, bears in applique technique a figure with hands spread out and turned upwards while a long tail descends and winds between the legs.55 Perhaps we have here a prototype of the Egyptian cult ceremony known later as the sed- festival, at which the leader or king danced clad in a kilt of skin from which trailed a bull's tail.56 Such fertility cults are still practiced today, and Henri Frankfort describes an interesting account of such a custom still followed in Kurdistan.57 Reverting to the two figures from el Jarba, it may be concluded that their symbolic significance is "fertility " or "life." However, an apotropaic purpose may also have been intended, that is, to protect the dead from spirits and injurious elements in the same way as do the schematic human figures found on the crown of the ossuaries of the Ghassulian period.58 STONE IMPLEMENTS 59 Most of the stone implements from el Jarba are made of flint, and a few of other hard stones.

Chopping Tools. Few tools from hardstone have been published in this country to date.6' They constitute however, the majority of the chopping implements found in Chalcolithic strata in excavations conducted in Syria, Mesopotamia and Anatolia.62 They are no less common in Egypt.63 Two tools of interest were found in the spoil-earth after the digging of the drainage channel, one a trapezoidal axe polished all over and made of green stone, with an oblong section (Fig. 10: 2); ~4 the other of brown stone with dark veins, elongated, with an elliptical section (Fig. 10: 5); the marks of flaking on part of its sides were made before the final polishing. Three of the tools found in the excavations are worth remarking upon: an axe of whitish stone of nearly lentoid section, with a semi-circular cutting edge (Fig. 10: 3; P1. V: 6); 5 part of the scars visible upon it remain from the chipping executed before the general polishing. The second axe is of bluish stone, of oblong section with slightly rounded ends and polished all over (Fig. 10: 1; P1. VI: 3). A small gouge of whitish stone was also found on which signs of all-round polishing were discernible (Fig. 10: 4; Pl. VI: 2). The flint chopping tools are made of wadi-borne material. The dis- tinguishing feature of these tools is undoubtedly the method of working their cutting edges by flaking parallel with the long axis of the imple- ment, from the under to the upper side, like the working of the chopping tools at Ghassul."6 Most of the cutting edges of the axes and hatchets report the account was restricted to a minimum; this shortcoming, at any rate, will now be made good by the material from el Jarba. 0 Obsidian was imported, apparently from Anatolia, as early as the pre-pottery Neolithic period and has been discovered in small quantities on the Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites of this country, except the Negev. The find of a lump of raw material is known from a Chalcolithic site in western Galilee, see M. Stekelis, "An Obsidian Core Found at Kibbutz Kabri," Eretz-Israel 5 (1958), p. 85 f. Obsidian was widely used in Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Syria, and decreases in proportion as the sites are further from the sources, which are mainly in the north-east of Anatolia. At Halaf, a considerable part of the stone tools are of obsidian, see Halaf, p. 107 f., Pls. CIX-CX. 61 Ghassul, I, P1. 27: 7; E. Macdonald et al., Beth Pelet, II (London, 1932), Pls.

The axe from el Jarba may therefore belong to the burials found in the lower occupation layer. In prehistoric Egypt the stone axes were used as amulets, see C. Caton-Thompson and E. W. Gardner, The Desert Fayum (London, 1934), p. 82 f., Pl. XXXIII: 12. In Sudan they are still used as "rainstones," see C. G.

V: 7-8); the cutting edge of the gouge which was found to be almost completely defective was also recognizably polished (Fig. 11: 3; P1. VI: 4).67 Picks. A number of items of various sizes belong to this group of tools; they are made of flat flint-nodules and the section of the tool is generally convex-oblong (Fig. 18: 18; P1. VI: 5). Cutting Tools. Some of these were made from axes or hatchets which had gone out of use after their cutting end had been damaged (Fig. 12: 1-9; P1. V: 5); the tool was renewed by retouching one of the long sides which now became the cutting end; the opposite side was blunted and sometimes rounded by additional polishing (Fig. 11: 5). A tool found at 'Amuq in Phase E, appears to have belonged to this class.6 Scrapers. A number of tools should be remarked upon, one resembling the "fan" type (Fig. 12: 4), made of a flake with thick cortex on the upper side. Another tool is made from a flake of which the cortex had been removed (Fig. 192: 3; P1. V: 4).6 Isolated examples of the " end" and " side" scraper types were also found (Fig. 12: 5, 13). Awls and Borers. This group contains a relatively large number of items, two of which are prominent types. To the first belong tools made on a blade or small blade (Fig. 19: 6-8, 14-15; P1. V: 192-14); among the others may be mentioned an awl made from the end of a blade, the part surviving being retouched along the upper part of the sides (Fig. 12: 15). Another tool is made of a thick blade of which the sides were trimmed along their entire length; the remainder constitutes a long crystallized point which was apparently used as a boring tool (Fig. 14: 14) .7o The second class included a large or microlithic flake on one of which sides a point, or sometimes two points, had been made (Fig. 12: 9-12; P1. V: 9-11).71 Sickle Blades. This group included numerous items. Most of the tools are made with trapezoidal section; one side of the blade is delicately denticulated, usually on the upper side of the blade, the ends are trun- cated and the opposite side is retouched steeply or flatly (Fig. 13: 2-4; P1. V: 2-3). Gloss created by use is usually visible on the under side of the blade but sometimes it appears on both sides; an " end " type of blade is also known (Fig. 13: 7). Another type of blade which is com- mon at Wadi Rabah is the tool made of a thick flake, truncated on three sides and more or less a right-angle triangle in section (Fig. 13: 1; Pl. V: 1).72 Blades and Flakes. Most of these blades possess no secondary work- ing, but here and there signs of use are visible (Fig. 18: 6).

The second blade is made of brown flint, and both its sides were retouched along the entire length on the upper face of the tool (Fig. 13: 8). OTHER FINDS Bone Tools. A number of complete points and awls were recovered, all well worked and polished by use (Fig. 14: 2, 7-8) .7 Another tool, fitted into a tubular bone fragment, was used, it would seem, as a spatula or perhaps as a paring instrument (Fig. 14: 3; P1. VI: 6).7 A large knife, one end of which was missing, was also found; it measured 98.6 by 3.3 cm. (Fig. 14: 4) .7 In addition a piece of joint was found, with a punctured perforation, evidently part of a flute or whistle (Fig. 14: 6).76 Spindle-Whorls. Most were made of small circular plaques formed from potsherds. The perforation is usually biconical (Fig. 13: 10, 15) .77 Included is a circular earthenware plaque without perforation, which may have been designed to be perforated as a spindle-whorl, but also may have been used to patch a hole on the upper part of a pottery vessel in a fashion still common in this country. Another specimen is made of serpentine stone (Fig. 13: 11; P1. VI: 12). Weapons. All four levels of occupation yielded sling-stones, most of hard whitish stone, egg-shaped with pointed ends (Fig. 14: 9-12; P1. VI: 7-10),8 but individual spherical examples were found too. The length of the large ovoid sling-stones was 7 cm., and of the smaller 4 cm. The spoil removed from the channel before the excavations also yielded a small baked clay sling-stone 3.7 cm. in size (Fig. 14: 13). A hoard of weapons was discovered in the north-west corner on Phase IV occupation earth. The collection included 17 ovoid and 2 spherical sling-stones, and 2 maceheads of white marble (Fig. 14: 1, 5). One, No. 1, was flatter than usual (P1. VI: 11) .7 The absence of arrow-heads and lance-heads should be noted.80s RADIO-CARBON14 TESTS Two such tests were made, one of charcoal extracted from Pit 19, belonging to occupation Phase IV, the other of animal bones extracted from the vicinity of Area J, also belonging to occupation Phase IV.

The connection of the pottery of Jericho VIII and Ghassul, including the Beersheba sites, with el Jarba, i. e. Wadi Rabah pottery, has been clearly demonstrated. The connection exists between the forms of the vessels and the ornamentation, a considerable part of which, commencing at el-Jarba, continues at Jericho VIII, but dimin- ishes towards Ghassul and the Beersheba sites. As for the flint tools, despite the fact that most of the Jericho VIII material 82 could not be utilized as an intermediate station between el Jarba and Ghassul, the connection of the lithic finds at Ghassul with those of el Jarba is clearly recognizable, and most of the el Jarba types and their technique of working persisted at Ghassul. It should be added that on both sites, el Jarba and Ghassul, arrow and lance-heads are conspicuous by their absence or rarity.8 The remaining finds of other materials such as bone and stone at el Jarba fit into the general picture of the Chalcolithic period in this country. The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that the outline of the ceramic evolution of the Chalcolithic age as recorded by the writer,84 i. e., its development from Wadi Rabah to Jericho VIII and thence to Ghassul, in fact expresses the country's Chalcolithic evolu- tion as a whole. But the contribution of el Jarba can be perceived not only in the information it furnishes on the inner evolution of the Chal- colithic culture; it has also contributed to a clearer recognition of the sources on which it draws: the pottery, the polished stone tools and sling- stones point to the region of north-east Syria and upper Mesopotamia, an area represented chiefly by the variegated material found at Halaf. Elements common to Halaf and el Jarba are numerous, including a considerable number of pottery forms, red and black burnishing, " cream ware," decoration with thumb indentations and nail impressions and with rectilinear designs in paint, as well as the manufacture of hard stone chopping tools and sling-stones. On the other hand, Halaf lacks entirely the incised decoration with herringbone motifs, straight and curvilinear designs so characteristic of the Wadi Rabah-el Jarba orna- mentation, while the Halaf flint industry is poor in developed flint chopping tools, an element characteristic of el Jarba. 81 The obtaining of dates by the radio-carbon analysis of animal bones is much needed, since in this way a substitute for charcoal may be found. 83 See above, n. 59. 83 See above, n. 80. s' BAOR 159, p. 32. 27</page><page sequence="27">I I I O at' ; !

If it is assumed that el Jarba is not the oldest of the Wadi Rabah settlements and that older remains of its type are still hidden in the country's soil, it cannot be supposed that they are much earlier than 4000 B. C. This date corre- sponds to the new date of Stratum IIIC at Ras Shamra, viz. 4183 ?_ 173 B. C. instead of 4582 ?_ 81 B. C.85 On the basis of this new date it may be assumed that Halaf-inspired pottery persisted even somewhat after 4000 B. C. As to Mersin, the writer has already pointed out that the Wadi Rabah pottery corresponds chronologically to Stratum XIX,86 therefore the date of Stratum XIX is also about 4000 B. C.87 When the material from Byblos is checked in the light of finds from el Jarba we find that there exists a considerable amount of similarity between the flint industry of the stratum named " Neolithique Recent" and that of el Jarba." It can therefore be assumed that similar identity must exist between the pottery of these two corresponding sites and that the date of the "Neolithique Recent" of Byblos is also about 4000 B. C. From the most recent reports on the excavations at Munhata (IEJ 16 [1966], pp. 269-271)89 we learn that Stratum II is now divided into two: 2A, corresponding to the Wadi Rabah culture, and 2B, correspond- ing to the Yarmukian.90 These results confirm the view on which the present report is based and which the writer has held since the excava- tions in ha-Bashan Street, Tel Aviv, were concluded in 1952. This view recognized the stratigraphical and cultural difference between Jericho VIII and Wadi Rabah on one hand, and the finds at Sha'ar ha-Golan (the Yarmukian culture) on the other.9 Before concluding it would be well to summarize the entire informa- tion available concerning the el Jarba-Wadi Rabah culture. The bearers of the Wadi Rabah culture appear to have reached the country from the north about 4000 B. C. We seem to have here an immigration of people who had been under the marginal influence of the eastern Halafian civilization and had developed a local pottery tradition based mainly on Halafian forms, but neglected the characteristic Halaf painted decoration and substituted decoration by incised linear patterns. These people reached the country armed with stone weapons-maceheads and sling-stones; they also brought with them a method of pis&amp;-wall con- struction on rubble foundations; their houses were planned with oblong " See H. de Contenson, "A Further Uote on the Chronology of Basal Ras Shamra," BASOR 175 (1964), pp. 47 ff. 86 BASOR 159, p. 36. 7 In this connection one may raise doubts as regards the accepted high date 5000 B. C. for the appearance of the Halaf culture. The writer would rather suggest 4500 B. C. 88 Cf. Jacques Couven, "Les industries lithiques du Tell de Byblos," L'Anthro- pologie, 1962, p. 491 and fig. 4. s For earlier reports see J. Perrot, "Kh. Munhata," IEJ 13 (1963), pp. 138-140; 14 (1964), pp. 108-109; 278-280; 15 (1965), pp. 248-249. s9 The writer has reservations concerning Perrot's comparison of Stratum 2A with Kenyon's PNB, and he also has his doubts concerning the attribution of the fine arrowheads by Perrot to Stratum 2A rather than to 2B below it.

They imported obsidian, stone tools and painted pottery, and their trade seems to have extended as far as Egypt.4 Their custom of burial was secondary, and after the decomposition of the body the bones were collected and interred near their dwellings; interment was accom- panied by the deposition of funerary objects symbolizing " fertility." This brief survey of the Wadi Rabah culture would not be complete without an account, based on our method, of the development of the other phases of the Chalcolithic period, of which Wadi Rabah was the beginning. In Stratum VIII at Jericho there were various signs of the degeneration of the Wadi Rabah culture. Black burnishing had vanished completely from the pottery of this phase, while the red became re- stricted to small bowls; the incised linear decoration decreased and there remained only horizontal bands of herringbone design, though wavy-line decoration appeared here and there. But the principal change in the Chalcolithic culture of the country may be estimated to have taken place about 3500 B. C. At that time begins a large-scale infiltration of shepherds and herdsmen from the north, apparently from south-east Anatolia; this is the beginning of the well-known Ghassulian Phase. The Ghassulians, as we shall term them, overran the entire country, flooding the lowland valleys and the hill country; and in their nomadic search of pasture for their flocks and herds reached the Judaean Desert and the Negev expanses, exploiting every patch of seasonal grass in these semi-arid areas. The Ghassulian culture was, as we have seen, a direct continuation of Wadi Rabah-Jericho VIII, and most of the latter period's pottery forms and stone tools persisted, as did the method of constructing dwellings of oblong rooms on rubble foundations con- nected by open-air court-yards. Where the cult of the dead was con- cerned, secondary interment was also customary at Ghassul. But numer- ous innovations and developments occurring in the Ghassulian Phase emphasize its individuality. This is recognizable in many spheres, more especially in pottery making, which added types of vessels and decora- tion hitherto unknown. The most pronounced expression of the Ghassulian pottery is the churn." 95 This vessel symbolizes the ability of the owners of great flocks and herds to convert the large seasonal quantities of milk at their disposal into permanent animal fat which could be preserved and traded to enrich a man's larder.6 The existence of Ghassulian settlements 1* Cf. Wadi Rabah, fig. 3. * This is probably evidenced by the numerous chopping tools found on sites of the period. 6 In addition to the comparisons made here and there between el Jarba and the Badarian culture, see also in this connection, Kaplan, op. cit., (above, n. 27), p. 136 and also the new date of the Badarian proposed by W. C. Hayes, viz. early fourth millennium B.C. (JNES 23 [1964], p. 273). , J.

VII), may well confirm that the donkey was used for carrying loads by this period. The growing of grain and legumes was an important branch of the Ghassulian economy and necessitated the erection of granaries to store them against years of dearth and drought. Thus developed the com- bination of bell-shaped grain-silos with pits and caves dug for shelters in the ground and interconnected to make subterranean structures. These are especially common in the Negev " and in the south of the country where there prevails an unstable and variable rainfall. The Ghassulian secondary burial rite has many forms; the interments of bones or skeletons have been found lacking in parts apparently lost during primary burial; these were interred in above-ground dwellings or in subterranean structures. But characteristic of the Ghassulian burial is undoubtedly interment in baked clay ossuaries shaped like northern dwelling huts. These appear to have first been deposited in underground storehouses vacated for the purpose, and subsequently in caves specially dug for burial. Thenceforward the custom of cave burial spread through- out all historic periods. About 3300 B. C., the Ghassulian culture came to an end and a brief period of transition began, which led to the Early Bronze Age. The excavations were carried out by the writer on behalf of the Museum of Antiquities of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. The excavator was assisted by Messrs. E. Mayerhoff (Wilfrid House Museum, ha-Zorea), A. Yosef (Museum of Antiquities of Tel Aviv-Jaffa), and Y. Katz ('Ein Gedi). Dr. N. Haas (University of Tel Aviv) was in charge of the anthro- pological material, Mrs. H. Kaplan prepared the drawings and assisted in drafting this report, the photography was done by Mr. N. Suffrin (Tel Aviv) while the radio-carbon tests were carried out by " Geochron " Laboratories, U.S.A. The writer is indebted to Prof. G. E. Wright (Harvard University) for his help in securing the financial means to cover the expenses of the excavations and publication of this report; to Dr. R. Hecht (Dagon Museum, Haifa) for sponsoring the radio- carbon tests, and to Kibbutz ha-Zorea for having kindly lodged the members of the expedition. Even today this fat is still an important food of the bedouin and the fellaheen, known in Arabic as samneh. 9 These Chalcolithic subterranean shelters are also known from Tel Aviv. Here in 1951 the writer discovered one such shelter associated with ossuary burial caves, see Kaplan, op. cit., n. 50, pp. 33-34. 81</page><page sequence="31">Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research BIBLIOGRAPHY W.
