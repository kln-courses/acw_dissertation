<plain_text><page sequence="1">Parley P. Pratt: The Apostle Paul of Mormonism. By Terryl L. Givens and Matthew J. Grow. Oxford University Press, 2011. 499 pages. $34.95. Award-winning authors Terryl L. Givens, the James A. Bostwick Chair of English at the University of Richmond, and Matthew J. Grow, former professor of history at the University of Southern Indiana and currently the director of publications for the LDS Church Historical Department in Salt Lake City, have produced a candid and engaging biographical narrative of Parley P. Pratt (1807-57), an original member of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and one of early Mormonism's most important and influential figures. Born on April 12, 1807, in Burlington, New York, of Puritan stock to Jared Pratt and Charity Dickinson, Parley Parker Pratt became an ardent disciple of Joseph Smith and one of Mormonism's most conspicuous actors. A believer in the Bible and imbued with religious yearnings as a youth, Pratt first came under the influence of Sidney Rigdon, a former Reformed Baptist minister, in 1829 while living in Amherst, Ohio. Rigdon had only recently broken ties with Alexander Campbell and his primitivist movement (Disciples of Christ). Intent on promulgating the faith, in August 1830, Pratt set out to share the gospel message with family members living in Canaan, New York. En route, while passing through Wayne County, he came across a copy of the Book of Mormon. Upon reading the book, Pratt became convinced of the truthfulness of the record and Joseph Smith's calling as translator and prophet. On September I, Pratt was baptized into the Church of Christ (later The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). He remained a lifelong adherent of Mormonism (although he had a brief falling away with Smith in 1837 over a</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 541 failed business dealing), devoting the rest of his life to what he believed was the fullness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Pratt's missionary zeal led to his calling in February 1835 to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the second-highest-ranking ecclesiastical body in the church. In that capacity, he labored for the next twenty-two years, serving no fewer than eleven proselytizing missions for the church—mainly in the eastern United States (primarily New York and, Ontario, Canada), but also Great Britain, California, and Chile. As an apostle, Pratt ably expounded and defended Mormonism in the press—as editor of two Mormon newspapers (the Latter-day Saints' Millennial Star, published in Great Britain; and the Mormon, published in New York City) and as a pamphleteer, book author, essayist, hymnist (he published the first LDS British hymnal in 1840), and poet. His most significant publishing endeavors (in terms of doctrinal expositions) include Voice of Warning (New York: W. Sanford, 1837), which appeared in twelve editions during his lifetime (including French, German, and Danish) and ranks "second only to the Book of Mormon as an instrument of conversion" (119); and Key to the Science of Theology (Liverpool: F.D. Richards, 1855). The authors contend that these two books were "the most influential noncanonical volumes in nineteenth-century Mormonism" (331). In addition to his doctrinal treatises, Pratt completed a full-length autobiographical manuscript, though it did not appear in print until seventeen years after his death (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, New York: Russell Brothers, 1874). The book has been through numerous printings and continues to be widely read, particularly in LDS circles. In short, Pratt's productivity as a writer and author led his biographers to conclude that he was "the most prolific Mormon writer of his age" (114) and "the first theologian of Mormonism" (169). Arguably, however, current Mormon historians and scholars could take issue with these assessments in light of the doctrinal and theological contributions and writings of other early Mormon contemporaries of Pratt, individuals such as Sidney Rigdon, William W. Phelps, and Oliver Cowdery. As a member of Mormonism's ecclesiastical elite, Pratt associated closely with Joseph Smith, who introduced religious teachings and practices not accepted by the mainstream orthodox Christian churches. One of these princi ples was the concept of eternal nature of the family, but more particularly the concept of the union of the sexes in the eternities; namely that a marriage between a husband and a wife could continue into the next life. "It was from him [Joseph Smith]," Pratt wrote, "that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time [earth life] and all eternity; and that the refined sympathies and affections which endeared us to each other emanated from the fountain of divine eternal love. It was from him that I learned that we might cultivate these affections, and grow and increase in the same to all eternity; while the result of our endless union would be an offspring as numer ous as the stars of heaven, or the sands of the sea shore" (174). Additionally, Smith expanded the eternal marriage concept to include the principle of plural</page><page sequence="3">542 Journal of the American Academy of Religion marriage (polygamy), which institution was formally practiced in the church until 1890 when Mormon leaders announced that such marriages would no longer be sanctioned. Pratt fully embraced the concept of polygamy. All told, he had twelve wives and fathered thirty children (not including an adopted Indian child), twenty-three of whom lived to maturity. His posterity numbers in the tens of thousands, including Mormon Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney. Pratt's practice of polygamy, however, eventually cost him his life. In November 1855, he married Eleanor Jane McComb, his last plural wife and the estranged wife of Hector McLean. Hector's alcoholism and violent outrages caused Eleanor to leave a few years after their marriage, but the couple never formally divorced. Eleanor subsequently embraced Mormonism and married the polygamous Pratt, infuriating Hector even more, who threatened to commit her to an insane asylum. Following a series of events surrounding the custody of their three children, McLean, seeking revenge, tracked down and killed Parley near Van Buren, Arkansas, in 1857. As the subtitle of the book implies, the authors identify three similarities or parallels between Pratt and the ancient Christian apostle Paul. Like Paul who sought to preach the Christian religion to both the Jews and the Gentiles throughout the pagan Roman empire, Pratt played a major role in expanding Mormonism throughout the United States, parts of Canada, Great Britain, and Latin America (although his attempt in this last region was unsuccessful). Additionally, Pratt "traveled thousands of miles, braved imprisonment and hardship for the gospel's sake, and gladly suffered the contempt of his contem poraries for his part in 'turning the world upside down' and overthrowing the idols of what he saw as a benighted religious culture" (393). Pratt's "extensive missionary travels," the author's contend, "help put [Mormonism] on the path from small sect to worldwide religion" (7). Second, the authors note that just as Paul's writings "popularized Jesus's teachings" (5), Pratt's theological treatises on Mormon teachings distin guishes him "as the principal expounder and shaper of the doctrines Joseph Smith proclaimed" (395), adding that he "did more than any other man to turn Joseph Smith's prophetic declarations into a full formed new religious system" (393). Some of Smith's teachings that Pratt expounded upon in his writings include the necessary exercise of faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost; the need for ordinances to be performed by proper authority; the manifestation of spiritual gifts (particularly healing) by true believers; the validity of the Bible and the Book of Mormon; the rejection of original sin (Mormons believe that because of the atonement of Christ, humankind is not subject to punishment for Adam's transgression and that infants do not need baptism); the literal gathering of the house of Israel; and the inauguration of the Millennium by Christ's Second Coming. Pratt, however, propounded more unorthodox dogma, including the concept of preembodied spirits, the rejection of ex nihilo creation, the eternal nature of matter, God being subject to law, God as an anthropomorphic being (and later God's actual physicality), eternal marriage, the rationale for plural</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 543 marriage, and eventual human deification. While the authors acknowledge that Pratt clearly learned many unconventional concepts from Joseph Smith, "it is possible that Pratt propounded his highly unorthodox notions to Smith, who later embraced them and confirmed them" (172). Finally, Paul gloried in religious persecution and tribulation (Rom. 5:3), and "distresses for Christ's sake" (2 Cor. 12:10). Likewise, Pratt viewed his public maltreatment (which included an eight-month imprisonment in Missouri's jails) to be like that of the ancient apostle. Furthermore, while Christian tradition holds that Paul suffered martyrdom for the Christian faith, as Pratt lay dying from McLean's violent assault, an eyewitness reported him as saying: "I die ... a firm believer in the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. ... I know that the Gospel is true and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Living God." His last words were, "I am dying a martyr to the faith" (383). The entire Latter-day Saint community con sidered him a martyr as well. Another major contribution of the book is Givens and Grow's chapter on Pratt's relationship with his polygamous wives and the social and family dynamics (i.e., living arrangements, financial matters, division of labor, inter personal relationships among the wives and children, property, etc.) associated with this radical order of marriage (chapter 12). Mormon polygamy is gener ally a hot topic for scholars trying to interpret the theological and historical aspects of the early Latter-day Saint movement, and the authors' examination illustrates to some degree the difficulties associated with those who tried to live the principle. Understandably, some plural marriages failed, including two of Parley's. Soon after the death of his first wife Thankful Halsey, in 1837, Pratt married Mary Ann Frost Stearns, a widow and mother of one daughter. The couple enjoyed genuine marital love and devotion until shortly after Parley began taking additional wives (1843), when the relationship became strained. Mary, who believed and accepted the principle of plural marriage, eventually separated but remained married to Parley until 1853, when the divorce became final. Mary never remarried but remained a committed Latter-day Saint single the rest of her life. Martha Monks, another polygamous wife, became disillu sioned with polygamy and Mormonism and left Parley in 1849, relocating in California. Yet, in spite of his two failed marriages and all the difficulties asso ciated with the practice, Parley did his best to "treat his plural wives on an equal basis" (327). The authors conclude that "his household was generally as happy and harmonious," and as evidence that polygamy was successful—at least in the case of the Pratt family—"most of his adult children, both sons and daughters, entered into polygamous families as well" (330). Givens and Grow should be commended for their scholarship and objec tivity in providing historians and religion scholars with a remarkable narrative that explores in breadth and depth, through the life of Parley Parker Pratt, the historical and religious underpinnings of early Mormonism. doi:10.1093/jaarel/lfs006 Advance Access publication April 23, 2012 Alexander L.
