Their relationship is one of "fundamental opposition," an opposition that constitutes the vitality of western civilization. In Strauss' s reading, to choose between Jerusalem and Athens is to choose between "life in obedience to divine law or life in freedom" Girard, too, recognizes the tension between Athens and Jerusalem, but he does not conceive of it as Strauss does. The question to be considered will be whether or not Strauss' s account of the relationship between Jerusalem and Athens has left him susceptible to Girard's critique of philosophy, particularly his critique of Heidegger. Has Strauss overlooked philosophy's complicity in scapegoating, and its cultural role in hiding the victim from view? Even when he does not speak of it directly, "the Jewish question" is at the center of Leo Strauss's life and work. Born in Germany into an orthodox Jewish family in 1899, he developed an early enthusiasm for political Zionism, as well as a strong interest in Jewish thought, writing on (among others) Maimonides, Spinoza, Moses Mendelssohn, and Hermann Cohen. Later in life, Strauss would observe how, without being aware of it and without rebellion, he had, even at a relatively early stage, drifted far from the religious observance and belief of his parents' home.2 Yet he remained profoundly conscious of his Jewish identity. In part, this was due to his awareness of belonging to a people whose religious, intellectual, and cultural achievements formed one of the two major traditions of Western civilization. But it is difficult to read Strauss without recognizing that he was equally cognizant of the fact that being a Jew made him a member of a historically persecuted minority. As a young German Jew living in the Weimar Republic he was confident that, despite a certain degree of social discrimination, Jews could enjoy security within a liberal democracy. Yet this confidence was not untroubled.

Seeing these victims of persecution with his own eyes, he realized that similar acts of violence might possibly occur in Germany. Even though this experience was soon forgotten and overlaid by pleasant memories of life among his non- Jewish neighbors, Strauss stresses how it still "went to my bones."3 In 1932 he was awarded a Rockefeller Grant to study abroad. With the rise of National Socialism, Strauss decided it would be best not to return to Germany. The young scholar made a wise decision, because apart from his wife and children, all of his remaining relatives perished in Hitler's Germany or were killed after having escaped.4 It is scarcely surprising then, to find Strauss stating, "I believe I can say, without any exaggeration, that since a very, very early time the main theme of my reflections has been what is called the 'Jewish question.'"5 To those who know Strauss primarily as a political philosopher, this assertion may seem somewhat startling. Yet from his perspective, not only is there no conflict between his work as a political philosopher and his engagement with the Jewish question, but the two areas are, in fact, directly connected. He writes in the preface to his book, Spinoza 's Critique of Religion, "From every point of view it looks as if the Jewish people were the chosen people, at least in the sense that the Jewish problem is the most manifest symbol of the human problem insofar as it is a social or political problem."6 With this observation, Strauss is not reducing the Jewish problem to a dilemma capable of being solved on the level of politics. On the contrary, his insight into the fundamental nature of the Jewish problem stems from his realization that any purely political solution to the problem is inadequate. For Strauss, liberal democracy at its best is able to limit public, legal, and governmental discrimination against Jews and other minorities. But a liberal state cannot prevent private, social discrimination without intruding into the lives of its citizens in a way that contradicts its own commitment to freedom.7 In similar fashion, as sympathetic as he is to Zionism, Strauss views the 3Leo Strauss, "Why We Remain Jews," in Jewish Philosophy , p. 313. 4Kenneth Hart Green, "Editor's Introduction," in Jewish Philosophy , p. 3-5. 5"Why We Remain Jews," p. 3 1 2. Given Strauss's explicit statements concerning the impact that his Jewish identity had in determining the direction his work took, it is difficult to fathom how one of his most notable students could make the following observations about him: "The story of a life in which the only real events were thoughts is easily told. . . . There is nothing in his biography that explains his thought, but it is to be noted that he was born a Jew in that country where Jews cherished the greatest secular hopes and suffered the most terrible persecutions. . ."

Likewise, he sees the creation of a Jewish state as a positive and necessary step, but it is a solution to the Jewish question that remains within the horizon set by the underlying assumptions of liberal democracy. While such an attempted solution is understandable, it avoids the most important issue of all - that the Jewish problem epitomizes the human problem because it pointedly raises the theological-political question: The foundation, the authoritative layer, of the Jewish heritage presents itelf, not as a product of the human mind, but as a divine gift, as a divine revelation. . . . When cultural Zionism understands itself, it turns into religious Zionism. But when religious Zionism understands itself, it is in the first place Jewish faith and only secondarily Zionism. It must regard as blasphemous the notion of ahuman solution to the Jewish problem.8 In Strauss's view, one could not adequately understand the Jewish question as a social and political matter without considering the claims of biblical revelation. Regard- less of where one stands in relation to these claims (and Strauss's own position is not without its ambiguities), it is impossible to avoid them. The Jewish problem symbolizes the human problem as it has been formulated in western civilization. Western civili- zation cannot be understood apart from the biblical heritage. But the Bible is not the only source of western culture. The other pillar of the western tradition is the heritage of classical Greece. Whoever wishes to consider human affairs at the deepest possible level must come to terms with both Jerusalem and Athens: All the hopes that we entertain in the midst of the confusions and dangers of the present are founded positively or negatively, directly or indirectly on the experiences of the past. Of these experiences the broadest and deepest, as far as we Western men are concerned, are indicated by the names of the two cities Jerusalem and Athens. ... In order to understand ourselves and to illuminate our trackless way into the future, we must understand Jerusalem and Athens.9 The purpose of these introductory remarks is to suggest a relationship between Strauss's lifelong reflection on the Jewish question and the centrality of the theme of "Jerusalem and Athens."10 1 would maintain that Strauss's work as a philosopher should not be separated from his experience as a German Jew, conscious of the precarious existence of his people during his own lifetime and throughout history. In other words, Leo Strauss is acutely aware of the reality of victimization, and this awareness provides 8"Preface to Spinoza 's Critique of Religion ," p. 143. 9Leo Strauss, "Jerusalem and Athens: Some Preliminary Reflections," in Susan Orr, Jerusalem and Athens : Reason and Revelation in the Works of Leo Strauss (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 1995), p. 179. 10"The issue of traditional Judaism versus philosophy is identical with the issue of Jerusalem versus Athens" (Leo Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952], p. 20).</page><page sequence="4">88 SHOFAR Winter 2004 Vol. 22, No. 2 a backdrop for much of his writing. 1 1 This raises the possibility of an encounter between Strauss's thought and that of Rene Girard, whose illuminating understanding of the role of victimization in culture is widely recognized. Athens and Jerusalem If the question of the relationship between Jerusalem and Athens is inescapable, so is the problem that attends it. Nowhere does Strauss speak about Jerusalem and Athens with greater clarity than in the following passage: Western civilization consists of two elements, has two roots, which are in radical disagree- ment with each other. We may call these elements, as I have done elsewhere, Jerusalem and Athens, or to speak in nonmetaphorical language, the Bible and Greek philosophy.12 In other places, Strauss describes the relationship as one of "conflict," "antagonism," "fundamental tension," or "fundamental opposition." Jerusalem and Athens stand for "opposite" and "incompatible" claims.13 At the basis of western culture we find conflict. The opposition between Athens and Jerusalem is not, however, to be viewed negatively; rather "we must be aware of the fact that the vitality and the glory of our Western tradition are inseparable from its problematic character."14 For Strauss, the conflict between the two cities gives life to the West: The recognition of two conflicting roots of Western civilization is, at first, a very disconcerting observation. Yet this realization has also something assuring and comforting about it. The very life of Western civilization is the life between two codes, a fundamental tension. There is, therefore, no reason inherent in Western civilization itself, in its fundamental constitution, why it should give up life. But this comforting thought is justified only if we live that life, if we live that conflict. 1 !I believe there is ample support for this interpretation of Strauss. One of his most important and characteristic books, Persecution and the Art of Writing, deals with the theme of how authors convey the socially disruptive truth of their message in a way that protects them from persecution. Strauss's famous (even notorious) distinction between exoteric and esoteric teaching is very much tied to a context in which people must be careful about what they write for fear of punishment. Even in works in which he does not focus explicitly on persecution; there is often an undercurrent of concern about the threat posed to individuals and minorities by the majority. 12Leo Strauss, "Progress or Return?

Both traditions address with the utmost seriousness the question of the divine law.16 More specifically, both recognize the problem of divine law to be of central importance. From this common ground, the Bible and Greek philosophy will move in sharply diverging directions. To understand these differences it is necessary to clarify the precise nature of the problem of divine law. Strauss approaches the issue by noting how all societies appear to operate with some notion of "custom" or "way" rooted in the observation "that things behave in a regular manner, that they have customs of behaving and ways of behaving." Which way is correct? "Our way," of course, where "our" refers to whichever group one happens to belong to. The way of the community is correct because it has always been so; originally the good is identified with the ancestral: The ancestors are superior, and therefore the ancestors must be understood, if this notion is fully thought through, as gods, or sons of gods, or pupils of gods. In other words, it is necessary to consider the "right way" as the divine law, theos nomos}1 The problem of divine law arises not only from the multiplicity of divine codes, but also from their contradictory assertions on the most important matters. Confronted with this difficulty, Athens and Jerusalem offer alternatives that, according to Strauss, are fundamentally at odds. Given a variety of conflicting divine codes, the notion that the law is divine because it is ancestral begins to be questioned. What, then, could be the ultimate source and ground of the law? This leads to the more fundamental question of humanity's place within the cosmos. In answering these questions, the Bible and Greek philosophy arrive at significantly different conclusions. The Greeks proceed on the basis of inquiry. To obtain knowledge of the "first things" it is necessary to begin by observing that which is accessible to all human beings, and by means of further questions and demonstration, to comprehend something of the order of things. In the course of this process, the authority of divine law is diminished: Because the quest for the beginning, for the first things, becomes now philosophic or scientific analysis of the cosmos, the place of the divine law, in the traditional sense of the term (where it is a code traced to a personal god), is replaced by a natural order which may even be called, as it was later to be called, a natural law - or at any rate, to use a wider term, 15"Progress or Return," pp. 1 16, 121. 16"Progress or Return," p. 107. 17"Progress or Return," p. 1 1 1-1 12. See also Natural Right and History , pp. 82-86.</page><page sequence="6">90 SHOFAR Winter 2004 Vol. 22, No. 2 a natural morality. So the divine law, in the real and strict sense of the term, is only the starting point, the absolutely essential starting point for Greek philosophy, but it is abandoned in the process.18 This insight is critical if we would understand Strauss's conception of philosophy - the philosophical life originates in a questioning of divine law and of those authorities that support it. By contrast, the Bible adheres to a particular divine law, and insists that this law alone is true. All other codes are false, human inventions. This acceptance of one code as uniquely divine does not allow for independent questioning in the manner of philos- ophy. The biblical authors were wise enough to understand the implications of their claims, and with bold consistency they drew out the consequences of their assertions: How has one to conceive of the whole if one particular, and therefore contingent, law of one particular, contingenttribe is to be the divine law? The answer is: it must be a personal God; the first cause must be God; He must be omnipotent, not controlled and not controllable. But to be knowable means to be controllable, and therefore he must not be knowable in the strict sense of the term19 With this God there is "no necessary and therefore intelligible relation." For Strauss, the idea of a personal God is evidence of the chasm that separates belief from philosophy: There is only one objection against Plato-Aristotle: and that is the factum brutum of revelation, or of the "personal" God. I say factum brutum - for there is no argument whatsoever , theoretical, practical, existential . . . not even the argument of paradox from the agnoia theou which characterizes the genuine philosopher to belief. (Italics Strauss's)20 Instead of attempting to bridge the divide between human questioning and divine mystery by means of philosophical argument, the Bible speaks of the covenant God makes with his people. While God freely enters into this relationship, it is not accurate to speak of the covenant as free from the perspective of the human partner, because the chosen people were commanded, not asked, to fulfill the divine laws. The biblical God, as presented by Strauss, is omnipotent, inscrutable, omniscient mysterious, incomprehensible, unpredictable, and free.21 While the God of the Bible is, like the god of Aristotle, a "thinking being," Strauss consistently stresses the divine will. l8"Progress or Return," pp. 1 13-1 14. 19"Progress or Return," p. 114. 20Karl Lowith and Leo Strauss, "Correspondence Concerning Modernity," Independent Journal of Philosophy, Vol. IV (1983), p. 1 1 1 . 21Leo Strauss, "On the Interpretation of Genesis," in Susan Orr, Jerusalem and Athens: Reason and Revelation in the Works of Leo Strauss (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlef√≠eld, 1995), pp. 2 1 0-2 1 1 , 225 ; "Jerusalem and Athens," p. 1 96; "Progress or Return," p. 1 1 5 ; Persecution and the Art of Writing, p. 140.</page><page sequence="7">Leo Strauss on Jerusalem and Athens 91 From a biblical perspective God' s will is beyond human grasp, although it is exercised with the welfare of God's people in mind. Unlike the gods of the Greeks, this is a loving and merciful God who makes promises to the chosen people, including the promise of ultimate redemption.22 At the same time, the God of the Bible is capable of punishing severely those who disobey divine commands, even when such disobedience seems to spring from an evidently moral or even noble response to the situation at hand. God's commands must be obeyed, however unintelligible or contrary to morality they may seem.23 These seemingly contradictory characteristics of the biblical God are, in Strauss's view, a manifestation of the mysterious nature of God: If God is incomprehensible and yet not unknown, and this is implied in the idea of God's omnipotence, it is impossible to speak about God without making contradictory statements about him. The comprehensible God, the God about whom we can speak without making contradictions, we can say is the God of Aristotle and not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In Strauss's view, "the mysteries of the Torah are the contradictions of the Torah; the mysteries of God are the contradictions regarding God." The apparent discrepancy between divine love and mercy on one hand, and divine commands that seem to violate both intelligence and morality on the other hand, is a consequence of the fact that "God alone is unqualifiedly, if unfathomably just."24 The mysterious God of whom it is not possible to speak without contradiction, and whose will is inscrutable, is also the holy God: But there is one decisive difference between Nietzsche ' s philosophy of the future and Plato's philosophy. Nietzsche's philosopher of the future is an heir to the Bible. He is an heir to that deepening of the soul which has been effected by the Biblical belief in a God that is holy. The philosopher of the future, as distinct from the classical philosopher, will be concerned with the holy. His philosophizing will be intrinsically religious.25 Central to Jerusalem's self-understanding is its relationship to the holy God. However, neither here nor elsewhere does Strauss explicitly discuss what it means to say that God is holy. In the passage just cited he links God's holiness to the emergence of a profound sense of inwardness. Holiness is that which marks religious phenomena as religious in contrast to the experiences characteristic of philosophy. But this sheds little light on either the specific character of holiness or the nature of the distinctively "religious." Occasionally, however, we are provided with an indication as to what 22" Jerusalem and Athens," pp. 196, 198-199. 23"Jerusalem and Athens," pp. 189, 195; "Progress or Return," pp. 107, 109. 24"On Genesis," pp. 210-21 1; "Jerusalem and Athens," pp. 187, 195. 25Leo Strauss, "An Introduction to Heideggerian Existentialism," in The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism , p. 41.</page><page sequence="8">92 SHOFAR Winter 2004 Vol. 22, No. 2 Strauss has in mind. Discussing the encounter of Isaiah, Amos, and Jeremiah with the holy God, Strauss brings out the overwhelming sense of God's majesty, before which the prophets experience themselves as weak and impure.26 Elsewhere he criticizes Hermann Cohen's identification of God's holiness with love and justice, and questions Cohen's claim that "with the progress of biblical thought Might recedes into the background and Holiness comes to the fore." Strauss further notes how Cohen's notion of holiness seems to have little in common with the holiness code of Leviticus.27 Strauss's comments with regard to the holiness of God suggest that holiness is simply another way of rendering God's mystery and omnipotence.28 Parallel to their differences in understanding the nature of God, Jerusalem and Athens disagree as to the proper human orientation toward transcendent reality. Strauss observes how, "according to the Bible, the beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord; according to the Greek philosophers, the beginning of wisdom is wonder." The Bible teaches that human beings are to live in "child-like simplicity and obedience to God."29 The appropriate human response to this God is one of trust and loving obedience regardless of the content of the divine command. Within the biblical horizon, God's love frequently manifests itself in ways that defy human comprehension. Strauss contrasts the exemplary philosophical man, Socrates, with Abraham, a model of biblical piety. Faced with an unintelligible command to sacrifice his son, Abraham obeys without question. 26" Jerusalem and Athens," pp. 202-203; Leo Strauss, History of Political Philosophy , third edition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), p. 296. 27Leo Strauss, "Introductory Essay to Hermann Cohen, Religion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism ," in Jewish Philosophy , p. 273. 28Strauss's emphasis on the mysterious, even arbitrary character of the biblical God has contributed to some lively polemics among his followers. Thomas Pangle, one of the most well- respected interpreters of Strauss's thought, is of the view that, even though Strauss notes differences between biblical thought and that of the Greek poets, such differences are of secondary importance, compared to the ways in which biblical revelation is liable to the same rational criticism as that directed by Plato against the poets. Pangle identifies the primary quarrel in Strauss' work as that between philosophy and the poets. Other Strauss scholars, such as Harry Jaffa and Susan Orr, reject this interpretation, insisting that Pangle has blurred the distinction between Yahweh and Zeus, something Strauss never did. These critics maintain that the primary division in Strauss's work is the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns, with the Bible standing with classical philosophy against modernity. I believe, both views have something to recommend them, and both can be supported from Strauss's writings.

Abraham's obedience is attributed to "his supreme trust in God, his simple, single-minded, child-like faith."31 Strauss describes the alternatives of faith and philosophy as a choice between a life of "obedient love" and a life of "autonomous understanding" or "free insight."32 The Bible should be read as teaching that "man is not meant to be a theoretical, a knowing, a contemplating being; man is meant to live in child-like obedience." A life of faith is not compatible with a life of genuine freedom: "The Bible . . . confronts us more clearly than any other book with this fundamental alternative: life in obedience to revelation, life in obedience, or life in human freedom, the latter being represented by Greek philosophers."33 It appears as if for Strauss, there is little possibility of combining a life of inquiry with the way of faith. He creates the impression that while philosophy is for thoughtful, mature, adults; faith is better suited to the simple and the child-like. This disagreement with respect to the best way of life carries over into a conflict concerning what it is that completes morality: According to the Greek philosophers ... it is understanding or contemplation. Now this necessarily tends to weaken the majesty of the moral demands, whereas humility, a sense of guilt, repentance, and faith in divine mercy, which complete morality according to the Bible, necessarily strengthen the majesty of the moral demands.34 Strauss describes some of the consequences of these differences; noting how biblical humility "excludes magnanimity in the Greek sense," and how for the Bible (in contrast to Greek philosophy) the terms "poor" and "pious" are nearly synonymous. He also points out how compared to the Bible, classical philosophy is rather "heartless." The stringent demands of biblical morality create an atmosphere in which men and women live in "fear and trembling," but these believers also live in hope because of the divine promise of final redemption. This is not the case for the philosopher, who "lives in a state above fear and trembling as well as above hope," resulting in a state of "peculiar serenity," a serenity rooted in resignation.35 30"Progress or Return," pp. 119, 110. 31" Jerusalem and Athens," p. 195. 32"Progress or Return," p. 104; Natural Right and History, p. 74. 33"Progress or Return," pp. 115, 119; "On the Interpretation of Genesis," p. 224. 34"Progress or Return," p. 108. 35"Progress or Return," pp. 107-109; Leo Strauss, "On the Euthyphron" in The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism , p. 206.</page><page sequence="10">94 SHOFAR Winter 2004 Vol. 22, No. 2 Not surprisingly, Strauss believes that "no one can be both a philosopher and a theologian, or, for that matter, some possibility which transcends the conflict between philosophy and theology, or pretends to be a synthesis of both."36 Between Athens and Jerusalem, no synthesis is possible; because "syntheses always sacrifice the decisive claim of one of the two elements."37 Their incompatibility is of a depth that any attempt at synthesis will suppress or eliminate the distinctive character of either Athens or Jerusalem. The seeming syntheses of the Bible and classical philosophy, so characteristic of Western civilization, are, in fact, the subordination of one tradition to the other. Even when a synthesis appears successful, it will undoubtedly be the case that the subordinated element will rebel against the dominant partner.38 For Strauss, "[e]very synthesis is actually an option either for Jerusalem or for Athens."39 Girard and Strauss Strauss poses the problem of Jerusalem and Athens in dramatic terms. The way of the Bible and the way of philosophy are not compatible. No new culture can be created through a blending of the salient features of each tradition. Where this has been attempted, it has always been to the detriment of either faith or reason. Like Strauss, Ren√© Girard is a thinker who possesses a keen interest in the relationship between Jerusalem and Athens. Both men return to and draw upon these pre-modern traditions in order to illuminate our current situation, although the conclusions they draw from this recovery are, in many ways, quite different. They both argue that, regardless of whether or not one shares the faith of the Bible, it is impossible to understand the contemporary world or to do serious work in the social sciences without considering its influence. Despite this agreement, I will argue that, from a Girardian perspective, Strauss misses the crucial difference between the two traditions. To critique Strauss in light of Girard's thought is not to impose an arbitrary or ill-fitting grid on Strauss's philosophy. It is to apply the insights of an equally masterful reader of texts to questions raised by Strauss himself, and to consider whether these insights explain the texts in a way that supplements, fulfills, or corrects Strauss's own interpretation and goals. We begin with Strauss's statement that, the "rejection of mythology is also charac- teristic of the primary impulse of philosophy, but the biblical rejection of mythology proceeds in the opposite direction to what philosophy does " (italics mine). Girard would 36"Progress or Return," p. 1 16. 37"On the Interpretation of Genesis," p. 224. 38"Thucydides: The Meaning of Political History" pp. 72-73; "Progress or Return," p. 104. 39Leo Strauss and Eric VoegeXm, Faith and Political Philosophy: The Correspondence Between Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, 1 934-1 964 , translated and edited by Peter Emberley and Barry Cooper (University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993), p. 78.</page><page sequence="11">Leo Strauss on Jerusalem and Athens 95 agree with Strauss's comment, and those familiar with Girard's thought may well anticipate that Strauss is on the verge of a similar insight into the connection between the violence of myth and the anti-mythological stance of the Bible. For Girard, myths transfigure and thereby disguise the scapegoating violence at the basis of culture. Philosophy arises, in part, as a response to a cultural crisis in which the myths have begun to lose their effectiveness. Philosophers criticize myths for their scandalous and ridiculous stories about the gods, but instead of bringing to light the violence at their core, philosophy creates a more "rational" screen with which to hide the violence. Girard insists that it is only in the Judeo-Christian scriptures that the phenomenon of scapegoating is fully revealed.40 Strauss too, appears to be cognizant of the violent aspect of myth: "mythology is characterized by the conflict between gods and impersonal powers behind the gods."41 Like Girard, he knows that the Bible and philos- ophy are opposed to myth, and that myth is infused with violence. In contrast to Girard, though, Strauss does not identify the decisive difference between Jerusalem and Athens in their rejection of myth as having to do with the question of violence. According to Strauss, the Bible rejects myth because of its insistence that there is only one divine law: "the divine character of all other allegedly divine codes is simply denied, and this implies a radical rejection of mythology."42 One divine law means one omnipotent creator God. From this follows the belief that the gods of myth are not gods at all, and myths are false tales. Classical philosophy also rejects myth, but for reasons different from those offered by the Bible. Myth and philosophy have in common the quest for the "first things," the fundamental principles of reality, but philosophy goes beyond myth by replacing the traditional gods and the impersonal powers behind them with the idea of nature.43 Philosophy moves away from myth as a result of its questioning of earlier poetic and religious accounts of reality, a questioning motivated by a desire for greater consistency and systematic coherence. Greek thought moves from the embarrassingly anthropomorphic gods, to more abstract notions such as "fate," to the equally impersonal ideas of "nature and intelligible necessity."44 How different this is from the biblical revelation of the personal God, in comparison to whom the gods of 40Ren√© Girard, The Scapegoat , trans.

Among the Greeks then, we find a development toward a conception of the "impersonal" character of "nature and intelligible necessity," while the Bible presents us with an omnipotent creator God to whom alone worship is due. For Strauss, philosophy evolves toward an idea of the limits or constraints imposed by the necessities inherent in the nature of things, necessities that human beings as human are capable of grasping by means of their reason. Rather than intelligible necessity, the Bible speaks of commands issuing from the will of an all-powerful and mysterious God, a will known primarily through revelation. This distinction is an important one for Strauss because it allows him to speak of the "necessities" discovered by philosophy as rational in comparison with the unpredictable will of the biblical God, which, if not quite irrational, so exceeds reason as to be incomprehensible. At the same time, the idea of a constraining power is common to both Athens and Jerusalem; philosophy can no more alter the intelligible necessities than the pious can alter the will of God.45 But as we shall see, there is in Strauss a tendency to justify the "necessities" discovered by philosophy because they are deemed to be "rational." It does not occur to him that these "rational necessities" may be the philosophical transfiguration of a far more disturbing truth. To further specify the manner in which Strauss distinguishes Jerusalem and Athens, we will give some attention to Girard' s critique of Heidegger and consider whether Strauss's thought is liable to the same critique. There are a number of reasons for proceeding in this fashion. First of all, there is Strauss's acknowledged indebtedness to Heidegger.46 Looking back on his friendship with Jacob Klein, Strauss remarks, 4 "Nothing affected us as profoundly in the years in which our minds took their lasting directions as the thought of Heidegger." Klein convinced Strauss of the necessity of recovering the teaching of classical philosophy, and Klein was the first to understand that it had been Heidegger who made this recovery possible. Much like Strauss, Heidegger attempted to get to the roots of the philosophical tradition "as they are," which is to say as "natural and healthy."47 Both Strauss and Heidegger return to the Greeks for inspiration, 45 Along these same lines, Strauss speaks of natural right as a matter of limits and constraints. See Natural Right and History , p. 130 and On Tyranny , p. 191 . 46 As a doctoral student Strauss attended some of Heidegger's lectures and came away from the experience with the belief that he had "never seen before such seriousness, profundity, and concentration in the interpretation of philosophic texts" ("An Introduction to Heideggerian Existentialism," p. 28). 47Leo Strauss, "An Unspoken Prologue to a Public Lecture at St. John's College in Honor of Jacob Klein," in Jewish Philosophy , p. 450. It should be added that Strauss's appreciation of Heidegger's achievement is not uncritical. In philosophical term, Strauss dislikes Heidegger's "historicism" for contributing to a dangerous relativism. He also seems to have taken the view that, while Heidegger's philosophy does not inevitably lead to a phenomenon like Nazism, its emphasis on "resoluteness" certainly prepares the ground for an acceptance of such ideological movements. For a discussion of</page><page sequence="13">Leo Strauss ori Jerusalem and Athens 97 however much they may diverge in their interpretations of the classical past. Given this similarity, it is relevant to ask whether Strauss's attempted recovery of the Greeks is accompanied by problems similar to those Girard detects in Heidegger. Girard's most extensive comments on Heidegger occur in the context of what is in effect a discussion of Athens and Jerusalem, focusing upon a comparison of the logos of Heraclitus and the logos of the Gospel According to John.48 For Girard the difference between the two logoi revolves around the issue of violence. The Heraclitean logos is the logos of culture-sustaining violence, while the Johannine logos is forever being expelled from societies founded and perpetuated by violence. Girard is critical of the attempts within Western culture to bring the two logoi into harmony.49 He credits Heidegger with being the first to see that the Greek logos and the biblical logos are not the same, and that their meanings are in fact opposed. Girard also approves of Heidegger's insight into the inherent violence of the Heraclitean logos. But Girard faults Heidegger for accepting "modern thought's most widespread clich√© concerning the Old Testament," the view that the biblical God is authoritarian and despotic. In doing this, Heidegger introduces violence into the biblical logos, thus obscuring the very differences he claims to recognize.50 It remains to consider whether the same criticism is applicable to Strauss. There is no question that Strauss sees Jerusalem and Athens as locked in a relationship of opposition. The two cities are in conflict with one another, and this struggle constitutes the very life of the West. The logos of Western civilization is, for Strauss, a logos of war. It resembles closely the Heraclitean logos, "the violence of the sacred, which keeps doubles in relative harmony and prevents them from destroying one another."51 Athens and Jerusalem are indeed doubles. Resembling each other in their opposition to modernity and in their basic agreement with regard to the importance of virtue, they are, nevertheless, warring doubles, diverging radically on "the one thing needful" as they contend for the allegiance of humanity. Neither Athens nor Jerusalem is capable of landing the decisive blow to permanently defeat the other. Instead, they remain enmeshed in a struggle without end: Each of the two antagonists claims to know or to hold the truth, the decisive truth, the truth regarding the right way of life. But there can be only one truth: hence, conflict between these Strauss's relationship to Heidegger see Steven B.

Each of the two opponents has tried for millennia to refute the other. This effort is continuing in our day, and in fact it is taking on a new intensity after some decades of indifference.52 Especially striking in Strauss' s formulation of the problem both here and elsewhere is his tendency to see the choice for Athens or Jerusalem in starkly disjunctive terms, and his penchant for the language of conflict and struggle. Referring to Heidegger, Girard could just as well be speaking of Strauss when he says: He replaces the relationship of mutual tolerance between the two types of Logos with a relationship of antagonism The warring doubles have been installed in the very heart of European thought.53 Although he stresses the conflict at the heart of Western civilization, Strauss is more circumspect than Heidegger when it comes to discussing the violence of Athens. If Girard discovers in Heidegger the bold claim that "the Greek Logos is inseparably linked with violence,"54 the same can hardly be said of Strauss's understanding of classical culture. This is due, in part, to his tendency to distinguish between philosophy and the city when speaking of Athens. The requirements of the city do not always coincide with those of philosophy. The philosopher needs the security, order, and necessities of life provided by the city in order to practice the philosophical way of life. But that way of life, by its very nature, leads to a questioning of the traditional verities upon which the city depends for its stability.55 The city will likely find it necessary to make use of violence in order to preserve its security; according to the classics, the "establishment of the best regime will not include the cessation of war."56 Yet Strauss tends to make the classical attitude toward violence seem as reasonable and unobjec- tionable as possible. Discussing Thrasymachos' opinion about justice in the Republic , Strauss argues: 52"Progress or Return?," p. 123. 53Girard, Things Hidden , pp. 265-266. Nietzsche's influence on Strauss did not go unnoticed by one of Strauss's most devoted students: "Appealing from one part of Nietzsche's fertile thought to another part, Leo Strauss can be said to have subscribed to the desirability of maintaining, instead of synthesis, a 'magnificent tension of the spirit' that stimulates human life in general and human thought in particular. The phrase comes from the preface of Beyond Good and Evil , a work admired by Leo Strauss as Nietzsche's most beautiful book."

If we look then at Thrasymachos' indignation without indignation, we must admit that his violent reaction is to some extent a revolt of common sense. Since the city as city is a society which from time to time must wage war, and war is inseparable from harming innocent people, the unqualified condemnation of harming human beings would be tantamount to the condemnation of even the justest city.57 Whether or not one agrees with Strauss's judgment, the justification of his conclusion through an appeal to "common sense" is a way of persuading his readers to appreciate the reasonableness of Thrasymachos' position. Elsewhere Strauss praises the moderation and even leniency of Athens in dealing with its citizens; and to the objection that it was Athenian democracy that killed Socrates, he explains that Socrates "was killed when he was 70; he was permitted to live for 70 long years."58 Strauss bristles at those who criticize Plato for his "alleged lack of liberalism" and reminds them of how tolerant Plato is even by contemporary measures. Plato followed the standards of his time, and those standards "are best illustrated by the practice of Athens, a city highly renowned for her liberality and gentleness." In its reasonableness and moderation, Strauss believes the classical understanding of politics comes closest to liberal or constitutional democracy.59 If the city must at times employ violence in order to secure itself, philosophy as such has no part (at least directly) in such activities. Warfare may be a requirement of the city, but it is has nothing to do with philosophy - even though philosophy depends on the city for its existence. For Strauss, questioning and a delight in the truth for its own sake characterize the philosophical life. Philosophy is rational, serene, and moderate; it is "graced by nature's grace."60 The philosopher, as the embodiment of the desire for eternal wisdom, rises above quarrels of the vulgar: The philosopher's dominating passion is the desire for truth, i.e., for the knowledge of the eternal order, or the eternal cause or causes of the whole. As he looks up in search for the eternal order, all human things and all human concerns reveal themselves to him in all clarity as paltry and ephemeral, and no one can find solid happiness in what he knows to be paltry and ephemeral.61 51 History of Political Philosophy , p. 37. 58"What Is Political Philosophy?," p. 36. 59 History of Political Philosophy , p. 86; On Tyranny , pp. 193-194. 60Leo Strauss, "What Is Political Philosophy?," in What Is Political Philosophy?

Nevertheless, it remains the case that: The philosopher is immune to the most common and the most powerful dissolvent of man's natural attachment to man, the desire to have more than one has already and in particular to have more than others have; for he has the greatest self-sufficiency which is humanly possible. Hence the philosopher will not hurt anyone. While he cannot help being more attached to his family and his city than to strangers, he is free from the delusions bred by collective egoisms; his benevolence or humanity extends to all human beings with whom he comes into contact.62 This description of the philosopher occurs in an essay dealing with Xenophon's Hiero that is part of an exchange with Hegelian philosopher Alexandre Kojeve. A significant portion of the essay consists of Strauss's challenge to Kojeve's claim that the philosopher is motivated, as are all human beings, by a desire for recognition. As is clear from the passages just cited, Strauss's philosopher, in communion with the eternal order, transcends such desire, and is thereby freed from any inclination to compete with or harm others. In Girardian terms, the philosopher would seem to be impervious to the contagion of mimetic desire and the violence to which it can lead. However much violence may be necessary to preserve the city, Strauss avoids introducing any taint of violence into philosophy itself. Athens is presented as an exemplary regime, a city that makes reasonable and judicious use of violence. Philosophy, the crowning achievement of Athens, recognizes the exigencies behind the city's recourse to violence, while taking no direct part in such unfortunate necessities. If, then, the spirit of Athens is one of moderation, gentleness, and free philosophical inquiry, what are we to say of Jerusalem, the city to which Athens stands opposed? An answer is suggested by Strauss's recurring emphasis on the unfathomable power of the biblical God. There is, in his depiction, more than a trace of the "widespread clich√©" of divine authoritarianism that Girard detects in Heidegger. This is not to deny Strauss's belief in the distinctiveness of the Bible in relation to Greek philosophy with regard to ideas such as redemption, covenant, creation, and divine mercy. He unquestionably regards these ideas as central to the biblical message. On the whole, though, the primary focus in his reading of the Bible is on a God who is powerful, who displays that power in ways that are unintelligible to human beings, and who is to be feared. For example, as part of his critique of Spinoza, Strauss presents the following charge: To the "carnal" attitude of fear Spinoza opposes the "spiritual" attitude of love. He understands only the absolute antithesis: fear - love; he does not understand the fear of God, which is the precondition and an ingredient of love of God.

Great as is the difference between the gnostics, Marcion, the Socinians, the English deists among themselves, and however wide a gap may yawn between all these and Spinoza, there is one element which all of them have in common: a revulsion against the jealous God of Wrath shown in Scripture, in favor of the God of Love.63 Taken out of context as it is here, we might suspect that Strauss is about to correct Spinoza's misunderstanding by noting how the "jealous God of Wrath" decried by Spinoza and like-minded individuals is in fact a caricature of the biblical God. Strauss does not do this; instead he distinguishes between "true fear of God and superstitious fear of God, between fear of God and a slavish state of mind."64 Strauss implies that Spinoza and his intellectual allies have failed to understand the Bible as exemplifying the true fear of God. Perhaps, by the "true fear of God," Strauss means an attitude of awe and wonder before the divine mystery. Yet this view is difficult to sustain, since Strauss contrasts the biblical "fear and trembling" before God with the "sense of wonder" that he attributes to philosophy.65 In other places Strauss speaks in ways that suggest that the Bible is closer to what he describes as the superstitious fear of God. Strauss praises the medieval Islamic thinker Farabi for having rediscovered the "golden mean" of Plato's political thought, setting a standard "equally removed from a naturalism which aims only at sanctioning the savage and destructive instincts of 'natural man'... and from a supernaturalism which tends to become the basis of slave moralit√Ω' italics mine).66 Ever the cautious commentator, Strauss does not elaborate on the meaning of "supernaturalism," or explain its connection to slave morality. We have more than a hint, though, from the following comments on Genesis: Man was denied knowledge of good and evil, i.e., the knowledge sufficient for guiding himself, his life. While not being a child he was to live in child-like simplicity and obedience to God.67 The biblical teaching would seem to be that, in accordance with the divine will, we are not capable of guiding ourselves. This would be understandable if we had been created to be perpetual children. But Strauss specifically rejects this view as the Bible's teaching. His point is that even though we are not children, God commands us to live as if we are. Biblical piety requires adults who have been reduced to the level of obedient 63Leo Strauss, Spinoza 's Critique of Religion , trans. E. M.

It would be difficult to imagine a better description of the "slavish state of mind" Strauss attributes to superstitious fear of God, or a better basis for the slave morality he associates with supernaturalism.68 Fear of punishment is, in fact, an important element in Strauss's understanding of the fear of God. Adam and Eve are punished severely, despite their relatively innocent drift into disobedience. If God's punishment is already harsh at the very beginning of humankind, what are we to make of Strauss's comment that, in order to explain Cain's punishment, we must assume "that punishments were milder in the beginning than later on"?69 In "Progress or Return," he interrupts his discussion of the divine law in order to enumerate some of the consequences of the opposition between Athens and Jerusalem on this issue. He proceeds to offer examples drawn from the Bible, comparing them with Greek depictions of the philosopher and the gentleman. The selected examples revolve around a similar theme. First there is Saul, who, in doing the noble thing by sparing King Agag, disobeys the divine command to destroy every living creature he has conquered. Because of this, God rejects him, and the unfortunate Agag is hacked to pieces by the prophet Samuel. Another example concerns David and his wife, Michal. She berates him for his undignified behavior in dancing before commoners; as a result she is punished with sterility. Finally, no such inventory of Bible stories would be complete without the example of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son in response to the divine command. There is a lesson to be learned from these examples and an illuminating comparison with the philosophical life: God, the king or the judge, is the object of fear; and God, the father of all men, makes all men brothers, and thus hallows pity. According to Aristotle, without these feelings, which have to be purged by tragedy, the better type of man is liberated from all morbidity and thus can turn wholeheartedly to noble action.70 It is difficult to imagine anyone inclining toward Jerusalem after this recitation of "typical" Bible stories; especially as in Athens we are offered liberation from morbidity and the possibility of noble actions. Once again, moderate and rational Athens is contrasted with a Jerusalem governed by fear of divine chastisement wedded to a hope 680f course one could argue that the Bible does indeed call for child-like trust in God. There is a sense in which this is undoubtedly true, but I would still maintain that when Strauss focuses on this theme it is usually in a context in which the child-like simplicity called for by the Bible is contrasted with the classical emphasis on freedom and the ability to exercise one's intelligence to the fullest. The Bible establishes no such contrast. It is also interesting to note that when Strauss takes up the theme of child-like trust and simplicity, he almost never presents it as the Bible does - as the human response to God's tenderness and mercy. Instead, Strauss gives the impression that an attitude of child-like simplicity is the best way to avoid God's punishment. 69"Jerusalem and Athens," pp. 189-190. 70"Progress or Return," p. 108.</page><page sequence="19">Leo Strauss on Jerusalem and Athens 103 for divine mercy. It would be foolish to deny that the illustrations cited by Strauss reflect under- standings of God that can be found in the Bible. Even Girard acknowledges that the Bible, "in its most primitive sections," "still remains sufficiently wedded to violence for people to be able to brand it as violent without appearing totally implausible."71 But how one selects and arranges such illustrations is crucial, and in the examples provided by Strauss we are given the impression that the God of the Bible is willful, harsh, arbitrary, and violent. It is not difficult to understand why some critics accuse Strauss of blurring the distinction between Yahweh and Zeus.72 Strauss concludes this section of "Progress or Return" with the statement that while his examples may be "to a certain extent arbitrary," they are "not misleading."73 If that is true, then the God of the Bible is indeed to be feared. From what we have seen of Strauss's treatment of violence as it appears in Athens and Jerusalem, Girard's criticism of Heidegger can be extended to Strauss: "He sees the former as violence committed by free men, while the latter is violence visited upon slaves." Strauss does not detect the gradual revelation of the scapegoating mechanism at work in the Jewish Bible,74 nor does he realize that "what appears to us to be Yahweh' s violence is in fact the attempt of the entire Old Testament to bring to light the violent reciprocal action of doubles."75 It would seem then, that Strauss is susceptible to Girard's critique of Heidegger. Above all, we find the same understanding of Athens and Jerusalem as warring doubles and the same rejection of any synthesis or harmonization between them. Girard's observation about Heidegger fits Strauss as well: The illusion that there is a difference within the heart of violence is the key to the sacrificial way of thinking. ... He wishes to differentiate the two types of Logos, but by inserting violence into both of them, he deprives himself of the means for doing so!76 Strauss contrasts the enlightened and prudent violence of the Greek city with the 71 Things Hidden , p. 268. 72Shadia Drury, The Political Ideas of Leo Strauss (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1988), p. 47. 73"Progress or Return?," pp. 107-1 10. 74This is not to blame Strauss for not being Girard. It is to raise the question as to why someone who reads texts as meticulously as Strauss does not pay more attention to such a prominent biblical theme. Of course it would be unrealistic to expect every serious reader of the Bible to develop a notion of the scapegoating mechanism, but it is nearly impossible to read the biblical text and not notice that God intervenes in history on behalf of victims. Strauss acknowledges, but hardly emphasizes this central message of the Scriptures. lsThings Hidden, pp. 266-268. See also Raymund Schwager, Must There Be Scapegoats ?&gt; trans. Maria L.

Violence is, nonetheless, common to both. As in Heidegger, the warring parties may not be as dissimilar as we have been led to believe. Strauss, like Heidegger, does not distinguish the two cities, as Girard does, in terms of their attitude toward violence. Instead, he opposes Jerusalem, with its unquestioning obedience to the unfathomable will of God, to Athens, the embodiment of freedom, wonder, and the love of knowledge. On this point we reach an important difference between Strauss and Heidegger. Unlike Heidegger, who, in Girard' s reading, does not shrink from acknowledging the centrality of violence in the logos of Greek philosophy, Strauss strives to protect philosophy from any association with violence. For Heidegger, the association of violence and logos in Greek thought leads him in the direction of a recovery of the violent sacred. In the case of Strauss, we find a movement away from any connection of philosophy with violence, in the direction of Socratic/Platonic rationalism. What is missing in Strauss is any suggestion that "reason" may itself be complicit in the process of victimization. Finding fault with modernity, Strauss advocates a recovery of classical wisdom. He is convinced that the philosopher's transcendence of the liabilities that beset other human beings will have the beneficent effect of bringing reason to bear in the realm of the political. Strauss trusts classical philosophy to provide a model of "reason" that can remedy the excesses and deficiencies of modern thought. He does not realize, as Girard does, that "our own rationality cannot reach the founding role of mimetic victimage because it remains tainted with it. . . . Reason itself is a child of the foundational mur- der."77 In a reversal of Girard, Strauss interprets Jerusalem sacrificially and Athens non- sacrificially. To be more precise, he identifies as central those aspects of the Bible that can be interpreted sacrificially, while cloaking the sacrificial character of philosophy in the language of rationality. By opting for Athens over Jerusalem in this way, Strauss fails to see the extent to which Athens perpetuates the very persecutory mechanisms he decries in his political philosophy, just as he fails to appreciate the extent to which Jerusalem is the source of the conviction that victims should not be sacrificed for the sake of the city. With an incomplete understanding of the biblical message, Strauss never arrives at the truth about the victim that the Bible reveals, a truth that resonates so powerfully with the motivation behind his own work. 77Ren√© Girard, A Theatre of Envy (Leonminster: Gracewing, 2000), p. 208.</page></plain_text>
