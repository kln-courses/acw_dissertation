<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERMANN LONS AND THE MODERN GERMAN ANIMAL TALE FRANK X. BRAUN University of Michigan It is one of the paradoxes in the strange career of Hermann Lons (i866-I914) that literary fame to which he so ardently aspired through the medium of the novel should have come to him only by way of his "bread and butter" writings. For L6ns, the journalist, today enjoys the reputation of being both a pioneer and one of the early masters of the modern German animal tale. He possessed to a unique degree both literary artistry and scientific training. Since the so-called modern animal tale is of hybrid origin, stemming from the union of belles-lettres and science, Lans, it would seem, was eminently suited and practically predestined to perform his role as initiator of a new trend in the Ger- man animal narrative. Initiator though he was of a new type of animal fiction, he was firmly rooted in the past, both as a man of letters and a man of science. It is generally accepted that Ldns' distinction as a writer lies in the field of the impressionistic sketch (a fact which be- comes manifest also in his novels), and in style and general outlook he has been fittingly compared with Liliencron. However, the scientific component of his art needs to be treated more fully, both because it has been less thoroughly investigated and because it is the newest ele- ment in animal fiction. As a man of science, Lbns was a product of nineteenth century zoology, and a voluminous bibliography of contributions, some of them dating back to his Gymnasium days, attests to his stature as an original researcher. Nineteenth century zoology, under the impact of Darwin- ism, rapidly advanced from microscopy, mensuration, and comparative description, from the subdividing of subdivisions, to a more over-all view of the animal as a biological entity. This trend is reproduced in miniature and compressed into a shorter period of time in Ldns' own development as a scientist. Notwithstanding Ldns' reputation as a zoologist, let it be stressed at the very beginning that it was not purely scientific accuracy that placed the mark of uniqueness on his subsequent animal narratives. His true originality lay in the fact that he expressed in a very personal manner an attitude which developments in intellectual history had made possible. In the humanistic realm he was a pioneer, therefore, only insofar as he, in his dual capacity as artist and scientist, was capable of feeling and of communicating a certain emotional attitude toward the world which science had revealed. To be sure, he did use the materials of science, but in his hands they were transformed into literature, because these materials, in the selective and recreative pro- cess of his imagination, assumed an additional human significance with- out losing scientific veracity or probability.</page><page sequence="2">Hermann Liins 77 Significant as the advance of pure science was in the nineteenth century, of still greater and more immediate import from the human- istic point of view were the writings of the great nineteenth century naturalists, men like Tschudi, Brehms, and a host of others. In their works were reflected, in a somewhat popularized form, the findings of pure science. It was this group of writers who, to a great extent, generated the intellectual climate and the emotional willingness to accept science's changing view of the natural world.- Lons not only was heir to but actually carried on the work of these nineteenth century naturalists when he contributed to a publishing venture which sub- sequently played the role of accoucheur to the modern German animal tale. In 190o, the publisher R. Voigtlander commissioned the zoologist Hermann Meerwarth to edit a series of volumes of animal sketches. Meerwarth was fortunate enough to procure a number of collaborators who measured up to his somewhat unusual requirements: he demanded scientific training, highly developed powers of observation, and literary or journalistic skill. The most brilliant member of Meerwarth's group was Hermann Lons.3 His contributions to Meerwarth's Bilder aus der Tierwelt " are not what Castelle claims them to be, namely "Tiernovel- len," but they do represent descriptive natural history in ideal form. The inspiring success of Meerwarth's animal biographies proved to be the catalyst needed for the metamorphosis of natural history to belles- lettres. The last stage in the subsequent development was the inclusion of the narrative element, the event, and with that the animal took its 1 Friedrich von Tschudi, Tierleben der Alpen (1853); Alfred Brehm, Tierleben, 6 vols. (i864-I869). L6ns spoke with great admiration of the work of the French naturalist Jean-Henri Fabre (Les Souvenirs Entomologiques, Io vols., 1879 ff.), who was called by Darwin "the inimitable observer." Lbns himself admits the stimulat- ing effect that the writings of the naturalist-poet Ferdinand von Droste-Hiilshoff had on his literary efforts, and he undoubtedly was acquainted with the widely read Spaziergiinge eines Naturforschers (1888), written by the popular professor of zoology at the University of Leipzig, William Marshall (1845-190o7). The naturalist who perhaps left the most direct imprint on the young university student L6ns was his zoology professor at Miinster, Professor Hermann Kolbe, of whom Leberecht Treu, a friend of L6ns, writes: "[Er] kam fiir uns gleich nach dem lieben Gott. Der hatte ja die Tiere geschaffen, aber Kolbe kannte sie alle." Lons Gedenkbuch (Hannover, 1917), p. 70. 2 It is a serious shortcoming of Hedwig Nell's Die gestaltanden Kriifte in der neue'n deutschen Tierdichtulng, (diss. Miinchen, 1937) not to have traced more thoroughly the role which naturalists played in German intellectual history. They were responsible for many revolutions in the realm of sensitivity and actually con- ditioned the possibility of L6ns' feeling about animals as he did. These men were truly the builders of bridges between man and animal and therefore constitute an important part of the background of modern German animal fiction. 3 See Albert Deimann, "Vom Werden der L6nsschen Tierdichtung," Markwart (Feb. 1927) Heft 8, p. i8. Among the other contributors were Fritz Bley and Egon von Kapherr, both of whom subsequently made a name for themselves in German animal fiction. Si2 volumes, 1907-I912.

It was a critical point in animal literature when the beast in fiction ceased to be pressed into service as a didactic tool, as a bludgeon in religious struggles, as a disguise for the depiction of human types, as an unfeeling target for the mighty hunter, or as a condescendingly anthropomorphic creature. The emancipation of the animal in literary history was achieved when the animal was granted the right to obey the recognized laws of its own nature; and it is this change in attitude, regardless of chronological or stylistic criteria, which separates the old from the modern animal tale. With the portrayal of the animal person- ality according to its own natural laws, the old dictum that man is the measure of all things must of necessity fall by the wayside. In order to avoid the cardinal sin of anthropomorphism, human norms of motiva- tion and behavior must surrender to genuine animal psychology. It is not surprising, therefore, that both authors and critics of animal fiction have bestowed the mark of highest merit upon one particular type of narrative, the objective animal tale, which is perhaps best defined by the distinguished British naturalist and author, Ivan T. Sanderson: It is [in the objective animal tale] that the finest of all animal literature is to be found, for the reader is taken into the mind of the animal to look out through its eyes, to hear through its ears, to smell through its nostrils, to taste through its mouth, and to feel through its skin. These various channels of sensation conspire to create the actual emotions of the animal in the reader's mind. Tales of the objective type are thus told entirely from the animal's point of view, but in our language and through our mental formula, and in the best examples they compound all that we know of the habits, behavior and outlook of the animals. In their purest form, they are the ultimate of the Ani- mal Tale. * In keeping with this definition, a story told from the human point of view, i. e. with the tendency "to endow the animal with desires, mo- tives, and emotions of man," the so-called subjective or anthropomorphic animal tale, must be looked for at the lower end of Sanderson's scale. With these generally accepted criteria in mind, a brief survey of the contributions of Hermann L6ns may now be attempted. Lans' animal tales, in short-story or Novelle form, are contained in volume IV of his collected works. The remaining seven volumes com- prise his poetry, over four hundred shorter prose pieces - predomin- antly nature and hunting sketches, five novels, and satirical writings. Most of the animal tales under discussion here originally appeared in book form under the well-known titles Miimmelmann (1909), and Widu, 8Ivan T.

Al- though these two collections of animal narratives were written within six years of each other, they are so significantly different, both in type and outlook, that they actually represent two different stages of Lins' narrative art. Miimmelmann, the first collection, presents a bewildering variety of tales. There are remnants from natural history ("Das Eichhdrnchen," "Die Zeit der schweren Not") where the all-important step from genus to specimen, i. e. from the animal type to the distinctive animal person- ality, is not yet evident. Interspersed here and there are some of Lbns' famous hunting tales in which the animal, though a marked personality, shares the center of the stage with the ego of its pursuer. Over half of the narratives, and this is significant, are clearly subjective animal fiction, since the characters, although well observed externally, are deliberately humanized in speech and motivation. Among these must be counted also the tales dealing with animals of domestic breed, which constitute the most notorious pitfall in all animal literature. In only two of the twenty narratives does L6ns approach the level of excellence that marks the majority of the objective tales in the second collection, Widu. In spite of the clearly transitional nature of the stories in Miimmelmann, this little volume is by far the more popular of the two, probably due to the earthy humor that pervades these subjective tales. For here we find heroic and philosophical hares talking Low German, a young cock snipe whose embarrassing marital difficulties are radically solved by a hungry fox, charming rabbit ladies who brag about their respective fertility, and other amusing tales which would indicate that Ldns the scientist is enjoying a holiday. Humor in animal tales, enjoyable as it may be, is nearly always a sign of anthropomorphism, for it usually implies that the author, for reasons of his own, observes with superior human insight a situation in animal life which the animal may not find humorous at all. There is, in addition, a characteristically Ldnsian note in these humorous animal narratives. All the creatures, wild or domestic, whom he depicts in a ludicrous or satirical vein, belong without exception in the lower categories of Ldns' personal animal hierarchy. In it are found all those who owe their survival to timidity, caution, and fertility as well as the unfree, security-loving animals of domestic breed. Both groups represent the plebeians and philistines among the animals, and they are treated according to Ldns' evaluation of the type and thus be- come a fit subject for comedy. Widu, Ldns' second collection of animal tales, however, is largely devoted to the aristocrats, to the intellectuals of the animal world, the carnivores. Employing predominantly the objective narrative style, he portrays, often with merciless realism, those whom he loves and respects</page><page sequence="5">80 Monatshefte - the hunters among the animals, as well as those of the herbivores whom he considers worthy of the hunt. In these objective animal tales about wolves and foxes, badgers and otters, weasels, stags and deer, Ldns becomes the neutral reporter of fascinating and dramatic animal fates. He merely lends his pen, so to speak, to record events as exper- ienced by the animal organism and interpreted by the animal mind. In this performance he is aided by his phenomenal power of observation, by a profound though judiciously controlled empathy, and above all by a willingness, rare among writers of animal literature, to sacrifice an- thropocentric intellectual complexities. Although disdainful of the for- mal animal psychology of his day, he nevertheless succeeded to a greater degree than many of his imitators in conveying a scientifically accurate and aesthetically satisfying picture of animal intelligence and animal emotions. There are short stories in Widu (to mention but two: "Ein Trauer- spiel" and "Das Ende") which, measured by any standard, deserve to be called classics of the genre. And thus within six years, between Mi)immel- mann and Widu, Lbns gained for modern German animal fiction a respected place in international literature. In doing so, he attained prac- tically in spite of himself the distinction of being both pioneer and master of a new type of animal narrative.</page></plain_text>
