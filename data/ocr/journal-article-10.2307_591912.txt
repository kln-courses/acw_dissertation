<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stephen Hester and David Francis Reality analysis in a classroom storzrtelling ABSTRACT In the first part of this paper ethnomethodology is compared with realist and social constructionist sociology, with specific reference to notions of 'reality'. In contrast with sociological concerns about the correct theorization of reality, for ethnomethodology 'reality' is approached as a members' phenomenon. Ethno- methodology seeks to investigate how concerns with the 'real' inform members' locally ordered practical action and reasoning. In the second part of the paper, we offer an ethnomethodological analysis of reality-as-a-members'-phenomenon in the context of a classroom storytelling. Our focus is on aspects of the teacher's and pupils' 'reality analysis' which is touched off by events within the story. The discussion is divided into two sections: the first examines the participants' analy- sis of the 'believability' of specific events in the story; the second considers their analysis of the status of these events with reference to the distinction between dreaming and being awake. In conclusion, we elaborate the differences between ethnomethodology's respecification of reality analysis as a topic of investigation and conventional sociology's theorizations of reality. In so doing, we emphasize the mundane and locally ordered character of members' - including sociologists' - reality analysis. KEYWORDS: reality; ethnomethodology; storytelling; education; categories INTRODUCTION In this paper we have two aims. Firstly, we wish to distinguish between the concerns of ethnomethodology and those of conventional sociology, with specific reference to notions of 'reality'. Our argument is that, while for conventional sociology the question of the correct theorization of reality is a matter of central debate, for ethnomethodology reality is not an issue about which any theoretical stance needs to be or should be taken. Rather, ethnomethodology seeks to examine the ways in which concerns with 'reality' inform members' locally ordered practical action and practical reasoning. Secondly, we wish to offer an ethnomethodological analysis of reality-aFa-members'-phenomenon as it is made available in the context of Bnt.

We conclude by elabor- ating the differences between ethnomethodology and sociology, and we emphasize the mundane and locally ordered character of members' - including sociologists' - reality analysis. REALITY CONSTRUCTION VERSUS REALITY ANALYSIS Within contemporary sociological theory, there is a debate between two contrasting theorizations of social reality. On the one hand, 'realism' emphasizes the real and objective character of social phenomena. On the other hand, a cluster of views standardly encompassed by the terms 'con- structionism' or 'social constructionism', emphasizes how the apparent objectivity of social phenomena is explicable in terms of social practices of 'reality construction'. Both approaches are ironic since they assume a con- trast between the ordinary ways in which members of society experience social life and the explanation of social life which is given from the stand- point of sociology. Thus, the realist argues that members experience the orderly nature of social life, and their own involvement in it, as character- ized by 'agency'. Such understanding, the realist asserts, 1S incomplete, if not false; whereas the member of society experiences agency as real and undeniable, the sociologist can show that 'agents' and their 'subjectivity' are in fact constrained and shaped by objective social structures and forces.1 In contrast, the social constructionist asserts that whereas members typi- cally view social life as comprising an objective realm of factual things, it can be demonstrated that such 'facts' are socially constructed artefacts. Social constructionism centres around the idea of 'the social construction of reali- ties'. By asserting a plurality of 'realities', constructionist sociologists divorce themselves from a (purportedly 'naive') commonsense view that there is just one reality.2 The 'correct' sociological ontology is that there are many 'realities', each relative to a certain social collectivity or environment. Thus, while it appears to a collectivity's members that (their) reality has such fea- tures as fixity, objectivity and transcendence, the sociologist can show that these features are nothing more than the product of activities by which points of view are achieved and upheld. Thus 'reality construction' is the sociologist's generic description for what the members are actually doing irre- spective of their own understandings of what they are doing. Notwithstanding attempts to reconcile them (e.g. Giddens 1984, Haber- mas 1988), these approaches comprise a fundamental dualism within soci- ology (Sharrock and Watson 1988). Ethnomethodology frequently has been positioned within the constructionist camp, indeed, it is almost conven- tional to regard it as representing an extreme and questionable version of constructionist premises (cf. Ashmore 1989, Gellner 1975). Such a view is, we would argue, a profound misconception of ethnomethodology's inter- ests and concerns. We take it that the fundamental problematic for ethnomethodological</page><page sequence="3">Rtality analysis in a classroom storytelling 97 inquiry is members' practical action and practical reasoning. All phenom- ena, including theorists' phenomena such as the distinctions between 'micro' and 'macro' and 'agency' and 'structure', are to be treated as memlers' phenomena, accomplished in the specifics of in situ social activity. Such activity includes the sociological theorizing in and through which the dualisms referred to above are accomplished as legitimate aus- pices under which professional sociological discussion of social life may proceed. For ethnomethodology all such auspices are respecified (Button 1991) as topics for investigation, rather than being taken for granted as resources for the conduct of sociological inquiry and the creation of proper fol llls of sociological explanation. In contrast with both the realist and con- structionist programmes, which are driven by an analytical concern to for- mulate a sociological theory of reality, ethnomethodology is interested in members' 'reality analysis'. This interest is fundamentally a descriptive one; it seeks to describe the mundane practices in and through which persons are oriented to issues of what's real, true, genuine and so forth. Further- more, it adopts a 'family resemblance' view of reality analysis. In other words, there can be as many different kinds of reality analysis as there are occasions on which persons engage in the activities of reporting, question- ing, interpreting, deciding and explaining what is or is not the case, what is truth and what error, lies or fiction, what is 'real' and what is not- in whatever locally relevant senses these distinctions are employed. Socio- logical theorizing about reality is, then, a species of members' practical action and practical reasoning with respect to what is real or unreal, true or false, believable or unbelievable, and so forth. Just as sociologists theo- rize about how or why persons come to believe what they do, or 'see' the world in particular ways, so also do 'ordinary' members of society. The grounds of belief and disbelief, judgments of what is the case or not, argu- ments about what happened or didn't 'really' happen, and so forth, are everyday, routine matters for members of society. Despite the pervasiveness of reality analysis, remarkably little attention has been paid to it. One major exception is the work of Pollner (1974, 1975, 1987); his empirical studies of practical, 'mundane' reasoning in traffic courts and other settings are highly detailed and insightful investigations of how participants to those settings engage in locally relevant 'reality analy- sis'. Unfortunately, these studies are vitiated by just the kind of construc- tionist theorizing described above. From a descriptive explication of the local accomplished orderliness of these activities, Pollner extrapolates to a 'larger' issue, recruiting members and their local practices to the service of the 'self-preservation of mundane reason'. Thereby, he turns the notion of 'mundane reason' from a label for certain kinds of members' practices into an ediJ2ce. Members' activities consist in the defense of this edifice; this is what their reality analysis, in courtrooms and similar settings reaUy amounts to.3 In this respect, Pollner's analysis of mundane reason duplicates the ironic treatment of members' understandings which we have already noted with respect to realism and social constructionism. In contrast, from our</page><page sequence="4">98 Stephen Hester and David Francis ethnomethodological point of view, such activities are treated as neither ontologically significant nor epistemologically momentous - they are of interest simply because they are practical, socially organized activities in which members engage. Ethnomethodology's interest in the organization of practical action and practical reasoning takes a diversity of forms (Maynard and Clayman 1991). Our particular ethnomethodological approach draws mainly on the work of Sacks (1992a, 1992b), and especially his studies of the organization of membership categories, and the common sense connections between cat- egories and activities, as these are made available and constituted in the local contexts of their actual use.4 ANALYSING A CLASSROOM STORYI8ELLING In this paper we propose to bring these ethnomethodological interests in reality-as-a-members'-phenomenon to bear upon the examination of a par- ticular corpus of data, namely a transcription and tape recording of a story, told by a teacher to a class of 6 year olds in a school classroom. The story is entitled 'The Dazzle' by Edna O'Brien ( 1981).5 In analysing these materials, our view is that the 'text' is inseparable from the social contexts of its 'telling'; there can be no 'text' in itself; independent of the occasion of its reading, writing, listening, telling, understanding and so on. What a 'text' is, what it 'means', what its 'central themes' are, etc. are members' practi- cal accomplishments in specific local environments.6 Our interest, then, is in what the parties to this storytelling 'make of' the text-as-told at various points in its collaborative telling. Our methodological strategy is to focus not on the decontextualized 'text' of the story, but on the talk between the the teacher and children which is occasioned by its telling. Thus, at specific points in the storytelling, the children are invited to comment upon the story in ways which display their understanding of it. In particular, they are invited to make observations about the problems experienced by the story's 'central character', in the form of suggestions, advice, etc. Additionally, the children occasionally volunteer 'analyses' of such events. The extracts which we consider in detail contain examples of both invited and volun- teered contributions. In each of these the parties to the storytelling engage in what we have called 'reality analysis'. Constraints on the length of this paper preclude inclusion of the full tran- script of the storytelling. Therefore, at this point, purely for the practical purpose of orienting the reader to those extracts which we consider in detail, we offer the following summary of the story. We recognize, of course, that this summary is itself a locally occasioned practical accomplishment and therefore we emphasize that we do not presume that it is a summary that any of the parties to this storytelling might make. Thus, our reading is that the story centres around a central character, a 'little boy' called 'Tim', who experiences a series of troubles which are eventually resolved by means</page><page sequence="5">Reality analysis in a classroom storytelling 99 of the 'Dazzle'. The story has three 'scenes'. The first takes place in Tim's bedroom and relates the troubles he has in getting to sleep at night due to the noise made by various 'talking objects' (for example, the curtains, the pictures, the jug and bowl). The second scene occurs 'downstairs' where Tim is taken by his parents after a storm damages the roof and causes a leak into his bedroom. The action in the third scene begins in the 'boxroom' into which Tim is moved temporarily while the roof is repaired. In this scene Tim meets a talking mouse who is in possession of a 'magic light', called the 'Dazzle'. Tim is afraid of the dark downstairs. The mouse per- suades Tim to venture downstairs and shows him how with the help of the 'Dazzle' there is nothing to be afraid of. Analysing the reportabilit of experience In what follows we focus our attention on some instances of reality analysis in the talk which is 'touched off by the events in the first scene of the story. The storytelling begins with what might be called 'scene setting'. This involves the identification of the central character of the story, 'Tim', his categorial co-identification with the story recipients, description of a 'problem' experienced by Tim, and, most significantly for our purposes here, the use of a contrast class comprising the ordinary and the extra- ordinary.7 Specifically, it is a contrast between ordinary and extraordinary reasons why a child might find it 'hard to get to sleep'. (1) T So we'll see what this one's about. It's called the Dazzle ((s.v.)) right, now and the little boy's in bed at night () now this little boy's in bed and every girl and every boy knows how hard it is to get to sleep sometimes. Sometimes it's raining and the rain- drops go pit pat, pit pat. Or then a ((r.v.)) bi::g () plop of rain falls into the big barrel outside. Sometimes it's windy and there's gales coming down the chimney and rattling the windows. C1: What's gales? T: What's a gale? C2: ( (r.v. ) ) Wind T: A really big wind, yes or sometimes there's a big moon in the sky and it doesn't matter how tight you close those curtains (2.0) C3: ( (s.v.) ) Some light = T: = Some light, yes, that's right Kevin, some light comes shining into the room (2.0) and sometimes well if it's thunder and light- ning that's the worst, it's ever so scary, anything can happen (3.0) a tree could blow down, perhaps a chimney pot might blow down and there's a terrible noise and you can't get to sleep at all (2.0) Tim knew all about these things ( (s.v.) ) but there was something far worse that stopped him getting to sleep ()</page><page sequence="6">100 Stephen Hester and David Francis | there's l the = Lthe moon] T: = bedroom look there's Tim in bed. Now, everything in Tim's room spoke = C5: it's sun bright T: = How they spoke. They talked and talked and they got on his nerves. The trouble with them was (1.5) they only spoke when Tim was alone in his bedroom. Every night, night after night (1.5) he could hear the voices speaking, and of course, if mum and dad came in they would stop. Thus, the 'normal problem' of getting to sleep is explicated in terms of 'frightening things'. Among the collection, 'good reasons for children's insomnia', 'being frightened' is perhaps archetypal. As incumbents of the membership category 'child', both story recipients and Tim can be expected to have knowledge of the sorts of things that are involved in bedtime fears, things like those the storyteller has listed. In other words, such knowledge can be heard as a predicate of the membership category 'child'. But Tim's situation is not just a 'normal' one. Thus, the storyteller identifies the special nature of Tim's experience by contrasting routine grounds for insomnia with 'something far worse' with which he has to contend. This is the problem that 'everything in Tim's room spoke'. Tim has to listen to their talking and their chatter 'got on his nerves'. Following this opening 'scene-setting' segment of the story, the teacher asks a question and a pupil answers it. When a second pupil then suggests a way of dealing with the troublesome objects, the teacher follows up this 'suggestion' with an agreement and a positive evaluation. Both of these adjacency pairs (Sacks, Schegloff andJefferson 1974) exhibit reality analy- sis. The transcript is as follows (2) T: The trouble with them was (1.5) they only spoke when Tim was alone in his bedroom every night, night after night (1.5) he could hear voices speaking and of course if mum and dad came in thenJ would stop (0.5) do you think people would believe him? C1: No. C2: His mum and dad would have to sit there all night to make them not talk. T: Yes they would wouldn't they, that's a good idea. Our interest at this point is in the first of these two adjacency pairs con- tained in this extract. Thus, the teacher's question ('do you think people would believe him?') and the child's answer to it ('no') can be heard to address the issue of the believabilit of Tim's experience. This issue, further- more, is linked to the repartabilit of that experience. In what follows we shall explicate how the teacher's question exhibits reality analysis. In doing this, we shall consider firstly the method whereby recognizability of these events</page><page sequence="7">Reality analysis in a classroom storytelling 101 as extraordinary is accomplished, and secondly how the issues of believ- ability and reportability are occasioned by features of the storytelling, including the 'extraordinariness' of the events described. Recognizably extraordinary occurrences We note that the extraordinary character of the events is a reading or finding on our part and we emphasize that the text does not state, in so many words, that what is depicted there is 'extraordinary'. However, we take it that the 'extraordinary' character of the talking objects is readily recog- nizable by the reader, just as it is for us and the children in the class as recip- ients of the story. Such recognizable extraordinariness trades upon commonsense knowledge of everyday objects and their properties. It is accomplished, in particular, in and through a method we call predicate switching In this context, this method involves the attribution of activities predicated of humans to ordinary inanimate objects, thereby making them 'extraordinary'. This is evident in the following extract (3) T: No sooner had mum gone downstairs than they were off gain, 'yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap'. Tim would take his little silver torch from under the pillow and shine it on them, and say 'look at the mess you got me into', but nobody pitied him at all (1.5) the curtains would shrug (1.5) and the curtain rings started to laugh and tinkle together. Nobody cared, they were all too busy arguing (0.5) another thing, they all wanted to be boss, they had terrible arguments (0.5) the wash basin and the jug they argued over who should hold the water (1.5) the jug said ( (r.v.) ) 'you hold the wretched water, it's far too heavy', the basin would reply ((r.v) ) 'no, I will not, not until the morning silly, I'm not going to hold that water 'til they wash' () then the toothbrush would say 'I fancy toothpaste that tastes of raspber- ries, my mouth's dry' and the towel | would l= C: Lheh-heh]-heh T: = then say something like 'whoosh, whoosh'. Tim liked the towel best because it didn't do him any harm and he was a bit dopey. Although the objects have an extraordinary, 'anthropomorphic' charac- ter, their behaviour is consistent with their properties as objects. On the one hand, they are the sorts of objects that might normally and properly be found in a bedroom: pictures, curtains, a vase, a basin. On the other hand, however, they have capabilities that such objects do not ordinarily possess: they can talk and, as we subsequently discover, they possess a number of other 'anthropomorphic' personality characteristics predicated on this ability. The basin and jug, for example, 'argue' about which of them should hold the water, the curtains 'shrug' and 'laugh' and the towel makes a 'whooshing' sound. Their extraordinariness thus consists in them 'coming</page><page sequence="8">102 Stephen Hester and David Francis alive', turning from inanimate objects into animate ones, while retaining their recognizable features as the kinds of objects they are. Furthermore, the objects in Tim's bedroom do more than just talk and argue. Some of them 'come to life' in even more extraordinary ways (4) T: Big picture frame above his bed (0.5) can you see (1.5) there's a picture of a tall man with high boots and a funny fur hat and a flashing sword in his hand. C1: Oh! T: What do you think he is? C2: A soldier T: A soldier| yes you see, l well he started to talk = C3: LWith a sword] T: = you could hear him as far away as Timbuktu, he had ever such a loud voice. He was very cross and he would shout out ( (r.v.) ) 'cha:::rge' () all over the bedroom (0.5) sometimes his colour changed and he got so:: mad he was shouting he looked like a beetroot. Although the objects behave in recognizably extraordinary ways, they do so only, as we have seen, when Tim is alone. When his parents are present, they stop talking. It is this state of afEairs which provides the issue of believ- ability within the story. It is to this issue that we now turn. Seeing and believing The issue of believability is raised and addressed in the exchange contained in the following extract (5) T: The trouble with them was (1.5) they only spoke when Tim was alone in his bedroom every night, night after night (1.5) he could hear voices speaking and of course if mum and dad came in they would stop (0.5) do you think people would believe him? C1: No. We take it that the teacher's question is occasioned by the difficulties Tim faces within the story. Not only is he prevented from getting to sleep by the talking objects, but his efforts to quieten them create further problems because when his parents come to investigate the disturbance, the objects cease to speak. Thus, Tim's parents can only have Tim's repart of these events. Tim does not actually provide such a report but the teacher asks whether 'people would believe him' were he to do so. 'Parents', after all, are the relevant category of persons to whom an incumbent of the member- ship category 'little boy' is entitled to turn in the event that he has problems in getting to sleep.8 Since the objects 'stop talking' when the parents enter, there is a discrepancy between what Tim experiences and what his parents are able to see. It is this discrepancy which hearably furnishes the grounds for the teacher's question, 'do you think people would believe him?' There</page><page sequence="9">Realit analysis in a classroom storytelling 103 are, however, at least three ways of understanding this discrepancy and thus the character of the teacher's reality analysis at this point. A first possible hearing is that the teacher is invoking the notion of 'per- spective'. From Tim's perspective, the talking objects are 'real', but since his parents cannot 'see' or 'hear' them, then Tim might not be believed. The issue of believability would seem to be tied, on the one hand, then, to matters of 'taking someone's word for it', taking reports at face value, and on the other hand, to the matter of 'seeing is believing'. The answer which is implied by the teacher's question is that they might not believe Tim if they had not had the experiences themselves. Since the talking objects stop talkingwhenever Tim's parents come into the bedroom, they cannot hear this for themselves. Therefore Tim has a problem of believability; in the absence of first hand experience, his parents are unlikely to take his word for what he claims. However, the believability of a reported experience is not just tied to whether or not recipients of reports have also witnessed the reported events. A second possibility involves the category relations between reporter and report-recipient. Rights to have accounts treated as objective and bona fide are asymmetrical in respect of the membership categories 'child' and 'adult'.9 Where a child reports something extraordinary, it is available to adults to dismiss such claims as products of 'childhood imagination', exag- geration, and so forth. Adults can and do distinguish between what chil- dren say they have seen and what they may actually have experienced. Where there is a disjunction between what children say and what can be seen by adults it may properly be taken that the real is in the seeing, not the saying. Accordingly, the teacher can be heard to invoke such categorical asymmetries in her question, thus implying that Tim might not be believed because he is a child. A third possible analysis concerns the character of the matter being reported; there are differences between the reportability of ordinary and extraordinary events. As Sacks (1984) has pointed out with reference to 'doing being ordinary', the ordinariness of experience resides in its char- acter as 'something which can happen to anyone'. In the case of this story- telling it is the extraordinariness of the events which makes them out as not 'something which can happen to anyone' and hence inhibits Tim from reporting them. In turn, it is this 'non-tellability' which makes it problem- atic that he would be believed if his parents were confronted only with his verbal account of the 'talking objects' and were unable to experience them for themselves. Tim could be disbelieved because his parents were not co-witness to the events he could report, or because of his incumbency of the membership category 'child' (and hence the attribution of predicates such as 'imagina- tive', 'fanciful', etc.), or because of the 'extraordinary' character of the events reported, or some combination of these three. Whatever its analytic grounds, the teacher's question about believability is immediately followed by the answer 'no' from one of the children. We cannot be sure how this</page><page sequence="10">104 Stephen Hester and David Francis child has understood the question. However, in answering 'no', the child can at least be heard to recognize that the issue of believability is being raised. We now turn to the second adjacency pair, which consists of a suggestion and an agreement/evaluation (6) C2: His mum and dad would have to sit there all night to make them not talk. T: Yes they would wouldn't they, that's a good idea. This child's suggestion is formulated not with respect to the issue of believ- ability but rather in terms of the practical problern of dealing with the talking objects. The suggestion takes its cue from the reality of the story's events for its central character; from Tim's point of view, the talking objects are factual. Such factuality is, of course, story-specific. However, as Sacks (1992b: 474) has pointed out in his analysis of the telling of a 'dirty joke', where a story depicts 'unbelievable' happenings, recipients take their orientation to such events as events-for-the-purpose-of-the-story from the orientation which is taken to them by relevant characters within the story. Thus, in this case, the central character, Tim, does not question the 'reality' of his experience, but accepts the behaviour of the objects in his bedroom, their arguments, shouting, aggressive conduct and so forth, as adequate grounds for practi- cal action, such as telling them to 'Be quiet!'. Tim's orientation provides the recipients with an indication as to the proper orientation that they should take. The child's suggestion also assumes that the problem can be treated like any other children's problem, namely that it can be solved by the parents - the child selects 'mum and dad' as appropriate persons to deal with the problem. This category analysis provides for and is reflexively constituted by the suggestion he makes. The child's suggestion thus embodies a cat- egory analysis and a reality analysis in which the problem is treated as real and capable of being solved through an ordinary course of action. The teacher's agreement and positive evaluation of this suggestion confirms not only the child's reality analysis but his category analysis as well. Dreaming and beang awake As the storytelling unfolds, the problem of the talking objects takes on a further dimension. Tim's efforts to quieten the objects are overheard by his parents - they can hear Tim's voice even though they cannot hear the talking of the objects. (7) T: Tim could be heard talking sometimes, and he would say strange things he would be saying 'Oh pipe down picture, stop talking that Indian vase, do be quiet that basin', he | got so carried l away he shouted. C: L heh-heh-heh-heh]</page><page sequence="11">Realit analysts in a classroom storytelling 105 T: ((r.v.)) 'Be quiet' () and his mother would come upstairs and open the door and say 'Timothy, are you all right?' and of course as soon as she came in = C: = they stopped = T: = Yes, they stopped Steven, and everything was quiet. Therefore, Tim's problem is not simply to find a way of dealing with the objects by himself, it also involves the accountable character of his own talk, as overheard by his parents. In this respect story recipients might find Tim to be in a 'double bind'; his interaction with the talking objects creates the additional problem of accounting for his own behaviour to his parents. The solution which Tim adopts is told in the following extract. (8) T: Tim had to close his eyes and let on that he was just talking in hissleep (1.5) 'Oh dear' hismotherFwouldsay l= C: Lheh-heh-heh l T: = 'I think that boy's eaten too many crab apples today, perhaps he's got a tummy ache giving him nightmares'. Thus, Tim solves his problem by 'pretending' to be asleep and thereby permitting his parents to infer that he was having a nightmare and talking in his sleep. Tim's solution can be seen to invoke a contrast between dream- ing and being awake. By 'pretending' to be asleep while his mother enters the bedroom, Tim provides an account for what his parents have heard; they are able to 'see' that he is talking in his sleep. Talking in one's sleep is acceptable but being awake and talking back to 'real objects' that others cannot hear is not. Dreaming and being awake, as Schutz (1964) noted, constitute alternative and distinct realities. What happens in one is not gov- erned by the constraints of what can happen in the other. This distinction provides Tim with a means for resolving what might otherwise be a 'reality disjuncture' (Pollner 1974) between himself and his parents, a means by which his experience with the 'talking objects' can be squared with his parents' experience of hearing his voice coming from the bedroom. The reality disjuncture is avoided by the boy offering grounds to his parents which would explain his shouts in terms of their reality, and not in terms of his reality. Our interest is in the teacher's and the children's responses to this part of the story, which are evident in the following extract. (9) T: A soldierFyes you see, 1 well he started to talk = C: LWith a sword.] T: = you could hear him as far away as Timbuktu, he had ever such a loud voice. He was very cross and he would shout out ( (r.v.) ) 'cha:::rge' () all over the bedroom (0.5) sometimes his colour changed and he got so:: mad he was shouting he looked like a beetroot. T: Tim thought (2.0) I hope he doesn't get a fit or nobody's going to be safe (3.0) just in case he decided to fall on top of him Tim</page><page sequence="12">106 Stephen Hester and David Francis decided that he would duck down under the blanket and pull the big eiderdown over his head (1.5) C: ( ) T: So that he would be safe. (2.0) C2: There's nothing wrong it's just a dre::am. T: Do you think he's dreaming Sam? C3 NO. C4 NO. C5: NO. C6: _NO._ C7 NO. T: | He'l ll see, wo- n't he? C8 LNO.J C9 NO._ C10: _NO._ C11: It's not | real. l T: Lwe::llJchhmm. C12: ( ) C13 ( ) T: There was o::ne Our focus firstly is on the child's utterance 'there's nothing wrong, it's just a dream'. We consider the reality analysis which is observable in this utterance. We then discuss the teacher's question, 'do you think he's dreaming Sam?' and the responses that this question elicits from other children in the class. Finally, we analyse the child's utterance 'it's not real'. The child's utterance, 'there's nothing wrong, it's just a dream', can be heard as occasioned by the immediately preceding events in the story. By virtue of its local placement, a possible hearing of this utterance is that the child is offering reassurance to Tim. Thus, Tim is portrayed as frightened by the behaviour of the soldier. A conventional response to another's expression of fear is reassurance. Such reassurance can take a variety of forms, including (a) an assertion of 'shared fear', and (b) an assertion that 'there is nothing to be afraid of'. These might be called Type A and Type B reassurance forms. The use of Type A reassurance is problematic in relation to fears associ- ated with dreams. Since dreams are individual experiences which cannot be co-experienced, one may not intelligibly say to a person who reports a bad dream or nightmare that 'It's OKf it scared me too'. It is possible to assert similaritw of experience, by stating that one has also had frightening dreams, but such an assertion may not in itself accomplish reassurance. In contexts where experiences are shared, however, Type A reassurance can be done intelligibly. For example, a first soldier might say in the course of battle,</page><page sequence="13">107 Realifw analysis in a classroom storytelling 'I'm scared', and it would be reasonable and plausible for a second soldier to then say, 'So am I', thereby 'sharing the reality'. Whereas Type A reassurance works by recognizing the source of the fear as real and objective, such that experience of can be intersubjective, Type B reassurance works by denying the reality of the fear's source. Although dream experiences can be vivid and convincing, once it is acknowledged that they were indeed dream experiences their 'reality status' is relevant for how they should be responded to. As adequate grounds for inferences and actions, they are not treatable as equivalent to wide-awake experiences.l° The child's remark can be heard to invoke this commonsense principle, adherence to which will dispel the troubles occasioned by mistaking dreams for reality. In this way, hearably, the remark does 'reassuring Tim'. Further- more, in suggesting 'it's only a dream. . . ', the child can also be heard to employ a standard method of reassurance which parents use to comfort their children when they have 'bad dreams' and 'nightmares'. We now consider the teacher's response to the pupil's volunteered comment. In saying 'do you think he's dreaming, Sam', the teacher can be heard to treat the child's remark as expressing a point of view. The question is interactionally consequential in two further ways. First, in that it is explicitly addressed to 'Sam', it provides the child an opportunity to modify, or confirm the reality analysis he has asserted. Second, in that it topicalizes the issue of the correct reality analysis of the events in the story, the teacher's questioning of Sam's version without committing herself to an alternative, opens up the issue for debate. By virtue of the fact that the story- telling is a collective occasion ('Sam' being just one member of the collec- tivity (to which the story is being told), the teacher's utterance provides an opportunity for others to offer their own reality analyses. The rest of the class recognizably analyse the teacher's utterance in this way, as evidenced by their collective, chorus-like response. The chorus of 'no' which the teacher's question elicits indicates general disagreement with the reality analysis of the story given by Sam. We noted above that Sam's remark could be heard as a point of view and as endorsing the parent's orientation rather than Tim's. The responses of the other children can be heard as countering this by affiliating with Tim's orientation. If Sam can be heard as 'siding' with the parents, the other children, in rejecting Sam's view, in effect side with Tim on the reality of the 'talking objects'. Following the chorus of 'no', another child says 'it's not real'. It is not clear whether this remark is a reiteration of the previous child's statement that 'it's just a dream' or whether he is saying that the whole thing, the story itself, is fictional and therefore not real, and need not therefore be taken seriously. In other words, this child might be heard as 'siding with Sam', agreeing with his reality analysis of the events in the story and disagreeing with the views expressed by the other children who have responded in chorus to the teacher's question. However, the reality analysis here may be of a different order - it could be heard as a reminder to aU those who have expressed a view about the events in the story that this is, after all 'just a</page><page sequence="14">108 Stephen Hester and David Francis story'. Since this remark is neither developed by the speaker nor taken up by any other participant, there are no grounds upon which we can do more than simply note these two possibilities. We have sought to describe some ways in which members engage in 'reality analysis' upon a specific occasion - the telling of a children's story. With respect to our examination of these materials, we wish to draw atten- tion to two concluding considerations. First, the teacher's questions and the children's responses comprising their reality analyses are produced at par- ticular junctures or points in the storytelling. They are placed with respect to the local historicity of the story. The events within the story comprise resources internal to the storytelling which provide for the responses to it. This is what we mean when we say that their reality analyses are 'touched off' by the events in the storytelling. Secondly, the intelligibility of those questions and responses, like the behaviour of the story characters, is grounded in the 'reality' of everyday life. Issues of believability, of fear of the dark, of having bad dreams and being reassured about them, are every- day issues manifested in this particular storytelling. Furthermore, the chil- dren as well as the teacher demonstrate a competence in understanding and addressing such issues. This competence includes an appreciation of, and an ability to discern, the categorically configured and contextually embedded character of questions of the real, the unreal, the believable, and so forth. Reality analysis is therefore accomplished both locally and with reference to the 'routine grounds of everyday life'. CONCLUSION In the introduction we contrasted ethnomethodological interest in members 'reality analysis' with the theoretical conceptions of social reality assumed by realist and constructionist sociologists. We suggested that the key difference is that ethnomethodology eschews the notion that socio- logical inquiries need to be grounded in some theory of 'social reality'. Not only is such a theory unnecessary but it also serves to create obstacles in the way of a clear sighted examination of members' everyday practices. The notion that sociological inquiries need to be grounded in theory, whether of a realist or a social constructionist variety, inevitably results in the rep- resentation of members' activities as theoretical instantiations; members' practices are of interest only insofar as they provide a means to solve the analyst's problems (Garfinkel 1956). In both cases, the examination of member's practices is conducted under the auspices of an epistemological problem of the nature of 'reality in general'. The 'reality' problem in sociological theory is a philosophical problem which sociology has appropriated. We note in this regard that the theor- etical bias of philosophy in respect of the notion of reality has been power- fully and effectively criticized by Austin (1962) and Wittgenstein (1974), both of whom argue that a clear sighted view of the everyday uses of notions</page><page sequence="15">Reality analysis in a classroom storytelling 109 such as 'real', 'true', 'fact' and so forth has the effect of dissolvingclassical philosophical problems. Thus, Austin notes that 'real' is a 'problem' word in the sense that its use is occasioned by and marks an issue concerning the status of some object, event, experience, etc. What is at issue in question- ing whether something is 'real' depends on whether the contrast is between the 'real' and the 'fake', the 'real' and the 'imaginary', the 'real' and the 'apparent' and so forth, where each of these contrasts takes its specific sense from its local context of use.ll The difference between the philosophical approach of Austin and Wittgenstein and that of the mainstream tradition of western philosophy which they criticize is reflected in the contrast we have drawn between ethnomethodology and mainstream sociology (whether of a realist c)r social constructionist persuasion). Furthermore, in speaking of reality as a members' phenomenon, we are not talking about 'general theories of reality' which members might possess nor do we believe that members need to have such general theories in order to conduct their everyday affairs. Similarly, attitudes of generalized scepticism and relativism such as are currently fashionable within sociological thought (Bauman 1992) are unintelligible outside the confines of the theoretical endeavours of soci- ology and philosophy. As we have sought to show, persons occasionally, and in specific ways, do question whether something is 'real', 'unreal', 'true', 'false', 'imaginary', 'hallucinatory' and so forth. However, we do not con- ceive of members as having a problem with the 'realness' of things in general, but rather as having an occasioned concern with the realness of just these things, those to hand in the local circumstances of their practical actions. Thus, when we speak of 'reality analysis' we refer to the multi- tudinous and locally occasioned, embedded and embodied ways in which the irealness' of things is topicalized by members. In everyday life, members encounter problems of 'reality' and 'realness' as mundane, routine and ordinary problems for which, much of the time at least, there are mundane, routine and ordinary solutions. The approach of ethno- methodology seeks to respect the status such matters have for members and encourages sociology not to make ontological mountains out of every- day molehills.

By varieties of realism we refer to such sociological stances as Marxism, Neo- Marxism, Durkheimianism and Neo-func- tionalism. A useful discussion of realism in social science is Sayer (1984). 2. We recognize that 'social construc- tionism' is a label which has somewhat different meanings in different intellectual contexts, since it covers a variety of approaches across several fields of inquiry in the contemporary social sciences. The description that follows seeks only to outline some general notions which are more or less common to social construc- tionist studies across a number of fields. The relevant literature is now vast and cannot be summarized here; for more specific discussions of social construction- ist ideas as these apply within particular disciplinary fields, see Miller and Holstein (1993) (on social problems theory), Pick- ering ( 1992) (on the sociology of scientific knowledge), Gergen (1985) (on social psy- chology) and Clifford and Marcus (1986) (on ethnography). A broadly based set of discussions of social constructionism is to be found in the special issue of History of the Human Sciences ( 1994). For a detailed critique of social constructionist assumw tions, see Button and Sharrock (1993). 3. For a powerful critique of the assumptions underlying Pollner's analysis of 'mundane reason', see Bogen (1990). 4. See Hester (1994) and Hester and Eglin (1996) for discussion of contextual- ized (ethnomethodological) and decon- textualized approaches to membership categorization analysis. 5. That the book is a 'story book for chil- dren' intended to be read either by chil- dren themselves or by adults to children - is available to be found in a number of ways - not simply the 'content' of the story but also its physical appearance and visual layout, including the many large colour illustrations that accompany the text. For how these illustrations are employed in this particular story telling, enabling its col- laborative accomplishment by the teacher and the children, see Hester and Francis (1995). 6. We recognize that this stance is taken not only in ethnomethodology, but is also evident in some forms of contemporary literary and aesthetic analysis, e.g. Fish (1989). Within ethnomethodology, the</page><page sequence="17">lll Reality analysis in a classroom storytelling classic statement of this view is Garfinkel (1967). See also Watson and Seiler (1992). 7. See Sacks (1992a) for studies in con- versational 'class analysis' and, in particu- lar, the use of contrast classes. 8. See Sacks ( 1972) on 'standardized relational pairs'. In this part of the story, the standardized relational pair (SRP) - parent-child - is used to construct Tim's problem with the objects. Thus, the unavailability of the parents points to the relevance of the standardized relational pair, 'R', 'parent-child' for this occasion. The unavailability of such 'intimates' has been shown to comprise adequate grounds for the conclusion that suicidal persons 'have no one to turn to'. In respect of this story, because of the noticeable absence of the parents, recipients can have an emotional engagement and identification with Tim which is rooted in the entitle- ments and obligations of this SRP. 9. For further discussion of 'asymmetry' in relation to membership categorization, seeJayyusi (1984). 10. We recognize, of course, that the relationship between that which is experi- enced in dreams and the 'wide-awake world of daily life' (Schutz 1964) is often a matter of specific practical theorizing. Such theorizing may be conducted under a variety of auspices, including Freudian psychoanalysis, Christian eschatology and other belief systems. Such theorizing often is culturally specific; in some cultures dream experiences are routinely treatable as providing adequate grounds for infer- ences and actions. See, for example, Watson and Goulet's account of the Dene Tha people of northern Alberta (Watson and Goulet, 1992) and the discussion of this by Francis (1994). 11. In contrast to ethnomethodogy, despite their appreciation of the em- beddedness of all language use in local contexts of use, both Wittgenstein and Austin relied in their investigations on 'remembered' and invented examples rather than on empirical studies of actual use. This constitutes a limitation of their analyses. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ashmore, M. (1989) The Refexive Thesis, Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Austin, J.
