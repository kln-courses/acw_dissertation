<plain_text><page sequence="1">Drawing on interdisciplinary work on the significance of cultural artefacts by scholars such as Bill Brown and W.J.T. Mitchell, this essay explores images of things in Komunyakaa's recent mythopoetic verse while connecting this motif to the thingness of poetry itself, the latent and insistent force of its rhythmic form. Dying Objects/Living Things: The Thingness of Poetry in Yusef Komunyakaa's Talking Dirty to the Gods DANIEL CROSS TURNER I knew that I wanted it to take on what I thought of as small things within the context of the universe , and how those things illuminate larger ideas, larger moments of perception. Really ; I wanted to write trib- ute poems to smaller things. - Yusef Komunyakaa , "Remaking Myth in Yusef Komunyakaa's Talking Dirty to the Gods , Taboo, and Gilgamesh: An Interview " Yusef import concern Komunyakaas of with smaller the things poetic larger concern with the larger import of smaller things coincides with the emergence over the last decade of critical interest in thingness and material culture, crossing dis- ciplines from anthropology to economics to art history to philosophy and literary criticism. Theories of thingness and objecthood centre on how extensively and inten- sively inanimate things can influence social relationships and even express forms of agency within and beyond cultural systems. This attention to the power of things to shape the human world is vital to Talking Dirty to the Gods , a collection of poems that departs from Komunyakaa's long concern with engaging the historical traumas of racism and combat.1 In this volume, he creates a new mode of mythopoesis, a tran- scultural synthesis of ancient deities with the proliferating gods flooding modernity through contemporary mythologies of science, media, late capitalism, and politics.2 Mosaic 45/1 0027- 1276-07/1 370 18$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">138 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) This essay concentrates less on the daunting diversity of subject matter in Komunyakaa's volume than on its engagement with what Bill Brown has termed the "object matter" of literature, the ways in which texts invoke the physical presence of things to unveil "the phenomenal object world through which human subjects circu- late" ( Sense 18). What is striking yet largely unmentioned by critics is Komunyakaas intense concentration on things themselves through poems that lay bare the means by which nonhuman things affect the individual and social experiences of human sub- jects. Komunyakaas poems ask us to examine smaller things in relation to the vol- ume's unique form of "gut-level realism," which provides a visceral transcendence through knowing confrontation with the presence and pressures of things, with the material world "in all of its fearful certainty" (Turner 343). 3 Brown describes the crucial distinction between objects and things, explaining that an object can function as a window into human culture, for "we look through objects because there are codes by which our interpretive attention makes them meaningful, because there is a discourse of objectivity that allows us to use them as facts" ("Thing" 4). We convert the rawness of things into the relative tractability of objects when we name them and put them to use within our own networks of mean- ing and exchange. By contrast, we must face the lingering thingness of objects "when they stop working for us: when the drill breaks, when the car stalls, when the windows get filthy, when their flow within the circuits of production and distribution, consump- tion and exhibition, has been arrested, however momentarily. The story of objects asserting themselves as things, then, is the story of how the thing really names less an object than a particular subject-object relation" (4). Thingness embodies a return of the repressed, of uncontained material presence striking against abstract social modes of value. Moving beyond a Marxist critique of the fetishization of otherwise valueless and transient objects, this essay focuses on two primary manifestations of thingness in Talking Dirty to the Gods : dying objects , objects in the course of being stripped of their significance vis-à-vis human subjectivity, as their status as commodities is in the process of being interrupted and corrupted so that their resolute thingness, their fractious irreducibility to circuits of human use and exchange, seizes our attention; and living things , things of nature - plants, animals, and human/nonhuman hybrids - that take on a totemie aura, serving as unkind reminders of our kinship with other species. In things, examining seeing the the thingness truculence, of even dying vengeance objects, we of watch things made against things their become human mad pos- things, seeing the truculence, even vengeance of things against their human pos- sessors, which brings to mind the depths of our interdependence on things as well as</page><page sequence="3">Daniel Cross Turner 139 our own thingness. This pattern of artefacts coming undone thus speaks to cultural matters, to how things are made subject to historical formulations, yet also exceed and even reconstitute social codings. Once a thing is named, "it is assimilated into the terms of the human subject at the same time that it is opposed to it as object, an oppo- sition that is indeed necessary for the subject's separation and definition," and yet there always remains "an unknowable otherness to the thing" (Schwenger 101). Traditional faith in the human power of creation and naming, of seemingly godlike consciousness and will made manifest in our command of artifice and language, is put under severe trial. Things made to our order threaten to unmake us in their image; as objects fall apart, things come alive. In "The God of Broken Things," one of Komunyakaa s modern deities is discov- ered among a clatter of dying objects in a purgatorial junk shop, "a lopsided heaven" (71). He endeavours to reanimate these discarded materials, the detritus of now bro- ken circuits of consumption, into the life of things: He's in a lopsided heaven at Maggie's Júnk Shop. Objects of wóod, iron, ivory, Of venéer, lead, stóne, glass, flimsy Cardboard, of tin, brass, brónze ... (71)4 Not unlike Brown's analysis of modernist photographer Paul Strand's "Abstraction - Bowls," the broken things in Komunyakaa's poem have equally been stripped of asso- ciations, which enables them "to achieve a formalism that obfuscates any exchange or use value that the objects may have" ( Sense 9). This process transforms them into "both something less (fragments) than the objects they were, but also something more (forms), discovering a kind of thingness obscured by their everyday use as objects" (9). Undone commodities, these pieces of junk shed past codes of instru- mental use and become unfathomable things, a regression/progression that is self- reflexively paralleled by the lines' own rhythmic process. We experience the thingness of rhythm forcefully imprinted in the heavily stressed discontinuous stream of things set before us, as each and every thing is accented (wood, iron, ivory, venéer, lead, stóne, glass, cardboard, tin, brass, brónze). The material intensity of each inflected word/thing foregrounds the thingness of things, the lost conceptually of these unmade artefacts yielding to the (re) found substance of these almost elemental things. Although one might assume that the purpose of the God of Broken Things is to repair these obsolete objects and return them to normal paths of exchange, his end- less work of mending goes on to no certain end. While he "could go on forever fixing / Cracks, fissures, dents, fractures" (71), the specific results of his labour remain</page><page sequence="4">140 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) obscure. No recognizable object is produced - he goes on forever fixing, but nothing gets fixed. Things are clearly weighted towards impasse over completion, mere parts without regard to any whole, something reemphasized by the poem's lopsided rhythms: the things that engulf ruined objects - "Cracks, fissures, dénts, fractures" - are all rhythmically underscored. The God of Broken Things's efforts unveil two of the ways thingness is not recu- perable in objects, summoning both the latency and excessiveness of things versus objects as he goes to work Rasping &amp; gluing together what is Unheard of with what can never be Broken or húrt benéath the architecture Of plánned obsolescence. (71) On the one hand, things bear traces of "the amorphousness out of which objects are materialized by the (ap) perceiving subject, the anterior physicality of the physical world emerging, perhaps, as an aftereffect of the mutual constitution of subject and object, a rétroprojection"; on the other, they gesture towards "what exceeds their mere materialization as objects or their mere utilization as objects - their force as a sensu- ous presence or as a metaphysical presence" (Brown, "Thing" 5). The poem gives a sense of "the not yet formed or the not yet formable" (i.e., latent thingness: "what is / Unheard of") that is coextensive with "what remains physically or metaphysically irre- ducible to objects" (i.e., excessive thingness: "what can never be / Broken or hurt") (5). What is literally heard - the insistent power of the lines' unbalanced rhythms - rein- forces the physicality of the words themselves as the rhythmic energy is transferred synaptically across the radically enjambed lineation. Poetic rhythm is the intact archi- tecture beneath the broken architecture of the enjambed lines, the unnameable lan- guage beneath and beyond the poem's language. Brokenness is the primary structuring agent within Maggie's Junk Shop, which betrays the impossibility of cohesive, overar- ching order. The poem then moves beyond this modernist cliché, supplanting it with the lasting truculence of broken things, their petulant persistence to carry on without respect to our plans for them. As things, they outlive and outlast "the architecture / Of planned obsolescence" that late capitalism has designated for its ephemeral objects. The God of Broken Things's sweating over " Objets ďart / &amp; bric-a-brac mended with ratty hemp" (71) implies that objets ďart and bric-a-brac could conceivably be "mended," an unlikelihood since brokenness is part and parcel of these objects them- selves and disintegration is built into their structure initially. How does one fix some- thing that has been crafted to be fragmented? Komunyakaa's poem reverses "the</page><page sequence="5">Daniel Cross Turner 141 modernist anxiety over the collapse of structure" by showing how things themselves outstrip their received forms and in the process expose a more contemporary "panic over uncontrolled growth of structures - cancers, viruses, and other rapidly evolving entities" (Mitchell, "Romanticism" 171). Placed now inside the junk shop, the remains of these designed miscellanies become coreless structures of amalgamation, invoking most fully the acquisitive, heterogeneous nature of modernist bricolage. They have the potential to absorb all things into their continually evolving forms. The ratty hemp is as much a part of them as anything else. The dependence of the human on the nonhuman is evident in the succeeding image, as things become the agents of human affect, conditioning through a mechan- ical yet magical action the emotional and psychological states of their human participant-observer: "The secret space the butterfly / Screw opens wings inside a heart / Made to slip into a dream" (71). The lines perhaps open a pun on complexity theory and the so-called butterfly effect. One thing leads to another in this admixture of death and reanimation, decay and salvage, though we never know precisely where or when, for we can only trace the effects of a system in reverse, after the fact, and then only incompletely. Contra an eschatological model of understanding (narratives of wholeness then decline then death, always in that order), here things reverse them- selves, come back to life, although in no predictable forms. The lines contain another pointed enjambment since, beyond the break, the object is recognized as a useful but- terfly screw. However, this ostensible return to the object's instrumental use gives way immediately to a purely imagined meaning, as the poem shifts from the real into the surreal. The butterfly screw does no reasonable work, but instead opens wings inside a heart that will slip into the ethereal space of a dream. This potentially engenders an associative flow of human consciousness through métonymie resonances. The prag- matic "wings" of a butterfly screw yield to symbolic wings inside a fluttering heart, as in a Dalí painting, where the visual echoes of forms openly slip into one another. The undefined, indefinable "secret space" of thingness exceeds the practiced uses of objects and unlocks possibilities beyond merely human designs. Indeed, some of these métonymie plays appear beyond the poet's outright design. Several of the con- notations sparked by the poem's language seem less conscious allusions than personal associations evoked in readers at a liminal level. In the poem's final moment, the God of Broken Things "browses / Gutted appli- ances, &amp; knows if toenailed / Right a murderous thing is almost new" (71). Komunyakaa uses anthropomorphic language ("gutted" and "toenailed") to describe what happens once human applications have been gutted from worn-out appliances, as if household machines have bodily entrails, human parts. Such imagery implies the</page><page sequence="6">142 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) thingness of human beings and the often unacknowledged connection that humans and things are both made up of parts and subject to reconstitution. The literal mean- ing of "toenailed" - a nail driven obliquely in order to join vertical and horizontal beams - suggests something oblique, off-centred, yet nonetheless "Right," a level of apropos chaos that unfastens modernist anxiety over off-centeredness since there is no longer any centre left to miss. In "The God of Broken Things," one accepts the bro- kenness of things as a proper condition of being. Despite the closing possibility that the deitys labour may create a recommodified object worthy of circulation (though the old thing is only "almost new," not quite fulfilled and, again, there remains ambi- guity over what use it might serve), the murderousness of the thing is what sticks with us. It is only "almost new" from a human perspective; the thing itself is murderous. Hence, the poem concludes with a memorable indication towards granting things intentionality, the capacity to inflict pain on the human subject and take some meas- ure of vengeance against the human world. In "Monkey Wrench," we descend into confrontation with the uncontrolled structures of thingness proliferating beneath the presumably tidy and sterilized intactness of a house proper. This underlying physical space presents another self- reflexive figure for the subterranean architecture of poetic rhythm, the sound patterns pulsing beneath the orderly structures of the poem's abstract sense. Below the house congeals a tangle of "desymbolized objects" that display "a vibrancy that flourishes in the absence of the human" (Lamb 140), as we see things quite literally growing inde- pendent from us, their antipathy towards us once more described in anthropomor- phic language and reiterated through the forceful rhythms flung across the page: Balled into a cócked fist, sûre As a hámmerlóck, the pipe s crácked sléeve Is sealed in corrósion. Élbow Gréase, leverage, ánger, &amp; óil, Nóthing works. (101) The lines create a visceral cacophony through their rapid-fire spondaic beats across monosyllabic phrases (e.g., "cócked fist, sûre," "pipe's crácked sléeve," "Gréase, lever- age"), harsh plosives (repeated "d" and "k" sounds), and a compressed log of things in quick sequence mitigated by merely a single conjunction ("Elbow / Grease, leverage, anger, &amp; oil"). The lines themselves seem overworked, searching for rhythmic leverage against the pressure of the staccato language and presenting a nonverbal allegory for the things' staunch resistance to human will. The useless pipe is "sealed in corrosion,"</page><page sequence="7">Daniel Cross Turner 143 paradoxically arrested in decay. However, what signifies system breakdown to human eyes is, from the view of things, rather the burgeoning of another antithetical struc- ture, the growth of a system of corrosive agents and their inhuman process of ironic preservation. That "Nothing works" implies not merely the failure of human will against these worrisome things, but also the idea that nothingness itself is at work here through the natural process of de- and recomposition. From the human per- spective, no thing is working as it should. Yet "Nothing works" further suggests that the second law of thermodynamics, with its long division of energy towards nothing, is working in the service of things, permitting them to come apart from their status as objects. The obstinacy of things is again cloaked in the guise of personification ("The vise grip / Opens an icy mouth, dribbling / Rusty sighs" [101]); this time we glimpse not the anger, but the indifference of things, their deflation and sheer bore- dom with the human world. At this point, the human speaker - the lyric "I" - enters into the grammar of the poem for the first time, and things seem to be coming under control: I almost give úp, before I see the wrénch própped near a blówtorch Beside the washing machine, inside my head Like an abúsed blessing, awaiting the prómise &amp; caréss of an óily rág. (101) Despite his solace in the instrumental objects that come to his aid, the wrench and the oily rag, there is an unsettling confusion between exteriority and interiority, sensation and cognition, as the wrench appears first as an idea "inside my head / Like an abused blessing." The poem concludes with the persona preparing to go hard at work, yet, as in "The God of Broken Things," we are left in the dark as to whether his labour will prove productive: I lie on my back Benéath the hóuse, among bróken Néhi bóttles, Dóg háir, &amp; insect wings, as if the fórces Have been hard at wórk on a piecemeal ángel Full of Christmas cáke &amp; éggnog, I squint úp At clandestine éyes in a lóom of spiderwebs. (101) As the speaker lies prostrate among the filth, we are met with yet another catalogue of broken things, thickly inflected ("bróken Néhi bóttles, / Dóg háir, &amp; insect wings").</page><page sequence="8">144 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) This reveals a kind of "found" modernist bricolage created without the presence of the mediating will of the artist. This grotesque hybrid of artificial and organic substances shows things (dis)organizing themselves: an obsolete brand of soda, the leftovers of ephemeral consumption, stitched together with sheddings from animal bodies. Like so many mythic creatures (and the poems of Talking Dirty to the Gods are filled with mythic human-nonhuman hybrids including centaurs, satyrs, fauns, and minotaurs), angels are hybrid beings to begin with, since they are humanoid, but with deathless spirits and wings. Yet this version is particularly "piecemeal" and, in stark contrast to the angel that may well sit atop the Christmas tree within the house above, we recoil from its odd fusion of hybridity and thingness. The ambiguity of "the forces" hints that unknown inhuman forces are in control of the universe. Even the functional monkey wrench puns on the colloquialism of throwing a monkey wrench into the works and signals the fundamental chaos of the scene, despite or because of the human agent's involvement. The personal squinting up "At clandestine eyes in a loom of spiderwebs" echoes Arachne's transformation from weaver to spider - her punishment for talking too dirty to the gods through her tapestry that reflected the gods' sundry perversities, not unlike Komunyakaa's own poems. The power of surveillance is taken from the human and given to things. The self, thus surprised, becomes objectified at being seen by another presence, a Sartrean internal haemorrhage of one's sudden consciousness of the self-as-object. That the gazing, objectifying force is nonhuman unveils "the sud- denness with which things seem to assert their presence and power" (Brown, "Thing" 3) through "occasions of contingency - the chance interruption - that disclose a phys- icality of things" (4). "Monkey Wrench" therefore makes another reference to human- nonhuman hybridity, to bizarre kinship between the human and natural worlds, here knotted to one another through the connective thread of shared craft. This image plays on the myth that humans learned the skill of weaving by imitating spiders' art. Through the speaker's experience in this corrosive underworld, we watch human design (the faulty pipes) succumb to the tyranny of things in the proliferation of struc- tures rapidly evolving perhaps independent of any all-embracing intelligent design. The spreading, encircling loom of spider webs, intricate things made by things, reveals the complexity of this naturally occurring system and reminds us that humans are not the sole, nor even the most effective, nor even the most artful, agents of invention. In things, shifting we from turn the from pattern a world of dying in which, objects accidentally to the equally freed unsettling from codes force of of human living things, we turn from a world in which, accidentally freed from codes of human value, things come to hate us. Whereas dying objects stand in stalwart contrast to the human figurations that seek to contain them hermetically and hermeneutically, the</page><page sequence="9">Daniel Cross Turner 145 mode of living things in Komunyakaa's verse brings to life "a world in which persons and things are partly strangers and partly kin" (Frow 276). Such created kinship is at the root of totemism, which denotes a profound, sacrosanct interrelation between the human and things of nature. Drawing on anthropological studies by Émile Durkheim and Claude Lévi-Strauss, W.J.T. Mitchell contends that "totems are evidence for what we might call a first second nature, a state of culture that is much closer to nature than our modern world" ("Romanticism" 178). And yet the totem represents "the ideolog- ical image par excellence, because it is the instrument by which cultures and societies naturalize themselves" ("Surplus" 9). While totemism reflects "the longing for an inti- mate relationship with nature and the greeting of natural objects as 'friends and com- panions,'" it is also "the figure of the kind of guilt, loss, and tragic transgression that only becomes imaginable when natural objects enter into a family romance with human consciousness" ("Romanticism" 182). Talking Dirty to the Gods contains a continuum of totemie items. This includes literal mentions, such as in "Homo Erectus," where this species particularly not far removed from his genetic kinship with animals follows the territorial imperative, "pissing around his gut-level / Kingdom" as he "builds a fire &amp; hugs / A totem against his chest" (4), or the sacred scarab totem that appears in various forms in various poems, including "Amber," "Aliens," and "Avarice." But the volume also incorporates creatures that are made into figurative and often ironic totems, which often outstrip our modes of knowledge and accompanying hubris (the myths of mastery we invent through religion and science and art), thereby restoring us to our status as things of nature. This emphasis on totemie kinship involves ecological concerns (humans are not sole masters of earth - we do not keep the universe alone) as well as existential issues (the natural process of death literally dehumanizes us as the human body, denuded of consciousness, returns to matter, a thing of the earth). Just as humans come to seem more thinglike than godlike, things take on traits of sentience and wil- fulness, worrying the boundaries of the human and nonhuman. Viewed sometimes in friction, sometimes in fusion with nature, the human species itself appears in flux, undergoing continuous evolutionary metamorphosis. "The Four Evangelists" creates an unnerving synthesis between totemism and Christian iconography. The poem forges a hybridization of religious forms between abstract monotheism and a "primitive" belief system that strives to animate things as well as their images. It begins with an index of three of the gospel- writers (minus Matthew, who is typically associated with a human form) alongside their particular totemie animal as assigned by exegetic tradition,5 implying that the surviving rem- nants of archaic totemism underlie the symbolic scaffolding of ritualized Christianity:</page><page sequence="10">146 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) The lion, Mark - The óx, Lúke - The éagle, Jóhn - Ezékiél dréamt the wheel Túrning like a cónstellátion, A cycle of magpies, winter To springtime. (51) The parallelism of the opening three lines is sound and mathematical: two marked beats per line with a heavy caesura precisely in-between, functioning like an equals sign in the lockstep equation of each evangelist and animal. The rhythm then transfers into the volume's customary four-beat lineation to depict Ezekiel's surreal vision of a wheel within a wheel, read retroactively as an Old Testament type prophesying the arrival of the four evangelists of the New Testament. Ezekiel's dream is described through recourse to natural cycles, interlacing the instinctual wheeling motions of stars, birds, and seasons. The image of the turning constellation fosters an associative shift with the following line, "Paul shepherds them / Like a bawdy son of Horus" (51). The four sons of the Egyptian deity Horus are linked to the circumpolar stars of Ursa Major, a con- nection suggestive of the totemie practice of imbuing the natural with sacred meaning. The representation of Paul as an unruly shepherd who rounds up the evangelist- animals and thereby heavily influences the message of early - and often late - Christianity references how Pauline theology attempts to root out the body's bawdi- ness in order to confirm the spirit's purity. Implicit in this comparison is the idea that Paul s preservation of the doctrinal remains of the four evangelists will contain their creedal unruliness, although he himself is described as bawdy. This possible pun on "a bawdy son of a whore" allows space for hypocrisy in his disavowal of the sensuous. The simile suggests the impurity of Christian tradition by proposing a further transcultur- ation of religious practices, an added grafting of pagan and Christian rites, brought into relief through another figure of species hybridity, Horus, who is often pictured as a human with the head of a falcon. This human-animal amalgam echoes the totemie connection between animals and saints; it re-establishes the thingness of the human in the teeth of the Pauline abstraction of spirit from body. This fusion of man and beast is moreover strengthened by the fact that the four sons of Horus are totemie embodi- ments of the four canopic jars that accompanied mummified bodies in ancient Egyptian burial rites and held extracted parts of the deceased: Imsety (human; liver), Hapi (baboon; lungs), Duamutef (jackal; stomach), and Oebehsenuef (hawk; large intestines). Thus they serve as abject reminders that literally preserve the thingness of the human cadaver.</page><page sequence="11">Daniel Cross Turner 147 The poem then touts the necessity of belief in something beyond the binding constructions of religious decrees and creeds: "If you can't trust dreams, the journey / Ends at birth" (51). This epigrammatic punch line betokens the need of some imper- ishable bliss in the very act of mythopoesis, in the knowing yet absorbing unreality of image-making. For Komunyakaa, these dreams and the subsequent journey they engender must be ground in a tangible relation with the things of nature, especially theriomorphic forms; as Mitchell notes, "the living origin of language is in metaphor. And the first metaphors, as commentators from Rousseau to John Berger have remarked, were animals" ("Romanticism" 183). We are made to admit the construct- edness of mytho-religious images and at the same time to confess that the mechanism of invention is not fully human. Mythmaking, to be believable, need remain somehow beyond our depth, in the vicissitudes of chance encounters that inspire a pattern of belief. While there is always some vestige of association that sparks the mythopoetic impulse, in order to maintain a necessary measure of mystery, humans are not fully conscious of mythmaking choices. The crucial obscurity of myth requires that the unknown stays largely unknown: "Gods invent themselves / So men &amp; women see a few feet / Into the unknown" (51). Gods invent themselves by provoking in us such associations, especially between the natural and the divine, and between the erotic and the divine, as the poem's final lines take on a terse structure: Sýmpathétic Magic. Óur desire To prolóng an orgasm, to bé Taken back to whén we could Almost talk with animals. (51) The ways in which gods seem to invent themselves are like sympathetic magic, the belief that images or poppets can affect real events and people. Through magical fig- ures of correspondence and adjacency, sympathetic magic creates vital affinities via metaphor (the Law of Similarity, according to which "like affects like," as the voodou doll bears a metaphoric resemblance to the cursed or blessed person) and via metonymy (the Law of Contagion, according to which contact with an object leads to its continuing presence, as in touching the hem of Jesus's garment, the woman becomes whole). Coupled with the image of orgasm as a physical incarnation of reli- gious ecstasy, the gods are seen as sympathetic embodiments of the human desire for a primal unity with the things of nature, exposed in the totemie iconography of the four evangelists. This impulse gestures toward a primitive regression to a time when</page><page sequence="12">148 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) our kinship with animals was held sacred and beyond doubt, "when we could / Almost talk with animals." Going beyond a nostalgic longing to escape into an Edenie netherworld - a time before man became a dream animal capable of abstract thought and symbolic expression - Komunyakaa s poem encapsulates a desire to re-establish totemie empathy with animals as a basis for a visceral transcendence, one that humil- iates the human, placing us properly as hybrid, evolving animals, continuously under- going genetic and evolutionary metamorphoses. "Ode to the Maggot" offers an ironic vision of the maggot as totemie animal that brings into relief the thingness of the human corpse. A totem of liminality, the maggot performs the constant work of undoing the limits between species, returning distinct creatures to a state of undifferentiated matter, dissolving bodies into a mass of thingness: Bróther óf the blówflý &amp; gódhéad, you work magic Óver báttlefíelds, In slabs of bád pórk &amp; flophouses. (10) The most memorable embodiment of Komunyakaa's "gut-level realism," the maggot is a totemie figure of visceral transcendence, sharing kinship with the blowfly as with the godhead, the abject equally with the abstract; it is a hybrid animal that is part excessively earthly thing that lays eggs in and feeds off of rotting carrion, but also rep- resents the airy purity of the monotheistic godhead, the divine in its most pristine, untouchable form. This doubleness between the instinctual and the sublime is repro- duced on the level of form through the consummate design of the poem's condensed lines, intensive spondees, and muscular plosives, especially the reiterated "b" and "d" sounds in rapid succession. The idea that the maggot works magic implies its totemie status, bringing about a heightened recognition of the ties between human and ani- mal life through the "magic" of natural deconstruction, the invisible decomposition of the corpse that must have seemed magical to the naked eyes of Homo Erectus. Living emblems of entropy, maggots make their ineluctable presence known all over the human world - "Over battlefields, / In slabs of bad pork / &amp; flophouses" - everywhere decay can be found, and decay can be found everywhere: Yes, yóu Gó to the róot of all things. You are sound and mathematical. Jésus Christ, you're merciless With the trúth. (10)</page><page sequence="13">Daniel Cross Turner 149 The maggot is the quintessential thing that fleshes out the thingness of all living things, intermingling life (food and reproduction) with death (the carrion). Maggots go to the root of all things as they literally go to the root of all things, diminishing a complex animal to its bone structure. The chaos they beget is well ordered, for they are "sound &amp; mathematical," just as the poem's form is itself "sound &amp; mathematical." The rhythmic patternings also go to the unconscious, visceral root of language, trig- gering a dynamic, if fleeting, experience of sensation over cognition. To describe the maggot as "sound" and free from decay is clearly ironic, since these beings bring decay to all other creatures through the mathematical certainty of their disintegration and reintegration of energy from living to dead back to living things. With absolute con- sistency, the maggot's work is the single unarguable answer in existence. The surprise epithet, "Jesus Christ," reveals human wonder at the abiding truth of the maggoťs work, their a priori force, since they are "Ontological &amp; lustrous" (4), logically implacable and oddly beautiful. Their haunting presence is echoed in the euphonic hollow "o"s and rolling "l"s, as they "cast spells on beggars &amp; kings / Behind the stóne door of Caesar's tomb / Or split trénch in a field of ragweed" (4). The old saw about death as the great leveller, balancing out beggars and kings alike, is granted compelling specificity through the reference to Julius Caesar's tomb. Although it stands at the centre of the Roman Forum, the tomb is characterized by an apt plainness as a low- built, unadorned construction that holds only a small stone altar, in an advanced state of collapse. Moreover, a lowly, albeit tenacious plant, ragweed is the botanical equiv- alent of the maggot as an ostensibly "insignificant" yet unstoppable life form. Ragweed is an invasive plant, just as the maggot is an invasive animal. In a twisting irony, the scientific name for ragweed is "ambrosia," food of the gods. Like the open- ing description of the maggot as "Brother of the blowfly / &amp; godhead," the image of a field of ragweed also allegorizes the experience of visceral transcendence, for a sense of immortality is built into its name, even if we might wish it were not such an entrenched, undying form. The poem closes with a final paean to the maggot's hallowed unconcern for human codes, symbolized by the aural scrambling of near anagrams "decree" and "creed": No decree or créed can óutlaw yóu As you take every living thing apart. Little Master of éarth, nó one gets to heaven Withóut góing through yóu first. (10) Flatly indifferent to the abstractions of creed and the decrees that issue forth from creedal affiliations, the maggot is etymologically an "outlaw" since its authority lies</page><page sequence="14">150 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) always outside the law, beyond human constructions, converting the body into an utter thing. It takes us all apart en masse (we all face the same mordant fate) and one by one (we all face it alone). The closing lines invoke Hamlet's famous demonstration of "how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar" (4.3.31-32) to assure this "Little / Master of earth" that "no one gets to heaven / Without going through you first." If, as Hamlet soundly suggests, "we fat ourselves for maggots" (4.3.22-23), then the maggot's process of death is endless in both senses: unending, yet also ultimately pointless.6 While it memorably and surely reminds us of our own coming death, "Ode to the Maggot" does not subscribe to the "moral economy of the memento mori " in an effort to "preserve species dignity" (Lamb 140); its attitude toward this totemie crea- ture is "not iconoclastic hostility or moralism but curatorial solicitude" (Mitchell, "Surplus" 7). In recording the thingness of the world and of ourselves, the poem eats through ontological distinctions that traditionally define the human species, as the maggot invades the corpse and viscerally dissolves the integrity of the human, an idea that resonates in "Outside Gethsemane," where Death chéws óťf a finger to show Whát it is made of. Vówels dribble Pinfeathers. We nibble ón a spine To fórce the thing to hówl, to crawl. (118) As Michael Taussig aphoristically notes, "death animates things" (305). Like the end- less task of the maggot, death shows humans what it is made of - its inescapable strength - as it shows us what the finger is made of - the materiality of the human body concentrated by decay and/or sheer pain. Echoed by the unnameable thingness of poetic rhythm in the aural insistence of these lines (the interlinear rhyme and the intensively alliterative "w"s and "l"s), death's work summons an inarticulate, inhuman cry, a resounding howl of utter and therefore unutterable thingness. As eclectic demonstrated 132 - the by intense the texts materiality here under of the scrutiny poems - only in Talking four out Dirty of to an the incredibly Gods is eclectic 132 - the intense materiality of the poems in Talking Dirty to the Gods is manifested with especial force through the palpable rhythms of Komunyakaa's heavily impressed, aurally bound lineation, and redoubled through the density of the volume's myriad allusions, its thick web of intertextuality. Against a hermetic segregation of poetry from the things of the world, this thoroughgoing allusiveness points us towards referentiality, even if we know that poetic reference is never simple nor complete. The strength of Komunyakaa's verse lies in its radical condensation, as each poem functions as a universe unto itself, engendering an exceptional range of associative plays. The</page><page sequence="15">Daniel Cross Turner 151 sheer layeredness of the volume calls to mind a further, interrelated degree of poetic thingness since Komunyakaa's poems themselves are of course made things, and par- ticularly thorny, complex artefacts at that. The work of unpacking these tightly com- pressed verbal expressions - these thinking, speaking things - is at times excruciating: the condensed, reiterative four-quatrain structure often makes one feel the weight of thought, as thinking itself begins to feel like a thing. From one view, the poem is an object because of the material disposition of words by a subject. Yet the poem is also a thing, to the degree that it takes on resonances that are never wholly in the poet s con- scious control. Such shifting allusiveness and expansive associative plays express a latent power that exceeds categories of conscious meaning, thus drawing poetic texts out of objecthood and into thingness. With regard to their status as both made and yet unmade things, the poems of Talking Dirty to the Gods are noteworthy contemporary examples of Daniel Tiffany's conception of "lyric substance," the "inherent obscurity" of lyric poetry "as a substance that mirrors the darkness of things" (81), for "What pre- cisely does obscurity yield in the act of reading - in the absence of clear, cognitive meaning - if not a sense, strange indeed, of poetic materials ?" (83). Like the riddlic poems Tiffany analyzes, Komunyakaa s poems full of things also construct "an explicit correlation between the elements of lyric and the material substance of unknowable things (which are also common things)" (86) that self- reflexively brings into relief "the technics of poetry" (77), especially the obscure yet substantial force of the poems' rhythmic form. In combination with the volume's representation of dying objects and living things laden with obscurity, the sublime thingness of its rhythmic structures presents a telling emanation of its traffic in the darkness of things, engaging as it does with the visceral and the transcendent at once. The motif of things in Komunyakaa's Talking Dirty to the Gods thereby points to the thingness of poetry itself through the sublime force of poetic rhythm, which offers us a visceral and powerful, if momentary, form of transcendence. A central condition of a pragmatic definition of lyric poetry is not merely its typical stress on figurai density and non-narrative performance, but its par- ticular attention to sound patterning and the rhythmic propensities of language in connection with "the bodily experience of temporality" (Culler 205). While "narrative structures are translatable," lyric is language "made memorable by its rhythmical shaping and phonological patterning" (205). 7 Poetic rhythm emphasizes the materi- ality of words in themselves, as sheer physical sensation alienated temporarily from codes of social valence. Rhythm involves "cognitive apprehension - the recognition, expectation, and completion of patterns - and physical involvement or participa- tion"; it is both physical and mental, "affirming a nonlinguistic continuum of body</page><page sequence="16">152 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) and mind" (Aviram 43). The material aspect of rhythm summons our instinctual response, its inarticulate yet insistent pulsations stirring parallel movements in the body and engaging the reader's desire to participate through a certain abandonment to the sensual properties of language. Komunyakaa's understanding of the transcendent force of poetry that engenders blunt confrontation with the obduracy of things shares much with the sensuous yet unknowable intensity of rhythm. The volume's terse, tense four-beat lines with arrest- ing, start-and-stop rhythms are infused with a synaptical energy through acute tonal shifts and stunning interspersions of vernacular phrasings with surrealist imagery. The thingness of the poems is embodied deeply in the driving impulse of their heightened sounds. These patterns of percussive reiterations, devoid of meaning in themselves, stress most dramatically the pure physicality of language and beckon us to allegorize their indefinable power. The interleaving of the motif of thingness and the unnameable presence of poetic rhythm in Komunyakaa's poems speaks to the relation between things and ideas, sensation and cognition, fragments and forms, taking up the question, in Brown's terms, of "whether the literary object should be understood as the object that literature represents or the object that literature has as its aim, the object that liter- ature is" ( Sense 3). Per Komunyakaa's poetry of things and thingness, the answer is both. In Talking Dirty to the Gods , the ineffable workings of poetic rhythm provide a trench- ant sense of the liminality of thingness as, on the one hand, "the thing baldly encoun- tered" and, on the other, "some thing not quite apprehended" (Brown, "Thing" 5). NOTES 1/ Komunyakaa is most known for his poetic recollections of his service as an African American G.I. who saw combat during the U.S. war in Vietnam. 2/ Nearly all critics and reviewers remark on the four-by-four structure of the 132 poems, all of which consist of four quatrains, and catalogue the variegated pantheon dazzlingly presented in an "almost riotous assemblage of art, artifacts, mythology, historical moments, and meditations on nature" (see Angela Salas, "Talking Dirty to the Gods and the Infinitude of Language: Or Mr. Komunyakaa's Cabinet of Wonder." Callaloo 28.3 [2005]: 800). In Talking Dirty to the Gods - the title itself is telling - images from Greek and Roman myths are interspersed with those from the African and Caribbean diaspora, crafting a poetic ethnography that speaks pointedly to the collisions and cohesions of modernity on a global scale. Science (from Lucretius to evolution to theories of chaos and complexity), philosophy (from classical to Eastern to existentialism), religion (from Christianity to Voodou to Buddhism to animism to Hinduism), psychiatry (from Freudianism to Jungian archetypes to neuroscience and pharmapsychology), music (from blues to country to pop to jazz to rap), painting (from Renaissance art to impressionism to cubism to surrealism), sculpture (from primitive to classical to modern), film (from King Kong to Godzilla), and, of course, poetry (from Ovid to Shakespeare to Rimbaud to Dickinson to Harry Crosby to Plath to Komunyakaa himself) are all fair game as foundations for formulating new cultural myths.</page><page sequence="17">Daniel Cross Turner 153 3/ Komunyakaa explains the relation between this form of "gut-level realism" and temporary transcen- dence through confrontation with the intractable real: A good example might be "Ode to the Maggot." A lot of people laugh when they hear that poem. And of course it's not your typical laugh - it's a different kind of laugh - because of the gut-level realism of the poem. There is a kind of realism there, and by embracing that realism, one transcends. [. . .] And that's the only time transcendence can happen: when the foundation is very solid. [. . .] Because there aren't any escapes. [. . .] But in the final analysis, I think the world demands, in all of its fearful certainty, that we embrace that which is real. (Turner 343) 4/ 1 have inserted diacritical marks into the quoted passages of Komunyakaas poems to help illustrate my analysis of their rhythms. 5/ The animalistic iconography for the four evangelists is derived from interpretations of four human- animal hybrids that appear in Ezekiel 1:4-5 and 1:10, and are reiterated in Revelations 4:5-8. 6/ The closing lines of "Ode to the Maggot" also contain an allusion to Hamlet's statement that "The King is a thing ... Of nothing" (4.3.29-31) to suggest not merely that the king is "of nothing" - meaning "of lit- tle account" - but more significantly that he, like the rest of us, is a material thing that will dissolve, via maggots, into nothing. 7/ For sustained arguments in support of rhythmic form as a crucial distinguishing property of a prag- matic definition of poetry, see Amittai F.
