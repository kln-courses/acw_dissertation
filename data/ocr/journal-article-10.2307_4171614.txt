Often rocked by severe earth- quakes, and possessed of a climate far from salubrious, it is and always has been a land supportive only of the hardiest. Yet here, about the shores of Lake Van and along the upper reaches of the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Greater Zab rivers, there emerged in the ninth century B.C. a political state of great vitality, which, until its destruction by Scythians and Medes in the early decades of the sixth century, seems to have been one of the ancient world's greatest producers of bronze and aesthetic bronze objects and one of the major trans- mitters of Asiatic culture to the preclassical West. This was the ancient Arme- nian kingdom of Van, Biaina, which today is called Urartu after its Assyrian name, but which has always been remembered, however dimly, as the biblical Ararat.1 Probably no historical document surviving from Near Eastern antiquity is more dramatic or full of incidental detail than the eyewitness account, pre- served on a huge cuneiform tablet now in the Louvre, of the Assyrian campaign against Urartu in 714 B.C.2 Composed by a royal scribe, who, in his day, could have had few equals in rhetorical ability, it recounts how in that year Sargon II raised an army not only to strike terror in the hearts of his reluctant vassals among the Medes and Manneans but also to pour forth his wrath upon Rusa, the king of Urartu, for having encouraged their dissaffection in the first place. With enough spectacle for several Hollywood epics, the text vividly recreates each incident on the Assyrian march over the jagged peaks of Kurdistan, through the valleys of the Urmia basin, and across the Armenian highlands all the way to Lake Van, providing us with a rare glimpse of the kingdom of Urartu and its satellites at the height of their power and magnificence. Throughout, of course, the chronicler describes with the usual malignant satisfaction the devastation wrought by his sovereign upon the hill people, yet at the same time he reveals an evident astonishment at the many natural and man-made wonders of the country, coming very close at times even to express- ing admiration for the high quality of existence that they had attained for themselves through their industry and ingenuity. We discover, for example, that with the encouragement of an enlightened monarchy the Urartians had built a remarkable system of stone aqueducts and canals that fed water over vast distances to areas where formerly there had been only desert, creating rich fields for crops and lush meadows whereon great herds of horses could feed and breed. Orchards, pleasant gardens, and parks with groves of shade trees beautified the strong-walled towns that were built at every important pass and promontory, and the produce of vineyards swelled great wine cellars. Having once crippled the ability of the Urartians to resist effectively by cutting to pieces Rusa's army in a wild, snow-clad mountain defile, Sargon was able to traverse their bountiful countryside virtually unopposed, "smashing like pots" over four hundred villages and towns, whose citizens had fled in terror. Everywhere he destroyed the crops or ruined the fields by the passage of his armies and herds, felled the valuable trees, plundered the grain stores, broke open the huge vats of wine, and carried off whatever booty he could find. Of all Sargon's depradations, though, none was to equal in magnitude the climactic outrage of his campaign, a surprise attack, with a thousand horse, on Musasir, a remote, undefended cult center of the Vannic kingdom, the seat 1. The original, non-vocalized Old Testament referred to the land as Crrt. (In Gen. 8:4 the ark was said to have rested on its mountains. In 2 Kings 19:37 and Isaiah 37:38 the sons of Senna- cherib, his assassins, were said to have fled to Crrt, and in Jeremiah 51:27-28 the fall of Babylon at the hands of Crrt is prophesied). Later, when vowels were added to the Hebrew text, the name was rendered Ararat, perhaps because of its close phonetic relationship to the name of the indigenous tribe of Alarodioi (Herodotus 3. 94, 7. 79). In Assyrian documents, however, the name first appears in the annals of Shalmaneser I (1274-1245 B.C.) as Uruatri, and later, from the reign of Assurnasirpal 11 (883-859 B.C.), it be- came standardized as Urartu. 2.

The enormous treasures of the city, especially the weight and profusion of skilfully wrought metal objects, dazzled the con- querors and sorely taxed the scribe, who at one point even despaired of being able to find proper names for them all. Stores of silver and gold, precious stones and valuable woods, both in raw and in worked form, were seized in almost unbelievable quantity, but by far the largest portion of the plunder consisted of the bronze taken from the great temple of the god. In addition to over a hundred tons in ingots alone, this was said to consist of many large solid-cast statues, hundreds of cauldrons, cult basins, and sacred utensils, thousands of fancy shields, helmets, and suits of armor, and hundreds of thousands of swords, spears, and arrows in their quivers, all of which had been left as votive offerings by the Urartian kings. Something of the grandeur of the cities and towns of Urartu may be imagined from the enormous size of their ruins still visible across eastern Turkey, Soviet Armenia, and northwestern Iran. Some of the largest were fortified with walls of immense proportions. At both Van and Altintepe near Erzincan, for example, one may still see courses of giant ashlar blocks, some weighing up to forty tons each, and some raised up to heights of sixty meters. At Van it is also apparent that such stones had been quarried on the other side of the lake and trans- ported by ship. As evidence of the magnificence of some of these mountain strongholds, one may also cite the fragments of wall paintings found in the temple and palace ruins of Arinberd and Karmir-Blur, near Yerevan, of Aznavur, Adilcevaz, and (;avustepe, north of Lake Van, and again of Altintepe. Most of the same sites, too, have revealed spacious storerooms and wine cellars such as those in which Sargon was said to have treated his army to "a river of wine." The storage vats at Altintepe have been estimated to have had a capacity of forty thousand gallons! Yet probably the single most impressive surviving Urartian monument is an aqueduct built by King Menua in the early eighth century B.C. that to this day supplies fresh water to the town of Van from a spring forty-five miles distant.3 Our concern here, however, lies not with the major works of the Urartians but with the lesser, movable ones. The vast, seemingly unimaginable treasure of Musasir, as recorded in the Assyrian manifest, has now become almost imaginable by virtue of the many beautiful gold, silver, and bronze objects that have appeared recently both in archaeological excavations as well as on the European art market. True to the Assyrian account, it seems now that the principal repositories of the Urartian treasures were indeed the major temples and their outbuildings, for to date no less than six temple sites have given evidence of having once been stocked with material such as that plundered by Sargon.4 These have produced from their debris such things as solid-cast anthropomorphic or theriomorphic furniture elements, cauldrons or their attachments, sumptuous raised vessels, and, in largest quantities, weapons and pieces of ornate armor. judging from the surviving material, the most elegant and impressive objects were those made from thin sheets of metal decorated with elaborate chased and repousse designs. In this medium are numbered round shields bearing concentric friezes of lions and bulls, decora- tive parade helmets, quiver plaques, wide belts adorned with processions of warriors and animals, horse trappings, votive plaques, and architectural models embossed with figures of worshippers and divinities. Many of these objects 3.

Similar material seems also to have been deposited in the large masonry or rock-cut tombs of the wealthy, although with few exceptions these seem to have been thoroughly looted in antiquity. Yet even when empty these imposing chambers bear evidence of having once been richly furnished, for many have large subsidiary storage rooms and niches for offerings, and in the case of the royal tombs at Van, there are still bronze fittings affixed to the walls that once held ornamental metal shields or disks.5 At present only one unplundered tomb of this class has been scientifically excavated at the site of Altintepe near Erzincan. This was found to contain the bodies of a man and woman in stone sarcophagi, their rich garments, their gold and silver jewelry,wooden furniture with ivory inlays and bronze or silver fittings, a bronze cauldron on a tripod, iron weapons and tools, a bronze belt and shield, an assortment of fancy bronze horse trappings, and a dismantled chariot.6 Although objects of Urartian manufacture have been known for the past century, the greater number having found their way to the British Museum, the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, the Hermitage, and the state museums of Turkey and Soviet Armenia, it has only been within the past decade that other mu- seums, especially those in the United States, have had the opportunity to acquire similar pieces as a result of the recent appearance in Europe of hun- dreds, even thousands, of Urartian artifacts. Mostly of bronze and all unfor- tunately without certain provenance, these are only now beginning to appear in publications or in exhibitions such as that held in the fall of 1976 at the Prahistorische Staatssammlung in Munich.7 Many are executed in well-attested styles, while others appear strange and unfamiliar, yet all evoke a world of unrefined opulence, consciously, if superficially, modeled on that of Assyria, yet generally tinctured with a certain ill-concealed undercurrent of barbarism. All these pieces inevitably astonish the eye and capture the fancy with their array of pictorial devices recalling an environment in which violence and mili- tary conflict, predatory beasts, fabulous creatures of superstition, and strange gods and their ministrations played key roles in the experience of daily life. Although an effort to compile a photographic record of these newly dis- covered objects has been made in Munich,8 still by far the greater number has not yet been published in photograph, and indeed, at this point their chrono- logical and geographical distribution as well as their true significance are still only imperfectly understood. For the present we can only publish the few Urartian pieces that find their way to Boston in the hope that other museums and private collectors, both here and abroad, will quickly do the same. Unfor- tunately, until a thoroughly updated study is made available, it is not possible to do more here than describe the Boston pieces in relation to a mere handful of published parallels. Nevertheless, at the very least, we may now come to think of this remote land less as the traditional resting place of the ark than as the engenderer of one of the most significant and fascinating cultures to have evolved in the ancient Near East. Among the best known and most frequently published of the Urartian metal creations are the wide bronze strips that were used as belts. The Museum of Fine Arts has recently acquired two of these objects, whose decoration repre- 5. Burney and Lang, Peoples of the Hills, p. 145. 6.

In this article, I shall examine these pieces, together with some of their precursors and contemporaries, and briefly trace the history of the wide metal belt in the Near East and in Urartu in particular. I shall also review what is known to date of the iconography of Urartian toreutic art, suggesting the possible origins of some of its most typical motifs and attempting to explain some of its oddest. Bronze belts covered with embossed designs have been found in the debris of both Urartian temples and tombs. Although the Assyrian word for such belts, if provided at all, has not been identified in the list of bootyfrom Musasir, these objects nevertheless were probably present in quantity as accessories to the suits of armor and sacred garments that were found in such great num- bers during the sack. Indeed, fragments of unusually fine belts have been found within or around the temple precincts of such sites as Kayalidere, (avu?tepe, and Karmir-Blur, where the same soil has also yielded up pieces of lamellar armor and cloth garments, no doubt the remains of similar votive hordes once deposited there.9 Much more frequently, decorated bronze belts have appeared in funerary contexts, indicating that these distinctive, seemingly ungainly things were not only a standard feature of Urartian dress, common to all classes of society, but were also customarily buried with their owners. In a small cemetery of poor cremation burials at lgdir on the south slopes of Mount Ararat, for example, belt fragments together with simple ornaments and tools were found in rock clefts beside the ash-filled urns of the deceased.10 These belts, though similar in form to the museum's complete example, were adorned with no more than crude designs of punched dots rather like those on a complete belt now in a private collection (fig. 2). At Nor-Aresh, near Erevan, three isolated cremation Figure 2 Belt. Urartian, mid-8th century B.C., bronze.

But if less affluent Urartians seem generally to have been cremated, more prosperous individuals were frequently interred in small rock-built chambers. An intact tomb of this type near Patnos contained, beside the skeletons of a man, a woman, and a girl, a wealth of grave goods including a complete belt that had obviously belonged to the man.12 No photographs of this material, unfortunately, have yet been pub- lished. In a cemetery in the peripheral Transcaucasian site of Tli was found, folded up and lying on a skeleton, a very handsome belt in a provincial Urartian style, which depicted in three registers, chariots, horsemen, and bowmen chasing bulls, running birds, stags, and lions.13Again, in the great undisturbed tomb at Altintepe an exquisite belt, much in the manner of Boston's complete example, was discovered lying inside a cauldron with some bronze harness elements. Its decoration consisted of forty-five figures in a threefold frieze: mounted warriors, centaurs, lions, bulls, winged horses, goats, and winged lions. Like the Tli belt, it, too, had been deliberately folded up, probably so that it could never be worn again.14 Nevertheless, fragments of old belts were sometimes reused apparently for religious purposes, as is indicated in the horde of votive plaques found at Giyimli near Gurpinar.15 Many of these little pieces, usually decorated with rather crude figures of gods and votaries, appear to have been made from beaten and re-engraved cut sections of discarded belts, whose original patterns are still occasionally visible on the reverse. Why so many of the unprovenanced belts exist in fragments is unclear. On the other hand, a great many may be cited that are in a nearly perfect state of preservation, as if they had been either worn to the grave by the dead or placed carefully beside them with their other valued possessions. An example of such a belt is illustrated in figure 2. Stylistically it is rather like some of the fragments from lgdir, whose surface decoration consists mainly of horizontal rows of punched dots, but on one end is a panel containing three lions and three hel- meted harpies. The surface of the other end preserves intact an attachment to which the fastening thong was tied. Of all the published belt finds, none is quite so dramatic as that reported from the 1973 excavations at the fortress of c?avustepe. In a mass burial con- taining the bodies of those who had been killed defending the citadel during a violent attack, one skeleton was still clad in a bronze belt, which was described in the report only as "an excellent example of Urartian metal workmanship."'16 Although the Urartians seemingly manufactured the supreme examples of the type, they were neither the first nor the only people to wear belts made from wide strips of metal. Indeed, the history of the metal belt in the ancient Near East can be traced back well into the mid-third millennium B.C.17 In Ana- tolia the Hittites had a long tradition of wearing wide metal belts, which appear on cast statuettes and molded figurines as early as the period of the Assyrian merchant colony at Kultepe (ca. 2000-1750 B.C.). The same kind of belt was still in use throughout the period of the Hittite Empire (ca. 1400-1200 B.C.), for it may be seen not only in the relief sculptures and other human representa- tions of the period but also in a splendid bronze and silver example excavated at Bogazkoy.'8 More metal belts appear either in original examples or in abun- dant relief representations from the Neo-Hittite centers of North Syria and from the sites of the major Assyrian cities, as well as from the areas of the 9.

Indeed, these designs seem not to antedate the reign of Sarduri I, who first welded the Armenian highlands into a united kingdom about 840 B.C. The dramatic territorial gains and military conquests of this prince and his immediate successors, together with the corresponding eclipse of Assyrian might, thrust Urartu in the late ninth and early eighth centuries into a position of dominance in the Near East. This new prestige seems to have at once awakened within her a national consciousness that, with the establish- ment of a strong state religion, made necessary and inevitable the formulation of a national art style and the production of works of art. Without a cultural heritage or an artistic tradition flamboyant enough to satisfy the new imperial image they cultivated, the Vannic kings naturally turned for direction to neighboring Assyria, the very country with which they were most often at war. Thus, they not only imitated the ruthless expansionist poli- cies of the Assyrian kings but also affected the Assyrian royal titulary, dressed their troops in Assyrian-style armor, and, it would seem, even disdained their own native hieroglyphic writing for the Assyrian cuneiform script. But the most conspicuous indication of the extent to which they admired and borrowed from Assyria is found in their art, which, when it first appears in objects dating from the reigns of lshpuini (ca. 825-810 B.C.) and Menua (ca. 810-785 B.C.), reveals that the Urartians had already thoroughly accepted Assyrian aesthetic values as their own.24 Urartu did not become a mere provincial imitation of her southern neighbor, however. Her people were mountain tribesmen, not dwellers of the plain; nor were they of Semitic stock. Their experience, their character, their heri- tage, and their religion differed greatly from those of the Assyrians, and all this is reflected to some extent in their art. To be sure, Urartian works always revealed some features that had been inspired by ninth-century Assyrian prototypes, yet they seldom reflect the kind of epic narrative art seen, for example, in the Nimrud palace reliefs or in the Balawat Gates of that period. Instead, Urartian art appears to have been founded almost exclusively upon the decorative designs of Assyrian minor arts such as textiles, ivories, and seals, lesser works that would have been dispersed into the hills in greatest abundance during the Assyrian wars at the end of the ninth century. But with cultural centers too isolated for significant and continuous direct access to Mesopotamia, the Urartians soon enough developed their own set of very original aesthetic standards. Their art, once germinated from this brief Assyrian interlude, flowered essentially on its own. And once standardized in the later 19.

It is perhaps no coincidence that decorative bronze objects in particular proliferated in the mid-eighth century as never before, for both Argishti I (ca. 785-760 B.C.) and his heir, Sarduri II (ca. 760-730 B.C.), claim in their inscriptions to have received enormous quantities of copper as tribute from their western vassals.25 That it was also a period of great advance in metal- working may be noted from the Assyrian report that Argishti and his uncle (also Sarduri) had each erected monumental solid-cast bronze statues of them- selves at Musasir, one of which is even shown being hacked to pieces by the victors in the Khorsabad reliefs. However, judging by the mass of bronze helmets, quivers, belts, and plaques of various sizes and uses inscribed with the names of Argishti and Sarduri and adorned profusely with designs of min- uscule figures, one would suppose that it was in the flat metal sheet that the Urartian craftsmen found the medium best suited to their creative expression. In December1975 there appeared on the art market three belt fragments, either pieces of the same belt or pieces of similar belts, together with a rec- tangular plaque adorned with like decoration and inscribed "property of Argishti."26 Their unity of style would indicate the contemporaneity of all these pieces and suggest a date probably between 780 and 760 B.C. The inscribed plaque was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (fig. 3), and the largest of the belt fragments was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts (fig. 4). Figure 3 Rectangular plaque.

Several belts or fragments of this same type have already been published, from the Adana Regional Museum in Turkey, from the cremation burials at Nor- Aresh, mentioned above, and from the exhibition "Urartu" held in Munich in the fall of 1976.27 Boston's acquisition is a fragment of an unusually wide belt (15.5 cm), which depicts, in four registers of chased and repousse work, processions of chariots and cavalry duplicated in each register. All of the figures move left except those at the right break, which move right. The figures proceed in single file on double lines (single line at bottom), and none overlap. Each chariot in full view bears a complement of two men wearing Assyrian-style conical helmets. The nearer individual, the chariot commander, is bearded in Assyrian fashion, while the driver, holding whip and reins, is clean-shaven. Each chariot has a lance mounted at the rear, and except for the vehicle on the top register, which has six-spoked wheels, each has eight-spoked wheels of a type not com- mon in Assyrian reliefs until the time of Tiglath-Pileser III (744-727 B.C.). The chariot teams and the cavalry horses are all gayly caparisoned about the head with crests and bobbing plumes, and the chests of the animals are hung with tassels. Their gloriously long tails, which nearly brush the ground behind them, are knotted or filleted in the middle according to a fashion also prevalent among the Assyrians. The cavalry horses are proceeding at a flying gallop, while the chariot horses appear to be ambling, an unusual gait in which the legs of the same side step in unison. Here again the metalsmith has merely imitated the curious Assyrian convention for rendering the trot. Like the chari- oteers, the equestrian figures are armed in the Assyrian mode, with conical helmets and round shields at their sides; yet the long pants they wear are not at all Assyrian and are more familiar in the Scytho-Caucasian milieu. They, too, are beardless, and the frequency with which male figures are represented this way in Urartian art would lead one to suppose that, in contrast to their Meso- potamian neighbors, the Urartians, like the Hittites, preferred the shaven face. Despite the simplicity and naivete of the belt's design and the treatment of the individual motifs, it must be admitted that the overall effect is pleasing-even delightful. Conceivably, this fourfold frieze was intended to represent a procession of alternating chariots and horsemen marching four abreast, where each more distant row appears above the other on a ground plane depicted vertically. Apart from a slight three-dimensionality given the individual figures by a low relief and the use of double lines to indicate the farther legs of the horses, the farther reigns of the chariots, and the profiles of the farther charioteers, no illusion of depth is achieved either vertically or horizontally. Actually, the crowded surface consists of no more than a monotonous repetition of two motifs and their mirror images: the chariot with its crew and team and the mounted warrior. Each is repeated over and over again without any intended variation. Only by the imprecise or careless spacing of the figures in each regis- 34</page><page sequence="10">ter and by alternating the gaits of the chariot and cavalry horses did the artist inadvertently achieve the look of a parade, for some of the participants appear slowed by or bunched up against the horses or vehicles in front of them, while others, lagging behind, appear to be suddenly hastening forward in order to catch up. In sharp contrast to this work is the Assyrian treatment of a similar scene from the bronze gates of Balawat (fig. 5). Here there is a delight in fresh detail; figures of different size and purpose are modeled confidently in differ- ent planes and in different poses and costumes, and an effort has been made to portray reality and individuality. Whether for lack of confidence or inspira- tion or for some other reason, the Urartian artists of the period seem to have cared little for such effects, apparently desiring no more from their work than that it consist of an orderly pattern made up of individually mastered Assyrian motifs that satisfactorily filled up the design space. Belts such as this were made by a laborious process. First, ingots of the raw metal were heated until red hot and beaten out into flat sheets, which were then rolled, perhaps between two cylinders, to produce their characteristic even thickness and smoothness of surface. 28 From the sheet metal a band was cut, which, judging from complete examples, was usually slightly over a meter in length in order to fit the wearer's waist and to permit the overlapping of the ends. The known belts vary dramatically in width, the narrowest being about 5 cm, and the widest over 16 cm, although widths of between 9 and 12 cm seem to be about the average.29 When the strip was cut to size, it was then worked on a firm but pliable form, such as wood or hard pitch, with a variety of little stamping tools or dies. Some of these were hammered into the metal from behind to bring tiny patterns and figures into relief and to give depth to the surface. Others were used to punch and engrave the little reliefs from the front, clarifying their features with lines of different width and curve to create out- line as well as texture. After being highly burnished, each belt was backed with a leather strip and supplied with a simple clasp or fastening device. Then, according to common practice, it could be worn with a woolen robe or skirt as an elegant accoutrement to daily dress, or it could be girded on over a hauberk as a vital piece of body armor (fig. 6). Not long after the middle of the eighth century, it would seem, popular taste began to turn away from the traditional belt designs of military parades, hunts, processions of votaries, or arrangements of genii, showing instead a marked preference for compositions made up almost exclusively of animals. At the same time, while the earliest belt patterns were characterized by arrangements of figures spread along horizontal register lines or within vertical framed pan- els, later belts show an increase in elaborate curvilinear and floral patterns, where the subjects are set within baroque fields of guilloches, braids, volutes, spirals, rosettes, palmettes, fantastic trees, and other unique nameless ele- ments. By the late seventh century, in fact, these purely decorative features 27. 0. A.

The most intriguing feature of the Urartian belts is unquestionably their repertoire of animal motifs. Lions, bulls, horses, goats, and birds were favorite subjects, yet accompanying these from an early date were fantastic composite beasts almost defiant of description, which as time went on increased both in number and oddity. We find birds and animals with human heads, animals and humans with bird heads, and humans and birds with animal heads; there are also bipeds and quadrupeds with bird, scorpion, or fish tails, and all sorts of others with wings, and these are all scattered randomly amid the familiar spe- cies. Sometimes these little creatures appear together with tiny warriors or hunters, who stalk them, who are shown driving chariots, mounted on gallop- ing horses, or running on foot with drawn bows. Occasionally, even some of the animals themselves, particularly those with human torsos, appear as the bow-bearing hunters. Still other belts are embellished with animals bearing gods on their backs. The reservoir of such motifs eventually employed by the Urartian artists seems to have been almost limitless, and no two belts executed in this later manner have yet been found whose designs are precisely matched.30 But if the belt art reveals the full range and capabilities of Urartian art as it matured in the late eighth and seventh centuries, it also sharply defines its limitations. Innumerable as the variations of the motifs may be, most can be traced back to a few fundamental forms, the initial impressions of the one or two basic tools raised on the surface of the metal. The figures of animals and gods, without the details that make each unique, are just like all the other fig- ures, similar in size and similar in pose. Even in the finished state, they never really serve as part of a unified pictorial composition except in the rarest of cases.31 Each figure, in fact, is a tiny complete composition in itself, serving no more than as a single element or space filler in a purely ornamental, textile- like design. A complete belt acquired by the museum in 1972 illustrates many of the characteristic features of the finest Urartian belts of the seventh century (figs. 7, 8). The metal is extremely thin, not quite 1 mm, and because of its high tin content was originally polished to a brassy sheen.32 Though complete, it had evidently been fractured at points about every three to six inches along its surface, but since the pieces had a natural curve, the belt as restored probably 30. The chronology of the various Urartian belt styles has been most plausibly stated by Azarpay, Urartian Art, pp. 47ff. In addition to the belts already cited, see the well-known examples from Zakim, Ani-Pemza, and Karmir-Blur (Piotrovsky, Ancient Civilization of Urartu, pls. 80, 81, 84; and van Loon, Urartian Art, p. 122, fig. 14. Six frag- ments of the Karmir-Blur belt are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art: acc. no. 1971.31a-f). Photographs and discussions of other belts may be found in R. W. Hamilton, "The Decorated Bronze Strip from Guschi," Anatolian Studies 15 (1965), pp. 41-51; Herbert Hoffmann, "An Urar- tian Decorated Bronze Strip from Diyarbakir," in Studies Presented to G. M. A.

Tasyurek, "The Karahasan Bronze Urartian Belt in the Adana Regional Museum," Anatolia 17 (1973), pp. 197-199; Oscar White Muscarella, ed., Ancient Art: The Norbert Schim- mel Collection (Mainz: Philipp von Zabern,1974), no. 133. In Hamilton's article doubt is expressed about the use of the Guschi strip as a belt be- cause of the lack of symmetry in its design. Its restored length, therefore, was given as twice its existing length of 110.2 cm. At that time, how- ever, it could not have been known that an asymmetrical arrangement of the figures on the belts is one of their most typical features for the reason set forth on p. 40 of this article. Unfor- tunately, much of the later literature, following Hamilton, expresses doubt about the use of these objects as belts, although today their use is perfectly clear. 31. Note the extraordinary belt fragment from Kayalidere (Burney, Anatolian Studies 16 [1966], fig. 10), which depicts a combat between chariots and lions. Each figure is rendered differently, several are dramatically contorted, and each interacts with its neighbors. This exceptional object is surely one of the most important pieces of Urartian art yet found and should be recog- nized as such. 32. A laboratory analysis of this belt and the other Urartian bronzes in the museum will be published in a future issue of the Bulletin. 37</page><page sequence="13">Figure 8 Drawing of belt shown in figure 7. 38</page><page sequence="14">39</page><page sequence="15">holds a shape very close to the one it had when last worn. All around the edges at approximately 1.5 cm intervals are punched tiny holes by which the strip was originally fastened to its leather base fabric, whose remnants either were discarded by the original discoverer or had totally disintegrated. The ornamentation consists of fifty-nine figures. The twenty in the first six columns face left, and the remaining thirty-nine face right. This asymmetrical arrangement, a feature typical of many of the belts, was planned deliberately so that the figures coming around the front of the waist would face each other at the clasp but from the rear would appear to move in the same direction. Seven of the figures are gods standing on the backs of animals, while the rest are a variety of galloping or prancing animals arranged in columns. The divine figures appear in vertical pairs, except in one column where there is only a single figure, while the animals appear in levels of four. Separating every five or six columns is a vertical "sacred tree," made primarily from a repeating palmette element, which is also used abundantly about the edges of the belt to form a decorative border. The seven divine figures are dressed and posed similarly. Unlike the Assyrian gods, each is beardless and wears, rather than a tall tiara, a low cylindrical crown with a topknot. Each is clad in a short-sleeved, fringed tunic reaching to the ankles and a knee-length, fringed skirt. Each also draws a bow and stands upon the back of an animal, one foot placed on its rump and the other placed on its head between the ears. To the original beholder all of these animals must have been recognized as sacred symbols and would once clearly have identified the divinities. Religious iconography in which gods in human form were differentiated by the various kinds of animals on which they stood or sat was not unique to Urartu but had its origins in the very earliest cultures of the Near East (fig. 9a-e). As in most ancient societies, both domestic and wild animals became important as religious symbols, either because they played an essential role in the economic survival of the community or because they displayed certain wondrous or fearful characteristics that, like peculiar natural phenomena, were imagined to be manifestations of specific divine natures. The bull, for example, as procreator of the herds, became the symbol of male sexual virility and, as the largest and strongest of indigenous beasts, also symbolized brute force or irresistible power. The stag and later the horse, both difficult to catch, became divine attributes probably because of their swiftness and grace. The ram, too, was probably admired for its sexual abilities, its combativeness, and perhaps, as well, for its agility. On the other hand, the lion and the bird of prey must have been seen to embody the notions of stealth, cunning, and ferocity. Unlike the Egyptians, who had no qualms about drawing their divine symbols from all forms of animal life, no matter how base, the people of Meso- potamia, Anatolia, and Iran disdained the majority of creatures as god signs, choosing only animals that could be considered to manifest some noble char- acteristic that man himself might have envied and wished to claim as his own and would certainly have expected in his gods. Later, as the number of gods increased and as the need for new animal symbols arose, strange biological pastiches were contrived that incorporated the most potent parts of several of the primary symbolic species. Thus, in time, a complex divine heraldry evolved whose blazons were composed not only of real animals but also of an even greater number of weird, nightmarish creatures of fancy, which were found even more suitable as divine emblemata. 40</page><page sequence="16">9a Figure 9 Some Ancient Near Eastern gods and their animal mounts. a Statuette of a goddess, Hacilar, central Turkey, early 6th millennium B.C., terra cotta.

These peo- ples, too, often represented their gods standing on the backs of peculiar animals (fig. 9g-1). Yet the Urartian gods, when they do appear, are clearly styled after the Assyrian, as represented, for example, in the chariot standards visible in the reliefs of Assurnasirpal, on many Assyrian cylinder seals of the period (fig. 9m), and especially in the monumental rupestrian reliefs at Bavian 33.

Thus, of the divine images that appear in Urartian art, only three can be identified with reasonable certainty; not sur- prisingly, theyare the images of the three most important Urartian gods: Haldi, Teisheba, and Shiuini. Traditionally among the Hurrians and Hittites, the principal god was the storm god, who since time immemorial had been represented standing on the back of a bull, as in the archaic sanctuary at Jebelet el Beidha (fig. 9c). To them he was known as Teshub, although in Mesopotamia his counterpart, icono- graphically similar, was called Enlil or Adad. Both were deities of war. In Urar- tian art a god standing on the back of a bull is also one of the most common motifs, familiar on belts in Adana and from Karmir-Blur (fig. 11a,b), in cast bronze furniture elements from Toprakkale, and in a large relief from Kefkalesi, near Adilcevaz (fig. JJc).36 Since the name of the Urartian god Teisheba reveals him to be a latter-day Teshub, there can be no doubt that he is also the god on the bull. Teisheba had doubtless always been the god of greatest importance in Eastern Anatolia until the ninth century, when, with the rise of Urartu, he was displaced as the preeminent divinity by Haldi, a god of obscure origins who probably at first had been no more than the patron deity of the ruling dynasty and had grown in stature only as his devotees rose in political power. Haldi's preeminence may be gauged by the fact that the number of animals sacrificed to him daily, 17 bulls and 34 sheep, was nearly triple the amount allotted to the next most important deities, Teisheba and Shiuini.37 The god that appears most frequently in Urartian art is one that is always depicted standing on the back of a lion, and it is a logical assumption that he would also be Haldi, the most important. Yet one need not rely solely on assumption, for strong evidence supports this identity. A fragment of a painted wall surface from the early eighth-century Haldi temple at Arinberd, near Yerevan, for example, depicts a god, bearded in the Assyrian manner, standing on a lion.38 He appears again, though clean-shaven, in a relief from the seventh- century sanctuary at Kefkalesi, near Adilcevaz, together with cuneiform dedi- 44</page><page sequence="20">cations to Haldi (fig. 12a).39 Most frequently, however, he is depicted on the votive plaques from Giyimli, where he is shown beardless, wearing a low tiara with a single set of horns and a topknot, and holding a mace, a bow, a whip, or a ring. The god and the lion are usually standing, although in one representa- tion the god is seated upon a throne, which is set upon the back of a couchant lion (fig. 12b). On the Boston belt Haldi is twice depicted, drawing a bow and standing on the back of a charging lion. Gods on lions are known in Hittite art as early as the period of the Assyrian merchant colony at Kultepe in the early second millennium, and they appear intermittently in Neo-Hittite art, as, for example, in a Carchemish relief depict- ing the gods of the sun and moon standing on a lion (fig. 91). Yet in the ancient Near East in general, the lion seems to have been more commonly a symbol of goddesses than of gods. This was particularly true in Mesopotamia, where the lion was reserved almost exclusively for a standing or seated Ishtar or Ninlil.40 Mounted on this animal, the goddess appears on countless seals, reliefs, and sculptures from the mid-third millennium onward (fig. 9f). In Anatolia the reliefs in the open-air sanctuary at Yazilikaya also portray Hepat, consort of Teshub and goddess par excellence, standing on a lion and followed by her son Sharumma, who is carried by a similar mount (fig. 9k). Likewise at Tell Halaf in North Syria, a monumental triad of divinities, which held up the roof of the Aramean palace, consisted of a god and a goddess standing on lions on each side of a god on a bull.41 The close relationship between the lion and the female divinity perhaps suggests a continuity of divine iconography even from the Neolithic period. The mother goddesses of 1;atal, Huyuk, and Hacilar were frequently depicted with lions or leopards and were sometimes seated on them (fig. 9a).42 Figure 12 Haldi, the Urartian god on the lion. a Kefkalesi near Adilcevaz.

Ziwiye, Iran, mid-7th century B.C., ivory, inlaid with glass and colored stones, h. 61/8 in. (15.5 cm). Gift of Elie Borowski. 67.31. One of a group of three ivory fragments in the Boston Museum, reportedly from the famous seventh-century treasure found at the site of Ziwiye, about seventy miles south of Lake Urmia, depicts the same deity-on-lion motif re- peated at least twice in a vertical row (fig. 13). The god is winged and beardless, surrounded by a nimbus, and he holds a curving staff. The figures were hol- lowed out, largely by drilling, and the details were filled in with inlays of white paste, blue glass, grayish colored stones, and presumably materials of other colors now missing. Because the Ziwiye horde reflects a commingling of both Assyrian and Urartian artistic influences,43 the winged deity represented here could well be either the Assyrian Ishtar or the shaven Urartian Haldi. Four times repeated on the Boston belt is another motif of a god standing on the back of a horse, and there seems little reason to doubt that this figure represents the Urartian sun god Shiuini. His iconography is more diverse than that of the other gods; his emblem as a winged sun disk is frequent, and on a belt from Karmir-Blur he may also be seen as a running figure supporting a winged sun disk (fig. 14a). Again, on an unpublished bronze a beardless Assur- like torso emerging from a winged disk would seem to be Shiuini (fig. 14b). However, because the horse was of such vital importance to the hill people and one of their major natural resources, it seems likely that the horse, too, would become the symbol of one of their major gods; and because it is his Assyrian counterpart Shamash who stands on a horse in the reliefs at Maltai (fig. 10), it seems that Shiuini, as well, would have been represented this way. There is certainly no dearth of evidence attesting to the horse's status as an animal sacred to the sun among peoples neighboring the Urartians. Herodotus (1. 216) notes that the Caucasian Massagatae worshipped the sun exclusively and offered horses to it in sacrifice, "under the notion of giving to the swiftest of the gods the swiftest of all mortal creatures"; and Xenophon (Cyropaedia 13. 3.11, 24) states that this practice was prevalent among the Medes. Similarly, the kings of Judah had dedicated horses and chariots to the sun and had set them up at the entrance to the temple in Jerusalem (2 Kings 13:11), and in both Babylonian and Greek tradition, the sun was often imagined as a god drawn across the heavens in a chariot.44 An Urartian belt in the Adana Regional Museum twice displays a god standing on a winged horse (fig. 14c), and this motif again occurs on a bronze disk from Altintepe, where the god is shown holding at his side a large, round, winged shield, apparently the sun's disk, with the usual lateral solar streamers (fig. 14d). Of interest in this regard is a bronze mirror in the museum's collection. This object consists of a perfectly round, flat disk, with forty-one evenly spaced studs around the circumference, which is attached to an ornamental bronze socket that held it to an iron handle, now almost totally rusted away (fig. 15). The piece is Urartian, as can be seen immediately by the treatment of the cast socket, which represents two addorsed horses' heads with their harness ele- ments chased on the surface much in the manner of those on the early Boston belt fragment. The shiny mirror disk supported by horses' heads again seems to suggest a solar symbolism. A similar mirror may be that represented on a stele from Doiran near Samsun on the Black Sea.45 Apart from the three major Urartian divinities, two of which are represented on the Boston belt, there are lesser, still unidentifiable gods, which have as yet only rarely been encountered in art. The third divinity pictured here, standing on what seems to be a winged calf or a hornless goat, is not attested precisely 43.

Conceiv- ably, the two are variant representations of the same god, and while his name is still unknown, it is certainly possible that such an image, perhaps in the form of a temple statue, might have inspired the legends of the Golden Ram, which carried Phrixos on its back in aerial flight to Colchis, and whose fleece was sought by the Argonauts.46 Other unfamiliar divine motifs appear on belts in the Adana Regional Mu- seum. One belt depicts a god standing on a griffon with a scorpion's tail (fig. 16b) and a god standing on a winged animal with a spotted leonine body, a scorpion's tail, and a horned, dragonlike head (fig. 16c). On a second Adana piece another deitytwice appears standing on the back of a goat-bodied animal with a horned, fire-breathing dragon's head and human hands as forepaws (fig. 16d,e). Throne elements from the divine dais at Toprakkale also portray figures standing on lion-headed bulls.47 Like the divine figures, the individual animals of the belt's design are all virtually the same size and drawn in similar pose. Each is depicted leaping forward, to left or right, hind legs together on an imaginary ground line and front legs raised. Of the total, twenty are lions and sixteen are bulls, the two commonest motifs in Urartian art. The rest are animals of pure fantasy: two are 46. W. H.

Judging by existing works of art, Urartian mythology must have been a melt- ing pot of many diverse Near Eastern traditions. Because some of the most grotesque of these animal motifs appear regularly with identical characteristics in Urartian, Mesopotamian, and Neo-Hittite art, one is tempted to assume that certain of these creatures must have played specific roles in the religious beliefs or the folklore common to the peoples of all these areas. Most of the animals depicted on the museum's complete belt, for example, can be shown to have served at one time or another as the attributes of certain gods of the Babylonians and Assyrians. Many, too, must have had specific names, for when the Assyrians broke into the temple at Musasir they noted that its locks bore the forms of "protecting goddesses" standing on animals that they recognized as "deluge monsters," whose heads were also identified as forming the bosses of some ornamental votive shields. Some of these curious beasts, in fact, may have served no other purpose than as guardians against evil influences, the idea being, perhaps, that when the most potent parts of the most powerful ani- mals were combined, new creatures could be given existence that were espe- cially efficacious as protectors of one's person, especially when graven on a belt. Such creatures could not only offer defense against real enemies, as in battle, but could also drive away imagined ones, such as the evil eye, witches, and workers of black magic, demons that brought disease or inhabited. eerie places, spirits of the unburied dead, and a host of other unseen terrors that were real enough to the Assyrians and certainly familiar to the Urartians.48 The preponderance on the belt of lions and bulls seems to emphasize the importance of the gods Haldi and Teisheba, whose special symbols they were. The winged bull, too, may simply have been a variant symbol of the latter deity. In the procession of Assyrian gods at Maltai, a winged bull serves as a mount 49</page><page sequence="25">Figure 17 Storm god and dragon, Assyrian relief from the temple of Ninurta, Nimrud. Reign of Assurnasirpal 11 (883-859 B.C.). (Drawing after H. Frankfort, Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, p. 88, fig. 38.) for the third god (fig. 10), and it also appears occasionally as a god's attribute on Babylonian boundary stones.49 In an Assyrian relief from Khorsabad, how- ever, a winged bull clearly acts as a guardian figure, for it is shown to be hover- ing over the sea amid a fleet of ships transporting logs intended for Sargon's palace.50 This same imagined ability of the winged bull to protect from harm may also account for its very frequent use in embroidered or metal appliqu6 designs on Assyrian garments; hence its analagous use as a motif on the Urar- tian belts.51 The winged animal with feathered body, lion's head, horse's ears, and three- pronged tongue, or possibly fiery breath, seems to be the most ancient of these motifs. As early as the Akkadian period in the latter half of the third millennium, this animal appears on seal designs in association with the storm god, sometimes in flight, sometimes as a support for the standing god, some- times as a support for a standing nude Ishtar in company with the god, or again as the draft animal for the god's chariot (fig. 9e).52 A protome of the animal on a scepter or its full body also occurs on Babylonian boundary stones and seals of the second millennium.53 It makes its most spectacular appearance, however, on a slab from Nimrud of the time of Assurnasirpal II, in which the rearing animal is being chased by a running winged god holding bolts of lightning (fig. 17). A somewhat similar animal on the belt, a winged lion with segmented tail and bull's horns, is also found in Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian art, as on an Assyrian cylinder seal in the museum's collection, where the ani- mal's tail is clearly that of a scorpion (fig. 9m).54 In the Urartian version, the tail of the animal is extended rather than arched; and one suspects that the artist, familiar though he might have been with the Assyrian representations, had probably never seen a scorpion. There is one animal on the Boston belt that is not attested anywhere in Mesopotamian art. Its head seems boarlike, or it may be that of an open- 49. L. W.

This creature, in fact, is only one of a huge repertoire of imaginary beasts drawn from the pseudogenera of dragons, wyverns, cockatrices, grif- fons, centaurs, sphinxes, harpies, and other bizarre types in their endless variation, which in the main seem to be unique to Urartian art. Perhaps all of these creatures were believed to have had some apotropaic significance, as those on this belt certainly did. Yet the amusing, awkward aspect of so many of them may suggest that their purpose was not always serious. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine that even the original beholders could withold a smile at the sight of such outrageous hybrids as a cat-headed bird, a horse-headed archer, a sphinx with one human leg, one lion's leg, and two bull's legs, or a bull-headed winged scorpion with human legs! The Urartian animal art provokes our curiosity as much for the novelty and diversity of the motifs it employed as for the motifs it did not employ. The pro- ducers of the belts seem to have let their imaginations run free only within certain limits of style and form-or perhaps taste-beyond which they never ventured. All of the animal figures published to date conform to a kind of un- natural naturalism and never pass into the realm of the truly monstrous. There is never a beast with more than one head, for example, unless we count the curious animals on the sheath of the Melgunov sword, whose wings are actu- ally open-mouthed fishes attached to the thighs (fig. 18G); nor is there an animal that bears more than the possible number of limbs, even though such creatures are by no means unfamiliar in ancient Near Eastern art and literature.55 The bicorporate, the motif of the beast with two bodies joined to a single head, never appears, although it, too, is found occasionally in Sumerian and Achae- menid art.56 Similarly, certain other animal motifs common in Mesopotamia, Syria, and Hittite Anatolia seem to be rare or unattested in the Urartian bestiary. The stag, for example, a frequent divine symbol in Hittite art and often repre- sented from North Syria to Northwest Iran, is mysteriously quite rare in Urar- tian art, appearing only in the wall paintings from Altintepe, on two seals and a curious pyxis from Karmir-Blur, and on the peripheral belt from Tli.57 Yet, oddly, neither stags nor even antlered composites seem to appear on the belts of the mainstream. Dogs and canine attributes also seem to be unknown, although the Assyrians at Musasir did note shields with bosses in the form of "snarling dogs." The Babylonian musru?ssu dragon in its proper form seems to be con- spicuously absent; nor have the Hittite or Achaemenid chimerae, the capricorn of Ea, or the ubiquitous scorpion men (fig. 9m), or mermen of Mesopotamian art yet been encountered.58 The rhyme or reason for this odd ornamental typography eludes us, yet we cannot deny that it was selective. It would not be possible at this point to prepare a complete catalogue of Urartian animal forms because so few of the belts and their fragments have yet been published, and each new piece invariably brings new motifs to light. Nevertheless, as an illus- tration of the variety of animal types already attested, figure 18 should serve as a preliminary key. Along the edges of the museum's belt, and just within its border of holes, is a single, continuous, raised line, which serves to frame the entire decorated surface. It exists on all sides except the left edge, which was deliberately trimmed off in antiquity to shorten the belt. just within this line, repeated 118 times, is a tiny palmette element, which was also heavily utilized to form the sacred tree patterns separating the first six, the second six, and the next five 55.

The final column of animals on the right is also separated from this tree by a vertical column of these palmettes. The element itself was embossed into the belt with a single puncheon, whose square edges are some- times visible. This tool appears to have been commonly used by the belt arti- sans, for its mark can be noted on many other belts and fragments. The motif itself is a very frequent one in both Assyrian and Urartian art. A second recurring design is substituted for animals and gods in three columns. This is a kind of abstract rosette made with several different types and sizes of tools. The central core consists of two concentric circles, with the circumference of the outer circle stamped with a border of tiny circles. Four almond-shaped petals stretch away from the core at diagonals, and the end of each, as well as the space between each, is again stamped with the same large concentric circles of the core. The effect is pleasing to the eye, yet its rather random use is curious. Again, many of the individual elements making up this design are seen frequently on other belts. As to the fastening device for this piece, one can only guess how it worked by the evidence of other examples of belts where such parts have been better preserved. Although several Urartian belt buckles are known,59 many belts actually show no trace of buckles at all and probably fastened only by means of a simple ring on one end that was tied with thongs attached to a metal ring or to the base fabric at the other end. As already mentioned, the left end of this belt seems to have been deliberately pared down so as to make it shorter. Between the second and third columns of animals on the left are four holes, and near these, at each edge of the belt, there are also rivets still holding in place very thin, fragmentary strips of bronze that may originally have extended across the surface of the belt, joining as a safety band. Also on the right end are the remains of a riveted strip, which must have held a ring. The complete belt shown in figure 2 and several others pictured in the Adana and Munich catalogues preserve rakish, dart-shaped bronze plates, on which flying birds were sometimes engraved, with a ring at their pointed end.60 A similar plate in the form of a fish-bodied bird with lion's legs is also attested (fig. 18D). If such a piece had once been fastened to the museum's belt where the four holes are now, its ring would simply have been bound to the ring at the other end with a thong. Similar plates seem to be depicted on a belt worn by the Assyrian war- rior in figure 6a. The only Urartian belt similar to the Boston belt and datable by epigraphic evidence is the example found in the princely tomb at Altintepe, which seems to have belonged to an important personnage of the time of Argishti II (ca. 714- 685 B.C.). Unlike the museum's belt, however, the Altintepe strip has none of the purely decorative elements that occasionally interrupt the registers. As noted by Azarpay, this is a feature that seems to occur on belts of a slightly later period, such as those found at Tli and Gushchi, both of which have been dated by archaeological context or other criteria to the early seventh century.61 To cite further evidence, some of the peculiar animal motifs on our belt are very simi- larly rendered on the gold plaques and pectorals from Ziwiyeh (fig. 19), which probably date from or not long after the reign of Esarhaddon (680-669 B.C.).62 Likewise, the divine figures on the belt are dressed and posed very much like those on the Adilcevaz reliefs of the period of Rusa II (ca. 685-639 B.C.) (figs. llc, 12a). Hence, it would probably not be too presumptuous to assign this piece to the middle decades of the seventh century. 59. Barnett, Anatolian Studies 22 (1972), pp. 173ff. 60.

Ziwiye, Iran, mid-7th century B.C., gold. Cincinnati Art Museum. The Urartian bronze belts and their designs continued to be immensely popular to the beginning of the sixth century B.C., when, with the decline of Urartian power and the influx of Scythians and Medes, they disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared two hundred years earlier. Throughout their span of existence they demonstrate a dramatic development of style and point to a very active class of metalsmiths with a common speciality. The diversity of modeling, surface treatment, choice of motifs, and level of technical com- petence visible on these objects must suggest a number of different ateliers, some perhaps closer to the principal cultural centers than others. Yet at the same time, some of the belts reveal a similarity of workmanship, style, and design that may even distinguish the hand of a single master. As more belts become available for study, the identification of regional traditions and the work of individual craftsmen may even be possible. 55</page></plain_text>
