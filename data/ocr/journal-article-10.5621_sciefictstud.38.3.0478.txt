<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 478 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) Charles Paulk Post-National Cool: William Gibson’s Japan   “See the wonders of this futuristic city!” So beckons the voiceover in a televised tourism promo commissioned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The ad was an early salvo in the ambitious “Visit Japan” campaign, a tourism- boosting initiative introduced by the Japanese government in 2003, with the stated aim of bringing ten million visitors to the country by 2010. The campaign has specifically targeted the United States, which, according to a press release, “is considered to have the most potential for increasing both tourism numbers and tourism dollars spent” (Japan Travel). With the ten million mark now in sight, it is intriguing to observe the manner in which US travelers have been so successfully courted. The Tokyo spot is a flashy, high-energy affair, featuring anime legend Tezuka Osamu’s beloved boy robot Tetsuwan Atomu (better known stateside as “Astro Boy”). The cherubic Atomu is shown rocketing past such famous Tokyo sights as the Imperial Palace and the consumer electronics district of Akihabara. As depicted in the ad, the city resembles a stunning new Disneyworld attraction—a sprawling hybrid of Epcot’s Japan Pavilion and Tomorrowland, with Atomu as a 100,000-horsepower Mickey Mouse. This image of Japan as a forward outpost of the future has long permeated popular culture. Over the past twenty years, skepticism regarding its continued relevance has grown almost equally familiar. On the popular sf blog io9.com, Charlie Jane Anders recently posed the question: “When Did Japan Stop Being the Future?” In her accompanying post, Anders attempts to build a case (largely via YouTube clips) for the “creeping irrelevance” of the high-tech Japanese imagery so frequently and fashionably deployed in sf texts of the 1980s and early 1990s. She does not, however, seem entirely sold on her own premises, ultimately conceding that Japanese pop culture has “remained as influential as ever.” Neither her claim that Japan’s futuristic status has waned nor her corresponding ambivalence is anything new. In his introduction to a nearly decade-old cover story on Japanese futurity, WIRED editor Chris Anderson comes across as similarly conflicted. He deems the gridlocked, scandal-weary, economically grim reality of post-bubble Japan “too dark a model for all but the most dyspeptic futurist.” And yet, he argues, “there is another Japan: Japan-as- metaphor. This is the Japan that represents hypermodernism in all its dimensions.” Here on the brink of the twenty-teens, with the world mired in an economic downturn unaccomodating to futurism of any sort, this Japan-as- hypermodern metaphor has remained curiously resilient. Perhaps, prior to considering when and whether Japan stopped being the future, we should first attend to the question of when and why it began.  Luckily, there is more consensus here. Anders unreservedly cites “the one- two punch of Blade Runner and Neuromancer” as the catalyst, a claim Anderson takes even further, ascribing the entire fraught question of Japan’s twenty-first- century cachet to Willliam Gibson’s novel Neuromancer’s (1984): who, it could </page> <page sequence="2"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 479 fairly be said, has only himself to blame. For three decades, the author has consistently, insistently made a case for Japan as a wellspring of futurity. Virtually every work of fiction Gibson has produced incorporates the nation as a backdrop or background presence. In his hugely influential SPRAWL series, the landscape is littered with Japanese tech, the Asahi Shimbun has supplanted USA Today, and the only cash transactions are conducted in illicit “New Yen.” The nation looms even larger in the subsequent BRIDGE TRILOGY, which depicts a Tokyo of nanotech skyscrapers and holographic pop stars. For Gibson, the future has always been made in Japan. From a critical perspective, I believe the question of why has yet to be satisfactorily addressed. Gibson’s early fiction—his debut novel Neuromancer, in particular—hardly wants for analysis. His bleak-chic images of cybernetic bodies, simulated realities, virtual subjectivity, and urban sprawl have been, and continue to be, painstakingly unpacked. And yet the presence of Japan, no less constant a theme than the aforementioned, has less often been subject to serious scrutiny. The prevailing critical gloss is that Gibson’s Japan, a product of the 1980s, reflects that era’s anxieties about the nation’s coming-of-age as an economic superpower. To date, most readings of the motif have played up this angle, charging that the author vilifies Japan and attempts to reassert the authority of the West (viz. America) through aggressive deployment of “techno- orientalist” imagery.  While not entirely uncompelling, these readings suffer from innumerable shortcomings. For one, they tend to focus exclusively on Neuromancer—a very narrow window into Gibson’s work. For another, they tend to exaggerate the tension between East and West in evidence in the novel, while ignoring more explicit rivalries. Finally, such readings rarely consider the author’s self- professed Japanophilia, the factors driving it, or the favorable reception of his work in Japan—all of which, at minimum, would seem to complicate charges of mere xenophobia. The aim of this piece is to address these shortcomings and to offer an alternate, contemporary take on the creative origins and continued relevance of William Gibson’s Japan.  Boomzilla: Neuromancer and Japan Panic. Today, 40 years after the end of World War II, the Japanese are on the move again in one of history’s most brilliant commercial offensives, as they go about dismantling American industry. Whether they are still only smart, or have finally learned to be wiser than we, will be tested in the next 10 years. Only then will we know who finally won the war.... —Thomas H. White, “The Danger From Japan”  So read the cover of the 28 July 1985 New York Times Magazine, punctuated by the crimson disk of the rising sun. In the corresponding article, ominously titled “The Danger From Japan,” Thomas H. White warned of an impending economic showdown between East and West. Essentially, White predicted a rematch of the Pacific War, to be fought in Japanese boardrooms and on American factory floors, with stakes no less than those at Midway. In retrospect, his rhetoric smacks of alarmism and worse, but it serves as a sobering reminder of the American paranoia Japan’s prosperity once evoked. While the 1980s were an economically stagnant period for the US, and for much </page> <page sequence="3"> 480 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) of the developed world, the decade marked the apex of a 40-year Japanese boom unparalleled in modern history. Kick-started by the Korean war, Japan’s GNP expanded at a staggering rate from the early 1950s through the mid-1970s, peaking at over 10% (Tsuru 67). Growth leveled off in the 1980s, but still outstripped that of the beleaguered United States. The stunning success of “Samurai capitalism” led many to fear Japan was “calling Western modernity into question, and claiming the franchise on the future” (Morley and Robins 149).  In their oft-referenced essay “Techno-Orientalism: Japan Panic,” a chapter of their 1995 book Spaces of Identity, David Morley and Kevin Robins dissect this Western, specifically American anxiety over Japan’s emergence as an economic competitor. Certainly, American protectionism and xenophobia predate the 1980s, as does specific prejudice toward the Japanese. The authors assert, however, that there was something unique about the era’s rampant Japan bashing. In light of their technocapitalist savvy, the Japanese could no longer be dehumanized or condescended to in the traditional manner. The bestial caricatures of WWII propaganda no longer applied. This new prejudice sprang not from Eurocentric presumption of Japan’s inferiority, but from fears of its economic and industrial superiority.  Riffing on Edward Said, Morley and Robins identify this as “techno- orientalism.” In his landmark work Orientalism (1979), Said advances a sweeping critique of the Western world’s historical approach to the Orient—that vague grouping of Eastern lands both Middle and Far. Western Orientalist discourse has long provided a basis for all manner of discrimination and imperialist intervention abroad. The attitudes of Orientalism are clearly observable in early US/Japanese relations, be it the gunboat diplomacy of Commodore Matthew Perry or the aesthetic Japonisme that subsequently crept into American fashion. The newly opened Japan was cast as a quaint, exotically alluring land, but one clearly subordinate to America’s will. By its very nature, it was there to be dominated. This idea of the East as fundamentally submissive is perhaps the defining tenet of Orientalism:  The relationship between Occident and Orient is a relationship of power, of domination, of varying degrees of a complex hegemony.... The Orient was Orientalized not only because it was discovered to be “Oriental” in all those ways considered commonplace ... but also because it could be—that is, submitted to being—made Oriental. (Said 5; emphases in original)  By the 1980s, making Japan Oriental in the classic sense had ceased to be an option. The country’s postwar economic miracle and technological precocity upset the traditional balance of power between East and West. One could hardly dismiss as backward a nation that had come to appear more modern than America. As Morley and Robins observe:  What would the West be without its vaunted technological supremacy? Technology has been central to the potency of its modernity. And now, it fears, the loss of its technological hegemony may be associated with its cultural “emasculation.” (167) </page> <page sequence="4"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 481 From these emasculatory fears, the authors contend, arose techno- orientalism—a Western conception of Japan that simultaneously acknowledges and undercuts the nation’s technological strength. On one level, “seductive” Japanese tech is neutralized through a classically Orientalist process of fetishization, refiguring “pachinko and computer games simply as the postmodern equivalents of zen and kabuki” (169). The threat of Japanese modernity is thus recast in exotic premodern guise, reflecting “the enigmatic and mysterious essence of Japanese particularism” (169). On another, more malignantly racist level, the superiority of Japanese tech is attributed to an inhuman, mechanical quality inherent in the Japanese people themselves. Where wartime propaganda once reduced the Japanese to rats and monkeys, they are now dehumanized in a different manner, depicted as robots and replicants—cold and unfeeling, devoid of individuality. According to Morley and Robins, this roboticization allays Western fears of obsolescence—a cyborg hive mind can design a mean clock radio, but can it tell a joke? As popular sf has taught, superior alien tech might be advantageous in the short term, but scrappy, lovably flawed humanity always wins the day. Apropos, for a look at techno-orientalism in action, Morley and Robins refer readers to William Gibson’s Neuromancer, perhaps the first work of sf to explicitly posit Japan as what Gibson would later call the world’s “default setting for the future” (“Modern Boys”). Neuromancer opens not in outer space, but in Chiba City—in the novel, an industrial slum on the outskirts of Tokyo, where the sky is “the color of television” (1). Chiba is a hardboiled back alley recast as a Martian landscape, decked out in defamiliarizing high-tech exotica. Though the novel’s action quickly leaves Japan, Japanese tech and iconography continue to dominate, which Morley and Robins read as symbolic of Western fears concerning Japanese hegemony. Further, they regard Gibson’s use of this imagery as paradigmatically techno-orientalist. Throughout the novel, there is a juxtaposition of bleeding-edge Japanese hardware with romantic, anachronistic images from the nation’s feudal past. A shuriken and a cyberspace deck are given equally fetishistic descriptive treatment. From this, Morley and Robins conclude: “Through the projection of exotic (and erotic) fantasies onto this high- tech delirium, anxieties about the ‘importance’ of Western culture can be, momentarily, screened out” (169).  Other critics have echoed and expanded upon this reading. In her essay “Orienting Orientalism, or How to Map Cyberspace,” Wendy Hui Kyong Chun further explores the erotic-/exoticizing aspects of high-tech Orientalism. Like Morley and Robins, she perceives Gibson’s “grim Japanified near future” (4) as a manifestation of American paranoia about Japanese economic expansion. Her gloss is that the author’s eroticization of cyberspace serves to assuage this paranoia, offering Western readers a fantasy of Freudian retaliation:  Cyberspace—unlike the physical landscape—can be conquered and made to submit. Neuromancer counters American anxieties ... with a medium that enables American penetration. It turns sexual threat into sexual opportunity by rehearsing themes of Oriental exoticism and Western penetration. (4)  </page> <page sequence="5"> 482 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) In other words, though cyberspace is aglow with the markers of Japanese commerce, it is also at the mercy of Caucasian console cowboys, for whom it “opens like a budding Asian beauty” (5). By way of illustration, Chun highlights the passage in which Case, his nervous system newly restored, reenters cyberspace after a long, involuntary absence: “And it flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick.... And somewhere he was laughing ... distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face” (Neuromancer 52). Unquestionably, the imagery is quasi-erotic, and Chun reads Case’s “slightly rerouted orgasmic release” (Chun 5) as a reaffirmation of Western cultural virility: Entering cyberspace allows one to conquer a vaguely threatening Oriental landscape—to whatever extent sexual penetration ever enables long term conquest. If the Yakuza—what Gibson calls “the sons of the neon chrysanthemum”—altered his system so that Case could no longer jack into cyberspace, by reentering it, he takes over their territory—he reunites with their flowering mother. (5) Lisa Nakamura also reads Case as a crusader against encroaching Japanese- ness. In her book Cybertypes, she notes that while bodies are often an afterthought in Gibson’s work, race remains curiously foregrounded: “When the meat gets left behind, in theory so does race, but these 1980s cyberpunk narratives have so much invested in the idea of their white heroes as American underdogs that they must keep racial boundaries intact” (66; emphasis in original). Nakamura forgoes the subtlety of Chun’s exoticist critique, casting Neuromancer—and early Western cyberpunk in toto—as a panicked attempt to preserve the status quo by reasserting race as an essential category. In her view, “cybertechnology,” with its infinite potential for dissolving boundaries, poses a threat to the racial distinctions so central to certain old-fashioned, Eurocentric ideologies. Gibson’s fiction, she maintains, defangs this threat by depicting a technologized future in which race and its accompanying baggage are still front and center. While non-white characters are present in abundance, they are consistently relegated to peripheral roles—“cybertypecast” as villains and sidekicks. For all the multi-cultural window dressing, it is still the white cowboy who holds the reins:  The only thing protecting American democracy and individualism from total destruction by the rhizomatic “evil empire” of orientalist commerce is the lone hacker. In order for this representative of the Western frontier and way of life, the cowboy, to police and reform muddled borders and reclaim America from the zaibatsus, he must be presented to us as unproblematically white. Hence the ubiquity of the oriental foil.... (68)  Observable in these analyses is an increasingly acrid indictment of Neuromancer as something akin to protectionist cyberporn. Even in Morley and Robins’s comparatively restrained critique, it is taken for granted that Gibson’s motive in making Japan the cradle of the future is to undermine its status as such. Seemingly, Chun and Nakamura consider this to be the novel’s whole hook. As superficially persuasive as these interpretations might be, they are also </page> <page sequence="6"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 483 myopic, overreaching, and curiously oblivious to the text they seek to pigeonhole. As I will demonstrate, a careful study of the actual text is all that is required to problematize its techno-orientalist reputation. Both Chun and Nakamura identify in Neuromancer an antagonistic relationship between Case, the novel’s Caucasian hacker protagonist, and certain clandestine networks of Japanese corporate power. The implication is that Case primarily occupies himself with the patriotic subversion of Japanese economic interests, or that he did until “the Yakuza ... altered his system so that [he] could no longer jack into cyberspace” (Chun 5). In fact, the novel offers no evidence of this. Case is a hacker, a console cowboy who once eked out his living thieving “for other wealthier thieves” (Gibson 5). His employers “provided the exotic software required to penetrate the bright walls of corporate systems, opening windows into rich fields of data” (5). Nowhere are the victims of Case’s former info-larceny identified more specifically than this—“corporate systems” and “rich fields of data.” To go from this vague bit of backstory to explicitly labeling him “a warrior against Japanese capitalism” (Nakamura 65) seems like overstatement, at best. At no point in the novel is Case seen breaking into a Japanese system. Nakamura seemingly bases her assertion on the fact that major corporations in Gibson’s fiction are often referred to by the Japanese term zaibatsu. There is every indication, however, that the term is a loan word, used generically to refer to corporate conglomerates, and not a designator of national affinity.1  At the novel’s outset, this is more or less moot. Case is neurologically crippled, unable to hack anything, zaibatsu or otherwise. His central nervous system has been sabotaged, preventing him from entering cyberspace at all. The nerve damage is the work of a chemical agent forcibly administered by a group of former employers he tried to swindle. In her essay, Chun curiously identifies the employers in question as the Yakuza—Japan’s answer to the Mafia and a cyberpunk staple. Once again, however, there is little in the text to justify the leap. The identity of those who crippled Case is left deliberately obscure. They are referred to only as “his employers” (5), his “former employers” (46), and “the men who crippled him in Memphis” (203). Though the Yakuza’s influence is global in Gibson’s books, one is not quick to associate them with Tennessee. It is worth noting that Case did all his early hacking in the Sprawl, the vaguely defined urban space between Manhattan and Atlanta. He only arrives in Chiba after his chemical maiming, intent on finding an antidote. Far from a monolithic threat, he perceives Japan as his last, best hope for salvation: “In Japan, he’d known with a clenched and absolute certainty, he’d find his cure” (6).  Given even casual scrutiny, the notion of Neuromancer as a tale of American triumph over a sinister, oriental Other largely implodes. This allegedly central conflict is all but absent in the text, and requires some rather selective reading to locate in the subtext. In fact, essentially every antagonist Case faces in the novel is “unproblematically white.” Wage, the Chiba hustler he is fleeing in the first chapter, is described as a “gaijin dealer” (11)—another foreigner in Japan. Armitage, his mysterious, mentally unstable benefactor, is a caricature of Aryan militarism: khaki-clad, perpetually unsmiling, with “blue eyes so pale they made </page> <page sequence="7"> 484 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) Case think of bleach” (27). The novel’s most clearly villainous characters, it seems, are also the most European. The Parisian Turing cops are a prominent adversary, as is Peter Riviera, the blonde, German-born illusionist. And then there is the Tessier-Ashpool clan, the overseers of Freeside, “a family inbred and most carefully refined” (101). The T-A clan is a grotesque parody of eccentric, European aristocracy—obscenely wealthy, decadent, and incestuous. Their nationality is never clearly defined (they seem to have outgrown the concept), but it is apparent what Gibson means to suggest with a name like “Lady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool” (139). Were Neuromancer written today, one might easily take it as a paranoid allegory for the growing global influence of the EU.  I am wary of overstating my objections here; I do not mean entirely to dismiss techno-orientalism as a concept, or even its bearing on Gibson’s work. Undoubtedly, the author is guilty of stereotyping and exoticism in his use of Japanese imagery, and a more a restrained look at the techno-orientalist aspects of Neuromancer could be both productive and appropriate. My concern with the readings of Chun, Nakamura, et al. is that they suffer from something like critical tunnel vision. Though Neuromancer cannot be divorced altogether from the political climate of the 1980s, neither should that be the solitary lens through which its treatment of Japan is viewed. Given Gibson’s expatriation and professed political neutrality as an author, it would seem folly to ascribe an ethos of US protectionism to his work.2 As he has remarked: “If an author's politico-religio-social agenda is what directly drives the work ... no genuinely valuable interrogation of reality can take place” (“Thursday”). Similarly, the push to marginalize Neuromancer as brazen Japan-bashing has arguably impeded more valuable interrogation of the novel’s take on Japanese futurity. It has not, however, entirely stifled other views. In an ambitious essay entitled “The Future: ‘Wrapped ... in that mysterious Japanese way,’” Joshua La Bare diverges at least in part from the readings previously discussed. At the article’s outset, he identifies three strains of Japanese imagery dominant in Gibson’s work and late-twentieth-century sf overall, labeling them “high technology, the alien, and the apocalypse” (23). Though he never cites Morley and Robins, his exhaustive taxonomy of the first two of these tropes amounts to an essentially techno-orientalist critique. The gist is familiar: by repeatedly linking the Japanese with androids and aliens, Western authors have branded them both eerily transhuman and mechanically subhuman. For all their techno- wizardry, the Japanese remain “single-minded and unexpressive, lacking emotion, robot-like in their inflexibility” (26). As such, they project an uncanny Otherness against which Western protagonists can be conveniently defined. On this point, La Bare’s argument neatly prefigures Nakamura’s: The hacker—Gibson’s “cyberspace cowboy”—is the ultimate wild-card frontiersman in our contemporary imaginations: one more Western hero to bolster our morale against any implacable, robotic (Japanese) threat. (31) This is well-trodden ground, but La Bare laudably branches out in the essay’s final third, with an innovative riff on “apocalyptic” Japanese imagery. </page> <page sequence="8"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 485 Post-nuclear paranoia does not carry the weight it once did in sf, having subsided somewhat with the thaw of the Cold War and the advent of nano- and biotech bogeymen. Bruce Sterling identifies “boredom with the Apocalypse” (“Preface” xi) as a cyberpunk hallmark, and La Bare suggests the Japanese are beloved by the genre’s luminaries for precisely this reason. They, too, have left behind the end times, but literally. Japan survived its Armageddon, recovering handily from the nuclear devastation of WWII to scale the economic heights described earlier. In sf literature and film, the nation has endured near-total annihilation by natural disasters, psychic teens, radioactive lizards, and a host of comparable A-Bomb metaphors. And yet, both onscreen and off, its people have unfailingly risen from the ashes to rebuild. La Bare elaborates: “The Japanese represent not only the apocalypse, but the fact of its transcendence: the finite, and through it, the infinite” (43).3 Tokyo scholar Takayuki Tatsumi has praised Gibson’s work for capturing precisely this aspect of the “mental history of the postwar Japanese, characterized by concepts such as creative defeat” (Full Metal 120). For the purposes of this piece, Tatsumi’s essay “The Japanese Reflection of Mirrorshades” might be the most valuable gloss on Gibson’s Japan to date. Predating Morley and Robins, the essay focuses primarily on Neuromancer but eschews anything like a techno-orientalist or Japanophobic reading of the text, considering instead its translation and popular reception in Japan. According to Tatsumi, its arrival there gave a name to something already happening, unheralded, between the cultural cracks: Neuromancer not only imported the idea of cyberpunk, but also helped disclose various simultaneous happenings that had remained unnoticed.... The imported term “cyberpunk” ... came to refer to anything having to do with dead-tech environment, hypermedia activity, and outlaw technologists. (“Japanese Reflection” 370) Though Gibson’s portrayal of Japan is fundamentally a Westerner’s misperception, Tatsumi contends “translation is another name for misperception” (372). As the process of translation often brings to the fore qualities latent in the original text, Gibson’s outsider perspective “encouraged Japanese readers to correctly perceive the nature of postmodernist Japan” (372). The degree of seriousness with which Tatsumi intends this claim to be taken is debatable, but Neuromancer has undoubtedly left its mark on Japan’s pop- cultural self-image.  The strength of La Bare’s and Tatsumi’s analyses is that they acknowledge both Gibson’s tendency toward stereotypes and the possibility that this tendency stems from something other than xenophobic maliciousness.4 To be sure, Neuromancer is rife with imagery few would deem PC. The vat-grown ninjas and Yakuza “Zen spiders” (177) that populate the novel are far from sensitive portraits of Japan’s people and culture. And yet, while techno-orientalism provides a handy label for such imagery, it is limited in its ability to account for it. The socioeconomic tensions from which the discourse arose are now a distant memory. In 1990, the Japanese stock market bottomed out, the first in a battalion of economic sorrows. By 1995, The New York Times was reporting: </page> <page sequence="9"> 486 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) “This is just not the same Godzilla that was eating our lunch” (Passell). Reports of the nation’s robotic invincibility were obviously exaggerated. In a post-bubble addendum to their essay, Morley and Robins concede as much: “As we move into the mid-1990’s, some of the paranoia of recent years concerning the Japanese ‘economic miracle’ seems to be fading” (173). But as the alleged danger from Japan subsided, Gibson’s insistence on a Japanese future endured. Clearly, in considering his use of the motif, one must move beyond Neuromancer and beyond Japan Panic. Bang, We’re Doing Late Capitalism. Writing on Gibson’s Pattern Recognition (2003), Fredric Jameson hones in on the book’s highly codified descriptive argot of brand names and product specs. He claims this “hyped-up namedropping” (“Fear” 108) of items real and invented has a special resonance in the post- millennial collective unconscious, which he dubs the “eBay imaginary” (108). If his primary intent with this term is to suggest a mental schema boiled down from catalog blurbs—“an encyclopedic familiarity with the fashions of world space” (108)—its usefulness extends far beyond that. Few phrases could better fit the garage-sale-in-cyberspace aesthetic Gibson has cultivated throughout his oeuvre.5 By his own admission, the author is a former eBay junkie, and once chronicled his addiction in a piece for WIRED magazine. In the article, he touches on the overlap between eBay’s secondhand eclecticism and his own fictional trashscapes:  I find clutter, in my personal environment, oppressive. But crazed environments of dead tech and poignant rubbish turn up in my fiction on a regular basis, where they are usually presented as being at once comforting, evocative, and somehow magical. The future as flea market. I really do tend to see the future that way.... (“My Obsession” 5) Flea market futurity and the future as the privileged domain of the Japanese are two of the author’s most consistent, characteristic motifs. I believe the two are closely interrelated, and by the end of this essay, I will attempt to demonstrate exactly how. In Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1991), Jameson singles out cyberpunk—and Gibson’s fiction in particular—as the literary mode best suited to narrativizing “the whole new decentered global network of the third stage of capital” (38). Scott Bukatman notes that “Neuromancer was uncannily anticipated by Jameson’s 1984 essay on postmodernism” (147), and indeed, there is significant overlap between Gibson’s and Jameson’s respective diagnoses of the postmodern condition. In fact, the two have been known to invoke each another’s work when expounding their own ideas. Ruminating on those hyperreal qualities of the contemporary that inform his writing, Gibson observes:  The non-mediated world has become a lost country. And I think that, in some very real way, it’s a country we cannot find our way back to.... It’s like Fredric Jameson’s postmodern divide. That sense of loss and a sense of Christmas morning at the same time. (No Maps) </page> <page sequence="10"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 487 In turn, Jameson borrows a phrase from Gibson to denote the divide in question: “When-it-all-changed” (Postmodernism ix). While obviously different in approach, the authors share similar thematic obsessions: transnational capital, technologies of reproduction, the waning of affect, the evolution of urban space. Most crucially, both trace the “consumption of sheer commodification as a process” (x) to a deteriorating sense of history.  Jameson posits the disappearance of the past as one of the defining symptoms of the postmodern era. Where history once served as a common denominator—a stable point of reference against which to measure the present—it has now been rendered all but inaccessible by the rise of representation. In the postmodern world, “the past as ‘referent’ finds itself gradually bracketed, and then effaced altogether, leaving us with nothing but texts” (Postmodernism 18). The historical has been reduced to “a vast collection of images, a multitudinous photographic simulacrum” (18). Engaging it in any meaningful sense is impossible, but the drive to do so remains stronger than ever. Thus, the emergence of historical prostheses—the heritage industry, Hollywood remakes, faux antique furniture, an endless series of stylizations circulated and sold as “history,” but almost entirely devoid of it. Jameson regards sf as a byproduct of this historical amnesia, claiming the genre “corresponds to the waning or blockage of ... historicity, and, particularly in our own time ... to its crisis and paralysis, its enfeeblement and repression” (284). In certain cases, sf texts can permit a partial recovery of historicity by facilitating a conception of the present as history. Take, for instance, STAR TREK, in which the people of the twenty-third century display a dogged preoccupation with the late twentieth. However, Jameson suggests the cyberpunk genre—which looks ever more like “an outright representation of the present”—depicts “simply an ultimate historicist breakdown” (286).  This is everywhere apparent in Gibson’s work, in which characters rarely refer to any recognizable past, despite the temporal proximity of the futures they inhabit.6 The SPRAWL series spans a deliberately uncertain portion of the twenty- first century, as striking for its likeness to the present as for its densely layered novums and neologisms. There are references to the past, but a recent past that never comes fully into focus. Its contours are merely implied through enigmatic scraps of description and dialogue. An unnamed pandemic has caused the extinction of horses. World War III has come and gone, lasting only three weeks. World War II is granted only an obscure, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it mention by the Finn, in Count Zero (1986): “There were cowboys ever since there were computers. They built the first computers to crack German ice. Right?” (118). To situate the narrative on any kind of real-world timeline, one must triangulate from details as minor as this. By contrast, the BRIDGE TRILOGY unfolds in a nearer future, marked by more familiar signposts.7 Its theme bars, rock stars, and Internet subcultures differ from contemporary analogs only by degree. It is, essentially, the Turn of the Millennium turned up to eleven. This is conveyed in Idoru (1996) when Laney flashes back to his SlitScan days:  </page> <page sequence="11"> 488 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) [SlitScan] was descended from “reality” programming and the network tabloids of the late twentieth century, but it resembled them no more than some large, swift bipedal carnivore resembled its sluggish, shallow-dwelling ancestors. (50) A sort of paramilitary paparazzi outfit, SlitScan is a global media juggernaut boasting its own satellites and virtually limitless means. It has grown so vast that it has actually spawned “meta-tabloids,” or “show[s] about shows like SlitScan” (90; emphasis in original), in an infinite regress of celebrity dirt-dishing. Most telling, its 24/7 cycle of image consumption is held to have “replaced history” (51). The BRIDGE TRILOGY far surpasses the SPRAWL series in specific references to the historical past, but they tend to bubble up through a heavily mediated haze. Chia, for instance, has “only a vague idea who Hitler might have been, and that mainly from references in songs” (Idoru 46).  This absence of an unmediated past complicates Gibson’s use of “traditional” Japanese imagery by an order of magnitude. Nakamura argues that the allure of such images in Neuromancer is that “in a world gone artificial they represent the natural, the authentic, the rare, the exotic” (69). The T-A clan’s vat-grown assassin is a status symbol because he “gestures toward a ‘real’ Japanese past” (69). Her reading is tough to reconcile, however, with the apparent inaccessibility of any “real” past, Japanese or otherwise. An abundance of evidence would suggest there is no such thing to gesture toward—in Gibson’s terms, there is no there there. For example, femme fatale Molly Millions (a.k.a. Sally Shears) is professionally termed a “street samurai”—another allusion to premodern Japan. And yet, when Kumiko ponders the connection in Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), her thoughts turn not to feudalism but film: Perhaps, Kumiko decided, Sally had once been something along ronin lines, a kind of samurai ... she found herself imagining this younger Sally as a bishonen hero in a traditional romantic video: fey, elegant, and deadly. (167) Once again, history is occluded by representation. Detached from the historical past, the “samurai” gets repackaged as a product—a film genre, an anime hero, a tag for Molly’s hired muscle biz. It is attractive not for its denotation of authentic Japaneseness, but for its connotation of media-perpetuated bushido myths. As history disappears into the product cycle, its zero point closes in, ever more rapidly, on the present. In the documentary film No Maps for These Territories (2000), Gibson comments on the contemporary movement toward this end. Even now, he muses, the pace of the market has in some sense outstripped time:  It took two or three years for whatever was happening in the 60’s to be commodified as the 60’s experience. It took only about a year for punk to be commodified in the same way. And that bohemia that Kurt Cobain came out of ... was commodified almost before it was born. It was like the equivalent of veal. (No Maps) In All Tomorrow’s Parties (1999), the final chapter of the BRIDGE TRILOGY, this trend is seen through to its inevitable conclusion. The bohemias of which Gibson speaks—oases of unmediated authenticity flowering somewhere off the </page> <page sequence="12"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 489 grid—have been cool-hunted to extinction. Cody Harwood, the novel’s antagonist, provides a capsule history: Bohemias. Alternative subcultures. They were a crucial aspect of industrial civilization.... But they became extinct.... We started picking them before they could ripen. A certain crucial growing period was lost, as marketing evolved and the mechanisms of recommodification became quicker, more rapacious. (176) This state of affairs has given rise to the trilogy’s titular bridge—the San Franciso-Oakland Bay Bridge in San Francisco, which has been transformed into a lawless shantytown. It is one of many government-mandated “autonomous zones” designed to absorb the now-unmarketable oddballs and discontents who would have once occupied a bohemian enclave. Its inhabitants wring their livelihood from castoff parts and industrial refuse. Just as the marketers, who drained the lifeblood from everything authentic, now endlessly recycle the past, the bridge community is continually reconstituted from “rain-silvered plywood, broken marble ... corrugated plastic, polished brass, sequins, painted canvas...” (Virtual Light 70). Like Kurt Schwitters’s Merzbau (1923-37), it is an organic environment, constantly evolving. This Dada connection is made explicit by Yamazaki, the bridge-obsessed Japanese sociologist, in Virtual Light. He deems the bridge community a most magnificent “Thomasson,” a cryptic term coined by the Japanese writer Genpei Akasegawa “to signify a phase of the Japanese neo-Dadaistic movement that he championed” (Tatsumi, Full Metal Apache112). Thomasson was an American ballplayer drafted to great fanfare by the Yomiuri Giants, who learned only too late that he could not hit. Akasegawa adopted his name to refer to “junk-art-like junk objects scattered all over the cityscape” (119).  It is an obscure allusion, but far from unique. Toward the end of Neuromancer, as Molly works her way through the Villa Straylight—the heavily fortified compound of the Tessier-Ashpool clan—she happens upon Marcel Duchamp’s great masterwork “The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even” (1915-23). On one level, this objet d’ art links the T-A clan’s reclusive eccentricity with Duchamp’s special brand of the same, but it also connotes concepts like montage, collage, and assemblage—aesthetic strategies of Dada and surrealism that have come to characterize the postmodern era. Gibson’s cut- and-paste style is arguably consistent with these; the borrowed components of his prose have indeed been exhaustively catalogued: the info-density of Pynchon, the body horror of Ballard, John Shirley’s rock ’n’ roll sneer, “the streetwise weariness of Chandler and the neologistic prowess of William Burroughs” (Bukatman 146). Perhaps the author himself puts it best:  I see myself as a kind of literary collage-artist, and SF as a marketing framework that allows me to gleefully ransack the whole fat supermarket of 20th century cultural symbols. (qtd. in Olsen 32)  Many of Gibson’s characters share his aptitude for collage, adopting the art as a means to navigate the “crazed environments of dead tech and poignant rubbish” (“My Obsession” 6) through which they make their way. Perhaps none is more memorable than the mystery artist at the heart of Count Zero. At the </page> <page sequence="13"> 490 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) novel’s outset, gallery owner Marly Krushkhova is hired by an eccentric billionaire to trace the origins of a striking, Joseph Cornell-style box collage. Upon first sight of it, Marly is smitten:  The slender fluted bone... Three archaic circuit boards, faced with mazes of gold. A smooth white sphere of baked clay. An age-blackened fragment of lace. A finger-length segment of what she assumed was bone from a human wrist, grayish white, inset smoothly with the silicon shaft of a small instrument... The box was a universe, a poem... (15) These elements are juxtaposed in a classically surrealist manner, hermetically sealed under glass. The faux-Cornell becomes the novel’s McGuffin, leading Marly to the deserted husk of the Villa Straylight. There she finally meets the maker: a many-armed construction remote, designed for orbital maintenance, now inhabited by the godlike AI set loose at the end of Neuromancer. In the Straylight’s abandoned data cores, it picks through the artifacts of Tessier- Ashpool’s storied past, boxing them up in endless configurations. This collage artist AI is among Gibson’s most potent images.8 One might easily read the machine as analogous to the author—crafting texts from cultural detritus and setting them adrift like corked messages. Bruce Sterling has even termed the author’s junkyard backdrops “Gibson boxes,” deeming them a distinctive sf device (No Maps). As mentioned previously, the Bridge community would be one such Gibson box, jury-rigged from Bay Area salvage. The inverted killfile of Walled City, with its “texture maps that constantly unravel” (193), is another, mirroring a Hong Kong megaslum in the virtual realm.9 While outwardly derelict, these places are among the most alive in Gibson’s work, their vitality derived from their recombinant architecture. In an atemporal, flea-market future, the repurposing of free-floating signifiers is more than a necessary evil. Skillfully retrofitting the past for the present confers a Darwinian edge.  By this metric, Japan—in many ways the ultimate Gibson box —is portrayed as supremely fit to survive. At first glance, the neon gloss of Tokyo seems to have little in common with the favela chic of the Bridge community, but the author takes pains to draw explicit parallels. In the BRIDGE TRILOGY series, both have risen from the settled dust of major earthquakes, affectionately dubbed Godzilla and the Little Grande. The bridge was rebuilt “piecemeal, to no set plan ... the result was something amorphous, startlingly organic” (Virtual Light 69). The Gigeresque, self-assembling skyscrapers of post-quake Tokyo similarly possess a “streamlined organicism” (108). As Tatsumi observes, “the self- recycling logic of Thomassonianism naturally jeopardizes the distinctions between technopolis and junkyard” (Full Metal 120). Like the bridge dwellers, the Japanese emerge throughout Gibson’s fiction as highly adept at pastiche, collage, recombination. La Bare suggests that the “Japanese reverence for the past” (43) is key to their futurity, but “reverence” might be too weighty a word. In Gibson’s work, the Japanese honor history not through solemn observance but, like the author himself, via gleeful ransacking. The notion of historical authenticity (or any other sort) holds no special privilege—the past is revered in the sense that it is voraciously consumed and redeployed as product.  </page> <page sequence="14"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 491 Consider, for instance, gomi. The word is Japanese, meaning garbage, rubbish, refuse. In Gibson’s futures it means the same, but like zaibatsu, it has worked its way into the global vernacular. Rubin of “The Winter Market” is an artisan of the stuff, and the story equates his way with gomi to that of the Japanese:  The Japanese, a century ago, had already run out of gomi space around Tokyo, so they came up with a plan for creating space out of gomi ... they built themselves a little island in Tokyo Bay out of gomi and christened it Dream Island. But the city was still pouring out its nine thousand tons per day, so ... today they coordinate the whole process, and new Nippons rise out of the Pacific. (Burning Chrome 120) This is the junk construction of the Bridge community, but hyperrationalized and massive in scope—eBay to the Bridge people’s ongoing garage sale. The project’s vast scale is mentioned in Mona Lisa Overdrive. While casually studying the litter in London, Kumiko reflects: “thirty five percent of the landmass of Tokyo was built on gomi, on level tracts reclaimed from the Bay through a century’s systematic dumping” (161). This landfill reclamation gets revived for the self-recycling Tokyo of the BRIDGE TRILOGY. As Maryalice tells Chia: “They pushed all the quake-junk into the water ... and now they’re building that up, too. New islands” (Idoru 50). It is nothing less than alchemy for the twenty-first century: trash transmuted into Tokyo real estate.  The gomi isles represent a material repurposing of the past, but the Japanese are equally skilled at imbuing high-tech simulacra with a “connotation of ‘pastness’ and pseudohistorical depth” (Jameson, Postmodernism 20). As mentioned earlier, the so-called traditional Japanese symbols so prevalent in Gibson’s work are really nothing of the sort. Invariably, they are commodified images, and it is arguably for this reason that they tend toward stereotypes. Nakamura singles out Hideo, the Tessier-Ashpools’ house ninja, for abuse, decrying him as “a corny, cliché-ridden [depiction] of the Asian warrior” (69). This is a fair assessment, but Nakamura fails to consider adequately the ninja’s commodity status. Contrary to her assertions, Hideo is not a relic from an authentic Japanese past but a bleeding-edge consumer tech—a vat-grown clone and home security solution for the frighteningly wealthy. His standing as product is never in question: “You figure they own that ninja, Finn?” Molly asked. “Smith thought so.”  “Expensive,” she said. “Wonder whatever happened to that little ninja, Finn?”  “Probably got him on ice. Thaw when needed.” (Neuromancer 76) It is hardly surprising that a high-end home defense ninja would conform so closely to clichéd images already circulating in the global pop consciousness. This would seem, from a consumer standpoint, to be attractive packaging. Like a villain from one of Kumiko’s videos, Hideo is a manufactured image of an imagined past—an amalgam of media stereotypes. That he lacks in “real” Japaneseness is obviously by design. </page> <page sequence="15"> 492 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) A worthwhile comparison here is with another simulacrum from the SPRAWL series—Colin the “chipghost” of Mona Lisa Overdrive. An anthropomorphic, artificially-intelligent guide program, Colin is a gift to Kumiko from her father, intended to keep her company on her trip to London. In this scenario, the race roles are reversed—in lieu of a synthetic Japanese in European servitude, a synthetic European is at the beck and call of a Japanese. Colin appears whenever Kumiko summons him, “to aid and advise the Japanese visitor in the United Kingdom” (196), dispensing info on local customs, architecture, etc. He has also been tailored to “mirror the visitor’s expectations” (262), manifesting as a precocious, apple-cheeked Edwardian schoolboy of the sort omnipresent in a certain vintage of Disney movie: “A boy out of some faded hunting print, legs crossed casually in tan breeches and riding boots” (3). The British cowboy Tick remarks repeatedly on both the quality of Colin’s tech and the unit’s exorbitant price, though he is less impressed with the aesthetics: “What you are is some Jap designer’s idea of an Englishman!” (262).  Undoubtedly, the most remarkable Japanese assemblage in Gibson’s fiction would be the idoru, Rei Toei. The latter two thirds of the BRIDGE TRILOGY unfold in her shadow, or would, if she had one. Rei is an extrapolation of the idoru kashu, or idol singer phenomenon that has been a cornerstone of Japanese pop culture for the last thirty years. In America, there is no direct equivalent; Japanese idols are greater in number, shorter in half-life, and more transparently manufactured than their US counterparts. Rei Toei is the ultimate idoru by virtue of being the least authentic. Like Colin or Hideo she is an artificial being, “a personality-construct, a congeries of software agents, the creation of information-designers” (Idoru 121). Her intended function, however, is far more ambitious. Instead of offering a narrow set of services to a particular demographic, she has been designed for the entire world to fall in love with her. Laney observes:  As the amplified reflection of desire, she was a team effort; to the extent that her designers had done their jobs properly, she was a waking dream, a love object sprung from an approximation of the global mass unconscious. (All Tomorrow’s 164)  Rei is a work of collage, but not in any conventional sense. Where Hideo and Colin are cobbled together from various clichés, the idoru transcends her mimetic origins. Upon first hearing of her, Laney imagines an “industrial- strength synthesis of Japan’s last three dozen top female media faces” (Idoru 229), but she turns out to be more than a bland composite of former stars. Her substance is “aggregates of subjective desire, an architecture of articulated longing” (312). Laney, with his gift for info dowsing, is able to visualize her fabric: In the very structure of her face, in geometries of underlying bone, lay coded  histories of dynastic flight, privation, terrible migrations. He saw stone tombs in steep alpine meadows, their lintels traced with snow. A line of shaggy pack ponies, their breath white with cold, followed a trail above a canyon. (230) </page> <page sequence="16"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 493 These are images of history, but neither an authentic history nor even the caricatured approximations of Colin or Hideo. Like dreams, they are spontaneously generated from within the idoru, the atemporal “envoy of some imaginary country” (230). She is image in its purest state, the quintessential fourth-order simulacrum. She is the perfect copy with no corresponding original. “When the real world is transformed into mere images, mere images become real beings” (Debord par. 18). In Gibson’s work, the idoru is the forward guard of the future; and the Japanese build it without concern for the unities it severs or dichotomies it blurs. Is Rei Toei a techno-orientalist image? Arguably, yes, but it would be woefully reductive to regard her only as such. Her ethnicity is nominal; she hails from a non-existent country. Her constituent parts are global in origin. She is post- national, post-human, and definitively postmodern, a product tailored to “consumers’ appetite for a world transformed into sheer images” (Jameson, Postmodernism 18). Gibson’s implication is that Japan is poised to prosper in such a world. Confronted with the idoru’s synthetic dreams, Laney seizes up, “in his mouth a taste of rotten metal” (Gibson, Idoru 230). Rei’s handlers, though, simply splice the images into her music videos—that most commercial strain of collage. As Mr. Kuwayama, her creator, explains: “It is about futurity, Mr. Laney.... And popular culture is the testbed of our futurity” (314). Post-national Cool. In evaluating Gibson’s appropriation of Japan, it is useful to consider Japan’s appropriation of Gibson. Critics who would reduce the author’s use of Japanese imagery to techno-orientalist exoticism or xenophobic paranoia tend to ignore the enthusiastic reception cyberpunk has met with in Japan. Bruce Sterling, in his introduction to the very influential Mirrorshades anthology (1986), mentions that Tokyo’s Hayakawa’s SF Magazine “was the first publication ever to produce an ‘all-cyberpunk’ issue’” (xii). In 1983, Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982), that other infamously techno-orientalist cyberpunk text, won a Seiun award—Japan’s equivalent to the Hugo or Nebula. In 1987, Neuromancer added a Seiun to its list of accolades. Gibson recalls the Japanese reveling in their sf reflection:  I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya, when one of the young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns ... said, “You see? You see? It is Blade Runner town.” And it was. It so evidently was. (“Future Perfect”) Tatsumi observes that “the junk artist immediately becomes the raw material of junk art” (Full Metal 111), and so it went with Gibson and Japan. “Cyberpunk ... immediately appealed to a Japanese sensibility that had been nurtured on science fiction manga and Japanese animation” (Bolton ix), and the nation soon became a prolific producer of its own postmodernist cyberpunk texts. Today, such names as Otomo, Shirow, and Oshii are as synonymous with the genre as Sterling or Gibson. What is more, these artists’ major works have reflected—and in fascinating ways borne out—Gibson’s portrayal of Japan as a model of postmodern cultural savvy. </page> <page sequence="17"> 494 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) Katsuhiro Otomo’s Akira first appeared in 1982, a couple of years prior to Neuromancer. The manga was serialized in Kodansha’s biweekly Young Magazine, where its epic story took shape over the course of ten years and two- thousand-some pages. Toward the middle of its run, Otomo found time to adapt the series into a wildly ambitious animated film—the most expensive anime ever produced. In 1988, Akira, the movie, hit Japanese screens, going on to become the year’s biggest domestic hit. This home court success earned it a limited theatrical release overseas, which was all but unheard of for an anime feature. The movie sold out art houses and garnered an enthusiastic cult following. It also drew some mainstream praise: Janet Maslin hailed it “a phenomenal work of animation” and Roger Ebert aimed his thumb skyward (Siskel and Ebert at the Movies, 1989).  If Akira’s origins cannot be traced directly to Western cyberpunk, the movie’s aesthetic and overall sensibility owe it more than a little. In his comprehensive Blade Runner handbook Future Noir (1996), Paul Sammon identifies Otomo’s Neo Tokyo as “the Far East equivalent of [Ridley] Scott’s 2019 Los Angeles” (324), and the likeness cannot be overlooked. Otomo stops short of calling it an homage but does acknowledge the thematic overlap: “[Akira is] like Blade Runner and cyberpunk. I think it shared those worldwide visions, all right” (Akira DVD). For Western genre fans were primed by cyberpunk fiction to receive it, and the film’s subcultural impact was considerable. In the years following its release, Akira became the de facto face of anime outside Japan, spawning a niche market for “Japanimation” (as it was then popularly known). Andrew Osmond of Animerica recounts: “Armageddon, teenage bikers, neon-lit megacities, psychic duels and ‘Not for Kids’ stickers. All these things came to define the Western image of anime, thanks to Akira” (6).  Of course, anime is simply another creative medium, and can no more be reduced to a single, representative genre than can film itself. As Western distributors scrambled to fill a demand for more films like Akira, however, the medium did acquire a reputation as something like cartoon cyberpunk. For about a decade, what little anime breached the shelves of Blockbuster was rarely more than a couple of degrees removed from Otomo’s dystopia, tending toward titles like Armitage III (1995), Appleseed (2004), AD Police (1994), Bubblegum Crisis (1987-91), Battle Angel Alita (1993), Gunsmith Cats (1995), Cyber City Oedo 808 (1990), etc.10 Though popular perceptions of the era cannot be readily quantified, it is telling that, even now, some English dictionaries define anime as characterized by “futuristic settings, violence, and sexuality” (anime).  Unsurprisingly, when a film finally came along to rival Akira as the Western world’s gateway anime, it was even more thoroughly a work of cyberpunk. In 1996, Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell became the first animated Japanese film to open simultaneously in theaters worldwide—a reflection of the medium’s growing popularity. The film follows a futuristic police unit called Section 9 on their hunt for the Puppet Master—a hacker with a seemingly supernatural knack for invading systems and evading capture. The movie is based on a manga by Masamune Shirow but differs from it in many respects. Where Shirow’s comic </page> <page sequence="18"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 495 is a humorous, hyperkinetic affair, Oshii’s adaptation is comparatively ponderous and elegiac. The diegesis splits the difference between Blade Runner and Neuromancer, borrowing the existential cop/android motif from the former and the AI-fusing climax from the latter. The future it depicts is even more Gibsonian than that of Akira.11 It is more cosmopolitan, and far more deeply steeped in issues of mind/body tension, invasive tech, and simulation.  Several years ago, The New York Times hailed Ghost in the Shell as one of “the finest Japanese films of the last two decades” (Kehr). This is effusive praise, but even more striking was the title of the piece in which it appeared: “Anime, Japanese Cinema’s Second Golden Age.” Over the course of the past decade, this formerly obscure, niche-market medium has broken wide in the West, and now verges on mass-market ubiquity. In the introduction to her well- known critical survey Anime: From Akira to Princess Mononoke (2001), Susan Napier asserts: “Through anime Japan has become an increasingly significant player in the global cultural economy” (5). This claim has been echoed by a deluge of media commentary citing the country’s cartoon boom as both a root cause and leading symptom of a growing global appetite for Japanese cultural output. The line is that, since the bubble burst in the early 1990s, Japan has been slowly reinventing itself as an exporter of culture—anime and manga, most visibly, but also music, videogames, fashion, food, art, and architecture. The revenues from such exports have reportedly increased by 300% over just ten years (Faiola). While still a minor fraction of the overall GNP, this stunning growth has not gone unnoticed. Time Asia observes that “[E]ven as Japan’s economic leadership has been slipping for more than a decade, its cultural hegemony has only swelled” (Frederick 1).  The media attention to this trend can be traced back to a waves-making Foreign Policy article by Douglas McGray, entitled “Japan’s Gross National Cool.” Published in 2002, the article makes the case that Japan’s future lies in its newfound cachet as a global tastemaker. In other words, pop culture is to contemporary Japan what computer chips and Toyotas were to Japan in the 1980s—a potent source of leverage on the world stage. To borrow a phrase, it has become the testbed of the nation’s futurity. McGray asserts that Japan is “one of a handful of perfect globalization nations,” due primarily to its unique capacity to absorb, remix, and redeploy foreign influences. The strength of its popular culture is not its authentic Japaneseness, but its near-total lack thereof. Among the Japanese, McGray notes: “[I]t seems almost a strange point of pride ... to argue just how little Japan there is in modern Japan. Ironically, that may be a key to the spread of Japanese cool.” Where America’s pop culture tends to come weighted with certain values, Japan’s is far less prescriptive. McGray cites Sanrio’s ubiquitous yet eerily vacant Hello Kitty as an example. The mouthless, perpetually blank-faced icon operates on a Rei Toei-like level of pure image, conveying nothing in particular.12 It is precisely this emptiness, however, that makes her so versatile. Hello Kitty can move any product, from shrimp chips to vibrators, anywhere in the world: </page> <page sequence="19"> 496 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) Hello Kitty is Western, so she will sell in Japan. She is Japanese, so she will sell in the West.... [This] is part of the genius behind Japanese cultural strength in a global era that has many countries nervous about cultural erosion. (McGray)  The Japanese aptitude for striking a balance between the global and the local has been ably demonstrated over centuries—the country has an extensive history of borrowing from abroad. From the Chinese writing system 1500 years ago to Western tech and government during the Meiji restoration, much of modern Japan’s cultural make-up has come from without. In his introduction to the anthology Re-Made in Japan, Joseph Tobin remarks: “The Japanese are known to themselves and to others as an imitative people.... The genius of the Japanese lies not in invention but in adaptation” (3). This may not seem a terribly flattering appraisal. To suggest the Japanese are “an imitative people” is arguably no less demeaning than deeming them a race of diligent robots. As Tobin notes, this characterization tends to cast them as either “passive victims of Chinese and then Western cultural domination or ... underhanded agents of cultural plagiarism” (3). The Japanese assimilation of foreign influences far transcends mere mimicry, however. There is always value added; the pastiche conveys more than the sum of its parts. In Gibson’s words, there is that “quality of a good translation that can never be captured in the original” (“Modern”).  It would of course be disingenuous to suggest that pop-cultural clout might be a magic bullet for the economic, political, and social ills still plaguing Japan today. Within a decade, the national economy—only now rebounding from the global financial crisis of 2007—seems destined to be overtaken by China’s. The government is still reeling from the 2009 ouster of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the most recent in a string of political upheavals. Perennial concerns about the nation’s regressive insularity, aging population, and bureaucratic inertia loom as large as ever. Against a backdrop of such turmoil, a notion like Gross National Cool can seem rather glib. Even so, it remains a silver lining in the national outlook—another potential victory for creative defeat. The cultural output it has engendered continues to shape the nation’s image abroad, selling Japan-as-hypermodern-metaphor to new audiences worldwide. Its fortunes in the new century are far from assured, but for the time being, Japan seems likely to remain “the global imagination’s default setting for the future” (Gibson, “Modern”).  Through thirty years of tireless insistence, and his unmistakable influence on both the creation and reception of certain landmark Japanese sf, William Gibson had a considerable hand in making it such. To claim that he has been chief architect of the nation’s futuristic image might not be wholly accurate, but neither would it be totally indefensible. Consider The Washington Post’s analysis of Gross National Cool: Japan’s emergence today as a cultural superpower is ... the product of various factors. In the United States, Japanese anime and manga, the key source of Japan’s newfound popularity, were embraced during the 1970s and 1980s by a fertile subculture of technology-minded Americans, some of whom went on to spark the dot-com explosion. (Faiola)  </page> <page sequence="20"> POST-NATIONAL COOL 497 “A fertile subculture of technology-minded Americans” would be a fair description of cyberpunk’s core audience, a connection not lost on media commentators. In 2001, WIRED, The Observer, and Time Asia all solicited pieces from Gibson on Japanese futurity. His angle varies from one periodical to the next, but his conclusion is essentially constant: come what may, Japan is finally “Home, at last, in the 21st Century” (“My Own” 119). NOTES 1. Consider that “zaibatsu” and “multinational” are used interchangeably: “Power, in Case's world, meant corporate power. The zaibatsus, the multinationals that shaped the course of human history, had transcended old barriers” (203). National borders, it would seem, were among those “old barriers.” Borders are not so much permeable, in the future of the SPRAWL series, as irrelevant. In Count Zero there is a reference to Third- World Africa as “so benighted that the concept of nation was still taken seriously” (121). 2. Nakamura labels Case a defender of American democracy, but the words “American” and “democracy” never appear in the novel—apparently a deliberate omission. On his blog, Gibson recounted: “One of the things I sniggered over, as I wrote Neuromancer, was that it would be impossible to prove, from textual evidence, that the USA still existed as a nation-state” (“Humility”). 3. To ground this in something more material and contemporary, witness the relative calm with which Japan has weathered the recent global economic crisis. “While European and American financial titans have teetered and collapsed, giant Japanese banking groups have stood relatively unscathed” (Fackler). Twenty years out from the burst of the bubble, the Japanese are seasoned veterans of economic apocalypse as well.  4. A proper census of stereotypes in Gibson’s fiction would leave few characters of any ethnicity untallied. Pulp caricatures are the author’s stock in trade. While the Japanese in Idoru (1996), for instance, are thinly-sketched schoolgirls and otaku, they commingle with an Australian ex-con, a switchblade-packing gang girl, taste-impaired Texans, and bumbling Russian mobsters. Three-dimensionality is in short supply. Almost unfailingly, though, the author renders his stereotyped supporting cast more vividly, and with greater sympathy, than his white male protagonists. Neuromancer even includes a self-referential gag admitting as much. In Riviera’s holographic tableau, Molly and Armitage are “caricatures in light, lifesize cartoons” (208), their features grotesquely exaggerated. Case, by contrast, is merely “a forgettable face beneath short dark hair,” Riviera having been “unable to find anything worthy of parody” (209). It has been frequently noted that the name Case implies emptiness. Far from all-American heroes, both he and his SPRAWL series corollary Laney are hollow men, defined by little but crippling addictions.  5. Not for nothing was the author’s first official presence on the web was a site called “William Gibson’s Yard Sale.” 6. It is also not for nothing his latest novel is titled Zero History (2010). 7. The settings are now the recent past. The first book in the series, Virtual Light (1993), is supposed to take place in 2005. 8. Apparently quite taken with it himself, Gibson revived the entire conceit in millennial guise for Pattern Recognition (2002). Here again, the emphasis on atemporality is noteworthy. A defining attribute of the footage—the viral video that drives the novel’s grail quest—is its total dearth of stylistic cues, making the mise-en- scène impossible to situate historically. “The one hundred and thirty-four previously </page> <page sequence="21"> 498 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) discovered fragments ... have yielded no period and no particular narrative direction” (24). 9. To observe how deeply Gibson’s Japan and his junk-city constructs are interconnected, one really need look no further than the acknowledgments page for Idoru. “Sogho [sic] Ishii, the Japanese director, introduced to me to Kowloon Walled City via the photographs of Ryuji Miyamoto.... [Walled City] eventually provided most of the texture for the Bridge in my novel Virtual Light” (ix).  10. Perspective for the uninitiated: Armitage III does, in fact, draw its title from Neuromancer. Bubblegum Crisis features a character named “Gibson” and a band called “The Replicants.” Battle Angel Alita was the inspiration for director James Cameron’s cyberpunk TV series Dark Angel (2000-2002). Appleseed is an adaptation of Shirow Masamune’s well-known cyberpunk manga. Gunsmith Cats gets referenced in Gibson’s All Tomorrow’s Parties, and Cyber City Oedo 808 can be glimpsed in the Johnny Mnemonic movie (1995). 11. A work of proud pastiche, Ghost in the Shell shares the ahistorical, postmodern world-view of Gibson’s sf. The same cannot be said of Akira—opening and closing with images of Tokyo wiped away by a mushroom cloud, Otomo’s film is shot through with a powerful sense of Japanese history and national identity. The movie’s focus on the 1964 Olympic stadium as a symbol of rebirth and renewal, however, does speak to the nation’s apocalyptic transcendence—clearly also of interest to the author.  12. Accordingly, Cayce Pollard, the brand-allergic heroine of Pattern Recognition, suffers no reaction to Kitty-chan’s image.

ABSTRACT This article reconsiders the role of Japan in the cyberpunk fiction of William Gibson. From his early short stories through the millennial BRIDGE TRILOGY, Gibson has long portrayed Japan as the cradle of modern futurity. Many critics have traced this to so-called “techno-orientalism” and the anti-Japanese sentiment pervasive in the West during Japan’s late-twentieth-century boom years. This article seeks to address the insufficiencies of such readings and offers an alternative interpretation of Gibson’s Japan, linking it to the author’s affinity for Dada, remix culture, and the writings of Fredric Jameson. The final section considers Gibson’s impact on Japan’s post-bubble emergence as a pop-cultural exporter—particularly the growing global ubiquity of manga and anime—and the question of the nation’s continued relevance in the twenty-first century.   </page> </plain_text>
