<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARAPPANS, OCHRE WARE AND THE COPPER HOARDS By Devendrá Handa In October, 1949 a new type of pottery ť ill-fired, thick, ochre washed ware - mainly bits with worn out edges which is now common- ly designated as Ochre Coloured Pottery (O. C. P. ) was excavated for the first time by B. B. Lai from Bisauli and Rajpur Parsu, two copper hoard sites in Badaun and Bijnor districts of U. P. Soundings were made at these places in order to affiliate the copper hoard implements to some definite culture if possible. The copper hoard implements found frpm time to time were regarded by Heine Geldern as 4 The archaeologi- cal traces of the Vedic Aryans Stuart Piggot supported him at first but later changed his view and regarded the copper tools as belonging to the Harappan refugees who moved east-ward after the break-up of the Harappan civilization. Lai made a typological and technological study of these copper implements and together with the evidences of Hastina- pura excavations, reached the conclusion that the tools belong neither to the Aryas nor to the Harappans but to altogether a different people - the ancestors of the Proto- Australoid tribes who occupied the region before the advent of the Painted Grey Ware ( PGW ) people. The copper hoard implements were tentatively associated with the ill-fired, oclire- washed thick ware which existed at Hastinapura also underlying the strata containing the PGW, which Lai associated with the early Aryans in India. The discovery of a copper hoard and the occurrence of some red pottery deep under the ground at Bahadarabad in 1952, the existence of similar pottery at Bhatpura and Manpur, possessing strong Harappan affinities and the evidence of a broken anthropomorphic figure in the Harappan levels at Lothal led Dr. Y. D. Sharma conclude that the Ochre ware culture together with its copper hoard was ' only a phase of Harappa ware ', the last phase of the eastern movement of the decaying Harappa culture. Revising his earlier stand lie now takes Manupur and Bhatpura to be the Harappan sites and thinks that the copper hoard implements ' were being supplied to the straggling Harappan people and others by local craftsmen'. The discovery and excavation of some Harappan and OCP sites have thrown some welcome light on the problem and a fresh interpretation of the available data has become a desideratum.</page><page sequence="2">Miscellanea 207 The ' family likeness' of some painted designs at Bara with those of a pre-Harappan culture at Kalibagan was recognised some time back. The pre-Harappan influence has been noted on the pottery found from Mudiala, Kalan and Kathpalon, two Harappan sites in Districts Ludhiana and Jullundur respectively. Baragaon in District Saharanpur has yielded a copper ring of the type reported from Pondi, Bahadarabad and Jorwe, anunslipped Ochre-coloured ware, ill-fired slipped ware as also the typical Harappan pottery with black painted designs on red surface with typical Harappan antiquities. The pottery shows pre-Harappan and Cemetery-H influences also. Another OOP site in the same district, Ambakheri, has also yielded pottery betraying Cemetery-H influence, Bara type of vases with flanged ruins and antiquities suggesting Harappan ancestry. According to S. P. Gupta, the Bahadarabad pottery assemblage includes both the Late Harappan and the O. C. Wares. How did the pre-Harappan and Cemetery-H elements mingle in the OCP ? What is the significance of the occurrence of Harappan and OC pottery together ? M. K. Dhavalikar has drawn certain conclusions from S. S. Sarkar's report on the skeletal remains of the Harappan civilization. One of the main conclusions is that the Harappans ( Indo-Caspians ) came here in three waves. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to think that the first wave pushed some of the pre-Harappan people (who lived at Kalibangan and elsewhere ) forward, or we may say that some of the pre-Harappan people who could not concile themselves with the new comers moved forward. They left their original homes like refugees and settled on the north-eastern fringes of the region occupied by the new-comers. They, however, did not remain totally uninfluenced by the Harappans. That is why we see a co-mingling of the pre- Harappan and Harappan traits at Mudiala, Kalan, Kathpalon, etc. Being the settlement of refugees they did not flourish much and remained comparatively small towns where poor people lived with their cheap, simple and ungaudy cultural equipment. Excavations should be made at these sites and samples for 6-14 test should be collected. Another wave of the same Harappan or Indo-Caspian people came as a result of which some of the orthodox and irreconcillient eariler inhabi- tants moved forward or were pushed forward. These poor refugees produced the OCP which has some times been found along with the Harappan pottery that they might have brought with them when they fled from the original homes. Another possibility is that after some time, these refugees who used the OCP, improved their relations with ~ the people who came in the subsequent waves and began living together at places like Bhadarabad, Bargaon, Manpur, Bhatpura, etc. Some of the previous refugee settlements too would have been affected by the, subsequent wave as a consequence of which we see the pre-Harappan</page><page sequence="3">208 Annals of the Bhandarlcar Oriental Research Institute Harappan, Cemetery-H and some local traditions joining together in their new settlements. Since the push was from the western and north- western quarters, the result was the eastern and south-eastern move- ment of the refugees who lived in poorer conditions with their jejune cultural equipment. The fact that not even a single site has yielded the OCP superimposed over the Harappan remains gives support to the hypothesis that the OCP culture was contemporaneous with the Harap- pan culture. The distribution of the OCP sites on the fringes of the nuclear Harappan zone or further east accounts for their desertion of the original homes and occupying new places out of the nuclear zone. The conditions in which they left their original homes and settled else- where explains the reasons of their poorer cultural equipment. Their relations with the Harappans and others are represented in the tradi- tions met with in their relics. Now about the association of the OCP with copper hoards. The two were associated together by Lai on the ground that the two sites he excavated to affiliate the known copper hoards from those places, both yielded the OCP. He, however, held this association only tentative. It was Dr. Sharma who, on the evidence of copper implements and some red pottery from Bahadarabad, pottery showing Harappan affinities from Manpur and Bhatpura and the existence of a broken anthropomor- phic figure in the Harappan levels at Lothal, held that the two, the OCP and the copper implements were definitely to be associated with each other. There are, however, certain points which go against this association as a result of which Dr. Sharma himself has revised his stand and does not associate the two. As indicated above, the Ochre ware people were the refugees contemporaneous with the late Harappans and included amongst them the pre-Harappan, Harappan Cemetery-H and some local elements. We know that none of these people used any copper implements similar to those of copper hoard implements. The two categories are different typologically and technologically. So if the parent-tribes did not know the copper hoard implements how could those who parted from them as refugees know of and manufacture those implements suddenly ? And why a sudden change from bronze to copper ? The Ochre-ware people were poor people as evidenced by their cultural remains. It is very unlikely that they had the facilities and even perhaps the technical skill to smelt copper and make such tools. As suggested by Gupta the hoards originated somewhere in Bihar or Chhota Nagpur from where they moved into the Gangetic Valley. It was here that they ^ evolved a few new types like the harpoons, swords and anthropomorphic figures which are not met with in the eastern region. Had they spread from west to east, there can be no reason to explain the absence of thçsç</page><page sequence="4">Miscellanea 209 types in the east. So the copper hoards cannot be associated with the OOP. Had the two been culturally associated together we could have got the OOP at almost all the sites which have yielded the copper hoards or reversely, copper implements from the sites yielding Ochre ware. But it is not so. Many sites have been excavated but no copper hoard has as yet been obtained in regular excavations from any Ochre ware site. The copper hoards belonged, as evinced by Lai to the aborig- inal tribes- the Proto- A.ustraloids inhabiting the region at that time and the OOP belonged to the Harappan refugees. At certain places they came in contact with each other and the result was the existence of the two at one place which led to their association. We thus see that the ochre ware people were the Harappan refugees, contemporaneous with them and were associated with the copper hoards chronologically and not culturally. References Deshpande, M.
