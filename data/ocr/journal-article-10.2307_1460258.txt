These Abstracts continue OTA (1958) and OTA (1960). The four objectives stated in the latter apply again: 1. To make known available biblio- graphical aids. 2. To supply information concerning important material to which access is not easy. 3. To help teachers become aware of technical research in OT studies. 4. To inform teachers of suitable resources for classroom use or student reading. Several characteristics are identifiable in the pub- lishing of 1960-61, and the Abstracts seek to re- flect these: 1. A number of individual technical studies by distinguished scholars have been col- lected and issued in single volumes. This has been a major publication trend in OT studies during the past several years. 2. The interpretation of Israel's early history is still in a state of flux. Lines of controversy are even more clearly drawn. 3. Many admirable books designed for "lay" reading have appeared. Since a number of these are by the best scholars, the way in which the material is organ- ized and the conclusions reached is often of inde- pendent significance for the teacher and scholar. Hence the inclusion of these studies here. Bibliography Of continuing sources for bibliography, the fol- lowing will supplement those listed in earlier Ab- stracts and are worthy of notice: The Bible and the Ancient Near East, ed. G. Ernest Wright. Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Com- pany, 1961. A collection of 13 distinguished articles in honor of W. F. Albright, primarily in the field of archae- ology. Two of these are noted below, and there is also a revised version of A's own "The Role of the Canaanites in the History of Civilization." The entry is made here in order to call attention to the bibliography of A's writings from 1911-May, 1958 (363-89). "Bibliographie Walther Eichrodt," ThLZ, LXXXV (1960), 629-634. Ernst Jenni has compiled this and prefaced it with an appraisal of E on the occasion of the sub- ject's seventieth birthday. Jenni, Ernst, "Zwei Jahrzehnte Forschung an den Biichern Josua bis K5nige," ThR, XXVII (1961), 1-32, 97-146. A characteristically thorough and balanced sum- mary of work in this field covering commentaries, texts and versions, the Deuteronomic history (per- haps the livest issue in this area), and the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. Stamm, Jakob Johann, "Dreissig Jahre Dekalog- forschung," ThR, XXVII (1961), 189-239. The first part of an extended survey of Decalogue studies during the past thirty years. Included are bibliographies; generalia, including the name, trans- mission, primitive form, additions, "Gattung und Sitz im Leben," source analysis, Ex. 34 and the other decalogues, and date; and special topics in- cluding the introduction and the individual com- mandments through the first. (The article is to be continued.) [* Professor Whiston's last contribution bore the dates 1958-1959; the latter date is employed again in the present instance, but in contradistinction to earlier usage the refer- ence is to publications that appeared too late in that year for inclusion in the previous Abstracts.-EDIrTO.]) 47</page><page sequence="2">48 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS Collections The following listing of collections continues those in OTA (1958) and OTA (1960) and in- cludes the more important recent volumes: Alt, Albrecht, Kleine Schriften zur Geschichte des Volkes Israel, Vol. III, Munich: C. H. Beck- 'sche, 1959. The first two volumes of this indispensable col- lection were noted in OTA (1955). Vol. III con- tains 26 articles on widely diverse subjects, in- cluding "Jerusalems Aufstieg" which discusses the factors making for the selection of Jerusalem as capital; "Der Stadtstaat Samaria" which discusses the selection of Samaria; and a further discussion showing how the old peasant economy was mod- ified under the monarchy (348-72). The majority of the remaining articles consider geographical prob- lems. Baumgartner, Walter, Zum Alten Testament und seiner Umwelt: Ausgewiihlte Aufsiitze, Leiden: Brill, 1959. Includes a bibliography of B's published works as well as 16 essays from various sources ranging in date from 1922-55, covering a variety of subjects such as the interpretation of the prophets in the nineteenth century, the Aramaic of Daniel, the res- urrection faith in the OT, Israel and Greek sagas, and the problem of the angel of the Lord. The ma- jority of the articles are supplied with Nachtriige, a series of footnotes bringing the material up to date. Congress Volume: Oxford 1959 (SVT, 7), Lei- den: Brill, 1960. A distinguished collection of papers among which may be mentioned Engnell's description and de- fense (13-30) of the tradition-historical method, which also includes the claim that "transmission in writing" runs alongside and complements the oral; Barr's description (31-38) of the anthropomorphic aspects of theophany, concluding that OT theology should operate not by special pleading but by a demonstration of the cohesion of OT thought; Hammershaimb's comments (75-101) that a unique quality of prophetic ethics is "the urge to account for" the ethics the prophets advocate, usually by an appeal to history; Maag's claim (129-53) that one major reason for the stress laid on the rule of God is the ancient Near Eastern fear that the cos- mic chaos might break in; and Noth's argument (262-82) that archaeology by no means insures the historicity of Israel's early traditions (against Bright) and that an etiological interpretation does not need in any way to be discarded on archaeologi- cal grounds. For the papers of Orlinsky and Bur- rows, see below. Hebrew Union College Annual, Cincinnati: He- brew Union College, 1961, Vol. XXXII. Dedicated to Julian Morganstern on his eightieth birthday, this is an important collection of studies. Among them should be noted: Blank, "Some Ob- servations concerning Biblical Prayer" (75-90), making some astute observations; May, "Individual Responsibility and Retribution" (107-120), discuss- ing the corporate aspects of "individual responsibil- ity"; Mowinckel, "The Name of the God of Moses" (121-35), arguing that Ex. 3 reveals not the name of the God, but the deeper meaning of the name of God and that "Yahweh" originates with the form ya-huwa, a festival exclamation, "Oh He!"; Muil- enburg, "The Linguistic and Rhetorical Usages of the Particle Ki in the Old Testament" (135-60), summarizing in a detailed and closely reasoned way the usages of ki in emphatic word contexts, explor- ing the areas where it introduces motivations of various kinds, and particularly indicating how it comes to influence the style and composition of various literary types and forms; Eissfeldt, "Sinai- Erzahlung und Bileam-Spriiche" (179-90), examin- ing the similarity of historical faith and religious significance of Ex. 19-34 and Num. 22-24; and Coppens, "Les Psaumes 6 et 41 dependent-ils du Livre de J&amp;ermie?" (217-26), answering that two formulas of prayer are involved, probably older than Jeremiah. The non-Hebrew section concludes with No. 4 of Morganstern's Amos Studies, "The Address of Amos: Text and Commentary." At the end is a full index of Vols. I-XXXI. Hempel, Johannes, Apoxysmata: Vorarbeiten zu einer Religionsgerschichte und Theologie des Alten Testaments (Beihefte zur ZAW, 81). A collection of 10 major articles by H which have appeared in various journals from 1924-52 covering such subjects as the idea of God in the prophets; curse and blessing in Israel; Job; God, man and beast in the OT*; and prophet and poet. Kuschke, Arnulf, Verbannung und Heimkehr: Beitriige zur Geschichte und Theologie Israels im 6. und 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr., Tiibingen: Mohr, 1961. This well-deserved and distinguished Festschrift for Wilhelm Rudolph includes, among others, es- says by Baumgaertel on the use of God's name in Jeremiah and Ezekiel; Eissfeldt on Jeremiah's ora-</page><page sequence="3">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 49 cles against Egypt and Babylon; Galling on Zerub- babel and the Return; Hertzberg on Isa. 53; Hesse on Haggai; Jepson on the covenant theology of the Exile; Mowinckel on "'Ich' und 'Er' " in Ezra; and a bibliography of Rudolph's works. (ThLZ, LXXXVI [Aug., 1961] contains a sketch of Ru- dolph's career on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.) Theologische Biicherei, Miinich: Chr. Kaiser Verlag. The publishers have included a number of out- standing collections in this fine series. To those noted in OTA (1960) should be added the further studies in Gesaimmelten Studien zumn Alten Testa- ment of Martin Noth, 2nd ed. (1960) and the im- portant Probleme alttestaimentlicher Hermenewtik: Aufsdtze zum Verstehen des Alten Testaments, Vol. 11 (1960), including contributions by von Rad, Westermann, Bultmann, Noth, Zimmerli, Eichrodt, and others. Ten studies by Friedrich Horst, Gottes Recht, Vol. 12 (1961), have been collected; they concern themselves with the theology and poetry of the OT. Introduction Auvray, Paul, Pierre Poulain, and Albert Blaise, The Sacred Languages, London: Burns and Oates, 1960 (American Publisher: Hawthorn Books). Under Roman Catholic auspices, 150 brief vol- umes by experts are being published under the gen- eral title of "Faith and Fact Books" designed to cover "the whole area of modern knowledge in the light of Catholic teaching." Vols. 60-72 concern the Bible (e.g., cf. OTA 1960, p. 349, Steinmann). Most are by French scholars and are conspicuous for their clarity of style. This brief sketch of 173 pp. covers all that the average layman needs to know about Hebrew and Aramaic, Greek and Latin; including not only linguistic data, but the ways in which the nature of the language influences the manner of expression. Bright, John, "Modern Study of Old Testament Literature," in The Bible and the Ancient Near East, 13-31, New York: Doubleday, 1961. Primarily a summary of Pentateuchal studies with a few comments on the prophets and the Psalms. "While the Documentary Hypothesis con- tinues to be held, it is clear that it can no longer be used as a support for the neatly evolving picture of Israel's faith .... None of the documents rep- resents a free composition, the contents of which can be dated at a fixed point in Israel's history." Despite the recent state of flux, the picture of the OT literature is now beginning to take on a rela- tively stable form. Commentary and Exegesis Beyerlin, Walter, Herkunft und Geschichte der iiltesten Sinaitraditionen, Tiibingen: Mohr, 1961. A source-criticism of the early traditions within Ex. 19:1-Num. 10: 10 which leads to the conclu- sion that there is not sufficient evidence to justify divorcing the Exodus-Conquest traditions from those of the Sinai covenant (in contrast with the credo theology described by von Rad and the analy- sis of Noth); further, that the Mosaic record is substantially reliable and that the theophany plays an important role from the very beginnings of Is- rael's faith. Fohrer, Georg, "Remarks on Modern Interpre- tation of the Prophets," JBL, LXXX (1961), 309- 319. A paper which reveals that form- and tradition- criticism do not go unchallenged abroad. Fohrer suggests that current interpretation "is still suffer- ing from an anti-Wellhausen reaction." New ele- ments do appear within the prophets. "A distinction must be made (1) between the form of the dis- course and its function, the "Sitz im Leben" and the "Sitz im Buch"; (2) between the tradition and its interpretation; and (3) between the general basic and the diverging theological currents in the Bible." Freedman, David N., "The Chronicler's Pur- pose," CBQ, XXIII (1961), 436-42. 1. Purpose: to establish legitimate claims of the house of David to pre-eminence. 2. Occasion: the return and rebuilding of the Temple. 3. The Chroni- cler was influenced by or collaborated with Haggai and Zechariah. 4. The Chronicler composed his work shortly after 515. 5. Later, Ezra-Nehemiah was loosely attached to his work. The Chronicler was a monarchist; Ezra, a scribe. Gerleman, Gillis, Ruth (Biblischer Kommentar, XVIII, 1), Neukirchen: Buchhandlung des Erzie- hungsvereins, 1960. The subject of Ruth is the Judaizing of the Moabite Ruth. The David motif was present from the beginning and came to be embarrassing. Hence, "Ruth" is a euphemism to render palatable the un- pleasant Moabite tradition. Also the story may be read as a tale of Providence which echoes motifs from Genesis. As the latter prepares for the Mosaic</page><page sequence="4">50 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS covenant, so the former prepares for the Davidic covenant. Gibson, John C. L., "Observations on Some Im- portant Ethnic Terms in the Pentateuch," JNES, XX (1961), 217-38. A description of the biblical and extra-biblical use of the terms Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Hurrians, Arameans, and Hebrews, concluding that 5 of these 6 were taken over by Israel following the Conquest, but that biblical usage differs to a smaller or larger degree from the external sources. In the light of these differences, this may make possible a Habiru-Hebrew equation and still permit some variance. Interpretation, XV (1961). The four numbers of this volume have been given over to four individual books of the OT, plus the inclusion in each number of an article on OT inter- pretation by a major German OT scholar. The Jan. issue is devoted to Deuteronomy. Von Rad, "An- cient Word and Living Word" (1-13), sets forth the major themes of Deuteronomy and their possi- ble implications for today. Jacob Myers, "The Req- uisites for Response" (14-31), summarizes the the- ology of Deuteronomy as that of one holy God, one holy people, one cult place, one prophet-that is, the covenant community and its several compo- nents. Edward Blair, "An Appeal to Remembrance" (39-47), stresses the Deuteronomy writer's intent to see the past in the present moment. The April issue is devoted to Job. Wilhelm Vischer, "God's Truth and Man's Lie" (131-46), sees the problem extending from Job to all mankind, whereby resolu- tion can be found only in a faith which trusts in God and God alone. Balmer Kelly, "Truth in Con- tradiction" (146-56), interprets the relationship of Job with his friends not as a conflict of right and wrong viewpoints, but as one of various combina- tions and levels of truth. Hosea is the subject of the July issue. Walther Eichrodt, "The Holy One in Your Midst" (259-73), finds the whole history of Israel reinterpreted when for the first time the love of God and the covenant take the center of the stage of faith so that an inner rediscovery of God is the result. H. W. Wolff, "Guilt and Salvation" (274-85), recognizes the daring thought about God revealed in Hosea's imagery which clearly reveals Israel's guilt and threatened judgment; less clearly, one sees beyond the judgment the promise of salva- tion. Dietrich Ritschl, "God's Conversion" (286- 304), contributes an exposition of Hos. 11. In the December issue, devoted to Daniel, H. H. Rowley writes on "The Meaning of Daniel for Today" (387-397), singling out the loyalty to God, God's judgment on evil powers, service to God, peace in evil times, faith and urgency. C. Umhau Wolf, "Daniel and the Lord's Prayer" (398-410), uses the Lord's Prayer as a point about which to synthesize the theology of Daniel. Arnold Rhodes, "The King- doms Of Men and The Kingdom of God" (411- 430), provides an exposition of Dan. 7:1-14. Three quite different commentaries on Isaiah appeared in 1960: Walther Eichrodt, Der Heilige in Israel. Jesjaja 1-12 iibersetzt und ausgelegt (Die Botschaft des Alten Testament, 17), Stuttgart: Calwer Verlag. Eichrodt discusses the vision of 6:1-13 under the headings of "God and Man" and "The Vision." Chaps. 1-5, 7-12 are handled as 5 major units followed by two excursi, one on the temple and temple priesthood and the other on the social preaching of the prophets. Georg Fohrer, Das Buch Jesjaja. 1. Kapitel 1-23 ausgelegt (Zii- richer Bibelkommentare), Ziirich: Zwingli Verlag. Fohrer provides a generous introduction to Isaiah and treats the passages with particular reference to their contemporary implication. Otto Kaiser, Der Prophet Jesiaja. Kapitel 1-22 iibersetzt und er- kliirt (Das Alte Testament Deutsch, 17), G8t- tingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht. This commen- tary is designed to replace the earlier commentary of Herntrich on the same chapters. In keeping with the developing trend of this series, K gives in- creased stress to critical matters, and this volume is considerably more detailed than the earliest vol- umes of the ATD. Noth, Martin, ed., Biblischer Kommentar Altes Testament, Neukirchen: Buchhandlung des Erzie- hungsvereins. The fascicles of this great commentary are gradu- ally growing in number. Vol. 13 (Zimmerli: Ezek.) has reached fasc. 7 (chap. 24); Vol. 14, pt. 1 (Wolff: Hos.) is complete; so also is Vol. 15 (Kraus: Pss.); two fascicles of Vol. 16 (Horst: Job) have appeared; Vol. 18 (Gerleman: Ruth) and 20 (Kraus: Lam.) are complete. The Torch Bible Commentaries, New York: Macmillan. This series of commentaries designed for laymen and stressing theological rather than critical issues is now nearing completion. Jeremiah by H. Cun- liffe-Jones (1960) is a straightforward treatment of the prophet that takes middle-of-the-road posi- tions. Hosea by G. A. F. Knight (1960) is a sug- gestive commentary continuing motifs of Knight found in his other books such as a stress on the anthropomorphic approaches to Israel's God and</page><page sequence="5">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 51 the interplay between Old and New Testament ideas. In 1961 there appeared Ecclesiastes and Proverbs by Edgar Jones. Still to be published are Genesis 12-50 (A. S. Herbert), Exodus (G. Hen- ton Davies), Joshua and Judges (J. R. Por- ter), First and Second Samuel (Wmi. McKane), First and Second Kings (R. B. Y. Scott), Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles (Peter Ackroyd), Isaiah 1-39 (J. Mauchline), and two volumes on the Mi- nor Prophets by J. H. Eaton and D. R. Jones. Wolff, Hans Walter, Dodekapropheten, Hosea (Biblischer Kommentar, XIV, 1), Neukirchen: Buchhandlung des Erziehungsvereins, 1958-61. W emphasizes the prophet's interest in history and finds his originality in his polemic against the Canaanite myth and cult in the light of Yahweh as the spouse of Israel. Beyond Hosea's own words, W sees a complex sequence of contributions by contemporary and subsequent prophetic circles. One of the most detailed and best commentaries on this prophet. Texts and Versions Beegle, Dewey M., God's Word into English, New York: Harpers, 1960. This is a slightly pedestrian but accurate hand- book describing the factors which make biblical re- visions necessary, as well as a clear treatment of the difficulties inherent in biblical translation. Bruce, F. F., The English Bible: A History of Translations, New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1961. Prepared to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the KJV as well as to coincide with the appearance of The New English Bible: The New Testament, this volume presents a reliable account of the Eng- lish Bible from its origins through the NEB and includes a generous sampling of translations along with eight plates. Burrows, Millar, "The Revised Standard Ver- sion," SVT, 7, 206-21. In light of the forthcoming revised reprint of the RSV in 1962, Burrows gives a mild apologia in describing the objectives and process by which RSV came into being. He identifies as "conserva- tive" the procedure and changes that were adopted. A total of 217 changes are being made. Only 63 involve changes in OT wording, and only one of these represents "an important difference of inter- pretation." Hence, "the new printing in 1962 will not be a revision or a new edition, but it will em- body a number of corrections and modifications. Orlinsky, H. M., "Kethib-Qere," SVT, 7, 184-92. Inasmuch as all other hypotheses are found to be unsatisfactory in accounting for the K-Q, the author argues that about 600 A.D. the Massoretes selected the three best Hebrew manuscripts avail- able to them. Q represents the majority reading and K, the minority. Paine, Gustavus S., The Learned Men, New York: Crowell, 1959. The "learned men" are the committee who were appointed to produce the King James Version. Despite some infelicities of style and manner, this book brings together much material of considerable interest and otherwise difficult to come upon. The focus is not so much on the composition and pro- duction of the King James Version as it is upon the personalities involved. Wellesz, Emily, The Vienna Genesis (The Faber Library of Illuminated Manuscripts), London: Fa- ber, 1960. This is one of a series of inexpensive volumes with reliable text and very fine color illustrations, which can be an excellent device by which students may visualize the transmission of biblical materials. (Also noteworthy in the same series is C. R. Dod- well: The Great Lambeth Bible.) History Adam to Daniel, ed. Gaalyahu Cornfeld, New York: Macmillan, 1961. A compact sketch of Israel's history is accom- panied by an introduction to its literature, enriched by hundreds of pictures illustrating biblical events, places, and customs; remarkably reliable through- out. Campbell, Edward F., Jr., "The Amarna Letters and the Amarna Period," BA, XXIII (1960), 2-22. C provides an appraisal and summary of the Amarna letters which describe conditions in Pal- estine 150 years before the Israelite conquest, in- cluding a discussion of the status of the 'Apiru SA.GAZ question and a number of allusions show- ing how the correspondence sheds light on a num- ber of biblical passages relating to the period. Expository Times. In the July, 1960 issue (292-96) G. E. Wright writes on "Modern Issues in Biblical Studies: His-</page><page sequence="6">52 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS tory and the Patriarchs" in which he contrasts the position of Alt, Noth and von Rad with that of Albright, Bright and Wright, claiming that the form-critical methods of the former gave rise to unjustifiable historical conclusions. In the April, 1961 issue (213-16) von Rad in "History and the Patriarchs" makes a detailed reply alleging that Wright had over-simplified complex issues. The discussion is most valuable, for its reveals a number of real differences between the two approaches, as well as some differences which appear to be appar- ent rather than real. Mendenhall, George, "Biblical History in Tran- sition," in The Bible and the Ancient Near East, Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Company, 32-49. Perhaps this contribution more than any other makes abundantly clear the inadequacies of the un- aided literary-critical approach to the OT and the necessity for other methods. Such change has been necessitated because of "(1) the breakdown of source analysis as the primary method of recon- structing Israelite history and religion; (2) the introduction of new methods and data; (3) the changes in the Zeitgeist both in the academic and the world scene." Hallo, William W., "From Qarqar to Carchem- ish: Assyria and Israel in the Light of New Dis- coveries," BA, XXIII (1960), 34-61. Using the work of E. R. Thiele as a basis for Israelite chronology, H gives a detailed "synthesis of neo-Assyrian history as reflected in its impact on Israel." Rowley, H. H., "Elijah on Mount Carmel," BJRL, XLIII (1960), 190-219. R gives a detailed examination of the Tyrian Baal cult and its threat to Yahwism, as well as the encounter on Carmel and its aftermath. He regards Elijah as one who saved Yahwism from extinction. The treatment is more editorializing and more ele- mentary than most of R's research articles, but cov- ers a broad area of subjects and brings to bear many points of view. Several popular hypotheses are punctured. Soggin, J. Alberto, "Ancient Biblical Traditions and Modern Archaeological Discoveries," BA, XXIII (1960), 95-100. S presents a brief but most clear description of differences between Noth (and Alt) and Bright (and Albright) in their positions on Israel's early history, a major point of controversy in current OT studies. The article is accompanied by full doc- umentation providing points of departure for fur- ther reading and the striking conclusion that the challenges each position has made toward the other have resulted in a modification of both positions and greater agreement than is often recognized. Van Zyl, A. H., The Moabites (Pretoria Oriental Series, 3), Leiden: Brill, 1960. A thorough analysis of biblical and extra-biblical sources, including a description of the topography of the area as well as a listing of sites, followed by 60 pages of history, to which is added a description of the language (largely based on the Mesha' in- scription) and religion. Religion and Theology Albright, William F., Samuel and the Beginnings of the Prophetic Movement (The Goldenson Lec- ture for 1961), Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 1961. In addition to a restatement of familiar A posi- tions (e.g., Mosaic monotheism, a chronology of the ancient poetry of Israel), the paper shows how ap- parent contradictions in the record of Samuel may be resolved in the light of new archaeological and Qumran materials. Samuel was a Nazirite, a char- ismatic prophet opposed to ritualism and to the kingship, but not to a nagid, the military leader of a confederation. Such an understanding of proph- ecy and Samuel clarifies many of the problems of Deut. 32, which contains a riv (controversy) pat- tern, presupposes a covenant pattern, and is ap- proximately contemporary with Samuel. De Fraine, J., Adam et Son Lignage. 8itudes sur la notion de "personnalite corporative" dans le Bi- ble, Tournai, Belgium: Desclee, 1959. The author begins with the concept of "corporate personality" derived from the work of H. Wheeler Robinson, which he regards as characterized by extension, fluidity, and persistence through time. He then analyzes the concept's occurrence in the OT texts and continues with concrete applications: as "Adam" (i.e., "mankind"), the king, prophets, serv- ant of the Lord, the son of man, and usage in the Psalms. He concludes with a description of the motif as it appears in the NT. The most thorough analysis of "corporate personality" yet to appear. Freedman, David N., "The Name of the God of Moses," JBL, LXXIX (1960), 151-56. The initial and common element in the word Yahweh describes the activity of a creator God, a</page><page sequence="7">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 53 concept common to the high religions of the ancient Near East and a term which goes back, as J af- firms, to the pre-Mosaic period. Distinctively Mo- saic are the qualities and attributes of the creator God of the Fathers revealed in the unique historical setting of the Exodus, Sinai, Covenant, and the prospect of the Conquest. (See Wilhelm Vischer, "Eher Jahwo also Jahwe," TZ, XVI [1960], 251-58, an argument that originally Yahweh was "Yahwo." In so doing, V provides much of the data which F's argument above assumes, e.g., Akkadian, Phoenician, etc.) Haney, Herbert M., The Wrath of God in the Former Prophets, New York: Vantage, 1960. A convenient summary of material which sees the wrath of God in relationship to his covenant with Israel. Therefore, "covenant wrath" is punitive, re- medial and condemnatory. The wrath of God arises out of his righteousness, love, and faithfulness. Interpretation, XIV (1960). Characteristically, this periodical devotes each is- sue to a definite topic. The January, 1960 number is devoted to anthropology, and includes Glenn E. Whitlock, "The Structure of Personality in He- brew Psychology" (3-13); Joseph Mihelic, "Dia- logue with God" (43-50); and Kenneth Thompson, Jr., "Out of the Whirlwind" (51-63), an analysis of the sense of alienation in the book of Job. The April number is concerned with eschatology, and includes David N. Freedman, "History and Escha- tology" (143-55), a study in the nature of biblical religion and prophetic faith. The October number centers about revelation, and includes Robert H. Bryant, "Problem and Relevance" (387-99), a dis- cussion of authority and the Bible; James L. Mays, "God Has Spoken" (413-20), a meditation on Gen. 12:1-4; and Allan R. McAllaster, "Hebrew Lan- guage and Israelite Faith" (421-32), which has ex- cellent sections on the sensuousness of the Hebrew vocabulary, verb usage, and the picture quality of biblical language. Interpretation, XV (1961). Each number of this volume contains an essay on OT hermeneutics by a leading German scholar: Martin Noth, "The 'Re-Presentation' of the Old Testament in Proclamation" (50-60); Gerhard von Rad, "Typological Interpretation of the Old Testa- ment" (174-92); Walther Zimmerli, "Promise and Fulfillment" (310-38); and H. Walter Wolff, "The Hermeneutics of the Old Testament" (439-72). All four of these essays appear in Probleme Alttesta- mentlicher Hermeneutik (Miinich: Chr. Kaiser Verlag, 1960), noted above under "Collections." Lys, Daniel, Nephesh, Histoire de l'Ame dans la Revelation d'Israel, au sein des Religions Proche- Orientales, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1959. L provides a thorough analysis of Hebrew nephesh (Fr., Ame; Eng., soul), beginning with a discussion of the philosophical and OT idea of the soul and concluding that Israel's thought cannot be separated from that of other Near Eastern cultures. A careful analysis of the actual use of nephesh in the OT reveals a development from the primitive idea of "being" to the exilic idea of potentiality in personality. This potentiality is the means by which man participates in the Holy. Ultimately, nephesh comes to mean not so much an individual in his po- tentiality, but a holy or sanctified person before his God. Martin-Achard, Robert, Israel et les Nations: La perspective missionaire de l'Ancien Testament, Paris: Delachaux et Neistle, 1959. Here is described the problem of the Jewish mis- sion in the OT and its relationship to universalism, followed by an extended analysis of II Isaiah, who understands that Israel's task is not to proselytize, but to witness by its continued existence and way of life. This is true of the OT as a whole as seen in Gen. 12:3, Ex. 19:6, Mal. 1:11, Isa. 19:21ff., Jonah 4:11, and Ps. 117:lf. Muilenburg, James, "The Biblical View of Time," HTR, LIV (1961), 225-52. In many ways this major article forms a counter- point to M's Way of Israel (Harpers, 1961), but here the material is more clearly and technically expressed. Beginning with a sensitive interpreta- tion of time in modern poetry, Muilenburg contrasts the world of space of Hellas with the world of time of Israel. Israel operates with a sense of history (hence, its meaningful metaphor of "the way") and time is described in terms of its eventfulness and concreteness. This provides the perspective for in- terpreting the Creation and for understanding Is- rael's emphasis on hearing rather than seeing, as well as its opposition to idolatry. The kerygma of Israel's deliverance is responsible for the didache of moral obedience and points to an eschatological fulfillment. Accordingly, the article closes with an analysis of 'olam, "world and eternity." Von Rad, Gerhard, Theologie des Alten Testa- ments. Band II. Die Theologie der prophetischen</page><page sequence="8">54 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS Uberlieferungen Israels, Miinich: Chr. Kaiser Ver- lag, 1960. Whereas Vol. 1 of this work (cf. OTA, 1960 p. 352) handled the theology of Israel's historical tra- ditions, vR is here concerned with the theology of Israel's prophetic traditions and again he stresses that the OT is to be understood (as it understands itself) as witness to God's action in history. Part I discusses pre-exilic prophecy, the nature of pro- phetic experience, and the prophetic view of the word of God, of time and of history; Part II, the canonical prophets and apocalyptic; and Part III, the relationship of OT and NT, claiming that just as the OT contains a series of actualizations in history, so too the NT is an actualization of the OT. An important critical appraisal by F. Baum- gaertel is to be found in ThLZ, LXXXVI (Nov. &amp; Dec., 1961), 802-16, 895-908. Robinson, H. Wheeler, The Religious Ideas of the Old Testament (2nd ed. rev. by L. H. Brock- ington), London: Duckworth, 1959. A re-issue of a classic OT work, in which the main text is almost completely untouched, footnotes are discreetly modified and brought up to date, with four pages of additional notes and up-dated bibliog- raphy at the end. Thomson, James G. S. S., The Old Testament View of Revelation, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1960. The purpose of this work is "to review the data of divine revelation provided in the OT." After claiming revelation as a fact and giving it defini- tion, T examines the media of revelation in the form of the acts of God, dreams and visions, the angel of the Lord, the glory of the Lord, and the face of God. Other media include the Spirit of God, the prophets, the law, and the names of God. The Word of the Lord receives fullest attention, with special stress placed upon Jeremiah. In conclusion, the God who is revealed is described as the living, ruling, and holy God of wrath, righteousness, and grace. Books Appropriate for Bible Study Groups or for Lay Reading In the period under review an unusually large number of books have appeared which do not speak primarily to the needs of the scholar, instructor, or the college classroom. Nevertheless, they are char- acterized by sound scholarship, excellent insights, timely applications, and fine rhetoric. They have great value for the layman or college student who wishes to read on his own or for the group which wishes to embark on Bible study. The following se- lections are representative. Dentan, Robert C., The Design of the Scriptures: A First Reader in Biblical Theology, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1961. Designed for the "layman," this study is divided into three sections each containing 26 chapters of four pages average length and each provided with a group of relevant Bible passages. Section I treats the problem of history; II, of doctrine; and III, of ethics, resulting in a lucid and reliable handling of the heilsgeschichtliche approach across these three perspectives. Barclay, William, and F. F. Bruce, eds., Bible Guides, New York: Abingdon, 1961-. A series of sketches falling halfway between commentary and introduction. Simpler than the Layman's Bible Commentary, these provide reliable introductions to Bible reading. Five of the OT vols. have now appeared: 4. Nation Making (Law- rence Toombs); 5. Historians of Israel (1) (Gor- don Robinson); 6. Historians of Israel (2) (Hugh Anderson); 7. Prophets of Israel (1) Isaiah (G. A. F. Knight); and 11. The Wisdom of Israel: Job and Proverbs (John Paterson). De Dietrich, Suzanne, Free Men: Meditations on the Bible Today, Philadelphia: Westminster, 1961. A study guide for the Bible as a whole organized about the motif of lost and recovered freedom: "moving toward freedom" (the OT), "the lib- erator," and "the liberty of the Christian." De Dietrich, Suzanne, God's Unfolding Purpose: A Guide to the Study of the Bible, Philadelphia: Westminster, 1960. A heilsgeschichtliche presentation of the Bible, a translation of a popular European study book for students. Superior to the popular Unfolding Drama of the Bible by reason of greater length, it yet avoids problems of technical scholarship in order to focus on theological issues and to serve for dis- cussion purposes. Frost, S. B., The Beginning of the Promise (Seraph Book), London: SPCK, 1960. These eight lectures for "laymen" are a skillful summary of the present understanding of the Book of Genesis. Three lectures concern themselves with the nature of the biblical God, the development of the literary analysis of Genesis, and current forms.</page><page sequence="9">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 55 The primeval history, the Abraham and Jacob sagas, the story of Joseph, and the blessing of Jacob each receives a chapter, while a final chapter considers the word of God as revealed in Genesis. Conspicuous are the clarity of exposition and the apt modern analogies, all serving to make a com- plex subject intelligible and modern criticism ac- ceptable to the "layman." Hebert, Gabriel, When Israel Came Out of Egypt, Richmond: John Knox Press, 1961. A rather effective approach to the OT in Chris- tian terms centered about the Exodus event: the Exodus in Israel's faith and in world history; the narratives of the Exodus; Moses, the covenant, and the law; and the Christian Exodus. The Layman's Bible Commentary, Richmond: John Knox Press, 1959--. During 1960-61 four titles appeared: The Book of Psalms (vol. 9, 1960) by Arnold Rhodes; The Book of Jeremiah, The Lamentations of Jeremiah (vol. 12, 1960) by Howard T. Kuist; The Book of Judges, The Book of Ruth, The First and Sec- ond Books of Samuel (vol. 6, 1961) by Eric Rust; and The Book of Ezekiel, The Book of Daniel (vol. 13, 1961) by Carl Howie. This series continues to authenticate itself as the clearest general commen- tary for the "lay" reader. Reviewed in JBR, XXIX (1961), 240-42; XXX (1962), 246-47. Murphy, Roland E., Seven Books of Wisdom, Milwaukee: Bruce, 1960. First of a series of "Impact Books" designed to bring to modern "lay" readers the best fruits of contemporary theological scholarship. The only comparable work is Paterson, The Book That Is Alive (N. Y.: Scribners, 1954). Here is much original thought and assimilation of the best schol- arly work coupled with clarity of presentation and format. Contains an exposition of the nature of He- brew thought; a description of the Proverbs; a form-critical approach to the Psalms; a discussion of Job, distinguishing between prose and poem; an interpretation of the dramatic nature of Canticles; an introduction to Koheleth; a discussion of Ec- clesiasticus; and a survey of Jewish Wisdom in a Greek world and Wisdom in the OT. Robertson, E. H., The Recovery of Confidence, New York: Association Press, 1961. A simple reliable description of the trend of biblical studies from 19th century literary criticism to the present scene. Robertson, E. H., Take and Read, Richmond: John Knox Press, 1961. Opens with a chronological sketch of how the Bible study group movement came into being from a European point of view and continues with pro- cedures to follow in forming and operating a Bible study group, along with examples of different forms of Bible study. For some, this book may not be sufficiently critical or theological, but it contains good, practical recommendations. Taylor, Charles L., Let the Psalms Speak, Green- wich: Seabury Press, 1961. T employs a topical approach to the Psalms, stressing their relevance for contemporary living through such themes as the psalmists' experience, their concept of truth, and the nature and solution of their troubles, and concluding with "poetry in an age of prose" and "coming alive." This latter describes some of the difficulties modern man has in accepting the religion of the psalmists, as well as how the Psalms may be used devotionally, litur- gically, and in preaching. Simply written, with sound scholarship as a foundation. Westminster Guides to the Bible, Philadelphia: Westminster, 1959-. Highly profitable for "layman" and student. Titles relevant to the OT include: The Bible and the Church: An Approach to Scripture (Samuel Terrien); You Shall Be My People: The Books of Covenant and Law (Edwin M. Good); The Story of Israel: From Joshua to Alexander the Great (Stephen Szikszai); Servants of the Word: The Prophets of Israel (James Smart); and The Way of the Righteous: Psalms and the Books of Wisdom (John W. Wevers). Wright, George Ernest, The Rule of God, Gar- den City: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1960. Reviewed in JBR, XXVIII (1960), 450-52.</page></plain_text>
