<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT RESEARCH EDITED BY FRANCIS A. RIDDELL NORTHEAST NEWFOUNDLAND. During August, 1968, Donald Mac- Leod (National Museum of Canada) continued a field program begun in 1966 in the Twillingate area of north- eastern Newfoundland. Three sites were excavated, all at Back Harbour, Twillingate. DjAq-1, a rich "Moorehead" red paint cemetery, has yielded an adequate lithic sample of both chipped and ground artifacts representing most of the types found in similar deposits in Maine, the Atlantic provinces, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Very little organic material was recovered (because of highly acidic soil conditions), but some charcoal was collected for radiocarbon dating. Four dates on samples reported last year averaged about 1500 B.C., clustering within a 400-year span. DjAq-4 and -5 are associated occupation and workshop sites on higher ground, 200 yd. and 1/ mi. distant from the cemetery, respectively. Their lithic assemblages seem to be of the same culture as DjAq-1, but they include a variety of working debris and produc- tion tools such as abraders and pecking stones which complement the cemetery sample. This season's pre- liminary excavation on these two sites will be followed up by intensive digging in 1969. The material from Twillingate manifests a close similarity to the lithic sample collected by Tuck at Port-aux-Choix on the west coast of Newfoundland, where favorable soil conditions have also preserved quantities of bone, antler, and ivory material. The Twillingate complex so far offers a greater variety of stone artifacts, so that these two locations augment each other's data. In addition, Back Harbour has Dorset and probably Beothuk components which, it is hoped, will fit into an overall sequence for the area. From Memorial University of Newfoundland, James A. Tuck reports the first radiocarbon date from the Maritime Archaic site of Port au Choix-3 as 2340 B.C. ? 110 (I- 3788) based on wood charcoal from one of the 52 "red paint" graves. Nearly 100 individuals are represented, and bone material was preserved along with a stone assemblage which includes adzes, celts, gouges, ground slates of all kinds, together with bone and antler points and harpoons, spears, lances, combs, hairpins, and other artifacts indicative of a people well adapted to life on the maritime. The economy indicates caribou, sea mam- mals, and hunting practices corresponding to some Eskimo groups as opposed to the Laurentian tradition in the mixed hardwood forest to the west and south. Al- though the indication presently is that Port au Choix-3 is roughly 1,000 years earlier than the site at Twillingate Island excavated by MacLeod (National Museum of Canada), the stone components are very similar at the two sites. NEW BRUNSWICK. Mary Jo Sanger directed a crew of three excavating the Eidlitz site, St. Andrews, for the second consecutive year. Corner-notched points and Middle Woodland ceramics were among the artifacts recovered from the shell midden site, dated to A.D. 660. The project was financed by the Province of New Brunswick. A second project supported by the Province was a survey of the north shore of the province carried out by Charles Martijn, assisted by Richard Wilson. The area is included in a large redevelopment scheme. Although few sites remain along the north shore from Shippegan Islands to the Restigouche River, the survey team located a concentration of sites in the Pokemouche River estu- ary. Sites here appear to range from Late Archaic to Middle Woodland. Supported by a contract with the National Museum, John Erskine conducted a detailed survey of the Passa- maquoddy Bay area. The purpose of the survey was to record all previously known sites, to locate new sites, and to gather sufficient data for an evaluation of the archaeo- logical potential of the region. David Sanger of the National Museum surveyed the upper and middle portions of the Tobique River, northern New Brunswick. Although many of the sites were badly disturbed by agricultural and logging operations, Archaic and Woodland materials were recovered. Sites located along the Tobique appear to be summer salmon fishing stations, while sites on lakes draining into the Tobique River are probably winter hunting camps. ONTARIO. A three-month archaeological program was conducted at Point Pelee National Park in southwestern Ontario during the summer of 1968. This project, con- tracted to Trent University at Peterborough, was sup- ported by a National Parks Grant in connection with the National Historic Sites Service in Ottawa. Field Director of the project was David Keenlyside (Department of Archaeology, University of Calgary). Members of the crew included assistant George Dearing, David Garrick, and Leslie King (Trent University), Michael Shaughnessy (Carleton University), and Martha Anders (University of Toronto). Initially, a survey of Point Pelee was carried out to determine the location and extent of existing historic or prehistoric sites. Of 15 sites located, 13 relate to the pre- historic period. The historic sites found are representa- tive of the initial period of European occupation during the first half of the 19th century. All of the prehistoric sites are located along old beach ridges, which at the time of habitation would have bordered Lake Erie. Many of the sites appear to repre- sent seasonally occupied hunting and fishing campsites. Little evidence was recovered to suggest extensive hor- ticultural activities. Lithic artifacts related to various butchering and hunting activities occur in large quanti- ties. Pottery is present in all sites, but it is generally not well represented. A great variety of vessel types and forms are nevertheless present. These range from castel- lated, globular varieties to noncastellated conical varieties. 199</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The ages of all the prehistoric sites have not, as yet, been ascertained. At present, estimates on much of the material would place it within the Late Woodland period, and perhaps some in the Late Middle Woodland period. The third and final season of a preliminary survey of the Trent Watershed was completed this summer under the supervision of the Department of Anthropology at Trent University. The objective of the greater program is to achieve a broad sample of the prehistoric resources within the vast territory included in the watershed. This year's survey was conducted under the field directorship of Fred Richardson (senior honors student, Trent Uni- versity). Thirty new sites were located and tested during the field season. A final report comprised of the results of the three years of activity is in preparation. PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND. Testing and preliminary exca- vations were carried out from June through October, 1968, at the Roma historic site, Brudenell Point, Prince Edward Island, by National Historic Sites Service of the National and Historic Parks Branch. The dig, involving 12 local university students, was initially under the direc- tion of Roderick Sprague, contract archaeologist from the University of Idaho. Frank Korvemaker served as field assistant and later took over for an extension of the field season in September and October. The site is reported to be the location of a trading venture in New France by John Pierre Roma started in 1732. The settlement was sacked and burned by New England raiders in 1845. Local tradition credited nine cellar depressions to the Roma occupation; however, excavation and historical research showed all but one to have been used by a Scotch general-store occupation about 1820-45. The recovery of three almost complete bottles and fragments of another four (all dating from the 18th century), plus appropriate structural dimensions, would indicate that the remaining pit, though partially eroded by wave action, was probably the storage cellar described in the writings of Roma. On the basis of writ- ten descriptions (no maps from the Roma period have been located) of building relationships, several other buildings have been provisionally located. CONNECTICUT. From August 12 through August 30, 1968, New York University graduate student Lorraine E. Williams worked with the New York University field school, directed by Bert Salwen, at Fort Shantok, a 17th- century fortified Mohegan village near Norwich, opposite Fort Corchaug on Long Island. The fortification com- plex, consisting of three successively constructed pali- sades, was further delineated, and two pits were exca- vated to obtain samples for quantitative analysis. Miss Williams is now making a comparative study of the materials from these two sites, both of which have yielded large quantities of "Shantok" ceramics. The New York University class also continued to excavate the Shantok Cove site, just north of Fort Shan- tok. Most material was recovered from the sand stratum below the Woodland period shell midden. A wide variety of projectile point types (many found in apparent associa- tion), knives, scrapers, and a few steatite bowl sherds were recovered from this zone, which also yielded fire- pits, a small cooking pit, and piles of fire-reddened stones, presumably used in cooking. MAINE. During a period of two months, William A. Ritchie, assisted by graduate students Bruce J. Bourque (Harvard), John W. Graham (University of California at Los Angeles), and David R. Wilcox (State University of New York at Albany), explored three stratified shell midden sites on or near Deer Isle. The several com- ponents of each site pertained to developmental phases, ranging from early to late, of the Middle Woodland stage, resulting in a fairly adequate picture for this segment of Maine coast prehistory. Charcoal samples for the various levels will be radiocarbon dated. Temple University has begun a campaign, under the direction of Jacob W. Gruber, to complete archaeo- logical investigations to determine the character of the settlement of DuMont and Champlain established on an island in the St. Croix River in 1604. Magnetometer and resistivity surveys have been made under the direction of Elizabeth Ralph of the Applied Science Laboratory for Archaeology of the University Museum, Philadelphia, and excavation will begin in the early summer of 1969 for a 10-week campaign contracted for by the National Park Service which is preparing St. Croix National Monument for interpretation. St. Croix is the locale of the first recorded effort in North America which can properly be termed historical archaeology, namely the planned search by the British Boundary Commission in 1797 to determine the identity of the 17th-century French settle- ment attempt. Excavation revealed stone foundations of structures which were further identified by means of diagnostic artifacts which were recorded by the Com- mission as evidence of the location of the structures and of their identity. On this evidence the Maine-Canada boundary was established at the St. Croix River. Present work is based upon the preliminary survey of Wendell Hadlock and J. C. Harrington in the early 1950's. NEW HAMPSHIRE. Howard R. Sargent reports that a highway salvage excavation by Franklin Pierce College and a closely correlated undertaking by the New Hamp- shire Archeological Society resulted in a major investiga- tion of the Smyth site at Amoskeag Falls, Manchester. The completed salvage excavation covered an area 170 ft. long and up to 50 ft. wide. Seven burials were recovered, thus providing the most extensive series of skeletons yet available from a New Hampshire site. While cultural associations were negligible, consisting only of well- defined bone points resting in the chest cavities of two adult males, valuable data on physical type, disease, etc., are now becoming available. At this time all burials from the site appear to belong within Late Woodland time. A collection of potsherds estimated at between 8,000 and 10,000 will permit the establishment of valid pottery types for central and southeastern New Hampshire. Be- cause of the small sherd counts usually encountered on New Hampshire sites, statistical analyses have been meaningless until now. To a lesser degree, lithic traits will also be more adequately typed. 200 [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH Because the Amoskeag Falls constituted the first major obstacle which fish encountered on the spring run up the Merrimack River, the area was of prime importance as a fishing station to people from widely separated regions and over a long temporal span. The deposits reflect occupations from Late Archaic time until the period of European contact. Radiocarbon samples de- rived from early, middle, and late levels of the deposit have been submitted, but results are not yet available. That the area was visited by Paleo-Indian hunters is suggested by the recovery of portions of two fluted points from the archaeological society excavation. Unfortunately both points were found out of context (associated with later Indian deposits or in 19th-century disturbances), and no Paleo-Indian horizon has been defined. A small but very important excavation was conducted by Peter McLane and other members of the archaeo- logical society on the Neville site, which is situated on a lower terrace of the Merrimack River. While it must be regarded as a physical extension of the Smyth site, it is sufficiently far removed to require independent study. A radiocarbon date of 3435 B.C. ? 380 (GX-1320) was obtained by McLane from the base of the 7-ft. deposit and about 2 in. below a straight-stemmed, lanceolate point. The culture sequence extends from Archaic time into Late Woodland time. NEW JERSEY. Patricia Marchiando (New Jersey State Museum under contract with the National Park Service) continued excavations at the protohistoric Bell-Browning site, Sussex County. During two field seasons, 276 fea- tures were recorded, including storage, burial, refuse, and fire pits. Clear associations of European and native artifacts were found in these features which are repre- sentative of the Minisink Village complex. Data indicate a community study project is feasible. In conjunction with excavations at the Bell-Browning site, James R. Carr (historical site archaeologist, Univer- sity of Pennsylvania) gathered data and artifacts from nearby Fort Westbrook for the Museum. Available docu- ments indicate the structure was in existence by 1754, possibly as part of the defenses for the French and Indian War. Other evidence, including a date stone removed a number of years ago from the structure, suggests the fort was part of the early Dutch settlement in the 1630's. Analysis of the collected data will seek to provide a date and explain the uses of the fort through its occupancy. Following preliminary examination of the site by John L. Cotter (National Park Service), Robert Ditch- burn, assisted by Stanley W. Landis, excavated several fireplaces and established a definitive line for the huts of the New Jersey Encampment of Washington's Army on the present nature preserve of the New Jersey Audu- bon Society at Bernardsville, near Jockey Hollow. A total of 33 hutsites had been plotted onto a Geological Survey Map; these included two parallel lines of soldiers' huts, a row of line officers' huts (lieutenants and captains), and a single field officer's hut placed in the rear of those for line officers. Further investigations located latrines and refuse pits associated with the several lines of huts. The New Jersey Department of Conservation and Economic Development now has a full-time archaeo- logist for its Historic Sites Section; Charles I. Wilson, who holds this position, has conducted investigations at four state-owned sites during the past year. At Oxford Furnace (1741-1882), Warren County, sections of the bellows area and engine house were excavated. The work was conducted as part of a feasi- bility study which will determine the interpretation of the still-standing furnace. At Batsto Furnace (1766-1848), Burlington County, the charging area of the furnace was found below later 19th-century fill. The fill will be removed during the winter, and the area will be returned to the original working surface. It is estimated that at least 12 months' work is needed at the site of the furnace before it can be restored. At Martha Furnace (1793-1841), Burlington County, the furnace was excavated below a mound of rubble. Excavation uncovered the work arch, tuyere arch, and 15 ft. of the interior of the furnace. It was found that the furnace rested on a rack of cribbing consisting of at least three rows of pine logs. Surface water prevented further excavation. Work will continue at the site until cold weather and will be concentrated on the casting area. At Allaire Furnace, work was conducted at the site of a mid-19th-century vertical saw mill. The overall dimen- sion and several features of the brick structure have been found. The water wheel pit and an extension to the original building will be excavated this fall. NEW YORK. Field work in and out of New York State was conducted during the summer of 1968 by William A. Ritchie (New York State Museum and Science Service), with the aid of a National Science Foundation Grant. In- state work consisted of reconnaissance and site excavation in northeastern New York and on Staten Island, chiefly on Archaic sites. In July and August, Robert E. Funk (New York State Museum and Science Service) supervised excavations at two early historic Iroquois sites in the Mohawk Valley. In addition to the regular field crew of graduate students, comprising Richard M. Gramley (Harvard), Bruce E. Rippeteau (University of Arizona), and Ralph M. Houck (Pennsylvania State), he was assisted by 12 students enrolled in a summer field course at the State University of New York at Albany, in the charge of Peter S. Miller. At the Smith site in Fulton County, covering about six acres, a double stockade, which had protected the vulnerable side of the site, was traced. The village had consisted of five or more longhouses, only one floor pattern of which was fully exposed. It measured 230 ft. long and 20 ft. wide, was square-ended, had rows of storage pits along the interior walls and a central line of fireplaces. The artifacts, chiefly potsherds, and a few items of trade goods, indicated an age of aproximately A.D. 1580- 1600. 201</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY On the Cramer site in Montgomery County, the party excavated a small cemetery of 16 flexed burials, missed in prior amateur digging. Grave goods, found chiefly with infants and children, included small pottery vessels and such European trade goods as a brass kettle, a pewter spoon, and glass beads, indicative of the period of about A.D. 1620-1640 in the area. Continuing work begun at Sackets Harbor in 1967 by Edward McM. Larrabee, a second phase of excavations at the site of Fort Tompkins was completed in August by William Hershey. Excavations are related to a long-range restoration program sponsored by the New York State Trust for Historic Preservation and the Thousand Islands Park Commission which has implemented investigations in three areas occupied by U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel during the War of 1812. The overall plan of restoration involved the site of Smith's Canton- ment, occupied by more than 1,000 soldiers; a reconstruc- tion of Fort Kentucky, an earthwork accurately dubbed "The Mud Fort" by troops that were stationed there; and a restoration of Fort Tompkins, another earthwork fort located on Navy Point, which had barracks nearby for Navy and Marine personnel. Research is programmed by J. Duncan Campbell, military archaeologist and director of William Penn Memorial Museum, Harrisburg. During the summer of 1968, excavation was continued at the Smoking Point site, Staten Island, by a class from the Brooklyn Children's Museum led by John Vetter. This stratified site contains a range of materials from Archaic through historic cultures. An oyster shell midden up to 6 in. thick appears to contain Late Archaic or Transi- tional material. This is underlain by a sand stratum which has yielded flint and argillite specimens down to the water table, which is reached at about 3 ft. below the shell layer. Two related contact period sites, on opposite sides of Long Island Sound, were investigated during the summer of 1968. A field party, directed by Lorraine E. Williams (a New York University student) and sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, worked at Fort Corchaug, Long Island, opposite Fort Shantok in Connecticut. Two occu- pation areas were found within the 17th-century fortified Indian village, previously tested by Ralph Solecki. Trade goods and aboriginal artifacts, as well as a large collection of food refuse - shell and animal bone- were recovered from the occupation layer, which consisted of dark earth with a heavy admixture of shell, and from pits extending into the yellow sand beneath. The uppermost 12 in. of the sand stratum were devoid of cultural material. Below this depth, chipped stone artifacts and debitage were recovered. This material would seem to fit within the general category of the Archaic. Under the auspices of the Albany County Heldeberg Workshop, Inc., an educational and conservation agency, Paul R. Huey (University of Pennsylvania) has made extensive archaeological tests at a historical farm site (known as the La Grange Farm House) dating from 1680. The site is located in the Normanskill Valley of New Scotland Township, Albany County. At this site it has proved feasible to demonstrate evidence of accultura- tion and culture change within cultural systems, since the Dutch here would accept English artifacts and certain usages while remaining Dutch in their culture until recent time. Data are being readied for comparison with other sites of cultural trait exchange and resistance. PENNSYLVANIA. J. Fred Kinsey completed work at the multicomponent Fisher site which ranges in time through Woodland to Late Archaic and is located on the Pennsyl- vania side of Tocks Island Reservoir above the dam site. The work was conducted by a crew from North Museum of Franklin and Marshall College under a contract with the National Park Service. Results of the excavations will be published by the North Museum in 1969. Carnegie Museum field crews under the direction of Don W. Dragoo continued an extensive program of exca- vations and research in the upper Ohio Valley during the 1968 field season. Two programs supported by the National Park Service were conducted to secure addi- tional information on the Late Prehistoric period in the area. The first of these was centered in the Chartiers Valley in southwestern Pennsylvania. Here, excavations were concentrated on sites where there seemed to be a transition from late Middle Woodland Hopewellian cul- ture into the Late Prehistoric Monongahela culture. At site 36 Al 39 both rectangular and circular houses were typical of those known for pure Monongahela sites in the upper Ohio Valley. The Monongahela culture appears in the upper Ohio Valley as an intrusive Middle Mis- sissippian culture complex from the south, but the evi- dence gained through the 1968 field work indicates that the Mississippian influences were blended with resident Late Hopewellian traits. The second Carnegie Museum field program during 1968 was centered in the new Allegheny River Reservoir in northwestern Pennsylvania and southwestern New York. The main objective of this project was to gather more information on the Late Prehistoric period proto- Iroquoian settlements. Because of high water in the reservoir, work during the early part of the 1968 field season had to be done on the high terraces. No extensive proto4Iroquoian remains were found on these terraces, but a number of Archaic components and a significant Paleo-Indian complex with general Clovis traits were found. Late in August the water level in the reservoir was extensively lowered, exposing the old land surface for several miles in the upper reaches of the impound- ment. Five large and previously unrecorded proto-Iro- quoian sites were found eroding out of the river bank. Tests and surface collections at these sites indicated that the sites ranged in age from early to late in the proto- Iroquoian sequence established through Carnegie Muse- um's work in the area during the past five years. It can now be demonstrated that the upper Allegheny Valley was heavily occupied from Late Middle Woodland times until the Historic period by proto-Iroquoian groups with close cultural ties to similar groups living in Ontario and probably northeastern Ohio. Relationships with the Glen Mayer and Middleport phases of proto-Iroquoian develop- 202 [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH ment in Ontario seem most evident at this time. Further studies are needed to clarify this complex cultural sequence. During the 1968 field season, Don W. Dragoo (Car- negie Museum) also continued his studies of Early Man sites and collections in eastern North America. Addi- tional data on both conventional Paleo-Indian and pos- sible preprojectile point complexes were gathered and studied. The results of these recent studies are being prepared for publication. Vincent P. Foley (Moravian College) reports that the 1968 season marked the fifth year of coordinated historic site excavations and field schools at Bethlehem, concen- trating on the interior study of the 1761 tannery. The results of the excavations have, as often happens, raised new and complex interpretive questions regarding that 18th-century industry. The problems have been made more interesting by the result of a month's documentary research in the central Moravian Archives in East Ger- many. Despite generally advanced techniques found in all early Bethlehem industries, the tannery artifact inven- tory reveals a carry-over of tools which the Old World had discarded a century before. The archaeological and archival research was supple- mented in 1968 by the addition of a restoration architect to the staff. The architect began his duties by supervising a Historic American Buildings Survey team engaged in producing "as is" drawings of relevant extant structures. These drawings are designed as a starting point for detailed plans of the structures' original configurations. In addition to the normal accumulation of archaeo- logical data and interpretations, an attempt is being made to bring together a complete staff of specialists from various disciplines to work simultaneously, making inde- pendent and joint evaluations of the remains, for as complete an anthropological understanding as possible. Additional data are being accumulated from other part- time studies by an engineer, physicist, chemist, and the Geology Department of Lehigh University. All the disci- plines are working under the direction of, and are being coordinated by, the archaeologist. The premise is that results of this cooperative approach should prove as valuable to the understanding of this site as have similar approaches on prehistoric sites. Temple University, under contract to the National Park Service, fielded a crew in the summer of 1968 under the direction of Jacob W. Gruber at Allegheny Portage National Historic Site. The site commemorates the engineering feat of transporting canal boats by rail over the Allegheny Divide to link waterways of the Pennsylvania Canal (in the first half of the 19th cen- tury) between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The founda- tions and interior of a large stationary engine house which powered the cable apparatus was revealed at the head of Plane #6 which operated between 1831 and 1855. Other historic features were also tested, and a concentrated drive was made simultaneosly to produce new archival data to be checked by archaeological investigation. The historical research is being extended to England, and the objective is to produce hitherto unavailable evidence for precise interpretation of the operation of the Allegheny Portage Railroad. In the Philadelphia area archaeological investigation was completed at the site of the Bonnin and Morris factory in Southwark near the Delaware River where the first recorded porcelain manufacturing in America was carried out between 1770 and 1772. The site was located on the basis of historical research by Graham Hood (Detroit Institute of Arts), and excavations were directed by John L. Cotter with the help of students from a class in Historical Archaeology (University of Pennsylvania). The work was continued by Pennsylvania graduate stu- dents Paul R. Huey and Garry W. Stone with the finan- cial aid of descendants of the Morris family and the McNeil Foundation of Philadelphia. Evidence from the kiln area of the factory not only verified the location but established beyond doubt the authenticity of the exceed- ingly rare surviving examples of the Bonnin and Morris work which exist in several collections. Several houses in the Philadelphia area are being researched intensively by archaeological and archival investigations. Among these are the Morton-Mortonson House in Norwood where the Borough has secured a con- tractual agreement involving the expenditure of $50,000 of funds supplied by Housing and Urban Development. The project is in the charge of Mary Butler (University Museum) for archaeology and John Dickey, architect, for the architectural research. The house is related to the late 17th-century tradition of Swedish and Dutch archi- tecture. In Germantown the Colonial Dames have en- gaged Barbara Liggett, a doctoral candidate in American Civilization at the University of Pennsylvania, to conduct archaeological and historical investigation at Stenton, the home of James and William Logan, early 18th-century notables in the founding of Philadelphia. Miss Liggett has concluded archaeological and historical research at the Samuel Powell House on Third Street, Philadelphia, where investigations were made for the Philadelphia Landmark Society to establish the character of related structures and the garden area at the rear of the house. Miss Liggett has also finished archaeological and historical investigation at Hope Lodge, located at Fort Washington outside of Philadelphia. This State Park area is being researched, together with an associated grist mill and barn, as an example of an early attempt to establish a self-sufficient farm-industrial community according to William Penn's plan to complement the economy of Philadelphia. At Hopewell Village near Birdsboro the school house and two tenant houses of this late 18th- and 19th-century iron smelting and fabricating community were investi- gated archaeologically by Garry W. Stone under the terms of the contract between the Park Service and the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania. Barry C. Kent (Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission) reports completion of a season of field work at two sites in the Susquehanna Valley. Among the most significant results from the Strickler site in Lancaster County was the discovery of an enormous stockade sur- rounding the village. In nine weeks of field work at this 203</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY late Susquehannock site (1635-1675), 65,000 sq. ft. were cleared with a bulldozer and were mapped. Over 300 features were excavated, producing a mixture of native- made and European trade materials. To date, seven long- house patterns have emerged from the thousands of recorded postmolds on the site. The houses average about 70 by 20 ft. in size, and all are oriented in a north-south direction. Not all of the stockade was excavated this season, since certain portions are covered by modern buildings. Enough of the stockade has been exposed to determine that it has roughly parallel sides with rounded corers and measures almost 700 ft. across. A European-style bastion was discovered on the only corner which was completely excavated in the 1968 season. The project has two major objectives. One is salvage, since the site is threatened with eventual destruction. The other centers around a study of Susquehannock settlement patterns. Excavations at the site next season will be directed toward completing as much as possible of the stockade outline and determining the approximate number and organization of houses within the village. Archaeological excavations between June 24 and August 23 were undertaken at the Parker site, Luzeme County. This site, discovered and tested in 1967 by members of the Frances Dorrance Chapter of the Society for Pennsylvania Archaeology, is one of the few sites which has not been completely destroyed by coal removal activities in the Wyoming Valley. Before the Pennsyl- vania State Museum and Chapter members could begin the 1968 operations, it was necessary to remove from 2 to 5 ft. of sand and gravel overburden, the result of nearby strip mining. This overburden is probably what saved the site from becoming another Wyoming Valley casualty. Initial investigation places the date of the village at around A.D. 1450-1550. It is a large village surrounded by a five-post palisade and external ditch from which wall fill was secured. Directly inside the outer wall are the burned-out remains of a number of semisubterranean house structures. Farther to the interior of the site a maze of post-hole stains representing various surface structures are present, as well as the different fire, refuse, and storage features. Toward the latter part of the summer the Museum field team uncovered a portion of an earlier two-post stockade lying under the northern corner of the village. Since there is no major difference in the ceramics, the relationship between the two villages must await more detailed analysis of the collections. In general, the pottery indicates that these late prehistoric peoples of the Wyom- ing Valley had their nearest affinity with New York, and that they represent a self-developing enclave of northern peoples surrounded on all sides by indigenous popula- tions. One such population, the Susquehannocks, were migrating southward through the Valley around 1550. Their pottery is found intermingled in nearly every fea- ture. The materials are currently awaiting analysis at the William Penn Memorial Museum in Harrisburg. So far only about 20,000 sq. ft., less than one-quarter of the village, has been explored. Gustav A. Konitzky reports for Clarion State College that a major portion of the Ziegler site (36-Wa-80), which had been tested in 1967, was excavated by a crew of 60 students in July, 1968. In addition to a known Late Woodland occupation at the site, producing mostly grit-tempered wares, several pits contained Monongahela sherds in association with local ceramics. On the same Wisconsin terrace, but outside of the main Late Wood- land occupation, portions of a multicomponent seasonal campsite were discovered, which provided an almost complete projectile-point sequence ranging from Early Archaic to Middle Woodland. The site thus proved of major importance and is scheduled for further work in 1969. A site survey for Jefferson County was begun in the spring of 1968 to obtain information on site distribution in an area hitherto unworked by archaeologists. From data so far assembled, it would seem that the headwaters of the eastern tributaries to the Allegheny River, such as Redbank Creek and Clarion River, abound in Archaic level campsites. They usually are located on high ground adjacent to streams, while later Woodland occupation of the area seems to be sporadic by comparison. This seems to imply a shift of populations from the Allegheny Plateau into the major river valleys after the introduction of agriculture, although the uplands may have continued to serve as hunting grounds. Research activities in the archaeological laboratory included a continuation of pottery analysis from a num- ber of sites in the upper Allegheny drainage to arrive at a sequence chart. In addition, a study of Mononga- hela ceramic styles in the same area has been begun in order to determine whether local stylistic influences can be discerned. Konitzky continued the previously reported project of mapping and photographing the locations and remains of all known iron furnaces in the upper Allegheny drainage. VERMONT. In June, 1968, the Vermont Archaeological Society was incorporated. Vermont is the last north- eastern state to develop such an organization. The Society began with over 50 members at its first annual meeting at Waitsfield, October 18-19. The Society has acquired storage facilities for artifacts in Burlington. The archaeological survey of Vermont is being con- ducted by William A. Haviland (Department of Soci- ology and Anthropology, University of Vermont). The project has been funded through an institutional grant from the University and is being undertaken with the cooperation of the Vermont Archaeological Society. To date, over 60 sites have been recorded and assigned num- bers in a uniform system of designation which applies to the entire state. The cooperation of all those with knowl- edge of site locations within the state is solicited. It is particularly important to collate information on site locations at this time in view of the intensive construc- tion activity now taking place throughout the state of Vermont. JOHN L.

During the summer of 1968 the Cahokia site and its broad environs near East St. Louis continued to be the focus of the most intensive and sustained archaeo- logical investigations in the state. Charles J. Bareis (University of Illinois) conducted excavations at the Cahokia site and at the Knoebel site located 20 mi. east of the American Bottoms. He was assisted in this work by John G. Douglas and Ronald G. Wright of the same institution. At Cahokia, testing was resumed in a large refuse pit beneath Mound 51 situated approximately 500 ft. south- east of Monks Mound and at the Gem International Incorporated site on the former Powell Mound property one and one-half miles west of Monks Mound. Work in the pre-mound pit at Mound 51 exposed additional evidence of the stratigraphic sequence originally exca- vated by James W. Porter in 1965. A large quantity of well-preserved faunal and plant specimens was collected, and the pottery sample continued to reveal straight to slightly flaring rims with square, beveled, rounded, and extruded lips. A unique find of the investigations was the recovery of a portion of what appears to be a hooded water bottle from the deepest portion of the refuse pit. Excavations on the western margin of the Cahokia site were a continuation of the testing initiated during the spring of 1968 as a result of the construction of a store and parking lot by the Gem Company. An additional 13,000 to 14,000 sq. ft. of Mississippian village occupation were exposed with power equipment northeast of the old location of Powell Mound 1, or Mound 46. A series of wall-trench structures were located, with at least five built in a row with the long axes oriented east to west. To date, 100 archaeological features have been recorded from excavations at the Gem site. Excavations at the Knoebel site were conducted under the Illinois program of Highway Salvage archaeology. The Knoebel site is represented by a series of components, including both Late Woodland and Mississippian, situ- ated in a one-acre tract on the west bank of Silver Creek approximately 3/2 mi. southwest of Lebanon. The 1968 investigations excavated 17 Mississippian post and wall- trench structures (four partially completed) and a num- ber of pits presumably used for storage and food preparation. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee continued its research at the Cahokia site under the auspices of a grant from the National Science Foundation and under the direction of Melvin L. Fowler. This was the third season for UWM field parties working in the area and involved excavations in three localities. One of these was in the central portion of the site near what is known as Fox Mound and was for the purpose of increasing under- standing of the palisade lines discovered in previous seasons. Aerial photographs indicated that the palisade line uncovered east of Monks Mound continued south and then turned west crossing in front of the Fox Mound or to the soufh of the Fox Mound area. Excavations in this area were under the field supervision of Wayne Glanders, a graduate student at UWM. These excavations were very successful in that the palisade line was located and found to contain the same sequence of building and rebuilding as had been found in the earlier season's work to the north. The first stages of the palisade were built with round towers. These were followed by at least two later stages with square towers. A second project, under the supervision of Elizabeth Benchley, was carried out on the first terrace of Monks Mound. In the southwest corner of that terrace is a slight rise or elevation having the appearance, at the present time, of a dome-shaped or conical mound. This p3int was selected because of its relationship to the postulated north-south center line of the site and the post pit that was discovered in Mound 72, 700 m. south of Monks Mound. The small mound on the first terrace of Monks Mound seemed to be at an apex of a triangle that ties together several mounds and that is also on the north-south center line with Mound 72. Excavations here revealed the detailed complexity of this area of Monks Mound in that it seems to have been a focus for intense activity throughout the occupations or history of that area. The UWM excavations began where James Porter, digging for Washington University, had opened up an area, about 3 m. sq., down to a charcoal-bearing level. This excavation was expanded to the south, and another was begun on the east side of the small mound moving to the west. The plan was to cross-trench the area to determine the nature of this mound-like eminence. In the area of the Porter excavation a great deal of late material was found deposited, as if the area had been used as a refuse dump. A tremendous amount of animal bone and late pottery was found in these deposits. Near the center of the mound area, and underneath this refuse deposition, was a series of small mounds the surfaces of which were easily discernible in the profiles. There were at least two stages of this mound-building activity. Near the top-center of one mound was a recently disturbed, still partly intact burned clay floor. Underneath these mounds was a huge area of burned clay floor with evi- dence of structures having been built in that region. In the north-south trench at the south side of the first terrace another burned floor was discovered, this time with the collapsed walls of the structure preserved. The central area between these burned floors appears to have been an open clear floor; no evidence of activities in the central area was found. Samples from the burned clay floors (both the one under the mound and the one on top) were collected by Robert Dubois (University of Oklahoma) and will be tested for their usefulness in archaeomagnetic dating. Underneath the burned floors were found a series of level, prepared floors extending on down into the depths of the first terrace of Monks Mound. The total excavation depth cleaned out this summer was 15 ft. Due to the length of the season it was not possible to continue these excavations. This is a possibility for future archaeological investigations. The third UWM project was a continuation of excava- tions in Mound 72 south of Monks Mound. This is the 205</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY mound which in previous seasons had revealed the deep post pit and the status burial with retainers. Buried with this group of retainers were two caches containing 780 projectile points. Excavations were continued to the west in Mound 72 where evidence of another primary mound had been discovered the previous season. As the excavations proceeded, a rectangular subfloor pit was found in the central area of this primary mound. Upon cleaning out this pit it was found to measure about 15 by 18 ft. and to contain the skeletons of at least 53 individ- uals. Preliminary identification of these individuals sug- gests that they were primarily female between the ages of 18 and 23. The evidence thus suggests sacrificial burials. Near the burial pit a group of four individuals were found extended and with no heads or hands. These individuals were male. The data tend to confirm that of previous years suggesting elaborate retainer or sacrificial burials at the Cahokia site. No grave goods were found with the female burials in the pit. Concurrently with the excavations, surveying of: the site was continued in checking the locations of mounds that had been destroyed years ago, and attempts were made to better define the different areas within the site. In this process aerial photographs were collected from various sources. There are now over 100 aerial photo- graphs covering the area of the Cahokia site, and these date from the 1920's to the present. A University of Winnipeg field party, under the direc- tion of James Warren Porter, undertook a test excavation of the Divers site (Illinois Archeological Survey, Mo-28), 2.5 mi. south of the Lundsford-Pulcher site on the east side of Fish Lakes Channel. This area of the American Bottoms has interested those concerned with Cahokian archaeology even though little has been accomplished here. This preliminary excavation produced a series of five superimposed house units with associated pits. The earliest was of post-hole construction; the remainder were wall-trench type. There was a noticeable increase in width of the structures through time. Pits were of two types: rectangular (usually large) and circular (generally smaller). Pottery from the earlier levels was typically cord-marked and limestone tempered and included bowls and jars. Shell- and grog-tempered pottery appeared in the later structures. Polished hoe fragments were com- mon, as were small notched and unnotched projectile points. Two burned houses supplied ample material for radiocarbon dating. The Department of Anthropology, University of Win- nipeg, continues to support a lithic laboratory for the detailed microscopic analysis of archaeological data. J. W. Porter, with the assistance of a Canadian Research Coun- cil grant, has been able to accumulate samples of the various clays available to prehistoric potters of the Cahokia area. These have been made into test tiles, fired under controlled conditions, and thin sectioned. The test clays are then compared to thin sections of prehis- toric pottery from various sites in the American Bottoms. Preliminary results suggest a variety of clays (as well as tempers), but these are somewhat restricted to sites hav- ing close proximity to various clay sources. The wide variety of microscopic paste types found in a large center such as Cahokia points to the importation of vessels from a wide area. One of the objectives of the research has been to define this area, its changes through the time period A.D. 1000 ? 300, and to identify foreign materials. From June through September, 1968, Stuart Struever and Frank Rackerby (Northwestern University) excavated the Macoupin site, a Middle Woodland habitation site located in the lower Illinois River Valley. Macoupin was excavated to test an earlier hypothesis of a Havana sub- sistence-settlement system in the lower Illinois area. Macoupin, located on a fossil river beach in the flood plain of the Illinois Valley, was believed to be a "summer agricultural settlement" in the subsistence-settlement model. The 1968 excavations produced data that appear to refute this hypothesis. On visual examination of the artifacts, food remains, and features recovered, the site appears structurally similar to Apple Creek and other known Middle Woodland "base settlements" located on the talus slope of the valley margins. Eight hundred flo- tation samples were processed, yet the only definite evidence of agriculture recovered from the site was a single charred corncob recovered in definite Havana contexts. INDIANA. Ball State University conducted its third annual archaeological summer field school from June 12 to July 14, 1967, and its fourth field school from June 10 to July 12, 1968, under the supervision of B. K. Swartz, Jr. Field foreman for the 1967 season was Michael J. Rodeffer, for the 1968 season W. John Shrader. All sites excavated are located in Henry County, east-central Indiana. Excavation was continued on the New Castle and Commissary sites, dug in earlier field school seasons. The 1967 New Castle Mound Four excavations were directed by Schuyler Townsend, the 1968 excavations by Terry Curren. All but a small 5-ft. length of Mound Four-West (formerly referred to as the west lobe, but now known to be a separate mound later connected to the eastern mound by fill) has now been excavated. Two radiocarbon dates from samples recovered during 1965 excavations at the New Castle site give dates of A.D. 10 ? 160 (M-1852, unpublished) for Mound Four-West and A.D. 40 ? 140 (M-1851, unpublished) for Mound Four-East. The former date is from charcoal in direct association with New Castle Incised pottery, a new Adena type described by Buchman. Exploratory trenching in the Mound Four area was directed by W. John Shrader in 1967 and Thomas E. Habart in 1968. No occupation zone has yet been located. Habart encountered a historic feature believed, on the basis of artifact content, to have been a stable. Excavation at the Commissary site was directed by John M. Hartman during the 1967 season, and by Mary Louise Craig during the 1968 season. Numerous burials with few artifacts were recovered. Materials indicate the site is Late Woodland, but it is not yet dated. Ball State University excavation of the White site began with salvage operations in April, 1967. The site was completely excavated during the 1967 season under 206 [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH the direction of Randell L. Buchman, and during the 1968 season under the direction of Ronald L. Michael. The site is an Adena mound with log tombs and Adena Plain pottery. The artifact yield at the White site was particularly rich and included numerous copper objects. A date of A.D. 210 ? 140 (M-2016, unpublished) from log tomb charcoal has been obtained. Discovery of the Van Nuys site was made during a site survey in the 1967 season. Excavation at this site during the 1968 season was under the direction of Ben Morris. The site is a Late Woodland, valley-bottom occupation area. During the excavations extensive unpattered post holes were exposed. Data from the osteological materials recovered by the Ball State University field school are being placed on keysort cards by Jack M. Whitehead for future study and analysis. Rodeffer has done further work on the Delaware County survey, and surveys of Madison and Union coun- ties are being undertaken by Stephen Koleszar and Steven L. Hobson, respectively. Publication of Archaeo- logical Reports, No. 4, is imminent and provides the field reports for last season's activities. Elizabeth J. Glenn is making a comparative study of archaeological, osteo- logical, and historical materials from the Upper Mis- sissippi-Western Great Lakes area in order to determine interrelationships and to test methodological procedures. Indiana University, in cooperation with the Indiana Historical Society and the Tippecanoe County Historical Association, began the investigation of the possible site of Fort Ouiatenon, a French trading post established near the present city of Lafayette, Indiana, in the second decade of the 18th century. Historical documentation of the post is minimal and seemingly sometimes contra- dictory; hence its precise location is in question. How- ever, surface and aerial surveys have recently narrowed probabilities to a single area on a sandy ridge along the Wabash. Excavations were undertaken at the periphery of a well-defined midden deposit. In addition to a wide range of historical artifacts, both French and English, considerable contextual data were recovered as was a probable stockade trench. Though it is too early to assert positively that Ouiatenon has been located, evidence to date strongly indicates such identification. Work at the site is of consequence in that it provides an opportunity to investigate a relatively isolated early European settle- ment in the area and one which served as a focal point for a considerable number of Indian groups who lived adjacent to the post and at recognized villages across the Wabash. It is anticipated that the project will continue at least into 1969. Claude White, a graduate student in the department, in cooperation with the Indiana Department of National Resources, directed excavations at Mounds State Park in the east-central portion of the state near Anderson. The work was concentrated on a small mound near the center of the platform within the large "sacred circle." Black and Moorehead, in 1931, had put a small auger test into this low mound and had reported charcoal and ash about 12 in. beneath the surface. This summer's work con- firmed the earlier observation. The mound consisted of a small core mound, the surface of which had been burned and was covered, almost in its entirety, with a thin layer of ash. A partially disturbed flexed burial was encoun- tered resting on the top, and a secondary burial in a log tomb was recorded on the old group surface adjacent to and south of the core structure. A series of superimposed burned clay "floors" were found in a central portion of the primary mound. The whole had been covered with a mantle of earth to produce a mound about 45 ft. in diameter and 3 ft. high. Artifactual remains were few and consisted of some mica and bone awls regularly placed around the log tomb, probably to retain a tomb covering, and a platform pipe. Information recovered to date suggests relationship with materials recovered by B. K. Swartz at the Newcastle site, which is probably a regional variant within the Middle Woodland period. Jay Heilman, working for Earlham College, excavated the platform within another "sacred circle" in Wayne County, eastern Indiana, which Setzler called the Bertsch group. Plowing has considerably disturbed context within the area of excavation. However, Heilman has concluded there is some evidence for a structure towards the center of the platform, and he recovered cremated human remains from a pit in that area. Artifactual materials were significant by their absence. Kent Vickery continued salvage excavations at the Yankeetown site in Warrick County under National Park Service Contract. This is the type-site for the hitherto ill-defined Yankeetown complex and has produced evi- dence in the past for hearths and burned areas in a caving Ohio River bank to a depth of 14 ft. Excavations in 1965 and last year succeeded in providing some clear definition of Yankeetown. The University of Michigan provided a date of A.D. 900 ? 130 (M-2007) for the com- plex. A seeming Crab Orchard level date at 300 B.c. ?- 140 (M-2008) by the University of Michigan was encoun- tered at the 7-ft. level. A radiocarbon date of 790 B.c. ? 150 (M-2009) was determined for a burned area at 11 ft. Work during the 1968 season emphasized the deeper deposits and progressed to a maximum of 21 ft., where burned materials were encountered. Auger borings were made to 28 ft. with good evidence of human activity to nearly that depth. While well-defined hearths containing burned nuts are extremely common, cultural definition was impossible because of the absence of definitive artifactual debris. Except for the 152 heavy clay-tem- pered, cord-marked sherds from the 6- to 7-ft. level, only a few flint scraps were found below. MICHIGAN. The Great Lakes Division of the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology has been involved during the past four years with an intensive investigation of the relationship of prehistoric cultural development and environmental variation in the state of Michigan. This imposing project, a direct outgrowth of interest stimulated by earlier programs in the area, started in 1964 when James E. Fitting was appointed Curator of Great Lakes Archaeology at the Museum of Anthropology. Most of this research was supported by the National 207</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Science Foundation under grant numbers GS-666: "Ar- chaeological Investigations of the Carolinian-Canadian Edge Area in Central Michigan," and GS-1486: "Archaeo- logical Investigation in Michigan," with Fitting the prin- cipal investigator. Earlier grants made to James B. Griffin helped to support initial phases of the program. Other sources of support were the Mackinac Island Park Com- mission, the National Park Service, The University of Michigan Faculty Research Fund, and the National Sci- ence Foundation Undergraduate Research Participation program. In addition to site surveys and site excavations, a number of sites excavated in the past by both amateur and professional archaeologists were submitted to restudy. The results of this work constitute a major contribution to the prehistory of the Great Lakes region and have been appearing, under the authorship of a number of individ- uals, in articles in The Michigan Archaeologist and in monograph form in the Anthropological Papers series of the Museum of Anthropology. Two M.A. theses and two doctoral dissertations have also been based on this research. During the 1968 field season, Michigan State Univer- sity was engaged in three archaeological projects. The field school at Fort Michilimackinac at Mackinaw City, was under the direction of James Brown and was financially supported by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission. The program of excavation was limited to completing undug areas in the southwest and northwest corners of the existing stockade reconstruction and to test areas next to stockade exterior. Eight students and three supervisors helped uncover a wealth of construction elements of a British-period row house. Clear stratigraphy could be worked out in the southwest corner where wind- blown sands had built up the ground level. The earliest occupation was a Mackinaw phase prehistoric component. The second was a French component laid down when the area was outside the stockade, and the third was a stratigraphically complex layer with late French and British occupation that includes the row house complex. The latter occupation was closed at the time of aban- donment (1781) and was protected by a thick layer of wind-blown sand. The western limits of the third and fourth stockade additions could be identified in the southwest corner. Large basements and a substantial fireplace with a stratified series of hearths was excavated for the end unit of the row house complex. It was determined that the row house stood within 4 to 5 ft. of the stockade. An excavation at the Fletcher site, Bay City, was under the direction of Moreau S. Maxwell and was funded by the Michigan State University Department of Anthro- pology and the University Alumni Association. A team of six Michigan State University students under the direction of Maxwell continued excavations for a second season. The site, first called to attention by activities of a dredging crew on the Saginaw River, was an 18th- century Indian burial ground. To date, 91 burials have been excavated, most containing an unusual wealth of trade goods which appear to date from 1740 to 1790. In addition to the usual assemblage of knives, axes, strike- a-lights, brass kettles, beaded articles of clothing, and brass and German silver ornaments, the excavations have produced such exotic trade items as complete muskets, a complete pistol, French perfume bottles, and a complete French greatcoat covered with "gold" braid. Preliminary analysis of the grave goods suggests significant cultural differences in the treatment of age groups, and status differentiations related to social structure. The burial pits cut through two feet of midden laid down periodically from Early Woodland times through Middle Woodland into an extensive early Late Woodland component. Pot- tery styles indicate transitional features from Middle to Late Woodland and the merging of influences from northeast and southeast. An archaeological survey of the upper Grand River Valley and excavation on North Manitou Island were under the direction of Charles E. Cleland, with finances by the U.S. National Park Service, The MSU Museum, and the Angell Foundation. Fourteen students under Cleland's supervision con- ducted a survey of the Grand Valley between Eaton Rapids and Jackson. The five-week survey produced 48 new sites and indication of more intensive prehistoric occupation of the valley than previously supposed. Paleo- Indian, Early and Middle Archaic, and numerous Late Woodland sites were located; some were selected for future excavation. The same crew then moved to North Manitou Island in Lake Michigan to continue an archaeo- logical program begun as a survey the previous season. Three weeks of excavation were begun on the NM-3 site which proved to be a chipping station occupied by both Archaic and Late Woodland occupations. Cleland's field season was concluded with a two-week survey of parts of the Traverse Corridor in Charlevoix County where three additional large village sites were located. MINNESOTA. University of Minnesota research on the problem of the impact of wild rice utilization on the economy and settlement pattern of the late prehistoric cultures of the upper Mississippi Valley continues under the direction of Elden Johnson. Excavation of both wild rice harvesting and permanent village sites in the vicinity of Lake Mille Lacs indicates an extensive use of wild rice after A.D. 1000 correlated with the establishment of permanent villages. John McAndrews (Royal Ontario Museum) continues to cooperate with the project in pollen and plant macrofossil analysis of wild rice lake cores. Financing from the state legislature through the Minnesota Natural Resources Commission supports the project. James B. Stoltman (University of Wisconsin) is com- pleting a manuscript on the Laurel data from Minnesota, though a brief field excavation at the Laurel site to obtain a clear sample of organic material for radiocarbon dating was unsuccessful. Establishment of a highway salvage survey in Minne- sota was finally accomplished through an agreement between the Highway Department and the Minnesota 208 [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH Historical Society. Charles Watrall began the survey work during the past summer. MISSOURI. The past summer was the final season of field work on a project investigating the paleoecology of the western Ozark Highlands, supported by the National Science Foundation, and directed by W. Raymond Wood (University of Missouri). Work at Rodgers Shelter by R. Bruce McMillan was primarily in the lower deposits, in zones 20 to 30 ft. deep which should predate 6000 B.c., since six radiocarbon dates in hearths about 15 ft. deep are this old. Below a depth of 15 ft. there is a marked change in the occupational patterns at the site. In con- trast to the intensively occupied zones in the upper half of the site, the lower levels reveal a long period of inter- mittent occupation; there are only rare hearths and con- centrations of camp debris this deep. The major occupa- tion there is represented by Dalton points, flake end scrapers, spokeshave scrapers, triangular bifaces, simple and bifurcated gravers, and mullers. In addition, there are three Plano-type specimens, one with distinctive fluting, and similar in outline to Plainview points. Work at the nearby Boney Spring and Trolinger Spring as part of the same project yielded abundant remains of megafauna (mastodon, muskox, giant beaver, sloth) and remains of smaller mammals in deposits containing abun- dant pollen and plant macrofossils. Major climatic shifts as yet undated are revealed in the pollen work being done by P. J. Mehringer. Geological and paleontological stud- ies are in progress by C. Vance Haynes and Everett Lindsay. Salvage archeological work was conducted in three reservoir areas under the direction of W. Raymond Wood, under cooperative agreements with the National Park Service. Salvage work was continued in the Smithville Reservoir with a crew directed by F. A. Calabrese. Nine weeks were spent at the Friend and Foe site, 23CL113, and the Butcher site, 23CL118. Work at the former site revealed two small ill-defined subrectangular houses and associated features. Two pits and part of a probable house were noted at the Butcher site. Artifacts include pottery vessels, trowels, and pipes; projectile points and other chipped stone tools; ground stone celts, abraders, and hematite. A variety of seeds, including maize, were recovered by flotation. The pottery resembles that from the Steed-Kisker site but lacks the decorative motifs from that site; it also resembles pottery from sites in the south- ern part of the Nebraska aspect. Investigations were also conducted for the second year in the Cannon Reservoir under the supervision of Walter Klippel and Margaret Mandeville. Excavations were con- ducted at a late Archaic campsite and an Early to Middle Woodland village site, with limited tests in a Late Wood- land site. Preliminary analysis of the material from the Late Archaic site suggests it closely compares with that from similar sites investigated the previous year. Analysis will permit the description of a heretofore undefined com- plex or phase. Refined recovery techniques will provide new data on the economy of Woodland groups, sites of which are so common in this part of northeastern Missouri. A third reservoir salvage party continued work in the Kaysinger Bluff reservoir in western Missouri. Kerry Lippincott directed the second season of investigations at the Thurman site, a multicomponent village on the South Grand River; areas around an Archaic hearth 3.5 ft. were explored. Exploratory tests were made in two other sites. One of them, at least 9 ft. deep, yielded a Milnesand-like point on the surface. A second party in the reservoir, directed by Rolland E. Pangborn, dug a burial cairn on a ridge overlooking the Thurman site. The 30-ft. cairn, representing the Fristoe Burial complex, contained Scallorn and Rice Side-notched points, two cremations, and five bundle burials -one of which exhibited a filed human incisor. The National Park Service also helped sponsor salvage work, directed by Dale R. Henning, in areas being land- leveled in the Mississippi alluvial valley in southeastern Missouri. Ray Williams tested four sites: Beckwith's Fort (23Mi2), an Early Mississippian fortified village; Harryette (23NM269), a small Middle Baytown village; Potato Patch (23NM217), an Early Baytown site; and Denton Mound (23PM549), a Late Mississippian village. Excavations will continue in the spring of 1969. Excavations continued at Towosahgy State Park, under a cooperative agreement with the University of Missouri and the Missouri State Park Board; this work was directed by Carl H. Chapman. Under the direction of Gerald Smith, an effort to locate the wall and ditch around the village was successful. One mound was trenched to determine its construction, and several tests were made in the village area. As the analytical stage of the Catlinite Age and Dis- tribution Project proceeds, the chief investigator, John S. Sigstad, becomes more fully indoctrinated in the ways of analytical radiochemistry. Some 54 quarry samples, col- lected in situ, are the present focus of attention in the laboratory. An identification index for red "pipe-stones" is the immediate goal, projecting subsequent analysis of some 1,500 artifactual samples for source identification. The Archaeological Survey of Missouri now has a full- time Director, David R. Evans, who is evaluating the archaeological resources in the Meramec Basin, part of the Meramec National Recreational Area. The University of Missouri continued research on the Utz Oneota site near Marshall, where the Hamilton Archaeological Field School was based for the 10th con- secutive year. A previously rare Oneota trait - the very small refuse pit -became more familiar with the occur- rence of 12 such features, not exceeding in any instance a depth of 18 in. This contrasts with the usual 5 to 6 ft. A new type of large, deep blue, glass trade bead was found with one of seven primary burials. The burials, all disturbed by cultivation, were associated with five fire hearths and at least one partial house pattern. Postmolds were 2 to 3 in. in diameter and apparently indicate a rela- tively long structure, presumably of light pole and reed construction. 209</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Students of the Hamilton Field School provided the man-power for excavations at three other localities: the Fisher-Gabert Hopewell site in Saline County, under the immediate supervision of Clarence Geier; the Semirg (Sedalia Culture) site in Pettis County, supervised by Kerry McGrath; and the First Missouri State Capitol site at St. Charles, supervised by Robert T. Bray and Robert D. Hyatt. Continuation of excavations at First Capitol later in the summer was supervised by Clarence Geier. At Fisher-Gabert considerable quantities of pottery, stone tools, and an anthropomorphic, pottery figurine were found. Partially uncovered was a probable house floor. At the Semirg Archaic site, a stone "floor" consisting of various cherts, cores, fragments, chopping and scraping tools, and four lanceolate Sedalia points were excavated from 8 to 12 in. beneath the surface of a high terrace. At Missouri First State Capitol (1821-1826) at St. Charles, original foundations of outbuildings, two wells, and many artifacts were found. A 104-page preliminary report on previous (1967) work was published in March, 1968. Analysis of the 1968 finds is progressing. Three original buildings of the First Capitol complex are now in the final stages of restoration by the Missouri State Park board. In October, a preliminary archaeological survey was conducted on the grounds of the Hanley (historic) House in Clayton, greater St. Louis, Missouri, in cooperation with the city of Clayton. The project is part of the initial research phases of a proposed restoration. Few artifacts were recovered, but there were established the locations of two, possibly three, original outbuildings, original fence lines, two cisterns, and a privy. Excavations are scheduled for 1969. Work of the field school, and the additional projects outlined, were under the direction of Robert T. Bray. OHIO. The Department of Archaeology of the Ohio State Museum has, during the past year, been involved with field work, organization and installation of exhibits, and museum training programs. Field work continued at Mound City Group National Monument, Chillicothe, with the excavation of Mounds 17 and 23, and the dis- covery of the post holes of a charnel house beneath each one. The ovoid pattern beneath Mound 17 was similar in outline to one found beneath Mound 9 of the Havana site in Illinois. The pattern beneath Mound 23 was rhomboid in shape like the one associated with Mound 5 at Mound City. Both charnel houses found this year were oriented toward the central mound complex. The principal field work undertaken this year was the excavation of an Adena mound in the Alum Creek Reservoir area northeast of Columbus. Uncovered were a circular house pattern, three empty pits, and numerous late Adena artifacts. Surprisingly, there were no burials despite the fact that two of the pits were of a type that usually contain extended inhumations. Possibly the chemical composition of the soil was not conducive to bone preservation. Samples were taken and will be analyzed in a soils laboratory this winter. Test excava- tions in a field adjoining the mound site produced some midden and a few post holes. Exhibits were completed for new site museums at Fort Ancient, Fort Hill, and Flint Ridge. Plans for dis- plays at the new Ohio History Center are being drawn up, and construction is expected to begin this winter. The Center, to be completed in 1970, will replace the Ohio State Museum. The department is continuing its cooperation with the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities by participating in the museum internship program. Mar- garet Satterfield is now being trained in various aspects of museum work - cataloging, preservation, display tech- niques, etc. - under this program. WISCONSIN. Under the direction of G. Richard Peske, The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee conducted an 8-week summer archaeological field school on Washing- ton Island. This island is just north of the Door Peninsula in Green Bay-Lake Michigan. Most of the excavations were at the Richter site of the North Bay complex of the Middle Woodland tradition. The major features adding to our knowledge of the North Bay complex are: (1) group burial of four individuals; (2) a dog burial with a North Bay Scallop vessel; and (3) a large oval house. Preliminary analysis indicates that the strongest pre- historic occupation of the island was by Middle Wood- land peoples who exploited the land mammals as well as the lake resources. Included in local collections is an interesting cache of stemmed North Bay projectile points, ovoid blades, brachiopods, and red ocher. With support from The National Science Foundation, Ronald J. Mason (Lawrence University) has been work- ing up material from excavated and surface survey sites in northeastern and north-central Wisconsin. A signi- ficant part of this research has involved studies of unpub- lished or inadequately published collections of comparable ages and cultural affinities at universities and museums in the northeastern United States and Canada. The ultimate research objective is the construction of a broadly inte- grative model of the origins and interrelations of "Early" and "Middle Woodland" cultures in the northern Mis- sissippi Valley and Upper Great Lakes. A complex his- tory of incised-over-cord-marked pottery (Black Sand Incised in Illinois and Missouri, Dane Incised in Wis- consin, Fox Lake Incised in Minnesota, etc.) is emerging from this research. Carol Mason (University of Wisconsin-Green Bay) has completed for publication a detailed study of the Oneota pottery from the multicomponent Porte des Morts site, Door County. The distributional and stratigraphic analysis of this material confirms the stratigraphic evi- dence at the nearby Mero site of a marked shift in tempering from grit to shell. RONALD J. MASON PLAINS ALBERTA. William J. Byrne and five other students, of the University of Calgary, continued excavations from May to August, 1968, at the summer field school on Trout Creek (see Current Research, American Antiquity, Vol. 33, No. 2: 280). Excavations extended to sites not previ- 210 [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH ously examined in detail. Most sites are camps dating from about 2,000 years ago into the protohistoric period. Ronald M. Getty (University of Calgary) conducted an intensive survey of Willow Creek, west of Claresholm. The survey party spent three months recording 220 sites of the Middle and Late Prehistoric periods, including stone circles, rock alignments, cairns, shelters, bison kills, campsites, and burials. One Late Prehistoric burial, in a small cave, yielded 220 projectile points as well as other chipped stone tools; shell and bone beads; and shell, bone, and tooth pendants. A similar artifact assemblage was found in a nearby dolmen-like glacial erratic. Getty excavated another burial at Writing-On-Stone Provincial Park, well known for its wealth of pictographs. Grave offerings included flakes, bifaces, and projectile points of stone as well as bone and antler flaking tools. In the first week of September, Getty carried out test excavations at the recently discovered site of Fort Calgary, established near the confluence of the Bow and Elbow rivers by the North West Mounted Police in 1875. While only a fraction of the site remains intact, detailed maps of the original post will complement the archaeological work that the site deserves. In cooperation with the Geological Survey of Canada, the University of Calgary participated at a multidisci- plinary project at Medicine Hat for a period of one and one-half months. Overall direction was provided by A. Mac S. Stalker (Geological Survey of Canada), with C. S. Churcher (Royal Ontario Museum) and L. Kisko (University of Toronto) serving as paleontologists. The site is in part Pleistocene, and human remains may be associated with this period. Brian Reeves and C. E. Eyman (University of Calgary) served as consultant archaeologist and human osteologist. Ronald M. Getty directed a crew of six in field excavations. Brian Reeves (University of Calgary), under contract with the National and Historic Sites Service, directed a crew of eight supervised by Leslie B. Davis in Waterton Lakes National Park. The project, of a continuing nature, is essentially aimed at salvage (see Current Research, American Antiquity, Vol. 33, No. 2: 280). Further excavations were carried out at a Cordilleran site, DgPm- 1, and charcoal was secured for dating. New sites excavated include DgPm-1, a camp dating to around A.D. 1850; DgPI-47, a multiple component kill-and-camp site with Pelican Lake and Avonlea occupations; DgPl-1, a strati- fied campsite containing a Late Prehistoric ceramic com- ponent, an earlier component characterized by McKean and Bitteroot points and a still earlier component with stemmed or notched points of a previously undescribed type. The lowest component at DgPl-4, a multiple com- ponent fishing station on Waterton Lake, yielded artifacts of the Early Prehistoric period associated with notched net sinkers and other fishing gear. Of eight additional new sites tested, three contained Early Prehistoric components. Working with a grant from the National Research Council, Reeves supervised Ole Christensen and a crew of three in sampling a site in the Livingstone Gap on the Oldman River (DlPo-20). (See Current Research, Ameri- can Antiquity, Vol. 33, No. 2: 280). Three primary occu- pations were defined, the earliest dating 7570 B.c. + 240 years (GX-0956). The two upper components, one im- mediately below Mazama Ash and the other directly above, produced examples of Bitteroot points. Valuable environ. mental data relative to the southern Canadian Rockies resulted from the work. In the same area, two sites of the Late Middle Prehistoric were excavated. In Manitoba, Leo Pettipas (University of Calgary), with a crew of four, was supported by the National Research Council in explorations of the Swan River Valley. Some 40 specimens of PaleoAIndian affiliation were recorded in local collections. Excavations at three sites of the Middle Prehistoric period produced evidence of a workshop, a fishing station, and a butchering station. Under contract with the National Museum of Canada, the University of Alberta conducted archaeological research at Calling Lake in the boreal forest zone of northern Alberta and in the Cypress Hills of southern Alberta during the summer of 1968. This third season of excavations at Calling Lake, under the direction of Ruth Gruhn, exposed an undisturbed campsite area (GhPh 102) on an old shoreline about 3 m. above present lake level. Artifacts recovered include Oxbow and McKean-like projectile points. Microblades were uncom- mon at this site. In the Cypress Hills, site DjOm 114, exposed in a cut bank of East Battle Creek, was tested by a crew under the direction of Alan Lyle Bryan. This site consists of a series of occupation zones interbedded with alluvial clay to a depth of over 3.5 m.; artifact- bearing layers extend below the present level of the stream to an undetermined depth. The occupation levels yielded mainly flaking detritus. Only three projectile points were recovered from a level 2.5 m. below surface. Further work is planned at this site. MANITOBA. Walter M. Hlady (Manitoba Archaeological Society) reports investigations conducted at the Evans site (a single component Shield Archaic occupation) and at the Rush Bay Road site, just inside of Ontario, where artifacts, attributable to the Shield Archaic, were exposed by road construction. Work was completed at the Richards Kill site, a Besant buffalo kill where 60 com- plete projectile points, a grooved maul, and an effigy atlatl weight were recovered. The Society also conducted investigations at site C3-CA-2, a late ceramic occupation yielding small, unilaterally notched projectile points. MONTANA. Larry A. Lehren (Montana State Univer- sity) investigated the Myers-Hindman site (24PA504), a multicomponent camp area in southwestern Montana. The site contains at least four deposits extending to a depth of 2 m. Projectile point types include Late Plains Side Notch, Pelican Lake, Duncan-Hanna and Scottsbluff, wih the densest deposit associated with the Pelican Lake component. Faunal remains consist of heavily butchered bison, deer, elk, and lesser forms. Lew Napton (University of California, Berkeley) supervised excavations at site 24PW340, in western Mon- tana. Exposed here is an Agate Basin-Frederick-Lusk 211</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY point series, a Besant level, and edge-ground cobbles in the upper strata. George C. Frison (University of Wyoming) investi- gated a stratified bison jump close to the town of Decker. The site displayed a stratified sequence of all known single component sites in the area. Frison also discovered a new source of obsidian near the town of Kirby. WYOMING. George C. Frison (State Archaeologist, Department of Anthropology, University of Wyoming) has directed investigations at various sites throughout the state in cooperation with chapters of the Wyoming Archaeological Society. At an Early Middle period site near Eden-Farson, Wyoming, excavations revealed a habi- tation area containing roasting pits and stone artifacts diagnostic of the period. A Late Middle period occupa- tion was investigated by Frison and Louis Steege in the right-of-way of an Interstate Highway near Cheyenne. Another Late Middle period site was found near Pump- kin Buttes. This is a bison kill site associated with par- tially preserved remnants of a large corral; a ceremonial structure covered by 11 ft. of sterile soil; and a camp area. Exploratory excavations were conducted at a large, undisturbed bison jump near Glenrock. This site is close to an Interstate Highway, and the state hopes to develop it as an interpretive center. Present evidence indicates that the site was used for several hundred years during the Late Prehistoric period. Historic Sites Archaeology was initiated near Pinedale where Frison attempted to discover the actual locations of rendezvous sites dealing with early fur traders and Mountain Men. One positive result was the location of Fort Bonneville on the Green River, near Daniel. Frison also investigated sites of a number of obsidian sources in the state. NORTH DAKOTA. Richard B. Johnston led an eight- man Smithsonian River Basin Surveys crew in a two- month session at the South Cannonball Village (32SI19) in the upper reaches of the Oahe Reservoir. It was the third and final season of excavation at this large, unfor- tified settlement of semisubterranean rectangular lodges on a high terrace south of the confluence of the Cannon- ball and Missouri rivers. The village is related to Fort Yates phase components of the Extended Middle Missouri horizon. During the 1968 season three additional excavations were completed, one in a section of the village between houses and two in house structures. The former was begun in a sizable surface depression thought to be a house. Instead, a series of irregular pits of variable plan and depth were discovered, together with a number of randomly distributed post holes, and a moderate collec- tion of debris. The 80- by 30-ft. area exposed resembled the intrahouse sections seen in the large area cleared two years earlier, and it is thought that the 1968 excava- tion provided additional data from a portion of the settlement between houses that had been the scene of considerable activity during the life of the site. The second major excavation during the 1968 season at the South Cannonball site was over half of the long axis of a large surface depression, and in this case the remains of a large rectangular lodge were discovered. The floor of the excavated pit proved to be over 60 ft. in length and is estimated, from the portion uncovered, to have a width of 30 ft. An inclined ramp extended up from the floor, which was about 2-3 ft. below the surface origi- nally, and out the southwest end of the pit through an entry structure projecting some 10 ft. beyond the pit. In the excavated half of the lodge there were 110 side and end wall posts and 55 other post holes scattered elsewhere over the floor, including a massive king-post at the rear wall and two other major ridgepole supports at the center and front wall along the midline. In addition to a num- ber of cache pits and burnt areas on the floor, a large circular fireplace was found spanning the centerline not far inside the entrance, and toward the rear a large trench-like pit extended across about half the width of the floor. Some 16 pit features were also found nearby outside of this large structure. The third excavation in 1968 also revealed a rectangu- lar lodge and brought to seven the number of such structures examined at the South Cannonball site. This house was smaller and had proportions more square than most others uncovered at the site, although its dimensions approximate those of the small structure examined during the first season of work. The pit had been dug to a depth of 2 to 3 ft. below the surface and was made 35 ft. long and 25 ft. wide. Fifty-four post holes were found along the sides of the house and across the front of the pit, but there was none at the rear wall except a sizable king-post. Two large post holes on either side of the centerline at the front of the pit appeared to form a doorway and are thought to have supported a lintel beam upon which a large ridgepole rested. No evidence was discovered of an entryway extending beyond the house itself. For the second consecutive year, two Smithsonian Institution-National Science Foundation Undergraduate Summer Research Assistants participated in River Basin Surveys activities during the 1968 field season. The two students, from the University of North Carolina and Wake Forest University, were assigned to the group excavating the South Cannonball Village in the upper Oahe region; during the season they gained a thorough grounding in all aspects of site investigation, from the purposes and strategy of excavation through methodology to management of the collection and records. At the end of the season, they returned to the River Basin Surveys facility in Lincoln where they devoted the remainder of their 10-week tour to familiarizing themselves with tech- nical operations in the laboratory and office. Donald J. Lehmer and W. Raymond Wood jointly directed field work in early summer and early fall at several village sites along the Missouri River between the Garrison and Oahe reservoirs. This project, spon- sored by Northern Natural Gas Company, Dana College, and the University of Missouri, tested 16 sites in the northern half of the Knife-Heart district between the towns of Stanton and Sanger, in Oliver and Mercer counties. Samples were obtained from sites ranging in age from Extended Middle Missouri (Clark's Creek) 212 [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH through historic Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara villages (Amahami, Fort Clark). The data obtained significantly augment the local culture sequence and its relationships with complexes farther south along the Missouri. Since the mouth of the Knife River marks the northwestern- most limit of effective horticulture in North America, sampling techniques were geared to obtain maximum recovery of material, especially floral and faunal data relevant to problems in cultural ecology. A field crew from the State Historical Society of North Dakota, under the direction of James Sperry assisted by John S. Sigstad, spent the first half of the summer at the Havens site, 32EM1, on the east bank of the Missouri River appproximately 5 mi. north of the North Dakota- South Dakota border. This work was accomplished under a cooperative agreement with the National Park Service, for salvage in the Oahe Reservoir. The Havens site is a large village of the Extended horizon of the Middle Missouri tradition. The site has never been cultivated, and depressions marking the location of 56 long-rectangu- lar houses are present in the native sod. Two houses and a number of exterior features were excavated, and a large specimen collection was made from the edge of the terrace where the site is rapidly undergoing erosion from the reservoir waters. The second half of the season was spent south of Stanton. This project was accomplished through an agreement with the North Dakota State Highway Depart- ment for highway salvage authorized by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads. Extensive excavations were conducted at the Big White site (32ME4), and testing was carried out at the White Buffalo Robe site (32ME7) within the limits of the highway right-of-way. One circular lodge, a large number of exterior features, and a portion of the fortification ditch and palisade were excavated at the Big White site. This site had previously been identified as one of the historic Mandan villages visited by Lewis and Clark. The complete lack of trade materials and the presence of an earlier ceramic complex indicate that at least the southern portion of the site stems from an earlier occupation. Only a small amount of material was recov- ered at the White Buffalo Robe site where testing showed the highway right-of-way to be outside of the major area of occupation. Archaeological survey has begun in Theodore Roose- velt National Memorial Park in Billings and McKenzie counties. This project is progressing under an agreement with the National Park Service. SOUTH DAKOTA. Oscar L. Mallory was in the field for three weeks directing the activities of a Smithsonian River Basin Surveys crew in a shoreline reconnaissance of the upper section of the Lake Sharpe-Big Bend Reservoir. It was a cooperative venture between Michael Kelly (W. H. Over Dakota Museum) and Robert Gant (South Dakota State Historical Society). The purpose of the survey was two-fold: first, it was intended as a search for undiscovered sites exposed by wave and/or slumping as a consequence of reservoir construction and to make some investigation of these and known sites undergoing similar damage. The second objective was to make a preliminary examination of exposed stratigraphy bearing upon the recent geologic history of the river valley for its potential as an indicator of past environmental conditions hat might, in turn, reflect upon the use and occupancy of the region during prehistory. During the survey, five new sites were located on the Hughes County side of the Big Bend Reservoir between Medicine Knoll Creek and Cow Creek. All are certain or putative Woodland components. On the oppo- site bank, two sites of Middle Missouri affinities and two sites of probable Woodland origin were found along the same section of the reservoir. Though the individual Woodland sites are small, the combined group, clustered in an area of less than 5 mi., seems to suggest the poten- tial of a study of fossil soils of the region and their rela- tionship to Woodland use of the valley. NEBRASKA. During the 1968 summer field school ses- sion, the Department of Anthropology, University of Nebraska, in cooperation with the National Park Service, executed urgent salvage research at the stratified Walker Gilmore site, along Sterns Creek, in eastern Cass County. Excavations focused upon the south bank of the Sterns Creek where four primary levels of the second com- ponent occupations, bounded by layers of blue clays or sands, were located. During June of 1968, two sites in the path of Interstate 80 in western Nebraska were investigated by the Highway Salvage Archaeologist, Gayle Carlson. A Supplemental Agreement between the Nebraska State Historical Society and the State Department of Roads made this work possible. One of these sites, 25DU2, located about a mile south of Chappell, in Deuel County, is the location of a station or road ranch built alongside the Oregon Trail. The remains of one building, apparently a frame struc- ture, measuring 21.5 x 16.5 ft. were uncovered, plus a number of exterior postmolds and five trash pits. One exterior rock-filled pit that may have served as a hearth or forge was also found. The large artifact inventory includes numerous cartridge cases, all of them rimfire except two early centerfire types; firearms parts; military buttons and insignia; square nails; tin cans; bottles; win- dow glass; oxen shoes; horse and mule shoes; wagon and harness hardware; building hardware; dutch oven and stove parts; personal articles, kitchen utensils, and small tools. An occupation during the 1860's is suggested from the information recovered. The other site investigated in Deuel County, 25DU3, proved to be of Plains Woodland affiliation. The remainder of the summer was spent in routine surveying of the rights-of-way of proposed highway proj- ects. Eight new sites were discovered, and several previ- ously known sites that were endangered by future highway construction were visited and tested. Archaeological work included testing of the area behind the Nebraska Statehood Memorial, the recently restored Thomas P. Kennard home. This house, built in 1869 and the home of the first Nebraska Secretary of State, once included a rear wing, now demolished. Test 213</page><page sequence="16">214 AMERICAN excavations located the basement walls of this wing pre- paratory to future reconstruction. Evidence of an out- building at the rear of the lot has also been uncovered and is being investigated. Carl Hugh Jones (new Curator of Anthropology, Nebraska State Historical Society) made a survey of J4, a Soil Conservation Reservoir in Gage County. The only site found was one reported and tested previously by the State Game Commission and John Champe. It appears to be a lithic site, perhaps related to the nearby out- croppings of southern Nehawka flint. Another project has been to prepare a report on the four southeastern coun- ties in the state, Johnson, Pawnee, Richardson, and Nemaha counties, for the Department of Economic Development under an Urban Planning Grant Contract. Included is a summary of the archaeology of the area, a comment on the known sites, and suggestions on how several of the sites might be developed into economic assets for the local community. During the process of preparing this report, the number of sites recorded for the area was doubled and now totals 55. Fourteen of these sites are the result of field work done by the Uni- versity of Nebraska and the University of Kansas during the past summer. Alfred E. Johnson (University of Kansas)) led a field school crew in limited excavations at the Leary site (25RH1). Several cache pits and three human burials were excavated at this Oneota village dating about A.D. 1650 in southeastern Nebraska. KANSAS. During the summer of 1968, Alfred E. John- son (University of Kansas) and Patricia O'Brien (Kansas State University) directed a second session of the Great Plains Archaeological Field School. The field school, jointly managed by the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, and Wichita State University, and sup- ported by a grant from the Advanced Science Education Program of the Division of Graduate Education in Science of the National Science Foundation, provided training for 19 students from universities around the country. Head- quarters for the school were at White Cloud, northeast- ern Kansas. Excavations were conducted in several sites in the White Cloud vicinity. Codirector Patricia O'Brien, with approximately one- half of the student group, excavated the Taylor Burial Mound (14DP3). This site is repeatedly mentioned in the archaeological literature on Kansas because of the large number of burials (57) reportedly removed from it in 1914 and because it is the largest such mound reported for the State of Kansas. Despite extensive disturbance from prior relic collecting, information was derived on two burial patterns: (1) cremations located in an orange- burnt layer overlying a central, limestone, slab cist, and (2) bundle burials in the cist representing the remains of eight individuals. The mound has tentatively been assigned to the Valley focus of the Plains Woodland phase. In addition to the excavations at Taylor Mound, stu- dent participants were provided with a variety of other excavation experiences. Included were excavations at the ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969 Kelley site (14DP1 1) a two-component, Archaic and Kansas City Hopewell, site (ca. 2000 B.C. and A.D. 1). A random sample of 60 two-meter squares was com- pleted, and a probable Hopewell structure was excavated. The structure, an oval pit house measuring about 4.0 m. in length and 3.0 m. in width, is the first identified house remains associated with the Kansas City Hopewell complex. At the Nuzum site (14DP10), an earth-lodge village of the Nebraska culture dating to about A.D. 1200, a large earth-lodge was excavated. Heavy earth-moving equip- ment was used to remove the overburden. Although difficult to define, and not productive of artifacts, the house did appear to be a typical Nebraska culture earth- lodge in form, although about three times as large as is usual. A short period was devoted to test excavations at site 14DP26. At this site, one human burial, associated with historic grave goods and including a flint-lock gun barrel, a metal pan, and a copper bell, was excavated. In addition, a portion of the field-school period was devoted to a series of excavations at the Bridwell site (14GR38) near Eureka. The Bridwell site is a deep, strati- fied site on Fall River northwest of Eureka. The site, which covers about 10 acres, has at least three separable levels of human occupation. The most recent, which probably dates to about A.D. 1000 and is a local variety of the Central Plains phase, is present from the surface of the ground to a depth of about 25 cm. Below this level, at depths of about 1.0 m. and 1.75 m. are earlier Wood land and probable Archaic complexes. Although artifacts and features are common in all three major occupation levels, the three zones are separated by horizons bearing little cultural debris. A field party directed by Lawrence Bradley and Marc Rucker (Museum of Anthropology, University of Kansas) spent the summer of 1968 testing and excavating archaeo- logical sites along the Marmaton River in the proposed Fort Scott Reservoir area. The project was supported by a contract with the National Park Service. This area, in Bourbon County, southeast Kansas, is little known archaeologically. Previous archaeological investigations in Bourbon County have been limited to surveys by the Smithsonian Institution, River Basin Surveys in 1963 (6 sites reported) and by a field party from the University of Kansas in 1967 (15 sites reported). The 1968 field party recorded an additional seven sites in the reservoir area. These seven sites, and six of the previously recorded sites, were excavated from June 15 to August 15. Of the 13 sites tested, only 5 yielded features below the plow zone. It was concluded that the other eight sites had been destroyed by continuous farming activities and erosion. The old town of Marmaton, the first county seat of Bourbon County, which was burned as a result of events during the Civil War, was tested. The town well was excavated, and the remains of several foundations were noted. Site 14BO20 was tested by means of a trench, 50 cm. in width and 65 m. in length, which revealed subsurface</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH concentrations of bone and burned stone and a shallow basin filled with burned earth. A road grader was used to strip the plow zone from an area adjacent to the trench, and excavations in the scraped area exposed additional shallow basins and a pit filled wtih charred nut fragments. Excavations at 14BO26 revealed a midden containing bone and stone artifacts, a limited ceramic sample, and five tightly flexed burials. The burials, encountered within the limits of the midden, lacked associated artifacts. Excavations on 14B03 and 14BO18 revealed a sparse scattering of cultural material below the plow zone, but not in quantities sufficient to warrant extensive testing. The cultural material collected thus far seems to constitute a loosely related but distinct configuration not defined elsewhere. Specific elemehts and similarities may be seen in various contexts in other portions of Kansas, southwestern Missouri, and northeastern Oklahoma. The University of Kansas conducted salvage excava- tions for 9 weeks in the planned El Dorado Reservoir, along Walnut River, south-central Kansas. Tyler Bastian, assisted by Roger Grosser and a crew of six, worked at six sites. The Snyder site (14BU9) has two super- imposed cultural zones separated by a sterile stratum. The upper zone consists of cultivated soil above inter- mittent sheet midden, postmolds, and refuse-filled basins which extend into and sometimes through the under- lying sterile stratum. Typical artifacts include small corner-notched points, small ovate-acuminate knives (or points?), chipped stone celts, and a few cord-marked sherds. Three of the 10 shallow basin-shaped pits con- tained diagnostic artifacts, and one included portions of a disarticulated adult human skeleton. The postmolds suggest the presence of at least two structures in which the posts are spaced about 2 m. apart. An oval structure measures 4 by 7 m. and has several sets of paired posts. A round structure is about 11 m. in diameter. The gen- eral cultural relationships of the upper zone are late Woodland dating about A.D. 800. The lower zone at the Snyder site extends from 60 to 225 cm. below the present surface of the ground and is separated from the upper zone by a sterile stratum 30 cm. thick. Artifacts from the lower zone include moderately large points with broad corner notches or expanding stems, large ovate knives, and concentrations of burned limestone rocks. The com- plex appears to be related to late Archaic materials which were excavated in the John Redmond Reservoir by the Kansas State Historical Society and dated about 1500 B.c. The Milboum site (14BU25) is an artifact-bearing zone 100 cm. thick buried 130 cm. below the surface and exposed in the walls of a gully above a tributary of the Walnut River. The artifacts include large corner-notched points, drills, knives, and concentrations of burned lime- stone rocks. Cultural relationships seem to be primarily with preceramic assemblages to the east. The other four sites excavated proved to be of rela- tively little interest because undisturbed cultural remains were sparse or absent and because their major com- ponents seem to be represented at the Snyder and Mil- bourn sites. In addition to the cultural complexes which have been excavated, artifacts suggestive of the Central Plains phase have been found in various parts of the reservoir, but permission was not obtained to excavate the only site where they are relatively abundant. A com- ponent of the Great Bend aspect is located on the West Branch of the Walnut a few miles west of the reservoir, but nothing suggestive of the Great Bend aspect has been noted in the reservoir. An archaeological surface survey was conducted be- tween June 1 and August 1, 1968. The survey was con- ducted for the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Kansas by John Eoff and Lawrence Quade. The salvage project was funded by the National Park Service and had as its objective the location of Indian sites which may be destroyed by planned watershed constructions in Kansas and Nebraska. The survey began in Shawnee County, south of Topeka, in the Wakarusa River Watershed. Here 45 sites were located, most of which are on first terrace step above the Wakarusa and its tributaries. The sites con- sisted of light scatterings of chert over small areas, with only occasional artifacts on the surface. Sherds were particularly scarce. Many of the sites are eroding out of the terraces above the creeks, which may partially account for the small number of artifacts found (i.e., they remain buried). According to preliminary analysis, 2 Archaic components were found, 7 Woodland components, 2 Keith focus components, 1 Upper Republican component, 14 Central Plains components, and 5 Historic compo- nents. The cultural affiliation of many sites is unde- termined. There were at least seven multicomponent sites. The second phase of the survey was based in Marshall County, Kansas, and included the Nebraska counties of Pawnee and Gage. Some 16 creeks and rivers were involved; these are subsumed into the Irish Creek, North Black Vermillion, Upper Black Vermillion, and Mission Creek Watersheds. Eighty-one sites were located, repre- senting at least five Archaic components, four Woodland components, four Central Plains components, one Ne- braska aspect component, and one Historic component. It is notable that several large and unquestionable Archaic and Woodland sites were found in these watersheds. Further, the Archaic sites were found at considerably higher elevations than a first terrace, and frequently at some distance from the creek bed. Consequently, there is a possibility that Archaic sites have been missed in previous surveys, due to their unexpected locations. On one site, along a recently constructed water channel, a profile was cut and revealed two habitation levels, in addition to one on the surface. Cultural affiliations are presently indeterminable. The third phase of the survey was located in Dick- inson and Marion counties. A profile was cut in one creek bank, displaying an extensive site of at least four occupa- tion levels. Cultural affiliations are as yet undetermined. The Kansas State Historical Society's major field project concerned the continuing work at the site of old Fort Hays, a U.S. Army fort from 1867 until 1889. The archaeological work primarily consists of ground outlining 215</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the original fort buildings and excavating for artifacts to be utilized in museum displays. A new visitor's center building will soon be constructed at the site to be utilized along with the still-standing guardhouse, blockhouse, and one officers' quarters structure. Tom Barr directed a crew of seven laborers in the completion of the ground out- lining of buildings along officers' row as well as two of the enlisted men's barracks on the east and west side of the parade-ground area. Currently Tom Barr is directing a crew of seven laborers in the archaeological work at Fort Scott. The original old Fort Scott was constructed in the 1840's and is now located in downtown Fort Scott, Kansas. The city of Fort Scott recently obtained a large federal grant to rehabilitate the existing buildings from the fort and to reconstruct many others in order that this area may be converted into a historic site. The work is being carried out under contract with the National Park Service whose staff is handling the technical aspects of the fort's recon- struction for the city. Final details are being added to the new museum proj- ect at the Kansas Monument site. The new Pawnee Indian Village Museum constructed there is now con- nected by a new highway, K266, to US36 between Court- land and Scandia, Kansas. During June of this year Tom Witty excavated the remains of two earth lodges which lay in the path of the new highway. These lodges were located in the southern half of the village which has always lain on private ground. Both lodges were badly damaged by cultivation and casual digging. In July four days were spent excavating a Salina focus, Smoky Hill aspect earth lodge just east of Salina. This work was carried out as the summer dig for the state's amateur society, the Kansas Anthropological Association. Historical Society archaeologists, Tom Witty and Jim Marshall, directed the Association members in exposing the floor of a 38-ft.-square house. The pattern of post holes as well as recovered artifacts were very similar to those found near the Whiteford site just a few miles to the east. Jim Marshall is conducting an appraisal survey of the Grove Reservoir area located just northwest of Topeka. This project is in cooperation with the National Park Service. Tom Witty has begun a survey of the LaCyne Lake in east-central Kansas, which is to be constructed by two local power companies. IOWA. The Office of State Archaeologist and the Uni- versity of Iowa, Iowa City, jointly sponsored six inde- pendent field projects during the summer of 1968. Mar- shall McKusick, Associate Professor and State Archae- ologist, continued previous research of historic sites by investigating the area settled by Julian Dubuque from 1788-1810, a Spanish land-grant settlement in northeast Iowa. No trace of the original settlement was located, the structures uncovered dating after the 1820's from ceramic identifications. Adrian Anderson, Assistant Director and Lecturer, completed excavations at the Walter's site (13 JH-42), a late Woodland-occupation site. The site is located in Coralville Reservoir north of Iowa City, and the work was partially supported by the Na- tional Park Service. William Vinall (graduate student at the University of Iowa) directed excavations at the Fish Farm Mound Preserve (13AM-100) in northeast Iowa. The Woodland material was sparse, but considerable information was obtained on soil morphology and inter- pretation by Wayne Scholtes (Iowa State University, Ames) which adds to the archaeological context of the mound group. The work of both Vinall and Scholtes was financed by the State Preserve Board. Dean Straffin (graduate student at the University of Iowa) excavated at the Kingston site (13DM-3) in south- east Iowa, with funds provided by the State Preserves Board. It is a multicomponent Woodland site and includes an Oneota occupation. Preliminary analysis sug- gests a greater Middle Mississippian influence at the Kingston site than is reported at previously investigated Iowa Oneota sites. Robert Alex (graduate student at the University of Iowa) excavated at several Woodland sites continuing his research in Middle Woodland paleo- ecology. These sites were located in north-central Iowa. Larry Zimmerman (a student at the University of Iowa) excavated at the Skadeland site (13 CK-402) in northwest Iowa. Preliminary identification of the ceramics suggests the site was a late Mill Creek occupation. The excavation was supported by the Northwest Chapter of the Iowa Archaeological Society and the Sanford Museum, Cherokee. OKLAHOMA. Between May and October, 1968, the Oklahoma River Basin Survey Project, University of Oklahoma, Norman, has been involved with two field projects. From May 12 to June 13, Don G. Wyckoff directed work at the Robinson-Solesbee site (Hs-9) in the Robert S. Kerr Lock and Dam area, an Arkansas River Navigational project in Haskell and Sequoyah counties, eastern Oklahoma. The Robinson-Solesbee site extends over 30 acres of a sandy terrace in the Haskell County bottom lands of the Arkansas Valley. Controlled surface collecting indicated several distinct areas of habitation. Utilizing a bulldozer the plowed soil was graded from these areas as well as intervening locales. This work revealed several clusters of occupational features which, when combined, totaled 2 rectangular house patterns, a third, poorly-defined house location, 34 trash pits, and an erosional feature apparently utilized as a trash recep- tacle. The material assemblage is internally consistent and is thought to relate to a 16th-century occupation. Culturally, the Robinson-Solesbee site can be affiliated with the Fulton aspect of the Caddoan area sequence. More specifically, the site apears to represent one of several phases generally included in the Ft. Coffee focus. The second field project was the excavation of two sites in the Oologah Reservoir locale (Nowata County) on the Verdigris River, northeastern Oklahoma. Terry J. Prewitt directed this work from June 6 through August 20; Robert J. Burton was field assistant. Excavations were at the Lawrence site (Nw-6) and the Lightning Creek site (Nw-8). The Lawrence site was exposed in the Verdigris bank and was an occupational surface buried by some [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969 216</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT RESEARCH 5 ft. of overburden. Excavation of the occupational zone indicated about 5 ft. of cultural-bearing fill in which horizontal concentrations of burned limestone rocks occurred. The recovered artifacts suggest a Woodland period occupation; artifacts include large and small projectile points, knives, scrapers, a canine tooth pendant, an unfinished gorget, bone awls, and other tools relating to a hunting-and-gathering economy. There were, how- ever, no ceramics. The Lightning Creek site was a small open camp on a creek terrace 4 mi. from the Lawrence site. Artifacts recovered from Lightning Creek also indi- cate a hunting-gathering-oriented component which bears some resemblance to the Lawrence site. The Museum of the Great Plains has pursued a num- ber of short-term projects in southwestern Oklahoma. The Gore Pit site, east of Lawton, which has yielded burnt rock middens of the Archaic period and a well-preserved and articulated burial, as excavated. The skeleton was of a mature male not over 24 years of age attributable to the eastern Archaic racial variant. The discovery of such an "Iswanid" type in western Oklahoma raises questions as to the westernmost distribution of the type on the Plains. There were no associated artifacts to aid in determining the cultural context of the burial. Due to recent flooding in the northern extreme of Kiowa County on the flood plain of Otter Creek near Snyder, a habitation layer was exposed yielding innumer- able Archaic points with right-angle shoulders and straight bases similar to examples commonly found in the Edwards Plateau aspect of Texas. In addition to the lithic material, a brief rescue excavation produced stake holes of a small circular hut. The Domebo Canyon in Caddo County north of Lawton, the scene of Oklahoma's first man-mammoth association, continues to provide Paleo-Indian projectile points and evidence of a varied Pleistocene fauna in the stream outwash. Other stream beds in the immediate vicinity and much of the Tonkawa Creek watershed are being explored on a systematic basis with the aid of a National Park Service grant. ROBERT W. NEUMAN GREAT BASIN CALIFORNIA. Surprise Valley. During the past three years, archaeological investigations in the form of site survey and excavation have been conducted in the Sur- prise Valley of northeastern California by students of the University of California at Berkeley under the direc- tion of J. F. O'Connell, with the assistance of R. D. Ambro and C. R. Corson. The objectives of the research are: (1) to establish the archaeological sequence in Sur- prise Valley and neighboring areas of the Great Basin; (2) to determine aboriginal patterns of subsistence and settlement in this area, with particular attention to evi- dence for seasonal variation in such patterns; (3) to clarify the nature of cultural relationships between the northwestern Great Basin and neighboring areas of Cali- fornia and the Columbia Plateau. Field work may be summarized briefly. An intensive site survey of the valley has revealed the existence of over 50 sites, including temporary camps, quarry sites, and chipping stations, as well as a number of deep, stratified open occupation sites. Limited excavations have been carried out at three deep sites, all located along the shores of the extensive playa lakes which dominate the valley floor. A report on one of these has been published recently ("A Preliminary Report on the Archaeology of the Rodriguez Site (CA-Las-194), Lassen County, Cali- fornia," J. F. O'Connell and R. D. Ambro; University of California Arch. Survey Report No. 73, 1968). Reasonable progress on the research objectives has been achieved. A regional sequence has been established, extending from about 2500 B.C. to A.D. 1300. However, information on the terminal phase of the prehistoric occu- pation is still lacking, with the result that the archaeo- logical sequence cannot be firmly connected with the ethnographic period. Further, though much is now known about the character of occupation on the valley floor, little work has been done on sites located at high altitude. Research scheduled for the coming season will be aimed at correcting these deficiencies. OREGON. Fort Rock. Stephen F. Bedwell (University of Oregon) reports that the Fort Rock Lake area, recog- nized as an area of major archaeological importance since 1938, is now yielding further significant data. In the summer of 1966, under a grant provided by the National Science Foundation, new excavations were begun at Fort Rock Cave under the direction of L. S. Cressman, and a new survey of the area was undertaken. In the following summer, with increased National Science Foundation support, further excavations were carried out at Fort Rock Cave after removal of several large boulders in and around the mouth of the cave. Excavations were also begun on newly located sites at the Connley Hills, Table Rock, Sevenmile Ridge, and Cougar Mountain. Work on these sites produced over 2,000 artifacts, a large number of which were found below a layer of volcanic ash identified as having come from the Mount Mazama eruption dated at around 7,000 years ago. At present there is some indication that two distinct culture units may be represented below the ash layer, the earliest of the two having much the greater time depth. Levels above the ash layer appear to have a reduced artifact content which does not begin to increase once more in quantity until later (at a time period yet to be established) and then remains essentially unchanged until late times. The earliest date in the area, from charcoal found on the top of the beach gravels in Fort Rock Cave, proved to be 11,250 B.c. + 720 (GaK-1738), based on a half life of 5,570 years. At Cougar Mountain a date of 10,000 B.c. ? 350 (GaK-1751) was reported, and the earliest date at the Connley Hills proved to be 8150 B.c. + 400 (GaK-1742). These and 29 additional dates (some still in the process of being run) should provide a cultural sequence in this area extending from the time of the earliest date at Fort Rock Cave through the post-contact period. 217</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Resemblances can be seen for both excavated and surface finds from the Fort Rock area with material from sites to the north, east, and south. In the early period, some parallels seem to exist with sites in the Washington State area and with sites on the Snake River plain. The greatest resemblances, however, appear to lie toward the south, particularly with materials from the Mojave Lake and Borax Lake sites where similarities with artifact classes and their combined complexes seem to be strong. In addition to archaeological investigations in the Fort Rock area, work has been done toward learning more about the history of the lake itself. A date has been secured on an ancient shoreline of the lake through the radiocarbon dating of shell found in the beach gravels of an old terrace. This date, supported by Carbon 12/Carbon 13 analysis, has been given as 11,030 B.c. + 230 (GaK- 1752). This, together with other data, should provide not only a better understanding of the lake history but should contribute also toward an increased knowledge of the ecological setting encountered at various periods in time by the inhabitants of the area. Analysis of cultural and other material from the area is still in progress. A report is expected some time in 1969. WILBUR A. DAVIS CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. Mark Kowta (University of California, Riverside) is continuing his archaeological survey of Joshua Tree National Monument -a project begun by William Wallace. The Riverside survey group is concentrating on the Baker Dam area of the Monument. Excavation of a cemetery in Trancas Canyon, on the Los Angeles coast, was completed in late spring, 1968, and is now in analysis. The work was a volunteer project sponsored jointly by the University of California at Los Angeles, Archaeological Survey, and the Malibu Archaeo- logical Society as a salvage project. The project was codirected by John Beaton of the Survey and John Ewins of the MAS. The cemetery was radiocarbon dated at 520 B.c. + 58 (UCLA-1370) and produced 104 burials, with a general paucity of associated artifacts. Site 4-LAn-40 on Zuma Mesa near Malibu, which was excavated in 1963 by the UCLA Archaeological Survey, is being destroyed by modern construction and was briefly reinvestigated by the Survey and the Malibu Archaeological Society, under the direction of John Ewins. The site, of the Millingstone horizon, was sampled for midden constituents and was graded in search of struc- tures. The latter operation, however, was a failure. An archaeological survey of Catalina Island is being conducted under the direction of Gary E. Stickel, in cooperation with the Catalina Laboratory for Archae- ology, and is being expanded into a large-scale, open- ended research program. Excavations funded by the State Division of Highways through the Department of Parks and Recreation were conducted this summer at the Big Tujunga site (LAn- 167), under the direction of N. Nelson Leonard III. The excavation took the form of extensive area exposures exploring the characteristics of the widespread rock fea- tures which are typical of this site. The results of the excavation are now in analysis. The field crews of the Pacific Coast Archaeological Society (Costa Mesa), under the direction of Duane Hafner and Lavon Burnham, began work in November, 1967, at the Coyote Canyon Cave site (Ora-236). The site is a large rockshelter in the San Joaquin Hills 4 mi. from Newport Bay. The deposit, however, is a 4-ft.-deep shell midden. The artifacts and two reburials so far recovered suggest several different cultural assemblages are present. More work is planned at the site in the fall and winter of 1968-69. During January and February, 1968, the same crews sampled the Buck Gully #2 site (Ora-189). A large semisubterranean structure was trenched, and a typical Late period artifact assemblage was present. The site is adjacent to Ora-190 where Lester Ross excavated a similar structure in 1967. Both sites were destroyed during the spring for a housing development. During the summer of 1968, the Pacific Coast Archaeo- logical Society's crews sampled three sites. On June 8 and 9, Pat Robinson directed operations at the Los Pinos site (Ora-35) in the Santa Ana Mountains. Numerous small, triangular projectile points, broken deer bones, manos, and bedrock mortars characterize the site as a fall camp for gathering acorns and hunting deer. In late July, Robinson sampled the Fossil Canyon site (Ora-91) on the edge of upper Newport Bay. The midden contained great quantities of shells, but artifacts, faunal bone, and waste stone flakes were nearly absent. In August, Paul Chace directed excavations at the Waterfall site (Ora- 209) 11/2 mi. from the bay. The site, located near a natural water tank at the base of a waterfall, is a shell midden which contained few artifacts. Apparently both Ora-91 and Ora-209 were seasonal shellfish-gathering camps occupied only briefly each year. The California State College, Fullerton, field class spent the spring semester working at Ora-198 near Corona Del Mar, under the direction of Thomas Tatlock. The field class from California State College, Los Angeles, under the direction of Hal Eberhart, conducted excavations at the Strandt #7 site (Ora-83) near Hunt- ington Beach. Over 100 cogged stones have been reported from this site as surface finds, but only 12 artifacts were removed from the excavation. The class also obtained shell samples from Ora-58, previously excavated, for radiocarbon age determination. Archaeological Explorer Post #806, sponsored by the Pacific Coast Archaeological Society, for high school-age boys and girl, under the direction of John Johnson com- pleted sampling excavations during the spring at Ora-160. Few artifacts were recovered from the dense shell midden deposit. The site is scheduled for destruction in the near future. Catherine Anderson (California State College, Long Beach) has completed the preliminary report on the North Bay # 1 site (Ora-193). This stratified site on the water's 218 [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT RESEARCH edge at Newport is 8 ft. deep with 15 natural stratigraphic layers and 5 major occupation zones. Dee Hudson (California State College, Long Beach) has reanalyzed the Santiago Canyon site worked by the government S.E.R.A. and W.P.A. crews in 1934 and 1935. By studying the original journals, catalogs, and the col- lections he has produced an updated, descriptive mono- graph. The site contained cremations, cremated reburials, and flexed interments as well as pottery pipes, arrowshaft straighteners, large ceremonial mortars, five deer bone whistles, and small, triangular projectile points. These Late period traits are rare in this area and suggest the site was an important ceremonial location. Hudson has also completed an inventory of all the W.P.A. archaeological collections housed since 1938 at Santa Ana College. The collections include artifacts from eight sites the W.P.A. excavated in Orange County during the mid-1930's. During October, 1968, Paul Chace (Charles W. Bow- ers Memorial Museum) and Paul Long (Golden West College) directed excavations at the site of the Sepulveda hacienda (1837-1860), an adobe building first built by Mission San Juan Capistrano as a cattle station. Evidence of the building was limited to plow-scattered floor tile. A large collection of local Indian and imported ceramics was secured. CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. Several students from Sacra- mento State College have been active in research projects leading to M.A. degrees. Michael McEachern's thesis covers a survey made in Calaveras, Tuolumne, and Amador counties in an effort to define the extent of mortuary use of caves. Fifteen such sites were located, and four phases have been defined through artifactual analysis. Paul Armstrong is working in the area around the Loughridge site (Sac-225) on a distributional study of bedrock mortars. Kent Smith is surveying the Cosum- nes River drainage from Bridge House toward the east to extend the intensive survey coverage which has been done around the Loughridge site. Sacramento State students Don Wood and Roland Gage are working with the materials from 4-Sac-29. The site was reexcavated with funds provided by the Cali- fornia Highway Salvage Program, under the direction of William Pritchard. Another graduate student, Mark Grady, is undertaking an analysis of the materials from the Augustine site (4-Sac-127) near Sloughhouse. This collection is the result of a salvage excavation conducted at the behest of the landowner when he uncovered burials while leveling an area immediately adjacent to the mound on the north. Approximately 150 individuals (mostly flexed) were recovered from an area of some 75 ft. in diameter. Field work in the Auburn-Folsom Reservoir area under the direction of J. Glen Childress and Eric Ritter (Uni- versity of California, Davis) commenced on July 15, 1968, and was essentially terminated on October 1, 1968. Exca- vation was resumed from the previous year at 4-Eld-93 where two additional burials were recovered, both appar- ently flexed on their side. Other items recovered include numerous projectile points, pestles, steatite pendants, and other artifacts. The main portion of the 1968 field season was spent on the Foresthill Divide at Pla-101 which had been briefly tested the year before. Aside from a preponderance of projectile points, there is a large concentration of grinding and core tools, at a depth of about 50 cm., which may indicate a living surface. Apparently there are two dis- tinct complexes of occupation, the first quite recent and the second apparently much older. Pla-36, a large chert quarry site, with a maximum depth of 70 cm. was also sampled. Several tons of lithic material were recovered for future analysis. The National Park Service issued a contract-purchase order to Thomas King, now Chief Archaeologist of the University of California, Los Angeles, Archaeological Survey, for reconnaissance of the Corps of Engineers' proposed Newhall-Saugus Project, Santa Clara Basin, in Los Angeles County. In a report published by the Department of Parks and Recreation, William Olsen and Louis Payen describe their archaeological excavations in the Little Panoche Valley in west Fresno County, which included two villages with pre-1765 radiocarbon dates. Of special interest at one of these sites was the discovery of a small sweathouse, archi- tecturally similar to Southwestern structures. This work was performed under the direction of the National Park Service with funds provided by the Bureau of Reclamation. William Wallace of California State College, Long Beach, reports that his reconnaissance of the Corps of Engineers' Hidden Reservoir Project in the foothills of Madera County included investigations of 18 village sites, 4 campsites, and many small temporary encampments. Two periods of occupation are indicated - the earliest possibly dating back 2,000 years, and the latest extending into historic times. A report on the Corps of Engineers' Buchanan Reser- voir in Madera County was submitted to the National Park Service by Michael Moratto of San Francisco State College. Based on a survey of 65 sites, considerable antiquity - perhaps several thousand years - is sug- gested by Moratto for the occupation in the Chowchilla Valley. Also in the Buchanan Reservoir area, Thomas King and his San Francisco College field crew excavated the Schwabacher site, in which two components are suggested, the upper being protohistoric in date and probably not exceeding 700 years, and the lower dating back 2,000 to 3,000 years. Adan Treganza and Thomas King, working with the San Francisco State College Archaeological Survey, re- ported on their many years' studies in the Point Reyes National Seashore area, in which they attempted to recon- struct the various occupations of the Limantour Spit region, and the late 18th-early-19th-century Miwok- White contact at Drake's Bay. The National Park Service granted an Antiquity Act Permit to Santa Rosa Junior College for archaeological survey, excavations, and collection within the boundaries of Point Reyes National Seashore for 1968. Personnel from the Evening College at Santa Rosa, directed by Ward Upson, have worked under San Francisco State's direction since February of 1967 in the Point Reyes area. 219</page><page sequence="22">220 AMERICAN Robert Edwards, also working through San Francisco State College, used a "settlement-pattern" approach to his archaeological explorations in the Point Reyes area and succeeded in defining clearly the existence of both site clusters and site-cluster gaps, as well as in providing a correlation with Kroeber's concept of ethnographic tribelets in California. He reinventoried sites in the ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 34, No. 2, 1969 area and listed 121, including 6 which were previously unrecorded. The University of California, Los Angeles, Archaeo- logical Survey, under the supervision of Joseph L. Chart- koff, completed for the Bureau of Reclamation a field reconnaissance of 16 northern California reservoirs. WILLIAM H. OLSEN J</page></plain_text>
