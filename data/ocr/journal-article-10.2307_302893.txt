<plain_text><page sequence="1">The End of Education: "The Harvard Core Curriculum Report" and the Pedagogy of Reformation William V. Spanos Education may well be, as of right, the instrument whereby every individual, in a society like ours, can gain access to any kind of discourse. But we well know that in its distribution, in what it permits and in what it prevents, it allows the well-trodden battle- lines of social conflict. Every educational system is a political means of maintaining or of modifying the appropriation of discourse, with the knowledge and power it carries with it. Michel Foucault, "The Discourse on Language" Education is suffering from narrative sickness. Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed 1</page><page sequence="2">Enlightenment is totalitarian. Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, "The Concept of Enlightenment" The following essay constitutes a chapter from a book in pro- gress entitled The End of Education: Destroying the Core Curriculum. These all too brief prefatorial remarks are intended to provide the con- text in which I examine the rhetoric of the "Harvard Core Curriculum Report" in my text. More specifically, they are meant to situate the "Report"-and the various core curricula it has encouraged tradi- tional humanists everywhere in the academy to recuperate-in the continuum between ontology and politics where, I believe, it has to be encountered if the full significance of its apparently innocent discourse is to be understood. My text attempts to interrogate modern humanistic educa- tional theory and practice on the analogy of Martin Heidegger's De- struction of the Western philosophical tradition amplified by Michel Foucault's archeological critique of Enlightenment discourse. Briefly what Heidegger's destruction discloses is that the tradition, from Plato through Hegel to, say, Jeremy Bentham and the Age of Technology, assumes the world to be, in one way or another, fallen, a condition characterized by the dispersal of Eternity into time, identity, into difference, the One into the many, the Whole Picture into fragments or, what is the same thing, the Word (Logos) into words. This condition, therefore-this diaspora, as it were-calls for an educational process grounded in metaphysics, a perception, as the etymology of the word suggests, of things-as-they-are and their tem- poral dynamics from after or above or beyond them. It demands, in other words, a perceptual method capable of re-collecting dispersed time and the differences, the many, the words, that temporality dis- seminates into an indifferent Identity or Sameness, the One, the Word of the Origin. Such a method thus gives privileged status to the cen- tral and centering anthropomorphic eye (I) over the other, more im- mediate, senses in the pursuit of knowledge. That is, it valorizes 1) a recollective Memory that spatializes time and the rhetoric of light over interested explorative thinking and the rhetoric of darkness; 2) com- prehension (from the Latin cum, "together, in combination or union," and prehendere, "to seize," "to grasp") of what is brought to light over letting the mystery of being be; and 3) the metaphor of the centered circle over ec-centricity, de-viance, err-ancy, which, in Jacques Der- rida's terms are ex-orbitant: manifestations of abnormality. Thus Heidegger-or, rather, the Heidegger of this reading-makes explicit the essential limitation of metaphysics and of humanistic spec- ulative inquiry. Specifically, he discloses that such inquiry is ground- ed in a theoretical mode of perception (from theoria, "contemplation, 2</page><page sequence="3">speculation, sight," theoros, "spectator," and, ultimately perhaps, theos, the all-knowing and always hidden deity who looks down indif- ferently on the totality of the things themselves from the separate and distant vantage point of the sky) that, out of reach of free play, "over- looks" and, in so doing, ultimately forgets Dasein's occasion. I mean the minute particulars that time disseminates, the differences of be- ing or, to adapt Derrida to my purposes, the diff6rance, that, in in- finitely deferring presence, makes a difference to human being. Understood in this way, Heidegger's destruction of metaphysics can be seen to prefigure Michel Foucault's brilliant ar- cheological analysis of the Age of Enlightenment's "panopticism": the pervasively inscribed impulse to re-form deviants, eccentrics, idlers, invalids, etc., in the name of the normalizing anthropomorphic Logos by means of the circular geometry informing Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon-the ideal prison: We know the principle on which it was based: at the periphery, an annular building; at the center, a tower; this tower is pierced with wide windows that open onto the inner side of the ring: the peripheric building is divided into cells, each of which extends the whole width of the building; they have two windows, one on the inside, corresponding to the windows of the tower; the other, on the outside, allows the light to cross the cell from one end to the other. All that is needed, then, is to place a supervisor in a central tower and to shut up in each cell a mad man, a pa- tient, a condemned man, a worker or a schoolboy. By the effect of backlighting, one can observe from the tower, standing out precisely against the light, the small captive shadows in the cells of the periphery. They are like so many cages, so many small theatres, in which each actor is alone, perfectly individualized and instantly visible. The panoptic mechanism ar- ranges spatial unities that make it possible to see in- stantly and to recognize immediately. In short, it reverses the principle of the [medieval] dungeon; rather of its three functions-to enclose, to deprive of light and to hide-it preserves only the first and eliminates the other two. Full lighting and the eye of a supervisor capture better than darkness, which ultimately protected. Visibility is a trap.' What Foucault, in fact if not explicitly, discovers by way of his ar- cheological project in Surveiller et punir is that Bentham's Panopticon fulfills in practice the theoretical potential for power inhering in the centered circle privileged by the metaphysical tradition. He discovers, in other words, that moment in the hardening process of the tradition when the essential limitation of the Western/humanistic mode of in- 3</page><page sequence="4">quiry exposed by Heidegger's destruction comes to be used deliberately for the sake of power and the achievement of the disciplinary society. In short, when metaphysical over-sight becomes socio-political sur-veillance or super-vision: There are two images.., .of discipline. At one ex- treme the discipline-blockade, the enclosed institu- tions, established on the edges of society, turned in- wards towards negative functions: arresting evil, breaking communications, suspending time [the Panopticon]. At the other extreme, with panopticism, is the discipline-mechanism, a functional mechanism that must improve the exercise of power by making it lighter, more rapid, more effective, a design of subtle coercion for a society to come. The movement from one project to the other, from a schema of exceptional discipline to one of a generalized surveillance, rest in a historical transfor- mation: the gradual extension of the mechanisms of discipline throughout the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries, their spread throughout the whole social body, the formation of what might be called in general the disciplinary society.2 However innocently, this disciplinary meta-physical paradigm, I submit-and space permitting, analysis would make explicit- informs the "disinterested" humanistic discourse of Matthew Arnold (especially of Culture and Anarchy [1869]), the belated father of Modern humanistic education in the Anglo-American world: Now, if culture, which simply means trying to perfect oneself, and one's mind as part of oneself, brings us light, and if light shows us there is nothing so blessed in merely doing as one likes,.., .that the really blessed thing is to like what right reason or- dains, and to follow her authority, then we have got a practical benefit of culture. [This is in response to the positivist charge that Arnold's "culture" was a dilletante's evasion of the socio-political imperatives of men-in-the-world.] We have got a much wanted principle, a principle of authority, to counter-act the tendency to anarchy which seems to threaten us.3 More immediately, I suggest, this panoptic schema informs the "Har- vard" tradition, the tradition of "liberal education" from Irving Babbitt's nostalgic attempt to re-establish the supra-historical "classical" measure of man in the face of what he called the "educa- tional impressionism" unleashed by President Charles Eliot's eccen- tric "Rousseauistic" elective system (Literature and the American College, 1908): 4</page><page sequence="5">Man is a creature who is foredoomed to one- sidedness yet becomes humane only in proportion as he triumphs over this fatality of his nature, only as he arrives at that measure which comes from tempering his virtues, each by its opposite. This aim, as Mat- thew Arnold has said in the most admirable of his critical phrases, is to see life steadily and see it whole.4 to I. A. Richards' similar, if less parochial, nostalgic effort to reaffirm Plato's "comprehensive synoptic view" in the face of the knowledge explosion in the twentieth century (Speculative Instruments): The University [the repository of the "normative," the best that has been thought and said in the world] is the supreme organ for producing men and women able and fit to guide and guard it [the "just," which is also the "sane" society]: to guard it from foreign enemies (insane states) and still more from its bosom enemies, self-promoting power-seekers.... Now just what does a University do to produce such men: capable of such knowledge and thereby fit and able to govern themselves and the state? Here is the recipe. Take the cream of the school crop, the hand-picked short-list, the most talented, liveliest, young men and women, the courageous, untiring learners, and give them a long and all-important course. A course in what? Here is the course descrip- tion: "They will take the arts and sciences they have been educated in at school and put them into con- nection, in a comprehensive synoptic view of the relations with one another and with what truly is." (Republic, 537)5 Richards, it should not be forgotten, was imported by Harvard from Cambridge to help design the General Education Program of the post- World War II years, the program which, according to "The Harvard Core Curriculum Report," was "eroded" by the "proliferation of courses" during the disruptive Vietnam decade and which the "Core Curriculum" is intended to recuperate for our late time. 11 Read in the philosophical, historical, and genealogical context discovered by the destructive counter-memory-the context strategically forgotten by the Harvard faculty-the Harvard Core Cur- riculum Report is disclosed as little more than a replication-thinned out, significantly, by the consensual imperatives of academic politics-of I. A. Richards' synoptic Idea of the University and the 5</page><page sequence="6">General Education Program of the late 1940s that he was instrumen- tal in developing. In fact, Barry O'Connell makes this point in his ironically entitled essay, "Where does Harvard Lead Us?," one of the "Working Papers" of the conference on "Towards the Restoration of the Liberal Arts Curriculum" sponsored by the Rockefeller Founda- tion in September 1978: The curriculum recently adopted in Cambridge is neither original nor particularly distinguished. The Harvard "Core" is, at best, a watered-down version of the experiments in general education at Columbia in the 1920s, at Hutchins' Chicago in the 1930s, and at Harvard itself in the late 1940s [he is referring to the so-called "Redbook"-the influential report of the 1945 Harvard Committee entitled "General Educa- tion in a Free Society"].6 Although O'Connell's essay-the only one of the Working Papers of the Rockefeller Foundation that calls into question the educational value of the Harvard Core Curriculum Report--constitutes a critique of the Report's failure to review graduate along with undergraduate education and to interrogate the specialization and the departmental hegemony it perpetuates, the essay does point broadly to the elitist implications of the Report and its tendency to legitimate the existing power structure: its strategic tendency to contain and neutralize dis- sent. Thus, for example, O'Connell writes: A dispassionate observer might conclude that Har- vard has shaped the ideal curriculum for a corporate future. Its mode of design and its form of operation provide a model of bureaucracy. Like all effective bureaucracies, this one seems likely to specialize in persuading its clients that everything it does is in their best interest, while using the appearances of responsiveness to dilute and to hinder clear thinking about the ends of the institution.' and again, more tellingly: Harvard has attracted notice for its prestige, of course, but also because its new curriculum so easily can be taken as the nostrum for what ails us [read: "the proliferation of knowledge"]. Yet much more is at issue than has been acknowledged. An ex- amination which clearly formulated the deeper prob- lems in higher education would raise the questions neither the universities nor much of the society is prepared to face. I suspect it is for this reason that the media and many faculties have produced such superficial analyses and reforms.8 6</page><page sequence="7">Despite the implications of complicity with socio-political power structures, however, O'Connell's equation of the Harvard Core Cur- riculum and the old General Education Program does not generate an adequate critique of the former. For, finally, he implies that the qualitative limitations of the Core Curriculum have their source in its quantitative rather than theoretical limitations-"the reforms Harvard has adopted are not in themselves wrong. They are too little and too late"9-that, in other words, its failure is a failure of redistributing the existing pedagogic agents, rather than of interrogating their inform- ing ontology and its ideological consequences. It is not possible in this limited space to demonstrate the rela- tionship between the conservative panoptic impulse informing the Harvard Core Curriculum and that which, beginning with Irving Bab- bitt's classicist opposition to Charles W. Eliot's reforms, culminates in I. A. Richards' traditional "Synoptic View." Nor is it especially necessary or desirable. For it is not so much the curriculum as such-i.e. the quantitative distribution of core course requirements in the areas that represent the "five important modes of understanding": Letters and Arts (3 half courses); History (2); Social and Philosophical Analysis (2); Sciences and Mathematics (2); and Foreign Language and Culture (1)-that bears investigation.'0 What demands question- ing, rather, is the apparently innocent but nevertheless determining rhetoric of the report and, above all, what it insistently leaves unstated-especially about the pervasive postmodern critique of the archival language and figures (the semiotic system) of the humanistic epistm6--in the process of articulating its "Rationale." Such a de- structive reading, I suggest, discloses that, despite its avowed inten- tions to accommodate the "needs of the late twentieth century" (RCC, o.v., 2), the Report, in emphasizing the imperative to return to a core curriculum, constitutes in reality an act of nostalgia for lost origins and covertly sponsors and legitimates a subsuming theory of power. Like Arnold's and, in a more immediately filial context, like Irving Bab- bitt's and I. A. Richards' humanistic educational theories, it comes to be understood not only as an effort to recuperate an idea of the univer- sity based on the model of the panoptic centered circle which the rup- turing of the old (metaphysical) habits of thought in the last century have called into question. It also comes to be seen as an attempt to nullify the educational and socio-political manifestations of this rup- turing, especially in the United States and France, during the almost revolutionary 1960s, to which the report insistently and thus, one is compelled to conclude, deliberately omits reference. As in the case of Richards' and his predecessors' discourse, the rhetoric of the Report justifies the restoration of a core curriculum by insistent reference to the increasing dispersal of knowledge in our time. In the original report to the Harvard Faculty (February 15, 1978), this proliferation is put in terms of the "overwhelming endorsement" of the principle of non-concentration course requirements "based on the wide [Faculty] agreement that the proliferation of courses had eroded the purpose of the existing General Education Program" (p. 1). But what the Report means by the "proliferation of courses" turns out 7</page><page sequence="8">to be, in fact, the increasing cultural dispersion that threatens the alleged harmony and stability of the world-which is to say, that threatens to discredit the humanistic image of being and its ac- cumulated Archive. This is made clear in the introduction to the edited version of the Report published by the Rockefeller Foundation, which comments, by way of background, on the old program's inability to contain and domesticate (familiarize) the knowledge explosion: At mid-century, breadth was provided by requiring courses that surveyed the three main divisions of knowledge (humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences), and offered a grounding in the traditions and cultures of Western civilization. But in the last decade or more [the explosive 1960s, it should be remembered], this curriculum pattern has seemed in- adequate or inappropriate. Colleges now serve an ex- traordinary diverse body of students; knowledge has proliferated immensely and familiar lines of demar- cation have broken down; there is a growing interest in the history and problems of non-Western countries and peoples. These currents have made it increasing- ly difficult to agree upon a body of knowledge that could be considered essential to the education of undergraduates, and they have called into question the structure of the traditional liberal arts cur- riculum. (RCC, r.v., 37. My emphasis.) Nor should the disarming reference to the emergence of the disturb- ingly problematic "third world" as "a growing interest in its history and problems" invalidate this interpretation. For the rhetorical momentum generated by the first two of the series of "currents" which have destabilized the definition of the educated ("just") man and the educated ("just") society insists that the third, which osten- sibly breaks the syntactic/semantic thrust, be read as connoting a malaise-an "unrhythming," as it were-about what Richards, echo- ing Babbitt, called the "frothy emulsion of hitherto immiscible cultures," as equivalent to and perhaps determinative of the malaise implicit in the first two." And this rhetorical momentum, as we shall see, also underlies the Report's amplified rationale for including the study of "Foreign Cultures" as a core requirement. Thus, procedurally, the Harvard Faculty arrives at the begin- ning of its "inquiry" at a "standard" of the educated man "that meets the needs of the late twentieth century" or, as the Report puts it with remarkable self-satisfaction and complacency, at an answer to the question, "What does our Faculty and our university mean when we welcome a student at graduation 'to the company of educated men and women'?" (RCC, o.v., 2). And it is a standard (and answer) that constitutes nothing newer than a reaffirmation of the already ques- tionable logocentric and elitist ideal of humanistic education, the 8</page><page sequence="9">ideal, in fact, that has oriented discussion of undergraduate educa- tion at Harvard at least since the beginning of the twentieth century when Irving Babbitt attempted to introduce a (more disciplinary) ver- sion of Matthew Arnold's classical humanism to the "Rousseauistic," i.e. "barbaric," scene of American education: In his Annual Report for 1975-1976, Dean Rosovsky attempted to state what it means to be an educated person in the latter part of the twentieth century. The standard that he outlined provided the context for the review of undergraduate education at Harvard, in- cluding the development of the Core Curriculum. The elements of this standard, which broadly outline the educational goals of the college, were as follows: 1. An educated person must be able to think and write clearly and effectively. 2. An educated person should have achieved depth in some field of knowledge. Cumulative learn- ing is an effective way to develop a student's powers of reasoning and analysis, and for our under- graduates this is the principle role of concentrations. 3. An educated person should have an in- tegral appreciation of the ways in which we gain and apply knowledge and understanding of the universe, of society and of ourselves. Specifically, he or she should have an informed acquaintance with the aesthetic and intellectual experiences of literature and the arts; with history as a mode of understanding present problems and the processes of human af- fairs; with the concepts and analytical techniques of modern social science; and with the mathematical and experimental methods of the physical and technological sciences. 4. An educated person is expected to have some understanding of, and experiences in thinking about, moral and ethical problems. It may well be that the most significant quality in educated persons is the informed judgment which enables them to make discriminating moral choices. 5. Finally, an educated American, in the last third of the century, cannot be provincial in the sense of being ignorant of other cultures and other times. It is no longer possible to conduct our lives without reference to the wider world within which we live. A crucial difference between the educated and the uneducated is the extent to which one's life ex- perience is viewed in wider contexts. (CCR, r.v., 39-40) Despite the assertions that "the standard" Dean Rosovsky 9</page><page sequence="10">outlined in his Annual Report for 1975-76 "provided the context for the review of undergraduate education at Harvard," the fact is that the definition of the educated man which begins the Harvard Faculty's in- quiry is identical with the definition which brings it to a close. This cir- cularity implies, of course, that Dean Rosovsky's initial statement of the standard or center or norm is an archival point of departure, that it panoptically determined and limited the horizon of inquiry, the ques- tions, that is, which the reviewers could ask and also the possible range of answers they could deliver. In Derrida's rhetoric, the "methodology" governing this "disinterested" inquiry was characterized by "a freeplay... instituted upon a fundamental im- mobility and a reassuring certitude which is itself beyond the reach of freeplay."'12 It thus precluded the possibility of an authentic freeplay of ideas-based on the actual historical realities of the late twentieth century, on the occasion as it were. In this sense, the procedural structure of the re-view itself constitutes an exemplary instance of that vicious circularity that Heidegger and Gadamer discover to be historically endemic to the metaphysical or logocentric or panoptic mode of inquiry. For in conceiving a hermeneutic circle in which Being is ontologically prior to temporality (the Center, to the textual cir- cumference, Presence to temporality), this "methodology," for all its lip service to "disinterested inquiry," privileges a secondary or textual (archival) over a primary (phenomenological) understanding and thus conceals or alienates rather than discloses the truth of things-as- they-are.'3 It precisely enacts the mode of inquiry which the Harvard Faculty would like to impart as a "habit of thought" to its students. Read as an autonomous text, superficially and in isolation, as it is intended to be, the rhetoric of this cliche-ridden "rationale" for the Core Curriculum is disarmingly innocuous in its apparent freeplay. It is written, clearly, to achieve consensus in behalf of a generalist approach to undergraduate education from even the most recalcitrant "specialists" (intellectual "deviants" or "professionals"), who collectively, it is implied, constitute the agents of the prolifera- tion of knowledge. Read, however, in the context of the postmodern critique of the metaphysical tradition and its archival procedures and of the crisis of culture to which this critique is a response-the con- text, that is, which the Harvard Faculty incredibly overlooks-the rhetoric of the Report suggests that the idea of the university con- cealed in its omissions and its essentially quantitative terms is not simply, as Barry O'Connell observes, "anachronistic" in its failure to appreciate the centrality of new modes of understanding to our pres- ent lives,'" but essentially reactionary in its willful effort to recuperate the waning authority of the old re-collective or spatializing habits of a metaphysical mindset. For despite the Report's initial acknowledge- ment that the knowledge explosion has not only "made it increasingly difficult to agree upon a body of knowledge that could be considered essential to the education of undergraduates," but has also "called into question the structure of the traditional liberal arts curriculum,"'' the standard it posits and the accompanying commentary fail to con- 10</page><page sequence="11">front the powerful postmodern challenge to the validity of received logocentric or metaphysical epistemological assumptions. Or to put it positively, the report fails to consider the possibility, retrieved by this destructive critique, that temporality-and the differences it disseminates-is ontologically prior to Being (or Form) in the circular act of hermeneutic understanding and inquiry. Instead, it calls, not only in the archival rhetoric of executive authority ("must," "should," "is expected"), but in the careless cliches of executive authority (as well as in the habitual methodology of logocentric inquiry), for a renewed inculcation of "the knowledge, skills, and habits of thought that the [Harvard] faculty considers to be of general and lasting in- tellectual significance" (HCC, r.v., 41), which is to say, predictably, of the ability "to think and write clearly and effectively,"'6 of the "power of reasoning and analysis," of "discrimination," of "judgment," that renders one capable of grasping or comprehending, i.e. of mastering or possessing being. It is, of course, true that the Harvard Faculty alleges commitment to a "Core Curriculum based not on some theoretical division or hierarchical ordering of knowledge, but rather on 'distinctive ways of thinking that are identifiable and important' " (CRR, r.v., 38-39). As in the case of Richards and his humanistic forebears, however, the Report's definition of the educated man is in- formed by the unquestioned assumption that a single and abiding ra- tional norm or telos subsumes all the "basic modes of understanding"-whether those intrinsic to the study of literature and the arts, history, the social sciences, the physical and biological sciences, and foreign cultures-which, in the face of apparent diversi- ty, enables a synoptic view that re-presents Being. In Edward Said's phrase, it is inscribed by the "textual attitude" that (re)-as-similates (includes by same-making and discrimination or judgment) not only the differences within each mode but the difference between them; that, despite the liberal exterior, authorizes an essentially disciplinary pedagogy based on the privileged status of the "civilized" professor and the errant tendency of the "uncivilized" student; and that prom- ises, when (and if) mastered, to become for the user an efficient "speculative instrument" of power ("justice") over the devious and duplicitous "object of inquiry." In other words, the knowledge explo- sion in our time serves the Harvard Faculty simply as a point of depar- ture that justifies the recuperation of a lost absolute origin and thus, ultimately, of a disciplinary panoptic model of the college or universi- ty in which the center or core (a rational, sane, healthy, "standard") corrects or "re-forms" the ec-centric, the err-atic, the ex-orbitant, the ab-normal, or de-generate (fallen), impulse to de-viate: to stray from the right (normative) way. In thus enacting this recollective strategy, the Harvard Faculty predictably repeats the recuperative move made by Arnold, Babbitt, and Richards in the face of the "threat" of anarchy precipitated by the sudden dissemination and proliferation of knowledge they experienced in their respective generations. Indeed, I suggest, it repeats the recuperative move made by most Western reformers of educational curricula ever since Plato, and later, the 11</page><page sequence="12">authors of the New Testament inscribed the structure of the Fall into time-the Diaspora of the Logos, as it were-in the consciousness of European man. What Foucault, by way of Nietzsche, says about the enabling theogonic narrative that informs traditional historiography applies equally to the history of educational discourse which culminates in the Harvard Core Curriculum Report: The lofty origin [sought after by the traditional historian] is no more than "a metaphysical extension which arises from the belief that things are most precious and essential at the moment of birth." We tend to think that this is the moment of their greatest perfection, when they emerged dazzling from the hands of a creator or in the shadowless light of a first morning. The origin always precedes the Fall. It comes before the body, before the world and time: it is associated with the gods; and its story is always sung as a theogeny.'" Ill This logocentric narrative model is discoverable everywhere in the text of the Report. But for the sake of brevity I will consider the goals of and rationale for the core requirements in Literature and the Arts as a synecdoche for the Whole. Such a procedure is justified because, despite protestations to the contrary, the Report clearly assumes that the study of these areas (especially literature) is intrin- sically more capable than the others of "humanizing" students in an age dominated by classical scientific thinking and the new technology to which it has given rise. Thus, for example, the Report states: The common aim of these courses is to foster a critical understanding of how man gives artistic ex- pression to his experience of the world. Through the examination of selected major works, students will be expected to develop and refine skills of reading, seeing, and hearing; to apprehend the possibilities and limitations of the artist's chosen medium and the means available for expression; to understand the complex interplay between individual talent, ar- tistic tradition, and historical context. In the re- quirements for this area, the written word takes precedence over other forms of artistic expression to the extent that the study of literature is required of all students, while a choice is offered between music and fine arts. (CCR, r.v., 43. My emphasis.) 12</page><page sequence="13">This statement represents a revealing edited version of the original, which asserts that "Two further guiding principles are employed in formulating the course requirement; that the written word should take precedence over other forms of artistic expression in the sense that the study of literature is required of all students while a choice is of- fered between music and the fine arts, and that not all arts and art forms in literature, music, and the visual arts are appropriate for the Core Curriculum" (CCR, o.v., 15; my emphasis). This significant omis- sion of the italicized clause in the edited version quoted above makes explicit the Harvard Faculty's deliberately conservative exclusion not only of what might be called the "eccentric" forms of traditional ar- tistic media, but also of the new and undisciplined essentially visual, media, such as cinema and television, forms which, however variable their quality in practice, nevertheless have emerged from and address themselves to the crisis of contemporary culture to challenge the privileged status of literary expression. As Barry O'Connell ironically observes, "Visual literacy, arguably essential in a culture dominated by the visual media, is ... unattended.... Harvard's conception of the essentials of a good education in 1978 is limited to subjects most scholars in 1900 would have regarded as the core.""' Indeed, this doc- trinaire devaluation of the new visual arts in favor of the traditional "written word" is reminiscent not only of Babbitt's willfully arrogant anti-modernism, but, more specifically, of Richards' exclusive anxiety over (if not contempt for) "motion pictures, radio, television," etc., which, along with mass education and modern advertising, "expose every urbanized mind to a range and variety and promiscuity of con- tacts unparalleled in history."'9 As such, the Report repeats the reac- tion against novelty that has perennially characterized the authoritarian response of the Ancients to the experimental impulse of Modernism. The difference is that the Harvard Faculty conceals its literary elitism. More specifically, vis-J-vis the privileged literary requirements, the Report states: We assume that in dealing with such questions [in- trinsic to literary studies] students will be exposed to a variety of critical approaches, but the primary pur- pose of the Core Literature courses is to show how great authors have contrived distinctive statements about timeless and universal aspects of human ex- perience. (CCR, r.v., 44. My emphasis.) As in the other core areas, which will also focus on the study of "selected major texts," this understanding of literary study presup- poses, not simply a continuity in the history of Western Literature, but an authoritative tradition based on a dynastic model, a tradition in which, as the allusion to T. S. Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent" makes clear, "the whole of the literature of Europe from 13</page><page sequence="14">Homer and within it the whole of the literature of [a Western writer's] own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simul- taneous order."20 Further, and more importantly, the assertion that the "great authors" are those who make "distinctive statements about timeless and universal aspects of human experience" all too easily assumes that the "major texts" in this tradition are "contrived" microcosms that mirror an ultimately suprahistorical and ordered, i.e. metaphysical universe. It seems to assume, in other words, that they are characterized essentially by inherited closed forms, which, in im- itating the existential experience of man-in-the-world from the end (in both senses of the word), resolves-and levels-the discordant and disturbing differences that temporal life disseminates-the diff6rance which, in infinitely deferring presence, makes a difference -into coherent and satisfying or fulfilling wholes. In thus conceiving the "major text" to be a spatialized image, the Report also seems to assume that its essential function is to distance the reader aesthet- ically from his ambiguous immediate experience, to purge him (as Aristotle initially put it) of his dislocating pity and terror, the anxiety that immediate being-in-the-world activates. As in Arnold and Babbitt and Richards, that is, the Report assumes that the "Masterpieces" of the tradition constitute textual re-presentations of the dispersed logos and thus artistic reflections (microcosms) of the logocen- tric-and, as Keats said of Wordsworth's poetic certainty, "egotistically sublime"-humanistic interpretation of being (the macrocosm). The texts that do not obviously conform to the received spatialized decorum of the "masterpiece" are (implicitly) coerced into the spatial mold and the geometric curve of its history (and their disruptive force neutralized) by over-looking and/or excusing the for- mal ec-centricities they enact. I am, of course, referring to such essen- tially marginal, openended, and dislocating works as, say, Cervante's Don Quixote, the narrative errancy of which disrupts the interwoven shape of the circuitous journey of the questing knight of medieval romance and the inclusive "reality" this Golden Age journey would recuperate even by rationalizing discontinuity in the last resort figure of the enchanter; Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy, the infinitely regressive movement of which disrupts the authoritative dynastic plot of Fielding's Tom Jones and the monolithic Deistic macrocosm that informs its utterly determined "accidents;" and Herman Melville's Moby Dick, the de-vious narrative of which precipitates an "or- phanage" that disrupts the assured patriarchal Adamic structure of American Renaissance literature to disclose the absence at the heart of the centered circle informing the gravely pantheistic "central man" of New England transcendentalism, thus calling into question the monomaniacal will to power over being this anthropomorphism authorizes: So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the half-spent suction of the 14</page><page sequence="15">sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital cen- tre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the cof- fin lifebuoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on the soft and dirge-like main.... On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan.21 Or, as in the case of postmodern novels which disrupt both traditional and Modernist closure-texts such as Thomas Pynchon's V., John Barth's Lost in the Funhouse, or Donald Barthelme's The Dead Father, and poems like Ezra Pound's Cantos, William Carlos Williams' Pater- son, Charles Olson's Maximus Poems, Robert Creeley's A Day Book, or Edward Dorn's Gunslinger-they are "excluded" from the canon. Just as the madman becomes a measure of sanity in the civilized Enlightenment, according to Foucault, these postmodern texts become exemplary instances of what the New Critics called "the fallacy of imitative form," i.e. of what the Western "masterpiece"- the text in which a "master" masters his recalcitrant materials-is not. In fact, nothing in the Report would suggest that this powerful and disconcerting "eccentric" literature of the counter-memory is worthy of serious study by Harvard undergraduates. Somewhat like Matthew Arnold's and Irving Babbitt's disciplinary uneasiness about including contemporary literature in the liberal arts curriculum, and, more immediately, like Lionel Trilling's celebrated reservations-to put the best interpretation on them-about teaching such disturbing Moderns as Dostoevsky, Kafka, Mann, Nietzsche, Freud, etc., to inno- cent Columbia undergraduates,22 the Report's conspicuous silence in the face of a literature intended to retrieve the integrity of difference and ultimately the question of being from the assimilative con- sciousness represents a failure of nerve, a refusal to confront what Derrida might call these works' disorienting "force"23 and Foucault their discordant "monstrosity."24 This failure of nerve in the face of otherness, I would suggest, also lies behind the Report's exclusion from the Core Curriculum of those artistic works, both of the past and present, which do not utilize the received "medium and means available for expression."25 Nor should the emphasis given by the Core Curriculum to "in- terdisciplinary study" (CRR, o.v., 17) to counteract the prevailing 15</page><page sequence="16">disciplinary character of specialized literary/artistic education, be taken, as it is apparently intended, to imply a recognition of and com- mitment to the cultural differences that the postmodern con- sciousness has discovered and insists on generously exploring, whatever the risks. For inscribed in the Core Curriculum's rationale for such interdisciplinary courses in the arts, including those that "will [also] encourage enterprise on the part of faculty members, some of whom may wish to join together in a single offering" (CCR, o.v., 17), is, as it has been since Plato, the mystified synoptic model of the assimilative imagination. The goal of interdisciplinary study, in other words, is not what, for example, Henry Adams-a Harvard dropout-would have wished, the achievement of respect for radical difference: For himself he was clear that the fault lay in the system, which would lead only to inertia [read "indif- ferent or motionless motion"]. Such little knowledge of himself as he possessed warranted him in affirm- ing that his mind required conflict, competition, con- tradiction even more than that of the student. He too wanted a rank-list to set his name upon. His reform of the system would have begun in the lecture room at his own desk. He would have seated a rival assis- tant professor opposite him, whose business should be strictly limited to expressing opposite views. Nothing short of this would ever interest either the professor or the student: but of all university freaks, no irregularity shocked the intellectual atmosphere so much as contradiction or competition between teachers. In that respect the thirteenth-century university system was worth the whole teaching of the modern school. All his pretty efforts to create conflicts of thought among his student failed for want of system [by which he means an environment sympathetic to his de-centered stance]. None met the needs of in- struction. In spite of President Eliot's reforms and his steady, generous, liberal support, the system re- mained costly, clumsy and futile. The university-as far as it was represented by Henry Adams-pro- duced at great waste of time and money results not worth reaching.... The uses of adversity are beyond measure strange. As a professor, he regarded himself as a failure [a failure measured, of course, in terms of the privileged "system," in which Adams' colleagues "knew what they had to teach whereas 'he did not' "]. Without false modesty he thought he knew what he meant. He had tried a great many experiments, and 16</page><page sequence="17">wholly succeeded in none. He had succumbed to the weight of the system. He had accomplished nothing that he tried to do. He regarded the system as wrong; more mischievous to the teachers than to the students: fallacious from the beginning to end. He quitted the university at last, in 1877.....6 Rather than engagement with radical "conflict, competition, con- tradiction"-i.e. the diversity that, according to Henry Adams, animates the mind-the goal of interdisciplinary study envisaged by the Harvard Core Curriculum Report is, as it was for Adams' genera- tion, insistently the comprehension of normative sameness, the obsessive and unrelenting pursuit of which, as Adams-and his postmodern heir, Thomas Pynchon-knew, ends in the "excluded middle" and the inertia of in-difference.27 The aim of these interdisciplinary courses is not only to show the connection between the arts and literature, and between both and their social and historical contexts (CCR, o.v., 17), but also to bring to light the "shared assumptions" (CCR, o.v., 18) and "shared characteristics" (CCR, o.f., 18) of the various artistic expressions of a period and, by extension, of Western culture at large: Some courses may wish to study aspects of a specific stylistic movement such as Neoclassicism, Romanticism, or Impressionism. A course, for exam- ple, in Romanticism might wish to concentrate on a very few works and examine in detail the elements that go into a painting by Gericault, a building by Pugin, a composition by Berlioz, and a poem by Byron, considering the assumptions they share as well as placing them in their historical and social contexts. (CCR, o.v., 18) As virtually all humanistic interdisciplinary education has assumed in the past (and despite recent interrogations of such a hermeneutic pro- cedure), the Report assumes that the various artistic expressions, both within a "period" in Western history and within Western history at large, constitute moments of a single, continuous, and assimilatable whole, in which all "events" are deposited and definitively "placed" (i.e. a fixed and unchanging Object of study); that behind this apparent diversity of artistic works there lies the ever- present idea of a (privileged) Western culture that determines their essential character. As such, it also implies an interdisciplinary pedagogy that begins from the vantage point of an already defined or Named and thus authoritative and authorizing dynastic model, which panoptically supervises the process of inquiry: the expectations and the results of the students' encounter with unique manifestations, the minute particulars, as it were. In short, it implies an interdisciplinary pedagogy which is viciously circular-and enervating. Thus, as in the 17</page><page sequence="18">case of the Core Curriculum's understanding of literary study as such, and despite "the many ways in which these courses may be organ- ized" (CCR, o.v., 17), an unpacking of its misleading emphasis on the interdisciplinary study of the arts at large reveals that such a program remains fundamentally disciplinary. These "interdisciplinary courses," the Report concludes, "will enable students to apply the skills of critical appreciation" in the study of literature (CCR, o.v., 17). Their object, finally, is not to activate explorative inquiry that leads to self-understanding, but to inculcate a way of thinking that confirms received knowledge (the Archive), not the quest for truth as an on- going phenomenological a-letheia (bringing out of concealment, dis- covering, what archival procedures hide or cover over, remembering what recollection forgets), but, as the Latinate Harvard motto has it, the reaffirmation of Veritas, Truth, that is, as adequaetio intellectus et rei. 28 In its effort to recuperate the Tradition, in other words, the "Harvard Faculty's" archival understanding of the function and goal of undergraduate study of Literature and the Arts hedges if it does not ignore the insistent testimony of the dynamic, indeed, revolutionary de-structive project of avant-garde literature and hermeneutic/critical thinking in our time: its radical interrogation of the privileged concept of "the central man" (so fundamental, since Emerson, to the Harvard tradition), of the language and signs of signification, of authorship, of endings in thinking about beginnings, of logocentric or teleological forms, of dynastic historical models, of the mystified archival network of tropes-metaphors, figures, myths-and syntactic constructions that express, reproduce, and legitimate these grounds of the tradition, and of the expanding neo-capitalist economy which exploits these privileged cultural paradigms for its hegemonic ends. Similarly, this recuperative effort theoretically precludes or at least minimizes the witness of de-structive philosophic, historiographic, social scientific, and even scientific thought of the postmodern scene. Space does not permit an exhaustive examination of the Report's rationale for the study of each of these other "major areas of knowledge" included in the Core Curriculum. Nevertheless, even a sampling of references to the process of understanding taken at random from its appallingly domesticated concensus rhetoric should suggest how insistently the Harvard Faculty's appeal in each case is to the privileged and enabling categories of metaphysical epistemology. Thus despite the lip service it pays to the "distinctness" of these areas of knowledge and the differences be- tween the respective modes of understanding they imply, the Report insistently refers to "central texts," "central concepts," "core ap- proaches," "disciplinary approaches," "disinterested" or "impartial inquiry," "historical continuity," "analysis," "analytic skills," "critical appreciation," "judgment," "discrimination," "universal explanations of diverse phenomena," "skills necessary" to "attack problems," "systematic thinking," "moral reasoning." What I am suggesting, in other words, is that a fuller examination would disclose that the 18</page><page sequence="19">rhetoric of the rationale for these areas of core study, like that for the study of literature and the arts, whether disciplinary or inter- disciplinary, is inscribed by a metaphysical or synoptic mode of understanding that assimilates and levels their distinctness or dif- ferences. In effect, it disenfranchizes content-the de-structive dynamics of worldly desire-by taking it up into and enclosing it within the completed structure of Form. IV The one aspect of the Harvard Core Curriculum Report that suggests a real departure from the old logocentric model of humanistic undergraduate education-a departure that appears to call into question the privileged status of the encompassing Western epistemological socio-political perspective-is, of course, the addi- tion of "Foreign Cultures" to the three main divisions of knowledge of the traditional liberal arts core curriculum. But even this inclusion, ostensibly intended to acknowledge the emergence "in the last decades or more" of the insistent (desiring) voices of Third World peoples, should not be taken too hastily as a radical break with the Synoptic View of I. A. Richards and the Harvard General Education Program of the 1940s that overcomes its privileged ethnocentrism. Certainly the report insists on the special importance of this area for Americans "living in the last third of this century": A Foreign Languages and Cultures requirement in the proposed core is specifically designed to expand the student's range of cultural experience and to pro- vide fresh perspectives on his or her own cultural assumptions and traditions.... The intention here is not merely to avoid an exclusive focus on Western tradition, but to expose students to the essential and distinctive features of major alien cultures, whether Western or non-Western. (CCR, o.v., 4; see also pp. 27-28.) Framed as it is, however, by a justification that reduces the militant anti-imperialistic praxis of formerly colonial peoples to "a growing in- terest in [their] history and problems," this rationale is hardly ade- quate to meet the demands of the postmodern (or post-Imperialist) age for understanding cultures, especially of the so-called Third World, which have assumed momentous global economic, political, and social importance by way of their emergent consciousness of and concerted action against the perennial Western Imperialistic exploita- tion. Nor, in an equally decisive way, is it adequate to the radical ques- tioning of Western archival discourse about non-Western cultures by such critics as Franz Fanon, Jean-Paul Sartre, Regis Debray, Paulo Freire, Edward Said, etc. It is not only that the one semester course re- 19</page><page sequence="20">quired by the Core Curriculum-nor that this requirement can be ful- filled by taking it in a "major culture of the West" (CCR, o.v., 29)-is "simply insufficient,''29 though the woefully deficient and weak ac- commodation is symptomatic of a lack of authentic commitment to activating a real dialogue with non-Western cultures that acknowledges and respects difference-the real lives of the people who comprise the cultures and the real historical events that render their cultures a changing process. It is also, and primarily, this ra- tionale's remarkable failure to provide a context recognizing and acknowledging that the traditional discourse of the West concerning the Third World-whether about the peoples of Africa, the Orient, or Latin America-has been a self-perpetuating discourse based, not on actuality, but on the ethnocentric perspective of Western archival knowledge of the Third World. As Edward Said has persuasively shown in his analysis of Western discourse about the Orient, this authoritative archival discourse about the Third World has gone hand in glove with-indeed, as in the paradigmatic case of Napoleon's Egyptian expedition, has led the way for-its imperialistic ex- ploitation: My idea is that European and then American interest in the Orient was political according to some of the obvious historical accounts of it..., but that it was the culture that created that interest, that acted dynamically along with brute political, economic, and military rationales to make the Orient the varied and complicated place that it obviously was in the field that I call Orientalism.... Orientalism is not a mere political subject matter or field that is reflected passively by culture, scholarship, or institutions; nor is it a large and diffuse collection of texts about the Orient; nor is it representative and expressive of some infamous "Western" imperialist plot to hold down the "Oriental" world. It is rather a distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic, scholarly, economic, sociological, historical, and philosophical texts; it is an elaboration not only of a basic geographical distinction (the world is made up of two unequal halves, Orient and Occident) but also of a whole series of "interests" which, by such means as scholarly discovery, philological reconstruction, psychological analysis, landscape and sociological description, it not only creates but also maintains; it is, rather than expresses, a certain will or intention to understand, in some cases to control, manipulate, even to incorporate, what is a manifestly different (or alternative and novel) world; it is, above all, a discourse that is by no means in direct, correspond- ing relationship with political power in the raw, but 20</page><page sequence="21">rather is produced and exists in an uneven exchange with various kinds of power, shaped to a degree by the exchange with power political (as with a colonial or imperial establishment), power intellectual (as with reigning sciences like comparative linguistics or anatomy, or any of the modern policy sciences), power cultural (as with orthodoxies and canons of taste, texts, values), power moral (as with ideas about what "we" do and what "they" cannot do or understand as "we" do). Indeed my real argument is that Orientalism is-and does not simply represent -a considerable dimension of modern political- intellectual culture, and as such has less to do with the Orient than it does with "our" world.30 Indeed, along with the obvious inadequacy of the quantitative requirements and the overwhelming emphasis given to the self- confirming study of the Western tradition, this failure to provide the historical context and to acknowledge the perennial affiliation of humanistic archival education and knowledge and Western political and economic exploitation of the non-Western world strongly suggest that, at best, the inclusion of the study of Foreign Cultures is, as has been the traditional response of the Western university to disruptive cultural change, little more than a token accommodation-a conces- sion, in fact-forced by the de-centering imperatives of historical cir- cumstance, the contemporary occasion, as it were. At worst, this tell- ing silence suggests that, however innocently, the inclusion of a Foreign Cultures requirement is a gesture of accommodation in the context of Vietnam, Latin America and the Middle East, similar to that re-centering strategy disclosed by Edward Said in his analysis of the co-optive "reconsiderations"-what I would call the "re-visionary" discourse-concerning the educational and political goals of Western Oriental studies by such academically and politically influen- tial "post-imperialistic" Orientalists as Sylvain Levi, Louis Massignon, and Sir Hamilton Gibb. What, for example, Said says of the early modern humanistic reformulations of Western educational attitudes towards the Orient by Silvain Levi (Professor of Sanskrit at the Coll6ge de France and President of the Societe asiatique between 1928 and 1935)-which, despite the changed historical cir- cumstances, is the essential inference to be drawn from Massignon's and especially Gibb's Oriental discourse--parallels in a remarkably revealing way the re-centering and co-optive goal behind the Harvard Faculty's introduction of "Foreign" or "non-Western cultures" to the undergraduate Core Curriculum. The passage from Said, which in- cludes L6vi's illuminating (and prophetic) confrontation of the emergent "East-West problem," deserves extended quotation for the way it undermines the apparent departure from the ethnocentrism of earlier versions of humanistic education at Harvard such as those of Irving Babbitt and I. A. Richards: 21</page><page sequence="22">In the period between the wars, as we can easily judge from, say, Malraux's novels, the relations be- tween East and West assumed a currency that was both widespread and anxious.... The Orient now ap- peared to constitute a challenge, not just to the West in general, but to the West's spirit, knowledge, and imperium.... Such issues forced reconsideration of Western knowledge of the Orient. No less a per- sonage than Sylvain L6vi ... reflected seriously in 1925 on the urgency of the East-West problem: ... If because of laziness or incomprehension Europe does not make the effort that its in- terests alone require from it, then the Asiatic drama will approach the crisis point. It is here that that science which is a form of life and an instrument of policy-that is, wherever our interests are at stake-owes it to itself to penetrate native civilization and life in their intimacy in order to discover their fun- damental values and durable characteristics rather than to smother native life with the in- coherent threat of European civilizational im- ports. We must offer ourselves to these civiliza- tions as we do our products, that is, on the local exchange market. Levi has no difficulty in connecting Orientalism with politics, for the long-or rather, the prolonged- Western intervention in the East cannot be denied either in its consequences for knowledge or in its ef- fect upon the hapless native; together the two add up to what could be a menacing future. For all his ex- pressed humanism, his admirable concern for fellow creatures, Levi conceives the present juncture in unpleasantly constricted terms. The Oriental is im- agined to feel his world threatened by a superior civilization; yet his motives are impelled, not by some positive desire for freedom, political independence, a cultural achievement on their own terms, but instead by rancor, a jealous malice. The panacea offered for this potentially ugly turn of affairs is that the Orient be marketed for a Western consumer, be put before him as one among numerous wares beseeching his attention. By a single stroke you will defuse the Orient (by letting it think itself to be an "equal" quan- tity on the Occidental marketplace of ideas), and you will appease Western fears of an Oriental tidal wave. 22</page><page sequence="23">At bottom, of course, Levi's principal point-and his most telling confession-is that unless something is done about the Orient, "the Asiatic drama will ap- proach the crisis point."3' Given the Core Curriculum's inordinate emphasis on the transmission of the humanistic discourse and its related failure to acknowledge the increasing interrogation of the aggressive ethnocen- trism of traditional humanistic education, especially since the Enlightenment, it is hard to conclude otherwise than that the Harvard Faculty's conception of the common purpose of the Core courses in the Foreign Cultures area-as the provision of "fresh perspectives on the student's own cultural assumptions and traditions"--is, in fact, a tacit replication or an updated supplement of the in-clusive synoptic perspective and co-optive goals that inform I. A. Richards' peda- gogical enterprise as it relates to "immiscible" and "unrhythming" non-Western Cultures: ... two-thirds of us on this planet are, at the time of writing, analphabetics. Of the 2,200,000,000 people now breathing, some 1,500,000,000 either cannot read at all or read some non-alphabetic script. This is no time or place in which to argue the merits of the invention of alphabetic writing. Suffice it that if there is to be any truly worldwide communication between peoples within a foreseeable future, it will be in some language which is alphabetic. It could be within our lifetime and through English.32 Like Richards-and, it should not be forgotten, the Harvard brain trust that was largely responsible for American foreign policy in Southeast Asia in the 1960s-the authors of the Core Curriculum Report con- tinue to conceive of non-Western societies as ultimately "immiscible" and "unrhythming" cultures, which, nevertheless, must be seduced if not forcefully incorporated, into the cultural orbit of the Western logos. Like Richards, too, they also continue apparently to understand the goal of cross-cultural education as making the epistemological in- strument and its rhetoric of exclusive in-clusion more flexible or "ex- pansive" and thus less overtly but no less really coercive than the more violent instruments of the imperialistic dispensation. V The fourth "element" of the Harvard Faculty's definition of an "educated person," we recall, has to do with morality and ethics: An educated person is expected to have some 23</page><page sequence="24">understanding of, and about, experience in thinking about moral and ethical problems. It may well be that the most significant quality in educated persons is the informed judgment which enables them to make discriminating moral choices. This way of putting it appears to be innocuous enough. Understood in the context of the hidden (unsaid) logocentrism that informs virtually every explicit proposal of the Harvard Core Curriculum Report, however, this disarmingly familiar humanistic rhetoric decodes itself to disclose a significantly different imperative. In thus reducing the question of ethics-which is essentially ontological-to "philosophical" problems, the Core Curriculum calls, not for the ac- tivation of a moral or ethical consciousness per se. As its insistence on an enabling "informed judgment" suggests, it calls, rather, for the inculcation of a discriminatory, publically authorized, moral norm grounded in the hidden logos as ratio. Despite the humanistic claim to disinterested inquiry, such a norm is, like the guardian in Bentham's Panopticon, out of reach of free play. As such, it becomes a privileged deontologized standard that levels the moral and ethical complexities of a de-centered ambience to conceptual and socially manageable status. As Heidegger says in recalling the fate of thought at the hands of the "school of Plato," it becomes an archival imperative that negates thinking-and dwelling in the nearness of being-in behalf of a disciplinary manipulation of things-as-they-are: Along with "logic" and "physics," "ethics" appeared for the first time in the school of Plato. These disciplines arose at a time when thinking was becoming "philosophy," philosophy, episteme (science), and science itself a matter for schools and academic pursuits. In the course of a philosophy so understood, science waxed and thinking (Denken) waned. Thinkers prior to this period knew neither a "logic" nor an "ethics" nor "physics." Yet their think- ing was neither illogical nor immoral. But they did think physics in a depth and breadth that no subse- quent "physics" was ever again to attain. The tragedies of Sophocles--provided such a com- parison is at all permissable--preserve the ethos in their sagas more primordially than Aristotle's lec- tures on "ethics.""33 Despite its explicit sponsorship of a curriculum that envisions the development of a liberal ethical consciousness, what the Core Cur- riculum calls for, finally, is the renewed standardization of the an- thropocentric idea of man as measure, that is, of the measure of man as will to power. Thus, far from providing a philosophy of education and a cur- 24</page><page sequence="25">riculum capable of preparing the young (including the perennially ex- cluded minorities and the increasing number of the middle-aged and the old seeking re-education) to encounter meaningfully the complex de-centered realities of the late twentieth century, the Harvard Facul- ty offers one designed, however inadvertantly, to prepare men and women for a world that, having been called into question not only by the contemporary liberal arts but also by history itself, has, in fact as well as in theory, come to its end. Like Arnold's and Babbitt's and Richards'-not to say F. R. Leavis' and Lionel Trilling's34--humanistic alternatives to classical science and technology, it finally posits a mode of general education that, in the name of "full self-development" (CCR, o.v., 6) and generosity, reproduces, extends, and enforces rather than disrupts and diminishes the power of the very dehumanizing agencies of the modern world it ostensibly seeks to humanize. Such an educational program is ultimately implicated in the interested effort to recuperate the dissolving humanistic discourse, and, thus, like Plato's "synoptic view" or Bentham's "Panopticism" or Richards' "spec-ulative instrument" (albeit in a less obtrusively aggressive way), to render students (de-viants) docile, will- ing and useful agents of a levelling abstract power that governs America, indeed, the Western World, and insistently seeks hegemony over the entire planet on the authority of the humanistic logos. This program would make students obedient servants of the polis, if they attend public institutions of higher learning; servants who believe they are masters of this self-replicating disciplinary polis, if they at- tend prestigious, privately-endowed institutions like Harvard. Ontologically, such an educational program is implicated in the perennial panoptic effort of Western man to perpetuate his will to power over being-the will to power that has not only alienated being, but, as the increasing evidence of ecological imbalance suggests, transformed its energies into a retaliatory, indeed, demonic, force. To appropriate Nietzsche by way of Heidegger's understanding of the always renewing "strife between world and earth,"35 the educational program described in the Harvard Core Curriculum Report derives from and propagates an obsessive and partial Apollonian impulse to bring the obscurity of being to light-to world the earth and thus to obliterate the rift between them that makes a difference-an impulse which, because it legitimates exploitation at every site on the con- tinuum of being, from language to human society, threatens to engulf the world in an equally virulent and partial darkness. The excluded testimony not only of the postmodern philosopher but also of the postmodern poet-Charles Olson, for ex- ample-bears witness to this "end" of humanistic education: If man chooses to treat external reality any different- ly than as a part of his own process, in other words as anything other than relevant to his own inner life, then he will (being such a forward thing, and bound to use his energy willy-nilly, nature is so subtle) use it 25</page><page sequence="26">otherwise. He will use it just exactly as he has used it now for too long, for arbitrary purposes which, in their effects, not only change the face of nature but actually arrest and divert her force until man turns it even against herself, he is so powerful, this little thing. [The allusion, of course, is to the negative con- sequences of Odysseus's exultant "triumph," by way of his will to power, over Polyphemus, the monstrous offspring of Poseidon, the "God" of the sea of being.] But what little willful modern man will not recognize is, that when he turns it against her he turns it against himself....36 But this destructive testimony of the postmodern imagination is projective as well as critical. For it also points to the retrieval of the original question of being-the question forgotten by Western man- as a way of "overcoming" the inclusive and disastrous end which threatens things all along the continuum of being. As Heidegger puts this retrieval: To ask "how does it stand with being?" means nothing less than to recapture, to repeat [Weider- holen], the beginning of our historical-spiritual ex- istence in order to transform it into a new beginning. This is possible. It is indeed the crucial form of history, because it begins in the fundamental event. But we do not repeat a beginning by reducing it to something past or now known, which need merely be initiated; no, the beginning must be begun again, more radically, with all the strangeness, darkness, in- security that attend a true beginning. Repetition as we understand it is anything but an improved con- tinuation with the old methods of what has been up to now.37 To put it another way, the destructive testimony of the postmodern counter-memory also points to the retrieval of the "errant" thinking of man-in-the-world, a kind of thinking that allows the always already dis-integrating strife between the worlding world and the mysterious earth to go on. This thinking is not the willful calculative thought of an ossified humanism, whose measure is the exact and exacting geometry of the panoptic eye and whose purpose it is to recuperate the formal order of that time (in illo tempore). It is, rather, a negatively capable thinking, the measure of which, to adapt the phrase Robert Creeley uses to characterize the poetry of the postmodern imagina- tion, is the generous horizonal "measure of man's occasion" and whose purpose it is to let being be. In other words, its measure is, as the etymology suggests,38 the an-archic or ec-centric and thus dis- orienting measure, not of eternal man, but of mortal men or, rather, of human dwelling on this earth, in this time, in this place: dia-spora. In 26</page><page sequence="27">an essay on the relationship between poetry and thinking, which could be read as a response to Babbitt's, Richards', and the Harvard Faculty's centric and regulative en mesure, Heidegger says: To write poetry is measure-taking, understood in the strict sense of the word by which man first recovers the measure for the breadth of his being. Man exists as mortal. He is called mortal because he can die. To be able to die means: to be capable of death as death. Only man dies-and indeed continually, as long as he stays on this earth, as long as he dwells. His dwelling, however, rests in the poetic. Holderin sees the nature of the "poetic" as the taking of the measure by which the measure-taking of human be- ing is accomplished. A strange measure for ordinary and in par- ticular also for all merely scientific ideas, certainly not a palpable stick or rod but in truth simpler to han- dle, provided our hands do not abruptly grasp but are guided by gestures befitting the measure here to be taken. This is done by a taking which at no time clutches at the standard but rather takes it in a con- centrated perception, a gathering taking-in, that re- mains a listening.39 What an occasional measure implies about a specific educa- tional program is beyond the scope of these remarks. But this does not render its explicit introduction to the discussion at this late stage gratuitous. In disclosing the humanistic idea of Man-i.e. Man as measure (of all things)-to be a Will to Power over being and in calling for the retrieval of an originary measure of man "grounded" in his oc- casion, the postmodern witness also discloses that the question of being (or, rather, the be-ing of being) is essentially prior to the Form that the educational process assumes. Or to put it another way, the failure to ask the ontological question is to perpetuate the repetition of the Same: that recurrent and predictable impulse to level the dif- ferences that temporality disseminates-the differences that make a difference-into indifference. Which is to say, with Heidegger and Pynchon, postmodern philosopher and postmodern novelist, that the refusal of the Seinsfrage give impetus to the exhaustion of being all along its continuum, from language to society, i.e. to the entropic process. I am, of course, fully aware of the great distance between, on the one hand, the low-keyed practical context of the issues that the Harvard Faculty addresses in the Report, and, on the other, the crisis context I have chosen as the site of my response to what it concludes about them. As I have been suggesting, however, this should not be in- terpreted as either an exaggeration of the importance of the Harvard Core Curriculum Report or as an escape valve. On the contrary, the ap- palling distance between the context (and rhetoric) of the Harvard 27</page><page sequence="28">Faculty's deliberations (and of the actual situation of higher educa- tion in America that these deliberations reflect) and the ontological, cultural and socio-political crisis our troubled planet is undergoing constitutes a telling measure of permissable knowledge, the extent, that is, of the hegemony of the semiotic network that serves modern power and authority. It also constitutes a measure of the intensity of the crisis of Western man. To address the questions of higher educa- tion at this time in an exhausted language that in the name of "that time" leaves the crucial problematics of the distance unsaid, as the Harvard Report does, is to be guilty not simply of nostalgia but of an indifferent-a care-less-and dangerous panoptic monologue: ir- responsibility to the community of students, to the polis, and ultimately, to being itself, which it is the essential responsibility of education in this time not only to protect by interrogating, by bearing witness against power, but to occasion. "For questioning," as Heidegger says, "is the piety of thought."40 VI The only other object of note in Erskine's room was a picture, hanging on the wall, from a nail. A circle, obviously described by a compass, and broken at its lowest point, occupied the middle foreground, of this picture. Was it receding? Watt had that impression. In the eastern background ap- peared a point, or dot. The point was blue, but blue! The rest was white. How the effect of perspective was obtained Watt did not know. But it was obtained. By what means the illusion of movement in space, and it almost seemed in time, was given, Watt could not say. But it was given. Watt wondered how long it would be before the point and circle entered together upon the same plane. Or had they not done so already, or almost? And was it not rather the circle that was in the background, and the point that was in the foreground? Watt wondered if they had sighted each other, or were blindly flying thus, harried by some force of merely mechanical mutual attraction, or the playthings of chance. He wondered if they would eventually pause and converse, and perhaps even mingle, or keep steadfast in their ways, like ships in the night, prior to the invention of wireless telegraphy. Who knows, they might even collide. And he wondered what the artist had intended to repre- sent (Watt knew nothing about painting), a circle and its centre in search of each other, or a circle and its centre in search of a centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and its centre in search of its centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and its centre in search 28</page><page sequence="29">of a centre and its circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of its centre and its circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of a centre and a circle respectively.... Samuel Beckett, Watt ... There is no centre, but always decenterings, series that register the halting passage from presence to absence, from excess to deficiency. The circle must be abandoned as a faulty principle of return....

In the English translation, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, tr. Alan Sheridan (New York: Pantheon Books, 1977), from which I am quoting (p. 200), the title obscures the crucial relationship between visual perception and power and thus diverts the reader from making the connection between the metaphysical tradition (and the educational institutions to which it has given rise) and socio-political power; i.e. Foucault's kinship with Heideg- ger and even Sartre. 2 Discipline and Punish, p. 209. 3 Matthew Arnold, "Doing as One Likes," Culture and Anarchy (New York: Mac- millan, 1925), p. 79. 4 Irving Babbitt, Literature and the American College: Essays in the Defense of the Humanities (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1908), p. 23. 5 1.

The same point, though from a highly favorable perspective, is also made by Alston Chase in "Skipping Through Col- lege: Reflections on the Decline of Liberal Arts Education," Toward the Restoration of the Liberal Arts Curriculum: "Thirty-three years ago a prestigious Harvard Committee issued a report defining and supporting the concept of a liberal (general) education (the famed 'Redbook'). This report was highly influential. After it was issued, Harvard established its now well-known system of general education, and most of the rest of the community of higher education followed suit. Last March another prestigious Harvard committee, under the direction of Dean Henry Rosovsky, issued a report containing virtual- 29</page><page sequence="30">ly the same message," p. 82. Both O'Connell and Chase could have added Irv- ing Babbitt's program at the beginning of the century to suggest the continuing conservatism of Harvard educational theory and practice. 7 O'Connell, "Where Does Harvard Lead Us?," p. 61. 8 "Where Does Harvard Lead Us?," p. 63. 9 "Where Does Harvard Lead Us?," pp. 68-69. 10 "Report on the Core Curriculum" (original version, published on February 15, 1978, by Dean Henry Rosovsky for distribution "to members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and other members of the Harvard Community"). A slightly edited report which "incorporates modifications called for in the faculty legislation was published as one of the "Working Papers" of the Rockefeller Foundation Conference on Toward the Restoration of the Liberal Arts Cur- riculum. In the following, I will make use of both texts, indicating reference to the first as RCC, o.v., and the second as RCC, r.v. These, with page numbers, will be incorporated in the text in parentheses. 11 I. A. Richards, "Responsibilities in the Teaching of English," Speculative In- struments: "Possibly, even probably, the difficulties of reading justly are in- creasing. Within a well-defined tradition the items and the patterns they enter are fewer and clearer than amid the frothy emulsions of hitherto immiscible cultures in which to-day we live and move and aspire to win some being. Our novel acquaintanceship with the untraditional past and with the oddities of thought and feeling from other cultures is unrhythming, it may be, the heart of our mental and moral security" (p. 101; my emphasis). Also see Irving Babbitt, Literature and the American College, in which Babbitt attributes the dangerous "centrifugal" momentum of modern life to the Romanticists' development of the historical method, "which has proved so powerful a solvent of both Chris- tian and classical dogma" (p. 185), and to their inordinate "study of origins," which led to the discovery of the strange and virtually immiscible languages and cultures of the Far East and thus of the "means of undermining the classical orthodoxy" (p. 190-201). 12 Jacques Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," Writing and Difference, tr. Alan Bass (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1978), p. 248. 13 See especially Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, tr. John Macquarrie and Ed- ward Robinson (New York: Harper and Row, 1962), pp. 362-63, and Hans-Georg Gadamer, Truth and Method, tr. edited by Garret Barden and John Cumming (New York: The Seabury Press, 1975), pp. 235 ff.

William V. Spanos (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1979), pp. 115-48. 14 Barry O'Connell, "Where Does Harvard Lead Us?," p. 64. 15 The essential difference between the distribution requirements of the Old General Education Program of the 1940s and the "new" Core Curriculum lies simply in the addition of History and Foreign Cultures to the original areas (humanities, social sciences, and natural science), or rather, in the redistribu- tion of the latter into five areas. 16 Although the Report emphasizes the restoration of the writing requirement to the undergraduate curriculum, the language of this emphasis is consistently the same as in the quoted phrase. For example, the expository writing require- ment it intended "to improve the ability of the student to write effectively, con- cisely, clearly" (HCC, o.v., 31); and again, "the first goal, that our students learn 30</page><page sequence="31">to communicate with precision, cogency and force, is addressed by the require- ment in Expository Writing and reinforced throughout the curriculum" (HCC, r.v., 40). The Report, that is, fails to indicate even the slightest awareness that the old humanistic ideals of "clarity" and "effectiveness" and "conciseness" -which the underground Man in Doestoevsky's Notes from Underground would call the "straightforward language" of the "straightforward Gentlemen" (the builders of the Crystal Palace) he is addressing-have been called radical- ly into question both directly by such critics as Richard A. Lanham, Style: An Anti-Text Book (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1974) and indirectly, but more tell- ingly, by phenomenologists like Heidegger, who have exposed the will to power that informs the grammar of metaphysics, and by linguists and critics deriving from Ferdinand de Saussure (Course in General Linguistics, ed. Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye and tr. Wade Baskin [New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966]), who have exposed the unbridgeable gap between signifier and signified, the emp- tiness of the sign. The Report continues to ground language use on the "nar- rative" model: on the logocentric assumption, in other words, that signifier and signified are identical, that language (like the Core Curriculum) is naturally en- dowed with the power to comprehend and master the mystery of being: to bring out of darkness into permanent and inescapable light (clarity) through the force of a systematic executive method (effectiveness) that, without digression and thus costly waste of time, which is money, gets rapidly to the essence-to the core-of (apparent) difference (conciseness). 17 Michel Foucault, "Nietzsche, Genealogy, History," Language, Counter- Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews, ed. Donald F. Bouchard, tr. Donald F. Bouchard and Sherry Simon (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1977), p. 143. The quotation is from Friedrich Nietzsche, The Wanderer and His Shadow. 18 Barry O'Connell, "Where Does Harvard Lead Us?," p. 64. 19 I. A. Richards, "The Future of the Humanities in General Education," Speculative Instruments, pp. 58-59. Elsewhere in his essay, Richards refers to this dispersal of Knowledge as "an illimitable proliferation ... of facts, com- ments, opinions, and mere phrases, too extensive and diverse to form, in any mind, not of a very rare order, any coherent, much less any directing or confirm- ing, view of essential human purpose" (p. 60). It needs to be said that Richards does not deny such a "directing or confirming view," only that the ordinary per- son cannot see it. 20 T. S. Eliot, "Tradition and the Individual Talent," Selected Essays, n.e. (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1950), p. 49. The interpretation of Eliot's idea of the tradi- tion to which the Harvard Core Curriculum refers is that canonized by I. A. Richards and the New Critical establishment. It is not necessarily the final reading. In fact, Eliot's essay may, if it is read in the context of his poetic prac- tice, be "misread" as precisely a de-struction of the metaphysical interpreta- tion of the New Criticism. See my essay "Repetition in the Waste Land: A Phenomenological De-struction," boundary 2, Vol. VII, 3 (Spring 1979), pp. 225-85. 21 Herman Melville, Moby Dick, ed. Harrison Hayford and Hershel Parker (New York: Norton Critical Edition, 1967), p. 470. 22 See Lionel Trilling, "On the Teaching of Modern Literature," Beyond Culture: Essays on Literature and Learning (New York: The Viking Press, 1965), pp. 3-30. 23 Jacques Derrida, "Force and Signification," Writing and Difference. Referring to the "structuralist" criticism of Jean Rousset in Forme et Signification: Essais sur les structures litteraires de Corneille 6 Claudel (Paris: Jose Corti, 1962), Derrida writes, "... for the sake of determining an essential 'Corneillean movement,' does not one lose what counts? Everything that defies a geometrical-mechanical framework-and not only the pieces which cannot be constrained by curves and helices, not only force and quality, which are mean- 31</page><page sequence="32">ing itself, but also duration, that which is pure qualitative heterogeneity within movement-is reduced to the appearance of the inessential for the sake of this essentialism or teleological structuralism. Rousset understands theatrical or novelistic movement as Aristotle understood movement in general: transition to the act, which itself is the repose of the desired form," pp. 20-21. 24 Michel Foucault, "The Discourse on Language," The Archeology of Knowledge, tr. A. M. Sheridan Smith (New York: Harper and Row, 1972): "... in order to belong to a discipline, a proposition must fit into a certain type of theoretical field. Suffice it to recall that the quest for primitive language, a perfectly accep- table theme up to the nineteenth century, was enough, in the second half of the nineteenth century, to throw discourse into, I hesitate to say error, but into a world of chimera and reverie-into pure and simple linguistic monstrosity. Within its own limits every discipline recognizes true and false propositions, but it repulses a whole teratology of learning" (p. 223). 25 I have discussed the relationship between the tradition and the countertradi- tion in literature (and literary criticism) in the following essays: "Modern Literary Criticism and the Spatialization of Time: An Existential Critique," JAAC, XXIX (Fall 1970), pp. 87-104; "Modern Drama and the Aristotelian Tradi- tion: The Formal Imperatives of Absurd Time," Contemporary Literature, XII (1971), pp. 345-72; "The Detective and the Boundary: Some Notes on the Postmodern Literary Imagination," boundary 2, Vol. I (Fall 1972), pp. 141-68; "The Un-Naming of the Beasts: The Postmodernity of Jean-Paul Sartre's La Naus6e," Criticism, Vol. XX (Summer 1978), pp. 223-80; "Hermeneutics and Memory: Destroying T.

Ernest Samuels (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1973), pp. 303-04. The quote within the quote is from p. 306. 27 This is, of course, the essential theme of Pynchon's fiction, especially V. and the Crying of Lot 49, both of which reveal the immediate influence of The Education of Henry Adams: "She [Oedipa Maas], had heard all about excluded middles: they were bad shit, to be avoided: and how had it ever happened here [in America], with the chances once so good for diversity?" (The Crying of Lot 49 [New York: Bantam Books, 1967], p. 136). 28 The distinction I am referring to is, of course, that which Martin Heidegger discovers in exploring the momentous forgetting of the original Greek under- standing of truth accompanying the Roman translation of aletheia as veritas. See Martin Heidegger, "Plato's Doctrine of Truth," tr. John Barlow, in Philosophy of the Twentieth Century: An Anthology, Vol. 3, ed. by William Bar- rett and Henry Aiken (New York: Random House, 1962): "Since for the Greeks at first hiddenness reigns throughout the essence of Being as a quality that hides itself and thereby defines even beings in their presence and accessibility ('truth'), the word the Greeks used for what the Romans called 'veritas' and we call 'truth' is distinguished by the a-privative (o&amp;-Xfl'O). At first truth meant what was wrested from a hiddenness. Truth then is just such a perpetual wrenching- away in the manner of uncovering" (p. 260). Veritas thus means truth as cor- respondence of mind and things, i.e. correctness. What the Latin word forgets is truth as temporal process. It is worth noting that this distinction assumes a greater and more precise ironic force in the motto of Yale University: Lux et Veritas. 29 Barry O'Connell, "Where Does Harvard Lead Us?," p. 65. O'Connell attributes this insufficiency to "a reverence for departmental prerogatives, the great sacred cow in the academy." 30 Edward Said, Orientalism, p. 12. 32</page><page sequence="33">31 Edward Said, Orientalism, pp. 248-50. Said cites Frederic Lef6vre, "One Heure avec Sylvain LBvi," in M6morial Sylvain L6vi, ed. Jacques Bacot (Paris: Paul Hartmann, 1937), pp. 123-24, as source of the quotation from L6vi. The em- phasis in the passage from LBvi is, as Said points out, L6vi's. 32 I. A.

Ralph Mannheim (Garden City, N. Y.: Anchor Books, 1961), p. 32. 38 The word "occasion" in Creeley's phrase derives immediately from the Latin occasus, "the setting of the sun," and, ultimately, from the ablative form of cadere, "to fall," "to perish," as in de casibus tragedy. Nor should it be forgot- ten (as the humanistic tradition has) that the word "Occident" comes from oc- cidere, a correlate of cadere and occasus. (The German word for the West, Ablendland, suggests more immediately than the English Latinate Occident the intimate relationship between the early idea of the West, the setting of the sun, and the mortality of human being.
