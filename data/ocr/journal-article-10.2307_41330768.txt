Bürge Institute of Ismaili Studies (London) Abstract In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries there were numerous studies of the isnãd in Hadït Studies, but more recently the discipline has focused on the role that Hadït played in the devel- opment of the four schools of SunnI law. These studies have still had a tendency to focus on the isnãd. However, there is a second stage in the compilation of Hadït that has received little atten- tion, namely a study of the way in which Hadït have been compiled and presented. The form and structure of a work should be able to give insights into a compilers viewpoints and beliefs. This article draws on two methodologies from Biblical Studies (Canonical and Redaction Criti- cism), as a means to approach and understand the (theological) statements lying behind the compilation of Hadït collections, using two case studies from al-Buhârï s Sahïh to explore the potential benefit of analysing the way hadïts are compiled: (i) the opening book of the work: Kitãb Bad ' al-wahy and (ii) the Kitãb al-Atima. By exploring the way in which a Kitãb has been compiled, it may be possible to reveal the authorial voice and opinions. Keywords Hadït, compilation, methodology, al-Buhârï, revelation Introduction After the publication of Ignaz Goldziher s Muhammedanische Studien ,2 non- Muslim studies in Hadït had a strong focus on the question of authenticity and the role of the isnãd . However, despite the work of scholars such as Schacht, Horovitz, and Robson,3 it has been found to be extremely difficult 1 I would like to thank Prof. Julia Bray who first introduced me to al-Buhârï and Hadït Stud- ies, Prof. Carole Hillenbrand for her comments and the Centre for the Advanced Study of the Arab World (CASAW), Edinburgh, where I first presented these ideas. 1 Ignaz Goldziher, Muhammedanische Studien , Halle, Max Niemeyer, 1889-90. 3 E.g.

Jonathan Browns more recent Canonization of al-Bukhãri and Muslim also attempts to understand the processes of Hadit science and the reception of the Sahihãn in the Islamic world.8 However, despite this shift away from the study of the isnãd to a study of the way in which the madãhib used hadit , these works still tend to ask questions about the processes assessing the reliability and validity of Hadit that scholars underwent when including hadit in their collections. There has, however, been little study on the form, style or structure of Hadit collections themselves.9 This is an area that has been rather neglected, with Andrew Newmans The Formative Period of Twelver Shi ism being one of the few monographs to address the way in which the structure and selection of hadito can be representative of compilers' claims on theological truth.10 isnãd in Muslim tradition", Transactions of the Glasgow University Oriental Society , 15 (1953), p. 15-26. 4 E.g.

Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 Admittedly, Ignaz Goldziher does refer to the skilful crafting of al-Buhârïs Sahiby particularly in his use of chapter titles ( tarãgim );n but on the whole, there have been very few explorations of this in Hadit Studies. Hadit compila- tion does not end with the scientific processes of hadït selection, i.e. with the assessment of the validity of all the hadits in a collection, but there is a further process of compilation-, the material has to be organised into some sort of order. The resulting form of the compilation should reveal important things about the theological and ideological opinions of the compilers themselves. Such an approach would aim to understand the motives behind the arrangement of hadits in a compilation. Although such methods have not been used in studies of the canonical col- lections, there has been some discussion of the methods of compilation in studies on mediaeval Arabic literature. Hilary Kilpatrick has studied Abu 1-Farag al-Isfahânïs methods of compilation in his Kitãb al-Agãni }2 Similar approaches to the Kitãb al-Agãni have also been made by As ad E. Khairallah and more comprehensively by Däwüd Sallüm.13 Fedwa Malti-Douglas has applied similar principles to a work of al-Hãtib al-Bagdâdï.14 After a discus- sion of the arrangement of the songs in the Agãniy Kilpatrick concludes: Hadït collections (of al-Kulaynï, al-Saffãr and al-Barqï) differed in content and arrangement, suggesting differing or competing statements about theological truth in Twelver Šťism; see p. 193-201. Eric Bishop also suggested that Form Criticism may be useful in ///«¿///Studies, but it does not seem to have been pursued any further, he comments: "Form-Criticism would have a very easy task with the ahadith as a whole, as with any selection or any of the groups into which the corpus might be subdivided."

Bishop, "Form-Criticism and the Forty-Two Tradi- tions of an-Nawawi", MW&gt; 30 (1940), p. 253-61, p. 261. 11 Concluding that "...Bukhãri tried to win over readers to a certain partisan opinion in the headings and introductions of the chapters in his collection."

[Abu 1-Farag] had the contents of the entire book in mind as he was work- ing, and his placing of the material in the Agdnï is not necessarily arbitrary."15 However, these methods do not seem to have been used in the study of non- literary Hadït collections. All of the six canonical Hadït collections do also, at times, appear to have been compiled in a slightly arbitrary way, and attempts to understand the methods of compilers can even be found in the numerous mediaeval com- mentaries on Hadït collections,16 such as Ibn Hagars (d. 852/1449) Fath al-bârï fi šarh Sahïh al-Buhârï (particularly the introduction, Hady al-sãrí ).17 However, the main aim of these commentaries is focused on the explanation of difficulties raised by certain chapter titles ( tarãgim ), rather than the form and structure of the work as a whole. Such studies are found less frequently on Hadït compilers, such as Muslim, whose tarãgim were added by a later author. The discussion of the interpretation of difficult tarãgim can also be found in contemporary Islamic scholarship, where there is some limited debate about the importance and meaning of the placement of hadït .18 It is the intention of this article to highlight the fact that stricter method- ological approaches found in literary theory and, in particular, Biblical Stud- ies, can be used to understand the methods that were used in the compilation of Hadït collections as a whole, not simply looking at specific cruces. The methodologies most useful for the analysis of Hadït collections are canonical criticism and redaction criticism. These two methodological approaches are particularly transferable to Hadït Studies because they do not ask questions about the origins of material included in a collection (cf. source criticism); rather they ask questions about the material as it has been presented. Brevard Childs, the founder of one of the two forms of canonical criticism, said that: "It is a basic tenet of the canonical approach that one reflects theologically on the text as it has been received and shaped."19 Canonical and redaction criticism both attempt to understand the methodology that the redactor or 15 Kilpatrick, Making the Great Book of Songs, p. 278. 16 See Fuat Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums , Leiden, Brill, 1967-1984, I, p. 118-26, 129; and Vardit Tokatly, "The A4äm al-hadith of al-Khattäbl: A Commentary on al-Bukhârï's Sahih or a polemical treatise", SI, 92 (2001) p. 53-91. 17 See Mohammed Fadel, "Ibn Hajars Hady al-Sãrh A Medieval Interpretation of the Structure of al-Bukhãris Al-Jãmí al-Sahïh' Introduction and Translation", JNES , 54 (1995), p. 161-97. 18 Muhammad Abdul Rauf, for example, explains why one may encounter some haaiths in a chapter that appear to be irrelevant to its title."

Bürge /Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 compiler undertook and to understand the theological and ideological prin- ciples behind the inclusion and exclusion of certain material. This article will use two case studies from al-Buhârls Sahih to assess whether an analysis of the structure of individual chapters can illuminate what an author, in this case al-Buhârï, is attempting to argue in a given chapter. The two case studies are: (i) the first book in the collection, the famous Kitãb Bad ' al-wahy ( The Book of the Beginning of the Revelation) and (ii) the Kitãb al- At ima ( The Book of Foods). These two books have been selected because they are very different. The first kitãb is very short, including only one bãb and seven hadits , whereas the К al-Atima is a substantial chapter including almost a hundred hadits. The К Bad ' al-wahy , being placed first in the work has obviously been given some importance by al-Buharl, whilst the К al-Atima is not so pre- dominant. The K. Bad 5 al-wahy has a particularly strong theological back- ground, which the K. al-Atimay being about food, does not have. Naturally, it is difficult to make extensive conclusions from the study of only two books in the work, but it is hoped that by analysing how these two, very different, sec- tions of Hadit are put together and arranged by al-Buharl may show that such a pursuit of compilation criticism' could be beneficial to the study of Hadit. Developing a Method of Compilation Criticism Having established what is included and excluded from a Hadit collection, there is a second process in the production of the text that has been largely ignored in the study of Hadit. The accepted material must be placed into the text in an order. How can scholars analyse and examine the way in which a collection of Hadit has been organised? What methods could be used most efficiently and successfully? Two methods in Biblical Studies may offer a suit- able methodology: redaction criticism and canonical criticism. These two critical methods both ask questions about the motivations behind the pro- cesses of compilation, as well as seeking solutions to the differences between authorship and compilation. The aim of this study is to show that these methodological approaches to the construction and arrangement of texts will enable a more nuanced understanding of Hadit collection, making them more than simply sources for particular items of information. Redaction criticism, a development of form criticism, was pioneered in Germany after the Second World War by Hans Conzelmann, Willi Marxsen and Günther Bornkamm.20 The method was developed to understand the 20 For a basic history of redaction criticism, see Norman Perrin, What is Redaction Criticism ?

Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 73 relationship between the three synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke). They sought answers to questions such as why Matthew included one narra- tive which was not included in Mark or Luke,21 or why one version includes one parable at the beginning of the Gospel, while others have the story at the end.22 Redaction criticism is based on the idea that there is not one single canon of authentic' traditions on the life of Jesus and that each Gospel author had to decide which parts to include and omit, creating a tension between the mass of information known about Jesus and the message that the Gospel writer wished to communicate through the traditions included in his account of the life of Jesus. This is why the Gospel writers are usually referred to as authors' and not as compilers' or 'redactors' - the work involved in the production of a Gospel required a high amount of what would normally be termed authorship', not in the sense of the production of fiction, but in the selection, retelling and structuring of the Gospel. Redaction criticism is probably most useful in the study of non-canonical Hadït collections, of which there are many, usually on specific subjects, such as death, eschatology, qualities of good character and so on, which existed and flourished throughout the classical period.23 In these circumstances the Hadït collectors are not restricted by which hadït can be included, and often these include non-Prophetic hadïts.2A In these cases the compilations milieu is Conzelmann, Mitte der Zeit : Studien zur Theologie des Lukas , Tübingen, Mohr, 1954; Willi Marxsen, Der Evangelist Markus: Studien zur Redaktionsgeschichte des Evangeliums , Göttingen, Vanderhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1956; and Günther Bornkamm, Heinz Held &amp; Gerhard Barth, Überlieferung und Auslegung im Matthäusevangelium, Neukirchen, Neukirchener Verlag, 1960.

Tollers &amp; John R. Maier (eds), Grand Rapids, William B. Eerdmanns, 1979, p. 344-61. 21 E.g. Matthew includes the Adoration of the Magi in his narrative of the Nativity which is not found in Mark, Luke or John (see Mt. 2:10-12); for further examples of the uses of Redac- tion Criticism, see Perrin, Redaction Criticism , p. 40-63. 22 E.g. Jesus' purification of the Temple occurs at the beginning of his ministry in Johns Gospel, but at the end of his ministry in the Synoptic Gospels (cf. Mt. 21:12-13; Mk. 11:15-17; Lk. 19:45-46 &amp; Jn 2:14-22). 23 Galãl al-Dln al-Suyùtï (d. 911/1505) epitomises the non-canonical Hadït genre, with a vast number of collections compiled by him on topics ranging from history to grammar and meteorology to angelology; see E.M.

Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 more akin to that of the Gospel writers. A great many hadïts (including non- Prophetic baditi) are available for selection and the compiler is free to choose what to include and exclude.25 It is less helpful in collections that have been based solely on an assessment of isnãds - in this case the Hadit collector includes material that has satisfied the requirements for inclusion. Indeed, these requirements were often the basis of attacks on individual compilers, such as Ibn Mãga whose Sunan was criticised for containing weak hadïts .26 The second methodology that may be of use to Hadit is canonical criti- cism. It is not, as a discipline, interested in comparison; rather it is interested in generality and unity - an attempt to understand a work as a whole. Where canonical criticism differs from redaction criticism is in the understanding of internal relationships within a corpus of related texts.27 Whereas redaction criticism tends to look at the inclusion and exclusion of specific sections of a text in comparison with different versions of the same events, canonical criti- cism looks at only one text, and how the components in that text relate to each other. Canonical criticism has been most successful in attempting to understand the way in which certain books of the Bible were ordered: the Books of Psalms and Proverbs, as well as the Minor Prophets provide obvious ques- tions. For example, the ordering of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Hebrew Bible is not done by any obvious process: they are not ordered by length (a common method of ordering texts in Near Eastern cultures, e.g. the Qur an, the Pauline corpus), by chronology (either as understood by the text inter- nally or by actual historical dating), or even alphabetically. As the ordering of the books in the canonical context was not done by standard procedures, it has to be assumed that the books were ordered in that way for a particular Européenne des Arabisants et Islamisants, Halle 1998 , S. Leder (ed.), Leuven, Peeters, 2002, p. 421-36, 424. 25 Newman highlights the fact that the three early Šťí Hadit collections discussed in his monograph "...varied in terms of those who narrated the traditions as well as the styles of organisation and, perhaps, most importantly, in terms of the substance of the traditions each had to offer." Newman, Formative Periody p. 193. 26 See James Robson, "The Transmission of Ibn Majah's 'Sunan ", /55, 3 (1958), p. 129-41, p. 129-31. The way in which the hadits in the 'canonical' collections were analysed is usually regard for their designation as 'canonical' works; see Muhammad Zubayr Siddlql, (ed. &amp; rev. Abdal Hakim Murad), Hadith Literature: Its Origin Development &amp; Special Features , Cambridge, Islamic Texts Society, 1993, p. 73-5. 27 See Sanders, Canon and Community and Robert W. Wall, Eugene E. Lemcio, The New Testament as Canon: A Reader in Canonical Criticism , Sheffield, SCM ("Journal for the Study of the New Testament Supplements Series", 76), 1992.</page><page sequence="8">R. Bürge /Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 75 reason: canonical critics and theologians have attempted to study this.28 The basic drive behind this process is the idea that understanding a biblical text in its canonical context is important: a text is not just important in and of itself, but because of its place in the general scheme of a larger body of texts. Some aspects of canonical criticism are helpful in understanding the arrangement of hadïts within a collection and developing strategies for unveil- ing the reasons behind such an arrangement. This would be particularly use- ful for examining the general structure of individual chapters, such as the К al-Atima ,29 and even the Sahïh as a whole - although that would be a much larger project. Canonical criticism also offers a different approach to the criticism of hadïts and their collection based on the scientific analysis of the isnãd. Take for example the recent study by Jonathan Brown, in which he argues that matn-cúúcism was also employed (albeit covertly) in the early systématisa- tion of the Hadït sciences, even by key figures such as al-Buhãrl and Muslim.30 Brown argues that, when encountering a false matn with a sound isnãd, fig- ures like al-Buhãrl purposefully made the isnãd weak to defend the Prophet; thus 'hiding the matn- criticism.31 Such an analysis of Hadït misses the larger picture: the community and the compilers themselves argued that this was the method that was pursued in the collections, and as this was the basis by which the community perceived the canonical collections, this is the way in which the collections should be understood, be it reality or not. Debating the existence of matn- criticism is a very specific question and does not reveal that much about the methods of Hadït compilation. Whilst the study of the isnãd can provide interesting avenues of research, understanding Hadït collections as they have been presented and arranged is equally important. This is, in essence, the way in which canonical critics approach the Bible, and it gives its study a new angle: instead of focusing on the history of the text and its sources, scholars began to accept the text as it was presented and ask questions about 2H E.g. Barry Allan Jones, The Formation of the Book of the Twelve , Atlanta, Scholars Press, 1995 and James Nogalski, Redactional Processes in the Book of the Twelve , Berlin, W. de Gruyter, 1993. 29 See Case Study II below. 30 See Jonathan A.C. Brown, "How We Know Early Hadlth Criticism Did Matn Criticism and Why Its So Hard to Find", Islamic Law &amp; Society, 15 (2008), p. 143-84. 31 However, the reference to the isnãd does not mean that Hadit critics were involved in a community-wide project to obfuscate matn- criticism, it simply testifies to the primacy of the isnãd in the formative period of Hadit criticism. In fact, Jonathan Browns study of al-Dâraqutnï s criticisms of al-Buhãrls Sahïh actually testifies to the primacy of the isnãd over the matn' see Jonathan A.C. Brown, "Criticism of the Proto-Hadith Canon: Al-Dâraqutnï s Adjustment of the SahihaynJIS , 15 (2004), p. 1-37.</page><page sequence="9">1 76 S. R. Bürge /Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 what messages its final presentation was attempting to convey.32 Some canon- ical critics also argue that it is important to take a text within the context of its interpretative tradition: that is, it is important to consider the Bible (or Hadït collections) in the context of the beliefs of the community that produced them.33 These two methodologies form Biblical Studies cannot simply be trans- planted into the study of Hadït collections, because the Hebrew Bible under- went a radically different process of canonization. The Hadït canon is not the same as a scripture and an individual scholars exclusion of hadït is not neces- sarily on theological grounds; but could simply be because the muhaddit had not heard it, or had different criteria for assessing the isnãd. However, these two methodologies ask questions of the Biblical text that can also be asked of Hadït. Why is this hadït and not another included in the collection? Why has this particular hadït been included in this chapter and not another chapter? Why do different Hadït compilers arrange the Hadït in different ways? Such questions have not really been asked of Hadït and methodologies in Biblical Studies may provide a basis from which to begin such an analysis of Hadït and their compilation. Unlike many other forms of Arabic scholarly work, such as philosophical, scientific or theological treatises, //^¿//collectors and compilers are not always open about their theological opinions. Often their argument has to be extracted from the way in which the text has been presented. For critics of Hadït it is important to acknowledge that compilers wished individual hadïts to be grouped and arranged in a particular way, and that, as critics, it is pos- sible to develop ideas about why this was done and why they were presented in that manner.34 The advantage of these methods is that it does not matter whether scholars can or cannot know whether a hadït is authentic or not. Instead, criticism of Hadït compilation based on both the methods of canonical and redaction 32 For example, source-critics attributed the Pentateuch to four different authors (J, E, P &amp; D) and Isaiah to three; but Brevard Childs, a major exponent of one form of canonical criti- cism, believed that the Biblical text should be studied as it has been received: "The discipline of Old Testament theology derives from theological reflection on a received body of scripture, whose formation was the result of a lengthy period of development." Childs, Old Testament Theology , p. 6; cf. Childs, Brevard, Introduction to the Old Testamentas Scripture, London, SCM, 1979, p. 311-38. 33 James A. Sanders, Canon and Community: A Guide to Canonical Criticism, Philadelphia, Fortress Press, 1984. 34 Cf. James Sanders: "Canonical criticism says we should continue to honor what our ances- tors in the faith had in mind as well as learn from the result of the labour of biblical criticism."

R Bürge /Arabica 58 (201 1) 168-197 1 77 criticism would attempt to understand how the compilation was shaped by the compiler, and the significance of the placement of individual hadïts or chapters within the text. There is no methodological approach in another dis- cipline that can be easily transferred into the study of Hadït' however, canon- ical and redaction criticism can highlight important questions and responses for approaching and understanding Hadït compilations. The two case studies outlined below attempt to show the usefulness of what could be called compi - lation criticism , and the way in which criticism of the way in which hadïts are arranged and compiled can be used to explore the motivations behind the construction and arrangement of hadïts within a text. Case Study I: The Book on the First Revelation Al-Buhârïs Sahïh was revered by the Muslim community relatively shortly after its compilation, despite some early criticism.35 However, al-Buhãrí s own introductions ( tarãgim ) to the individual books and chapters presented par- ticular problems for the Muslim community, as they often bear little resem- blance to the hadïts included in the text; as Tokatly remarks: The commentators discuss these problems at length, either with regard to spe- cific instances or with general discussions in their introductions. The importance of the tarãjim as well as their problematic nature led several scholars to go even further and write monographs on the tarãjim alone.36 However, the focus of both mediaeval commentators and modern scholarship has focused almost entirely on al-Buhârl s tarãgim. The methods of canonical (and to a certain extent redaction) criticism show that the ordering or arrange- ment of material within a text is equally important, and could reinforce the ideas found in the tarãgim. Furthermore, the organisation of Hadït in chapters headed by non-problematic titles may also reveal rewarding results. The case study below looks at one, extremely small unit of hadït (al-Buhârl s hadït on the First Revelation) and illustrates the use of canonical and redaction criti- cism. Being the first kitãb that the reader encounters when starting the Sahïh , it is likely that al-Buhãrí organised and structured the chapter with the most care. It is for this reason that this particular chapter has been selected for the first case study. 35 "Around the end of the IVth/Xth century, the Sahïh collections of al-Buhãrí and Muslim first emerged as kanòns of authenticity."

Bürge / Arabica 58 (201 1) 168-197 Chapter Placement As the six canonical collections are all ordered according to topic ( musannaf ), each compiler is free to arrange the material in any way. This freedom allows the compiler to express particular beliefs or opinions. So, before looking at the contents of al-Buhãris chapter on the beginning of Muhammad s pro- phetic experience, it is useful to compare how and where the other hadïts compilers have placed them. This creates a useful context from which to start looking at al-Buhãris intentions behind his compilation methods. Al-Buhãrl places the hadïts about the first revelation together in the first chapter and book of the Sahïh. The book has the short title: The Book of the Beginning of the Revelation { Kitãb Bad ' al-wahy ), and includes only one bãb with seven hadïts under the heading: How the revelation first came to the Messenger of God ( Bãb kayfa kãna bad ' al-wahy ilã rasül Állãh) . 37 The kitãb is followed by the much larger Book of Faith { К al-Imãn). Al-Buhãris placement of this material differs from the other canonical collections. Muslim, for exam- ple, includes these hadïts in his Book of Faith {K. al-Imãri) but in the seventy- fourth chapter, and the title, added later, is similar to that of al-Buhãrl: The beginning of the revelation to the Messenger of God {Bãb bad ' al-wahy ilã rasül Allãh). Looking at the titles alone, al-Buhãris use of kayfa kãna does mark a subtle difference: how indicates a description of revelation {i.e. in what way, in what form), not simply a narrative account of the events in the cave at Hirã' - when the contents of the chapter are analysed, such subtleties need to be addressed. Another important distinction between al-Buhãri and the other canonical collections is the placement of the chapter in the context of the rest of the work. The chapter on the first revelation is the very first chapter encountered when the Sahïh is opened, but in Muslims Sahïh it is buried between a chapter entitled: Description of the period in which faith would not be acceptable {Bãb bayãn al-zAman alladï lã yuqbalu fihi l-imãri)' and the chapter entitled: The Night Journey of the Messenger of God to the Heavens and the making of the prayers obligatory {Bãb al-isra bi-rasùl Allãh ilã al-samãwãt wa-fard al-salawãt) . 38 This puts the hadïts in quite a different context: al-Buhãri gives prominence to the narratives of the first revelation by placing them at the very beginning of his collection, Muslim does not. 37 Al-Buhãri, Abu 'Abd Allãh b.

R. Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 79 Despite the fact that the Sahïhân both begin with chapters on faith (albeit the first substantial chapter in al-Buharl), they have very different approaches: Muslim chooses to begin his work with general expositions on the nature and meaning of faith; al-Buhäri starts from the very beginning of what was to become the Muslim community, creating an almost salvation-historical narra- tive of Islam. Differences in approach can be seen further when the Sahïhân are compared to the collections of al-Tirmidï, Abu Dâ'ûd and al-Nasa I, who do not begin with chapters on faith, but focus on ritual purity.39 By placing the chapters on ritual purity first, the implication is that they believe that ritual purity should be the main emphasis of the collection, or the essential prelude to everything that follows. These differences may reflect differing intended readerships, but more research would need to be carried out on the rest of the works, before any conclusions can be reached. Chapter Contents &amp; General Structure For brevity and ease of comparison only the chapters on the first revelations by Muslim and al-Buhäri will be analysed, rather than all of the canonical collections. The Sahïhân are the most well known, most easily accessible and most frequently consulted. Both Muslim and al-Buhârï (as is generally typical of the canonical collections) contain only a few hadïts in their chapters. 39 Al-Nasaï, Ahmad b.

Al-Buhãrl, however, includes hadïts which appear to have little to do with the first revelation: particularly BI, B2 and B5-B7. Muslim does include these hadïts , but he disperses them throughout the rest of his collection: B1 is in the K. al-Imãra' B2: К. al-Fadaik B4: К. al-Imãn ; B5: К. al-Salãt , В6: К al-Fadail' and В7: К. al-ôihãd.A0 There is an important difference in the relationship between the first and second revelations in Muslim and al-Buhãrl. These two separate events are linked in Islamic tradition: Muhammad received the first revelation in the cave of Hirã', left the cave and then had the second revelation. This is seen particularly clearly in M7 in which the two are combined in one narrative 40 Muslim, Sahïh: B1 = Bk. 20, Chp. 45, VI, p. 48; B2 = 30:22, VII, p. 82; B4 = 1:74, 1, p. 98; B5 = 4:29, III, p. 34-5; B6 = 30:12, VII, p. 73; B7 = 19:25, V, p. 163-4.</page><page sequence="14">R.

Muslims inclusion of Ml &amp; M4, with their variants, reveals the exclu- sivity of Muslims chapter structure in this case: it is only about the first reve- lation. Al-Buhãrl does not include any variants that combine the first and second revelations; but he does juxtapose them, and to a Muslim reader aware of the historical sequencing of the first and second revelations, this connection between B3 &amp; B4 would be quite obvious. The main difference between the content of al-Buhãrl and Muslims chapters on the first revela- tion is al-Buhãrls inclusion of material that is not overtly relevant. This will require deeper analysis, which can be seen below. Chapter Structure &amp; Meaning It is not my intention to give full discussions of the meanings of these seven hadits , but on the significance of their ordering. The hadit of HeracliusAX has been given the most attention by modern scholars, especially Louis Pouzet and Nadia El-Cheikh; but these have mainly focused on the hadit itself in isolation.42 These two articles approach the hadit of Heraclius in much the same way as other past studies of individual hadit or small groups of hadits , which is a method of approaching traditions that has a long history in Hadit Studies, with the work of M.J. Kister being a particularly prominent example.43 As seen above, al-Buhãrl introduces his chapter with a quotation from the Quran (Kor 4, 163) : "We have revealed to thee as We revealed to Noah, and the prophets after him. . ."44 Even before a single hadit has been read, al-Buhãri nudges his reader into a particular reading of the text, placing the experience of Muhammad in the direct line of prophetic revelation from Noah. The notion of a narrative frame in mediaeval Arabic literature is very familiar, but here the targama seeks to place the hadit in a specific milieu. This causes the reader to interpret the hadit included in the kitãb in a particular way. The fol- lowing statements are read in light of the Qur ãnic verses cited by al-Buharl at the beginning of the kitãb.Ab 41 An outline of this hadit is given below. 42 See Nadia El-Cheikh, "Muhammad and Heraclius: A Study in Legitimacy", SI , 89 (1999), p. 5-21 and Louis Pouzet, "Le Hadïth de Heraclius: Une caution Byzantine à la prophétie de Muhammad", in Pierre Canivet &amp; Jean- Paul Rey-Coquais (eds), La Syrie de Byzance à l'Islam, VIIe -VIIIe siècles , Damascus, Institut Français de Damas, 1992, p. 59-65. 43 See various articles in M.J.

Bürge / Arabica 58 (201 1) 168-197 The placement of the first hadït is in itself quite interesting and tells us a great deal about al-Buhãrí s intentions for his Sahïh. The first hadït has noth- ing to do with revelation, but because of its placement in this chapter it must be assumed that al-Buhârï gave the hadït such prominence for a reason. One possible reason could be that this particular hadït, that stresses the impor- tance of intentions in action, is intended for the whole collection: al-Buhãrl could be saying that following the sunna of the Prophet (through his collec- tion), is only valued according to the intention of the person doing the action. The fact that al-Buhãrl decided to begin the collection with such a sentiment implies that he considered this an extremely important part of Muslim life, and secondly that he may have intended the work to be read as a whole, rather than used as an encyclopaedia of the Prophetic sunna . Maulana Aftab-ud-Din Ahmad comments: This hadlth is like an introduction to the whole collection, as its subject-matter is not related to this chapter in particular. It is a very appropriate introduction indeed, for it shows not only the sincerity of purpose of the author but also warns the reader that the food and noble deeds to which he is guided. . .will pros- per only if there is sincerity of spirit.46 Another, third, possible explanation for its inclusion in this chapter is that al-Buhãrl intended this hadït to be considered along with the six remaining hadïts . It is possible that al-Buhãrl intended to imply both of these sugges- tions, but further analysis of the rest of the Sahïh is needed. The second hadït is the first hadït in the chapter that deals with revelation, but it does not deal with the first revelation.47 It must be assumed that the placement of the hadït in this location serves some sort of service to the text. The hadït describes the physical effects of Muhammad s revelatory experience, which manifests itself in different ways.48 The hadït seems to be being used to Charles and John make love with their wives?", then the answer is an innocent statement of fact. If the question were: "What is going on between John, Charles and his wife?", then the response is not innocent at all. A frame or topic influences the interpretation of a statement.

Bürge /Arabica 58 (201 1) 168-197 1 83 help explain the physical aspects of Muhammad's first revelation in B3, in which similar experiences are noted, but given little explanation. There are two good examples: firstly consider the statement in B2 that "... the Angel comes to me in the likeness of a man and he speaks to me and I retain mem- ory of what he says."49 The arrival of Gabriel in B3 is not preceded by any explanation of his form: . . . [he] took provisions for this, then he would return to Khadija and take provi- sions for a similar period until the Truth came to him while he was in the cave of Hira . So the Angel came to him and said, "Read."50 Having read B2, in which the angel is said to come to Muhammad in the form of a human, the appearance and anthropomorphic actions of the celes- tial being can be understood. Likewise, Muhammads reaction to the revela- tion is, when taken in isolation, unusual and difficult to understand. The Messenger of Allah (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) returned with this (message) while his heart trembled and he entered upon Khadija, daughter of Khuwailid, and said, "Wrap me up, wrap me up." And they wrapped him up until the awe left him.51 Muhammads behaviour is made clearer if read in conjunction with B2, in which 'Ä'isa states that: I saw [the Prophet] when the revelation came down upon him on a severely cold day, then it departed from him and his forehead dripped with sweat.52 Ã isa describes the physical effects of the revelation that Muhammad experi- enced throughout his ministry, making the illness described in B3 a normal, relatively habitual reaction to the revelatory experience. Through the careful placement of the hadït, a dramatic scene becomes more natural and easier to understand. The validity of the prophetic experience at Hira is also con- firmed through the symptoms that Muhammad receives afterwards; just as Muslims contemporary with Muhammad would have understood his reac- tion in terms of religious experience, so to can the readers of the Sahïh. When the text moves to B4, the phrase "Wrap me up, wrap me up" is repeated; 4' Ahmad, English Translation of Sahih al-Bukhari , p. 3. 50 Ibid. p. 4-5. 51 Ibid. p. 6. 52 Ibid. p. 3.</page><page sequence="17">1 84 5. R. Bürge ! Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 reiterating the relationship between prophetic experience and its resultant physical symptoms. As mentioned above, the fourth hadit is a chronological continuation of B3, but a number of phrases link the experience of the second revelation directly to the first, particularly: "the Angel that had appeared to me in Hirã'. . ." and "I returned and said, 'Wrap me up, wrap me up"'53 This creates a sense of unity between the two hadits , and continues to describe the Proph- et s early experiences of revelation in the same terms. However, the hadit also adds a new form of religious experience - the vision of the throne. These three hadïts (B2-4) present Muhammad s revelatory experience in a range of aspects: (i) Muhammads prophetic ministry is confirmed by the descriptions of the symptoms of the revelatory experience (B2), (ii) the appearance of the angel (B3), (iii) the scriptural authority of Waraqa b. Naw- fal (B3) and (iv) the vision of the Throne (B4). These different expressions and descriptions of the revelatory experience are also common in Judeo- Christian writings. The prophet Daniel, for example, states after a vision: "As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly terrified me, and my face turned pale. . ."54 The link with the Judeo-Christian typology of revelation is seen further in the role of Gabriel as an intermediary for revelation, the vision of the Throne and the confirmation of a Judeo-Christian figure in Waraqa b. Nawfal. It seems not to be coincidental that Muhammads revelatory experience is couched in all the Jewish and Christian imagery of the prophetic experience, especially when placed in the context of the Qur anic quotation at the begin- ning of the chapter: We have revealed to thee as We revealed to Noah, and the prophets after him [and We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, Jesus, Job, Jonah and Aaron, and Solomon, and We gave to David the Psalms] . . .55 Although not included in the quotation by al-Buhârï, the continuation of the verse listing the different prophets would have been easily remembered by a Muslim. For Muslims, Muhammad is a direct continuation of this line of Judeo-Christian prophets and al-Buhãrl arranges the hadit to reflect this. 53 Ibid. p. 9. 54 Daniel 7, 28 {New Revised Standard Version). 55 Kor 4, 163; Arberry, Koran , p. 96.</page><page sequence="18">5. R. Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 85 There is not only a sense of Muhammad as prophet in line with other Judeo- Christian prophets, but Hadlga also describes Muhammad as the embodi- ment of virtue:56 Nay, by Allah, Allah will never bring thee to disgrace; for thou unitesi the ties of relationship and bearest the burden of the weak and earnest for the destitute and honourest the guest and helpest in real distress.57 Muhammads noble qualities of character are also referred to directly in the text of the Qur an: By the Pen, and what they inscribe, thou art not, by the blessing of thy Lord, a man possessed. Surely thou shalt have a wage unfailing, surely thou are upon a mighty morality. So thou shalt see, and they will see, which of you is the demented.58 Muhammad's noble qualities became a template for Muslims to follow, typi- fied in adab works on the subject.59 Ebrahim Moosa comments that: Numerous prophetic reports place an extraordinary emphasis on the need to cul- tivate good character, husn al-khuluq. It appears as if the aesthetic qualities of beauty ( husn ), inherent in good, serves as an antidote to sinful behaviour.60 These qualities of noble character became standard templates for Muslim behaviour, and are encapsulated in a hadït of the Prophet s wife, 'Ä'isa: There are ten noble qualities of character ( makãrim al-ahlãq ): Speaking the truth, firm courage in obeying God, giving to the suppliant, repaying good deeds, strengthening family ties, returning deposits entrusted to one for safe-keeping, 36 For a discussion of the technical terms used in Arabic for Virtue' and its place in pre- Islamic and Islamic society, see: Bichr Farès, L'honneur chez Les Arabes avant l'Islam: étude de sociologie , Paris, Maisonneuve, 1932. 57 Ahmad, English Translation ofSahih al-Bukhari , p. 6. 5* Kor 68, 1-4; Arberry, Koran , p. 599. 5y The most famous being, Ibn Abi 1-Dunyã, Kitãb Makãrim al-ahlãq' James Bellamy (ed.), The Noble Qualities of Character , Wiesbaden, F.

R. Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 behaving honourably towards neighbours, behaving honourably towards friends, hospitality to guests, and modesty, which is chief of them all.61 These particular qualities are also reflected in the seven hadïts of the first chapter of al-Buhãrls Sahïh . For example, Hadlgas speech to Muhammad seen above highlights a number of these virtues, as does B6, which empha- sises his generosity: The Messenger of Allah was the most generous of men and he was the most gen- erous that he could be in Ramadan when Gabriel met him, . . . the Messenger of God was more generous in doing good that the wind which is sent forth (on everyone).62 However, the significance of these virtues is not made particularly apparent, until the seventh and longest hadït of Heraclius. The h adit of Heraclius is a final confirmation of Muhammads prophethood, in which the Byzantine Emperor tests the emissaries of Muhammad and confirms Muhammad s pro- phetic mission: the acceptance of an outsider is seen to be the ultimate con- firmation. Nadia El-Cheikh concludes that: Heraclius is called to bear witness to the prophethood of Muhammad as well as to the righteousness of his emerging community. The nascent umma could not have wished for a more impressive ruler on whom to base its aspirations towards legitimacy.63 Nadia El-Cheikh notes further that: "In order to establish the legitimacy of Muhammad, Heraclius inquires about the prophets character and lineage so as to authenticate his authority."64 The relationship between authority and character was important, and both B3 and B7 portray Muhammad in this light. Both hadïts also use outsiders to legitimise Muhammads prophethood: Waraqa b. Nawfal is a Jew or Christian - or, at the very least, acquainted with the Hebrew Scriptures; Heraclius, the Christian Emperor, tests Muhammads prophetic role on a number of different levels; and it is Abü Sufyãn, the enemy of Muhammad, who is present at Heraclius court.

R Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 87 Pour renforcer cette crédibilité, le rapporteur du hadith souligne la présence des compagnons d'Abû Sufyân, qu'Héraclius a eu soin de faire placer derrière ce dernier durant l'interrogatoire, pour contrôler la véracité de ses dires et l'obliger ainsi à dire la vérité.65 Here we see an important theme that links B3 with B7, which makes the rea- sons behind the inclusion of the hadit of Heraclius in this particular chapter quite clear. The chapter is not simply about the first revelation on Mount Hira , but about Muhammads prophetic mission in more general terms. What then of the fifth haditi The fifth hadit, an exegesis of Kor 75, 16,66 does not appear to be entirely relevant to a chapter on the First Revelation. However, its inclusion is significant. This particular hadit gives an account of the way in which the Qur anic text was transmitted: Ibn 'Abbas says that "his lips moved as the Messenger of God s lips moved." What this hadit does, in this location, is confirming that the material of the Qur an is a direct copy of the text that was revealed to the Prophet, and not invented by others over time. This chapter has already given historical accounts of the first verses of the Qurãn (96, 1-4 and 74, 1-5), and B5 gives authenticity to them. Al-Buhârï is not simply presenting material that is relevant to each of the designated chapters, but is constructing this chapter in a particular way. If we return to the first hadit again, the hadit gains significance when placed in the context of the remaining hadit. Acceptance of Muhammads prophethood is only valued if Muhammad's prophetic is accepted out of belief; the accep- tance of Muhammad's prophethood and his revelation for any other reason (such as material gain) is not valued. Al-Buhãrís Chapter on Revelation Al-Buhärl's construction of this chapter appears to aid reading, which would further imply that al-Buhãrl intended the work to be read - had al-Buhãrl intended to compile an encyclopaedia the hadits would probably have been arranged in a different way, and with (perhaps) much less care. The consider- ation about the placement of the hadits is evident in the inclusion of hadit that could have easily fitted into other chapters in the Sahih' the first, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh hadits could very easily be placed, and would proba- bly be expected to be, in different chapters. The fact that they are included in 65 Pouzet, "Hadith d'Héraclius", p. 60. 66 "Move not thy tongue with it to hasten it; Ours it is to gather it, and to recite it. So, when We recite it, follow thou its recitation." Kor 75, 16-18; Arberry, Korani p. 619.</page><page sequence="21">1 88 5. R. Bürge ! Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 different chapters in the other five canonical collections would seem to cor- roborate this. Taken as a whole, the chapter on Muhammads first revelation seems to have a wider message than simply retelling the story. The seven hadïts seem to be acting as one unit. As already mentioned above, there is a subtlety in the title of the chapter: How the revelation first came to the Messenger of God (Bãb kayfa kãna bad ' al-wahy ila rasiti Allah). The chapter does more than simply provide a narrative account of the first revelation, as Muslim does; al-Buhârï describes both the first revelation and the experience of revelation. The expe- rience of revelation is discussed both physically and in more abstract terms. The detailed picture of the Prophet during periods of revelation acts to con- firm the veracity of his prophetic experience; likewise, the various comments about the Prophets character, seek to establish and portray him as a man worthy of prophethood. Whilst all Muslims and Hadit compilers accept this position, it is only al-Buhãrl who uses the placement of hadïts to convey these ideas in his Sahih . Al-Buhârï does not simply include hadïts to state his position, but also uses a number of other devices to help the reader understand his thinking on the subject of revelation. For example, the use of the Qur anic quotation at the beginning of the chapter frames the seven hadïts in a wider context: from the very opening of the chapter, it is clear that al-Buhârï wants his reader to think beyond the details of the first revelation, but of prophethood more gen- erally. Al-Buhârï also places the hadïts with extreme care, and their ordering allows clearer reading. The most obvious example is the description of the prophetic experience, before the rather oblique references to it in the narra- tive of the first revelation. However, even the final hadït of Heraclius can be seen as a denouement of the chapter, with the six previous hadïts providing the evidence for Heraclius' authentication of Muhammad s prophethood, with the reader almost taking the role of Heraclius. The reader is prompted to ask the same questions as Heraclius, and to come to the same conclusions as the Byzantine Emperor. Case Study II: The Book of Foods In any written work, the first chapter that is encountered is always going to be particularly important. The analysis of the structure of the K. Bad ' al-wahy , which opens al-Buhârïs Sahïh shows that there may be some theological or practical reason behind the way in which the hadïts have been arranged. The question remains, however, whether interpreting the way in which al-Buhârï</page><page sequence="22">S. R. Bürge /Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 89 presents his material can be of use in other areas of the Sahih&gt; especially over much larger units of Hadit. This second case study focuses on the Kitãb al-Atima , and aims to explore such methods in a theologically neutral envi- ronment. In discussions about food, there are relatively few areas which can be affected significantly by a particular hermeneutic approach or worldview.67 Al-Buhãrl s Kitãb al-Atima ( The Book of Foods) contains ninety-six hadits , in fifty-nine abwãb , with the majority of abwãb only containing one or two hadits. There is also a limited use of tarägim in this chapter. In the wider scheme of the Sahih , the Kitãb al-Atima is the seventieth kitãb. This chapter is preceded by the Kitãb al-Nafaqãt {The Book of Support) which outlines how families and the needy should be supported by the community; and it is fol- lowed by the Kitãb al-Aqiqa ( The Book of the ' Aqïqa ), concerning the sacrifice of an animal in celebration of the birth of a child and related practices such as tahnik. The overarching theme of the chapter is that food is related to com- munity and the concept of sharing. The first hadit outlines this position and the majority of the remaining hadits place eating and banned foods in the context of sharing a meal. This is quite different to approach to the topic of food compared to those works of fiqh, such as Ibn Rušds Bidãyaf 8 and the other canonical collections.69 The chapter is not particularly concerned with outlining prohibited foods in any way. The structure of the chapter is not overtly clear, and if one simply looks at the titles of each of the abwãb , there is little evidence of any overarching orga- nization of the hadits. However, throughout the chapter there are some larger units that help piece the contents of the chapter together, creating larger units of Hadit around which the individual abwãb centre. The main principles behind the formation of the groups are: (i) some groups, especially repetitions of variants of the same hadit, form a natural group; (ii) in some instances there is a sudden change of focus, which marks the beginning of a new group; (iii) a targama may indicate a new group; (iv) particular words or phrases may run through the group of hadits that link them together. 67 There will, of course, be some jurisprudential disputes that affect food. 68 Cf.

Bürge / Arabica 58 (201 1) 168-197 In some circumstances, it is difficult to mark the divisions between the differ- ent groups of hadits , and, although it can be a subjective process, the group indicators above help make such divisions more objective. Larger, more gen- eral groupings, may also reveal a wider logic to the organization of the Hadit within a kitãb. The Kitãb al-Atima can be divided into fourteen main groups, which form four larger sections.70 Section 1 - Feeding the Poor ( В . 1; §1-3) The first group (A) highlights the ethics surrounding food and the need for people to give food to the poor and needy.71 This continues the theme of community action found in the previous kitãb , possibly indicating that the Sahih was meant to read, rather than used as an encyclopaedia. The chapter title is simply a Qur anic quotation: "Chapter on the Words of God, Most High, 'Eat the good things wherewith We have provided you../"72 which is supported by a further two quotations from the Qurãn in the targama: "... expend of the good things you have earned"; and: "... eat of the good thing and do righteousness; surely I know the things that you do."73 Placing this theme at the opening of the chapter places the following discussions about food in a theological and ethical context. Section 2 - Manners ( В . 2-13; §4-27) Interestingly, the next group of hadits (В: B. 2-6; 4-11) is concerned with the adab of eating, again delaying any discussion of the permissibility or imper- missibility of specific food stuffs. Table manners, and manners in general, are an important feature of Islamic culture, so it is not surprising to see etiquette given such importance by al-Buhärl in the Sahih.7A The five hadits included 70 A table outlining these different groups can be found below. 71 This is a predominant theme in the Qurãn and early Islam, see Michael Boner, "Poverty and Charity in the Rise of Islam", in Michael Bonner et al. (eds.), Poverty and Charity in Middle Eastern Contexts , Albany, State University of New York Press, 2003, p. 13-30. 72 Kor 2, 57; 2, 172; 7, 160 and 20, 81. 73 Kor 2, 267 and 23, 51. 74 E.g. al-Tirmidï, al-Šamail al-muhammadiyya , ed.

Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 9 1 over four abwãb in this section highlight the importance of eating with the right hand and from the nearest or right-hand side of the bowl.75 The third group of hadits (С: В. 7-10; §12-19) is the most intriguing, as there does not appear to be any arrangement of the hadïts at first sight. Over the eight hadits in this section, there are two hadïts which appear more than once: one about a group of travellers making a journey to Haybar during which they eat sawiq7e (§12, 15 &amp; 18)77 and another in which the Prophet is presented with roasted lizard ( dabb mahnüd)72, which he rejects, but which is not impermissible to eat (§17 &amp; 19).79 The other hadïts in this group state that the Prophet never ate thin bread (hubz muraqqaq )80 or roast lamb {sat masmútã : §13), state the Prophet did not use a dining table, but a dining sheet (sukruga: §14 &amp; 1 5), and that the Prophet carried his food and water in leather containers (§16). The organization of this group seems very haphazard, espe- cially the location of the hadit about the journey to Haybar - why has it been repeated, and why are there other hadïts between them? Is there any logic to the way al-Buhãrl has presented this material? The title of chapter seven may provide a hint, it reads: "Chapter on 'There is no fault in the blind, and there is no fault in the lame and there is no fault in the sick. . .' "81 This verse continues: '. . . neither in yourselves, that you eat of your houses . . . there is no fault in that you eat all together, or in groups sepa- rately.' " The theme of the places where food is eaten and the way in which it was served seems to be a general theme in this group of hadits. Each of the hadits suggests that food can be eaten anywhere. Whether such a position is being made against any particular eating conventions in the pre-Islamic era, or in al-Buhârïs own milieu, is difficult to say. 75 For a discussion of the preference for the right in Islam, see Joseph Chelhod, "Contribu- tion au problème de la prééminence de la droite, d'après le témoignage arabe", Anthropos , 59 (1964), p. 529-45; for this phemonenon in religious traditions more generally, see R. Hertz, "La prééminence de la main droite: étude sur la polarité religieuse", RP , 68 (1909), p. 553-80. 76 Sawïq is made from barley and traditionally taken on journeys, see David Waines, "Cereals, Bread and Society: An Essay on the Staff of Life in Medieval Iraq", JESHO, 30 (1987), p. 282-3 or id. y "Sawïk", EP. 77 There does not appear to be a connection between meal taken at al-Sahbâ' on the journey to Haybar (§12 &amp; 18) and the food given after the Prophet marriage to Safiyya (§15); however (B. 28; §53) states that wedding banquet also occurred al-Sahbã', which links the two narratives. 78 The thorn-tail lizard ( uromastix spinipes ) was a popular food, but some criticised people for eating. However, many collections, such as the Sahïhân emphasis its permissibility; see L. Kopf, "Dabb", EP. 79 This is a common discussion; for example, Muslim devotes a chapter to this topic: K. al-Sayd, B. 7 (. Bãb ibãhat al-dabb) . 80 See Waines, "Cereals, Bread and Society", p. 265 and Ch. Pellat, 'Khubz , EP . 81 Kor 24, 61.</page><page sequence="25">1 92 S. R. Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 After the repetition of the roasted lizard report (§19), there is a shift in focus of the Hadit (D: B. 11-12; §20-25). This group includes variants of the same hadit , in which the Prophet states that believers eat with one intes- tine and the polytheists eat with seven.82 The theme of greed has very little to do with the hadits that both precede and follow it - marking it as a discrete group. This is followed by another short group of two hadits (E: B. 13; §26-27) which state the Prophet did not eat whilst leaning down. This is a return to the theme of table manners, seen in the second group (§4-1 1). This suggests that there is a larger section, covering chapters 2-13 (§4-27) which are con- cerned with the general theme of manners and the ethics of eating. The hadits are framed through the repetition of ideas about manners and the majority of the hadits in this section can be viewed in this context. Section 3 - Specific Foods (B. 14-50; §28-82) It is not until the twenty-eighth hadit that specific food stuffs begin to be mentioned with any frequency. Within this larger section there are some important groups of hadits. The first group (F: B. 14-23, §28-44) does not appear to have general theme, and the hadits outline different foodstuffs that the Prophet did or did not eat. Within this group, there are some small sections, such as one ( В . 18-23; §32-36) which is concerned with the permissibility of eating meat off the bone. All of the hadits in this small unit appear to focus on one particular journey, during which the Prophet ate some lamb off the bone and then per- formed the prayers without ablutions. The full narrative is provided in §35, with the other hadits surrounding it presenting shorter sections of the matn. The next main group (G: B. 24-32; §48-60) discusses the symbolism of food, both as an allegory of the qualities of individual people (such as 'Ä'isa in §46 &amp; 47) or the believers (§55) and the role of food in ritual and spiritual action, e.g. porridge ( udm ) is given to the hungry as an act of charity by a slave-girl after her emancipation (§58); the Prophets family fasted after his death (§51). The next two sections focus on particular two foodstuffs, the first (H: B. 33-37; 61-66) on gourd ( al-dubba ) and the second (I: B. 38-47; §67-78) on dates of various kinds.83 The hadits in the final group in this sec- tion (J: B. 48-50; §79-82) do not seem to have much in common. 82 This theme is particularly important in Sufism, cf. al-Gazâlï, К. Riyãdat al-nafi , in Ihya ulùm al-diriy tr. Tim Winter, On Disciplining the Soul , Cambridge, Islamic Texts Society, 1995. 83 See also F. Viré, "Nakhl", EI2.</page><page sequence="26">5. R. Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 93 Section 4 - The End of the Meal (Ä 51-58; §83-96) The last major section of the kitãb is concerned with behaviour after the meal and can be divided into three short groups. The first concerns ablutions after eating (K: B. 51-53; §83-86), the second instructs the Muslim community to give thanks to God after eating (L: B. 54-57; §87-91) and the penultimate group (M: B. 58; §92-95) states that Muslims should finish eating if they hear the idãn during their dinner. The final chapter and hadït (N: B. 59; §96) is the most problematic and confusing, as the matn has very little to do with food - in fact the only con- nection with food or eating is that it briefly mentions a wedding feast to cel- ebrate the Prophet s marriage to Zaynab bt. Gahš.84 It will be useful to include a translation of this hadït: ... on the authority of Ibn Sihãb, that Anas used to say: "I am more knowledge- able than other people about the veil. Ubay b. Ka b used to ask me about it. When the Messenger of God got up, when he became the bridegroom of Zaynab bt. Gahš - he married her in Medina - he invited people to dine, when the sun had risen. The Messenger of God sat down, and people remained sitting with him after a group had left. Then the Messenger of God stood up, and walked away, and I walked with him, until he reached the door of 'Ä'isa's room; then, thinking that they would have left, I returned with him, but they were still sit- ting in the places, so he returned and I returned with him a second time, until he reached the door of Lisa's room, then he returned and I returned with him to see that the people had got up. Then he hung a curtain (sitr) between me and him, and the verse of the veil was sent down". Muslim includes this hadït , quite logically, in his Kitãb al-Nikãhbb - what is it doing in al-Buharls K. al-Afimai Its inclusion in the kitãb by al-Buhãrl is only made clear by the title of the chapter: Bãb qawl Allãh ta ãla : fa-idã tdimtum fa-ntasirü (Chapter on the Words of God, Most High: "...when you have had the meal, disperse").86 This hadït does not seem to be particu- larly relevant to the chapter or the kitãb&gt; but al-Buhãrl makes it so, with an appropriate title. 84 Zaynab bt. Gahš was the divorced wife of Muhammad's adopted, and later repudiated, son Zayd b. Hãrita/Zayd b. Muhammad; for a lengthy discussion of this marriage, see David S. Powers, Muhammad is Not the Father of Any of Your Men: The Making of the Last Prophet , Phila- delphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, p. 35-72. 85 Muslim, К al-Nikãh , in Sahih, B. Zawãg Zaynab bint Gahš wa-nuzül al-higãb wa-itbãt walimat al- urs' IV, p. 148-9. 86 Kor 33, 53; Muhammads marriage to Zaynab and his repudiation of Zayd are closely associated with this süra.</page><page sequence="27">1 94 5. R. Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 Comments &amp; Analysis The general structure of the Kitãb al-Atima outlines the course of eating a meal, beginning with how one should behave before eating and ending with what should be done at the end of the meal.87 There are four main sections in the Kitãb which can be divided in to a further fourteen smaller units: some of which have a specific theme, others have a looser association. The following table outlines the structure of the Kitãb : Group Theme Abwãb No. hadït(s) hadït{s) 1 A Ethics of Food: 1 3 1-3 5373-5374 Feeding the Poor 2 В Manners 2-6 9 4-11 5376-5383 С Eating Anywhere 6-10 11 12-19 5384-5391 D Greed 11-12 6 20-25 5392-5397 E Manners 13 2 26-27 5398-5399 3 F What the Prophet Ate 14-23 18 28-45 5400-5416 G Allegorical and Ritual 24-32 15 46-61 5417-5432 Food H Gourd 33-37 6 62-67 5433-5438 I Dates 38-47 1 1 68-78 5439-5449 J Various 48-50 4 79-82 5450-5453 4 К Ablutions after eating 51-53 4 83-86 5454-5457 L Prayers said after 54-57 5 87-91 5458-5461 eating M Eating when the idãn 58 4 92-95 5462-5465 is called N Dispersal after dining 59 1 96 5466 The first section highlights the main theme of the chapter - the ethics of food, but also allows a logical progression from the previous Kitãb al-Nafaqãt ( The Chapter on Supporting Others). Likewise the strong focus on the relationship between eating and celebration - in this case the marriage of the Prophet of Zaynab bt. čahš - in the last section of the Kitãb al-Atima flows nicely into the subsequent kutub {Kitãb al-Aqïqa and Kitãb al-Dabaih wa-l-sayd) which include the use of food in ritual and celebratory events. This suggests that 87 This structure is also found in al-Gazãlí s К Àdãb al-akl, in Ihya.</page><page sequence="28">S. R. Bürge I Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 195 al-Buhãrl arranged his Salpilo in a careful and thoughtful way and that it the work could be read and not simply used as an encyclopaedia. There are some intriguing aspects of the arrangement of the Hadit in indi- vidual abwäb. Such, sometimes odd, arrangements of Hadit can been seen par- ticularly clearly in B. 23 - Mã kãna l-nabi wa-ashãbuhu ydkulüna (What the Prophet and his companions used to eat). The chapter contains six hadits : § Précis of the Matn 39 lhe Prophet distributes seven dates to his companions 40 Early converts only had the leaves of the habala tree to eat; their stool is similar to sheeps stool 4 1 Barley flour was not sifted, but one can blow off the husks88 42 The Prophet declined to eat roasted sheep; he never satisfied his hunger 43 The Prophet never ate from a dinner table, on small plates or from thin bread 44 The Prophet never satisfied his hunger, not even with barley bread The way in which these hadits have been arranged seems to be quite random; but, on closer inspection, there does appear to be an underlying logic to their order. The first hadit (§39) outlines the eating of a luxury food {dates) , which leads to the description of the opposite, a food eaten in dire circumstances (§40); the remaining four hadits allude to the Prophets abstinence from eat- ing greedily and with lavishness, moving the material from a time of famine and involuntary abstinence to an ethic of voluntary abstinence in times of plenty. The hadits also present links to one another: sheep (§40 &amp; 42); barley bread (§41, 43 &amp; 44) ;89 not satisfying hunger (§42 &amp; 44); food of plenty and food of famine (§39 &amp; 40). This shows that al-Buhãrl is making connections between hadits within his individual chapters. The hadits within each bãb , and also within the kitãb as a whole, are highly interconnected. This allows the chapter and the book to be read more easily and offers a sense of familiar- ity with the material. It certainly reveals the way in which al-Buhãrl is able to manipulate data to make his collection easier for someone to read and for him to convey his ethical message. 88 Al-Gazalï notes that the sieve was introduced after the death of the Prophet; al-Gazâlï, tr. Johnson-Davies, On the Manners of Eating, p. 4-5. 89 For more on the use of bread in the early Muslim community, see Waines, "Cereals, Bread and Society", p. 263-72.</page><page sequence="29">1 96 5. R. Bürge / Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 Quite surprisingly, the chapter has very little to do with which foods are permissible or impermissible to eat. Section 3 does outline some foods that the Prophet did or did not eat, but this kitäb is not particularly concerned with legal aspects of food, so much so that this chapter would prove com- pletely inadequate for a jurist. The kitãb bears little resemblance to the way in which this material is dealt with in other canonical collections and works of fiqh. This is important as it highlights the approach that al-Buhârï takes to this chapter, and possibly to the Sahih as a whole. General Conclusions Although Hadït collections are not normally understood in terms of litera- ture, the way in which they are compiled and arranged does suggest that they can be judged in these terms. Understanding the way in which hadïts are compiled and organised allows the possibility of understanding the underly- ing viewpoint and theology of the compiler themselves. As Hadït collections are not literary in it its full sense (because they have no influence over the information included in the matn ), the only way in which a compiler can convey a message is through the organisation and structuring of the work. It is often the case that the only way one can hear the authorial voice in a Hadït collection is through an analysis of the way in which the compiler has arranged and constructed the text. It is necessary to read 'between the lines' to gain an insight into the compilers point of view. In the case of al-Buhãrls Kitãb Bad ' al-wahy , analysis of its structure has revealed an underlying message. This chapter is not one of the problematic' chapters of his Sahih , and the hadïts are all, for want of a better word, com- pletely orthodox. Their arrangement, however, is definitely unorthodox; a fact seen particularly clearly when it is compared with Muslims own organi- sation of a similar chapter. Al-Buhãrl skilfully uses Hadït placement in this chapter to aid its reading, but, also, to make the reader interpret these hadïts in a specific way; namely that Muhammad continued a line of Judeo-Chris- tian prophecy, which was authenticated by Muslims, Jews and Christians. This use of placement can also be seen in the second case study, which, after analysis, reveals an overarching structure, with the Hadït providing information about the start of a meal to its end. Al-Buharl takes his reader through this meal, highlighting the ethics of eating along the way. It is this sense of eating ethically that pervades the kitãb y and it is not concerned with the details of which foods are permissible. This is also seen by the kitãtís placement directly after a chapter dealing with supporting members of the</page><page sequence="30">5. Я Bürge /Arabica 58 (2011) 168-197 1 97 community. The Kitãb al-Atima appears quite innocuous, as though it has been put together with little consideration; however, further analysis shows that there is an overarching structure to the kitãb and that there is a theological viewpoint being proposed. Al-Buhârï gently nudges his reader into a particu- lar direction - and it is in this way that he establishes his opinions in the mind of the reader. Both canonical and redaction criticism offer a means for exploring the way in which Hadït collections were shaped, and the reasons behind the choices that compilers make. It is possible to ask questions posed by these critical methods of the Bible to the compilation of Hadït . They cannot simply be transferred to Hadït , but the way in which they approach Biblical texts pro- vide an interesting basis from which to begin to explore the ways in which hadïts are arranged. Another important aspect, is that these methods do not ask questions about the historicity, authenticity or source of the text, prefer- ring to discuss a text on its own terms. This makes these two methodological approaches useful for the study of both Hadït and Hadït collections, and would, hopefully, allow the study to develop new ways of approaching hadïts and their compilation. Such compilation criticism provides a useful tool to examine the different ways in which hadïts interact with others in a broader context, revealing the intentions of compilers, their own worldviews and their authorial voice.</page></plain_text>
