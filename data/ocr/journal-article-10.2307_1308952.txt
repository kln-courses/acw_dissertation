<plain_text><page sequence="1">SALTBUSH PHYSIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Physiological Processes in Plant Ecology: Toward a Synthesis with Atriplex, by C. B. Osmond, C. Bjorkman, and D. J. Anderson. Springer-Verlag, NY, 1980, 468 p., illus., $49.80. This book will be of interest to a wide range of plant scientists because it deals with every aspect of the botany of Atriplex. It is unique for several reasons. It probably is the most extensive and, at the same time, the most intensive study ever made of the physiology and ecology of a genus, and it represents the successful cooperative efforts of three plant scientists with unusually broad interests, plus the advice of many of their colleagues. Al- though Atriplex is a large genus on which to attempt such a synthesis, its morphology and physiology have been studied extensively. It grows on every continent, and although it is most important in arid regions, it is found in habitats ranging from cool, humid, coastal regions to hot, dry deserts. Its species vary in habit of growth from small herbaceous annu- als to large woody perennials. The leaves of some species possess the "Kranz" anatomy characteristic of plants using the C4 carbon pathway while others lack it and use the C3 pathway. Some species exclude salt, others dispose of it through salt glands; some are hirsute; others are not. Another unique feature of the book is the authors' attempt to develop a basic philoso- phy using a space-time scale based on mi- crons and seconds and an analysis of informa- tion in terms of "states" and "processes." The authors describe a state description as an analysis of the number and distribution of units, ranging from molecules to organisms, in larger units ranging from cells to ecosystems. Processes refer to the redistribution of units between states. Thus, the "state" is a space description, while "processes" involve the description of changing state through time. This view, presented in chapter 1, deserves and requires careful reading. It is impossible to deal in detail with the contents of this book. It contains chapters on the systematics and geographic distribution of Atriplex, genecological differentiation, genet- ic and evolutionary relationships, and an anal- ysis of Atriplex communities. Then come chapters on seed germination and seedling establishment, absorption of ions, water rela- tions, and photosynthesis. The chapter on photosynthesis emphasizes environmental and biological control of the process in rela- tion to the performance of Atriplex in natural habitats. This leads to a chapter on productiv- ity in relation to the environment in which the authors bring together a great deal of data from experiments conducted by the Carnegie Institution Laboratory at Stanford as well as from other sources. Although they start this chapter with the assumption that develop- ment of maximum photosynthetic capacity is central to survival, at the end, they seem to agree with Caldwell that development of max- imum productivity is not by itself essential for survival. The book concludes with an epilog restating the original concepts of "state" and "process," discussing the role of physiology in ecology and the need for experimental evidence for adaptations. It is well written and well illustrated with graphs and tables, and many topics are discussed in depth. The chapter on photosynthesis contains an excel- lent discussion of the effects of environmental stresses on the process. No doubt individual readers will find points to criticize. For exam- ple, this reader objects to anthropomorphic expressions such as, "... speculation as to the goals of the games plants play..." Plants do not have goals, although scientists sometimes retrospectively attribute goals to them. However, overall, this is a very successful synthesis and an important contribution to ecology and environmental physiology. PAUL J.
