Landscapes, places and geographic spaces: Texts of Beatrix Potter as cultural communication Squire, Shelagh J., Dr., Department of Geography, Carleton University, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1S 5B6 Abstract: This paper highlights connections between literature, culture and society. As a form of cultural communication, literature may shape social relationships and foster particular landscape meanings, attitudes and values. Thus, taking the example of juvenile fiction, specifically Beatrix Potter's illustrated anthropomorphic stories, links between literary images and cultural meanings and practises are explored. Texts of place' are encountered in diverse ways; not least through literary tourism. In considering such aspects of reader response, processes of textual appropriation and transformation are also scrutinized. Finally, in assessing the research interface between geography and literature, the paper raises questions about context, textual interpretation, and written and visual narratives. Philo 1991; Anderson and Gale 1992). From such perspectives, I argue that literature may also shape how cultural meanings and attendant social relation- ships are experienced, understood and construed. Specifically, literature is a social construct; a vehicle through which both writers and diverse readers negotiate meanings and values for places. In this context, I begin by identifying briefly some of the ways that geographers have approached literary sources, highlighting their pervasive neglect of 'popular' fiction generally and children's litera- ture in particular. Correspondingly, I consider theo- retical questions, sketching links between research on geography and literature, and social and cultural studies analyses. Then, taking Beatrix Potter's stories as a specific case example, I assess how literary images of place may mediate, in practise, certain cultural attitudes and values. Finally, in conclusion I raise broader questions about cultural communication and texts of place, focusing on links between evolving theoretical perspectives, and the research interface between geography and literature. 'Literary' geography: Scope and synthesis In considering literary texts, geographers have employed various approaches. As Wright, for instance, noted in an early statement: some 'writers . . . have trained themselves to visualize even more clearly than the professional geographer those regional aspects of the earth's surface most signifi- Introduction Literature often serves, and indeed may explicitly be defined as a medium of cultural communication. At diverse scales and contexts, a people's literary canon is integral to individual and collective identity, and is a source of symbolism, self-determination, and regional or national pride. Much literary communi- cation is facilitated by, if not actively premised upon, images of place and landscape. Thus, there is an inherent geography to many literary texts and, cor- respondingly, such geographic representations may both foster, and help to perpetuate a range of cultur- ally defined meanings, attitudes and values. In this paper, I argue that it is essential for geog- raphers to explore further links between literary images, and cultural meanings, values and commu- nication. As Lowenthal and Prince commented in one of the earliest geographic musings on this theme: 'the English seldom merely see a landscape. They see it as delineated in famous books and paintings' (Lowenthal and Prince 1965: 215). It must be empha- sized, however, that not only 'official' or 'classic' literatures are instrumental in shaping, or mediating culturally constructed attitudes and 'ways of seeing' particular geographic spaces. 'Popular' fiction, including that written for children, may also influ- ence how landscapes come to be interpreted and, in certain cases, their meanings re-defined. Recent work by social and cultural geographers has focused on questions of cultural meaning and communication (see, for example, Cosgrove 1989;</page><page sequence="2">76 cant to the general run of humanity' (Wright 1924: 659). Perhaps not surprisingly, then, regional litera- ture has been widely studied, both as a medium capturing individual environmental experiences, and as a form of geographic narrative providing source material for studies of landscapes and places. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s, however, and the emergence of humanistic perspectives, that literary depictions of landscapes and places were widely incorporated into geographic analyses. Links between geography and literature have been expressed in sundry ways. Some work, for instance, culls geographic details from fictional sources, assessing how authors represented particular locales in their work (selected examples include Aiken 1977, 1979, 1981; Jay 1975; Salter and Lloyd 1977; Withers 1984). Other geographers have interpreted creative literature as an expression of individuals' multi-facetted, often subliminal associations with landscapes and places (see, for example, Lanegran and Toth 1976; Salter and Lloyd 1977; Tuan 1974, 1976, 1978; Seamon 1976). And, centred around inter-twined notions of 'place' and 'place creation', a range of research has invoked literature to assess landscape symbolism, and relationships between landscape and human personality (Pocock 1981, 1986, 1988; Porteous 1986). Indeed, as Pocock (1986: 56) contended: 'the geographer's engagement in literature is, and has been, for various ends but humanist geographers so engage in an attempt to understand the nature of human experience as lived out in a meaningful world.' Although humanistic perspectives have tended to dominate the research interface between geography and literature (Mallory and Simpson-Housley 1988; Porteous 1985, 1986, 1987; Herbert 1991), these agendas have also been criticized. In many human- istically oriented analysis, grounds for textual inter- pretation have rarely been made explicit and, until recently, there has seldom been rigorous scrutiny of the social, cultural and political contexts within which texts are created and interpreted (Thrift 1978; Silk 1984; Daniels 1985). Furthermore, geographers drawing upon literature have tended to focus pri- marily on 'classic' works, ignoring more mass market, popular, and non-adult texts. Such critiques notwithstanding, however, this genre of humanistic research has been significant and influential; not least because in its focus on sense of place it continues to draw attention to human- environmental experiences in previously overlooked ways. Specifically, humanistic approaches have raised questions about the role of the individual vis- à-vis place, and literature plays a part in that process. As expressed via literature, however, interactions between people and places encompass both writers and readers. Thus, literature may function as a channel of cultural communication. Links between literature, culture and society, and the contexts within which production and consumption of literary texts occurs, have rarely been embraced by humanistic positions. Integrated into human geography and, in particular, research on geography and literature, insights from cultural studies and social theory suggest possible new directions and ways forward. Literature, culture and society In engaging with interdisciplinary social theory and cultural studies, human geographers are re-evaluating interpretations of culture, landscape and society. Much recent research has focused on culture as concerned with meanings and ideas, and as an expression of social practises and communication (Hall 1986: 35). These conceptualizations embrace diverse forms of cultural expression: not only elite or official views, but vernacular and popular cultures too. In geography, such perspectives have shaped critiques and assessments of other traditions (see, for example Blaut 1980; Jackson 1980; Cosgrove and Jackson 1987; Gregory and Ley 1988; Cosgrove 1990, 1992). They have also influenced a diversity of empirical research, frequently concerned with cultural politics and contested meanings, often in urban contexts (see, for example, Ley 1987; Mills 1988, 1991; Duncan 1992; Jacobs 1992; Winchester 1992). In the process, however, much attention has focused on ideas of landscape, invoking textual metaphors to explore the social relationships and political ideologies underlying ways of seeing both 'natural', and 'built' environments (Duncan and Duncan 1988; Cosgrove 1984, 1986; Cosgrove and Daniels 1988). Cultural agendas have influenced research ques- tions in many areas of human geography; geography and literature included (see, for example, Thrift 1978, 1983; Silk and Silk 1985; Daniels 1985; Osborne 1988). Indeed, as Osborne (1988: 268) argued: 'It is crucial for geographers to move beyond explicitly humanistic approaches, to recognize literary texts as 'constitutive of social relations and complex symbolic systems.' In turn, such perspectives raise questions about differential readings and communi- cation. Silk (1984: 172) explains: 'it is difficult to argue what a particular text should be taken to mean, unless something is known about who currently reads it and how it is to be read.' In other words, literary meanings are not fixed. Once texts are created, their meanings are inevitably transformed by readers whose interpretations will be influenced by such varied factors as space, time, age, social class and gender. This relationship between authors, texts and readers has been scrutinized outside geography (see, for example, Jakobson 1960; Johnson 1986), but amongst geographers working with literature, ques-</page><page sequence="3">tions of textual consumption and cultural communi- cation have gone virtually unexplored. Such ques- tions, however, are vital for it is in this way that literature becomes part of larger symbolic systems and cultural frameworks. From this stance, popular writings must be con- sidered as, if not more significant than so-called 'classic' texts. Popular fiction usually reaches a wider audience than other literary forms and textual meanings enter more easily into vernacular culture (Lowenthal 1982; Tuan 1985). My focus here is on a particular genre of 'popular' writing; that intended for children. Juvenile literature can communicate cultural values, attitudes and expectations but its social and cultural implications have frequently been neglected. As Hunt (1991: 6) comments: 'to the academic, children's literature is a non-subject. Its very subject-matter seems to disqualify it from serious adult consideration; after all, it is simple, ephemeral, popular, and designed for an immature audience.' From a cultural studies perspective, however, these conventional points of criticism are, in fact, strengths. It must be emphasized that because such literature is written by adults for children, its 'simplistic' and 'ephemeral' form can be a potent medium through which a range of adult values and conventions are communicated and, by extension, perpetuated. In one of the few geographic assessments of children's lit- erature, Loyd (1974) considered changing urban landscapes in children's books. She identified how such changes reveal the landscape images of adults, as well as 'how much the political and social climate of the country' shapes the landscape representations we give our'children (Loyd 1974: 19). Brooker-Gross (1981) made a similar point. Highlighting patterns of landscape description in the Nancy Drew mystery stories, Brooker-Gross drew parallels between such depictions, and the social values of American middle class society. As she concluded: 'the use of landscape [in the Nancy Drew books] constitutes a sort of tutelage in moral geography;' romantic and pastoral images symbolize virtue while dirt and decay suggest crime (Brooker-Gross 1981: 63). Thus, as much as they may be negotiated and re- defined by adult reading, landscape attitudes do not suddenly emerge in adulthood. Rather, notions of both childhood and landscape are imbued with a variety of socially constructed meanings and values, some of which may be conveyed through children's fiction (Williams 1973; Lowenthal 1985). Not only do children's stories offer a means of recapturing childhood places and experiences; they are also a form of cultural communication, mediating links between individuals, cultures and societies. All literary texts must be seen as cultural products embedded in the material contexts within which they are created and interpreted. Yet, by geographers at least, the meanings and representational systems 77 associated with such texts, and children's fiction in particular, remain virtually unexplored. In developing these arguments further, I now draw on a specific case study, Beatrix Potter's illustrated stories, to assess empirically, theoretical connections between texts, contexts and cultural communication. Beatrix Potter's England Associations between authors and regions have a long history and, in the British context at least, have been well documented elsewhere (Daiches and Flower 1979; Drabble 1987; Ousby 1991). Shakespeare's Stratford, for example, has been cel- ebrated since the eighteenth century and Hardy's 'Wessex,' Wordsworth's Lake District, and the Bronte's Yorkshire are also widely recognized. Yet, while these might be defined as 'key' sites on a literary pilgrim's perceptual map of Britain, what influences are exerted by more popular writings - those of romantic novelist Catherine Cookson, for instance, or A. A. Milne's tales of 'Winnie the Pooh'? In describing places, all writers, whether inten- tionally or unconsciously, serve as cultural brokers, appropriating a landscape and its people and re-inter- preting them for new audiences. Such tendencies are often pronounced in children's fiction. English children's literature is replete with geographic references and associations. These texts have com- memorated both epic and everyday events and, correspondingly, have highlighted diverse aspects of individual and collective environmental experiences. Here, I use the example of children's writer and illustrator Beatrix Potter (1866-1943) to consider some of these underlying links between writers, texts and places, and between literature and landscape meanings and values. Potter was born in London but she continues to gain international recognition for her anthropo- morphic stories celebrating English rural life and landscape. Much of her work was inspired by the Lake District where, as a young adult she spent numerous family holidays. Following early literary successes like The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902), Potter bought a farm property, Hill Top, in the Lake District village of Near Sawrey (Figure 1). Although she never lived permanently at Hill Top, it was an emotional refuge and important creative stimulus. As Battrick (1987a: 178) suggests: 'However short the visits, it was at Hill Top that Beatrix [Potter] found her real world. . . . She copied the way of life she gave her animals from what she saw around her. . . . The books and the life and landscape of the Lake District merged together.' Although most of Potter's creative work was completed before 1913, it is easy, even today, to connect fictional representations with reality. Such parallels reflect, in large part, her tireless work for</page><page sequence="4">78 Figure 1. United Kingdom location map. Lake District preservation. Until her death in 1943, Beatrix Potter was active in the National Trust, an organization founded in 1895 to ensure the 'preser- vation of places of historic interest or natural beauty in England, Wales and Northern Ireland' {National Trust Handbook 1991: 5). In supporting the Trust's work, she not only made regular financial contribu- tions to their Lake District appeals, but as royalty earnings from her books and related products (china and toys, for example) increased, she also purchased farm and estate properties. After 1913, when Potter married a local solicitor and lived in the Lake District year-round, she became almost entirely absorbed with farming activities and countryside conservation issues. Ultimately, she bequeathed all of her Lake District land holdings to the National Trust. As Battrick (1987b: 204) explains: Beatrix Potter 'understood that Lake District countryside could only survive if the traditional way of life survived with it, farms and farming in particular/ This way of life was captured in Potter's illus- trated stories. Still in the care of the National Trust today, the places that she drew and wrote about attract visitors from around the world. The range of consumer merchandise inspired by her books con- tinues to expand, and characters, settings, and narra- tive have been incorporated into products including stationary supplies, clothing, china, jewellery, home furnishings, and toiletries. And, not least, literary allusions are featured regularly in other media: polit- ical cartoons, romantic novels and consumer adver- tising to cite but a few (Taylor 1988; Cooper 1988; Morse 1991). In this way, then, literary meanings continue to be appropriated into new contexts and, in the process, transformed. Reading 'texts' of place This transformation of literary meanings cannot be divorced from other writing about children's litera- ture and development of a body of critical theory concerned with juvenile fiction. This work is of relatively recent origin (see, for example, Rose 1984;</page><page sequence="5">Summerfield 1984; Paul 1987; Hunt 1990, 1991) but continuing analyses focus on questions of 'politics and power, reader response, and deconstruction, structures, and myths' (Hunt 1991: 10-11). Linked with the theoretical strands influencing cultural and social geography noted above, such perspectives also facilitate consideration of Potter's texts; particularly representations of landscape, place and region in her work. As I argue here, children's literature can function as a form of popular cultural expression and com- munication. Beatrix Potter is thus a case example of a literary figure whose writings and images resonate strongly in contemporary cultural life. Although her cultural significance can be assessed from diverse perspectives. I look first at pastoral meanings asso- ciated with her work. Beatrix Potter's texts embrace a pastoral tradition celebrating country life and childhood which, emerging from late eighteenth and early nineteenth century Romanticism, persists albeit in altered forms today. The Romantics introduced children into English literature and, between 1860 and 1930 there was tremendous growth in the field of juvenile writing. This literature both reflected and responded to changing social, political and economic circum- stances. First, a new audience for children's books had emerged: the children of the monied middle classes. And second, nineteenth century Britain was an age of high imperialism and empire building. National power, however, was fuelled by an indus- trial revolution that was blighting rural areas, and creating misery and oppression for large numbers of the working class. Children's literature expressed this context of rapid social change in two ways: via the adventure or school story, encouraging nationalistic heroism, and through fantasy or escapist arcadian literature (Carpenter 1985; Cadogan and Craig 1976). It is to this latter tradition that Potter's illustrated stories belong. The 'pastoral' carries diverse meanings and it is not my purpose here to focus on the complex history and implications of its use (see Mannelli 1971; Loughrey 1984; Williams 1982). Rather, I want to highlight how a particular understanding of the 'pastoral' is essential to a critical assessment of Beatrix Potter's texts of place. In Potter's stories, pastoral themes are conveyed through ordinary country landscapes. These settings are coloured by nostalgia for a particular way of life; one linked with attitudes about rurality and childhood experience. Yet, Beatrix Potter's books are not con- ventional pastoral idylls for she 'used the arcadian setting as an ironic contrast and background to the blackly comic themes of her stories' (Carpenter 1985: 11). Further, her texts also reflect a range of other influences: Aesop's animal fables and related anthro- pomorphic traditions, and a number of earlier Victorian animal painters and illustrators including 79 Caldecott, Landseer and the Pre-Raphaelites (Whalley 1987; Whalley and Hobbs 1987; Lambourne 1989; Feaver 1977; Maas 1988; Staley 1973). Such influences notwithstanding, though, Potter's work has become widely associated with pastoral images and traditions. As such, it is impor- tant to consider how such impressions of landscape and place are conveyed. Potter's tales share particular pastoral motifs that help to foster and perpetuate certain images or myths of rural life. Garden imagery pervades her books. Peter Rabbit trespasses in Mr. McGregor's garden (1902), and this setting is also featured in The Tale of Benjamin Bunny (1904) and the Flopsy Bunnies (1909). Gardens are celebrated in the Hill Top Farm books too including The Tale of the Pie and the Patty -Pan (1905). Tom Kitten (1907) and The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918). Textual narrative and accompanying illustrations serve to accent a number of garden elements in these books such as the vegetable and flower mixtures typifying traditional English cottage gardens and stone walls, gates, and smaller birds and animals - sparrows, robins and mice (Russell 1989). One of the best examples of this imagery comes from the story of Johnny Town-Mouse and his friend Timmy Willie, a country mouse 'who went to town by mistake in a hamper' (Potter 1989: 319). When Johnny asks about country life, Timmy Willie proffers the following description: . . . When the sun comes out ... you should see my garden and the flowers - roses and pinks and pansies - no noise except the birds and bees, and the lambs in the meadows' (Potter 1989: 325). This excerpt encompasses various pastoral allusions. The profusion of flowers, images of peace and tran- quillity, and the reference to lambs and meadows reinforce a particular way of seeing rural landscapes. As Marx (1967: 85) who also cites the garden motif to explore ideas of the pastoral comments: 'the garden stands for the original unity ... the beauty ... of creation' and has been associated with a number of positive connotations. Indeed, although danger may lurk just outside or even within the pastoral setting, gardens represent a compelling utopia. And, in this sense, the notion of barriers is particularly important because as noted, the gardens in Potter's stories usually incorporate a wall or gate. Such features serve important symbolic functions, effectively separating different kinds of geographic spaces and places. In writing about gardens and rural life, however, Beatrix Potter was, in a larger context, also juxtaposing country and city settings in signifi- cant ways. Sometimes, she explicitly defined rural and urban experiences in relation to each other. In her own life, Potter turned her back on London, consciously choosing to live in the rural Lake</page><page sequence="6">80 District. She reiterated this resolution in The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse saying: 'One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie' (Potter 1989: 330). When the exception of The Tailor of Gloucester, all of Beatrix Potter's best known stories celebrate rural virtues and, correspondingly, contribute to a still powerful myth of English country life. The cosy cottage interiors and farmyard scenes depicted in books like The Pie and the Patty-Pan, Tom Kitten, Samuel Whiskers and The Tale of Jemima Puddle- Duck, highlight how in carefully transferring the Hill Top setting into her work, Potter also captured a way of life; one that never actually existed as she por- trayed it, but which nevertheless evokes idealized pastoral myths. Although I do not want to delve into the realm of semiotics, such notions of myth are important because they reflect a second level of signification (Barthes 1972). Simply put, myth draws its substance from a pre-existing system of meanings. From this perspective, then, Potter's work speaks to a much larger sphere of rural images and mythologies, encompassed by but in no way unique to the specific geographic settings from which her texts derive. As Treble (1981: 169) claims, drawing parallels between Victorian and more contemporary landscape tastes: One of the most powerful images of the Victorian countryside for the modern viewer, and for the Victorians themselves, was provided by scenes of cottage life, featuring rustic simplicity. . . . This prettily sentimental view of country life was almost as mythical to its contemporaries as it is to the twentieth century and seems to have owed its popularity as much to its unattainability as to the evident charm of the paintings it produced. This charm contributes to Potter's still powerful appeal for her landscapes show few unpleasant real- ities of rural life. One way of identifying this pastoral imagery, then, is to scrutinize Potter's texts more closely, assessing what has been omitted from her representations of landscape and place. Barrell (1980) took this approach in considering English landscape paintings, highlighting the darker lives of the rural poor under- lying seemingly innocuous, and picturesque por- trayals of rural scenes. In terms of both narrative and illustration, Potter's stories can be interpreted in a similar way. The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck, for instance, is partially set in the farmyard at Hill Top. Yet, none of the more untidy aspects of rural life or agricultural labour intrude upon the storybook setting. Similarly, there is no hint from the pretty village scenes in books like The Pie and the Patty- Pan and Ginger and Pickles that in a neighbouring community, Hawkshead, a county sanitary inspector was then preparing a report devoted to problems of disease and over-crowding in cottage homes (Denyer 1989). In Beatrix Potter's stories, summer-like, and gently pastoral scenes prevail. It must be emphasized, however, that while Potter was completing most of this work farming remained a hobby and she expe- rienced Lake District village life as a holiday visitor. Despite their obvious charm, there is thus a certain indulgent quality to her illustrated texts. Farming was not her livelihood, and Hill Top was an emotional refuge from domestic concerns. Since she was not obliged to confront directly any darker realities of rural life, she must have found it relatively easy to sustain pastoral images and allusions in her work. After her marriage, though, when she became a full- time farmer, her outlook shifted. In a letter to a friend she explained: 'Somehow when one is up to the eyes in work with real animals it makes one despise paper-book animals' (cited in Taylor 1988: 144). Marsh (1982) traces how Victorian pastoral impulses were expressed in various 'back to the land' movements. Although Beatrix Potter was not part of any formal organization, her 'escape' from London to the Lake District could undoubtedly be related to these larger societal trends. What I want to empha- size here, however, is that the pastoral remains a powerful cultural symbol 'often directing the way we look at our environment' (Peebles 1989: 1). It can thus be argued that part of the contemporary appeal of Potter's work reflects this orientation. Correspondingly, notions of the pastoral embrace ideas of childhood. Like countryside, childhood is a social and cultural construct; its meanings owing much to Romantic influences. Indeed, ideas of both childhood and countryside are closely fused for Wordsworth and his successors saw childhood as unequivocally rural (Squire 1988, 1990). Potter rarely incorporated human children into her stories. Still, her books were originally written for children, and today they have become indelibly associated with a particular version of childhood experience; one set in the rural past. This relationship between childhood and an ideal- ized golden age has been forged in part via adult nostalgia. As Lowenthal (1985: 8) explains: 'Life back then seems brighter not because things were better but because we lived more vividly when young; even the adult world of yesteryear reflects the perspective of childhood.' Potter has been incorpo- rated into this kind of nostalgia, and the pastoral images pervading her books cannot be separated from entrenched notions of an elusive childhood idyll. Nostalgia for pastoral childhood has today become part of middle-class culture and its attendant value system. Yet, it is important to question how Beatrix Potter's stories have been appropriated into these new contexts. In other words, inter-relationships between the writer, the texts and different consumers or audiences, become singularly important.</page><page sequence="7">Texts transformed Beatrix Potter is integral to notions of English cultural identity. Hunt (1991: 26), for example, describes the books as 'a national institution' and, as Margaret Drabble, a celebrated British novelist in her own right comments: 'generations of children all over the world, some of whom have never seen an English field or tree, have formed intense and acute impressions of the English countryside through [Potter's] work' (Drabble 1987: 256). Yet, like Winnie the Pooh and Paddington Bear, the Beatrix Potter characters are no longer uniquely literary types, and nor are meanings associated with the books exclusively a product of textual influences. The transformation of Potter's work into new contexts was noted briefly above, but I now want to develop these ideas further, focusing specifically on the intersection between textual transformation and cultural communication. Textual products In conjunction with writing and illustrating her stories, Potter was herself from an early stage, actively involved in developing book related mer- chandise - china, toys, games and so on (Taylor 1988). Since her death in 1943, the product-line inspired by the books has continued to expand and is now licensed and distributed worldwide. Correspondingly, new textual forms have been forged. In recent years, for instance, Ladybird Books has published new versions of several of Potter's stories, and literary inspired films and video drama- tisations have also been created. The Ladybird editions of Beatrix Potter's books are an interesting example of how textual meanings have been appropriated into new contexts and, in the process transformed. Like Potter, Ladybird Books are also something of a British institution having established a reputation for publishing children's 'classics' in rudimentary, easy to read formats. In the case of the Ladybird editions of Potter's books, the original narratives have been simplified and the illus- trations either re-drawn by other artists, or replaced with studio photographs of toy animals (Hamilton 1987). Although there is no formal evidence that these books have made Potter's original stories any less popular, the way that they have been revised for another market group raises questions about the meanings that readers make from books, and links between such meanings and a larger cultural context. Soon after publication of the Ladybird version of The Tale of Peter Rabbit (in 1987), the letters to the editor column in The Times newspaper chronicled a vigorous dialogue over cultural expression and com- munication. As one woman wrote: I am affronted ... by the news of a simplified 81 version of Peter Rabbit . . . For eighty-five years, children have read and enjoyed all Beatrix Potter's books, and when they were too young to read they simply looked at the author's beautiful line drawings. It is 'passing extraordinary' {The Tailor of Gloucester) that these pictures should be replaced by overweight and garish puppets . . . As the sparrows said to Peter Rabbit, 'I implore you to exert yourself and try to prevent 'this frightful thing' (Fox 1987). And as another Times reader commented: 'The age of dilettantism is gone. That of [public relations], economists, market research, and value for money has succeeded. . . . That must be why . . . Ladybird Books have updated Beatrix Potter to appeal to a wider non-book buying public' (Howard 1987). These extracts highlight how distinctions between 'elite' and 'popular' forms of cultural expression may be constructed and re-defined. Such distinctions are, of course, fluid but as conveyed via the preceding commentaries, they help to illustrate how literary meanings may become invested with larger social- cultural structures and value systems; in this case, as prescribed by social class, education and economic circumstance. From such perspectives, Potter's texts may also be related to critiques of culture in mass society (see, for example Leavis 1930; Swingewood 1985). In such critiques, the 'cultural' is often interpreted as the 'literary' and it is argued that cultural vitality is threatened by a 'profit-seeking capitalist mass media' (Swingewood 1985: 10). Thus, in contemporary culture, various social critics have identified a pro- gressive trend toward dehumanisation, fragmentation of community and, correspondingly, a crisis in values. Underlying such claims is a dialectic between high and mass culture which, in another form, also sustains some of the meanings associated with Potter's books and their appropriation into new contexts. Hunt (1991: 31) uses discussions of the Ladybird editions of Potter's stories to highlight this dialectic, contending that they illustrate a far simpler and cruder set of assumptions which infuse all discussion of children's books. These are that the Beatrix Potter 'original' edition supporters are elitist snobs, who think that old is good, per se. ... On the other side are those who would rather have children read anything . . . than nothing. They do not understand or care for the book-culture at all, and merely wish to appropriate it for their own subversive ends. In doing so, they . . . give in to the lowest common denominators of culture. This excerpt aptly synthesizes the aforementioned arguments about cultural expression and society and how ideas about high and mass culture may be</page><page sequence="8">82 invoked for different purposes. From an economic perspective, anything that extends Beatrix Potter's already substantial popularity must be good. Yet, issues of taste and how 'tastefulness' may be defined remain significant, and are perpetually negotiated by members of the reading public. As I have emphasized, the Ladybird editions of Beatrix Potter's books are not an isolated example of how literary meanings may be transformed when represented in other contexts. In the United States, where The Tale of Peter Rabbit has never been pro- tected by copyright legislation, other authors and illustrators have long exercised creative license. Not only do numerous editions of the Peter Rabbit story proliferate in the USA, but various writers have produced sequels to the book, developing images and narratives that Beatrix Potter could never have envisioned or intended. And, worldwide, the stories have also been adapted for other media: a ballet, an operetta and, most recently, a series of video anima- tions. As consumers encounter Beatrix Potter's texts in different ways, and via diverse media, literary heritage acquires a range of new connotations and associations. Thus, in the process, textual meanings can become part of a larger framework of cultural understanding and communication. Literary tourism Tourist travel to places celebrated for links with par- ticular books or authors offers another way of scrutinizing these relationships between texts and readers, and the cultural meanings and values that may accrue to a literary oeuvre. In the case of Potter, it is therefore useful to consider briefly how readers as tourists encountered literary place, and how the literary texts, appropriated into new contexts, were used to mediate a range of other cultural values and attitudes; many having little to do with Potter and/or the actual stories. In recent years, Beatrix Potter's popularity has increased dramatically. Prices for early editions of her books have soared, both book and non-book related merchandising continues to expand and, in the English Lake District, the places associated with her stories are the locus of a flourishing tourist industry. Beatrix Potter inspired tourism is centred at Hill Top Farm, a National Trust property in the Lake District village of Near Sawrey (Figure 1). For many years, Hill Top has been open to the public as a commem- orative museum. In the summer of 1990, 1 personally interviewed over 600 visitors at Hill Top, seeking to identify aspects of Potter's contemporary signifi- cance, and the cultural symbolism now attached to both texts and place. With a similar intent, I also convened small group discussions with a cross- section of international members of the Beatrix Potter Society, then meeting in the Lake District for a literary conference.1 While research methods, practise and results are discussed at length elsewhere (Squire 1994a, 1994b), I highlight briefly some key issues here, principally to integrate aforementioned ideas about textual creation, interpretation and cultural communication. Interest in Beatrix Potter is today embedded in a larger cultural context reflecting a particular ideology fostered first by the stories, and subsequently through their appropriation into other forms. Notions of class, gender, family life, and perceptions of rural and urban experiences help to sustain this ideology and for many adults, Potter's texts are a medium through which certain cultural reference points are negotiated and re-defined. Both the Hill Top visitors and members of the small discussion groups used Beatrix Potter and, by implication the literary texts, to conceptualize childhood experiences and to construct and re-inter- pret such experiences for younger generations. For Britons and North Americans in particular, Potter's books were frequently invoked to delineate impor- tant family memories and relationships. As Edith, a small group member with grown children explained: 'Beatrix Potter must have been read to me ... I then read her to my younger sisters and brother ... the books greatly appealed to me, and then I read them to my sons.' Or, as a much younger American male visitor commented: the books 'are a very important part of our children's childhood.' Beatrix Potter has now become associated sym- bolically with a variety of feelings about childhood and the nature of both child and adult experiences. As such, the writer as an individual and the stories that she created are often secondary to their symbolic importance. Numerous interviewees claimed that they could not imagine childhood without Beatrix Potter. Yet, ideas of childhood were consistently constructed as part of a shared adult heritage. Some people even admitted that the books were more important to them as adults than they were to the children they were reading to. As a male English visitor noted: it's possible that I liked the books more than my son did. You appreciate them more as an adult.' And, even adult interviewees who had never read the books were adamant that they were integral to child-life and experience. Such textual readings and appropriations are interesting because they illustrate the extent to which aspects of literary heritage have been incorporated into other facets of cultural life and communication. Few adults, for example, were willing to engage in alternative readings of Potter's texts for such readings would destroy the basis of a valued tradition. It is comfortable, for instance, to overlook the fact that in The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher the main character is almost eaten by a trout, and that the central theme in The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck is seduction and murderous intent. These stories are a connection to</page><page sequence="9">childhood, and childhood by popular definition is 'good/ Similarly, although in The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin that naughty squirrel has his tail dismembered by an owl and, in the process, narrowly escapes being skinned alive, such elements could be rationalized via a childhood affinity. As one woman put it: 'I still read [the books] because of my childhood.' Another woman took this idea further maintaining that Potter's stories were 'lovely. There's no violence in them really. Not the violence as we know today.' Not only do Potter's books seem to fulfil a deep-seated cultural need for an idealized childhood golden age, but they are also connected to notions of heritage and a rural past constantly juxtaposed against the urban present. Amongst the Hill Top interviewees, 28% cited the rural setting as that aspect of the site they found most appealing while 22% and 42% respectively mentioned links with Potter's illustrated stories and authentic atmosphere. Why, then, was the country setting deemed so important, and how were Potter's books used to mediate rural images and experiences? Such inter-connections between readers, texts and place have much to do with links between childhood and the pastoral tradition discussed above. As Williams (1973: 172) explains: 'a way of seeing has been connected with a lost phase of living, and the association of happiness with childhood has been developed into a whole convention . . . imprinted ... on a particular period of the rural past.' Both the Hill Top visitors and members of the small discus- sion groups appropriated Potter's texts in this way, using memories of the books to assign particular social and cultural values to childhood and rural life. As one man related: 'The Beatrix Potter books are some of my earliest memories. My Mother reading them gave me my first links with the English coun- tryside.' A Canadian woman was even more specific, asserting that the stories 'coloured my whole child- hood. . . . Reading those stories made [me] think of this kind of country. The countryside as it used to be and, really surprisingly, still is.' This last comment highlights how Potter's books have been transferred into contexts that transcend political geographic barriers. For many North American and Japanese visitors the English country- side was the locus for diverse images. This imagery reflected such disparate influences as family heritage, consumer advertising, and a pervasive antipathy towards modern, usually urban culture. Yet, as both the interviewees and small group participants con- sistently drew Potter's books into these larger social and cultural frameworks, textual meanings were re-defined. At an extreme, the books and the place were merged into overarching notions of 'Englishness' and English heritage. As one man proffered the following description of Hill Top: 'It's a pretty garden and peaceful setting. A typical English house of the 83 period. Sweet and nice [but] it all looks the same. Wordsworth, Stratford. It's all old England.' In other cases, though, Potter and the tourist visit were a catalyst for thoughtful reflection about valued tradi- tions vis-à-vis modernity. By comparing literary images with reality, both interviewees and small group members focused on relationships between past and present, rural and urban. In the words of a British female visitor: 'I love the history of it, the antiquity It's even better than I imagined it.' And as an American primary school teacher exclaimed: 'When I walked in the house I had chill bumps. ... We don't live like that now It's not like Texas where everyone is rushing around.' Finally, for a female Japanese visitor the Beatrix Potter experience provided a sort of spiritual catharsis: 'I feel by visiting this place as if my brain, my heart is purified. I'm away from the city.' As preserved by the National Trust, the Beatrix Potter heritage has become part of a larger tradition of country life; one which is, in large part a product of the urban imagination. Beatrix Potter inspired tourism, however, gives palpable expression to literary fancy. In the words of an English interviewee: 'it's turned fantasy into reality.' This transformation of textual meaning into 'reality' was elaborated upon by a woman from southern England: 'it's like stepping back into your childhood. You remember the books you read and then you see the things [here]. It's comforting, it's reassuring.' Since such literary meanings and associations are socially constructed, they are constantly negotiated by different people in different contexts. Thus, as I argue here, the same literary text can be read in a myriad of ways and, from an empirical stance, literary inspired tourism is but one example of how textual meanings may be appropriated, transformed and re-interpreted. Conclusions As a function of their translation into numerous languages, their commemoration via product mer- chandising and, not least, their continued promotion via global tourism, Beatrix Potter's books have been drawn into an international sphere of cultural pro- duction, consumption and commerce. By taking the example of Potter's illustrated stories, I have high- lighted relationships between literature and cultural communication and, identifying connections between texts, place and literary heritage, I have also raised questions about the role of the reader, and the meanings that readers may make with books. Allusions to Beatrix Potter have become part of popular cultural expression. A contemporary British poet, for example, writing about urban deprivation invoked Potter's imagery to describe men 'holed up in some bar among the dives of Deptford, deep in</page><page sequence="10">84 their cups, and a packet of cashew nuts, like Chippy Hackee and cute little Timmy Tiptoes hiding from their wives' (Morrison 1987). And, at the opposite end of the spectrum, best-selling romantic novelist Jilly Cooper has embellished her chronicles of the loves and lives of English country families with Beatrix Potter motifs: 'Lady Gosling, decided Cameron, looked more like a hedgehog than a goose, a Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, with small twinkling intelligent eyes (Cooper 1988: 93). These excerpts are yet another manifestation of how literature can be enmeshed with cultural appropriation, transformation and communication. With few exceptions, however, geographers have been reluctant to devote serious attention to popular fiction, children's literature included, or to scrutinize closely the social and cultural meanings and contexts associated with literary texts. In this paper, I have assessed some of these issues and, in exploring values for Beatrix Potter's work, I have situated a geographic appraisal of literature within a larger discourse about theory, culture and society. The research interface between geography and literature continues to evolve. With this evolution, however, new questions must be asked about rela- tionships between literature and culture, and how literary spaces and places may be interpreted and experienced. Methodological and analytical concerns are paramount. Thus, as work on geography and literature is drawn into the 'new' cultural geography, there is an urgent need to more fully integrate theoretical approaches with empirical practise, and to identify, from diverse perspectives, the multi- faceted producers and consumers of literary texts. From such perspectives, there is also scope to speculate about literature's importance within a larger panorama of social change. Children's literature especially can be an accurate mirror of shifting social attitudes and values. Continuing discussions about 'political correctness', for example, are reflected in the texts we give our children and 'old' texts are re-constituted for these new purposes. In this light, Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit has been seized upon as a treatise for the mother-led, single parent family. Literature, and popular fiction in particular might also be more fully integrated into recent debates about post-modernism, and the nature of post-modern societies (Harvey 1989). Although it has not been my intention here to speculate about connections between work on geography, literature and post- modern theorisation, adult interest in 'classic' children's texts reflects wider social and economic changes. Preoccupation with heritage and rural life, of which interest in Beatrix Potter's books now forms part, must be assessed within other frameworks; prin- cipally economic re-structuring and its attendant cultural and social dislocations. Finally, new questions must be asked about inter- sections between literary and visual images. In the case of Beatrix Potter's work, the textual narrative and accompanying illustrations together form a coherent whole.2 Even if unillustrated, however, most regional literature evokes visions of place and land- scape. And, as we rely increasingly upon visual imagery to interpret and make sense of our world, the visual promises to supersede the literary as a com- municative tool. If, as Jackson (1989: 2) argues, 'culture is the way the social relations of a group are structured and shaped [and] also the way those shapes are experienced, understood and interpreted,' the role of visual imagery merits greater attention. How are textual and visual images inter-related? By extension, how may readers connect the textual with the visual, reappropriating such images into other contexts? What are the implications of such re-appropriations? Gregory and Ley (1988: 115) describe 'culture's geographies [as] extraordinarily complicated.' As I argue here, these geographies are premised upon meanings, transformed into new contexts over space and time. Literature can be integral to such processes. In exploring the research interface between geog- raphy and literature, however, we cannot limit our- selves to consideration of textual narrative or conventional source material alone. 'Literary geog- raphy' must be multi-facetted, embracing diverse theoretical strands and methodological perspectives. Landscapes and places are social constructs. Thus, in developing new links between literature and geo- graphic analysis, more serious scrutiny of textual creation, interpretation and representation is essen- tial.
