<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEANEY'S BLACKBIRD Chris Agee Wide-angled in the light of time. (SAMHAIN INTERNATIONAL POETRY FESTIVAL, OCTOBER 2004) In my second collection, First Light, the title-poem is a small hommage to an old pastime of mine, beachcombing. The poem arose out of an hour-or-so's walk along a long crescent of sand in southern Rhode Island early one summer morning in 1994. By the time I had returned to my starting point at the southern end of the crescent, the poem was inwardly complete, bar the tweakings and finessings that always come with committing the imagined construction to paper. The beach itself, Crescent Beach - as it has been known for perhaps three centuries - is the western rim of a small pear-shaped island, Block Island, named after a Dutch trader, eight miles by five, lying between the better-known Martha's Vineyard and the eastern tip of Long Island. It is a place where I partly grew up in a biographical sense, but more metaphorically, also in an emotional sense, having spent a decade of summers there from childhood to young adulthood. Its once-pastoral topography of rolling meadows, stone walls, wind-licked grasses, marine scrub, dunes and beaches wide open to the Atlantic - so reminiscent of certain landscapes in the West of Ireland, I would later discover - I still have imprinted on the mind like the proverbial back-of-the-hand. If there is one place that is my emotional patria - one place, as Auden puts it in his "In Praise of Limestone," I am "constantly homesick for" - then this island microcosm is it. It is, as another poem in First Light has it, with a nod to the ineffable, "that place/ I first felt its deep offing" - this "offing" representing, I would say, the offering of life pure and simple, without metaphysical gloss, here and ahead, whatever it may bring. Those landscapes of childhood and youth somehow enter one's deepest being as one enters, through them, more fully into the adventure of life. One's first narrative is the polestar to which all later divagations must align and configure. About a third of the poems in my first collection, In the New Hampshire Woods, explore my feeling for this island landscape backdropped by a coming-of-age, including several that take their particulars from the long arc of Crescent Beach. I like the aformentioned title-poem for its simplicity and straightforwardness. Not something I always seek or, indeed, can always achieve. There is nothing in it that does not deal directly, empirically, with both the outward and inward experience of that hour of beachcombing. No detour of image, no metaphor or buried allusion, not even the final inward turn, takes us away from the actuality of the walk. This cleaving to "the bastion of 193</page><page sequence="2">IRISH PAGES sensation" is one of my poetic ideals; and whilst it certainly aligns with my temperament, especially as it was moulded by an early and deep exposure to North American wilderness, it also reflects, unquestionably, as with so many other poets, a debt to the poetry of Seamus Heaney, characterized, as it is, by an almost pretertiatural beauty of language, cleanness of line, and depth and breadth of sensibility. Nonetheless, I think most readers or listeners of this small poem of mine will have little trouble discerning an extension of meaning beyond the cleaved- to particulars of beachcombing. From the opening "one begins not knowing" to the final "looking back," "First Light" could be read as extended image for the way the psycho-dynamics of poem-making come to mix the unexpected, the rhythmic and the random in a single forward creative motion; or even as a little parable for the life journey itself, for consciousness-in-action, and the way we can never quite apprehend the past steps that have brought us to our present moment. In other words, like several others in the collection, "First Light" is also self-reflexive, about the torque of its own creation: it mirrors and transcribes, step by step, almost self-scientifically, the movements of one poet's imaginative circuitry. Part of the alchemy of the successful poem lies in this ability to create a space, an imaginative agora, so to speak, where such extensions of meaning are given leave and thus expected, and so encouraged and cultivated. Poetry, you might say, is the art of meaningful extension par excellence. Looking back at the genesis of the poem a decade ago, I am struck now by how much personal experience in and around Crescent Beach predated its sudden composition. I probably did not think of this personal background at all during the walk itself, the conscious mind plunged into a trance of composition, like that dawn's half-moon sunk into the blue of morning. Those childhood days, for instance, playing around the mussel-encrusted breakwaters, or by the high stilted seats of lifeguards. A teenaged tryst with a girlfriend, sitting awkwardly on a blanket before the sea's ravishing moonlight. My father, still hale and handsome, striding along the beach, a few weeks before I left for Ireland. A walk with my grandmother, during my first island stay in 1966, hoping with child's hope for a message-in-a-bottle - which, fairy tale- like, came my way a moment later, in the form of a bottled postcard from the US Navy, requesting a return-by-mail with geographical information on its washed-up whereabouts. No trace of any this is there in the poem, but I find myself thinking now that my long history of time on this beach would certainly have primed that hour's alertness to "what the mind will beachcomb from the radiant flux/of things in the intertidal zone". In the event, nothing much happened, apart from the marvel of being alive in the visible universe. And not so long ago, it came to me that perhaps my first real aspiration to write a poem took form on this beach, when I noticed my shadow following me along the slick gloss of the 194</page><page sequence="3">IRISH PAGES tide's aftermath. Which, come to think of it, is a sound image I ought to use some time. But I lacked even the most rudimentary poetic muscle then - and for many more years to come. That poetic musculature, it goes without saying, thrives on both technique and sensibility. Somewhere Paul Muldoon remarks that every good poem is "an adventure in language," to which might be added it must also be an adventure in experience, on some level, often of an extraordinarily subtle and inward nature, like the finest tones of a photograph. If the ability to touch posterity constitutes the natural selection of literature, then the two adventures entwined make for the survival of the fittest. The ability to excel in both adventures, folded into a voice whose suppleness approaches consciousness itself, is of course the special genius of Seamus Heaney's poem-making. Truth to tell, I number him among the very greatest in the English language, the sort of poet that comes along only few times in any one country, in any one century. There is a Shakespearean coherence and roundedness to the whole meteoric arc of his career. What might he still produce as he moves through further years that Shakespeare, gone at 52, never saw? I remember the moment when this particular subliminal penny dropped, and that atmospheric dawned; not so much as some critical parallel, but rather as the stuff of metaphor. Heaney had just faxed me a poem, in connection with some editing I was doing, and as I ripped the sheets from the machine, I found myself murmuring without pre- reflection: like getting afaxfrom Shakespeare... But to return to beachcombing, which is also an apt image for one's delight in certain poems. The puzzle of beachcombing is this: why does the eye delight in one thing, and not another? Why this pebble, this shell, this bit of seaweed, this bird, and not another? It is quite similar, indeed, with poetic composition: amongst the myriad available, why this image, and not another? Why does the mind beachcomb this force or form or pattern or creature in nature, for instance, and not another? Can we divine in such innate selectivity some correspondence between the psychic and cosmic orders (or disorders), or is that just idle anthropomorphism? (Two sea-poems in First Light explore this train of thought). Likewise with reader-response: why does one poem impact more powerfully than another of obviously equal quality? What exactly has clicked? And what does this click tell you? I will now cut to the chase. This small discursus on beachcombing and the Nobel Laureate has an upshot. For as a reader as well as a poet, I am a something of devotee to the beachcombing method. Compared to the poetic genius loci of Gortahork, my editorial comrade, Cathal O Searcaigh - who reads very deep and very wide, as is well-known among his literary peers - I read mainly deep, being hooked by a certain limited number of writers whom I then follow over time with avidity and thoroughness. For the rest, I rely on the luck of the beachcomb. A poem, an essay, a book washes up on the day's psychic strand. If it touches my beachcomber's eye, it goes straight to the 195</page><page sequence="4">IRISH PAGES psychic strong room, as one drops a beachcombed shell or pebble into one's coat pocket, for future display on the shelf of the mind. Actually, because I am such a literary magpie, especially with poetry, I find it hard to choose from among this shelf of literary valuables and to nominate, for instance, particular poems as favourites, though, of course, as with friends, I like to spend time with some more than others. Choosing between great poems is rather like choosing between beautiful faces: an invidious task, compounded by the fact that taste is a mystery. Indeed, why have the legions of bad poems become a kind of folk knowledge, but not the contrary observation, just as true? Speaking as an editor as well as a poet, I am inclined to admire any poem that is originally realized and individuated in the terms of its own imaginative ecology, however aslant to the reigning ecosystem of styles. The strong poem is always a true species, never the imitation decoy. Language used with high artistic consciousness, out of whatever current and using whatever psychic materials, is my reader's holy grail. As A.R. Ammons writes in his marvellous Garbage - a long philosophical poem set in a Florida dump: I say to my writing students - prize your flaws, defects, behold your accidents, engage your negative criticisms - these are the materials on your ongoing - from these places you imagine, find, or make the ways back to all of us, the figure, keeping the aberrant periphery worked clear so the central current may shift or slow or rouse adjusting to the necessary dynamic ... One's own practice demands, of'course, this dowser's interest in the achieved poem of others. What makes it tick? And what makes it click for you? I now want to use a recent poem by Seamus Heaney to lift the veil a little from this backstage understudy of other work, a core activity. "The Blackbird of Glanmore" was sent to me a few months ago and I keep returning to it. It possesses a subtle alchemy of effects that is one of Heaney's hallmarks. Heaney is an especially good example of the difficulty of nominating favourite poems. His work is so steady and magisterial, so without real dip in quality, that the exercise would soon become academic. There is a strong sense, too, that each poem is one uniquely fitted piece of the jigsaw from a radiantly inward geography that he appears able to mine inexhaustibly. The surpassing coherence and extent of this psychic excavation, especially as it relates to interlocking patterns of imagery and tonality across his whole oeuvre, is another of the things that sets him apart quite dramatically. 196</page><page sequence="5">IRISH PAGES On a first reading of "The Blackbird of Glanmore", I was immediately struck by its conjoining of two things: a restrained, quotidian, quiet mood, and its undertows of extraordinary power. At the same time, I remarked to myself how easy it would be to glide through this poem, admiring yet another sterling emanation from the Heaney mint, but failing to twig on to the muted genius of his interlacing of experience and language. Deep and real feeling as here is never grand guignol, it has often this quotidian, matter-of-fact setting. So in his short line here there is a deliberate flattening of poetic effect away from the lushness and exuberance of language on display, say, in his major sets of sonnets or sequences of untitled poems. Helen Vender has remarked on Heaney's unrivalled ability to create continuously varied linguistic structures fitted to the finest graduations of consciousness, and the power of this poem's psychic snapshot lies in its fidelity to the exactitude of a rare mood. With further readings, I began to marvel at the compendium of discrete verbal beauties that could culminate in such poetic power nonetheless heightened through its deliberate curbing. This is poetry as wisdom. How does he work the alchemy? Let us take a closer look. I will say a something about the poem in general, followed by a few words about each stanza. THE BLACKBIRD OF GLANMORE On the grass when I arrive, Filling the stillness with life, But ready to scare off At the very first wrong move. In the ivy when I leave. It's you, blackbird, I love. I park, pause, take heed. Breathe. Just breathe and sit, And lines I once translated Come back: "I want away To the house of death, to my father, Under the low clay roof." And I think of one gone to him, A little stillness dancer - Haunter-son, lost brother - Cavorting through the yard, So glad to see me home, 197</page><page sequence="6">IRISH PAGES My homesick first term over. And think of a neighbour's words Long after the accident: "Yon bird on the shed roof, Up on the ridge for weeks - I said nothing at the time But I never liked yon bird." The automatic lock Clunks shut, the blackbird's panic Is shortlived, for a second I've a bird's eye view of myself, A shadow on raked gravel In front of my house of life. Hedge-hop, I am absolute For you, your ready talkback, Your each stand-offish comeback, Your picky, nervy goldbeak - On the grass when I arrive, In the ivy when I leave. (first published by The King's Library Press as a limited edition keepsake for the Yeats Summer School, August 2004) Overview This is a Wicklow poem. Some of Heaney's most celebrated work, like "Exposure" at the end of North and "Glanmore Sonnets" in Fieldwork, has had as its locale his cottage in Glanmore, in the Wicklow Hills. It was here he first moved with his family after Loyalist threats contributed to his decision to depart the North. So Glanmore is not only a place where important work has been done and continues to be done, a second home and working retreat, but also a locus classicus in his poetry for meditations on the poetic art and his own grapplings with his public role as a poet. Wicklow has served him as the physical landscape par excellence for the conjoining of the lyrical and the ethical in the practice of his art. "The Blackbird of Glanmore" is also one a series of car poems scattered 198</page><page sequence="7">IRISH PAGES across his oeuvre, where driving, or roadside halts, become the occasion for a meditative taking-stock in the midst of the life journey. Recent poems of this mould are "Postscript" at the end of The Spirit Level, "Ballynahinch Lake" in Electric Light, and "Nonce Words" published in the second issue of Irish Pages. In the first of these, the car is not stopped, since in light of the surrounding beauties that are blowing through him, it is "useless to think you'll park and capture it/More thoroughly." But in each of the others there is a roadside halt where an extraordinarily subtle, yet universally recognizable, mood and apperception are netted, recorded, and so made transparent from out of the more opaquely lived quotidian. Stanza One One notices at once all the little taut interlacings: the riffs of assonance (arrive, life, ivy; ready, very, ivy); the internal rhymes (filling, stillness); the half- or slant rhymes at the end position (arrive, move, leave), the colloquial rightness of scare off; the plain and mainly Anglo-Saxon vocabulary; the simplicity of the set-off line and its song-like self-identification. Not one of these effects is beyond any competent poet, but the totality of interplay is pure Heaney. And although the poem as a whole has no set rhyme-scheme, each of the other stanzas-plus- outrider possesses the same interlacing interplay of image and ear, making the feat, in the very absence of said fixed scheme, still more impressive. Stanza Two More simplicity in the very casualness, the precise usualness, of the monosyllabic verbs (park, pause, take heed, breathe, sit). The beautifully demotic take heed is very characteristic. Then from verbs to the nominative double-take of lines, and an acceleration into intertextuality with both another poet and himself. Literature itself, of course, is a profound and pervasive presence in his work. Not for Heaney the strange populist idea one gleans off some critics and poets that allusions to literature should be kept out of literature. The quote itself, with that touch of Ulster in away and echo of Gaelic in clay (from crd), is quite surprising, really quite striking, when one keeps in mind the autobiographical context. Who would have thought Heaney could share the fleeting desire to give it all up? His life and career appear to be so charmed, as he himself admits in one poem: "lucky lucky lucky," he says of himself . But there it is, a feeling for grief's black road, one of history's secret forces. Stanza Three And then the plunge, the still-deeper swerve, into the naturalness of the memory of the death of his four-year old brother, commemorated in an early 199</page><page sequence="8">IRISH PAGES poem in his first collection, "Mid-term Break," written forty years before, and ending: "A four foot box, a foot for every year." Minded that the twin of grief is silence, the curt economy of feeling here, brightened nonetheless by the memory stirring in the mind, cannot but deeply impress, all of it lashed together with more superb touches: the odd but perfect "little stillness dancer" echoing the description of the blackbird in the second line; the trinity of er words (dancer, haunter, brother) not only creating a compound image of Christopher's life and afterlife-in-memory, but echoing father above; the diminuendo assonance of o through home, homesick and over, suggesting, ever so slightly, the desolation of the loss itself; and haunter-son suggesting how the little boy must have ghosted his namesake, Heaney's own son, the nephew he would never see. Stanza Four That think shorn of its personal pronoun, like the verbs in the second stanza, partakes of the telegraphese of actual thought and so keeps us close to the poet's stilled moment of memory and breath-awareness seated before the steering wheel. Likewise, the baleful words of the Ulster neighbour swim into his stream of consciousness, as such a distinct recollection would. What does the Ulsterman's blackbird suggest, in contradistinction to the one on the grass at Glanmore? I would say the dreadful existential fear of the world and its works that the aftermath of great traumas can induce. So Heaney sees this thing, too. This breadth of insight, beyond the deep reserves of emotion asparkle with technique and intellect, strikes me again as Shakespearean. The shed's blackbird seems a tonal entrance, as well, into the older Ireland into which Heaney the countryman was born, though only in its purely negative aspect; a blacker and bleaker Ireland of charms and omens and cures, crabbedly poetic (for the image is extremely powerful), more fear-blighted and death- haunted, more ancestrally marked by traumas, naturally and anciently alive to the malignancy and suffering of existence. Stanza Five But this is not Heaney's Ireland, or Heaney's blackbird, or at least no longer so. Heaney is a Modern who has left the Agraria of Bellaghy, the up-to-date car lock clunks shut, and the memory of the neighbour's fear-struck blackbird dissipates in tandem with the panic of the living blackbird on the grass before him. So this is also one of the many poems in his oeuvre, beginning with the first in his first collection, "Digging," that marks his psychic and professional progress from the pre-modern "den-life" of the Co Derry smallholding he describes in his Nobel Speech. That we are meant to identify the bird with the poet's sensibility, even his credo for living, clear enough from the alchemy performed by these lines, is 200</page><page sequence="9">IRISH PAGES nonetheless underscored by the imaginative levitation in the phrase "a bird's eye view of myself". The identification of the bird with the poet, the feather with the pen, is of course a classical-beginning trope, and one Heaney has often used. There is thus the suggestion in the succeeding image, the strange and beautiful wide-angle of his smallness in the light of time, of the shadowy and transient life that leaves behind its poems. An image not so different, really, from that shadow of self on Crescent Beach thirty-something years ago. But if his own life is suggested by its shadow, why, then, is he only in front of the "house of life"? The phrase harkens back, to my mind unmistakably, in a further instance of the self-intertextuality already seen in the second stanza, towards another Wicklow poem, one to which I have returned many times, and which I would venture to call one of my Heaney favourites, a first-among- equals. Notice how much work is done by the title and the dedication, giving an off-stage temporal and geographic setting for this traditional African tale, grounding, in other words, the mythological in the personal, or vice versa: A DOG WAS CRYING TONIGHT IN WICKLOW ALSO in memory of Donatus Nwoga When human beings found out about death They sent the dog to Chukwu with a message: They wanted to be let back to the house of life. They didn't want to end up lost forever Like burnt wood disappearing into smoke Or ashes that get blown away to nothing. Instead, they saw their souls in a flock at twilight Cawing and headed back for the same old roosts And the same bright airs and wing-stretchings each morning. Death would be like a night spent in the wood: At first light they'd be back in the house of life. (The dog was meant to tell all this to Chukwu). But death and human beings took second place When he trotted off the path and started barking At another dog in broad daylight just barking Back at him from the far bank of a river. And that is how the toad reached Chukwu first, The toad who'd overheard in the beginning What the dog was meant to tell. "Human beings," he said (And here the toad was trusted absolutely), "Human beings want death to last forever." 201</page><page sequence="10">IRISH PAGES Then Chukwu saw the people's souls in birds Coming towards him like black spots off the sunset To a place where there would be neither roosts nor trees Nor any way back to the house of life. And his mind reddened and darkened all at once And nothing that the dog would tell him later Could change that vision. Great chiefs and great loves In obliterated light, the toad in mud, The dog crying out all night behind the corpse house. (from The Spirit Level, 1996) With "The Blackbird of Glanmore", one could feel, of course, that "my house of life" carries the same literal denotation as the similar phrase in the African tale, extending the shadow-image into its generalized gloss. But Heaney never uses any resource of language without discernible intent (another of his greatnesses) and I think there is a migration of meaning introduced here, through the spatial "in front of," that is carried through and amplified in the concluding stanza. Stanza Six Notice again the beautiful economy and mimicry of all the effects in this small space: the perfect visual and aural fit of hedge-hop; the unusual, colloquial yet somehow classical Heaney absolutefor you, with its sly assonance; the repetition and chimes of consonance in talkback, comeback, goldbeak; the further adjectival assonance (ready, picky, nervy, ivy) as in the first stanza; the repetition, with a new investiture of meaning, of two lines from the opening stanza. With true poetic alchemy, the stanza manages to mimic the actual physical jerkiness and nerviness of the blackbird in a way that, nonetheless, becomes metaphorical for something that Heaney admires, in contradistinction to the Ulsterman's blackbird of fixity and death. Heaney's blackbird is full of adjectival readiness, talkback, distance, comeback, acquisitiveness, and beauty. So what is he pointing at by meaningful extension? With this Glanmore blackbird he has seen and loved so often, in this place where so much work has been done, a cottage of art and not of farming, one is put in mind not only of certain qualities of his own work, but of the very recorded origin of poetry in Irish and in Ireland, the small poem commonly entitled "The Lagan Blackbird," with its goldbeak and chirrup, an anonymous monkish gloss from the ninth century, written not far from his home ground. 202</page><page sequence="11">IRISH PAGES Coda "My house of life," I think, is the house of poetry. This is the route to which he has dedicated his life, the route that took him away from his people, his home place, his dead. In this poem Heaney the man, ready for the work, stands before this more enduring house of poetry; the shadow of the life which produces the work will dissolve, like his lost brother's, "like burnt wood disappearing into smoke". By pausing, in the course of the life journey, by taking heed and breathing deeply, he enters this house from time to time, but only under imaginative conditions, or geasa, concerning his own essential attitude to life. What the blackbird of Glanmore represents seems, above all, what he has left to the blackbird on the shed. The key phrase in this poem, I feel, must be scare off. Look at those opening four lines: surely, also, a description of the making of a poem. Poetry is the sense of talkback, comeback, fight-back against a dog barking in Wicklow. In this sense, and perhaps this sense alone, poetry is fully congruent with life itself. The Blackbird of Glanmore is a talisman for entrance from the quotidian into the house of poetry. Thus it is that the bird, unscared- off for the duration of the imaginative visit, is "on the grass when I arrive, / In the ivy when I leave."
