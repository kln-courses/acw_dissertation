General Motor Research Labs Lawrence M. Patrick Libbey Owens Ford Co. A RESEARCH PROGRAM was initiated in coopera- tion with Wayne State University to determine the response of the human knee during impact with a deformable material in order to provide biome- chanical guidelines for evaluating the acceptability of anthropomorphic dummy knees. The need for such guidelines was demonstrated by performance comparisons between the Part 572 and the HSRI dummies during air cushion restraint barrier tests reported by Neathery, et al [1]* in which peak femur loads were considerably different. *Numbers in brackets designate References at the end of the paper. Allowable femur tolerance as measured with the Part 572 dummy is based on human cadaver fracture data by Patrick, et al.[2] obtained by im- pacting the knees against lightly padded rigid sur- faces. Several investigators [3, 4, 5] have reported higher force levels for dummy subjects than for cadaver subjects when struck on the knee with un- padded or lightly padded impactors. Horsch [5] and Kroell [6] reported that the external dynamic force applied to the dummy knee is greater than that measured by the femur transducer due to the struc- tural mass distal to the femur load cell. The current dummy knee response- qualification test [7] specifies a rigid unpadded pendulum impact. ABSTRACT Knees of 13 unembalmed human cadavers and a Part 572 dummy were impacted with a pendulum having either 203 mm square aluminum honeycomb or Styrofoam DB striking surface. Impacts were made along the femoral axis of rigidly mounted legs with a 52. 3 kg pendulum at velocities of 1. 8 and 3. 6 m/s. Forces transmitted through the femur and tibia (at the ankle) were measured to determine the force response distribution. Pendulum acceleration parallel to the femoral axis was measured for all tests. Knee penetrations into the striking surface material were obtained by double integration of the pendulum acceleration-time traces, were verified by analysis of high speed movies, and were com- pared with the projected contact areas as penetra- tion increased. Impact responses are presented as crossplots of force versus depth of knee penetration into the interface material. For aluminum honeycomb impacts at 3. 6 m/s, the mean peak force resulting from cadaver impacts is lower than the mean peak force resulting from dummy knee impacts. However, for Styrofoam DB impacts at 3.6 m/s, the mean force-penetration response of the cadaver knees is similar to the re- sponse of the Part 572 dummy knee. Significant differences in peak force levels for the cadaver and dummy were not observed with either aluminum honeycomb or with Styrofoam DB at 1.8 m/s impact velocities. 3284 0096-736X/78/8604-3284$02.50 Copyright © 1978 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">Even if a dummy knee-femur system were developed to simulate the human response to hard surface im- pacts, there is no assurance that the design would perform properly when impacted by deformable surface such as found in an automobile interior. Nyquist [8] reported static force -penetration knee response of human volunteers during loading by Styrofoam. He presented a percentile scaling of the static force-penetration response data which can be applied to different dummy sizes. While static tests identify differences in size and shape of knees of various dummies, dynamic tests are required to evaluate the impact responses. Since lower instru- ment panel knee restraints are deformable, low- ďush strength materials were selected as the im- pacting interface for the study presented in this paper. METHODOLOGY TEST DESCRIPTION - Fig. 1 shows a typical test setup with the Part 572 dummy leg in the test po- sition. The leg is supported at the femur and ankle with biaxial load cells used to measure both horizontal and vertical forces. The femur biaxial load cell is pin-jointed to a large rigid mass to prevent subjecting the load cell to bending moments in the plane of loading. The setup was designed to incorporate the standard dummy femur load cell as well. Human cadaver legs were amputated and supported at the location comparable to the distal end of the dummy femur load cell. The knees were impacted with a 52. 3 kg (115 lb) pendulum supported by a four wire system. Nominal impact velocities of 1.8 and 3.6 m/s were used. The 3.6 m/s velocity was chosen because it is a reasonable knee-instrument panel impact velocity based on observation of movies taken at the GM Proving Ground during 30 mph barrier crashes using a 50 percentile dummy. The 1.8 m/s velocity was chosen to investigate possible rate dependent effects. Impact acceleration of the pendulum was mea- sured by an accelerometer located inside the rear face and oriented with its sensitive axis colinear with the cen ter line of the pendulum. Impact force was calculated by multiplying the impactor mass by the measured acceleration. Displacement of the pendulum relative to the knee was determined by high speed movie analysis and also by double in- tegration of the pendulum acceleration-time trace. Crushable interface materials of nominally 152 mm (6 in) thickness were used on the front of the pendulum. Aluminum honeycomb and Styrofoam DB (decorative billet) were used as interfacing ma- terials in this program. The cadaver knees (all except the first knee, cadaver 2862) were impacted an average of two times with each material at 3. 6 m/s. INTERFACE MATERIAL SELECTION - Quasi-static crush tests were performed on several types of foam materials and two types of aluminum honeycomb prior to selection of material for the crushable in- terface. Material selections were based on the fol- lowing qualifications : 1. The interface material was to be commer- cially produced and available to any test agency at some future time. 2.

(within practical limits) with respect to crush characteristics. 3. Crush strength had to be in the range of 207 - 345 kPa (30 - 50 psi). This was a calculated crush strength range which would allow nominally 76 mm (3 in) of knee penetration and limit the maxi- mum force to less than the 7562 N tolerance level for the 3. 6 m/s impact speed with a 52. 3 kg pendu- lum mass. Aluminum honeycomb had been used with favor- able results by various investigators in some pre- liminary dummy knee impact tests. Quasi-static crush (loading rate of 13 mm/ min) of the material between two flat plates demonstrated the material to crush at a nearly constant force level for at least 80% of the available crush depth as shown in Fig. 2. Since size and shape of the knee were considered important parameters in this study, this crush char- acteristic was considered favorable. In addition, Hexcel Corporation indicated that a +5% crush strength tolerance could be met and that the ma- terial would be available at future dates. Conse- quently, Hexcel honeycomb was selected as the primary interface material for this project. Speci- fications for the honeycomb are listed in Table 1. The honeycomb was precrushed 6.35 mm (0. 25 in) to eliminate the high load required to initiate crush of this material. Styrofoam DB (decorative billet) was selected to supplement the aluminum honeycomb data for determining impact response characteristics of cadaver knees. Styrofoam DB had been used for static knee tests [8] and exhibited the desired qualifications with one exception; Dow Chemical Company could not guarantee crush strength or density from one production lot to another. Our test experience indicated that the material proper- ties are similar within a single production lot. It seemed likely that a second production lot with similar properties may be somewhat difficult to purchase at a later date. Material specifications for Styrofoam DB are listed in Table 1. Quasi-static crush properties for the Styrofoam DB were determined by pressing a 102 mm (4 in) diameter flat disc into the foam at a loading rate of 12. 7 mm/min.

It is obvious from this illustration that the crush resistance is depen- dent upon depth of crush of the loading device. Both materials required special consideration for dynamic loading. The honeycomb material re- quired a special backing plate with vent holes to relieve pressure buildup within the individual cells. Hole spacings were such that there was a 1. 59 mm diameter hole for almost every cell in the area of knee impact. The Styrofoam DB was contained in a four sided box. In preliminary tests with this material, the material sometimes split into two pieces at the area of impact. The box supporting the top, back and two sides of the material prevented splitting. TEST PREPARATION - An important consideration of the knee impact program was to determine how much of the leg should be loaded by the interface material. The knee was arbitrarily defined to ex- tend distally to the anterior protuberance near the proximal end of the tibia. For consistency among legs of different sizes, this distance was defined as 20% of the distance between an estimated pseudo- center of knee rotation to the lowest point of the medial malleolus as illustrated in Fig. 4. This 20% value was obtained by analysis of a radiogram of the leg of a human cadaver of approximately 50th per- centile in height and weight (1676 mm, 73. 6 kg). The pseudo-center of knee rotation was deter- mined by clamping the femur to a rigid surface and rotating the lower leg. Pencils attached to the tibia (one on each side of the knee) scribed arcs on paper as shown in Fig. 5. The arc center was estimated and then transferred to the leg. This point repre- sented the pseudo-center of knee rotation and was - ^ 100% - - 43% - - ». /-Pseudo-center of knee rotation / ' - r' Femur ' T ' ^ 90°^= 20% Cut off for rigid y^" I . mounting 1 ' 1 I / -Lower edge of ' crushable material 100% I « Xi H L Axle location for-^T - J 8% ankle support j Fig. 4 - Dimensions used for the preparation and testing of human knees used as a reference point in defining leg dimensions. To attach a cadaver T s leg to the biaxial load cell, the femur was cut off at 43% of its length as shown in Fig. 4. This distance for a 50th percen- tile male corresponds to the distal end of the femur force transducer in the dummy. The cut end was cast in a metal cup with polyester resin. The cup was then attached to the load cell. The lower leg was held by an axle installed through the tibia just</page><page sequence="5">3288 W. E. HERING AND L. M. PATRICK Fig. 5 - Fixture for determining pseudo-center of knee rotation above the medial malleolus. The tibia attachment location was referenced to the pseudo-center of knee rotation. The Part 572 dummy leg (including the femur load cell) was held in the test fixture at comparable attachment locations. TEST SUBJECT SELECTION - The test subjects from which the legs were obtained consisted of 13 adult male cadavers. Legs were selected from subjects near the 50th percentile in height and weight. Cadaver data are listed in Table 2. The sample had a mean height of 1. 77 m with a standard deviation of 0. 05 m. The sample mean weight was 78. 0 kg with a standard deviation of 12. 0 kg. These values are both large as compared to the 50th per- centile male dummy specifications of 1. 73 m in height and 74. 5 kg in weight. Test subjects used in this program were used in other WSU projects. Consequently, it was necessary to freeze the legs for storage purposes prior to preparation for this test program. All but two legs were stored in this way while awaiting preparation. KNEE ANTHROPOMETRY - Knee breadth measure- ments were made for all the knees tested and are tabulated in Table 2. These values represent the condylar widths including flesh thickness. The mean of the sample is 103 mm with a standard de- viation of 5. 3 mm. The Part 572 knee breadth is 114 mm. Transverse profiles of the knees were obtained for nine of the thirteen subjects. Measurements were taken at midpatella height to enable a com- parison with available percentile distribution data [8]. Such a comparison is shown in Fig. 6. The mean profile of the nine subjects is between the 50th and 75th percentile. Although this data sample does not include all knees tested, it is not likely that the profile data from the other four subjects would change the mean significantly. The profile data are tabulated in Table 3 with the respective cadaver subjects measured for this sample. Flesh thickness was measured at various knee locations by penetration of a needle into the flesh of ten different cadaver knees. Typical flesh thick- ness over the patella and anterior tibia surface is given in Table 4. Thickness measurements over the patella ranged from 1. 52 - 9. 14 mm. Thick- ness measurements on the tibia ranged from 1. 52 - 8.64 mm. The nominal flesh thickness of the Part 572 dummy knee comparable to the patellar region is 6. 35 mm. RESULTS To illustrate typical force levels, the peak forces resulting from 3.6 m/s impacts by aluminum honeycomb to four different cadaver knees and the Part 572 dummy knee are summarized in Table 5. The mean peak pendulum force to the cadaver knees was 23% (1377 N) less than the mean peak pendulum force to the Part 572 dummy knee. Because of the small sample sizes, the Studenťs t-test was used to compare the means of these two samples. There is at least an 1100 N difference between the means of the two samples at the 90% confidence level.

There is no significant difference in the peak force values produced by impacting these particular dummy and human cadaver knees at 3.6 m/s with Styrofoam DB interface. The peak force values resulting from 1.8 m/s impacts are summarized in Table 6. Statistically, small differences between the means of peak pen- dulum forces indicate that with either interface ma- terial, the peak forces resulting from 1.8 m/s im- pacts are nominally the same for both of these par- ticular samples of human cadaver and the Part 572 dummy knees. The peak ankle forces, measured parallel to the femur longitudinal axis are nominally the same for both dummy and cadaver legs for comparable impacts. The peak ankle forces are, for the most part, less than 5% of their respective peak pendu- lum forces and occur at the same time. Summation of the horizontal components of peak ankle and femur forces are in good agreement with the respective peak pendulum force. The dummy femur load cell forces listed in Tables 5 and 6 are in good agreement with the forces measured by the biaxial load cell. It was expected that there would be excellent correlation between these measurements because they were mounted in series and attached to a large immovable mass. Peak vertical forces measured at the femur and ankle attachments are also listed in Tables 5 and 6. Forces were higher at both locations with cadaver legs than with the Part 572 dummy leg. The reason for these differences is not known. While peak force values indicate that a differenc does exist in cadaver and dummy knee responses foi the 3.6 m/s impacts with aluminum honeycomb, the; do not give a description of the entire impact event.

Cross plotting with the horizontal component of knee force gives the fore e -penetration characteristic for a given knee and impact condition. Typical force -penetration responses for 1. 8 and 3. 6 m/s impacts by aluminum honeycomb and Styrofoam DB are illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, re- spectively. The loading portion of the 1.8 m/s response is similar to that of the 3. 6 m/s response for their respective interface materials. Since these are typical responses and there is no indica- tion of a loading rate effect, the 1.8 m/s impact data will not be discussed further. Also included in Fig. 7 is a comparison of 3. 5 and 3. 6 m/s impact responses of cadavers 2823 and 3373. The velocity difference primarily resulted in additional knee penetration for the higher speed im- pact. Since the loading portion of the response does not appear to be affected, and the velocity change represents only a 5% difference in energy, all the response data from the 3. 5 and 3. 6 m/s impacts will be combined for determining mean responses. The responses shown in Figs, 7 and 8 were traced directly from the computer crossplots obtained by double integration of the pendulum acceleration- time trace. The mean response curve for each interface material was obtained by scaling force values of individual response curves at equal increments 5.08 mm (0. 2 in) of penetration. Eyeball averaging of high frequency response* (see Fig. 7) was some- times necessary. For the unloading portion of the response, the mean and standard deviation of knee penetration was determined for specific force levels. The mean force-penetration response of 12 cadaver knees (cadaver 2862 was not struck with Styrofoam) for impacts by Styrofoam DB at 3. 6 m/s is shown in Fig. 9 along with + one standard devia- tion band. The mean and standard deviation values are included in Table 7.

Considering the impact to the dummy knee was slightly low in velocity (3.5 m/s), there appears to be good agreement in responses for impacts by Styrofoam DB. The mean response curve for the impacts by aluminum honeycomb is compared toa + one stan- dard deviation band based on the cadaver response data in Fig. 12 0 The dummy response does not agree with cadaver response in this comparison. DISCUSSION A comparison of Figs. 7 and 8 illustrates typical knee response differences for the two inter- face materials, particularly at knee penetrations beyond 30 mm. This penetration level represents approximately 75% of the projected knee area as shown in Fig. 13. The small increase in project- ed area along with the rapid change in knee shape beyond 30 mm of penetration suggests that the re-</page><page sequence="9">3292 W. E. HERING AND L. M.

The Styrofoam DB offers a crush resistance in all directions whereas the aluminum honeycomb offers little crush resistance in the lateral direction. 2. The Styrofoam DB offers increasing crush resistance with increasing depth of penetration (density increases) whereas the crush resistance of aluminum honeycomb is not sensitive to depth of penetration. A simulated knee form (50.8 mm radius cylinder with a 50.8 mm radius on the end to simulate the knee shape) was loaded quasi- statically (13 mm/min) into both materials. The force versus depth of pene- tration relationships are illustrated in Fig. 14. The force clearly increases with penetrations beyond the maximum projected area of the knee form for Styrofoam DB. It is postulated that significant response differences between cadaver and dummy knees are not seen with Styrofoam DB impacts be- cause of the sensitivity to depth of penetration which is similar for both types of knees. Plaster castings were made of some of the in- dentations into the aluminum honeycomb resulting from 3.6 m/s impacts; thus the shapes of the knees during loading were obtained.

The irregular shape of the dummy knee clearly illustrates a difference in loaded shape due to the large flaps of movable vinyl on each side of the knee. Also noticable is the wider tibia on the dummy knee. The contour lines on the castings represent the projected area for various depths of penetration in 6.35 mm (0.25 in) increments. A Part 572 dummy/cadaver comparison of depth of knee penetration into aluminum honeycomb versus the projected area of the knee is illustrated in Fig. 16. This indicates the Part 572 knee to be small in size for penetrations less than 50 mm and large in size for penetrations greater than 50 mm. SUMMARY A dummy/ cadaver knee dynamic penetration response comparison was performed in which rigidly mounted legs were struck on the knee with low-crush strength materials at 1.8 and 3.6 m/s. Force -penetration response of a Part 572 dummy knee indicates similarity with the cadaver mean response for Styrofoam DB impacts; a comparison with the cadaver mean response for aluminum honeycomb indicates a difference. The cadaver mean force -penetration response for 3.6 m/s im- pacts with the aluminum honeycomb interface is different than the mean response for comparable impacts using Styrofoam DB. The summation of ankle and femur forces are in good agreement with the applied pendulum force calculated by multiplying the mass of the pendulum 6000 - Loading rate of 13 mm/min 4000 - ✓ Styrofoam DB z o / ^ ' ' Aluminum Honeycomb / 2000 - / ļ y' x-Penetration for maximum projected area 0 L 1 1 1 I I 0 20 40 60 80 100 Penetration (mm) Fig. 14 - Comparison of simulated knee responses to quasi-static loading of aluminum honeycomb and Styrofoam</page><page sequence="15">3298 W.

The peak horizontal com- ponent of forces measured at the ankle are nomi- nally 5% of the peak pendulum forces for both ca- daver and dummy knees. Consequently, the ma- jority of the load is transmitted by the femur in this test configuration. Plaster castings of the indentations into the aluminum honeycomb show a difference between the Part 572 dummy and cadaver knees in both size and shape during penetration.
