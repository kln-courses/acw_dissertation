<plain_text><page sequence="1">PINNA INDORF INTERPRETING THE HINDU TEMPLE FORM: A MODEL BASED ON ITS CONCEPTUALIZATION AS A FORMAL EXPRESSION OF MEASURED MOVEMENT INTRODUCTION critical analysis of any sculptural form must consider its embodiment of movement. In the sculpt- ing of figures, bodily movement is handled not only directly as a depiction of posture or bodily gesture but also through more subtle aesthetic means (fig. I). These include the treatment of surfaces and the composition of line and form to enhance the impression of movement. Rudolf Arnheim has addressed this aspect of form in both art and architecture, primarily western architecture. Stella Kram- risch has addressed the dynamics of Indian sculpture and to some extent of the Hindu temple as well., From her work alone it is clear that the notion of dynamic form is critical to the Hindu temple and should be considered very carefully. Although most of her discussion of dynamics focuses on the visual impact of the play of exterior surface, line, and sculptural form, she points toward another aspect of composition when she discusses the disposition of images at different distances from the center of the temple which "appear to project from the center through the thickness of the wall or they are embed- ded in it as it steps forward. "2 Kramrisch's analysis treats the temple as an aesthetic object responding to Hindu religious tradi- tions and as a setting for the dynamics of ritual. Her discussion primarily takes the point of view of the devotee or the ritual specialist using the finished building and to some extent the point of view of the builder trying to construct it, or rather the architect (sthapati or silpin)3 trying to get the temple built. It is primarily this latter viewpoint which informs this study. The need for such a study evolved during ongoing research into early Southeast Asian architecture. It is imperative to the reading and interpretation of the forms in early-Hindu and Buddhist architecture of Southeast Asia to understand the formal composition of early Indian temples. The degree to which they follow or deviate from the canons of the Indian traditions is not fully established, but early stylistic and inscriptional evidence has made clear a relationship between the Southeast Asian and Indian material culture that cannot be ignored. It would be too vast an undertaking to try to address all aspects and issues of that relation- ship fully in one work. This study focuses on a few aspects that are critical to a better understanding of early Hindu (and Buddhist) architectural form in terms relevant to architecture as a discipline and relevant to the traditional arts with their roots in India. I Kramrisch I986. 2 Ibid., 301. 3 The sthapati takes instructions from the sthdpataka (priest architect), who may be the sacrificer (yajamana) as well, according to Shukla I993, 456 (citing Apastamba Srauta Sutra 22:7.6). The sthapati would have to interpret those instructions and develop them appropriately for application as architectural form. 177</page><page sequence="2">The process of getting a temple built involves many sub-processes, from the initial felt need for a new temple to the formulation of its parts hat most critical to the under- standing of the architectural form composition is the formulation of its parts. Within the Hindu tra- dition, this process was was guided and regulated by the t of which theast, of which there are many, as well as many variations by region and period. But in each process, the architect had to select an appropriate temple type as sanctioned by texts and local customs, guided by ritual needs. The great variety of forms seen in extant temple remains, as well as the listing of permissible variations and details left to the architect in texts such as the Visnudharmottara,4 clearly show that design choices could be made. The process of making these choices must, by its nature, incorporate a conceptualization of the form. This study attempts to understand the broad principles and strategies employed in the making of architectural form by examining a broad range of forms in Southeast Asia and India for possible evi- dence of the application of such, and it has developed along with and has been informed by a study of formal models related to Southeast Asian Buddhist and Hindu architecture. Localized application of particular interpretations of general principles over a period of time in particular places has led to the emergence of various local or regional traditions in India and Southeast Asia. Looking closely at archi- tectural composition is a supplementary or perhaps alternative approach to the tracing of direct prece- dence in the development of historic traditions or aesthetic schools based on stylistic analysis. In South- east Asia there are cases which seem to indicate a synthesis of, for example, one formal model seem- ingly from one precedent with a different stylistic rendering. A multifaceted approach is thus needed. A clearer understanding of the conceptualization of architectural forms within the Hindu tradition will facilitate the study of historical forms of early Southeast Asia as an adaptation, a variation, or the emergence of an architectural language. A MODEL BASED ON MOVEMENT AND MEASURE Two aspects stand out as key to understanding the conceptualization of architectural form as applied to the building of a new Hindu temple. These are I) the notion of the temple as a form expanding out- ward and upward from its center (the sanctum), and 2) the importance of proportionate measurement. It is the purpose here to re-evaluate the issues of movement and measurement and propose a model for the analysis of temple buildings which views form as an aggregate of moving components. The concept of a dynamic form as discussed by Rudolf Arnheim in his work on visual dynamics, is perceived movement as a result of the play of the eye over the form.6 This could be taken as just an intellectual game, a mental projection of the potential for bodily movement onto the static forms of architecture. Yet Arnheim emphasizes that the movement of the eye is actually experienced. Propor- tion is thus experienced or felt as a rhythmic movement. Compositional techniques can be employed to enhance this feeling of movement, one of which is the use of a system of proportion. Proportion can of course also be appreciated intellectually both in a process of "engagement" as defined by William 4 Translated by Shah, n.d.

Not only does it employ proportion systematically,9 but the funda- mental conception of the form, as shown in its architectural detail, is that of a dynamic moving body. One could also say it is an aggregation of moving bodies (figs. 2a, 2b, zc). Thus, in order to under- stand the dynamics of the Hindu temple, it is not enough to simply use theoretical approaches such as Arnheim's to the experience of the form, although they may be relevant to the visual reading of the form, as perhaps are aspects of Hubbard's "engagement. " It is necessary to reconsider the form as a liv- ing, dynamic body, the parts of which grow extensions and move; only from that viewpoint do the details of formal articulation make sense architecturally. The anthropomorphic terminology applied to the temple fabric has long been noted, and that the temple is viewed as a living body is well established. While Kramrisch, like Arnheim, focused on a visual reading of the forms, she also expounded the philosophical, doctrinal basis for aspects of her visual interpretation and for the conceptualization of the temple as an expanding form, with its expan- sion seen as gnomonic growth.10 She explained its doctrinal roots in the sgtras and its rules in the s'astras and drew attention to its impact on the relationship of sculptural ornament to the architecture. George Michell and Adam Hardy, among others, have followed through with this conceptualization of form." Michell provided simple but lucid descriptions and explanations from an architectural point of view. He illustrated the dynamics wth a diagram showing the expansion from the center outward to the cardinal directions and discussed return to the apex over the exterior of the temple form.12 Hardy demonstrated the general concept through development of a specific model for the Karnataka temple forms. In so doing, he also provided a diagram of the dynamics of the temple form in which the move- ment is depicted in relation to a pyramidal form with internal levels, and is defined as directed down along the exterior of the form, following the centerline and corners, as well as through the central (internal) vertical axis.13 From the central vertical axis, movement is depicted as outward along cardi- nal (and sub-cardinal) cross-axes, i.e. "to the four directions," at each level. Nothing in the vastu- sastras relating to proportion and rhythmic order seems to specify a downward movement in the archi- 7 Hubbard (1981) defines "engagement" as a spontaneous process of visual and intellectual investigation of the envi- ronment which is the basis of an understanding, appreciation, and identity with the built environment. If considered in relation to the multiple intelligences theory (cf. Gardner 1993), this engagement could be through spatial under- standing, kinesthetic understanding, logical-mathematical understanding (the type of intelligence normally associ- ated with intellectual activity), and appreciation of pictorial or aesthetic qualities. 8 In the academic community, this is still dominantly a logical-mathematical endeavor, but it must draw on spatial and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. 9 Although texts may seem to prescribe only a few measurements rather arbitrarily, the mandala seems to embody not only basic measurement data, but a proportional and rhythmic system that enables extension of the system to all parts (Kramrisch I986; Nanda 200oo; Indorf, Nanda, and Wong 2002; Indorf2002b). IO Kramrisch I986. ii Michell I977. Hardy I995; 2002. 12 Michell I977, 67. I3 Hardy I995, fig. I. 14 Kramrisch I986, 227 ff.; Shukla 1993, 218-220. Hardy (2002) cites Doris Srinivasan (1990) in support of a downward and outward movement. Srinivasan (I990, I08, 142), in fact, defines a hierarchy of manifestations with the most sacred or divine (transcendent) at the top and the more "earthly" (material) at the bottom, which she reads as a "downward I79</page><page sequence="4">tectural form, at least it was not so noted by Kramrisch or Shukla.14 In Vedic symbolism as well the triangle with apex upward is considered " fire, " which normally rises. R. Soekmono describes the deity's descent into the cella along the central vertical axis in relation to vault stones with a hole (figs. 3 a, 3b) that create a hollow shaft along this axis between a roof chamber and the cella of some shrines.15 In any case the expansion is associated with a movement from the cella outward (fig. 4). Downward move- ment is always the inherent complement in the visual experience. Kramrisch herself noted that a central problem of understanding the Hindu temple is that the structure is conceptualized from the inside, yet visualized from the outside.16 Kramrisch used the term visualization to mean "perceived visually from the exterior" as part of the darsana (mode of worship) and noted that conceptualization and visualization were not of the same order. Both aspects need to be considered and distinguished. It is useful to further clarify this observation, as visualization and conceptualization are also interrelated. Kramrisch used the terms to signify the dominant aspect of two experiences or processes. While darsana also involves concepts and conceptualization, looking at or seeing the temple, its form and its surfaces, is the distinctive factor in this mode of worship. In con- trast, conceptualization is the distinctive factor in the creative process of designing or planning the temple form, aided by mental visualization. This conceptualization of the form in the planning stages prior to construction is critical, as aspects of the conceptualization, particularly ordering notions that regulate the combination of several formal models into one composition, must be clearly formulated to enable coordination during the making of the forms. Kramrisch's observation draws attention to the fact that not only is the temple laid out on the site starting with the sanctum as the center, but its form is conceptualized from the inside outward with reference to the sanctum. Although the com- pleted temple will be experienced from the outside inward, the understanding of the inside-outward conceptualization is important to the reading of the architectural form and thus informs this study. The study of Sanskrit terms and their use in describing historic architecture has been challenged by some scholars, particularly those whose research focuses on current practice.17 While it is impossi- ble to know how such terminology was applied in historical situations, and it may or may not be applied in the same way today, studying the possible meanings in relation to formal compositions - in which it is possible to read hierarchies and wholes and subdivisions of architectural form from the form alone - can help develop an understanding of the form. The terminology can be a tool to the investigation and, when definitions are clarified, is useful in descriptions (as the work of Meister, progression from transcendency to materiality." These stages she associated with iconographic elements on the exte- rior of the temple. It would also be possible to read the hierarchy as an ascendance starting at the bottom. It could be noted that a downward reading suited Hardy's (2002) method of using a diagram in which the center represented the top and the outer bands the lower tiers of the form. Such geometric diagrams, or " roof plans," are useful tools for archi- tectural analysis: the center is the top of the form. But the center of the mandala is the brahmasthana, corresponding to the cella of the temple. Thus there are at least two ways to read such geometric diagrams. I5 Soekmono I995, io0-i2 and 31. Such a vault stone, with its lotus motif, was seen on the Candi Merak site in Java in 2001. Briggs' (I951I, fig. I0) section of a shrine in the Sambor Prei Kuk South group (in Cambodia) shows such a hol- low shaft below the central finial in a valabhi (ridged vault) roof form. I6 Kramrisch I986, 359.

This is no doubt why such terminology evolved. Terminology is used in this study as a tool for the analysis of aspects of formal concepts. Form analysis, however, is based primarily on the reading of the com- positional arrangement of forms as architectural wholes, and aggregated architectural wholes. ASPECTS OF MOVEMENT Hardy's analysis of the temple forms ofKarnataka led him to identify eight modes of expressing move- ment: I)projection, 2)staggering, 3) splitting, 4) bursting of boundaries, )progressive multiplication, 6)excpand- ing repetition, )pictorial representation, and 8) gyration.19 While some of these categories, e.g. projection, reflect an internal conceptualization, and he refers to the emanation of forms, his introductory state- ments reveal that his approach was primarily from the point of view of a visitor, a "visualization" from the outside. His categories also reflect his emphasis on both formal composition and style. While all eight terms could be evaluated in relation to the distinction between conceptualization and visuali- zation, staggering is the one which poses the most difficult ambiguities. It is important to note that staggering is defined by Hardy as multiple projections and progressive expansion.20 However, much of his discussion seems to be pegged to external impressions, for example, that these closely spaced edges create the impression that the form is vibrating with inner energy which, Hardy notes, citing corre- spondence with Dhaky, is recognized in the texts and is termed spanda.2 Progressive expansion in a rhythmic mode, like a pulse, would be the appropriate mode for conceptualized generation of the form. The various experiences of the devotee, arising at times strictly from ritual order and a concen- trated mind and at times more randomly, could render a more erratic impression of the temple. The term staggering can, in general, connote faltering, haphazard, uncontrolled movement, mov- ing first one way and then another. Radhika Srinivasan also used the term to explain the dynamics of the temple form.22 She, in fact, demonstrated the notion of staggering with a dance movement in which one foot remained stationary while the other moved forward with a lunging motion. The qual- ity of such a movement would be largely determined by the rhythm or timing, and by the emotive aspects of the dancer's posture or gesture. It is thus important to note that the mandalas, which regu- late the temple forms, are primarily proportional systems and a mode of rhythmic control of the tem- ple form.23 Kramrisch states that the Samaranggnalasutradhdra, as well as the Matsya Pzurdna and the Visvakarmaprakdsa, mention "staged" or "phased" bhadra.24 The notion of phased expansion accu- 19 Hardy 1995,19-22. 20 Ibid., 21; Iyer and Hardy 2002. 21 Spanda can be beneficial (like a pulse or life-giving vibration), destructive, or inauspicious (Monier-Williams 1986, I268). 22 National University of Singapore School of Architecture's Guest Lecture Series on the topic of the Hindu temple and the arts, including dance. The exact date of the talk, ca. 1994-1996, was not available, but it is possible that Srini- vasan had read Hardy's 1995 work. 23 Indorf 2002b. 24 Kramrisch 1986, 420. Bhadra are projecting elements seen as " off-sets " in the wall and which may, if sufficiently pro- jected, create a cross form plan. Multiple-staged projections from the center create the form sometimes described as "redented" in scholarly works on Southeast Asian architecture. Kramrisch (I986, 4I9) notes that only by counting the I8I</page><page sequence="6">rately describes movement conceptualized as a progressive, gnomonic expansion, comparable to a dancer moving forward or moving one leg forward in deliberately timed and measured steps. Even in later stages of engagement, a process initiated by visualization, pleasure can result from the under- standing of or the resolution of the visual impressions into a harmonious pattern, perceived both intel- lectually and as a felt rhythm. This could also contribute to darsana, the objective of which is oneness with the divine, a direct cognition of Truth. In Kramrisch's interpretation, the text specifies that the sequence of rhythm employed during con- struction is laid outward from the center, then along its perimeter; from there it acquires visibility on the outside of the building by rising upward "in gradations of its planes. "25 According to D. N. Shukla, the text actually specifies this in a fourfold classification of modes of rhythm, translated as: pra-ma, forth measure; abhi-ma, peri-meter; prati-ma, counter-measure; and un-ma, upward measure.26 While this text formula does not address the principle of cyclical return, nor even the stage of descent of divine energy into the garbhagrha (cella), it is very clear about the stage of extension from the center of the garbhagrha (in the first instance) outward in all directions.27 In this it seems directly relevant to the conceptualization as Kramrisch described it, "from the inside outward. " Other aspects of this formula relate to proportionate measurement and will be discussed below. Recognition of radial and bilateral symmetries in the ordered distribution of elements is a prime clue to the visual recognition of the center(s) hidden within the building fabric. Evaluating architec- tural detail is the key to recognizing these centers and thus the hierarchically ordered expansion schema. The dominance of the outward and upward in the conceptualization of the extension of the temple (i.e. planning or design of the form) is also borne out by architectural detail in the false storeys of shrines in Southeast Asia, for example in the Khmer (figs. 5a, 5b) and Javanese shrines, where wall detail in the superstructure's false storey is not simply a small replica of the whole wall, but generally only the top portion, being abruptly cut as though still embedded in the lower form while in the process of emerging.28 The same notion is seen in the Cham shrine of Hoa Lai in Vietnam, especially in the outward-facing surfaces of three-stage bhadras and the inner core, thus giving four facades per side, can one reconcile the prescriptions of a sixteen-sided mandapa. 25 Ibid., 232. 26 Shukla(I993, 2I9) also cites the Apastamba Srauta Sutra (4:5.4): "with the sacrifice's forth-measure (pra-ma), peri-meter (abhi-ma), counter-measure (prati-ma), I comprise thee. " This is recited when the vedi (altar) is outlined on the ground with the wooden sacrificial sword. He also cites: "This measure [of life] man measures for (pra), off(apa), apart (vi), out (nir), up (ut), together (sam), so that when he has measured it, it is said of him that he has gone to heaven" (Athara Veda I8.2.39-45). Kramrisch (I986) has demonstrated the parallel between the vedi and the temple. 27 Beginning from the first established center through the drawing of the first square, i.e. the establishment of the unit of measure, it is only possible to go outward and upward with visible form. However, the temple is conceptualized as, and its foundation construction also reflects, a downward extension in the temple pit below the cella. 28 The eminent archaeologist and architect Jacques Dumarcay (I992; 2003) has attributed this feature to the builders' consciousness of perspective. As the parts could not be seen, the detail was omitted. In some cases, the detail is actu- ally visible and a reason consistent with the logic of the doctrinal conceptualization would seem more compelling. In cases where the lower detail is carried out as a full form, it can be argued that the form as seen (or sized) is a propor- tioned whole, a systematically reduced whole, no longer half hidden. That this part of the detail would be left out for convenience also does not explain why in so many other situations, great care is given to a detail that is partially or I82</page><page sequence="7">south tower where the aedicules on the side of the bhadra are abruptly cut off at the junction with the inner or core form of the shrine (fig. 6). In several research projects, one in relation to Bagan shrines and others related toJavanese and other Southeast Asian shrines,29 dynamic three-dimensional models were constructed and led to a better understanding of the specifics of the "expanding cube" dynamics of the Hindu-Buddhist temple.3? Through those efforts, it became clear that the path or sequence of movement of the various second- ary components emerging from the core was not necessarily always the same and that the determina- tion or specification of each as a staged process would have been important in the conceptualization of the form. This in turn determines certain aspects of architectonic detail of secondary elements, par- ticularly their treatment when junctions of two forms occur, each being an architectural "whole." As is evident in the Hoa Lai towers, for example, the integrity of a "whole" is clear when a complete for- mal component carries all its details as ordered from its own center (see figs. 6,7a,7b). In assessing the dynamic model of the staged bhadra and karna , these details and the disposition of wall planes are critical in establishing and understanding the model. It is the wall plane that distinguishes staged bhadra with karna or strong corner pilaster articulation centered on the cardinal direction from aprati- bhadra at a sub-cardinal direction.32 In certain contexts, as shown by Hardy, the corner articulation or pilaster is detailed as a kutastambha (pillar with aedicular articulation at the top) and is thus trans- formed from a secondary component (pilaster) into an architectonic whole, sometimes reading verti- wholly hidden behind another element or is placed so high that no one could possibly see it clearly. It can be agreed, however, that Dumarcay's attribution of an awareness of perspective on the part of the Indian and Southeast Asians following Indian traditions is borne out by the system itself, in proportionate reductions and in the use or manipula- tion of scale, which he also discusses, but not necessarily in this particular detail. 29 "Bagan Shrines" was a National University of Singapore (NUS)-funded project completed in 2002. Although Bagan's shrines are nearly all Buddhist, they draw on the same formal language and notions as the Hindu tradition. The study of other Southeast Asian shrines was facilitated through NUS-funded projects; one was entitled " Pancaratha"; another, SEACOR, was a joint collaboration with SOK of the University of Bonn, with T. S. Maxwell of Bonn (funded by the German Research Council and the Alice Boner Foundation of Zurich) and P. IndorfofSingapore as collaborating prin- cipal investigators. The study ofJavanese shrines was conducted as part of "Dance and the Temple," which was funded by the Getty Grant Program (2000-2002), with technical support for the model construction work done in Singa- pore provided by NUS School of Architecture. "Dance and the Temple" was an international collaborative project initiated by A. Iyer of London. Other collaborators included Terry Braun (London), John Miksic (Singapore), P. In- dorf (Singapore), and Edi Sedyawati (Jakarta). See also Iyer and Hardy 2002. 30 The work of construction was done by NUS students (Nicki Teo, Teo Hui Leong, Kang Fong Ing, Law Li Peng, Upali Nanda, and others) and supervised by Pinna Indorf. 3I Bhadra are projections located at the center of a side of the cella. Karna are similar projections but are located at the corner of the core form. 32 In some works any off-set in the temple wall on the side of the central projection is considered to be apratibhadra (flanking or reflected bhadra), located between the bhadra and the corner or karna. However, if bhadra is understood in terms of an architectural whole, then it requires two corners, one on either side of the central bhadra (or center of the side), to make that whole and the center of the form to which the flanking corners belong are indeed the same as the center of the bhadra. Thus off-sets can be seen as stages of that projection, each pair a whole instead of each side a separate whole. A projecting whole centered at the intermediate point with both corners visible to one side of the bhadra is then a "prati-bhadra" (cf. Indorf 200ooI a, figs. I2a and I3 a). Terminology, of course, has a way of slipping away from its root meanings and the terms themselves are not so important as recognizing the formal distinctions. I83</page><page sequence="8">cally across the various levels of the temple.33 Hardy also shows a dynamic model for the dynamics of the staged bhadra (with multiple off-sets) having first a radial movement from the center, and then secondary movements at right angles to the centerline of the bhadra to create those inner off-sets.34 The movement pattern of Hoa Lai's north tower vestibule follows a similar pattern. The disposition of the double arch form alone makes it clear it is a cross-axis projection (secondary bhadra) of a sepa- rate "whole," which has as its point of origin the center of the first projection form (e.g. the vestibule). This is because it is not centered on the exposed wall face (see (see fig. 7a). The forms of the two arches of the Hoa Lai bhadra are the same and, as moving forms, are both aligned on the same axis with the same point of origin. Hardy's diagrammatic model implies (but does not indicate) two such centers for cross- axis projection. However, in the architectural details in his plates this sideways dynamic seems to apply clearly only to a secondary component above the bhadra, 3 viz., in the 6vlabh-form sal.6 The cross- axial (sideways) dynamic is evident in the valabhz roof detail at each false storey,37 but not necessarily in the bhadra at the level of the cella, nor even its eaves (kapota). A similar aedicular form (valabhi-sali) can also be seen in Sambor Prei Kuk motifs (see fig. 8). There is also a gavaksa facing outward (pro- jecting from the side of the vault of the aedicular form) and, as the ridges seem to be equal, the roof form thus appears to be two valabhz forms arranged on crossed axes, i.e. a caturmuZkha form half embed- ded in the facade of a bhadra overdoor.38 This formal arrangement in the parapet detail is, therefore, conceptually a roof-terrace chamber ofcaturmukha form with an extension to two sides (i.e. the aedic- ular form's axis of projection is parallel to the facade plane of the core of the temple). It is above the kapota, which Hardy notes belongs to the wall of the core form or bhadra below.39 Between the eaves (kapita) and the valabhz forms there is sometimes a motif of crossed beams that end in makara heads, indicating a terrace level.40 The valabhhz form is clearly a sa9d on a roof terrace above a bhadra, e.g. a three-stage bhadra, for example in the Naganatha temple ofLakkundi.41 It becomes a matter of inter- pretation whether those valabhi-fSV are meant as roof elements replicating the form of the bhadra (rep- resented in the wall off-sets). Together they thus create a complete aedicule of chaturmukha form with one lateral bhadra at each end of the vault form (with its axis parallel to the temple farade plane). While the architectural detail would allow this interpretation, it is not absolutely conclusive. In the context 33 Hardy zoo002, 88, 95. 34 Hardy 1995, 2i and figs.

In the Jain temple at Lakkundi (ibid., pi. 44) two sloping courses below the valabhi motif may merge the roof with the bhadra below; however, there seems to be a cross-log railing motif here as well, which could signal a separation. 36 A similar detail is seen in the aedicular motifs on Sambor Prei Kuk shrines. 37 For example, see the Kallesvara temple at Kukkanur (Hardy 1995, pl. 43). 38 If the cross-vault ridges were not equal, it would read as a single vault (valabhlz-sald) with a bhadra extending on each side and each end. 39 Hardy 1995, 59, n. 24. 40 The cross-beam or cross-log is one type of structural support for a floor or platform or small building but could also be used as a terrace railing. It is difficult to distinguish all details in the published photo, but sometimes the detail is not without its own ambiguities. 4I See Hardy I995, fig. 46.

It relies on reading the off-sets across the levels as a single dynamic pattern, i.e. a secondary (replica of the) "core," which then expands laterally and vertically from its own center. It is not always the case, however, that the dynamics of the body and the roof of a single form are identical in their movement rhythm. The rhythm pattern may allow for an increase or decrease in inten- sity, i.e. an increase or decrease in the number of projection stages or aedicular elements as well as a change in the vocabulary of forms in different stages. Thus Hardy's model diagram indicates in only a general way the pattern of movement.42 In a detailed analysis of a particular form, the staging of a sequence according to a hierarchy of centers of movement, expressed in the architectural detail, must be identified to accurately understand the form composition. This example also shows that the archi- tectural detail is not always without ambiguities, particularly when the emerging form does not ade- quately emerge to show specific details. Possible movement sequences as well as details associated with formal wholes are critical to a clear understanding of the architectural hierarchies. The two shrines remaining at Hoa Lai show two slightly different movement patterns of badhra stages in their details. Hoa Lai's north shrine vestibule shows two successive phases of movement: I) the bhadra housing the vestibule emerges from the cella, and z) an aedicular form (a two-stage bhadra) emerges from the side of the vestibule, ordered by the center of the first bhadralvestibule on a cross-axis (fig. 7a). The bhadras on the other sides of the cella (figs. 7 a and 7b) show two stages, the second being a repetition of the first. Hoa Lai's south shrine, as mentioned above, shows this type of two-stage movement in its vestibule, with both stages related to the center of the cella and on the same cardinal axis (fig. 6). However, each of the two partially hidden aedicular motifs on the sides of the vestibule emerge from the center of the respective stages which they adorn.43 These examples show that attention to the disposition of planes and details with reference to an architectonic whole is crit- ical to interpreting the clues of the ordering pattern. An analysis of temple forms from some of the regional traditions of India reveals that the disposi- tion of their elements can be understood as the result of different conceptualized movement sequences and resultant hierarchies. Thus it seems that attention to the conceptualized movement revealed in aedicular elements and their details can help clarify aspects of formal order and architectural compo- sition unique to the regional tradition. The following observations do not attempt to address all the forms of each tradition but those that appear, on a purview of the material, as the more typical fea- tures. In Pallava, Chola, and Calukya temples, hara are composed ofsdal- and kuta-aedicules just above the kapota courses. However, in the rendering of the details, the architectonic readings of "wholes" are 42 Hardy I995, fig. 6. 43 There is a third complete aedicule on a pilaster at the corner. In its ruined state the details of the vestibule are not without ambiguity, particularly at the cornice level and in an uncharacteristically small corner pilaster on the inner stage of the extension. Aedicules at Hoa Lai are generally found at the base of a pilaster, thus these two may appear as wall aedicules, but some evidence points to their being on pilasters or pillars that do not relate clearly to the normal architectonic arrangement of elements. The reading of architectural form would be somewhat different depending on what was intended. 197</page><page sequence="22">somewhat different. In Pallava shrines, the horizontal articulation of storey is dominant whether or not an aedicular motif is carried across the storey divisions by off-sets in the kapota and pilaster or pro- jection alignments. Dharmaraja Ratha of Mahabalipuram is an example of storey-by-storey applica- tion of an aedicular motif(fig. 9). Its kapota articulation (off-sets) corresponds with aedicule in the hara above and pairs of pilasters in the wall of the false storey below.44 This establishes an aedicular motif at each level for each false storey emerging upward from the form below. The number ofshala-aedicules in the hara of each level is different, being 3, 2, and I from the lower to upper levels. The primary move- ment is upward and the lateral movement (primarily disposition of aedicule in this case) is secondary related to each level. In other Pallava forms, e.g. Arjuna Ratha (fig. IO) and the Shore temple (figs. II a, Iib), also at Mahabalipuram, there is some correspondence of aedicular articulation across the differ- ent storeys, with the number of aedicules in the hara equal at successive levels. Yet this alignment is not emphasized; the horizontal storey division dominates the composition and, one might argue, reflects a conceptual priority on vertical (bhadrapztha) expansion, with lateral expansion determined level by level, although the proportional reduction and repetition allow a degree of vertical legibility of forms. Chola temples mix alignment and non-alignment of aedicular elements across the storeys. The pilaster pairs andt the wall plane between the ae different plane from the walls to the sides of the pair, thus defining a projecting form a bit more clearly and expressing some of the aedicular motifs through a number of storeys (fig. 12). The mode of expansion in Chola shrines, as in Pallava, can be read or conceptualized as primarily upward, with small secondary aedicular forms emerging level by level, resulting in the dominance of the horizontal. However, in the Chola temples the slightly more visible multi-storey aedicular forms seem to point toward the conceptualization of a lateral expansion of larger wholes (across two or more levels). In the Calukya temples and northern schools, e.g. at Khajuraho and Osian (figs. I3 a, 13 b, 14), the vertical reading of aedicular form is more dominant; hhadra are multistorey aedicular forms. The Calukya and some northern schools such as the Candella give priority to the lateral extension or emergence of new (secondary) centers from which the second- ary forms begin a new phase of upward expansion and may also spawn a new lateral extension as yet another new center of expansion. This results in the clustering of tower forms typical of Khajuraho (figs. 13 a, I3b) and of Karnataka shrines as documented by Hardy. Osian temples show another interpretation, as they have relatively simple bhadra articulation of the body and a more elaborate superstructure (fig. I4). The bhadra of the body is carried up through the superstructure, but with a more elaborate development (intensification) of the lateral expansion theme in the superstructure in the form of karnakuta, as well as the elaboration of false storeys, result- ing in six tiers of karnakta above the plain corner of the body. The corners of the inner-stage bhadra in the superstructure do not clearly show additional lateral expansion; however, the presence of the amalaka motif in this band also implies karnakuta. Another, somewhat similar pattern of articulation and movement hierarchies can be seen in the Kalinga-style temples of Bhubanesvara, e.g. the Parasuramesvara temple.45 The body of the shrine (south side) has a single bhadra (one lateral projec- tion) flanked by two ratha-form aedicules resting on apratibhadra of the plinth.46 These are complete 44 Note that the wall articulation is related to the aedicule above it, not the one directly in front of it. 45 Meister, Dhaky, and Deva 1988, pls. 510-I19 and plan fig. IOI. 46 That is, a lateral projection centered at the intermediate point between the bhadra and the corner of the cella. 198</page><page sequence="23">forms terminating below the cella's eaves. Above the cella's eaves, the superstructure has additional lateral projections, namely karna. The bhadra, a single stage at cella level, has three stages in the super- structure; the inner stage has karna while the intermediate forms (flanking off-sets) are too small to read as karna, though the gavcksa may indicate their presence. Only the central panel repeats the fron- ton motif of the bhadra. The hierarchies here seem to be composed of a simple lateral extension that expands upward, with intensified lateral expansion at upper levels. On the other hand, Chaturbuja temple of Khajuraho (fig. I3 a) can be seen as having a three-stage bhadra each side with a pillar-like articulation at the corner of each stage as well as at the corners of the cella; this development contin- ues into the superstructure with the fronton motif repeated in all latd. Those at the corners could per- haps be compared to the kZtastambha of Karnataka temples as Hardy defined them.47 The five central latdi have slightly different details and seem to allow a reading of a single form comprised of a staged bhadra, two inner stages of the same pattern,48 and a third, outer stage finished with a larger version of the pattern while, at the cella level, the bhadra supports a niche having an aedicular surround crowned by a fronton at the eaves level. The Mahakosala style as represented by the Laksmana temple of Sirpur shows multiple lateral extensions of staged bhadra and karna, each with additional projec- tions and an intensification of lateral projections in the superstructure. All read vertically across the entire structure.49 The alignment of planes50 and recognition of elements that relate to formal wholes allow for a reconstruction of the sequenced ordering of expansion centers. Architectural detail reveals the ordering hierarchies and thus also determines the reading of archi- tectural wholes, as seen in the superstructure of Candi Siva, Prambanan, Java (figs. 2a, 2b). Entabla- ture articulation at Candi Siva allows us to distinguish the "bhadra' in the superstructure as being false storeys of the core or of the projecting secondary shrines (housed in the bhadra). But it is not always easy to make such distinctions. Multiple off-sets can be seen as staged movement of a bhadra all related to the same center, thus one bhadra emerging in stages (see figs. 6, 7a, 7b, 13 a). To clarify, this can perhaps be compared to the dance bas reliefs on Candi Siva of Prambanan since Alessandra Iyer has demonstrated that the depiction of three figures partially superimposed in each of the karana bas reliefs on the balustrade shows, in fact, three positions in the movement (comprising one karana) of one indi- vidual dancer (see fig. i).5I However, architectural detail can sometimes tell a different story. The dif- ferent stages may be rendered as completely different architectural forms. In another variation, the two may have similar detail, but one is "split" to allow the second to emerge (e.g. in bhadra of Bagan shrines, fig. I5, and in roof forms of Khmer "libraries," fig. I6). The relationship of parts and wholes is carefully ordered as related to centers of architectural wholes, primary and secondary. Each bhadra is a response to a "conceptual model "52 comprised of a primary form model, modifying form models, and 47 Hardy I995. 48 Their superstructures of the type of gavksa lace Hardy (I995) has explained as movement involving "splitting." 49 See Meister, Dhaky, and Deva I988, pl. 464. 50 Alignment of planes is sometimes difficult to see in photos or even in the structure itself. Correct architectural plans are a critical tool. See plans for Laksmana, Sirpur and Parasuramesvara, Bhubanesvara, in ibid., figs. 89 and IOI respectively. 5I Iyer I998. 52 The term " conceptual model" was coined during the study of Southeast Asian architecture to refer to a design or pro- totype for a new religious form or structure based on selection, combination, and variations of a range of formal ele- ments and ordering patterns within the architectural language of a tradition (Indorf I99I; I999). I99</page><page sequence="24">ordering models following an ordered movement pattern. When secondary forms relate to a center other than the core or inner sanctum, a new complete aedicule is defined. A change in architectonic detail can signal that different nested forms are emerging in sequenced phases. On the other hand, the same detail on successive off-sets could signify one form in the process of moving outward. The controlling schema of phased or staged dynamics is that of the gnomonic principle generally found in the theory and the mandalas of the tradition as an emanation at the center and expansion "to the four directions." The core form first expands to the four directions, from the original cube of the inner sanctum. As a bhadra (bhadrapZtha) emerges from the core it may in turn become the "origin" of additional expansion to the four directions from its own center. Staged bhadra, creating a series of off-sets, seem to move outward incrementally, in proportional measure, within the scheme - a con- cept aligned with gnomonic growth. The first phase of movement is ordered from the core's center; the secondary growth is from the first-phase component's center and in relation to its own center. One might question the importance of such fine-tuned interpretations of architectural form as the hierarchy of a conceptualized movement sequence for emerging secondary forms within the compo- sition. That importance will of course depend on the purpose or objective of the analysis. The sequence of movement may be important to the investigation of rhythm as ordered proportional measure, which could have been embodied in the mandala and the temple archetypes.53 While these interpretations could contribute to stylistic and historical development studies, they are definitely important in mak- ing these monuments more accessible within the domain of architectural thought. ASPECTS OF MEASUREMENT This discussion of bhadra illustrates the implications of considering the form of the temple as an aggre- gated whole composed of smaller wholes, each a complete architectural model and all in the process of moving rhythmically outward from the center of the cella or from a secondary center. The study of bhadra has also shown the importance of terminology in revealing significant aspects or associated con- cepts.54 Various terms are used to refer to bhadra. Some emphasize the formal concepts (e.g. bhadra- sald and ratha), while others address the disposition of the component within the composition, viz., "bhadra" as an extension along a central, cardinal axis, and "prati-bhadra" as an extension at a point between the central projection and the corner.55 This also has implications in relation to the termi- nology of measurement, introduced earlier as the four modes of development of rhythm in the com- position (pra-ma, abhi-md, prati-md, and un-md). While it is appropriate to re-evaluate these terms for possible architectural significance, the importance of proportional measurement goes beyond aes- 53 For example, through allocation of deities to the padas and the ratio ofpadas in the three zones of the mandala. 54 Indorf zooIa. 55 The termprati-bhadra is commonly used to mean any off-set flanking the bhadra. However, it may be possible to argue that as the bhadra is a cardinally ordered or anchored expansion, the aspect of"prati" (reflected, flanking, counter) may or could apply to the datum of order just as karna-bhadra is an expansion anchored or ordered by the corner (cf. Indorf 2ooia). While the terminology itself is not so important, what is important in this context is the distinction of two, three, or more ordering centers in the formal composition, cardinal, sub-cardinal, and intermediate. 200</page><page sequence="25">thetics, having a "fundamental metaphysical implication. "56 This metaphysical implication is reflected in the numerological dimensions of the various measurement formulae. One aspect of this is seen in the tradition of allocating deities to thepadas of the mandala,57 which use various formulae for the num- ber of deities and the number and disposition ofpadas allocated to a deity. The allocation of deities is a direct reflection of iconographic significance within a hierarchical set of deities and the number of padas within a given arrangement translates into proportions or ratios employed in the proportionate measurement system for the architectural composition.58 Such formulae associated with particular mandalas address the needs of a particular construction or situation. For example, dyddi-sad-varga or six chandas (rhythms/proportions) address the auspicious proportions of the building by way of six main components of the temple form.59 However, there must be overarching measurement strategies such as the fourfold modes of rhythmic order mentioned above in order to coordinate the whole in the design and construction processes. Thus it is appropriate to return to the four modes of rhythm mentioned above and translated by Shukla: pra-ma forth measure abhi-ma peri-meter prati-ma counter-measure un-ma upward measure In an investigation of the meaning of and types of bhadra,6? terms relevant to this prescribed pattern were studied and the following alternative or additional meanings or connotations of three of these terms should be considered in the context of the processes known for setting out the temple:6I pra-md manifest measure (establish orientation and unitary square) abhi-mad scaled, developed measure (proportional, gnomonic growth) prati-mda counter-measure in the sense of "reflected" measure (symmetry) un-ma upward measure In the Brihat Samhita,62 pra meant "to fix in location." Shukla's term "forth measure" could mean "moving outward," as Kramrisch described it, but it could also mean "to bring forth," as in a mani- festation that is initiated by the establishment of orientation and the unit of measure for the temple, 56 Shukla I993, 205-207; cf. Kramrisch I986, 43. 57 For examples, see Kramrisch I986, 85-97. 58 Indorf 2002b. 59 As listed by Shukla (I993,211) these are: adhistana (base) ;padalstambha (column) ;prastara (entablature); karna ("ear," thus corners or wings); sikhara (roof or superstructure); stfpi (dome or finial, crowning form of the temple). 60 Indorf 200Ia. 6I That is, establishing the orientation and unit of measure with the gnomon and use of the unit of measure in the man- dala. 62 According to Monier-Williams I986, 70I. 201</page><page sequence="26">the basis or datum of rhythm. This is accomplished through the use of the gnomon and the mandala system.63 The extension by gnomonic growth outward is covered by abhi-ma, as abhi means " to go for- ward"64 if measure is an action; however, it can also mean increased detail or refinement.65 Thus it could mean to take the measurement outward from the measurement outward from the center, but it may be more generic than that, a ref- erence to extending measurement to all detail development of the temple elements through rhythmic sequences. Prati-ma could also refer to symmetry, the primary compositional device used in develop- ing the temple form, as reflectplication or reflection, i.e. rhythmic distribution of elements. Un-md, in this context, would be the rhythmic pattern or sequences of heights. These four terms then cover the full establishment and rhythmic extension of the form into a three-dimensional form, not in terms of elements or architectural components, not in specifics, but in generic actions; and not not necessarily as a linear process, but as strategies which are applied again and again. In this sense also, the notion of planes (as expressed by Kramrisch) is not inherent in these terms. What moves upward is the whole form (or forms), conceptually just as it moves outward and upward in the construction process, which starts with the cella.7 Thus, just as the bhadra as a whole move outward in stages, false storeys (bhadrapZtha) also move upward in stages. Secondary aedicular forms also " move outward " to their appropriate loca- tion. All this must happen in a measured way. These four modes of rhythm are echoed in the following six-fold classification of measurements, which Shukla interprets or translates as indicated:68 I. mdna measurement; also aydmd, dyata, dirgha 2. pramana breadth 3. parimdna circumference; also vistara, tdra, striti, vistriti, vistrita, vydsa, vis-rita, tata, viskamba, 4. lamba-mdna measurement along plumb-lines; also sutra, unmita 5. unmdna thickness or diameter; also bahala, ghana, miti, uhcchhrdya, tunga, unnata, udaya, utsedha, ucca, niskrama, niskrti, nirgama, nirgati, udgama 6. upamdna measurement of interspace, i.e. antara; also nZvra, vivara 63 Kramrisch 1986, 49ff; Acharya 1980, sheets I and 2. 64 Monier-Williams I986, 6I. 65 The perimeter may thus be conceived as moving outward ("to go forward "), but not as moving around; that is a visu- alization. When the perimeter moves around, the body of the temple moves with it, and the result is stellation (for example see Meister I98I-I982; Hardy 1995, fig. 18; Kalyanamitra 1982). Abhi can also be understood as going forward in terms of increasingly advanced detail, for example, as it is used in the term Abbidhamma in reference to the part of the Buddhist canon dealing with philosophical points in systematic detail. 66 See Weyl I952 or March and Steadman 197I for forms of symmetry. These principles were followed when composing bhadra, wall aedicules, niches, wall sculpture, as well as superstructure elements such as acroteria. 67 The descent of divine energy would have already taken place and thus would be resident in the center of the cella (cf. Soekmono 1995) when expansion begins. 68 Shukla I993, zo7. 202</page><page sequence="27">Shukla notes that these terms, or his chosen translation terms, are generally more relevant to sculp- ture than to architecture. However, the alternative Sanskrit terms he lists for each seem to imply a dif- ferent or broader application for at least some of the terms and some are directly relevant to architec- ture. That Sanskrit terms have various meanings is of course well known, and it is important to keep questioning the range of implications even when an apparently serviceable translation is offered and particularly as the formulae may apply in different contexts. Kramrisch, for example, translates mncna as "proportion. "69 The alternative terms listed by Shukla imply b as is of measurement (aya- md), something to depend on or adhere to (tyata), or something high and enduring over a long period oftime (dzrgha).70 Interestingly, when studying the definitions in Monier-Williams for the alternative terms given,7I one finds that many have the meaning or at least connotation of expansion, going outward to all direc- tions (striti, vistara, vistrita; all with the root " vi") or becoming visible (nirgati) or relate to multiplicity, being manifold (bahala). It is also to be noted that while unmana can mean both measure of altitude or longitude, un-md means only the measure of height, and several of the alternate terms forparimdna also imply breadth. This mitigates the tendency to view the categories of measurements as only rele- vant to orthographic planes or one notion of measurement. These categories make good sense in archi- tectural terms if one considers them in relation to "vastu'" as "composition", as Boner suggests,72 and in that context, considers the composition to be an aggregated arrangement of "wholes," i.e. arche- typal models of wholes, as for example Hardy does in his study of Karnataka temples.73 Thus, in archi- tectural applications, the categories could be defined as follows: I. mana - measurement principles or a selected standard of proportional measurement in general which will be applied to the temple. 2. pramadna - establishment of the particular standard for an application, i.e. fixing it in place on the site along with the orientation of the proposed temple (complex), establishing the orientation, a specific unit of measure and rhythm or specific proportional patterns. 3. parimdna - strategies for the systematic expansion of structure, form, and enclosure as well as artic- ulation of divisions or subdivision of form elements or components; strategies or schema for dis- position of components (movement patterns and hierarchies). 4. lamba-mdna - establishment of levels or heights of critical levels such as terraces and entablatures. For example, successive heights are generally prescribed as a ratio or proportion related to the lower element or storey. 5. unmdna - coordination of heights and lateral extension (thickness or diameter) for disposition of repetitive elements (bhadra, ratha, etc.) as well as wall thickness. Kramrisch translates this term as "vertical section"; such aspects are often determined in sections, and height-to-thickness ratios have structural importance. 69 Kramrisch (I986, 230) cites Samaranganasutradhara, chap. 49. 70 Monier-Williams I986. 71 Ibid. 72 Boner et al. I986, introduction. 73 Hardy I995; 2002. 203</page><page sequence="28">6. upamana - measurements for the establishment of secondary elements such as eaves and hara (para- pet) elements, as spacing intervals are an important aspect of the disposition of these elements. Shukla also presents two further terms for measurements: odimdna (primary measurement) and ganyamana (comparative height), which can be important when the above six categories of measure- ment are applied to an architectural project.74 Interpreted in this way these six categories of measure- ment would allow builders to plan and coordinate measurements in preliminary and actual detail con- struction stages of the work without elaborate drawings, i.e. in the oral tradition. A MODEL Incorporating aspects from the earlier works cited above (especially Hardy),75 it is now possible to pro- pose a specific model for the analysis of form composition. Since a primary goal of the form composi- tion is to express the expansion of divine energy, this is in effect a model for understanding the dis- position of components based on conceptualized dynamics of the composition. Architectural compo- nents hierarchically ordered to suit (and/or express) the iconographic program of the temple are conceptualized as moving outward from the cella in ordered and rhythmic sequences. In the simple temple forms, conceptualized movement of components may be limited to door or niche surrounds, images, acroteria, or motifs such as nisika or kzdu in the superstructure. In the more complex temple forms, it will include bhadra, larger aedicular forms or elements, and even secondary shrines or mandapa. The model has five basic facets: I. Programmatic framework II. Proportional measurement schema III. Hierarchical movement schema IV. Modes of expressing movement V. Developed measurement system for all elements These can be further explained as follows. I. The iconographic program and the ritual requirements, once fixed, determine the choice of appro- priate formal elements (models), formal language (architectural types and components), and num- ber, measurement, and proportional system (mana).76 The foundation of the composition consists of three parts: I) the ritual and iconographic program; 2) architectural type(s) and components as both generic and specific "conceptual models";77 3) mdna (measurement or proportional schema). 74 Shukla I993, 207. 75 Hardy I995. 76 How these are determined requires further study. See, for example, the discussion of the relevance of texts versus the experience of the sthapati to the process in Parker's 2003 study. 77 cf. Indorfg99I; I999. 204</page><page sequence="29">II. A proportional measurement schema for the composition is encoded in a talacchanda, or ground plan, literally "rhythm of the levels,"78 based on a vdstumandala, which encodes proportion and rhythm and relates it to the iconographic program. This is pramdna, establishing the proportional framework. Expansion outward and upward from the center of the shrine involves or is ordered by four generic principles controlling the rhythm: I) pra-md - manifest measure (establishment of orientation, the unitary square, and the core or primary center of the composition); 2) abhi-md - scaled, developed measure (proportional, gnomonic growth embodied or encoded in the mandala system) in ever increasing detail to be extended to all parts of the form; 3) prati-md - counter-measure in the sense of "reflected" measure (symmetry in various modes) as a way of maintaining a sense of the hierarchy of the centers of the forms; 4) un-md - upward measure, i.e. the principles of rhythmic or proportional measurement that apply in upward development of the form. III. Descent of divine energy through an axis at the core or center of the shrine tower is presupposed in the basic schema of the expansion of form.79 Movement is primarily ordered in relation to an internal core and is defined in terms of, or expressed by means of, "whole" architectural forms of various scales. These expressions of movement are achieved by one (or both) of two primary notions, which serve as a basis or core of the expansion themes: I) projection - i.e. bhadra (cardinally ordered lateral/outward projections to the four directions)80 and superstructure false-storey (bhadrapZtha, upward projections) development as the primary mode of increasing the complexity or enlarging a form, with a "staged" or "phased" expansion sequence specifically addressing form conceptualized as incrementally, gnomonically expand- ing. Each stage of gnomonic growth preserves characteristics (proportions, in geometrical terms) of the original whole or the architectonic model ("conceptual model") of a stage or phase. 2) gyration - the plan form is generated by spinning squares or, in three-dimensional terms, archi- tectural wholes (each a particular building form, e.g. a basic shrine form or "conceptual model"), which are in turn rotated around the central axis to a different number of degrees cre- ating a multi-cornered form. This concept seems to be found in relatively few formal types, such as certain stellated temple forms in Indian traditions8" and in certain chedi (stupa) forms of Thailand. The use of rotated forms, however, may also be combined with aspects of projec- tions (bhadra). 78 Kramrisch I986, 230. 79 Ibid.; Michell I977; Soekmono I995. 80 Projection may be to multiples of the four directions: thus eight, resulting in karna (projections at corners as well as sides); or sixteen, resulting in pratibhadra (intermediate projections between corners and midpoints of the sides; cf. Indorf zooIa. 205</page><page sequence="30">IV. A number of secondary modes of expressing movement may be used to clarify and articulate the basic schema: I) splitting - seen in most traditions as split base moldings at door openings, split columns or pilasters defining niches (fig. 17),82 and split architectural forms in bhadra articulation on Bagan shrines (fig. I5) and in the roof details of Khmer libraries with valabhz form (fig. I6).83 2) bursting of boundaries - rupture of plane both as a source for the notion of independent entities and in the development of thresholds or domains. 3) progressive multiplication - in the number of elements or aedicular forms (often with numero- logical or symbolic significance) and in proportional terms. 4) expanding repetition - form models repeated, with variations in line with proportional scaling or progressive multiplication.84 5) surface rendering - which may create the impression of specific architectural components, change the spatial and proportional or rhythmic reading with motif or pattern, or alter the stylistic or aesthetic reading of the form. V. Development of a detailed measurement or proportioning system (mana) for application in con- struction, which will involve the remaining four categories of measurement:85 I) parima-na - strategies for the systematic expansion of structure, form and enclosure, as well as articulation of divisions or subdivision of form elements or components; strategies or schema for disposition of components. 2) lamba-mana - proportional means of establishing levels or heights of critical levels such as ter- races and entablatures. 3) unmana - coordination of heights and lateral extension or thickness for disposition of walls and repetitive formal elements (bhadra, ratha, etc.). 4) upamana - measurement strategies for spacing of secondary components such as eaves and hara (parapet) elements, and secondary elements of walls and plinths. Two of the above five facets of the model (facets III and IV) incorporate Hardy's eight expressions of movement.86 His first mode of form development,projection, is by far the most significant and core idea for the form of temples or shrines. Staggering (Hardy's second mode), as an aspect of projection, is absorbed into facet III. (see above). Gyration is an alternative core notion to projection in terms of the conceptualization of a formal schema, but in visualization may also be associated with projections in 8I For examples, see Meister 1981-1982. 82 There are also other situations, e.g. columns at Sambor Prei Kuk (in monument S2), where four pillars seem to be one column split into four to support a man.dapa. 83 The details of some shrines at Sambor Prei Kuk are not entirely clear and need to be studied more carefully but could have involved split forms similar to the later libraries. 84 In application the repeated model or element may (though not always, as seen in the Bagan shrines, fig. IS) grow smaller as it moves further from its regulating center, e.g. in staged bhadra. It is the whole that expands in size. However, in the South Indian temple of seven nested enclosures (prakaras), the ideal is for each successively outergopura to be larger. 85 That is, four of the six-fold system remain as one, mana, related to facet I; another,pramana, was included in facet II. zo6</page><page sequence="31">as much as they figure in the visual impression of gyrations. The next four modes in Hardy's model are significant in the development of detail which expresses the order or hierarchy of the secondary forms or the expanded form elements (see facet IV above). And finally, pictorial representation is rele- vant in the final rendering of the whole composition and the dynamics of surfaces and may play a role in formal development by ensuring an appropriate place for the intended pictorial representation, say ofjatakas or scenes from the epics (related to facets I.I-2 above). This aspect would of course include the entire iconographic program, which in architectural terms is a functional requirement of the tem- ple, enabling it to fulfill its religious function.87 Pictorial elements can also play a reinforcing role in defining the architectural wholes, for example, in the use of flying figures under bas relief ratha or "flying palaces" as seen at Tanjore (fig. I8) and Sambor Prei Kuk (fig. I9), which help identify the form as an independent whole. A floral motifcan also be used to achieve the same architectural end (fig. to). It is thus argued that the above listed five facets can form a model for effective analysis of the formal composition of Hindu (and some Buddhist) shrines or temples and many of the ancillary buildings in a religious complex. Central to this model is the notion of a dynamic body or aggregation of moving bodies, choreographed as it were, moving outward from the center of the cella according to specific ordering patterns and measurements, or proportional and rhythmic systems or sequences. 86 Projection, staggering, splitting, bursting of boundaries, progressive multiplication, expanding repetition, pictorial representation, and gyration. 87 Adequate surfaces, niches, entablatures, etc. must be provided for the necessary images and other iconic elements. 207</page><page sequence="32">CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS In analyzing the composition of the temple forms and their embodied dynamics, we must identify the range of architectural wholes (facet I.2). Within each regional tradition, a complete formal analysis will, of course, have to be based on the definition of specific elements of the formal language, just as Hardy has defined such elements in relation to the Karnataka temples, from the range available in the larger Indian tradition.88 While considerations of visual effect (visualization, from the outside) may influence detailed rendering of form, it can be argued that conceptualization (from the inside) as the dynamics of a moving body, or aggregate of moving bodies, moving outward from its own center in gnomonic and rhythmic stages is the prime basis for form generation in the Hindu temple. Not only is this core idea critical to the interpretation of architectural form, but it seems to be so also for the correct reading of related texts (Silpa- and vdstuz-sastras) and the use of mandalas to coordinate the pro- portionate measurement related to architecture. When the context of the design of these forms is kept in mind, the evaluation of Sanskrit terminology can help clarify the concepts or notions that could be behind aspects of form development. While representation and analysis of some aspects of the forms are often facilitated by reducing the three-dimensional form to a series of planes, it is critical to the understanding and appreciation of Hindu shrines and temples to identify both the architectonic wholes and the conceptualized movement of those three-dimensional wholes that comprise the temple forms. Viewed in terms which framed this proposed model, the temple types, the mandalas, and the many inter-related formulae of the texts can be seen not so much as rigid constraints but as rigorous tools in a creative system of many varied and complex parts. 88 Hardy I995. An analysis of Buddhist forms led to a similar set of models and the notion of "conceptual models" (Indorf I99I). 208</page><page sequence="33">REFERENCES Acharya, Prasanna Kumar. I980.
