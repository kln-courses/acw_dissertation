<plain_text><page sequence="1">Holland 'Wijnand Nuyen - Romantic Works' is the title of a retrospective exhibition at the Gemeentemuseum at The Hague (closed 26th February). This collection (fifty-five oils and ninety-odd drawings and water-colours) was much more than an expanded version of the first Nuyen exhibition which was held twenty-five years ago. It is, rather, a confirmation of Nuyen's successful come-back. Quite apart from the revival of interest in the Dutch Romantic School (and the rising prices at auctions), this exhibition allowed one to discover a great deal about an artist whose name is better known than his works. Wijnand Nuyen's life is a story in the best Romantic tradition. Born at The Hague in 1813 as the son of a modestly well-to-do baker, at the age of twelve his drawings were so exceptional that his father entered him as a student at the Academy of Fine Arts at The Hague, where, in 1825, he was accepted as a pupil by Schelfhout and Van Hove. His father paid the four years' tuition and was richly rewarded when, in 1829, Wijnand won the 'Felix Meritis' gold medal as well as another award, 'for encouragement', from the Academy at Ghent. In 1830 he exhibited at The Hague and in Amster- dam, where he was awarded another 'Felix Meritis' prize. In the same year he received a special honorary certificate issued by the Academy of Groningen and a commission for a series of lithographs by Desguerrois. In I836 he was appointed a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam. In 1837 he married Schelfhout's daughter and in 1838 he was dead . . . twenty-six years old. During his thirteen years as an artist he also sketched and painted while travelling fairly widely in France and Germany. Rochussen and Leickert were his pupils. His friends included Delacroix and Isabey, Bonington and Jongkind, all of whom influenced his work just as Schelfhout and Van Hove had done previously. Despite their influences he always succeeded in striking a personal note, even when copying. Nowadays we distinguish between three different Nuyens. First, there is the truly Romantic Nuyen, who is just a little different from Schelfhout and Leickert, showing a greater freedom and vitality. Then, there is the brilliant boy who, at the age of sixteen, painted a grand landscape with a view of Haarlem on the horizon, echoing Ruysdael and Philips Koninck, but in a much more modern, tender and sensitive manner. It is a canvas (54.5 by 70 cm), dominated by a magnificent blue sky with clouds sailing past, anticipating the best manner of The Hague School... half a century in advance. And lastly, there is the mature Nuyen of the beaches and landscapes (see Fig.85) which were painted a few years before his death. Despite being so reminiscent of similar works by Turner of the same period, these paintings and drawings are so personal that one is tempted to wonder whether Nuyen had ever seen Turner's wild seas. It should be added that research has not produced the slightest evidence that Nuyen ever did see a late Turner seascape. Wijnand Nuyen, who died at the age of twenty-six, was an enigma in his own day and that he remains. Jan de Jonge (1864-1927) at Pulchri Studio, The Hague (closed 2nd February) is a true discovery: a gifted, charming and sensitive Impressionist whom nobody had ever heard of, whose works nobody had ever seen. . . with the excep- tion of his relatives and friends. Another, yet totally different, romantic story: Jonkheer Johan Antoni de Jonge, born into that very exclusive circle of The Hague aristocracy and highest officials. One De Jonge was a Minister of War, another was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies and Jan's father was President of The Hague Court of Justice. It is true that his mother was a talented artist but in her case painting was merely a pleasant diversion. Jan went to Leyden to read law as a matter of course, but indulged his hobby by attending courses at the Academy at The Hague. He did not really enjoy practising law and gave it up to devote his time and energy to being an active board member of various charitable and religious organizations. And in his ample spare time he painted in and around the family home and the family estate, in and around The Hague and Scheveningen, and produced a series of delicate and charming, but also lively and characteristic portraits and scenes showing people at work and play (see Fig.86). Also, as a matter of course, he made sketches and water-colours during his travels all over Europe, including Russia, and in the United States. He painted the same kind of scenes and people depicted by so many masters of the Dutch School, but he painted them in the manner of his much-admired contemporaries, the Impressionists, with a great sense of free- dom and ease. He painted without any presumption, without any idea that others might take it seriously. A discovery indeed: Jan de Jonge, un petit maftre of great distinction . The Etruscan Treasures at the Rijks- museum van Oudheden, Leyden (due to close 2nd July) are at last on view; most of them either have been there since the museum's foundation in i818, or were acquired within the following decade. However, barring a few experts, nobody has ever yet seen more than the most important pieces spread over various departments. King William I founded this museum (and several others) and experts were sent to distant countries to buy suitable objects. One of these experts was Lt-Col. Jean- Emile Humbert (Fig.92) of the Corps of Engineers of the Netherlands Army, born at The Hague in I77i, the son of a popular portrait painter. Having bought satis- factory objects in Tunisia and especially in and around Carthage, he was sent to Italy in 1825 to buy Etruscan artefacts. Here he succeeded so well that he actually acquired the entire collection of the Museo Corazzi at Cortona. At first the King was 'rather displeased' because Humbert had spent the enormous sum of Dfl. 32,000 for this collection without H.M.'s special permission, but he was forgiven when the King heard what he had bought for what was then the equivalent of about 2,500 guineas. On the return from his third voyage, in 1830, it was found that Humbert had acquired over 3,000 valuable objects for the museum. The Etruscan collection, with subse- quent additions, could never be shown as an entity in a museum that seemed to grow more and more cramped in spite of two moves, each time to a larger building, and even in spite of a large extension which was added to the greatly enlarged and partially rebuilt Hof van Zessen, whose neo-classical facade was designed to match the mid-seventeenth-century houses in Rapenburg. All the museum's collections of Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Etruscan as well as Dutch archaeological treasures grew and grew. They grew into a scholar's hoard, an antiquarian's paradise. How- ever, the burgeoning interest in archaeology together with modern ideas on museum display led to many changes, and one department after another was transformed to enable it to show more of its treasures to a larger public.

N. van der Meer, who was allowed to get the Etruscan treasures out of the reserve cellars, to clean them and to have them restored wherever necessary and possible. He wrote a new. simple and lucid scenario to tell visitors who the Etruscans were, where and how they lived, how they died, and with all the museum's Etruscan wealth he created an Etruscan display of breathtaking beauty. Small numbers of selected specimens of the different types of ceramics made and used by the Etruscans highlight the successive cultural periods. We begin with the (really pre-Etruscan) dark, polished, biconical Villanova urns, discovered in deeply dug graves (tombe a pozzo) and pass to the far more sophisticated bucchero pottery. These vessels, which were thrown on the wheel, were found in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. They are a shiny black inside and out and are beautifully decorated with grafitto designs. These are followed by a fascinating Canopic jar (Fig.89), an anthropomorphic urn with handles which each carry the lower part of an arm with the hand, and with a lid in the shape of a man's head. Jars like these too were found in deeply dug graves, hut of a different type, tombe a ziro, and had been placed on a throne made of pottery or bronze and surrounded by a number of bucchero vessels (food was also placed in front of these urns on small bronze tables). There are also specimens of decorated vessels imported from Greece and copied in Etruria, as well as examples of the black glazed ware from Volterra. At least as attractive and interesting is the collection of bronzes (see Fig.87), from minute votive figures of men and animals to incense burners and torches. Finely decorated bronze helmets, mirrors and ewers lead up to the splendour of the golden jewels (see Fig.9o) which confirm the high level of Etruscan civilization. Most impressive of all is the collection of sepulchral urns (see Fig.88), oblong boxes with a lid bearing a more or less symbolic portrait of the deceased. These boxes, made of terra-cotta, alabaster or limestone, are decorated on the front, sometimes all round, with scenes from Greek mythology, carved in high relief. The quality of the carving of these scenes is often strikingly better than that of the grotesquely com- pressed figures on the lids. Even a recently acquired life-size figure of a woman on a sarcophagus lid lacks the vividness of the figures in the reliefs and of many of the bronzes. From I Ith January to Ioth February last, an exhibition of works by the Aus- tralian-born John Peter Russell (1858- 1931), who worked at Cormon's studio from i884 onwards, was shown at the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, Amsterdam. In Paris he met many artists, including Van Gogh, whose portrait (Fig.92) he painted in i886. ELKA SCHRIJVER</page><page sequence="4">90. Golden disk with filigrain and ruby.
