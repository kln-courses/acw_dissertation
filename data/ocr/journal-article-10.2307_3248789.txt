<plain_text><page sequence="1">C. SIVARAMAMURTI: THE WEAPONS OF VISHNU THE OBJECTS CARRIED BY Vishnu form a very important and interesting study. Their transformation in different ages and in different areas is an inter- esting story in itself. The form of the weapon and the position in which it occurs not only I a determines the form of the deity but also the age. } : There are four distinct forms by which the weapons of Vishnu can be distinguished when they are treated in anthropomorphic form as ayudhapurushas. The first variety is dwarfish answer- ing the description in Kalidasa's verse: P1. I. Gupta, Rijgir, dwarfish ayudhapurusha, chakra and gada guptam dadrisuratmanam sarvas svapneshu vdmanaih jalajasigadaJadrgachakrala chhitamirtibhih - (Raghu X, 60). Another variety shows the weapons personified in normal human form. They are usually shown against the aiyudhas, specially goad and chakra. At Rjgir (Plate I), at Mahbalipuram and at BaddmI we have instances of the dwarfish type of dyudhapurushas. There are also 128</page><page sequence="2">normal varieties frequently occurring in Gupta and early mediaeval sculpture as, for instance, in the panel from Udaya- giri cave in Central India. At Deogarh, in the Seshasayi panel, the ayudhapuru- shas are shown in normal pro- portions but not against Pi~. 11 their respective Gupta, Bayana, chakravikrama coin weapons in each case, although there is sufficient indication to help us to identify them. Where the personi- fied weapons are shown against the weapons themselves, we find Sudarsana as a youth against a wheel and Kaumodaki, the club of Vishnu, as a lady against the club. This re- presentation of Sudarsana against the wheel became such a favourite that in the chakra- vikrama coin of Chandragupta (Plate II) the king is shown deriving his sakti, composed of the three essential elements -prabhu, mzantra and utsaha as described in Kalidasa's line trisadhania aktirivdrthamakshayam (Raghu III, 13) .... from the chakrapurusha who is portrayed against a circular disc as offering three pellets to the sovereign. This chakrapurusha suggests the wheel of sovereignty, the imperial power P1. III Medieval, Uttar Pradesh, -the pariakrama of the chakravartin. The sankha and chakra purushas carrying conch and disc in hand importance of this power and the necessary Lucknow Museum 129</page><page sequence="3">force behind the enforcement of royal might gradually brought about a revolutionary change in the representation of the ayudhapurusha so far as the Chakrayudha is concerned. Almost in the spirit of the power of a thousand arms, as Kalidasa describes in the case of Kartaviryarjuna: sangramanirvishtasahasrabahuh (Raghu VI, 38); we find the figure on Sudarsanachakra with numerous arms and a fierce mein holding every possible weapon. Of this mediaeval concept an excellent example of the early Vijayanagar period may be seen in the grand monolithic carving from near the large tank in lower Ti- rupati. Not satisfied with this awe-inspiring figure on the obverse the figure of Narasimha on a trikona is added in the centre on the reverse of the chakra. The flames developed for both the sanikha and chakra in the mediaeval period in Chola and Chalukyan sculptures are more significant in the case of the Sudarsanachakra rather than in the case of any other. A second variety of ayudhaphurusha shows the weapon on the head of the personified iyudha. One of the earliest representations of this type comes from Deogarh, where Sudar- sanachakra is suggestively represented with the wheel in the prayoga attitude right on the head of the figure. This tradition is very interesting as amongst two unique Chola bronzes, acquired by the Madras Museum some years ago, one represents Sudarsana standing as a youth with folded arms and with the wheel on his head; the other one is a similar re- presentation of gada. A third tradition, in the case of the anthropomorphic representation of ayudhas of Vishnu, is to show them actually carrying the weapon in his or her hand. Thus Panchajanya or Sankhapurusha is a youth carrying the conch in his hand, and Sudarsana or Chakrapurusha a similar figure with the wheel in his hand. Kaumodaki is represented as a lady supporting the gadd or club. These figures of ayudhapurushas carrying the weapon in their hand are most frequent in sculptures in Uttar Pradesh, and there are several fine examples from the Luck- now Museum (Plate III) and Mathura (Plate IV). In these cases Sarngadhanus or the bow appears as a youth with a bow in his hand in the same manner as Nandaka or the sword of Vishnu as he is present amongst the dyudhapurushas in the Seshasayi panel from Deogarh. In Bengal this type of a-yudhapurusha also occurs, but as in the case of Vishnu himself, who sometimes carries his weapons on a lotus as is the mode in some of the Buddhist sculptures as, for instance, in the exquisite bronze representing Hrishikesa in the collection of the 130</page><page sequence="4">uwnasnwS v.nc/vlp pueq UT osip pur qipuoo SuiX:azo suqsnJnd aujBlpo pur eqj.UeS SuTxoqs sapBjd ~e'n '_Anyw 'B I^ apapw AI 'Id</page><page sequence="5">P1.

VIII Medieval, Bengal Showing anfkha and chakra purushas with conch and discuss on head Indian Museum, Calcutta In late mediaeval sculpture the ayudhas are represented as weapons pure and simple, but these again differ in shape from the earlier ones. The earliest conch and wheel carried by Vishnu of the Kushan period is a plain conch and a plain disc without any kind of addition whatsoever (Plate IX). In the Gupta period they continue almost unchanged, although in early mediaeval sculpture a central tassel appears from the hub of the wheel (Plate X). In I34</page><page sequence="8">later Pala sculpture this tassel curves and daprts up like a tongue of flame and the conch, which is held in normal faP.shaionn, Math across the palm, is held with its spiral top downwards and mouth upwards. In early Chfeukyan and Pallava sculpture n U P t the wheel is held on edge in the prayog a fashion, but later it is held oblique andpy finally, in late Chola and Vijayanagar sculpture, the weapon occurs flat giving a full view of the disc together with its tassels that have in the meantime de- veloped on both sides; which, however, are quite diminutive compared to the tail-like ones in contemporary CMhukyan figures. The gada which is very huge and long, and of the same height as the principal figure itself, is pillar-like in its structure in the Kushan period (Plate IX), and appears like a long pestle or musala, gradually changes. In late mediaeval sculpture it is held up in the upper arm P1. IX Kushan, Mathurd where it appears reduced in size like a Vishnu holding plain ayudhas Note long gada pestle-like large-sized flute, and it has a heavy de- corated pattern added to the top as a plume. This becomes an invariable feature in all Pala sculpture. In Uttar Pradesh the gadad tapers towards the handle and bulges towards the other end. The cushion-shaped bulbous part of the gadd is also fluted. In the Chd!ukyan area the club is generally thick and barrel- like. Further south in the Pallava area the thick gda which is not particularly bulbous towards any one end, gradually changes in the Chola period and becomes thinner still. 135</page><page sequence="9">P1. X Late Kushan or early Gupta, Mathura Note form of ayudha plain and personified But it is divided into several segments with bands at inter- vals and is often fluted. In Chalukyan sculpture the tas- sels, sometimes long and tail- like, distinguish the weapons, like the wheel and the conch, and are specially characteristic of sculpture from this area. It may be thus noted that the form of the Sudarsanachakra and sankha as pure weapons in the earliest sculpture is again found in late mediaeval sculp- ture but in a transformed shape, the shape itself differing in different regions in different periods. The personified re- presentation of weapons simi- larly appears in at least four different modes in different areas following a tradition which was a great favourite in the Gupta period. I am thankful to the Department of Archaeology in India and the Lucknow Museum for the photographs illustrating this paper. 136</page></plain_text>
