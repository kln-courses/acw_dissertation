<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM SCIENCE AND HYPOTHESIS TO LAST THOUGHTS OF H. POINCARt (1854-1912) * BY ANDRE LALANDE It was at the close of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century that Henri Poincare wrote the articles brought together in the series of his works Science and Hypothesis (Paris, 1902), The Value of Science (Paris, 1905), Science and Method (Paris, 1909), Last Thoughts (Paris, 1913). Of these four volumes 1 the first is the most negative. Its leading idea may be summarized in two theses: first, that science cannot know any absolute truth concerning nature since all it can establish with certainty is the relation of certain principles to certain consequences, or of a hypothesis to what it implies; secondly, that a great many results claimed by science have nothing necessary about them and result from "conventions " adopted by scientists not without reason and yet by free choice, for among many possible conventions they have selected those that were " convenient " (commodes), although others could be substituted with- out any contradiction. Classical geometry is not more true than non- euclidean geometries; the only advantage of the former is that of being simpler. Is it a fact that the Earth turns around the Sun? It is really a hypothesis accepted by the astronomer and handed down to common sense where it is crystallized into a fact. By accepting it, despite appearances contrary to our senses, we have a more aesthetic picture of the world and our calculations are facilitated. But nothing would strictly prevent our leaving the Earth stationary; only that would produce a complication too cumbersome for a complete cosmography. The expressions " convention " and " convenience " (commodite) caused consternation, but Poincare was not vexed by it. However, these terms were exploited by the enemies of science who were delighted to see its authority weakened; but Poincare refused to admit that. In the aftermath of his publications, during a very lively session of the Societe de philo- sophie, he reacted vigorously against those who wished to convert his critical reservations into a weapon against the value of experiment and reasoning; whence the title of his second volume, The Value of Science. Paradoxical though some of his formulations might appear, they still adhered to a broad stream of thought which can be traced back to the * Translated by Philip P.

Poincare was not ignorant of the philosophy of his time. He was acquainted with the doctoral thesis of his brother-in-law Emile Boutroux (1845-1921) on La Contingence des Lois de la Nature (Paris, 1874) [The Contingency of the Laws of Nature]. He had probably read the articles in which Charles S. Peirce founded 'pragmatism,' la developed so brilliantly (but not without distortion) under the later influence of William James. Poincare freely quoted Ernst Mach and his ingenious theory of the " economy of thought." It was also the time when Gaston Milhaud (1858-1918) was writing his Essai sur les conditions et les limites de la certitude logique (Paris, 1898, 2d. edition) [Essay on the Conditions and Limits of Logical Certainty] and Pierre Duhem (1861-1916) was writing his Theorie physique: son objet, sa structure (Paris, 1905).2 When we reinsert Poincare's bold philosophical utterances into this intellectual atmosphere, they are far from appearing excessive. Moreover, they were subordinated in his thought to a solid faith in truth and reason. If it is necessary and important to make room in our know- ledge of nature and even in geometry for the will, convention, and in- tellectual convenience, that does not take anything away from science's moral value or power. " The search for truth," he writes "should be the aim of our activity; it is its only worthy goal .... And when I speak of truth, undoubtedly I mean first of all scientific truth, but I also mean moral truth, what is called justice being one of its aspects. It is for the very same reasons that we are led to love and doubt them." Many pages of Dernieres Pensees [Last Thoughts] might be found which develop this aspect of his philosophy. When we recall his philosophy today, we must accordingly be wary of reducing it to a few formulas which have become famous for their novelty. Neither scientists nor philosophers speak any longer in terms of "con- venience " or " convention," although M. Dupreel in a very well balanced and precise article3 has shown the full import of this term. But the character of science which Poincare wished to express has not disappeared, and has perhaps even become the acquisition of thinking men. In the first place, what Poincare felt strongly is that man's science is not a more and more exact copy of a body of laws already made and inscribed beforehand in the structure of things around us or in the anthropomorphic la The French translation of Peirce's two articles on " The Fixation of Belief " and "How To Make Our Ideas Clear" (Pop. Sci. Monthly, 1877-78) appeared in the Revue Philosophique (Dec. 1878 and Jan. 1879) without the word ' pragmatism' occurring in either the original or French versions. Peirce himself objected to Poin- care's nominalist, pragmatist, and finitist philosophy of science, and sided with Cantor against Poincare's attack on Cantorian realistic views of infinity.-P. P.

The world which science causes us to become acquainted with is but the most recent stage of the constructions raised in common by scientists and philosophers on the basis of our sense impressions and in accordance with the guidance of our reason. In the second place, he brought out vividly the fundamental procedure in all the sciences of reasoning, experimental or otherwise; this procedure, he showed, consists of setting up a definitive " axiomatic " system, as we now say, from which consequences follow whose value is then judged retroactively by their agreement with what exists independently of us. Nobody has done more than he in France to bring home to educated men the idea that Euclid's system of axioms is not endowed with metaphysical truth, and that on this point it does not differ in any way from Riemann's or Lobatchevski's axiomatic systems. In that respect he was one of the precursors of what M. Bachelard has ingeniously called "the philosophy of No [La philosophie du Non, Paris, 1940]," of the critical method which systematically explores the regions to which we would be led by the hypothetical negation of such and such a principle accepted traditionally. Poincare has often been reproached for having believed that classical geometry would always remain the most " convenient," and that it would be preferable, should an adverse case arise, to admit actions by new physical forces rather than change the geometry. But that proves only that, as Meyerson used to say, " we do not put reason to task right away on the first trial." And so Poincare's error in his prognosis even confirms his main thesis: for it is precisely because it was found more convenient to use a space of constant or variable curvature that non-Euclidean space was preferred. And if we were to object that the chief reason for abandoning the simplest axiom-system, i.e., Euclid's, despite its analytical advantages and despite common-sense habits, is primarily the assimilation or identification thus obtained among domains originally very distinct, there again a norma- tive idea even if not in the foreground of Poincare's thought, nevertheless appears to have been present in his thought: the supreme value of identity. With respect to the assimilation of things among themselves, he offered the remark that the great aim of science was to discover invariants, and if the evolution of creatures were admitted, we could not suppose an evolution of laws without rendering all knowledge impossible. But it is above all with respect to the assimilation of minds to one another that he recognized the sovereignty of identity: "Whether we adopt the viewpoint of ethics, aesthetics, or science, it is always the same thing: nothing is objective except what is identical for all."
