<plain_text><page sequence="1">Semeiological analysis of the traditional African settlement A.-Ph. Lagopoulos Introduction The object of this study is to present a preliminary in- vestigation of the traditional African settlement as a semeiological system. For the benefit of readers not acquainted with the current terminology of structural linguistics - the basis of semeiology - a brief glos- sary is here given of the main terms used in this paper.1 Social language (langue) [speech (parole): The so- cial part of a language consists of a system of con- ventional signs. Speech is the individual part which consists of personal combinations of signs, within the rules of the social language. Extended speech is called discourse (discours). Signifier (signifiant) /signified (signifié): These two together form the linguistic sign. The signifier is a meaningful element (such as a word). The signified is the concept that is correlated with it. Both the sig- nifier and the signified consist of a form and a sub- stance. Pre-signifier: The semeiological sign frequently dif- fers from the linguistic sign in that it has material sub- stance (such as a road or a landmark). Here we have the pre-signifier which, in a semeiological system, can be a useful object (function-sign according to R. Barthes). Syntagm / paradigm: The syntagm is a combination of signs governed by syntactic rules. The paradigm is a set of linguistic signs that are related by sound and/ or meaning. Denotative / connotative: In a system of denotation, the signs used are limited to this system. In a system of connotation, its signifiers are signs of another sys- tem. Certain signs of denotation can be transferred into signifiers of connotation. The form of a set of signifiers of connotation is called rhetoric ; the form of a set of signified of connotation is called ideology. Semeiology and town planning A town planning sign (such as a landmark) is a func- tion sign that is born by a pre-signifier. This pre-signi - fier can lead to one or more signified of denotation and - alone or with other pre-signifiers - to a series of signified of connotation. The symbolism of the set- tlement will be found at this level. Semeiology of the traditional African settlement For the purposes of this study, Africa has been divided into a number of cultural areas on the basis of ethno- logical criteria (Fig. 1). This division relies mainly on the views of M.J. Herskovits as criticized by M.M. Ho- rowitz2 and D. Paulme; the area of Egypt has been de- fined on archaeological criteria. Area I: egypt The determinative of the hieroglyph "nywt" (city) has two forms, which are traceable at least as far back as the beginning of the dynastic period. Both are cir- cular. One of them contains a cross-road, the other a gridiron road system. The main feature of the Egyptian necropolis is the pyramid, identified with the primordial hill of Egyptian mythology and with the world. The pyramid of Cheops is surrounded by mastaba tombs. Those on the east Dr. Lagopoulos is Senior Lecturer in Town Planning at the Athens Technical University. He holds doctorates in engi- neering from Athens and in Ethnology from Paris University. 142 Ekistics Í95, Feb. 7972 COMMUNITY SCAUE I U Hi I II Ml IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII 1 2 3 4 S * 7 8 » « 11 12 13 14 IS ^ j i I Lii._î i i i I I I Lili NATURE ^ i """ » * ' I SOCIETY • Uj SHELLS " NETWORKS SYNTHESIS</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 : Cultural areas of Africa (A.-Ph. Lagopoulos, 1970) Fig. 2: The Kahun worker's settlement (P. Lavedan, J. Hu- gueney, 1966) belong to close relations of the king; those on the west to other dignitaries. The settlement of Kahun (XII Dynasty) was square and oriented to the points of the compass. It was di- vided into an eastern section containing the dwelling of the well-to-do, and a western section containing the workers' dwellings (Fig. 2). A study of the structural properties of ancient Egyp- tian space (from the temple to the entire country) im- plies that its organization, function and form rest on simple semantic "pairs of opposition." These oppos- ing pairs are counterbalanced around two axes - real or theoretical - which intersect at right angles. The point of intersection is identified with the center of the world.3 Area III: the sahara Libya: The numbers 3 and 4, which symbolize the world, are the basis of the organization of the oases of Fezzan. A tripartite oasis corresponds to a "head" and a quadripartite one to a "belly." The Albarkat oasis corresponds to a belly and is therefore quadri- partite. Its center is considered as the head of the oasis, and is rectangular, oriented N, S, E and W. It is surrounded by 4 sectors, considered as the limbs, and the whole constitutes a square, walled enclosure. Tripartite oases consist of two sectors separated by a road running N-S or E-W and a fort. One level of the signified of connotation of the oases of Fezzan re- presents cosmic notions, another anthropomorphic notions. Tunisia: According to tradition, the settlement of To- zeur stands on the site of an ancient settlement which consisted of two sectors: the eastern one correspond- ing to the upper world, and the western one to the lower world. Today, Tozeur has 7 sectors: three cen- tral ones (the head) and four outer ones (the limbs) oriented to the points of the compass (Fig. 3). As with the oases of Fezzan, each sector can be converted into a pre-signifier leading to a signified of connotation which is cosmic. Algeria: The Aulef el Arab oasis of Tidikelt is bisected by a road running E-W. It has 5 sectors to north, 4 corresponding to a man and one to his genital organ, and 6 sectors to the south, corresponding to 3 women. Fig. 3: Tozeur (V. Pâques, 1964) Ekistics 195, Feb. 1972 143</page><page sequence="3">On another level of connotation we have 4 male and 3 twin female sectors, the sum of which is the symbol of the world. North Mali: Tombuctu is a representation of the pri- mordial star from which the world was created (4). It consists of a central sector and 4 outer sectors. These are arranged theoretically as the four arms of a cross oriented to the points of the compass, and correspond to the limbs of the human body (Fig. 4). Area A: sudan Dogon (South Mali): Traditionally, the Dogon settle- ment should be a square oriented to the points of the compass and divided by a grid-iron road system. The whole settlement and each sector correspond both to the world and to the human body. The settlements are frequently bipartite, symbolizing the duality of the pri- mordial element from which the world originated.5 The Mande of North Togo: The Horo nobles founded the Mande settlement by marking out a circular or rec- tangular space which was surrounded by an enclosure with four gates, N, S, E and W. The signified of con- notation of this settlement was the orbit of the sun, and also the world.6 Yoruba (South Nigeria): T radition says that the sacred settlement of Ife, the model on which Yoruba settle- ments are patterned, originally consisted of 4 sectors oriented to the points of the compass, with - between them - 12 other similar sectors. All were arrayed around a central sector standing on a hill and con- sisting of the palace of the religious chief. Even to- day, Ife is composed of 1 7 sectors (Fig, 5a). According to the Yoruba, the form of the world is circular or rec- tangular. It is regarded as bipartite and also quadri- partite, because of the two road axes (oriented N-S and E-W) which intersect at the world center (Fig. 5b). The world is also regarded as consisting of 16 parts.7 Fali (North Cameroon): The extended family of the Fali of Kangu is organized as bipartite and quadipar- tite. Their dwellings are laid out spirally on the ground, focussing on the patriarch who is regarded as standing at the center of the world. The settlement is com- posed of two social groups; certain extended families being organized in the form of right-hand spirals, the others in left-hand spirals. At a cosmic level, the sig- nified of connotation of the extended family and of the settlement are related to the earth and the world; at an anthropomorphic level, to a man.8 Kotoko (South Chad): Logone-Birni, the model Kotoko settlement, consists of two areas divided by the palace zone, which is regarded as the center of the world (Fig. 6). The palace enclosure includes the tukuri building which is divided into two sections, the north- ern part male,, the southern part female. The road that divides them is considered as the axis of equilibrium Fig. 4: Tombuctu (V. Pâques, 1964) Fig. 5 a) Ite (A.L. Mabogunje, 1962) b) Image of the world of the Yoruba 144 Ekistics 195, Feb. 1972</page><page sequence="4">of both the palace and the settlement. It is also re- garded as the axis of the world. According to the Kokoto, the world consists of a northern male region and a female southern region, separated by a river, on the bank of which grows the cosmic axis-tree. The pálace road and the two areas of Logone-Birni are 3 pre-signifiers, whose signified of connotation are the axis of the world and its northern and southern re- gions.9 Area B: east africa Nilotes: The pastoral Masai tribe is divided into two halves, one corresponding to the color black, the other to the color red. Black denotes the benevolent aspect of the supreme being, Ngai, and red his malevolent aspect.10 The settlement, or kraal, of the Masai shep- herds is circular. Every head of its polygamous fam- ilies has his own private entrance into the kraal, and his wives build separate huts right and left of this entrance in order of seniority. The set of these huts probably relates to a series of sets of signified of con- notation, such as black/ red; good/bad; upper world/ lower world. East Bantu: The Ngulu believe that there is a corres- pondence between the two pairs: community/wild country and order /disorder.11 Thus the "signified of connotation" of their settlements is (cosmic) order. Area V: central africa Valley of the Congo: In this valley, there are linear settlements with rows of rectangular buildings on one or both sides of a straight road. H.M. Stanley refers to pairs of buildings that sometimes exceed 300 m. in length and lie on either side of a straight road. He adds that in East Indenduru these buildings have only one entrance, at their east end.12 The available data have not enabled us to establish the "signified of con- notation" of these settlements, but the road probably represents the E-W axis of the world. Ba-Luba and Ba-Lulua (South Congo): According to tradition, the world is composed of four superimposed levels, each organized as the image of the whole world around a cross oriented to the points of the com- pass. Their settlements were formerly divided by two Fig. 6: Logone-Birni (W. Müller, 1961) roads intersecting at right angles. The world, viewed from a dynamic aspect, is symbolized by concentric circles and the spirally coiled python, whose two colors represent the principles of good (white) and evil (red or black).13 Lele (South Congo): Some of their settlements are rectangular and divided diagonally into two triangles. One triangle houses the oldest men and the first gen- eration of young men, and has one hand of the human body as Wssigmfied of connotation. The other contains the second generation of older men and the very young men, and its signified of connotation is the other hand.14 The opposition of right hand/left hand cor- responds to the opposition of humanity/animality. This seems to relate to the opposition of world/chaos. Kingdom of Congo: The king's palace, in the capital, Mbanza Kongo, was organized in two areas: a male area for the king and a female one for the queen. The size of other dwellings and their distance from the center was in direct relation to the social rank of their owners. The signified of connotation of the palace was the world.15 The form of the enclosure of the settlements of the Lunda, Congo and Chokwe of Angola is circular, spiral, or like an open U. Their main axis, which symbolizes the axis of the world, usually runs E-W, and the main entrance is to the east. The "signified of connotation" of these settlements are the serpent, the rainbow and the world. The world, in their view, is circular, with two axes: the principal one E-W and the secondary one N-S. If predominance is given to the concept of the serpent, we find spiral enclosures; if predominance is given to the world, the enclosures are circular. Area VII: south africa Herero (Central Southwest Africa): The pattern of the traditional Herero settlement or Kraal is circular, di- vided into two halves; a male area to the south and a female area to the north. The signified of connota- tion of the southern half is both the upper world and the colqr black; and in the northern half it is both the lower world and the color red. Cattle are kept in a sacred enclosure in the center of the kraal. On the theoretical axis of the settlement and to the east, is the chiefs hut ("e" Fig. 7). Between this and the cattle enclosure ("b" Fig. 7) is an element of vegetation ("c" Fig. 7) and an altar on which the sacred flame burns. The signified of connotation of these are the mythi- cal tree of the underworld "omumborombonga," and the sun and the supreme deity, Ndjambi Karunga.16 Ngoni, Zulu , Xhosa , Swazi of Lake Nyasa ; The pattern of the Zulu settlement is circular with a cattle enclosure at its center. The main entrance is to the east, and the main hut faces towards it. There are three entrances, all passing also into the cattle enclosure (Fig. 8). The settlement is constructed on sloping ground, so that Ekistics 195 , Feb . 1972 145</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 7: Herero settlement: a) entrance, b) cattle kraal, c) veg- etable element, d) altar, e) sacred hut (H.G. Luttig) the main hut is at the highest point and the main en- trance at the lowest level. The huts to the right of the main entrance belong to the indlunkulu sector, those of the left to the ikohlwa. The Zulu settlement has two general semeiological structures, one dualistic, the other triadic. The signified of connotation of both the individual huts and the settlement is the world.17 Areas VI, pigmies; VIII, damara; IX, HOTTENTOT; X, BUSHMEN The Pigmy settlements are usually circular. The settle- ments of the Mbuti Pigmies have no definite boundary but the hut entrances tend to face towards the center.18 This seems to indicate that the signifiers of denota- tion of the settlement correspond to the dualistic pair: center/periphery. The settlement of the Damara resembles that of the Herero. Its few huts are placed in a circle around a central public space with a sacred tree at its center. East of this tree is the sacred fire, and further east is the hut of the chiefs principal wife. All hut entrances face towards the sacred fire, which symbolizes the sun. According to a drawing by P. Kolbe (1627), all en- trances to the huts of a Hottentot settlement faced to- ward the central hut. The center of the typical Heikum Bushmen settle- ment is an open space containing a tree and a sacred flame. The huts of the headman and his brothers are grouped on one side and those of the other inhabitants opposite to them, on the other side. Entrances to the huts of the Kung Bushmen settlements also tend to face toward its center. The hut in which the unmarried men sleep and the initiation place for the boys are both located to the east of the settlement, establishing an E-W axis (Fig. 9). The available data indicates that the signified of connotation of both the Hottentot and the Bushmen settlements is the world. 19 Conclusions This study of the traditional African settlement, which presents a new approach to town planning, based on Fig. 8: Zulu settlement (E.J. Krige, 1936) the structural methods of social anthropology, leads to the following conclusions. 1 . The analysis of the traditional African settlements demonstrates the preponderance of the signified of connotation of a cosmic and anthropomorphic nature; and the organization of the signs of denotation and their pre-signifiers according to the signified of con- notation. Hence, the typology of the traditional Afri- can settlements rests on a knowledge of mythology. Despite the over-riding importance of the signified of connotation (which undergoes modification exceed- ingly slowly in all non-western cultures) we cannot deny the roles played by ecological and historical fac- tors in the shaping of African settlements. This brings us face to face with the conflict between "system" and "history," envisaged by F. de Saussure and C. Lévi- Strauss.20 2. It is interesting that the signifiers of denotation of traditional African settlements can be classified into the same 5 categories of a paradigmatic nature that were established by Kevin Lynch in his analysis of three North American cities: 2 points - the node and the landmark; 2 lines - the path and the edge; 1 sur- face - the district.21 3. The form of the signified of connotation of the general spatial scale of African settlements (which constitute a syntagm) can be expressed mathemati- cally (Fig. 10). General syntactic laws are expressed in the dualistic pair +/ - and the triad +/o/ - . These forms denote bi-polar semantic elements or "stressed (marqué)/zero degree.' 4. The simultaneous and/or successive existence in a single settlement of a number of sets of signified of connotation having a static structure shows that these sets become transformed. In this process of transformation, the new set generally remains within the bounds determined by the previous structure: it is "autoregulated." Thus the signified of connotation of the general spa- tial scale of the Bantu settlement have undergone a diachronic transformation. In our view, the older form of the Bantu settlement is characterized by a dualistic concentric structure and a circular perimeter, and 146 Ekistics Î9S, Feb. 1972</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 9: Werf of Kung Bushmen (D. Fraser, 1968) Fig. 10: Form of the signified of connotation of the African settlement (A.-Ph. Lagopoulos, 1970) appears to relate to a pre-agricultural economy and an ideology of the center of the world not related to the points of the compass. The next form combines the former structure and perimeter with a dualistic acial structure, and appears to relate to a quasi-agri- cultural economy and an ideology of the center of the world which starts to incorporate some cardinal direc- tions. The most recent form, which we believe is most probably due to Rhodesian culture impelled by Su- danese culture, is characterized by two dualistic axial structures and two roads intersecting at right angles, within a square or rectangular boundary. This ap- pears to relate to an agricultural economy and an ideology of the center of the world and the four car- dinal directions, N, S, E and W. 5. The elements of the set of the signified of con- notation of the African settlement satisfy the mathe- matical definition of the structure as well as the three main properties of an authentic structure as defined by J. Piaget: totality, transformation, autoregulation. They are therefore organized into authentic "model- structures," to use the term employed by J. Parain- Vial.22 6. With the exception of certain linear settlements, all African settlements are organized around a central feature: either concentrically (south of the equator) or Ekistics 195, Feb. 1972 147</page><page sequence="7">quadrilaterally (north of the equator). The central feature may be a tree, an open space, a cattle en- closure, a hut, a crossroads, a hill, an altar, a mosque, a mausoleum, a market place, a palace, a sector, a fort - ora combination of these. The signified of con- notation of this central feature is the center of the world. It is the most important point of the settlement, and the quaMty of the space around it diminishes in accordance with its distance from the center. Thus, if a grade R corresponds to the social rank of an African, such that Rn &gt; Rn + i; if S.n denotes the distance of his dwelling from the center of the settle- ment, and if tn is a variable such that: fn X &lt; tn + i X - L- , Kn Rn+1 then the relations between Rn and Sn can be establish- ed by the formula: sn = tn X nn 7. Our analysis also permits us to formulate the fol- lowing series of semeiological properties of the Afri- can settlement. a. Every set of signs of denotation and of signified of connotation has a social derivation. b. The signs of denotation are as many or more than the signifiers of connotation. c. It is possible to have superimposed or successive sets of signifiers of denotation and of signified of connotation, each set being related to a specific spatial scale. 8. The traditional African settlement is governed by a code similar to a social language. Each phrase of its speech consists of a number of signs that are look- ed upon by each individual as constituting a set. The sign of each larger spatial scale comprises phrases of the smaller, more analytical, spatial scales. The entire African settlement is, therefore, a discourse. Discourse calls for rhetoric, and this rhetoric refers to the ideology of the social group that created it. References 1. F. de Saussure, Cours de linguistique générale, Payot, Paris, 1971; R.
