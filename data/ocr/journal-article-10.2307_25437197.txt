<plain_text><page sequence="1">In brief When put to unscrupulous uses those old-fashioned virtues of unquestioning obedience and loyalty swiftly become vices. This was the case with the prison-camp guards and their dogs in Stalin's time in Russia?or any time or place, for that matter. To show some of the brutality in the camps caused by such conditioning Georgi Vladimir has chosen to look through the eyes of a Caucasian sheepdog, and his anthropomorphic treatment is curiously effective because one's sympathies are with Faithful Ruslan (Jonathan Cape, ?4-95) but not with his master. Is this because we are naturally more sympathetic to dogs than men, because we expect less of dogs, or because Ruslan is more loyal than his master ? When the prison camps are disbanded the dogs are left to fend for themselves. Bewildered and distrustful of everyone, they congregate daily at the station waiting for the prisoners to return. At last a column of workers turns up ; the dogs assume that they are prisoners, herd them accordingly (they are trained to herd men instead of sheep), and pandemonium breaks loose. This clever indictment of an abhorrent system is unpublished in Russia because of its political implications, and British readers are lucky to have a chance to read Michael Glenny's excellent translation of a chilling story.
