<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANALYSIS OF THE CONTEXT AND CONTENTS OF AN ULUA-STYLE MARBLE VASE FROM THE PALMAREJO VALLEY, HONDURAS E. Christian Wells, Karla L. Davis-Salazar, José E. Moreno-Cortés, Glenn S. L. Stuart, and Anna C. Novotný Ulúa-style marble vases played important social, political, economic, and religious roles in southern Mesoamerica during the seventh through eleventh centuries A.D. However, most such vessels known to archaeologists are part of looted collec- tions or else were unearthed before the advent of modern archaeological practices. As a result, little is known about the context, use, and chronology of these objects. Recent investigations at the site of Palos Blancos in northwest Honduras dis- covered an Ulúa-style marble vase in an undisturbed mortuary context. Excavation of the burial context, along with bioar- chaeological and stable isotope analysis of the human remains, suggests that the vase was placed as an offering, possibly to an ancestor of the residential group. Phosphate and pollen studies indicate that the vase once held a corn-based bever- age. Radiocarbon dating of four charcoal samples from immediately below and adjacent to the vase yielded a range of dates from the beginning of the Late Classic period, ca. AD. 600-800. Through analyses of the context and contents of the vase, this research contributes to a more holistic understanding of the use and meaning of Ulúa-style marble vases in southern Mesoamerica. Los vasos de mármol del estilo Ulúa desempeñaron importantes papeles sociales, políticos, económicos, y religiosos en el sur de Mesoamérica durante los siglos séptimo a onceavo d.C. Sin embargo, la mayoría de dichas vasijas conocidas por los arque- ólogos forman parte de colecciones saqueadas o fueron desenterradas antes de la disponibilidad de prácticas arqueológicas modernas. Como resultado, se sabe muy poco sobre su contexto, uso, y cronología. Excavaciones recientes en el sitio Palos Blancos en el Valle de Palmarejo en el noroeste de Honduras descubrieron un vaso de mármol del estilo Ulúa en un contexto mortuorio intacto. Este trabajo reporta los resultados de los análisis del depósito y de los contenidos del vaso, así como la datación de materias orgánicas asociadas con el hallazgo. El contexto del entierro así como los análisis bioarqueológicos y de isótopos estables de los restos humanos sugieren que el vaso fue colocado como una ofrenda hecha tal vez a un ancestro del grupo residencial. Los estudios de fosfatos y del polen indican que el vaso alguna vez contuvo una bebida de maíz . La datación por radiocarbono de cuatro muestras de carbón tomadas inmediatamente debajo y adyacentes al vaso proveyó una serie de fechas (cal. 2&lt;j 595 ±55, 615 ±45, 625 ±45, 705 ±65 d.C.) que corresponden principalmente al principio del perí- odo Clásico Tardío, ca. 600-800 d.C. Un espécimen en directa asociación con los restos humanos brindó una fecha de cal. 2&lt;j 495 ± 85 d.C., sugiriendo que el vaso no fue añadido al conjunto funerario hasta un siglo después del entierro inicial. A través de los análisis del contexto y del contenido del vaso, esta investigación contribuye a una comprensión más completa del uso y significado de los vasos de mármol del estilo Ulúa en el sur de Mesoamérica. In raw a major prehispanic materials source times, as of well cacao northwest as finished and other Honduras products significant was for a major source of cacao and other significant raw materials as well as finished products for many lowland Maya cities, whose social and re- ligious commitments required great quantities of these products to fuel their luxury economies (Foias and Emery 2012; Henderson 1992; Hen- don 1991; LeCount 2001; Luke 2010; McAnany 2010; Masson and Freidel 2002; Schortman and Urban 2011). However, archaeological work has demonstrated that northwest Honduras was not an economically underdeveloped, politically ho- mogenous periphery from which such strategic goods could be extracted without recompense E.

Lowland Maya potentates had to forge political alliances and economic con- tracts with their Honduran peers, which fostered the development of a cultural landscape com- posed of competing markets for Honduran prod- ucts (Joyce 1991; Schortman and Urban 1994; Sheptak 1987), including competition within and among Honduran polities for the same goods (Joyce and Henderson 2007; Lopiparo 2003; Schortman and Urban 2012). Among the products that appear to have been in high demand were elaborate and intricately carved vessels made of white marble and crafted by skilled artisans in the Ulua Valley during the first millennium A.D. (Gordon 1920, 1921; Luke 2002, 2012; Stone 1938). These containers, rep- resenting both cylinders and drums, were deco- rated with sculpted scrolls or volutes that wrap around the exterior and frame zoomorphic or anthropomorphic figures emerging from oppo- site sides of the vase to form lugs or handles (for examples, see Luke 2008). The entire scene is often framed by a border of repeating geometric designs, including scales, voussures (repeating half-moon shapes), interlocking keys, and circles with a central dot. Vases thought to be earlier in date have simple design schemes with bird, bat, or monkey handles, while varieties thought to be later in date have more complex design pro- grams and feline or composite feline/serpent handles (Luke 2002:62-64). Many, but not all, vases have ring or tripod supports, which are also variably decorated with incised patterns (Luke 2002:62). The containers were used in a variety of con- texts, including dedicatory caches and mortuary programs, and were distributed widely across southeastern Mesoamerica, lower Central America, and into the central Maya lowlands. Ulua-style marble vases and vase fragments have been re- covered from royal tombs in the Maya lowlands at Altun Ha, Uaxactun, San José, and Chac Balam on Ambergris Caye, as well as from various locales in the Guanacaste region of Costa Rica, including Ortega, Nacascolo, Vidor, and Iguanita (see Luke 2008, 2010 for a review of the evidence). In Hon- duras, marble vases have been found in high con- centrations in the Ulua Valley (specifically, at Trav- esía and neighboring hamlets- Santa Ana, La Mora, and Peor es Nada) and in cached deposits and tombs at Copán, El Abra, Salitron Viejo, Tenampua, Yarumela, and Orica. Through stable isotope analysis, Luke and col- leagues (2006; Luke and Tykot 2007) have demonstrated that most vessels originated from quarries near the community of Travesía. Indi- viduals outside of this region likely acquired vases through gifting and long distance exchange (Luke 2012:122). Following Joyce (1986:324, 1991, 1993), Luke (2012) argues that vase style played an important role in marking identity, that most of the vessels probably represented the community of Travesía as symbols of place, and that some vessels may have been manufactured specifically for patrons in distant settlements. Despite the important social, political, eco- nomic, and religious roles that Ulua-style marble vases appear to have played in Mesoamerican prehistory, we know surprisingly little about their contexts of use, because most examples come from looted collections (Luke 2006; Luke and Henderson 2006) or were excavated before the advent of modern archaeological techniques (Hendersonl992: 164-166). Less than half of the 166 vases known to reside in museums and repos- itories have secure proveniences (Luke et al. 2006:19). Since the vast majority of vases have not been excavated scientifically, very little is known about how these vessels were used in an- cient southeastern Mesoamerican societies. More- over, while marble fragments and a few whole vases have been found in association with poly- chrome pottery diagnostic of the Late Classic pe- riod, ca. A.D. 600-800, the precise dating of these objects remains unclear. Recently, during our excavations in the Pal- marejo Valley of northwest Honduras, we dis- covered an Ulua-style marble vase associated with a mortuary assemblage containing two hu- man burials underneath a residential building (Davis-Salazar, Wells, and Moreno-Cortés 2007). In this article, we report the details and context of the vase and burials, along with the results of analyses of sediment, pollen, and charcoal asso- ciated with these deposits.1 We also discuss the vase's significance to Honduran and Mesoamer- ican archaeology.</page><page sequence="3">84 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 25, No. 1, 2014] Figure 1. Northwest Honduras, showing the Palmarejo Valley and major Classic period settlements. Cultural and Historical Context The Palmarejo Valley is situated between the Ulua and Chamelecon rivers in northwest Hon- duras (Figure 1). The valley is a side pocket of the larger and archaeologically better known Naco Valley, which encompasses 92 km2 of alluvial bottomlands watered by the Chamelecon River as it carves its way through the southern boundary of the Sierra de Omoa. The earliest inhabitants of the Naco Valley, who were probably ancestral to the modern-day Lenca of central Honduras, first set- tled the region by 1200 B.C. (Urban et al. 2002). By about A.D. 600, the valley hosted a population in the low tens of thousands organized into a hi- erarchy of settlements of different sizes. The largest community was La Sierra, which included the residences of some of the region's elite fam- ilies, who lived in expansive palatial buildings surrounding courtyards, patios, plazas, and a ball- court. La Sierra's residents had direct access to ex- tensive clay deposits and other natural resources, as well as a host of domestic workshops whose in- habitants manufactured a range of both utilitarian and luxury goods, including kiln-fired pottery and figurines, prismatic obsidian blades, and pos- sibly textiles. Initially, during the Late Classic (ca. A.D. 600-800), the manufacture of these items was limited to La Sierra, yet the products were widely distributed throughout the valley (Schortman et al. 2001; Urban et al. 1997). One hypothesis to account for this pattern is that La Sierra's political leaders and their families ex- changed locally manufactured craft items with valley farmers for subsistence resources and, pos- sibly, surplus labor (Schortman and Urban 1994). As a result, rural farmers may have lost their au- tonomy in decision making and other political realms as they grew reliant upon La Sierra's elite for some of the material necessities of daily life. Later, in the Terminal Classic (ca. A.D. 800-1000), specialized workshops and their prod- ucts became more widespread throughout the val- ley, suggesting dispersal of power networks (Schortman and Urban 2004, 2012). Our recent archaeological investigations in the environs of the Naco Valley have sought to test these ideas by examining the political and ritual</page><page sequence="4">THEMED REPORT SECTION ON MICROBOTANICAL AND MULTI-PROXY ANALYSIS 85 Figure 2. Archaeological sites in the Palmarejo Valley, Honduras, showing the location of Palos Blancos in regional context. economy of outlying settlements in La Sierra's hinterland (Wells and Davis-Salazar 2008). Since 2003, we have mapped and investigated the re- mains of 96 settlements of varying size and shape that were arranged into five spatially discrete com- munities spread throughout the Palmarejo Valley (Figure 2), all of which appear to have been oc- cupied throughout the Classic period, ca. A.D. 400-1000, based on ceramic seriation and radio- carbon assays of samples obtained from stratified deposits (Davis-Salazar, Moreno-Cortés, and Wells 2007; Davis-Salazar et al. 2005; Wells et al. 2004, 2006, 2008). Most of these settlements rep- resent villages and farmsteads, situated on rich agricultural soils created by the merger of colluvial fans from flanking mountain ranges. Based on the presence of probable prehispanic agricultural ter- races, water management features, the distribution of field houses (single, low-lying buildings lo- cated at least 100 m away from residential settle- ment), and local geomorphology, all of the com- munities appear to have been variously engaged in agricultural pursuits (Darley 201 1 ; Hawken 2007; Klinger 2008; Wells et al. 2013).</page><page sequence="5">86 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 25, No. 1, 2014] Figure 3. Plan view of Palos Blancos, showing the location of Structure 9 and the extent of excavation, along with Burials 58E-1 and 58E-2 and the marble vase. Palos Blancos is one of the larger settlements in the valley (Figure 3). This community has 42 buildings divided into two groups, both of which skirt the southern edge of an ancient seasonal stream. Our research at the site focused on the East Group, where we investigated one range-type building, Structure 9, which measures approxi- mately 10 m by 5 m (oriented 30 degrees az- imuth), reaches roughly 2 m in height, and forms the northeast boundary of one of the largest patio groups at the site. The building's overall rectan- gular shape and location in a patio group is con- sistent with residential compounds excavated elsewhere in the valley (Davis-Salazar et al. 2005; Novotný 2007). Excavations included a trench over the central axis of the building and associated horizontal clearing of the summit, probes at the four corners of the structure, and a block excava- tion (Operation 58E) on the north side of the building, which had been damaged slightly by an adjacent cattle path. Excavation of Structure 9 revealed that the building most likely served as an elite residence, composed of three superimposed terraces linked by a central staircase that leads to a summit once covered by a perishable superstructure made from wattle and daub. The top of the building supports a 5-m-long bench (a built-in platform, presumably used for sleeping) along the back wall and a pos- sible stone wall dividing the space into two inte- rior rooms. Materials recovered from the summit and from a deeply stratified midden off the back (east) side of the building include various forms of pottery bowls, jars, and plates, along with a vari- ety of stone tools and a few faunai remains. To- gether, the assemblages associated with the occu- pation of the building strongly suggest a residen- tial function (Davis-Salazar et al. 2005:10-17). During excavation of the north side of Struc- ture 9, we encountered a burial (Burial 58E-1) ap- proximately one meter below the ground surface containing the remains of a single adult (sex in- determinate) in a flexed position, oriented east-to- west, with the face looking to the south (Figure 4). The burial was sealed into the basal terrace of the edifice, oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the structure, and is thus likely associated with the building's initial construction, which we hypoth- esize took place in the Early Classic period, based on the presence of temporally-diagnostic Cham- elecon and Ulua (red) polychrome pottery found in the terrace fill. A second burial (Burial 58E-2, Figure 5) was uncovered 30-40 cm above Burial 58E-1, associated with a later remodeling of the building (Figure 6), which we hypothesize took place in the early part of the Late Classic, based on the presence of five Ulúa (maroon) poly- chrome sherds (Type Travesía: Variety Monkey) found in the fill associated with the remodeling. The Palos Blancos Vase The Ulua-style marble vase was found immedi- ately adjacent to the east side of the skull of Bur- ial 58E-1 , located approximately 10 cm horizon- tally from the temporal ridge of the cranium and over a burned patch of soil containing numerous charcoal fragments (Figure 7). Other burned patches of soil were found alongside the body, also containing charcoal deposits. The vase mea- sures 8.01 cm in diameter and 6.65 cm in height,</page><page sequence="6">THEMED REPORT SECTION ON MICROBOTANICAL AND MULTI-PROXY ANALYSIS 87 Figure 4. Plan view of Burial 58E-1 at Palos Blancos, showing the location of the marble vase and the charcoal samples dated (lettered A, F, G, H, and J). and its wall averages .48 cm thick; it weighs 3.48 kg. It has a cylindrical form with two handles, each in the shape of a head of a leaf-nosed bat ( Phyllostomidae ), similar to the main element of the Copán emblem glyph ( zotz [Stuart and Hous- ton 1994:23-25]). The body of the vase is deco- rated with rows and columns of volutes, offsetting a diamond-shaped symbol (sometimes interpreted as an "eye") placed on opposite sides, and capped on the top with a band of overlapping serpent scales. The vase is similar in form and design to Luke's (2003:23-26) "Group 2" vessels, espe- cially the example from the Gruener Collection of Pre-Columbian Art in the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA 1990.17.0; Young-Sánchez 1992:258; see also Stone 1938:27; von Winning 1968:310).

All data- including age, sex, pathological conditions, and cultural modification- were collected in accordance with the procedures outlined by Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). Age was estimated by dental wear or den- tal eruption, although when preservation allowed, epiphyseal closure, cranial suture, and pelvic mor- phology were also used. Sex was determined by a combination of cranial traits, pelvic morphology, and long bone measurements, as preservation al- lowed. Analysis of the dentition was undertaken according to the standards outlined in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994) and supplemented by Hillson (1996) and White and Folkens (2006). Pathologies were identified with reference to Ortner (2003). The bones of Burial 58E- 1 , sealed in the foun- dations of Structure 9, were those of an adult Figure 6.

Ulúa-style marble vase from Palos Blancos (photographs (upper) by Karla L. Davis-Salazar; drawings (lower) by José H. Espinoza). whose remains were too poorly preserved for any specific estimates of age, sex, or life history to be made; less than 25 percent of the skeleton was present. Several teeth were recovered, but most were fragmented. The bone fragments themselves were identifiable only as cranial and long bone fragments, but the outer surface of each bone had been worn away so thoroughly that no further information could be collected. The bones of Burial 58E-2, associated with the fill of a later building episode, were not well pre- served either and were very fragmented; how- ever, this individual was better preserved than Burial 58E-1. Less than 25 percent of the skele- ton was present. Remains consisted of cranial, rib, tarsal, and long bone fragments, as well as teeth. Sex was estimated to be probably male, and age at death was approximately young adult, 20-34, based on dental attrition. Dental pathologies (calculus, caries, and ante- mortem tooth loss) are common in prehispanic populations. Three teeth (LM3, LMļ, and RMj) showed carious lesions, and each tooth showed some degree of calculus build-up, from very lit- tle to a moderate amount. As carious lesions and calculus accumulation increase over time, their presence in Burial 58E-2 indicates slightly ad- vanced age (Hillson 2008). The left mandibular canine of the individual in Burial 58E-2 was lost antemortem, most likely due to periodontal dis- ease. The medial aspect of the alveolar socket (shared by the left mandibular incisor) was normal and the LI2 tooth was recovered. Frontal, occipital, and other cranial fragments of Burial 58E-2 showed slight, healed porotic hy- perostosis. This type of bone reaction could be the result of nutritional deficiencies, such as scurvy and certain types of anemia, and/or gastrointesti- nal infections. Iron-deficiency anemia is often cited as the cause of porotic hyperostosis among the ancient Maya, since their diet relied heavily on corn, a food low in iron and containing phytates that bind to iron and slow its absorption in the body (Wright and Chew 1998), a deficiency only partly addressed by nixtamalization.2 However, recent research suggests a different etiology for porotic hyperostosis among New World popula- tions. Walker and colleagues (2009:119) argue that porotic hyperostosis may be the result of anemia caused by the combined effects of vitamin B12 deficiency among nursing mothers and gas- trointestinal pathogens incurred by infants during weaning. Vitamin B12 is found in high quantities in animal protein, and lack of it results in mega-</page><page sequence="9">90 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 25, No. 1, 2014] Table 1 . Stable Isotope Data.

Children and adolescents are particularly prone to showing the effects of nutritional deficiencies in the cranium, as this is the primary location for their red blood cell production (Walker et al. 2009:111). The porotic hyperostosis on the cra- nium of Burial 58E-2 was healed at death, sug- gesting that the episode occurred early in life and therefore may have been the result of nutritional deficiency involving, in part, a lack of vitamin B12 in the diet of the mother and gastrointestinal par- asites or other infection in the infant. Faunai re- mains were scarce in the Palos Blancos excava- tions and would provide important information on the type and amount of protein available to those interred in Structure 9. Isotopes 15N and 13C from bone collagen, in particular, would clarify the amount of protein consumed by residents of Pa- los Blancos. Healed bone addition (sclerotic reaction) was observed on a midshaft fragment of the right tibia, the right ulna, and the left humerus. These reac- tions are likely evidence of localized infections due to soft tissue trauma that became infected and spread to the periosteal surface of the bone. All were well healed, suggesting that this indi- vidual was relatively healthy or well cared for in order to fight off such infections. Sclerotic reac- tions can also be indicative of systemic infec- tions, but there were not enough skeletal elements preserved to observe patterns of skeletal involve- ment from all parts of the body. Minor osteoarthritis was present on the distal epiphysis of the left radius and on the body of an unidentified vertebra, but it was not severe in ei- ther case, and would not have impeded move- ment. Osteoarthritis is common in prehistoric pop- ulations in this region (Buikstra et al. 2004; Storey 2005), even in individuals of a young age, and was most likely the result of everyday activities. Stable Isotope Analysis To examine aspects of diet and mobility of the in- dividuals connected to the marble vase through the mortuary context, dental enamel from both burials was subjected to multielemental stable isotope analysis (87Sr/86Sr, 8180, and 813C). Dental enamel from three additional burials located in other parts of the valley was also studied for comparison. A permanent first molar was selected from each in- dividual, since its enamel forms during late ges- tation and very early childhood and thus reflects the location where an individual was born (Hillson 1996). The isotopes 180 and 13C of tooth enamel carbonate were measured using an automated car- bonate preparation device (KIEL-III) coupled to a gas-ratio mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT 252). The isotope ratio 87Sr/86Sr was measured on a Nu Plasma HR (Nu Instruments, Inc.), a high resolu- tion multi-collector, double-focusing, plasma- source mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). Details of sample preparation and analysis can be found in Price at al. (2002, 2008). The results of these analyses appear in Table 1 . Strontium and oxygen isotope ratios, as recorded in human bone and teeth, can reveal ge- ographic regions where individuals grew up, as opposed to where they died (Price et al. 2010:22-30).3'4 Due to poor preservation, only teeth were analyzed from the Palmarejo Valley. Carbonate in dental enamel is more resistant to di- agenetic contamination than bone carbonate (Budd et al. 2000; Koch et al. 1997). Because first molars were sampled, the isotope values pre- sented here represent residence and diet of indi- viduals between birth and three years of age. A scatterplot comparing the strontium and oxygen isotope data from the Palmarejo Valley burials shows that the individuals from Palos Blancos are distinct from those from the rest of the valley</page><page sequence="10">THEMED REPORT SECTION ON MICROBOTANICAL AND MULTI-PROXY ANALYSIS 91 -3.2000-1 Site ■ B Morro ■ • Patmarejo •3.4000- A Patos Blancos -3.6000- -3.8000- O 00 T3 • -4.0000- -4.2000- A -4.4000- A - I 1 I 1- .708000 .708200 .706400 .708600 87Sr*B6Sr Figure 8. Scatterplot of strontium and oxygen isotope ratios from the Palos Blancos burials, compared to those from two other prominent settlements in the valley, Palmarejo and El Morro. (Figure 8). 5 Compared to the individuals from the site of Palmarejo, both the strontium and oxy- gen isotope values vary distinctively for the indi- viduals from Palos Blancos, although this differ- ence is not statistically significant at the a = .05 level (Mann- Whitney, U = .00, z = -1 .55, p = .12). This finding, together with the presence of the Ulúa-style marble vase in the burial context and associated Ulua polychromes in the building's construction fill, may suggest that some of the early Palos Blancos residents emigrated from the nearby Ulua Valley. It is also possible that infant weaning and supplementation practices differed between social groups in the Palmarejo Valley or between people in the Ulúa Valley and the Pal- marejo Valley (Wright 2013; Wright and Schwarcz 1998). These possibilities merit fur- ther evaluation for the Palos Blancos burials with comparable isotope data from the Ulua Valley. Carbon isotope ratios may be used to under- stand aspects of diet, due to differential fraction- ation of atmospheric carbon dioxide during pho- tosynthesis between C3 plants such as temperate grasses and C4 plants such as maize and other tropical grasses (Tykot 2004:434-436). 6 Stable carbon isotope data from the Palmarejo Valley suggest that maize (or some other C4 plant) was an important- but not central- part of the diet for all individuals in the study.7 However, there is a fair amount of variation within this sample, from -3.5 %c to -5.1%c. This variation most likely reflects differential access to maize over time and could signal differences in social status (Scherer et al. 2007; White and Schwarcz 1989). That the in- dividual in Burial 58E-2 from Palos Blancos ex- perienced porotic hyperostosis (probably caused by dietary deficiencies), supports the idea that di- etary consumption among these individuals em- phasized maize at the expense of vitamin B12-rich animal proteins (Walker et al. 2009). Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of bone collagen from these individuals, along with isotopie studies of local fauna, could help to evaluate this idea by providing further insight into animal protein con- sumption at Palos Blancos (Tykot et al. 1996). Phosphate Chemistry Seven samples of sediment from in and around the vase were analyzed for acid-extractable phos- phate in order to determine the extent to which or- ganic material was originally present in the ves- sel, as signaled by elevated levels of phosphate (Holliday and Gartner 2007; Wells and Moreno- Cortés 2010). The results were compared to seven control samples obtained from outside the ar- chaeological zone in soil strata of the same depth and presumed age (based on similar stratigraphy and geomorphology near Structure 9) and in areas that lack evidence for prehispanic human occu- pation or use. A 2.0 g portion was selected from each sample and mixed with 20 ml of dilute Mehlich II acid (a combination of acetic, hydrochloric, and hydro- fluoric acids with ammonium chloride, diluted 1:10 with TVpe II deionized water) to extract phosphate from the samples, following the pro- cedures outlined by Terry et al. (2000) and by Wells et al. (2000). 8 A DR/890 colorimeter was used to quantify the concentration of phosphates in solution. Instrument blanks (Mehlich II) were processed with all samples, and sample concen- trations were corrected for deviations from these standards. The results appear in Table 2. The samples as- sociated with the vessel contain concentrations of phosphate that are significantly elevated com- pared to the control ("background") samples</page><page sequence="11">92 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 25, No. 1 , 2014] Table 2.

(Mann- Whitney U = 14.00, z = 2.05, p = .04). When compared to phosphate levels detected in local anthropogenic soils (see Rothenberg 2010:Table 5.1), the sediments inside the vase have roughly four times higher concentrations of phosphate, strongly suggesting the deposition and long-term persistence of organic matter inside the vase. This finding gives us confidence that the results of our pollen analysis (described below) are not spurious and do represent the original contents of the vase. Pollen Analysis Nine pollen samples from inside and around the vase were analyzed to establish a profile for the vase's contents. Two samples (58E/1 and 58E/2) came from sediment underlying the vase in an area that contained evidence of burning (Davis- Salazar et al. 2005:13), five samples (58E/3, 58E/4, 58E/5, 58E/6, and 58E/7) consist of or- ganic-rich sediment from the interior of the ves- sel, and two samples (58E/8 and 58E/9) derive from soil overlying the vase near the second bur- ial (Davis-Salazar et al. 2005:15). The samples were processed by extracting 20 cc sub-samples and adding roughly 37,200 grains of Lycopodium spores to serve as tracers for calcu- lating pollen concentrations. Carbonates were re- moved by soaking the sample in dilute 10 percent hydrochloric acid. The sample was then immersed in hydrofluoric acid for 20 hours to break down sil- icates, followed by floating the sample in a zinc bromide solution (specific gravity 1 .9) to separate lighter organic materials, including pollen, from heavier inorganic materials. Extraneous organic matter was removed by rinsing the sample with an acetolysis mixture (nine parts acetic anhydride to one part concentrated sulfuric acid) and placing the sample in a boiling water bath. The acetolysis mix- ture was decanted off, and the sample was then washed with glacial acetic acid and rinsed with demineralized water. The resulting polleniferous extract was rinsed in alcohol and stored in glycerol in one-dram vials. Pollen extracts were mounted, stained, and analyzed following the procedures outlined in Stuart (2007). 9 Palynomorph counts are presented in Table 3. All of the pollen samples proved to be productive. The 58E/2 sample likely relates directly to the ac- tivities that resulted in the coloring of the sedi- ment underneath the vase. Thus, the relatively high percentage of pollen of the Urticales order- which consists of pollen of various families and several different taxa, including Ficus sp., Trema sp., and Cecropia sp.- may relate to the collec- tion of woody material, with some pollen (and flowers?) still remaining, and subsequent burning of the woody material at this location. All of the Burial 58E-1 samples are domi- nated by grass (Poaceae) pollen. The grass pollen likely reflects the dominant vegetation in the im- mediate area of the burial. However, one of the two samples from the organic area of Burial 58E- 2 also contains pollen of potential paleoethnob- otanical significance. Sample 58 E/9 has a fairly high percentage (13/217 grains = 6.0 percent) of Connarus- type (zebrawood) pollen; a large genus of tropical trees and shrubs, including those prized for woodworking. While not diagnostic, this same sample also contains one grain whose morphology is at least consistent with pollen of Psychotria emetica (false ipecac), an herb that has emetic properties similar to those of ipecac.</page><page sequence="12">THEMED REPORT SECTION ON MICROBOTANICAL AND MULTI-PROXY ANALYSIS 93 Table 3.

Unfortunately, cacao does not have a particularly distinctive pollen morphology, nor were these grains particularly well preserved. More conclusive evidence of paleoethnob- otanical significance was observed in the vessel- fill pollen samples. Maize pollen composes al- most two percent (1.7 percent) of the vessel-fill pollen assemblage and was observed in four of the five samples (ubiquity of 80 percent). This is in- terpretively significant, as these values are com- parable to values derived directly from modern cultivated Mesoamerican maize fields, where maize was found to comprise between .5 to 4.0 percent of the assemblage, with ubiquities of 50 to 80 percent (see Stuart 2003:280-281, Table 6.5). It therefore seems likely that maize in some form was placed directly into the vessel. Given the context, this strongly suggests that the vessel contained a maize offering, possibly a corn gruel such as atole. Although the likelihood of maize pollen surviving the processing sequence leading to maize flour seems low, this would, neverthe- less, explain the relatively high percentages and ubiquity of maize pollen and is consistent with the</page><page sequence="13">94 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 25, No. 1, 2014] Table 4.

Radiocarbon Dating Using AMS radiocarbon dating, we obtained ab- solute dates for the vase deposit from five wood charcoal specimens recovered from the burial de- posit and offering. We assayed five samples to be able to consider the trend of the samples, which provides a general estimate of the actual date of de- position of the vase and can allow for the identifi- cation and removal of outliers (Buck et al. 1994; Christen and Buck 1998). We did not date com- posite samples (i.e., those aggregated from multi- ple contexts), and only whole pieces larger than .5 cm3 were submitted for dating. For each sample, a clean trowel was used to avoid cross-contamination between samples. The samples were stored in ster- ilized polyethylene bags to avoid additions of new 14C from the packaging, and the bags were sealed airtight to avoid atmospheric 14C. The results are shown in Table 4. For the in- terpretation of radiocarbon dates, we followed the practices suggested by Dean (1991) and by Eighmy and LaBelle (1996), which advocate the use of calibrated dates expressed as intervals that can then be modeled with Bayesian statistics (Buck et al. 1996) or simulation approaches (Crema 2012). Our dates were calibrated using the software program IntCal04 (http://www.radio- carbon.org/IntCal04.htm), based on a high-preci- sion calibration curve that has an estimated error of less than 20 years (Hughen et al. 2004; Reimer et al. 2004). The calendar calibrations were com- puted using the Pretoria Calibration Procedure (Vogel et al. 1993), which uses splines through tree-ring data (from oak, sequoia, and fir up to ca. 10,000 B.P.) as calibration curves. We used "BCal" (a Bayesian radiocarbon cal- ibration tool, http://bcal.shef.ac.uk) to model the calibrated intervals and "CALIB" (http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib) to plot the curves for the calibrated dates and the pooled probabil- ity date range (Figure 9). We used a floating pa- rameter of A.D. 700 ± 50 (with no other absolute prior information) to post-date the organic mate- rials associated with the vase. This parameter is the estimate offered by Luke (2002) for "Group 2" Ulua-style vessels that include a bat motif, such as the Palos Blancos vase. Figure 9. A normalized (p = 1.0) pooled probability date range (showing lo and 2o intervals) for the calibrated dates (n = 4) associated with the marble vase.</page><page sequence="14">THEMED REPORT SECTION ON MICROBOTANICAL AND MULTI-PROXY ANALYSIS 95 The results produced a pooled mean date of cal 2a A.D. 635 ± 72, or a range of cal A.D. 563-707, for the organic material associated with the vase. This pooled mean date supports Luke's (2002) chronological assessment of A.D. 650-750 based on her stylistic seriation of Ulua polychrome pot- tery, although the radiocarbon dates suggest the earlier part of the range for this particular vessel. This date places the deposition of the vase around the end of the Early Classic or the beginning of the Late Classic. The dating results also indicate that the vase was placed as an offering in the burial ap- proximately a century after the body was origi- nally interred (cal 2a A.D. 495 ± 85 or cal A.D. 410-580). Comparing the pooled mean of the vase dates against the upper limit of the burial date (A.D. 580) suggests that the two events (burial of the body and interment of the vase) did not occur simultaneously ( t - 2.15, df= l,p = .07). Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the Palos Blancos vase was cached as mortuary furniture up to a century after the interment of the individual in Burial 58E-1 associated with Structure 9, pos- sibly as a gift or offering before the second phase of construction of the building was begun. Stable isotope data suggest that the individuals interred in Structure 9 were immigrants or visitors to the Palmarejo Valley, perhaps from the region of the Ulua Valley. The vase held a maize offering, pos- sibly in the form of a corn-based beverage. With- out comparative material, it is difficult to specu- late whether these contents are unique or represent a typical use of these kinds of vessels. However, corn-based drinks, most often atole in southern Mesoamerica, are common in this region today, as they were in prehispanic times (Beliaev et al. 2010; Green 2010). Several examples of ceramic vessels containing maize and cacao have been unearthed recently in mortuary contexts at Copán in western Honduras (McNeil 2010; McNeil et al. 2006). Regardless of the contents of the vase, we fol- low Hendon (2010:110-121) in interpreting the vase's inclusion in the mortuary program as a memorial act designed to transform the dead into an ancestor (see also Gillespie 2001; McAnany 1995). "These practices contribute to the con- struction and reconstruction of identity, place, and memory for members of the memory com- munities concerned" (Hendon 2010:119). Al- though we do not know the motives of the Palos Blancos residents for recognizing the person in Burial 58E-1 , it is clear that, by reopening the bur- ial context to add the marble vase (along with other attendant rites as suggested by the patches of burned soil), their actions effectively indexed the social relations of the community at that time and simultaneously historicized the dwelling across generations (Joyce 2003; McAnany et al. 1999). In addition to new information on the context and contents of an Ulua-style marble vase, the ra- diocarbon dates associated with the Palos Blancos vessel constitute the first series of chronometric dates associated with an Ulua-style marble vase. Much of our knowledge of the dating of marble vases from this region is based on relative ceramic chronology, mainly cross-ties with seriated pot- tery assemblages. Luke (2002; Luke et al. 2003) has created a testable chronology of Ulua-style marble vases based on their distribution and as- sociation with Ulua polychrome pottery. Accord- ing to Luke (2002), vases with bird, bat, and mon- key handles (ca. A.D. 650-750) appear to predate those with feline and serpent characteristics (ca. A.D. 750-850). Evidence in support of this hy- pothesis includes stylistic similarities with bird and bat designs found on early Late Classic Lug Head Ulua maroon polychromes, specifically Bombero and Paloma varieties from the western Ulúa Valley (Joyce 1993) and from the Copán re- gion (Viel 1978). Marble vases with feline char- acteristics are found mainly in the central Maya lowlands in late Late Classic contexts, ca. A.D. 800-850 (e.g., Kidder 1947:36-37; Pendergast 1990:236-238; Thompson 1939:167). Our find- ings support Luke's suggestion for the bat-han- dled vases, but hint at the possibility that the manufacture of this group of design styles may have been initiated slightly earlier than the A.D. 650-750 range that she identifies. Our AMS results contribute to a much-needed calibrated radiocarbon chronology for Ulua mar- ble vases. In addition, seriation-based temporal phases of specific ceramic types commonly as- sociated with Ulua-style marble vases, such as certain varieties of Ulua polychromes, may now</page><page sequence="15">96 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 25, No. 1, 2014] be evaluated with absolute date ranges. By using this comparative method, for example, assump- tions based on the uniformity of Naco and Ulúa ceramic chronologies across multiple regions (e.g., Joyce 1993; Urban 1993) may now be ex- plored with calendar dates. We hope that an ef- fective Ulúa marble vase radiocarbon chronology from northwest Honduras will help bridge the gap that currently exists for the vases, which are dated only by ceramic cross-ties and by associa- tion with settlement sites that are dated by radio- carbon techniques. By filling this gap, it will be possible for the first time to compare marble vases from multiple contexts directly and to help de- termine the meaning of their stylistic differences.

An earlier version of a portion of this article was prepared by Wells (2007). 2. Nixtamalization- the process of soaking maize in an al- kali solution such as water treated with slaked lime- improves the nutritional value of maize by eliminating phytates; lower- ing the leucine/isoleucine ratio; enhancing the bioavailability of niacin, lysine, and tryptophan; and increasing calcium con- tent (Bressani et al. 1958; Bressani and Scrimshaw 1958; Katz et al. 1974; Wright 2006:109-111). 3. Strontium isotope signatures (87Sr/86Sr) vary regionally based on the composition and age of bedrock (Bentley 2006; Faure and Powell 1972). Baseline strontium data from the ge- ologic region of study are necessary to accurately interpret hu- man strontium levels. A baseline is in progress for northwest Honduras, although there are values already available for com- parison from the site of Copán (Price et al. 2010). 4. Stable oxygen isotope values (8180) vary within water sources across environments according to latitude, altitude, dis- tance from the ocean, and temperature (Longinelli 1984; Luz and Kolodny 1989). Weaning also affects ô180 values, as breast milk is enriched in 180 compared to drinking water. Weaning must be taken into account when assessing mobility from teeth formed during breastfeeding, such as first molars, as they may not match the local 180 values (Hillson 2008; Knudson 2009; Wright and Schwartz 1998). 5. For the total sample, mean enamel 87Sr/86Sr = .7082974 ± .000234 (n = 5, Ict). The mean for Palmarejo Valley burials is .708415 ± .000220 (n = 3, Ict) and .7081205 ± .000135 for the burials interred with the marble vase at Palos Blancos. For the total sample, mean enamel 8180 = -3.93%o ± .42 (n = 5, 1er). The mean for Palmarejo Valley burials is -3.66%o ± .27 (n = 3, Ict) and -4.32%o ± .15 (n = 2, 1er) for the Palos Blancos burials. 6. The 813C data for the present study were obtained from carbonate in dental enamel apatite and reflects whole diet plus 9.4%o, while collagen reflects carbon from consumed protein (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Ambrose et al. 1997:350). 7. Mean 813C isotope data for the total sample is -4.36%o ± .69 (n = 5, Ict). The mean for the burials from Palos Blan- cos is -4.15%c ± .58 (n = 2, 1er). This is slightly lower than the mean for the burials from the greater Palmarejo Valley, -4.49%o ±.85 (n = 3, Ict). 8. Samples were placed in test tubes and mixed on an or- bital benchtop shaker at 200 rpm for five minutes. The sedi- ment grains were then filtered out of solution using quantita- tive-grade ashless (.007 percent) filter paper and an acetone-rinsed glass funnel. The resulting solution was col- lected in a sterilized glass scintillation vial. The contents of a Phos Ver 3 powder pillow (ascorbic acid, potassium pyrosul- fate, and sodium molybdate; available from Hach, Inc.) were added to the solution and agitated until it dissolved (approxi- mately one minute), and then allowed to stand for two minutes. Through a reduction reaction with the acid, the pillow changes to blue molybdenum compounds in the presence of phosphate. 9. Pollen extracts were mounted in glycerol and stained with saffranin to aid in identification. A Nikon Optiphot microscope was used to view the slides at 400x magnification to obtain 200 grain counts. Pollen grain identification was facilitated through comparison to reference collections and published pollen guides (e.g., Kapp et al. 2000; Roubik and Moreno Patino 1991). Iden- tification was to the lowest taxonomie level possible. Pollen per- centages were calculated from the 200 grain count; concentra- tions were calculated by multiplying the ratio of the number of pollen grains counted to tracers counted by tracer concentration divided by sample volume.
