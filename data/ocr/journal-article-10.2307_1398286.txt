<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edward J. Machle Hsun Tzu as a religious philosopher One of the widely acknowledged sides of Hsiin Tzu, the great Confucian philosopher of the third century B.C., is his work as a critic of religion. He subjected many religious currents of his time to philosophical criticism. Belief in ghosts, phrenology and similar superstitions, praying in order to cause rain, belief that natural calamities were divine punishments, and determining policies by augury all felt the edge of his attack. Even overweening interest in the secrets of nature moved him to analysis and rejection. It is then no wonder that he has commonly been pictured as a thoroughgoing secularist and enemy of religion, or, as Rosemont puts it, an "avowed atheist." I have not found anything in the literature that could be called an attempt to deal with Hsiin Tzu not as a philosopher of religion but as a religious philo- sopher. Here and there one may find hints that this might be possible: Hughes, for instance, speaks of Hsiin Tzu's "spiritual" philosophy.' Yet the received interpretation has its almost complete way. By "religious philosopher" I mean a thinker whose philosophizing has some guiding religious motivation. He is a philosopher rather than a theologian, because he speaks for the "reasonable man" of his culture rather than for some particular worshipping community, but like the theologian, he seeks to make sense of the received religious tradition as a way of continuing to be part of it. For the former reason, he does not shrink from criticizing dearly held practices or beliefs; for the latter, he holds not a purely rational goal of pristine clarity in analysis or neat consistency in system-building, but one of edification of himself and others. A religious philosopher is not a prophet. By this I mean he does not, and cannot, add significantly to the religious materials available to his times. He draws on them, restructures them, reinterprets them, perhaps rejects many of them. When finished, he may claim, "This is what they always really meant." But he is essentially a renovator, not a regenerator. Was Hsiin Tzu moved by religious concerns, to at least some extent? The received interpretations deny it. The Marxists claim him as a prime spokesman for the materialism implicit in the working-man's outlook, though they do argue over just how much his materialism contributed to revolutionary progress. The Chinese impressed with the Western scientific outlook have acclaimed his naturalism, and Western scholars have read his view of Nature as one of the closest approaches in all of Chinese thought to a thoroughly secular stance, affirming natural law and even mechanism. It is in connection with Hsiin Tzu that Liu Wu-chi remarks that "in the third century B.C. the Chinese lost their spiritual soul" ;2 and Fung Yu-lan maintains that Hsiin Tzu never Edward J. Machle is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. NOTE: Research for this article was supported, in part, by a grant from the American Philosophical Society.

Modern Chinese scholars are the heirs of Neo-Confucian scholarship, which read Hsiin Tzu out of the Confucian party, most apparently because he rejected Mencius' views on human nature and moral energy, which Neo-Confucianism took as its basis for affirming a spiritual continuity between man and the highest sphere of "Heaven-and- Earth." His rejection of this basis for their belief led them to see him as crass, antispiritual, and two dimensional, guilty of what Niebuhr has called "self- satisfied finitude." Bringing to flower what had been living within Confucianism all along, the faith in the moral continuity between Nature and human nature, they were ill-disposed to believe they had any alternative to Mencius. More recently, the picture changed. As Yang tells us In the twentieth century, when the dominance of Western influence brought contempt for superstition and magic as the very sign of national backwardness, a new generation of Chinese scholars, such as Chang T'ai-yen, Liang Ch'i-ch'ao, Ch'en Tu-hsiu, and Hu Shih, came forth to defend the dignity of Chinese civilization not only by stressing the rationalistic view of the Confucian doctrine but also by claiming that the dominance of Confucian orthodoxy had helped develop China into a "rationalistic society" where there was neither a powerful priesthood nor protracted struggle between religion and the state.4 Such scholars, stressing the secular and rational character of Confucian thought, could hardly treat Hsiin Tzu, the left-wing Confucian, as anything but their antireligious and proscientific ally. Western sinologists, reading into Chinese cultural history Western Enlightenment biases regarding the relationships of science, nature, reason, ritual, and religion, tended to go along with the trend. Once again, Hsiin Tzu was celebrated for his agnosticism and naturalism. One difficulty all along has been the lack of a consistent tradition of inter- pretation from the earliest days. It is noteworthy that Ssu-ma Ch'ien, writing of Hsiin Tzu scarcely a century and a half after the philosopher's death, says nothing of his religious views but implies that he was apparently against "attending to magic and prayers, and believing in omens and luck."5 Since this is the only real biographical source we have regarding him, we cannot go much beyond the guess that his views on religion were not a lively topic of discussion in the second century B.C. His texts were collected around 76 B.C., but there seems to be no trace of any continuing or systematic study of his work for nine hundred years thereafter. The received tradition of serious study dates from Yang Liang in 818, who seems to have had no previous Hsiin Tzu scholarship on which to draw. We are thus really left with the text itself, general background knowledge, and scholarship of a far later age. The grounds for painting Hsiin Tzu as antireligious seem to be: (1) his criticisms of widespread beliefs as superstitious; (2) his apparent denial of the existence of spirits, particularly spirits of the dead; (3) his treatment of ritual as</page><page sequence="3">445 "mere ornament" which nevertheless had some educational function in molding men's emotional life; (4) his apparent denial of an anthropomorphic Heaven- deity; (5) his belief that man is evil by nature, implying that the Nature that gives man human nature is itself evil, or at best morally irrelevant; (6) his suggestions that nature may be technologically exploited rather than revered; and (7) his widespread, often dominating concern with matters political, economic, legal, and educational. These must be set over against the fact that Hsiin Ch'ing aimed at being and claimed to be nothing but the best possible Confucian, and whatever "Con- fucianism" has been down through the centuries, it has always been in some sense religious even when not a religion. To quote Yang again, "Modern students of China who maintain the purely rationalistic view of Confucianism are not able to explain away the religious aspects of the doctrine without distorting the meaning of the original texts."6 It is striking that discussion of the preceding seven points revolve around relatively very few loci in the Hsiin tzu corpus, often without relating them to whatever contrary evidence there may be. Some of these loci are important, certainly, and merit much discussion. The chief issue is whether they are to be given an interpretation which then controls our reading of the entire corpus, or whether they are to be considered as a few items among many, all needing mutual interpretation. II The task of reexamining the established position has two steps: we must show both that the received view is without adequate foundation and that there is a viable alternative to it. The former enterprise requires analysis of the grounds for the received view, an analysis that itself provides the basis for calling it into question. Only if the received view is shaken can the presentation of an alter- native be a serious gesture. Fortunately, attacking one view often suggests, of itself, an alternative. We pointed out the seven points upon which the idea that Hsiin was anti- religious, or at least irreligious, rests. One of these, his absorption with political, economic, legal, and educational matters, can be set aside quite simply, since religious leaders from Moses to Martin Luther King have shown their most extensive concerns often to be such matters. The decision whether these are also religious concerns must be decided in light of the particular man's religious orientation, which is what is here at issue. Such interests do not of themselves count for or against the existence of such an orientation, particularly, one might add, in a Chinese thinker. Another of these frequently appealed to points, Hsin tzu's "technological" or "scientific" interest, I believe to be based on an unfortunate collocation of misreadings and Western scientific biases. Since I am developing an argument on this point elsewhere, let it suffice here to point out its dependence upon another point, namely, Hsiin Tzu's so-called naturalistic view of Heaven.</page><page sequence="4">446 Machle Without this latter claim, the claim of a technological vision on his part would have no foundation. Still another of the alleged grounds may be quite summarily reduced. That he gives a psychological account of ritual, when speaking of ritual in nonritual contexts, would be reduction only if his psychology is reductionistic. Though this has been claimed quite blandly, I have found in the literature no worked-out case for it as over against alternatives. If an author's own psychology is itself religiously reductionist, or if on the basis of other things, such as his view of the evil of human nature, an author assumes Hsiin's psychology to be so, this argument might gain some apparent force. But many a devout handbook of religious discipline is full of psychologizing, even about sacred matters. The interpretation of Hsiin's psychological treatment of ritual is part of the question of his religious motivations, not an independent ground on which to support an answer. Likewise, his view of man's natural or innate evil may be set aside for the present. Although it does set him against Mencius and the religious affinities of the latter's followers, only an investigation of the other points can make it clear whether this is a religious opposition, in some sense, rather than an opposition to religion. That later followers of Mencius took it to be a rejection of "the principle of sublime transcendence" means only it was a rejection of their principle, no more. We are thus left, at least in the main, with two areas that count independently for a nonreligious interpretation of Hsiin Tzu: his critiques of superstition (including belief in spirits) and his "naturalistic" view of nature. We shall take these up in order. III When we turn to his criticisms of superstition, we find two quite different sorts of cases. In the one, there is no disagreement as to what he is attacking, or how, or why. He overthrows physiognomy and related fortune-tellings, for instance, by amassing counterexample after counterexample to show their intenability. His reason for attacking them is not scientific, but moral and practical, since evaluating men by their appearance cannot conduce to a moral, and, hence, responsible and successful administration. As he puts it, to physiognomize a person's appearance is not as good as to consider his heart; considering his heart is not as good as to select his principles.... When a person's principles are upright and his heart obeys them, although his physiognomy be repulsive, yet if his heart and principles are good, his physiognomy will not hinder him from being a superior man (v, Dubs, p. 67).7 Physiognomy is not merely empirically false, it usurps the place of proper moral evaluation. Such moral criticism of superstition, of course, is not of itself irreligious; it can as easily reflect a critical but deeply religious mind.</page><page sequence="5">447 Were all his positions as clear-cut as that against physiognomy, this article would have no reason to exist. Consider the following celebrated passage: You pray for rain and it rains. Why? For no particular reason, I say. It is just as though you had not prayed for rain and it rained anyway.... But it is not as though you could hope to accomplish anything by such ceremonies. They are done merely for ornament. Hence the gentleman regards them as ornaments, but the common people regard them as supernatural. He who considers them ornaments is fortunate; he who considers them supernatural is unfortunate (xvii, Watson p. 85).8 This is Watson's translation. The following alternative translation points up the problem of deciding just what he did say: When we sacrifice for rain, it rains. Why? I say, there is nothing to ask 'why?' about. It rains even though we don't sacrifice.... This isn't something to be regarded from the point of view of obtaining something we seek, but from a cultured standpoint. Consequently, although the gentleman looks on it as a matter of humane culture, the lower gentry see it as a matter of dealing with spirits. Regard it as a matter of humane culture and good fortune follows; regard it as a matter of dealings with spirits and misfortune follows.9 Though this passage is often cited as evidence that Hsiin Tzu denied the existence of spirits, that is certainly not what he is doing. The matter of belief that he concerns himself with is belief in the efficacy of rituals to effect some change in events independently of their place in the total lives and development of the people involved. It is the business of men to deal with nature only according to ia--that is, only through the proper development of their characters and institutions, two things intimately connected in his view. It pertains to man to be related to Heaven wholesale, not piecemeal; as a human world focused in the equality with Heaven that characterizes the Sage. Anything else is counterproductive, and produces just those unfortunate consequences that the vulgar view ritual as the means to avoid. Compare the passage just quoted with another well-known one, A man, having contracted a chill from the dampness, proceeds to beat a drum and make an offering of a pig in hopes of effecting a cure. He wears out the drum and loses a pig in the process, that is certain, but no blessing of recovery follows as a result (xxi, Watson, p. 135). Both passages deny the physical efficacy of rituals. The first, however, deals with rituals that Hsiin Tzu approves, rituals which add to the enrichment of communal human life. Such rituals produce in his eyes, as far as we can tell, no ill effects as rituals, whatever the materials they consume. Ill effects come not from their celebration, but from the expectation of particular effect, which encourages confusion regarding the proper separation of what is human and what is of Heaven. In the second case, however, two evil results are presented as accruing: ineffectiveness and the waste of the ritual materials. Apparently the folk ritual for illness cannot have the humanizing effect that a prayer for rain may have.</page><page sequence="6">448 Machle One may suspect that Hsiin distinguishes two sorts of rituals: rituals which are not part of li, but merely of folklore, are superstitious; rituals which are part of li are a proper part of the Tao of man, though not to be considered part of the tao of Heaven. It is worth noting that the example of the man with the chill occurs in a context arguing that men's judgments are unreliable when swayed by emotion. The story is preceded by, and explicitly associated with, the following tale: There was a man ... who lived south of Hsia-shou.... One night he was walking in the moonlight when, glancing down and seeing his shadow, he took it for a crouching ghost. Looking up, he caught sight of his own hair and took it for a devil standing over him. He whirled around and started running, and when he reached his home he fell unconscious and died. Is this not sad? Always when people see ghosts, it is at times when they are aroused and excited, and they make their judgments in moments when their faculties are confused and blinded (xxi, Watson p. 134-135). Apparently he is maintaining that, were the first man well, he would know better than to believe that a drum-and-pig ritual would cure a chill. Sick, he confuses what is of man and what is of Heaven, and so makes a fool of himself. The point being made is that people's judgments, even their perceptions, are impaired when they are emotionally upset. To make this point Hsiin must take for granted that his readers will already agree that claims to have seen ghosts are very questionable claims, whose dubitableness need not be estab- lished. He is not arguing the falsity of the superstitions; he is using an already established belief in their falsity to make another point. Evidently the process that Mo Ti objected to so much earlier, that men were giving up their belief in ghosts that punish, had proceeded a long way before Hsiin's time. What this shows us is that however else Confucianism in his day was still religious, it did not find need for belief in retributive spirits. Nor did it have to. It is already quite clear in Mencius that the good man does right because it is right, and for no other reason; Mo Ti's need for belief in such spirits was already undercut. If this be sound interpretation, we do not find Hsiin Tzu actively denying that spirits exist. Instead, he accepts what appear to be widespread doubts regarding the kueib, the dark, disorderly and at times hungry and vengeful spooks. Here, however, the expectation that his readers share these doubts simply shows he took his place within an already existing tradition of doubt. Similarly, the word for the magical powers of diviners and spooks-ling"- occurs in his writings only in proper names, in noticeable contrast to the Lao tzu and the Chuang tzu. In this, however, he simply agrees with both Confucius and Mencius, and apparently stands well within their tradition. IV What then did Hsiin Tzu maintain regarding spirits? A proper place to begin the discussion of the place of spirits within Confucianism is with the famous</page><page sequence="7">449 remark of Confucius in the Analects 6:20, "To respect spiritual beings (kuei shend), maintaining a proper distance in one's relations with them, may be called wisdom." "Maintaining a proper distance" is a question of li, of ritual or propriety. Hsiin Tzu here clearly follows his master's example, although probably going beyond it in holding that the expectations of particular results do not accord with li and bring about misfortune. Both men would surely hold that truly following li brings about only good. A further note may be sounded. Confucius uses the phrase kuei shen, "spooks and spirits" or "yin-spirits and yang-spirits" to stand for the whole realm of spiritual powers under Heaven. Kuei and shen are never associated in the Hsin tzu, or for that matter in the Mencius or the Great Learning (Ta Hsuehe). Distinction between them is most striking in the Hsin tzu, where shen is used nearly forty times, but kuei, outside of quotations, only four times. Moreover, these four times are all of them highly pejorative in tone, while shen appears in contexts of the very highest approval. It is understandable that the pejorative passages speaking of kuei are widely quoted to show the sage's rejection of both shen and kuei. But although shen may perhaps be used to include both kuei and shen, I know of no instance where kuei embraces both. We may conclude that Hsfin's opposition to super- stitions involving kuei is not so easily extended to beliefs and practices involving shen as many have taken it to be. An instance of this occurs in his treatment of funeral rites. Contrasting high culture with lack of sophistication, he says, The sage understands them, the gentleman finds comfort in carrying them out, the officials are careful to maintain them, and the common people accept them as custom. To the gentleman they are a part of the way (Tao) of man, to the common people they are something pertaining to the spirits (kuei), (literally, "ghost-serving") (xix, Watson, p. 110). When he is speaking seriously about the meaning of the rites, however, he says, At the interment one reverently lays his form away; at the sacrifices one rever- ently serves his spirit (shen); and by means of inscriptions, eulogies, and gene- alogical records one reverently hands down his name to posterity (xix, Watson, p. 105). This sounds as if ordinary folk are superstitious, and think of the rituals as a serving of the kuei (kuei shihf), while the sophisticated gentleman speaks of serving (or worshipping, or acknowledging) the shen of the departed (shih sheng) as part of the true tao of man. (That common folk would also acknowl- edge shen is, of course, true but unimportant here.) We have a problem, however. In the funeral rites, it is part of man's tao to serve the shen, but it is superstition to think one is serving kuei. In the case of sacrifices for rain, it is superstition to think one is serving shen, for the gentle- man knows such rites are rather a matter of wenh, or humane culture. What is one to make of this?</page><page sequence="8">450 Machle It might be answered: the essay on ritual was written earlier than the one on Heaven, and the author's thought developed in the interim. From viewing only kuei-rituals as superstitious, he moved to viewing all reference to spirits as superstitious. This could be a solution, right enough, but a purely fiat one. There seems to be no way whatever to establish which essay was written first. Regarding the dates of composition, about all we can say is that the somewhat pejorative reference to the king of Ch'u in the essay on Heaven was probably written while Hsiin Ch'ing was not a resident of Ch'u. That indicates nothing of the relative priority of the essays. In the absence of a firm chronology of Hsiin Tzu's writings, theories about his intellectual development can only be projections of our own assumptions. Verbal solutions do not help, either, such as the suggestion that the word "shen," in the one case, excludes kuei, while in the other case, includes them. This is undoubtedly so, but unless shen in Essay xvii includes only kuei, which is most unlikely, nothing is solved. Likewise, nothing can be made out of the point that in one case the contrast is between serving kuei and serving shen, in the other, between a supernaturalist attitude and a humanist attitude. That merely restates the problem, no more. The most promising resolution would seem to be this. Funeral rituals deal with the alteration of a close personal relationship, already defined within the rules of propriety. For whatever analogy there may be between one's relation to a loved-one living and the same loved-one dead, there is also a profound difference. Hsiin Tzu's whole approach calls attention to the passing from one to the other. The relation to the living is defined by the hsiao' of family life, that to the dead, in terms of honoring and reporting to the shen of one's ancestor, presenting him no more in the flesh, but as resident in the ancestral tablet. Truly humane living requires not only that this transition be lived through, but that it be lived through expressively. The psychology of such living-through can be described, and Hsiin essays do that. But effectively to produce the described results, the ritual, and its ritual references, must be believed in. Otherwise, one cannot be sincere about the whole transaction, and for Hsiin, as for any Confucian, sincerity is fundamental. In the case of prayers for rain, or other rituals directed toward nature, there is no such alteration of the relationship involved. The relation of man to Heaven is constant. Hsiin Tzu takes for granted that this constancy can be expressed and celebrated in ritual ways. He never criticizes the imperial rites addressed to Heaven and the royal ancestors, or the feudal nobles' sacrifices to the gods of the soil. Prayers for rain, however, are another thing altogether: particular desires and aims intrude into that relationship. This would constitute an imposition upon the powers of nature, an attempt by man to interfere in what belongs to Heaven. Man's place in dealing with drought, Hsiin Tzu makes clear, is so to administer his own affairs that he has sustenance enough no matter what Heaven in its mysterious ways sends down.</page><page sequence="9">451 This also has its reverse side. For coping with drought, there are appropriate administrative technologies, and it is the task of the educated official to acquaint himself with those and to develop sound judgment in applying them. To do anything less is to violate the tao of man, seeking shortcuts that do not fulfill the pattern of li. It is this pattern of li which constitutes the highest possibility of man's relation to the cosmos, the achievement of a harmonious triad with Heaven and Earth. To depart from it is to regress, to violate it is to cause confusion, to substitute private or local ends for it is obscene. The outcome is, then, that serving the spirit of the dead has a humane function-it embodies the cosmic li in the particular human life. Its ultimate ritual function is to bring the fact of a particular death into the cosmic whole- ness. As such, it is a part of wen: whatever else it may do is irrelevant. Hence it can be done with that wholehearted seriousness called chingj ("reverence"). Prayers for rain cannot be so done, for they are, as it were, prayers against wholeness. They refuse to accept the drought Heaven has sent. Hsiin Tzu mentions three times those who are "resentful of Heaven," and in Essay iv says, "He who understands himself is not resentful of men; he who under- stands the decrees (mingk) is not resentful of Heaven." Lack of rain is not something that lies with man, only with Heaven; he who cannot accept it does not really understand the decrees. This is a mark of the "petty man," the man who is lacking in proper intention. In saying this, have we done more than to apply to Hsiin Ch'ing's scene Malinowski's distinction between magic and religion? The noted anthropologist writes, This difference will serve us as a prima facie distinction between magic and religion. While in the magical act the underlying idea and aim is always clear, straightforward, and definite, in the religious ceremony there is not purpose directed toward a subsequent event... The native can always state the end of the magical rite, but he will say of the religious ceremony that it is done because such is the usage, or because it has been ordained, or he will narrate an explanatory myth.10 The common people "hope to accomplish something," for they see sacrifices as magic. The gentleman claims no specific efficacy for them, they are just "humane culture," a part of li or proper rituals. Although Hsiin discusses in Essay xix the "historical antecedents" (li chih so ch'i') of li, their three roots, and their general functionings, he insists that their significance is cosmic, their meaning deep, great, and lofty, and only the Sage can understand them- language surely closer to religious myth than to secular explanation. The opposition he maintains, then, is not one between sacrifices to kuei and those to shen, but between sacrifices directed toward particular ends (which Malinowski would call "magic"), and those which are simply part of the profound expressive whole he calls li, which is for him not merely the pattern of elegant behavior, but the ground of human organization and happi- ness and the key to man's place in the cosmos.</page><page sequence="10">452 Machle So much for the problem of sacrifice. What else does Hsiin Tzu say about spirits? Some of his uses of shen are of little concern to us here. Two of these are quotations from the Odes; one is a textual error, long corrected by Chinese commentators. Two instances merely refer to psychic functions: When man's body develops and his spirit (shen) is produced, then love and hate, delight and anger, sorrow and joy find lodging in him (xvii, Watson, 80) A drunken man will try to leap a ditch a hundred paces wide as though it were a narrow gutter, or will stoop to enter a city gate as though it were a low doorway. This is because wine has disordered his spirit (shen) (xxi, Watson, 134) Similarly, oblique to our study are most cases wherein shen orju shenm ("like a god") is used as a figure of speech, as in The people esteem him as a god, exalt him as Heaven, love him as parents, are in awe of him as of the manifestation of a spirit. People are converted to Tao as though by a shen. Make your speech precious, make it rare, make it laudatory, make it shen. Possibly also oblique are those few instances in Essay xv wherein shen indicates charisma that demands respect: "Therefore it is his shen that commands respect for (or in?) his soldiers," and "Where he is present, he commands a godlike respect." This second passage, however, is of some special interest, since the identical wording occurs within a very different context in Mencius 7A 13. There Legge translates it "Wherever he abides, his influence is of a spiritual nature," while Lau renders it (he) "works wonders where he abides." 1 The two contexts are too similar to demand differing translations-except that one is in Mencius and the other in Hsiin tzu. Among the remaining occasions of shen, however, there are some that are revealing, though not definitive: There is no greater godliness (shen) than to transform yourself with the Way. (i, Watson 16) There is nothing more godlike (shen) than to learn to love one thing alone. (ii, Watson, 26ff.) The life of a man of perfect sincerity is godlike (shen) (xiv). With sincere mind preserve jen, and it will become outwardly evident; out- wardly evident, it will become a spiritual power (shen); being a spiritual power, it will have the ability to transform (iii). These suggest Hsiin Tzu had his own sense of spirituality, one quite typically Confucian, stressing the possibilities of going even beyondjen" to a transformed and transforming unity of some sort. Language about transformations and unities is seductive, and one ought to maintain a suitable diffidence toward giving it a specific content. Here we note its occurrence, and look further for more definitional statements. Luckily, Hsiin twice approaches definitions of shen. In one we read, The stars in their course make their rounds, the sun and moon shine in their turns .... and the myriad things properly receive each its own nourishment so</page><page sequence="11">453 as to reach maturity. We see the efficacy of the entire process while not seeing its actual workings, and so we call it shen. Everyone knows the final outcomes, but no one knows the formless antecedents, and so we call it Heaven. (xvii. Cf. Watson, 80) Hsiin Tzu's phrase here, chih wei?, is his usual definitional one. He is not saying, as I read him, "Folks don't know what it is, so they read a ghost into nature" -though many interpreters, especially the Marxist ones, take him to do so. When he says chih wei he is ordinarily giving a definition; he is presenting a usage he himself owns to. He is saying, in effect, "Nature is properly called spiritual, since, though we see the effects, we don't see the workings; it is properly called Heaven, since, though we know the outcomes, we can't know the invisible causes." This is as close to a definition of "spirit" as a cosmic category as we can find. In the other definitional statement, he is discussing rather the make-up of man, but of that perfectly developed man, the sage or "holy man" (shengjenq). Of him he says, This Tao of his proceeds from his unity. What do we mean by unity? The answer is: laying hold on shen, to be firmly established. What do we mean by shen? Exhausting goodness and cherishing orderliness is to be called shen. To be perfectly established is for there to be no thing in the world sufficient to subvert one. To be shen and firmly established is to be a sage (viii).12 We may have here the outlines of Hsiin Tzu's view of spirituality. The first quasi-definition given above indicates that, in his eyes, spirit in the natural world is characterized by: 1. invisibility in its source or prime workings but productiveness of visible results. 2. the inclusion in these results of remarkable but orderly transformations into higher states of fulfillment. So far, these characteristics would not go beyond his use of shen to mean man's biological life; they do not seem to limit him to merely that. The second quasi-definition, dealing with spirit in human affairs, adds these further traits: 3. the power to transform morally both individuals and whole populations. 4. a character exhausting all goodness and supportive of true orderliness. and associates closely with the idea of shen still another: 5. the presence of an ongoing unity that cannot be subverted by things. It is apparently in reference to the first of these "definitions" that Chan says of Hsiin, "What he called spirit is but cosmic change and evolution"; it is in reference to the second that Watson speaks of his making shen "a quality of moral excellence."13 In what they affirm, these statements are true enough, but both carry a privative element, the first, explicitly and the second, implicitly. Hsiin surely does call "cosmic change and evolution" shen, but clearly does</page><page sequence="12">454 Machle not limit shen to that. He does make shen "a quality of moral experience," but how this relates to religious sensibilities is not readily apparent. Nor, for that matter, is it quickly settled that his "cosmic change and evolution" is devoid of more-than-secular or more-than-moral significance. An interesting conclusion follows when we set the preceding five character- istics associated with shen alongside other general aspects of Hsiin's thought. For him, evil consists in disorder, and the primal flaw in man lies in his suscep- tibility to being turned toward disorder by things, as objects of desire or aversion. Since this flaw is characteristic of man by nature-but it is typical of the man who lays hold on shen that there is no thing that can subvert him-shen must be, in human affairs, the contrary to hsingP, or human nature. Since shen is in this sense contrary to nature, superior to it, and supervenient upon it, it would not be unjustifiable to call it "supernatural," even though it is not set over against Nature (in another sense). This possibility is in itself a challenge to much current interpretation of Hsiin's whole system of thought. v As indicated, shen is often associated with the figure of the Sage. The Sage receives many characterizations in the Hsiin tzu, and we can only summarize here. He is one who perfectly follows tao and who is wholly beautiful doing so (xviii); he has complete mastery of all moral principles (xxi); he is altogether skilled in li (xxxvi); his emotions are at rest in li (ii); he is the acme of the Tao (xix); his thoughts are joyous (xxi); he transforms his own human nature (xxiii); he attains equality with Heaven (xxv). He transforms whole populations, but could not do this if he did not embody the ch'engr ("sincerity") which Heaven and earth exhibit (iii, possibly not authentic). A full paragraph in Essay viii eulogizes him. One striking characteristic which appears again and again is that of unity. It is not just that he has the ability to unify a people; this ability is but the outer aspect of his unique inner unity. He is never of two minds (xxi), but more than that, he has a distinctive goodness which is a single whole. He has unified his loves (i); he cannot be fooled, for he finds in himself the true standard (v); in his self-cultivation he completes the efficacy of Heaven (xvii). His unity seems intimately related to the ultimate artistic unity, for When form and meaning, and emotion and practical use, are treated as the inside and outside or the front and back of a single reality and are both looked after, then rites have reached the middle state ... He who dwells in (this state), who wanders widely and masters all its corners and gradations, is a sage... his enlightenment is the mastery of ritual (xix, Watson, 96). Some of the passages relating to the Sage and his unity are more obscure. In Essay xxv, Malmquist translates as follows: The thoughts will then become refined: this is the flowering of one's purpose. If one cares for it well and unifies it, one's spirit will thereby become accom-</page><page sequence="13">455 plished. When the essence (of one's thought) and the spirit blend one with another, when they become unified and inseparable, one will have become a sage.14 The passage certainly presents difficulties, and one may, with all due respect for Malmquist's expertise, doubt if he has really succeeded in making sense of it. It does at least affirm that Sagehood is achieved by a unity of "spirit" (shen) and "essence" (chingS), whatever that is. (The same word is also translated "refined" in the first line. I suspect that it should be read in light of its use in the "Nei Yeh" book of the Kuan tzu, where it means "the essence of things that gives them life.")15 In light of the difficulties of the passage, too much may not be made of any one reading of it. Let us therefore go on. In Essay xix we find a passage translated by Watson as follows: Only when nature and conscious activity combine does a true sage emerge and perform the task of unifying the world (xix, Watson, 102ff.). When we compare this with Dubs' translation it becomes apparent that the text hardly requires Watson's reading. Dubs has When original nature and acquired characteristics unite in character-develop- ment, then only the name of Sage becomes inseparable from that man: and therefor the benefit of the whole empire comes to him (Dubs, pp. 234f.). Chai translates along the same vein,16 but Hughes has It is not until there is the harmony of nature and the acquired that the terms 'sage' and 'man' become one, for this is the way in which the virtue of the Great Society is completed. ("The Great Society" is Hughes' rendering of t'ien hsiat, "world" or "empire").17 The issue is partly one of punctuation. The standard Wang text gives no punctuation within the passage; Liang punctuates before yiu ("one" or "unify")18, the Harvard-Yenching text after it,19 indicating no firm tradition in the matter. We suggest the following reading, Once nature and what may be acquired come into accord, thereafter "One" is the proper term for the complete Sage-man, and it is from him that the ability of the (social) world to operate effectively derives. It does not seem inappropriate to consider this a wry Confucian caricature of the Taoist view of Lao tzu 42: "Tao gives rise to 'one', 'One' gives rise to 'Two'," as if Hsiin is saying, "The Confucian Tao gives rise to 'One', the Sage, and the Sage divides, makes distinctions, and makes human life in society possible." Yet another such passage deserves attention. In Essay ix, we find a passage on which Watson remarks that it "is couched in highly mysterious language, and the translation ... is tentative".20 He offers, His understanding is of godlike clarity (shen mingV)21 and breadth, and yet</page><page sequence="14">456 Machle of the finest simplicity. Therefore it is said, he whose every move is founded on unity is a sage. (ix, Watson, 47). Duyvendak would have it, Although his intelligence is wise and just, yet he is very simple. Hence it is said: By one principle he unifies the whole. The man who acts in this way is called a Sage.22 Hughes, however, translates the last two sentences, The upshot is the One communicating oneness (i.e., unity) and so being A MAN. That is what I mean by a sage-man.23 The first two words, ku yuehw, may mean "thus it is said" or, following the Mohist logicians, "hence I affirm." The last four words are no problem: wei chih sheng jenx is simply Hsiin's usual definitional formula applied to the word "sage": "this is what 'sage' properly means." As for the rest, yi yu yi shih weijen cheY, Hughes is certainly closest to a word-for-word rendition, for better or for Worse. I believe it justifiable to translate it: On these grounds I affirm: he is the One who bestows unity. He it is who truly acts as Man. This is what 'sage' properly means. To "truly act as Man" may go slightly beyond the text, but hardly. It suggests something Hsin mentions several times, man being an equal copartner with Heaven and Earth, the ideal of Confucian religion. The deepest problem of native Chinese religion may be stated as follows: given the ultimacy of nature (which includes ancestral spirits), wherein does the key to unity therewith lie in human life? So far we have found Hsiin Tzu's answer to be a denial of localized or piecemeal sacredness, such as superstitious attempts to control rainfall, coupled with an apparent affirmation of wholeness or unity, expressed in the Sage's character and in the li, which both spring from that character and lead to it. It is as if even the sacrificing to one's ancestors owes its sacredness to its participation in li, the ordering and unifying structures that find their source in the Sage's own unique unity, the one locus in the whole cosmos wherein nature and moral perfection coincide. VI So far, he who denies a religious motif to Hsiin Tzu could still agree. Watson says of the philosopher's definition of human spirituality that it makes of shen "a quality of moral excellence,"24 just as Fung Yu-lan says Hsiin Tzu "never rises above the merely moral."25 The unity of nature and high culture, at least in the Chinese milieu, could be religious only if nature, that is, 'Heaven', retains the transcendent dimensions it shows, in different ways, in Confucius, Mencius, the Chung Yung, Mo Ti, and the Taoists. Our thesis cannot be maintained if nature is as desacralized in the Hsiin tzu as the received inter-</page><page sequence="15">457 pretations claim. We can here only outline an argument to show that he may well have had more "natural piety" than he has been credited with. Hsin Tzu rejects "knowing Heaven" as a proper desire or pursuit of man, except for that "knowing" which consists in developing human potentialities to their fullest. He nowhere gives any clear enunciation of his view of Heaven; even his essay entitled "A Discussion of Heaven" turns out to be an extended exposition of the importance of distinguishing between Heaven's ways and man's ways and of largely excluding the former from our concern. I find it ironic that his resolute refusal to present a theology of Heaven has been turned by interpreters into a full-fledged antitheology. Thus Chinese philosophers on the mainland affirm that Hsiin Tzu's 'Heaven' "has no will nor conscious- ness,"26 two denials I have been completely unable to find in his works. Rather than make the futile move of arguing from what he does not say, let us note some aspects of his actual talk. In the first place, the received inter- pretation must treat many of his comments as rhetorical flourish. Consider the following: 1. ... rites serve Heaven above and earth below (xix, Watson, 91). 2. The Son of Heaven alone performs the suburban sacrifice to Heaven.... In this way rites distinguish and make clear that the exalted should serve the exalted... (xix, Watson, 91). 3. The very existence of Heaven and earth exemplifies the principle of the higher and lower... (ix, Watson, 36). 4. The drum is surely the lord of music, is it not? Hence, it resembles Heaven" (xx, Watson, 118). 5. The fate of a man lies with Heaven; the fate of the nation lies in ritual (twice: xvi and xvii, Watson, 86). and perhaps 6. The Kings have Heaven for their first ancestor (xix, Dubs, 220, but confer, the different interpretation in Watson, 91)27 It is significant that every one of these occurs in a context speaking of ritual, and it is here that Hsiin Tzu's heart lies. In fact he claims, How can li not be considered wonderful! Through it Heaven and earth join in harmony, the sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed in order, the stars and constellations march, the rivers flow, and all natural things flourish (xix). The perfection of the cosmic li has its moral dimension, since it is reflected, in a distinctive human way, in the superior man, for Heaven has its constant way, earth has its constant dimensions, the gentleman has his constant deportment. The gentleman follows what is constant... (xvii, Watson, 82). That Heaven supplies a model for men to follow seems quite obvious to Hsuin Tzu, as could be shown from other passages.</page><page sequence="16">458 Machle Loci such as the preceding are frequently discounted, probably on the basis of the following: Heaven's way,of acting has consistency. It did not act as Yao's security nor as Chieh's destruction. If you encourage agriculture and are frugal, Heaven cannot make you poor ..... if you follow Tao and are not of two minds, Heaven cannot send you misfortune.... but it you neglect agriculture and spend lavishly, Heaven cannot make you rich... (xvii) (confer, Watson, 79). and again, Are order and disorder from Heaven? I reply, the sun, moon, stars, planets and other heavenly auspices were the same under both Yu and Chieh. Yii produced order and Chieh chaos. Order and chaos are not from Heaven (xvii) (confer, Watson, 82). The latter does not conflict at all with Jesus' remark that God sends his rain upon the just and the unjust, but the former states Heaven's inability to perform its traditional rewarding and punishing role. It is this assertion of inability which seems to underlie the widespread belief that Hsiin Tzu completely de- anthropomorphized Heaven. Surely a purely blind, impersonal and amoral "heaven" would function as he describes. But so would a thoroughly moral but transcendent Heaven, so long as its tao or li did not include the function of rewarding and punishing. In the latter case, Heaven's "inability" to reward or to punish would be its unwillingness to overstep the bounds of its proper tao. That this is not a fantastic interpretation can be shown through another passage. In Essay xxiii, we find: Why is it, then, that everyone is not able to accumulate good acts in the same way? I would reply: everyone is capable of doing so (ko yiZ), but not everyone can be made to do so (ko shihaa). The petty man is capable (ko yi) of becoming a gentleman, yet he is not willing (k'enab) to do so; the gentleman is capable (ko yi) of becoming a petty man but he is not willing to do so.... Hence, it is correct to say that the man in the street is capable (ko yi) of becoming a Yu but it is not necessarily correct to say that he will in fact find it possible (nengac) to do so. But although he does not find it possible (neng) to do so, that does not prove that he is incapable (ko yi) of doing so (xxiii, Watson, 167, parentheses are my additions). Hsiin Tzu here distinguishes two kinds of impossibility: the abstract impossi- bility of incapability and the concrete impossibility of being unable to bring oneself to choose what he is abstractly perfectly capable of doing. Thus the gentleman cannot become a petty man, no matter how capable he is of doing it; his moral character simply does not permit him to do so. One cannot simply take this distinction neatly and transfer it to the essay on Heaven. It can be argued, however, that it does show two things: (1) we cannot treat "Heaven cannot make you poor," as if there is no ambiguity regarding the precise force of the "cannot," and (2) when Hsiin needed to distinguish "will never take the occasion to do x" from "does not have the</page><page sequence="17">459 capability of doing x," he used neng (or its negation, pu nengad), for the former and ko yi (or pu ko yiae) for the latter. When we look at the passage ascribing to Heaven the inability to reward and punish, we find he usespu neng exclusively. This at least allows the reading that this inability is not a matter of abstract incapacity but a consistent pattern of responding to situations. The gentleman will not consent to becoming a petty man; Heaven will not consent to using flood and drought, heat and cold, as punishments. Such things arrive, but they are not special acts of Heaven directed to special ends; they are Heaven steadily following out its own ritual, its li, its tao. This coheres perfectly with Hsiin Tzu's insistence that the crucial problem is not Heaven's action but men's responses-but the proper response to ritual action is a ritual response. Hsiin Tzu includes all proper responses to Heaven's action under his rubric of li, which is surely better translated ritual than by any other one term. A ritual response to natural initiative is surely in some proper sense religious. This interpretation seems to me eminently consistent not only with his rejection of looking on rituals as ways of obtaining local and particular benefits, but also with the central Confucian belief in what Munro calls "model emula- tion." In the ideal state, men are moved not by hope of reward or fear of punishment but by the attractive example of the perfect Sage-king. As Hsiin Tzu argues elsewhere, men are moved toward the goodness they know they themselves lack. How could such a sagely leader be an equal of and copartner with Heaven and Earth unless they, too, operated on the basis of the unity, beauty, and profundity of li rather than on the basis of reward and punishment? In sum, then, I have argued that the widespread treatment of Hsin Tzu as a nonreligious, even antireligious, philosopher is based in part on the biases of Neo-Confucianism and of twentieth-century Westernizers, in part on his rejection of superstition, and in part on his appearance of demythologizing Heaven. I have presented grounds for not extending his denial of kuei-worship to shen, for taking his interpretation of shen to be something more than mere naturalism, and for rejecting the interpretation of passages attributing inability to Heaven as denials of Heaven's moral supremacy or religious significance. The picture that emerges is one of a Hsiin Ch'ing who is trying to protect the religious substance of Confucianism from dangers on many sides: from the superstitious who seek to use rituals to obtain special favors or to escape the results of their own foolishness, from Mohists who appeal to heavenly reward and retribution to correct social ills, from Taoists who would downgrade or abolish all li as artificial and unresponsive to Nature and substitute disciplines of self-culture which would contribute nothing to high culture and would turn statecraft over to the Legalists; and indeed from followers of Mencius who rely so much on natural processes to produce moral goods that they threaten the Confucian discipline itself. From his concern for both the consistency of Heaven and the consistency</page><page sequence="18">460 Machle of his own thought, and for the joint primacy of li on the one hand and human effort on the other, he was led to deny that the continuity between Heaven and human sanctity lay in the natural processes of production, a principle held both by Mencius and the Taoists. Those who could relate men to Heaven only through such a continuity were constrained to find him irreligious. It would be more fruitful to discern his own sense of the sanctities of men and Heaven, and his own principle of their continuity through ii. This article is intended to be a step in that direction.
