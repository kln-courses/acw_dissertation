<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTIANITY AND THE WAR By NATHAN HASKELL DOLE The Archbishop of Canterbury is reported as having recently recommended to the women of England simultaneously and with one accord to pray to God to put an end to the war. This reminds one of the famous experiment once proposed, whereby at a particular mo ment' everybody was to help in a shout which should be heard around the world. The Archbishop either believes that his recommendation would be efficacious or else he is indulging in a piece of portentous foolishness. He does not seem to see that if he is sincere in such a belief he implicitly holds God to be responsible for the war. If God, at the instance of a given number of women on their knees, could be persuaded to end it, we are freed from any prejudice that might exist in our minds against the Serbians or Austria or Germany or England or Eussia. Kaiser Wilhelm and Edward Grey are equally absolved, and those that hold these puppets up to execra tion may as well save their breath for blowing out the stars. The attitude of the clergy almost universally has been equally unphilosophical, not to say irreligious. Priests and ministers have been known to preach the gospel of hatred from their pulpits. Not long ago I had the privi lege of dining with three distinguished priests of the Protestant Episcopal Church, or, as they were extreme ritualists, they preferred to call it the Catholic Church. One of them was an Englishman, well known for his brilliant writings. All three agreed in all solemnity that it was the duty of this country immediately to take sides with the Allies and put forth all our power to help crush Germany, for which they had no words severe enough to express their execration. I said to them: "Is it not a strange thing that I, who do not pretend to be anything but a more or less enlight ened pagan, should utterly reprobate your teachings? For almost two thousand years the Lords of Misrule, servants of the cGod of Battles/ have had it their own way; have sowed dragon's teeth and raised damnable harvests of warriors; and the present war is the last and #niost perfect outcome of their regime. Would it not better become you preachers of the Gospel of the Prince of Peace to throw the whole weight of your influence on the side of non-resistance than to urge immense arma ments for this country, which, even as it is, spends 70 per cent of our immense revenues in keeping the pistol in the pocket, the bowie-knife in the belt, and the chip on the shoulder? So far in history the advocates of pre paredness have had it their own way. Why not try your own gospel for three years or for ten ?"</page><page sequence="2">268 ADVOCATE OF PEACE October course, pouring in cataracts of living fire, and heading for the town of Hilo, 28 miles away. An xlmerican missionary gathered his little congregation of new and old believers and offered panic-shaken supplications to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that the approach ing doom might be turned from their homes. On it came. Then a little Kanaka princess, reverting to the religion of her ancestors, took a living pig, which had been a favorite tidbit in the epicurean palate of their all powerful god, Pele, and with appropriate prayers in the melodious language offered it up. The supplication was heard! The river of fire swerved away and Hilo was saved. It was the old contest of Elijah and the Priests of Baal?reversed. What effect this miracle had on the gentle sons and daughters of Hawaii and what insidious skepticism it aroused in the missionary flock is well known to all acquainted with the history of our island territory. This summer I put the case of the Archbishop of Can terbury before three college presidents, all of the orthodox fold. One said the trouble with the archbishop was that he still had an anthropomorphic conception of God. Both the others shook their heads and declined to defend him. Indeed, what reasonable being could ? What rea sonable being can deny that Christianity has utterly broken down in this supreme test ? In all these cen turies certain plain teachings have been at least once a week read in all solemnity before millions of people, and countless sermons have elucidated the doctrines which have passed current as Christian. The Ten Command ments of the Hebrews have been accepted, and their summing up in two, inculcating the Golden Bule and worship of a God whose other name was Love, have been recommended as mandatory. Yet millions of Christians, yet all the countries priding themselves on the title of Christian, have professed war as their ideal human conduct at its highest efflorescence. The shortest of the commandments says, "Thou shalt not kill," and all the congregations murmur, "Oh Lord, incline our hearts to keep this law." Yet war's chief object is to break this law. Under the stress of war, all the vices become virtues, and there enters into men's souls an un holy joy in crime. On the twenty-second of August last the Crown Prince of Germany concluded an order for celebrating the anniversary of the battle of Longwy with an expression of dissatisfaction with the war conditions: "We wait with undiminished joy the day of battle when the Emperor summons us to a new attack! ... Into the war that we love!" Now it is generally known that Friedrich-Wilhelm is a nice, pious young man! And what he loves is to stay safely in the rear, out of all danger from shrapnel and asphyxiating gases, and to send thousands of pleasant faced, gem?tlich young Germans out into a hailstorm of bullets and bursting shells, to be torn into pieces of hor rible bleeding flesh and shattered bones, and to compel them, or the remainder of them, to dash with sharp bayonets against equally pleasant-faced and naturally friendly Frenchmen and Englishmen, who have not the gleam of an idea what they are fighting for or feel any natural dislike for their opponents, and who, if left alone, mingle with their opponents and exchange tobacco and greetings, except when forbidden to do so under pain of punishment. All the other commandments are dislocated in war Their only answer was that it might do for the indi vidual to turn the other cheek, but never for the nation. Those that argue that war is a divine institution, de signed to keep up human stamina, to prevent men from degenerating into jelly-like simulacra of men, use the same arguments as were used a century ago in favor of dueling. Dueling served to keep men brave, to protect the honor of women, and to purify politics. It was a divine institution and could never be done away with. Arguments for its maintenance as a wholesome system were found in the Scriptures. The death of Hamilton woke a wiser spirit. The absurdity of a code which left the settlement of a delicate moral question not to justice, but to the greater coolness or skill of a self-appointed arbiter, was suddenly borne in upon the consciousness of a whole nation, and dueling died with Aaron Burr's death-dealing bullet. The Armageddon War, which the whole world de plores, will not be wholly wasted if it arouses mankind to a realization of the utter folly of war; otherwise it will reaffirm Bernhardts cynical old doctrine that might makes right. We all know that that is the most cojossal lie of history. Christianity might and should have prevented the appeal to force. Unfortunately there is no such thing as Christianity. Enlightened readers of the gospels know that there were two Christs; they have been called the Northern and the Southern. One loaded scribes and Pharisees with invectives; scourged from the temple the money-changers, those that passed the contribution box, or helped the would-be contributors, and was in a way the ideal of the church militant. The other was meek and mild, forgave those that maltreated him, and loved his enemies. One came to bring, not peace, but a sword; the other was ready to die rather than lift his hand to smite. The confusion in men's minds regarding the teachings of Jesus arises from this double Christ. Hence we see the Germans hymning songs of hate, printing "Gott straffe England" on their bread, to eat it as cannibals eat the hearts of their foes, to keep the fire of courage hot in their veins. With equal confidence the Kaiser and Tsar appeal to the Father of their Christ to help their respective causes and cannot see the infinite ludi crousness of it. One would think that such a terrific cataclysm would have shaken the very foundations of religion. As well might some little animalcule in the blood of a fever patient, suffering from abnormal temperature, put up its little hands and pray to the Unknown God, in whose being it exists, to save it from the agony of burning up. Maybe a good dose of niter or several grains of quinine will abate the fever, and this, following immediately after the prayer offered by the animalcule, will cause it to re joice in its providential relief. The king of the animal cules or their archbishop may issue a proclamation call ing for a great service of praise and thanksgiving for the wonderful kindness of their God. Any skeptic who should dare to question cause and effect would be perse cuted. Human beings are prone to confuse the post hoc with the propter hoc. A good many years ago there was a tremendous erup tion of the volcano of Kilauea on the island of Hawaii.

All ideals of honor are subverted. For beauty in life, in conduct, in art, in architecture, are substituted monstrosities of ugli ness. Womanhood, motherhood, becomes a plaything for lust. Courage ? Yes, the courage of desperation. The sol dier who engages in a charge sees only red?the color of blood. There are individual instances of heroism in bearing untold agonies. Doubtless, but for what useful purpose? Suppose the wrong side conquers; suppose wrong conquers ? When peace is at last restored, in what respect will the common people of any of the countries involved be benefited ? Will they be any freer, any richer, any hap pier? Not long ago Colonel Eoosevelt asked me what I thought of China as a despicable people, lying prostrate because unarmed. The answer is, of course, that the common people of China are just as happy and probably much happier than if they were enrolled in an enormous army with corresponding taxes. The advocate of preparedness for this country is not thinking of the common people; he is thinking of the few multimillionaires who might possibly run some risk of pecuniary loss if Germany should land 250,000 men? it is always 250,000 men?on our shores and seize New York and demand a war indemnity. But if we were an unarmed people, what would Germany come over here for? Germany, with all its faults, is not a freebooter nation. The day of the buccaneer has past. We have always welcomed the Germans and taken them in as our most worthy fellow-citizens. Our only danger lies not in unpreparedness, but in preparedness. A nation is only a human being raised to the Nth power. Many un necessary wars have come about through the blunder of personification, calling a hive of men She! Now the gospel of the gentle Christ recommends un preparedness. We have learned that much in its appli cation to our individual circumstances. Nowhere except in barbarous, uncivilized communities, as, for instance, in the mountains of the South and in Mexico, do we settle our private quarrels by swords and rifles. We have pretty much done away even with fences. In many cities you will see whole streets with a continuous lawn; and to. carry concealed weapons is a misdemeanor. That is the essence of Christianity. I know a man who was not long ago sent to a mine in Mexico. His predecessors had gone about in the dime-novel style, armed to the teeth, and they had invariably got into disputes with the rough men under them. This man refused all such paraphernalia of cowardice. He went down into his mine and mingled with two hundred or more of the roughest specimens that Mexico could furnish. He met them in a friendly spirit, but he was unarmed, and they knew it, and he was never even threatened. His men would have protected him. Afterward he went to Africa and in the same way among a cannibal tribe he never hesitated to turn his back upon any man or crowd of men among them. Perhaps he was a Parsifal?but Parsifal was the Wise Fool of the Scriptures. ISTo, the real cowards, the real menaces to the peace of the United States, are the preachers of preparedness. It is our duty, say the Hearst headlines, to prepare for war. Such expressions of cowardice are irreligious, unchris tian. Christianity is only the other name for the highest wisdom. If this is not so, let us cease calling ourselves a Christian nation; let us stop reading the Testament; let us turn the churches into arsenals; let us build a wall of solid steel along all our borders and educate all our young men to kill. That is what Christianity, so far, has done. Even the pacifist, a little ashamed of the name, is now accenting the word on the last syllable and denying his Master like a new Peter, expecting every moment to see the red cock of hostile arson perching on the Capitol at Washington.</page></plain_text>
