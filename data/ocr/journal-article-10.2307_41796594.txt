How has race erupted into formalist issues of whiteness within modernist art practice, disturbing categories of disinterested aesthetic appreciation? As Manthia Diawara shows in his essay on the appropriation of classic Hollywood film noir by black American film- makers of the 1980s, the use of chiaroscuro is far from ideologically neutral. Extrapolating from several decades of work by feminist film theorists who have explored the close psychological fit between deadly heroines and darkly lit cinematography, Diawara asserts: uFrom a formalist perspective a film is noir if it puts into play light and dark in order to exhibit a people who become xblack' because of their vshady' moral behavior/'1 Even if a critic may want to back off insisting on strictly coded equivalencies between historic racial repre- sentations and the color of light and form, it seems imperative, particularly in the present era, to confront the aesthetics of whiteness and colorlessness with its disavowed racial unconscious. Diawara interrogates the racial valence of noir in a film genre ostensibly concerned with psychological darkness and the emotional densities of light rather than with scenarios of raced characterology. In so doing he sets an example for blatantly decontextualizing problems of filmic formalism. The implicit justification behind this crossover is that it resets the critical bound- aries of aesthetics and politics: in this case, Diawara complicates the binary racial paradigm of black and white by reconfiguring it as noir and light. Diawara's conjugation of unlike discourses is similar to the strategy I have adopted in attempting a postcolonial critique of site specularity. I am inter- ested specifically in theorizing the relationship between the aestheticized poli- tics of rayonnement (the export of "Enlightenment" ideas and culture to colonial or postcolonial territories) and the subliminally political aesthetics of photogenic landscape. In common parlance the word photogenic refers to that which is "artistically suitable for being photographed, as in a face or figure." By implication, the photogenic subject is automatically understood to be a per- son. But what happens when the subject is not a person but a place, a site or a landscape? Exploring the subject of site photogeneity leads me to ask whether places can be analyzed as photogenic on their own terms, that is, as visual lures that do not depend on anthropomorphic analogies to "giving good face." My deeper concern, however, is to "cast light on the subject," specifically sub- jects of colonial history. Place is often a displacement for a person who has been "disappeared," as in the famous pictures of Egyptian monuments taken in the 1850s by Flaubert's travel companion Maxime du Camp, who systematically deleted local humanity or included a single native figure to give scale to the site. The work of Jean Epstein and Edgar Morin on "photogeny" (photogénie), outlined in Epstein's writings on close-ups and filmic ontology in the 1920s and in Morin's Le Cinéma ou l'homme imaginaire (1958), makes it apparent that the early movie camera - the cinematograph - played a key role in defin- ing the particular photogeny associated with the visual ity of modernity and the colonization of place, both optical and bureaucratic.2 Morin noted that the first cinematographers thrust themselves on the world and became tourists, much like the first colonial settlers. The images delivered by these cine- matographs exerted their fascinating hold on the viewer because of the partic- ular way in which their technology understood photogeny, literally the "genius of the photo" or what Morin referred to as "image charm," in the sense of spell, enchantment, visual seduction. Taking his cue from Epstein, a 1920s avant-garde filmmaker and theorist, Morin saw photogeny as cinema's prise de conscience, the moment when it recognizes its own powers of visual enthrallment. Photogeny emerges as an ethics of visual reflexivity, involving Air- Afrique Advertisement Jean Epstein, film still of Mt. Etna's eruption, La Montagne infidèle, 1923 16.21</page><page sequence="3">the spectator's apperception of the magical realism of quotidian representa- tions, the legendary embedded in the everyday, and his/her own obliquity as subject of representation. Morin distinguished between photographic and cinematic photogeny on the grounds that the latter, in its reliance on a depri- vatized viewing space, enhances the alterity and strangeness of the image. In 1920 the filmmaker Louis Delluc related the term photogénie to the banal beauty exuded by the faces of certain actors on screen. It mattered little whether the light was poor, the cameraman hysterical, the director a sadist, or the scenario abominably stilted: if the actors were photogenic, Delluc argued with barbed irony, any film could be salvaged. Delluc sought to disengage an aesthetically redemptive photogeny from the "monotone quintessence/' visual clichés, and insufficient mastery of "light's algebra" characteristic of an early French cinema overly indebted to photographic stills and postcard images.3 Though Delluc stigmatized facile photogenic beauty, he was nonetheless concerned with safeguarding its seductive powers, concentrated, it appears, in the match between high-modernist design and erotic lighting. In tune with con- temporary apologists for the erotics of modern primitivism (Apollonaire and Picasso among many others), Delluc heralded the sophisticated visual appeal of light on dark skin. He was careful, however, to maintain this aesthetic at a safe distance from what he thought to be the prosaic arena of publicity and commercial image-production characteristic of tourism. Instead of faces that appeared as blank screens "over which feeling played Its tricks/' he pressed for the sculpted, masklike visages set on top of bodies clad in minimally pat- terned clothing, what he called "visual dresses." Delluc's vision of the photo- genic relied upon an aesthetic of classic modernism: ocean liners, airplanes, and railroads were photogenic by virtue of uthe geometry of their structure"; in costume design, black and white uniforms beguiled the eye while transcend- ing the false consciousness of period costume. Extolling the photogenic poten- tial of flesh, Delluc also provided an inadvertent authorization for cinéma colo- nial; celebrating how light played on matte skin tones, he singled out meridional complexions or the sinuous bodies of women of color, as in René Le Somptier and Louis Naipas's orientalist film La Sultane de l'Amour. Some years later Roland Barthes reprised the notion of photogeny. Like Delluc, Barthes focused on the aesthetics of sexual light; unlike Delluc, however, he refused to exclude popular visual culture or soft porn from the realm of photogeny. Relocating the photogene in the photograph, Barthes analyzed how "threadbare visual legends" get turned into "ready cash" in relation to the particular kind of pleasure yielded by Baron von Gloeden's famous photos of Neapolitan ragazzi posing as classical ephebes. The "hot" visual appeal of von Gloeden's pictures resided for Barthes in the "blue-black gaze" - the bruised yet appealing light that showers the sun-darkened bodies of boys. Such visual erotics recall Lacan's notion of the painter's "filigreed gaze," which, in seminar XI, he described as an autographic "play" of "light and opacity" secreted on the canvas.4 In von Gloeden's pictures, as seen by Barthes, the gaze of the photographer appears as an iridescent smudge, con- noting the "sublime blur" of art and sex: "Whereby these little Greek gods (already contradicted by their blackness) have rather dirty peasant hands with big rough fingernails, worn feet that are none too clean, and very visible swollen foreskins - no longer stylized, i.e., tapered and reduced: uncircumcised is what they are, and one sees only that: the baron's photos are at once sublime and anatomical."5 Mark Alloula noted a comparable mark of the gaze in the "tawdriness" associated with soiled bodies and tacky garments of the postcard harem girls collected in his book The Colonial Harem: "This tawdriness that keeps reap- pearing is beyond the control of the postcard," he wrote, "It is its original sin, its mark of infamy, in sum, its signature at the bottom of a counterfeit."6 This racially freighted idea of dirty light and menacing patches of shadow can be extended to the particular photogeny of colonial landscape in film noir. Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930), Jacques Feyder's Le Grand Jeu (1934), Julien Duviver's La Bandera (1935) and Pépé le Moko (1936) (set in Algiers), Michael Curtiz's ever-classic Casablanca (1942), Alfred Hitchcock's postwar version of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1955), and more recently Bernardo Bertolucci's fey adaptation of Paul Bowles's The Sheltering Sky (1990) all capitalize on Morocco's "star quality" - a noirish photogenicity rivaled only perhaps by San Francisco, Berlin, and Hollywood. Shadows, arrayed in complex decorative patterns against bands and wedges of intense light, (von Sternberg's Morocco) or sprayed in dark technicolor blue around a minaret at nightfall (The Man Who Knew Too Much), emerge as a visual specialty of Morocco movies. Modernity revealed Morocco's cities and desert expanses as historic marvels, the visual legend of film. By the early 1930s the film crew had become such a commonplace appearance in the Moroccan landscape that Wyndham Lewis dedicated an entire section of his jaundiced Moroccan travelogue Journey into Barbery to a pastiche of what he called "film-filibusters," industry magnates who "send their troupes (not troops) merely to afford their sham-sheiks a Hispano-Mauresque photo- graphic setting." Stating that these sham-sheiks were nothing better than shadow figures at one material remove from the "thin reality" of the cinematic screen, Lewis inadvertently captured the ghostly atmospherics peculiar to the construction of "Morocco" both as orientalist commodity and as a screen place of memory. More recently, Rachid Boudjedra's 1980 magic-realist novel Les 1001 années de la nostalgie (A Thousand and One Years of Nostalgia) grimly sati- rized the commercial photogeneity of postcolonial landscape. A North African desert town is transformed by the arrival of a foreign film crew equipped with fabulous sets simulating the dream-decors of Sheharazade's tales. The inhabi- tants become exotic extras, unable to recognize themselves, while the once familiar landscape around them is subjected to cosmetic surgery, enhancing the "face" of Islam: the sky bandaged with bluer than blue, the sun covered in cellophane, the old mosques refurbished with counterfeit decoration, and a seascape replete with quais, docks, and sailors implanted in the sand like some worn cliché of a desert mirage. These stagings, morbidly culminating in the use of recently assassinated residents to play cadavers, are realized in the name of the cinematograph, itself described as the benignly demonic agent of a kinder gentler recolonization (une recolonisation en douce).7 The photogene, emerging from a theoretical montage of Delluc, Barthes, and Boudjedra, is an affair of black and light. Consider, for example, the photosensitive way in which the colonial novelist and filmmaker Jean d'Esmé evoked the carbonized landscape, "brutal light," and "black fortifications" of Senegal while on location for his 1938 epic Sentinelles d'Empire: xvSoot-colored land, paved with black stones, flat, calcified, devastated like an incinerated landscape; in the distance, two ^guelbs/ two mountain peaks resembling two enormous blocks of coal and to which the brutal light gives a sinister sheen/farther still, at the flaming horizon, an abrupt black wall over Dakar."8 D'Esmé seems to have been particularly conscious of filming Africa as a brilliantly lit epidermis. Writing about Peaux-noires, a film made during a year of travel through Cameroon, Chad, Oubangi-Chari, the Congo, and Gabon, he claimed to have sought "not to express Africa's soul, but rather, simply, to show her face" (0 105). As the notion of photogeny is transferred from face to place, from flesh to building "skin" or wrinkled desertscape, from racially marked body to film noir, the problem of what gives a site its sex becomes entangled with the more diffi- cult political and aesthetic problem of identifying what is noir in the aesthetics of noir. Put slightly differently, what (or who) is black in the shadows of the high-gloss landscape? These questions are particularly pertinent in relation to some of the more aesthetically sensitive films made in the 1920s and 1930s. Marc Allegret's Le Voyage au Congo (1925-27), for example, capitalized on the "art" value of African bodies. Filmed on-site in the company of his lover and mentor André Gide, (whose bitter exposé of colonial injustice in the Congo earned him the wrath of many literary admirers), the film in hindsight might be seen as a precursor of Leni Riefenstahl's album of aestheticized Nubians or Robert Mapplethorpe's photographic eulogy of black masculinity. Each of these artists depended on a dermographic photogeny that submerged (and obscured) the racial politics of black and white in the high-art aesthetics of black and light.</page><page sequence="4">BipillS iÄSaBÄ^^5':.; ^4.' . :^' v%' sBnPv ''î#:;;flV€H' . *••• ' NI^HhhhHP ■ .ím^I^^^^^WK^MHÍÍIII^BIbbIII^^^^^^^BM Sogno, Maroc-Lyautey, 1930 Fez, city wall, from André Chevrillon, Visions du Maroc, 1933.

" Ã,a~ 16.23</page><page sequence="5">A photogene, appropriately enough, refers to uan impression retained on the retina of the eye after the object itself has vanished, an afterimage/' Most avant-garde and surrealist filmmakers of the 1920s, committed to capturing dream consciousness or the ubiquity of ghosts and phantasms in everyday life, exploited this visual conceit repeatedly. In the context of colonial representa- tion, the psychological photogene acquires historical meaning in a master narrative of European imperialism, technological incursion, intrigue, and espi- onage. Native subjects are noticeable as absences: shadows that glance off the side of a pyramid or mosque, anonymous geometries arranged as infill for the marketplace scene, milky traces of overexposure. Their belated appear- ance concentrates new significance on the psychic and mechanical techniques of afterimaging crucial to the projection of colonial vision. The hegemonic "facescape" of the colonizer in the desert and the scape- goating of native face provide examples of what Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari dubbed visagéité: to designate regimes of "faceness" or face-pro- duction. "Visage-ification" is what gives legibility (and therefore power) to human bodies. Faceness operates semiotically through the system, mur- blanc-trou-noir (white wall, black hole). As the agent of subjectification, face- ness stamps out the terrifying specter of the inhuman (the visage-bunker, or mask of dead white meat).9 For Deleuze and Guattari, the face of power is a colonizing force (one thinks of those futurist canvases in which rays of light irradiate from the giant head of Mussolini, beaming down over Italy), as well as a visual gold standard of Christian racial orthodoxy: uThe face is not a universal ... it is the white man himself, with his large white cheeks and black eyeholes. The face is Christ. ... If the face is Christ, that is to say, the average white man, the first derivations, the first typological swerves (ecarts-types) are racial: yellow man, black man, men of the second and third category. They too are inscribed on the wall, organized around the hole. They must be Christianized, that is to say visage-ified" (MP 216, 218). Deleuze and Guattari argue that racism does not just proceed through the exclusion or othering of strangers but equally through the disturbance created by the other's nonidentity with whiteface. For white Europeans, the "crime" of people of color has traditionally been their possession of visages that are sim- ply not legible as face. Deleuze and Guattari "deterritorialize" the aesthetics of the portrait and the picturesque by revealing its ideological collusion with Christian pedagogy. That is, they show how photogeny's techniques for mesmer- izing the spectator with facescapes can be complicitous with racist visual ity. Though Delluc was certainly blind to the colonial implications of photogenic landscape, his close associate Epstein theorized its significance as an episteme of psychic eruption and territorial breakdown in ways that suggest postcolonial applications. Aerial perspectives, close-ups of shifting landmasses, facescapes of character and place - these linchpins of avant-garde sublimity, however far they may seem from any specific colonial agenda, may be adduced as part of the strutwork supporting imperial vision. In a film entitled Photogénie (1925) that was subsequently destroyed, Epstein translated the technics of visual mastery into a sublime cinematic metaphysic capitalizing on the mesmerizing effects of light, magnification, and scale. Epstein regarded the cinematograph as an instrument of the fourth dimension - a tool that, by "laminating time" (showing time to be subject to technological manipulation), rendered it commensurable with space. Thespatial- ization of temporality was crucial to his aesthetic of photogeny; for Epstein, the photogene was lodged in a cinematic representation that, like virtual reality, seemed to implant the camera's eye within the viewer's body: "When a charac- ter is going to meet another," he wrote, "I want to go along with him not behind or in front of him or by his side, but in him. I would like to look through his eyes and see his hand reach out from under me as if it were my own; interruptions of opaque film would imitate the blinking of our eyelids."10 Epstein's kino-eye, not unlike that of Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein, Salvador Dali, and Luis Buñuel, was most tangible in the close-up, where physical touch joined the visual image in an electric moment of contact: "Close- up, close-up, close-up," he wrote, "Not the recommended points of view, the horizons of the Touring Club, but natural, indigenous, and photogenic details" (E 95). In prose that conjures up Georges Bataille's essay on the big toe, Barthes's discursus on the zoom-lensed face of Greta Garbo, or Lacan's theory of the solicitation of the image, Epstein wrote in 1923: "A close-up of an eye is no longer an eye, it is AN eye: that is to say, the mimetic decor in which, suddenly, the character of the gaze appears" (E 140). Epstein was fascinated by the way in which an inanimate object, say a revolver, could, when enlarged in gros plan, turn into a "personnage-revolver," that is, a "character" capable of signaling suicidal impulses, criminal desire, even remorse. The term for close- up in French, - gros plan - translates literally as "big plan" or "map." For Epstein, the gros plan turned the screen into a relief map squirming with every- day objects coming alive. Stark seascapes or landmasses vertiginously filmed from above became expressive faces; the sky itself turned plastic and morphic when placed under the cinematographic eye, a material to be used in visual con- struction: Epstein wrote that if cathedrals were built in stone and sky, then films could be made from photograph and sky (E 190). Mobile microscopy combined with subliminal telescopy produced a new kind of photogenic landscape - the kinetic fleshland. In the 1922 essay "Langue d'or," Epstein imagined the human face bathed in an electrocuting Le Corbusier, drawing of airplane circling minaret, La Ville Radieuse</page><page sequence="6">shower of light, "cooked, recooked, corroded, cured, brushed, and embossed with the colors of passion" (E 143). The shock produced by the mutant magni- fied detail was comparable to the trauma of a wound or the psychic reaction to seismic upheaval. In the style of futurist prose poetry, splicing human faces with geomorphic contours and eruptions, he communicated the effect of pho- togeny in a psychoanalytical ly familiar language of splitting and cutting: "Muscular preambles ripple beneath the skin. Shadows shift, tremble, hes- itate. Something is being decided. A breeze of emotion underlines the mouth with clouds. The orography of the face vacillates. Seismic shocks begin. Capillary wrinkles try to split the fault. A wave carries them away. Crescendo. A muscle bridles. The lip is laced with tics like a theater curtain. Everything is movement, imbalance, crisis. Crack. The mouth gives way, like a ripe fruit splitting open. As if slit by a scalpel, a keyboardlike smile cuts laterally into the corner of the lips" (E 93). Epstein's metaphor of photogenic eruption materialized in one of his first films, La Montagne infidèle (1923), a documentary recording a volcanic explosion at Mount Etna. In a 1926 lecture based on the film, Epstein cast Mount Etna as an earthwork of sublime terror, a monument of site photogene- ity galvanizing the surrounding Sicilian landscape: XXS icily ! The night was an eye full of the look. In front of us: Etna, giant actor releasing its spectacle two or three times a century, and whose tragic fantasia I had come to film. ... No tragic actor of the theater ever knew a storm of such proportions, the earth suffering, but dominated, crackling with its call . . . Etna, telegraphing the extreme shaking of disaster . . . spreading its deadly post-explosion pall . . . grilled leaves, naked trees, lava spreading like broken plates" (E 131). Seeking, perhaps, to rescue the sublime from the banal by defining it cinematographically (thus founding a new cinematic ontology that would become the basis for postwar film theory from André Bazin to Jean-Luc Godard), Epstein relied nonetheless on a tradition of the aesthetic sublime that calibrated momentous philosophical shifts of ground with images of earth-shaking metastasis. One thinks of Empedocles, the pre-Socratic philoso- pher who died by throwing himself into Etna's inferno to show, in defiance of Socratic wisdom, that instead of exiting the cave, one should plunge in ever farther, thus privileging terrestrial immanence over transcendence. One thinks of Voltaire's interpretation of the Lisbon earthquake in terms of a fundamen- tal questioning of the beneficence of God; of Edmund Burke's préfiguration of the terrifying aesthetic sublime in the Dublin floods of his youth; of Bataille's trip of horror to Mount Etna with his consumptive, fatally masochistic mis- tress Colette Peignot (Bataille wrote, "This ascension of Etna had an extreme significance for us ... we were exhausted, and in some sense, ex-orbed [exor- bités - our eyes dashed from our heads] by a strange, disastrous solitude: it was a moment of rupture in which we were leaning over the gaping wound on the crack of a star where we were breathing . . ."). In a more recent context, one thinks of Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty, in conjunction with some of his art-critical earthworks of the 1960s and writings that conflate intellectual and topographical faultlines: "Oceanic depths in these maps submerge the continents of prose. Equators spill onto shores of misplaced thought. Where do these maps start? No place .... Continental critical drift merges and sinks into different photographic seas. Swamps of 'isms' develop around reproductions of art . . . details of paintings stick out of intellectual lava flows."11 Finally, as someone who experienced the Los Angeles earthquake of 1994, I can't help thinking of the vacuous sublimity of the clips taken by supermar- ket surveillance cameras that were endlessly played on television to illustrate the force of the quake. Like cinematographs dispatched by God to venture where no human eye would dare to go, these surveillance cameras remained vigilantly on location throughout the disaster, recording shaking countertops and toppling grocery shelves, generating new televisual fodder for the emi- nently recyclable myth of moral Apocalypse in the Southlands. If Epstein's sublime photogeny ends the century with this flickering image of a supermarket floor strewn with soap boxes and biscuit containers, never- theless in this surveillance from above the colonial and natural photogene found, and perhaps still finds, its most characteristic form. We might then see the collapsed supermarket shelves or the fleeing shadows of bank robbers as the suburban equivalents of the wasted battlefields of war and nuclear assault (theorized by Paul Virilio), or the terrain of the colonies, subdued and sur- veyed by aerial cartography, as landscapes of photogeny in which disaster, shock, and metaphysical ruin have been visually encrypted. Jean and Jérôme Tharaud, French travel writers of the 1920s and 1930s who produced a stream of popular accounts of historic Moroccan cities, judged the impact of aerial shots so profound that it prompted them to try to compete in prose. Hypnotized by the outlines of distant landmasses, they fig- ured the earth as a field of filigreed shelters covering the unreal. Their chroni- cle of an airplane voyage around the world, Paris-Saigon dans PAzur (1932), begins with a reminiscence of their former teacher, the geographer Vidal de la Blache, promenading his spindly fingers over the map of the globe, fondling the world like a giant fetish: "Long ago, at the Ecole Normale, I was a geography student. I had as my professor the distinguished M. Vidal de la Blache, ingenious at discovering relationships between men and earth. Of the students that he had, I was undoubt- edly one of the weakest, but I was also, I think, the one most sensitive to the intelligent, almost amorous way in which he would run his long thin fingers over a map to make it understood. The whole universe seemed to be held alive in his hand. It seems that from up above, I will see the fingers of the old pro- fessor walking on the world."12 Faithful colonial servants, the Tharauds traversed North Africa at the invi- tation of Maréchal Lyautey (the chief colonial administrator of Morocco), generating copy for the burgeoning French tourist industry as in Algiers to Marrakech by Automobile or books devoted to the historic cities of Fez, Rabat, and Marrakech. Born and raised in the Limousin, near Oradour, a town whose inhabitants were burned alive as the German army retreated during World War II, the Tharauds promoted conservative values through a redemptive vision of the French countryside. A typically French Catholic quest for a new spiritualism is evident in theirjncl ination toward sentimental regionalism, their disciplelike following of the great avatars of the patriotic pastoral (Charles Péguy, Maurice Barrés), and their "arabophilic" fascination with the spiritual grandeur of Islam. Their tender spot for the landscape of a static biblical Orient often creat- ed a conflict of ideological interest: on the one hand, they endorsed the project of empire; on the other, they were chagrined by the scarring of territory caused by industrialization. Surveying Iraq by plane, they expressed horror at what the landscape told them: "'Baghdad!' Of these syllables nothing remains - the fabulous tale has come undone, the Orient fallen into dust, abandoned by the English to the void. ... It is a Baghdad of petrol, xla Bagdad de I'Anglo-persan-oil-Company.'" Bagdad marred the crusade for aerial landscape of geometric epiphany such as those afforded by the cities of Persia: "[D]azzling cliff, miraculously surging out of inconsistent spaces, spreads out into angles, facets, living craters, and its perpetual dazzle, like the display window of a Swedish knife salesman or supernatural jeweler" (PS 79). Equaling Baghdad, for the Tharauds, the Cambodian temple of Ankor-wat was the ne plus ultra of site seduction, the analogue to Versailles in the har- monious order of its parterres. Soaring past it only to swoop down close, they recounted an experience of sublime terror: the looming Cambodian temple was "a cinematograph running toward you from the depth of the screen, grow- ing larger and larger, seeming almost to submerge you, then suddenly distanc- ing itself again, vanishing into phantasmagoria" (PS 197). In this curious description, Ankor-wat is cast as a redoubtable foreign monument masquerad- ing as a movie camera. Surging up in gros plan (literally "in your face"), the camera fixes the airborne viewer in an unnerving reverse gaze; but the passen- ger's fear of being caught on film is soon quelled as the plane veers back on course; the latent imperialism of aerial vision thus reasserts itself over Indochina's greatest architectural treasure. 16.25</page><page sequence="7">In this aeronautic worldscape the Tharauds struggled to dissipate the fear that came of seeing landmarks of a great non-European civilization suddenly rise up. In their travel book on Marrakech, they responded to a similar strug- gle by using narrative leveling techniques. They invented a degree-zero topog- raphy - or, if you will, a kind of eco-absolutism - evacuating human subjects, essentializing culture and space, and distracting the reader from the politics of colonial eminent domain. They evoked North Africa's photosensitive empty spaces to heighten a sense of the civilizing mission as an epic, expansionist project (a stadium for cultural and theological rayonnement) while deploying shadows to black out the real, obscuring lingering impressions of an anom- alous European presence. Fond of the panorama, a conceit characterized by Marie Louise Pratt as the "promontory description" or "monarch-of-all-I-survey" scene, the Tharauds modernized 19th-century narrative techniques of visual mastery, substituting aerial photography as the mediating equivalent of painterly per- spective.13 Here, they fulfilled Epstein's dream of a truly modern photogeny. Fulminating against the deadness of picturesque landscape in film ("the land- scape film is, for the moment, a big zero The picturesque in cinema is zero, nothing, negation"), and summoning futurist technology to render "land- scape's dance" with "cinematic vivacity," Epstein wrote: "I yearn for a drama aboard a merry-go-round, or more modern still, in airplanes. The fair below and its surroundings would be progressively confounded. Centrifuged in this way, and adding vertigo and rotation to it, the tragedy would increase its pho- togenic quality tenfold" (E 94-95). The final vignette of the Tharauds' book on Marrakech essays to capture the kind of centrifugal movement sought after by Epstein, insofar as the limits of textual form would permit such an effect: "And so it is, that suddenly as if by a miracle I escape from all this monoto- ny. I take off in the air. An airplane carries me, while meantime the thousand gazes pursuing us seem to tie us to the earth like the tail of a kite. Soon the encampment assumes the aspect of a box of toy soldiers unwrapped on a table. Everything becomes still. I no longer distinguish the whiteness of tents squashed on the plateau and the minuscule brochettes of horses and mules attached by cord. Soon even every trace of human life disappears. To the right and left of the plane, two high chains of mountains seem to rise up on purpose to guide our passage; but above us, in the corridor we follow, the land flattens, equals out; accidents of terrain form only a vast, smooth stretch of a beautiful orange color where ravines and hills resemble the shadowy waves of a rich moire fabric I have beneath my eyes something which makes me think of a piece of anatomy, with its arteries, veins and lesser vessels "But what are needle-points of light that I see there, stuck into the pelt? It takes me a moment to realize that this porcupine hail consists of thousands upon thousands of date tree trunks crowned by palms surrounding Marrakech. The city unveils herself in her gardens. The immense caravanserai of earth and dried mud, which gives so strong an impression of rubble, of the ruined and indecipherable, when one peregrinates by foot or mule in its streets, shows itself from a bird's-eye view to be a handsome design without error, with its courtyards and terraces, its rectangular spaces, its alternating whites and blacks, to be a real fantasy of the geometer or applied draughtsman. Ah! the unique sensation of being able, virtually, to raze the terraces, open up this secret life of Islam to the naked eye! But hardly has this illusion had time to lodge inside the spirit, then the book is closed, the machine landed, and one's moment as a bird gone forever."14 An exhilarating vertigo motivates this passage, yet this technovision pro- jects a brutal wish to see a corrected, modernized, razed Morocco - a land of Islamic mystery opened up to Western use, camera ready, its organs delivered over after surgical intervention. The use of scale, another cinematic value championed by Epstein, heightens the effect of a dominated frontier; the miniaturization of horses, mules, and nomads turns Morocco momentarily into an infantilized territory littered with toys. On another level, this passage reveals a deeper, more complicated relation- ship between photogeneity and colonial vision. In the figure of "the thousand gazes pursuing us" that "seem to tie us to the earth like the tail of a kite" there is a flash apparition of the colonizing subject being pinned by a higher gaze, approximating the Lacanian anecdote of Petitjean's sardine can, which, though you can't see it, can see you. In exploring this angle, I am thinking about how to reinterpret some of the Lacanian stagings of "light on the subject" in his seminar on the "line and the light," where something resembling a "ray of God" overflows the retina, preventing the subject "at each point from being a screen" (L 96). "That which is light looks at me, and by means of that light in the depths of my eye, something is painted - something that is not simply a constructed relation, the object on which the philosopher lingers - but something that is an impression, the shimmering of a surface that is not, in advance, situated for me in its distance. This is something that introduces what was elided in the geometral relation - the depth of field, with all its ambiguity and variabili- ty, which is in no way mastered by me. It is rather it that grasps me, solicits me at every moment, and makes of the landscape something other than a land- scape, something other than what I have called the picture" (L 96). Read against the Tharauds' airborne view of Marrakech, this passage seems to set up the photogeneity of place as a shimmering, philosophical light in the landscape informing the spectator that he doesn't see it but rather that it sees him. With theological intensity, Morocco "unveils her face" only to occlude the bird's-eye viewer with an overpowering light. In this way, the pho- togene slips from its function as agent of visual publicity to be recast as an . ethical headbeam that puts the colonial viewer back in his or her place - that is, out of the picture. Where the Tharauds eradicated the indigenous sublime through aerial optical ity, the far more successful writer André Malraux used the metaphysics Aerial shot of the Valley of the Tombs, from André Malraux, La Reine de Saba Rabat, from André Chevrillon, Visions du Maroc, 1933. Illustrations F. Détaillé 16.26</page><page sequence="8">of elevation to indulge a European fantasy of site projection that involved imaging a city where none could be found. In 1934, shortly after winning the Goncourt prize for La Condition humaine, Malraux set out to find the lost city of the Queen of Sheba, an exploit that was part publicity stunt, part orien- talist dreamwork. Inspired by literary renderings of Sheba's visit to King Solomon in Judea, stirred by essays in the Bulletin de géographie that hypo- thetical ly situated Sheba7s city of origin in Pharonic Egypt, biblical Sinai, Palestine, Syria, and Yemen, Malraux resolved to rescue this dead urban treasure from obscurity using Western technologies of aerial excavation. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was his first choice of pilot, but after the literary aviator turned him down, he convinced Edouard Corniglion-Molnier to be his guide. Eventually collected under the title La Reine de Saba: une "aventure géographique" (1934), Malraux7s articles adopted the narrative structure of epic adven- ture and colonial hubris. The hero's role is performed by the Icarian plane, surging forth as a miracle of "whiteness," "an apparatus that is the West itself. 7/15 Strident occidentalism is a leitmotif of the mission: when the government of Yemen creates a diplomatic fracas over the fliers7 failure to request air rights, Malraux responded indignantly that a Frenchman in pursuit of honorable discoveries was answerable only to a nation as powerful as France (RS 96-97). Such conceits of national supremacy are reinforced by the rhetoric of sexual conquest. As the airplane pursues its course over the Arabian desert, scouring Yemen between the cities of Sana7a and Mareb, the Queen of Sheba7s imaginary body is increasingly displaced &lt; to a landscape of photogeny. Viewed from above, the threatening spectacle of the informe gives way to shapes of explicit castratory menace: medusal dunes, shark-toothed mountain ranges, the wounded, strafed terrain of the steppes, shock-inducing desert expans- es of "geological solitude,77 dark, ominous hatching outlining the Valley of the Tombs. Swooping down, the plane enacts its powers of inquisitorial master; the "prodigious spectacle of a dead city77 (a dummy capital near Mareb thought to be the possible loca- tion of Sheba) is gradually brought into line with European modernism as Malraux compared to what he perceived of the ruin - its tubular columns, oval towers, and chunky ramparts - to the blocky white architecture of Robert Mallet-Stevens (RS 78). As if to reinforce the stamp of European projection on this mythic desert town, Malraux included draw- ings by the architect-urbanist André P. Hardy fea- turing imaginary reconstructions of Sheba7s temple in the style of French modernism, its grids, pyra- mids, and colossal towers drawn up, as it were, out of the contours of the desert like some ancient antecedent of Le Corbusier7s formes courbes projected for the littoral of Algeria between 1931 and 1934. Imagined out of the aerial vision of this "vast, virtually white spot, a beachhead of colossal stones in the middle of the sand77 (RS 73), this antique ville radieuse, subordinating Middle Eastern building types to the codes of white modernity, inevitably con- jures up Le Corbusier7s abstracted colonial landscape. Though it may seem crude to interpret Corbusian whiteness as a Western sublimation of North African vernacular, the texts and illustrations of his Algerian project appear to warrant a critical perspective dealing with raced subtexts of urban formalism. Like Malraux and the Tharaud brothers, Le Corbusier made his appraisal of the ter- ritory by air: "The airplane reveals to us a miracle of wisdom, of knowledge- able and salutary order; above, opening up like living shells is the fragmentary greenery of the gardens. The elegant design of the arcades in the middle of the country of Thirst, reveals a true civilization.7716 In the various projects for Algiers, aerodynamic futurism and relief-map vision were harnessed in the service of "urban biology77 - a plan for a new Mediterranean capital set along the sinuous striation of an autoroute. With pedagogical intent, La ville radieuse mobilized aerial vision to unblock passageways into old Algiers that were barred to the outsider. In one drawing, an airplane loops stylishly around a minaret in the M7zab desert; the caption scrawled next to it comments approvingly on how the "plane discovers the city's secrets.77 The image of inte- riors pried open for inspection was enhanced by the jumble of tourist post- cards - pictures of veiled women in archways and walls - that Le Corbusier used to make a personal album of "suggestive documents.77 The implicit justi- fication for such violations of private space may be found in sketches and captions praising the barbares for their ingenious solutions to urban dwelling. In adapting the white stucco wash of local Algerian architecture to the "whiter than white77 transparency of the European unité d'habitation, Le Corbusier captured the photogeneity of local color and put it to use in a for- mally glamorous, decolorized aesthetic of modernism. Arguably, this colonial implant inserted in the corpus of European architecture can be read as an avenging antibody (a suppressed noirness) only now manifesting itself now within the postcolonial politics of third-world urbanism. A recent novel by the Martinican author Patrick Chamoiseau entitled Texaco (1992) grounds the politics of postcolonial territoriality in the land- scape itself. A barren landmass of oil derricks belonging to the American oil conglomerate becomes the site for the foundation of a new town, baptized "Texaco77 when a postcolony of squatters occupies the site. They pass symbol- ically from the equivalent of the stone to the iron age, building first in mud, then in fiber cement, and finally in heavy-duty concrete. From zone-vide petrolscape to permanent settlement, Texaco - unlike Boudjedra7s mythic North African town robbed of its identity by the movie camera - emerges as an earthwork of Afro-Caribbean enfranchisement whose photogeny is cast in the style art brut. A landscape of cement bunkers, Texaco concocts its strange, austere beauty out of a creolized urbanism in which sex, race, and power have been intermar- ried and placed in what Edouard Glissant would call "a state of eruption,77 itself a "burst in modernity.7717 Here, as in the notion of a more generalized photoge- ny that I have tried to construct, the "sex77 of buildings or the erotic "racing77 of landscape resides in displaced or abstracted visual significations rather than in literal transfers of the raced, sexed body to the nonfigurative visual subject. The literal approach is evident in many of the works of art and media exhibited at the Pompidou Center7s 1995 show "Féminimasculin: le sexe de 1 7a rt, 77 where phallic and vulval morphologies bear a cartoonish referentiality. Sigmar Polke7s photograph of rifted mountain cliffs, for example, reveals a striking intention to accentuate the landscape's resemblance to a clitoris. While I would not nec- essarily want to exclude images of this kind as examples of photogenic - in the sense of sexed or sexy - landscape, I would also like to stress that photoge- ny should not necessarily be tied to visual one-linerism or mimetic anthropo- morphism. Part of the interest of this investigation of the dark spaces of noir, or the "faces77 of landscape, or the aerial perspectives and cartographic con- figurations of imperial vision, has been to explore more mediated strategies for defining nonfigurative visual seductions in a postcolonial moment when all identities - whether of bui Idings, landscapes, or societies - have become sub- ject to the unsettling mirages of photogenic representation.
