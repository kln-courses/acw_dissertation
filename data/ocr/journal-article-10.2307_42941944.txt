On January 5, 1943, Mr. Meir Schenkolewsky of Brooklyn, New York, handed the Annual Conference of the Jewish Orthodox Rescue Committee an unusual letter, forwarded to him through Zurich, Switzerland. The letter pertained to the martyrdom of 92 pupils and their teacher of a Beit Ya'akov school in Cracow, Poland, who chose mass suicide by poison rather than submission to forced prostitution demanded by German soldiers. The epistle, dated August 11, 1942, was composed by the teacher, ^his article is a revised version of papers presented at the 20th Annual Sholars' Conference (Vanderbilt University, March 4-6, 1990), and the 1990 Annual Meeting of the National Association of Professors of Hebrew (November 18, 1990).

Deemed authentic by officials of the American Beit Ya'akov Committee in an emergency meeting held in their New York office, 131 West 86th St., the letter was made public by Rabbi Leo Jung of the Jewish Center of New York City on January 7, 1943. The next day, The New York Times carried the story, in a single column on page 8, and printed selections of the letter as translated by Rabbi Jung: Dear Friend2 in New York: I do not know whether this letter will reach you. Do you still remember who I am? We met in the same house of [the late] Mrs. [Sarah] Schenirer [founder of the Beth Jacob movement] and afterward again in Marienbad.3 When this letter will come into your hands, I shall not live anymore. With us are ninety-two Beth Jacob girls. Within a few hours everything will be over. Give our regards to Mr. [Jacob] Rosenheim [head of the world Beth Jacob movement] and our friend [Harry A.] Goodman [an English benefactor of the Beth Jacob movement], both in England. We all met in Warsaw at our friend's Y 4 and Y - 's son was also there. We had four rooms. On July twenty-seventh we were taken out and thrown into a dark room, having only water. We studied the sacred works and got courage. In age we are from fourteen to twenty-two; the younger ones are afraid. I try to recall Mother Sarah's [Mrs. Schenirer's] teaching of the Torah.5 It is good to live for God, but it is also good to die for Him.6 Yesterday and the day before we were given hot baths and we were told that German soldiers would come tonight to visit us. We yesterday swore to ourselves that we shall die together. Yesterday one sent us to a big house with bright rooms and nice beds. The Germans do not know that our last bath is our purification before death. Today, everything was taken from us, and we were each given one nightgown. All of us have poison. When the soldiers will come we shall drink it. Today we are together and all day we are saying our last confession. We have no fear. 2Meir Schenkolewsky of Brooklyn, New York (Williamsburg section). ^The Third Great Assembly of Agudath Israel was held in Marienbad (West Bohemia, Czechoslovakia).

We have one request: Say Kaddish [the Hebrew prayer for the dead] for us, your ninety-three children. Soon we shall be with Mother Sarah. Regards from 7 of Krakow The terrifying matter of the Ninety-Three Maidens who said their last prayer (the viduî), took poison, and died, "in order to sanctify the Name of God by their death as well as by their lives," elicited a plethora of cross- denominational support. Rabbi Leo Jung saw the martyrdom of the Beit Ya'akov maidens in the noblest pattern of Kiddush Hashem. "It is unmatched in simplicity and sublimity, a living testimonial of Beth Jacob's service to Israel, indeed to all believers in the universal Father of man."8 Invited to comment on the letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens by the editors of The Reconstructionist , Dr. Dora Edinger reflected, "I have met people that could not believe this sacrifice to have been offered in the way it has been reported. Since I have been in the Beth Jacob seminary, I am perfectly convinced that these Jewish girls proved in the last test, that they were true to the spirit of their education."9 The "spirit" was forged against Orthodox educators, who opposed the teaching of Torah to girls, in the hundreds of Beth Jacob schools throughout Poland between the two great wars. It was inspired by the spell of Sarah Schenirer's personality: love, respect, childlike devotion to God, Torah, mitzvot, and ahavat yisrael , dedication and selfless sacrifice. In a feature article, "In the Valley of Death," published in The New York Times Magazine, 7 February 1943, Scholom Asch, the noted Yiddish novelist, analyzed the deeper meanings of the Ninety-Three Maidens in conjunction with the announced Nazi murders of the Jewish population in Poland. He concluded that Hitler would never have selected the extermination of the Jews if the road had not been prepared for him by all kinds and degrees of antisemites. "It is a fact that all who have prepared the ground of hatred toward the Jews and other races are exactly as responsible for the bestial slaughter of the Jews in Poland, and others, as Hitler and his clique. Even if today they are frightened by the results of 7Chaya Feldman from Cracow. 8Leo Jung, The Path of a Pioneer (London: Soncino Press, 1980), p. 148. 9The Reconstructionist , ix.2, March 5, 1943, pp. 23-24.</page><page sequence="4">72 SHOFAR Fall 1993 Vol. 12, No. 1 their hatred, they are as guilty as the Nazis. Hitler only gathers the fruit of their well-planted seed."10 Finally, the testimony of the Ninety-Three Maidens has been immortal- ized by the Hebrew poet and professor of Hebrew literature at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Lithuanian-born Hillel Bavli (1892-1961): "The Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens"11 We have cleansed our bodies and purified our souls And now we are at peace. Death holds no terror; we go to meet it. We have served our God while alive; We know how to hallow Him in death. A deep covenant binds all ninety-three of us; Together we studied God's Torah; together we shall die. We have chanted Psalms, and are comforted. We have confessed our sins, and are strengthened. We are now prepared to take our leave. Let the unclean come to afflict us; we fear them not. We shall drink the poison and die, innocent and pure, as befits the daughters of Jacob. To our mother Sarah we pray: "Here we are! We have met the test of Isaac's Binding!12 Pray with us for the people Israel. " Compassionate Father! Have mercy for Your people, who love you. For there is no more mercy in man.13 Reveal Your lovingkindness. 10Scholem Asch, "In the Valley of Death," The New York Times Magazine , 7 February 1943, p. 36. His "A Child Leads the Way" is a fictionalized account of the martyrdom of the Ninety-Three. See S. Asch, Tales of My People, tr.

"The Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens," by Hillel Bavli, was featured in the American Hebrew bi-weekly, Hadoar , vol. 23.12, and an English translation by Bertha Badt-Strauss appeared in The Reconstructionist , ix.2, March 5, 1943, p. 23. 12Lines echo "The Binding of Isaac" (the Akedah), Gen. 22 (especially sentences 1, 7, 11), the Torah reading for the second day of Rosh Hashanah, and part of the morning service every day of the year. 13A similar thought is conveyed by Haim Nahman Bialik (1873-1934) on the atrocities of the Kishinev Easter pogrom (April 6 and 7, 1903) in his poem, "On the Slaughter" (Iyar, 1903).</page><page sequence="5">The Ninety-Three Beit-Ya'akov Martyrs 73 Save your afflicted people. Cleanse and preserve your world. The hour of Ne'ilah approaches, Quiet grow our hearts. One request we make of our brethren, wherever they may be. Say Kaddish for us, for all ninety-three, say Kaddish. Bavli's stark crossing of Mama Sarah (Schenirer) and Mother Sarah, the sacrifice of the Ninety-Three and the Akedah, and the implied vidui on approaching death14 and the Ne'ilah service of Yom Kippur combine to make his poem a liturgical favorite for Conservative Jews, and others, during the solemn Yom Kippur Eleh Ezkerah service. II. Few doubt the powerful cadences of Bavli's poem, read in Shoah memorial services, and the powerful values of observant Jews who died 9 al Kiddush Hashem as suggested by the Letter of the Ninety-Three, but is the event a true (meaning, historical) account of the last daughters of Jacob, who studied in the Jewish quarter of Cracow, the Beit-Ya'akov seminary on Stanislawa 10? The silence of historians on the Shoah, in contrast to pietists, in assessing this letter suggests that the document is not to be taken seriously. One who has spoken, however, the late Lucy S. Dawido- wicz, author of The War Against the Jews 1933-1945 (1975), The Holo- caust Reader (1976), and The Holocaust and the Historians (1981), among other works, has dismissed it as a pious fraud. A less pernicious form of historical falsification is the myth pretending to documentary veracity. In Holocaust history myths are especially abundant about the behavior of pious Jews in circumstances of extreme crisis; this is in fact a genre with many precedents in Jewish history. The most wide- spread such story is probably that of the ninety-three (more or less) devout girls of a Beth Jacob school in the Cracow ghetto who chose mass suicide over the degradation of a German brothel. It is a fanciful and moving tale of sacrificial piety, a lesson in religious morality, fashioned by people who knew nothing of the Nuremberg Laws which made sexual relations between 14The vidui sbekiv mera' ("Confession on a Death Bed") and the Ne'ilah (concluding) service of Yom Kippur end with identical refrains: The Lord is King; the Lord was King; the Lord shall be King for ever and ever; Blessed be His Name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever; The Lord He is God; Hear O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord is One.</page><page sequence="6">74 SHOFAR Fall 1993 Vol. 12, No. 1 Germans and Jews illegal, criminal, and subject to severe punishment.15 The Nuremberg Laws referred to by historian Dawidowicz were promulgated on September 15, 1935. Paragraphs 1-3 speak against marriages between Jews and state members of German or cognate blood; extra-marital relations between Jews and state members of German or cognate blood are prohibited; and Jews must not engage female domestic help in their households among state members of German or cognate blood, who are under forty-five years old.16 Despite the Nazi fury against the Jews, the racist principles of the Nuremberg Laws were not always strictly applied by the Germans to the Jews of Poland. Shoah responsa literature deals with women prostituted by the Germans, and some were tattooed by the words, "prostitute for Hitler's soldiers."17 Affidavits mentioned in The Black Book of Polish Jewry18 convey, not infrequently, the humiliation of Jewish women: random roundup (forced labor, rape), and forced entry into their homes where they were raped, 15-16-year-olds among them, before parents and relatives. Regarding brothels, several eyewitness accounts will suffice. In January/February 1940, a session of the Health Department of the Warsaw municipality agreed to open a brothel in Warsaw for the German military forces: 50 Jewish girls figured among the prostitutes.19 In an affidavit signed in New York City on January 14, 1940, Dr. Henry Szoszkies, a former member of the Executive of the Warsaw Jewish Community Council, declared, "I hereby affirm that to my knowledge proposals were made by Nazi officials to the Jewish Community Council to organize houses of prostitution in Nazi-occupied towns, and that Jewish girls be provided for use of the army."20 He went on to describe a meeting at the central office of the Gestapo at 23 Szucha Street, room 37, 15Lucy S.

To Szoszkies' anguished cry that "nobody in our community will accept it- even if death is the penalty for all of us," Unit Leader Wende, speaking for the German Gestapo, replied: "Mr. Szoszkies, you take the matter much too tragically. After all you are a man and you can understand us; we need women and we believe that we are proposing a plan for the Jewish community from which it can profit. Don't let race laws bother you [italics added]. War is war, and in such a situation all theories die out."22 So also, lehavdil , Dawidowicz's objection to the Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens based on prohibition of race mingling. The events described in the letter appear to telescope incidents from July 27 to August 11, 1942. But questions abound regarding content and several names. How did the maidens under the scrutiny of their German guards manage to provide poison for themselves and to find time for group study, therapy, and communal prayers? Who are the Ninety-Three Maidens and why has no family member stepped forward to claim knowledge of their being? There is no known burial spot or mass grave for the victims nor any supportive evidence, outside of Agudath Israel lore, that describes the terrifying ordeal.23 Though the names Marienbad, Rosenheim, Goodman, and, of course, Sarah Schenirer, can be identified, the names "Sholemman" and "Sholemszon" appear contrived. Chaya Feldman from Cracow is known only from this document; there appears to be no collateral evidence of her person. Among the living, Mr. Friedenzon from New York, editor of Dos Yiddishe Vort (Yiddish), questioned the historicity of the account.24 Rabbi Moshe Klotne, archivist of Agudath Israel Archives in New York, expressed reservations about its facticity, but he strongly asserted that the girls' martyrdom has not become the central piece in Agudath teaching about 2lBlack Book , p. 27. 22Black Book, p. 27. 23An early "witness" to the suicide is Hanah Weiss, "Kiddush Hashem: The Heroic Death of the Ninety-Three Maidens in the Cracow Ghetto in 13 Av 5702" (Tel Aviv: Beit Ya'akov, 1947), pamphlet (Hebrew), 39 pages.

He observed, since the communication had been used only as a warning signal for the impending Judeocide and (later) consciousness raising, and never for fund-raising, that this, in his opinion, is (further) proof of the intent and sincerity of the document. III. Some impressions concerning the syntax of the letter by Chaya Feldman are in order. The letter reflects the Judeo-German favored by Jews in Cracow, and elsewhere in Poland, at the time of the German occupation. Written basically in Latin " antiqua, " it contains strong influences from German so- called "gothic," most strikingly in d, t, k, z, R, J, W, S, and many more. This by itself is not surprising because in Germany, Austria, and Switzer- land, the "gothic" gave way to "antiqua" in the schools in the early 1930s. Complicated features of New High German syntax are featured. For example, the author uses "kennenlernen" (to meet, get to know), where 25Per verbal (phone) communication, February 19, 1990. 26Per verbal (phone) communication, February 21, 1990. 27Chaim Shapiro, "A Flame Called Sarah Schenirer," The Jewish Observer , November- December 1974, p. 19- ^Per verbal (phone) communication, February 20, 1990. 29Yitzchak Lewin, editor, Eleb Ezkerah (New York: Shulsinger Bros, 1956-1972). Note, too, that there is no reference to the Ninety-Three in The Black Book of Polish Jeu&gt;ry , which lists Dr. Lewin as co-editor.</page><page sequence="9">The Ninety-Three Beit-Ya'akov Martyrs 77 "kennen," a verb, serves as a separable prefix to another verb, "lernen" (to learn), and uses it in the present perfect tense with the right word order. More complicated and properly used is 44 Den 27 Juli sind wir geholt worden. ..." First, it requires a good knowledge of German to write "den 27 Juli" instead of "der 27 Juli," using the accusative "den" (which is correct) rather than the more tempting "der." And then, this phrase is in the passive voice, requiring "sein" (to be) as the auxiliary instead of "haben" (to have). Also, the use of "worden," instead of the more logical "geworden," a word that has in this mutilated form no meaning except in the present perfect and past perfect tenses of the passive voice. Knowledge of German syntax is indicated in the proper use of adjective endings which requires a knowledge of noun genders and cases. Examples (including so-called "der"-words and "ein"-words): dieser Brief/ das Land/ der Brief; aus dem Rosch David (knowledge that "aus" must be followed by the dative case)/ die Jungen/ deutsche Soldaten/ in ein grosze¿ Haus (accusative neuter after the preposition "in," if the action implies change of location or condition)/ mit haellera Zim em and schoenen Bet en (haellem is dative singular and case required is dative plural, but the writer knew that mit requires the dative case; schoenen is correct dative plural)/ ein Hemt. Another refined use of syntax: "Wen Soldaten Kernen werden wir alle drincken" ("When soldiers come, we will all drink"). It requires a good knowledge of German to know that if the subordinate clause (introduced by "wen") precedes the main clause, the verb of the main clause ("wer- den") precedes the subject: "When the soldiers come will we all drink." Also, the final greeting requires a knowledge of how to use the impersonal es in German, here: "It greets you," which is very idiomatic and very correct. It is a less formal substitute for the stiff: "Be greeted." And a bit less informal and personal than "Ich grusse Sie." The more or less good German syntax is punctuated by Cracow Yiddish orthography: to write almost consistently sz for any s sound (s, ss, sz); to write final t instead of d; to write ai instead of ei; to replace umlaut with correct umlaut substitute e (ue/ ae/ oe); to write "nischt" and "gelaernt" instead of "nicht" and "gelernt"; and to consistently ignore double consonants that are so prevalent in German. Also, distinctive Yiddish words are utilized: mairoh, taitscĶ hachem , Rosch (posuk) Davit , teveley Kadisch , jom, vidujoh (vidui), and schwio (shevuah). Finally, the handwriting is from one older than age 22, who retained now and then an amazing elegance in a word here and there (e.g., the word "Marienbad," beginning on line 5; see Appendix).</page><page sequence="10">78 SHOFAR Fall 1993 Vol. 12, No. 1 In summation, the Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens does not meet the rigorous standard of a factual historical document. One cannot say that it is Historie : controlled objective facts, in keeping with the closed cause- effect continuum, and characteristic of a modern scientific understanding of history. But the letter can be seen as a true reflection of the nature and sentiments taught at the Beit Ya'akov seminary in Cracow, including the pious obligation of Kiddush Hashem. We suggest that the document be considered Geschichte , above the historical but attached to it and in no way determined by it. It conveys personal meaningful memory, whose events impinge on man's life in keeping with the nature of Shoah-related events. It is faith-history, existential and subjective. It represents paradig- matic and not pragmatic concern; it is historiosophy (a philosophy of history) and not historiography. IV. The Ninety-Three Maidens are martyrs within a subliminal Kiddush Hashem universe, but they are not facts on the ground. The significance of their document does not depend exclusively upon historical information about them. What is clear is the assertion that thousands of European Beit- Ya'akov girls were taught and lived obediently by the strict laws of traditional Judaism, and a number of them, it can be assumed, would have acted in the way and fashion of the Ninety-Three Maidens. There is continuity between Beit Ya'akov "Torah Judaism" and the Ninety-Three mentioned in the epistle and in contemporary Jewish liturgy and preaching. However, to write an "historical" account of their alleged suicide, separate from the faith-paradigm a post-Shoah age has placed in it, is not only impossible, but also illegitimate and useless. The "historical Ninety-Three" is not a record of facts. The writer of the document presupposes that the maidens lived and died, since he or she sees in them an expression of genuine historical occurrence, e.g., the destruction of Cracow Orthodoxy. They are the symbolic flame of Sarah Schenirer's Torah Judaism in the struggle for human dignity and Jewish piety; and the letter's importance is in its telling message of suicide, expressed in the categorical imperative of Kiddush Hashem. The Written Torah contains no specific injunction against suicide. On the verse "And surely your blood of your lives will I require it" (Gen. 9:5a) -a thought contained in an expanded verse (s) on the prohibition of homicide- the Rabbis taught that suicide was wrong and punishable by divine decree, burial outside the sacred precincts of the cemetery, and suspension of mourning laws and customs. This stern decree, to discour-</page><page sequence="11">The Ninety-Three Beit-Ya'akov Martyrs 79 age Jews who might surrender their lives in violation of Jewish law, caused additional grief and embarrassment for the family of the deceased. To mitigate this problem, the Sages ruled that suicide must be voluntary and premeditated, meabbed azmo lada' at ("one who destroys himself know- ingly"). The rabbinic presumption is that a person who kills himself- axiomatic in cases of child suicide- does so without the necessary premedi- tation. The locus classicus is the suicide of King Saul, who was in great mental distress ". . . iest these uncircumcised [Philistines] come and thrust me through, and make a mock of me.' . . . Therefore King Saul took his sword, and fell upon it."30 His death, and the reasons for it, are used by many rabbis as a precedent for not stigmatizing a person who took his own life, if it was shown that he anguished under stress and despair ( onus k'shaul ).31 In normal times, acts of suicide are deemed blameworthy. In distress- ful times, such actions are considered praiseworthy, constituting a Kiddush Hashem, a sanctification of God's Name. In the turbulent period following the ill-fated Bar Kochba Rebellion (133-135 C.E.), the Sages decreed that a person must kill oneself or let oneself be killed if one is asked to violate cardinal sins against God and man: idolatry (apostasy), unchastity (incest, adultery), and murder (Sanh. 74a). Lore and law record countless instances of justifiable suicide, in the noblest tradition of the Sanctification of the Name, from the Maccabean revolt,32 to the Roman occupation of 30 1 Samuel 31:4. Other cases of suicide recorded in the Bible are Samson (Judges 16:30), Ahitopel (2 Samuel 17:23), and Zimri (1 Kings 16:18). Another version on the death of King Saul is reported in 2 Samuel 1:9, where we read that an Amalekite obeyed the words of a wounded Saul and slew him. 31A brief summary of martyrdom for the Sanctification of the Name is found in H. J. Zimmels, The Echo of the Nazi Holocaust in Rabbinic Literature (printed in the Republic of Ireland, 1975), pp. 82-86; and Irving J. Rosenbaum, The Holocaust and the Halakhah (New York: Ktav, 1976), pp. 35-40. 32A primary source is the Apocrypha books 1 and 2 Maccabees, which emphasize themes of religious persecution, loyalty of martyrs to tradition, and God's concern for His people. The story of the mother and her seven sons is illustrative (2 Macc. 7).</page><page sequence="12">80 SHOFAR Fall 1993 Vol. 12, No. 1 Eretz Israel,33 throughout the Middle Ages, during the Russian pogroms, and in the ghettos and murder camps of Nazi Europe.34 In one arresting passage in Rabbi H. J. Zimmel's important work, The Echo of the Nazi Holocaust in Rabbinic Literature , he writes: A different outlook on suicide in general can be found in the era of the Nazi Holocaust. Humiliation, fear of torture and starvation produced two diametrically opposed feelings among the Jews living under the Nazi heel. These feelings had great consequences in their attitude to life. One was pessimism, resignation, despair and abandonment of any hope for the future, leading to suicide. The other was optimism, a strong will to survive and to bear patiently all sufferings and hope for a change for the better. The former view was shared mainly by the Jews of Germany and Austria, while the latter attitude can be found among Jews of Poland and other eastern territories.35 The divergence in attitudes may be explained thusly: whereas the denationalized Jews of Berlin rejected the pillar of Orthodoxy, the Jews of Kovno, Cracow, and other centers of commitment to traditional Judaism chose the guidelines which instructed life under the most horrific circumstances, since their rabbis taught them that an action of suicide "is a hillul ha-Shem (profanation of the Name) because it shows that the Jews do not trust in God to save them. . . ."36 33The Yom Kippur musaf service contains the Eleh Ezkera ("These I well remember") prayer in behalf of ten martyrs, including Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Hananya ben Teradyon, whose martyrdoms are reported - contrary to talmudic sources - to have taken place on the same day. Though the prayer is post-talmud ic, it properly portrays the harsh times for Jewish scholars between and after the revolts against Rome (first and second centuries). 34 A sampling of documents on the persecution of Jews in the medieval and modern periods are found in relevant sections of Jacob Marcus, The Jew in the Medieval World (Cleveland and New York: Meridan Books, 1961), and Mendes-Flohr and Reinharz, The Jeu t in the Modern World. Various literary responses to Jewish martyrdom and suffering, a veritable literary history of destruction, are presented in Alan Mintz, Hurhati : Responses to Catastrophe in Hebrew Literature (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984); David Roskies, Against the Apocalypse: Responses to Catastrophe in Modern Jeu fish Culture (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985); David Roskies, The Literature of Destruction (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society), 19 88); and Pesach Schindler, Hasidic Responses to the Holocaust in the Light of Hasidic Thought (New Jersey: Ktav, 1990). 35H. J. Zimmels, p. 83. ^Rabbi Ephraim Oshry, Sheilos Utshuvos Mimamakim , vol. I, no. 6, cited in H. J. Zimmels, p. 85. Rabbi Oshry goes on to say with admiration that in the "Ghetto of Kovno there were no cases of suicide save in the three instances. All the other inmates of the Ghetto believed with perfect faith that God would not forsake His people. . . ."</page><page sequence="13">The Ninety-Three Beit-Ya'akov Martyrs 81 Contra responsa from the Shoah and the ruling of m. Terumot 8.12, "If Gentiles said to many women, 'Give us one from among you that we may defile her, and if not we will defile you all/ let them defile them all, but let them not betray to them one soul from Israel,"37 the Ninety-Three Maidens chose suicide rather than submit to a forced act of prostitution. On strict halachic terms, irrespective of historical validity, choosing death, in this case over prostitution, though emotionally commendable, is an ' averah (transgression) against the will of Heaven, which proclaims, "Choose life."38 In this regard, the Halachah is consistent with the view of post-70 C.E. Tannaim, who consciously avoided any written reference to the contemporary Masada suicide. Despite Flavius Josephus's portrayal of Masada as the final act of the Great Revolt against Rome in terms of horror and annihilation on the one hand and courage and heroism on the other,39 these Rabbis ofYavneh and Usha saw in everyday acts of holiness expressed in the formula "Choose life" to be more significant than catastrophic events, however, heroic, as the lasting way for Jewry. This may well explain why the Orthodox community which spun the tale of the Ninety-Three does not utilize it as a paragon of Jewish living. For a nationalist view on the assimilationist tendency of nineteenth-century Jews of Berlin, see Peretz Smolenskin, "The Haskalah of Berlin (1883)," in Arthur Hertzberg, The Zionist Idea (New York: Althenum, 1975), pp. 154-157. 37In a collection of responsa arranged according to the order of the Shulhan Arukh, Mahatieh Hayyim (1879-1885), section 2, no. 19, Rabbi Hayyim Ben Mordechai Ephraim Rischei Sofer (1921-1 886) admonished a Jewish community in "cities in Galicia" for their error in handing over Jewish girls during the German-Austrian war, in light of m. Terumot 8.12. The racial laws of the Germans prevented the violation of this mishnah from repeating multiple times over. ^Deuteronomy 30:19; cf. also Ezekiel 18:32. 39Josephus Flavius, Bellum Judaicum (The Jewish War), VII. 6-11; Josephus, The Jeunsh War , trans, by G.

Above we asserted that the value of the Ninety-Three lies not in historical and halachic evidence but in historiosophy, a kind of attitude which one internally makes in response to external facts, and which is enhanced in categories of the will, of action, and of creative imagination. The nature of historiosophy, or faith-knowledge, makes its "factual distortion" irrelevant, since its message is not to assent to doctrine or mastery of historical information. Historiosophy is not validated by historical research; thus, the importance of the Ninety-Three is a contem- porary existential encounter in which the listener, confronted by their suicide as a claim on life in a proclaimed death, decides to acknowledge (or not acknowledge) the Sanctification of the Name. This response of faith is itself a part of Heilsgeschichte (salvation history), just as the proclama- tion of it is part of Kiddush Hashem. To seek historical validation behind the Ninety-Three is to deny its power in realized eschatology, which in turn denies the strong appeal of Kiddush Hashem itself. The Ninety-Three is mythicizing history, i.e., the way tradition portrays heroism and martyrdom. On the one hand, ancient archetypes- for example, David's lament over Saul and Jonathan: Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain! How are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. (2 Sam 1:19-20) -reinforce and echo the story of the death of the Ninety-Three Maidens, whose suicide avoided the mockery of the German Philistines. Again, Jephthah's daughter, who dies childless, and the Ninety-Three Maidens share a similar fate of grief and reproach: neither brought new life into being and nobody knows their grave.40 On the other hand, the story of the Ninety-Three adds to historiosophy by helping to shape the response of the Jew to the anguish of the European Jews. Take "Rachel weeping for her children," for example: Thus saith the Lord: A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation, and bitter weeping, 40See Judges 11, and especially w. 34-40.</page><page sequence="15">The Ninety-Three Beit-Ya 'akov Martyrs 83 Rachel weeping for her children: She refuseth to be comforted for her children, Because they are not. Thus saith the Lord: Refrain thy voice from weeping, And thy eyes from tears; For thy work shall be rewarded, Saith the Lord; And they shall come back from the land of the enemy. (Jeremiah 31:l6-17)41 Are not the Ninety-Three Maidens, portrayed as pure in body and holy in soul, true daughters of Rachel our Mother? Yehareg v'lo ya'avor ,42 they are "killed and do not transgress" merits their plea on behalf of the mur- dered before the throne of God, who hears their just cry and declares: "Refrain from weeping . . . for thy work shall be rewarded" (Jer. 31, above). Alas, the heavenly proclamation descends as an imposing silence on earth. Paradoxically, this abdication of traditional theology, that is, compen- satory reward for sincere trial and tribulation, permits a more radical yearning, couched in a sacred archetype adapted to contemporary thoughts and feelings, to emerge, wherein one may find a sustaining challenge to the silence of God and the voice of man. Gittin 57b reports the mass suicide by drowning of young boys and girls who had been taken captive and destined for a shameful life in Rome. The young children were convinced that suicide would not impede their voyage to the World to Come, when the oldest of them quoted Psalm 41These sentences are part of the Haftorah reading for the second day of Rosh Hashanah (Jer. 31:2-20); the Torah reading on this day is the "Binding of Isaac," the Akedah (Gen. 22:1-24). In Jewish tradition, both readings are understood as patriarchal-matriarchal (parental) entreaty in behalf of the Children of Israel. 42Pesahim 25b relates the narrative of a man who asked Rabba, what should he do if one in authority threatens to kill him unless he would kill another person. Rabba's answer, "Be killed and kill not. Who has told you that your blood is redder than his? Perhaps his blood is redder." Rabba's teaching is to honor the sixth injunction of the Decalogue, "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17); however, the decision of the Ninety-Three Maidens to sacrifice their lives is viewed as a sacrificial intercession on behalf of innocent blood before divine justice.</page><page sequence="16">84 SHOFAR Fall 1993 Vol. 12, No. 1 68:23: "The Lord said: I will bring back from Bashan,43 I will bring them back from the depths of the sea," and explained, mibashan (from Bashan) means mibein shinei ary eh ('from the teeth of the lion/Rome), and "I will bring them back from the depths of the sea" suggests that 44 they who drowned in the sea" will share in the World to Come.44 Lamenting the drowning suicide of the 400 children, an editorial note applies to them the verse from Ps. 44:23: "It is for your sake that we are slain all day long, that we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered." The Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens, knowingly or unknowingly, is anchored to this talmudic story. Both episodes speak of children, whose suicide is of the highest madreiga (level, standard)- no killing of reluctant victims nor blood spilled. Each act of Kiddush Hashem is encouraged by the oldest child, who assures his/her eager and innocent followers that heavenly approval and reward await them. Alliteration of the word bashan connotes boshna/boshet (shame, ill repute). Further, the prooftext from Ps. 68:24 talks of righteous vengeance against the enemies of God (i.e., Rome, Nazis), "the dogs shall lick the blood of their slain." However, there is a difference: God redeems from Bashan, but the maidens, by their suicide, acted in God's stead and redeemed from boshet (act of ill repute). May a passive God not be accountable? Are the innocent Ninety-Three Maidens- and by extension, all Shoah-Jews who have followed the Torah path- suffering and "killed all day long" for His sake? Unacceptable is the apologia, divine punishment for disloyalty, for they are virtuous, and their hard faith urgently requests divine intervention: Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, and forgettest our affliction and oppression? For our soul is bowed down to the dust; Our belly cleaveth unto the earth Arise for our help 43The aggadic discourse speaks of saving the righteous martyred children; the pesbat of "I will bring back," is God's resolve to seek, find, and bring to justice those who rebel against Him, whether they hide among the hills of Bashan (the fertile tract of country in the East of Jordan, between Hermon in the North, Salchah in the East, Gilead in the South, Geshar and Ma'achah in the West) or in the depths of the sea. Cf. Psalm 68:24. "Fascination about the 400 Children is well attested in Jewish lore and tradition: the Halachah of Rabbi Moshe Gaon b. Rav Hanoch, an exile from Spain; the poetry of Y. L. Gordon; the rabbinic lore of H. N. Bialik and Y. Rawnitsky, Sefer ba-Aggadab (1908-1911); and Z. Kolitz's short story, MYossel Rakover's Appeal to God," among disparate sources.</page><page sequence="17">The Ninety-Three Beit-Ya 'akov Martyrs 85 And redeem us for Thy mercy's sake. (Ps. 44:24-27) "The Keeper of Israel that neither slumbers nor sleeps" (Ps. 121:4) is implored to save Israel, and by so doing, "give glory unto Thy name" (Ps. 115:1). He is inseparably linked with the destiny of Israel; and in the face of unremitting tragedy, when many nameless sanctify His name, He is beseeched to manifest His name - holiness, righteousness, mercy - by demonstrating His saving power in behalf of Israel before all nations. What concerns the Psalmist is God's seeming indifference to His people's persecution, thereby leading to an uncertainty about a moral rule in the universe ("redeem us for Thy mercy's sake"). But the strength of man, implicit in the righteous deeds of the Ninety-Three Maidens, enables the opportunity for the saving power of God to be redeemed. Historiosophically, this may explain the letter's crescendo, "Say the Kaddish for us." On the one hand, continue the work of Torah, which the maidens and a slaughtered Yeshiva world can never again do, thereby perpetuating their memory by contributing to tikkun olam (restoring the world) and the continuity of the Jewish people. But on the other hand, continuously praising God in the name of the innocent murdered victims obligates Him for an eternity to remember the evil done;45 reminds Him that He alone could have saved His faithful people from the slaughter which befell them; and challenges Him to permit never again the mockery of the Nazis and Nazi-like behavior. A final observation. The Nazi terror campaign against European Jewry began in earnest in the summer of 1941, first in open shooting fields in areas within the Soviet Union and later in murder camps in Auschwitz and Chelmo. Verification of this systematic mass murder became known to the West, however, in June 1942, when the Jewish Bund in the Warsaw Ghetto reported up to 700,000 Polish Jews had been murdered. Governments-in- exile, press, and radio responded quickly to these atrocities, and the American Jewish Congress organized a mass protest meeting in Madison Square Garden on July 22, 1942. In early August 1942, Gerhart Reigner, the World Jewish Congress representative in Switzerland, alerted the United States Consulate in Geneva and the British Foreign Office that he 45Ever since Sinai, the language of Jewish anthropomorphism has portrayed God as curtailing the evil decree against His people (Exodus 32:9-14), when warranted by a purposeful attitudinal change in the life of the people. If the character and conduct of the people are proper and righteous from the outset, and still they are murdered, shall not the "Lord repent of this evil done to His people" (Exod. 32:14)?</page><page sequence="18">86 SHOFAR Fall 1993 Vol. 12, No. 1 received an alarming report that Hitler's high command had discussed with favor a plan for the annihilation of three and a half to four million Jews in countries occupied or controlled by Germany. Reigner's cable was con- sidered too fantastic to be believed in seriously, and no direct action was taken by the allies. Against the background of these terrible days in the summer of 1942, the Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens was composed. May the letter not be seen as a protest of the Jewish spirit against a world that offered no hope for the Jews? Further, if the letter is a concoction, one wonders why the "trei wochen" leading to Tisha B'Av (9th of Av) were not intentionally chosen as the background for the maidens' ordeal. As it stands, the girls' wrenching decision occurred between 27 July and 11 August/13 Av-28 Av, the start of the period of consolation; its sublime message may be interpreted as an encouragement to maintain hope in the face of Nazi bestiality. VI. We have tried in this article to describe the dynamics of the Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens in categories of historiography and historioso- phy. The position of either historiography or historiosophy provides an agenda which exuberates an aura of certainty and absolutism. Historioso- phy alone permits no final questions, and historiography alone entertains no final answers. Historiography and historiosophy, in contrast, ask questions and attempt answers but leave many uncertainties unresolved. Yet uncertainty is truth in the making and the inevitable price of academic freedom. Since the Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens is elusive and defies pigeonhole analysis, it is fitting to conclude by suggesting lessons learned from its spirit of yiťat shamayim , hutzpah, and ahavat yisrael- fear of Heaven, courage bordering on the reckless, and love of the Jewish people. Yir'at shamayin (Fear of Heaven) Do we state that there is no God and therefore the Ninety-Three are witness to nothing? Do we declare that the lesson is the question, if God lives and He is not indifferent, can He go on living, He who has permitted the death of the Ninety-Three Maidens, symbol of the murdered righteous? Do we follow Richard Rubenstein and let go of traditional Judaism's doctrine of God for a new symbol of God's reality conclusive with the slaughter of innocents?</page><page sequence="19">The Ninety-Three Beit-Ya'akov Martyrs 87 Do we suggest Emil Fackenheim's 6l4th Commandment - there shall be no posthumous victory for Hitler- keneged ("equal to," but for many, "against") the 613 Commandments as the raison d'être for Jewish living and existence? Do we maintain Irving "Yitz" Greenberg's Voluntary Covenant and not tradition's Obligatory Covenant as a response to the shattered trust between God and Israel? Do we follow Elie Wiesel's witness-story, promoting Jewish survival as the unshakable dogma after Auschwitz?46 Or is the response the purity of Orthodox Jewish faith: There are many thoughts in the heart of man, but only the counsel of the Lord prevails. Whatever the Merciful does, He does it for our good. May His great Name be blessed for His manifold blessings. Hutzpah (Supreme Self-Confidence) The Beit Ya'akov movement is forged in the personality of its matriarch, Sarah Schenirer (1883-1935). In her own words, she entrusted her young charges, every day after morning prayers, with these words of Torah musar (ethical instruction): "And now, O Israel, what does the Lord, your God, ask of you, except to serve the Lord, your God, to walk in all his ways, to love Him and to serve the Lord, your God, with all your heart and soul."47 Sarah Schenirer knew that her seminary in Cracow could instruct to teach and to learn yiddishkeit and to establish a Jewish home in Israel, but she wondered it if could train Jewish souls. The severest test of soul- making, that of Kiddush Hashem, was not sought but came to the Ninety- Three Maidens, who did not avoid it. They thought of it as the holiest of God's commandments and met its challenge with reverence, love, and service. From the circumstances of their suicide, we learn new words about martyrdom: When one is in danger of sin (the imposed rape), when one 46For theological thoughts on Rubenstein, Fackenheim, Greenberg, and Wiesel see my "Teaching the Holocaust: The Introductory Course," in Zev Garber, with Alan L.

Death by one's own hand for the glory of Torah is considered by the Master of the Universe as a sanctification of His Name. The enormity of the cruelty that the Nazis perpetrated upon the Jews of Cracow and Warsaw is arrested by the paradigm of the Daughters of Jacob; they fulfilled the supreme mitzvah of Kiddush Has hem, with love and without regret, in order that there shall be no blemish upon their souls when they come before the seat of the Holy to plead for Israel's complete redemption. The martyred children have met the "decree from Heaven," and this permits them to say before the Holy One, Blessed be He; In Your endless wisdom, You have decreed that our generation should experience the most terrible cruelties to sanctify Your Name. We have met your request and have bettered it;48 now have mercy on the remnant of Israel, Guardian of Israel. Abavat y Israel (Selfless Love of Israel) In his preface to the volume Secretaries of Death,49 Harry James Cargas writes, "If our generation is to have meaning, it will be by the way of response to the Holocaust. If we ignore that mystery, we imperil our souls and the souls of our grandchildren yet unborn. That weight lies heavily upon us." We who read and hear the Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens are now accountable. We mock the memory of those who fought Hitler with weapons of Torah and were murdered, whose last plea was, "please say Kaddish for us," if we do not respond. But what is a proper response to their death? Do we respond with clichéd sentimentality, or deafening silence? Do we etch their memories in stones and monuments that mesmerize us into no actions? Do we let grass grow, birds sing, and children play on land where night and fog once prevailed? Do we encourage pilgrimages to crematoria, where the way to heaven was by smoke and ashes? Do we remember and not act? For the writer of the Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens, the response must be deed over creed, but not in the expected judicial sense, e.g., let 48Cf. 2 Maccabees 7:33,37: "Be one with the servants [of the Lord in the World-to-Come] and may our sacrifice (not be in vain); God be merciful to our nation." 49Lore Shelley, editor, Secretaries of Death (New York: Sheingold Publishers, 1986), p. xiv.</page><page sequence="21">The Ninety-Three Beit-Ya'akov Martyrs 89 justice not be delayed, for it will be denied, or the metaphysical-theological sense: confront Auschwitz and root out its causes from the world of God and man. Rather, to honor the memory of the saintly martyrs, is to never forget, and thereby to act Jewishly. The writer-mourner has been touched by the anti-life of the Nazi period and his/her letter reflects this sense of tragic loss and incompleteness. Paradoxically, in the face of violent interruption of self, community, and God relationship, the letter stresses the importance of life. Touched by the story of the suicide, the living are sensitized to the value and quality of religious life.50 The salient message: Do not focus on tragic death (alone), but continue to live, exuberating dignity, morality, responsiblity, and hope.51 The death-bed message of Sarah Schenirer, spoken in Cracow in 1935, conveys this thought:52 My dear girls, you are going out into the great world. Your task is to plant the holy seed in the souls of pure children. In a sense, the destiny of Israel of old is in your hands. Be strong and of good courage. Don't tire. Don't slacken your efforts. You have heard of a Hasid who came to his rabbi and said joyfully, "Rabbi, I have finished the whole Talmud." "What has the Talmud taught you?" asked the rabbi. "Your learning is fine, but your practical task is the main thing."53 Let me complete these words with verses you all know so well. ^he significance of the Ninety-Three for religious life in Eretz Israel is voiced by several authors in a Hebrew publication, 93 (Tel Aviv, Iyar 1943), which sees in their martyrdom a negation of exile and a recommitment to love of Zion. The latter is directed to the Daughters of Israel and expressed in traditional categories of womanly modesty and behavior. For more on the effect of the Ninety-Three on the yishuv , and questions on the letter's validity, see Judith Tydor Baumol essay on the story of the Ninety-Three Maidens (n.d.), obtainable from the Yafta Eiach Collection of the Center for Holocaust Studies, Brooklyn, New York. 51Cf. the remarks of Elie Wiesel before some 1600 survivors gathered at Manhattan's Marriot Marquis Hotel for the MFirst International Gathering of Children Hidden During World War II": "Continue not only to foce [your past] and cope with it, but also share it.

May the Lord guard your going out and your coming in now and forever more. May He listen to our prayers and send us the true redeemer and true redemption. The continuation of the Beit Ya'akov movement is Sarah Schenirer's Kaddish; but her comforting words to live Jewishly (religiously) and not despairingly may well be taken as the proper Kaddish by the living for the brutally murdered Jewish nation. It is the charge to ahavat yisrael , this Letter of the Ninety-Three Maidens, which transcends time and clime, and confronts the generations after Auschwitz with the "living" message of the dead. Their Kaddish becomes an act of doing, not just an exercise in remembering.54 *In his phone conversation to me (February 20, 1990), Mr. Schenkolewsky emphatically insisted that he met Chaya Feldman and can recall her disposition but not her face.
