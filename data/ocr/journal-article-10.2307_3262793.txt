<plain_text><page sequence="1">SECOND MILLENNIUM ANTECEDENTS TO THE HEBREW 'OB HARRY A. HOFFNER, JR. BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY IN 1961 Professor Maurice Vieyra first called to the attention of the scholarly world the existence of extrabiblical parallels in Hittite and Assyrian to the ritual pit called the MiN in the OT.' He explained that the ritual pit appearing in Hittite texts under the names a-a-pi, hat- tessar, ASRU (literally, "place"), TIUL, and BUR(U) served the purpose of providing a means of presenting sacrifices to the chthonic deities, who are known in these texts by the name of karuiles siunes or katteres siunes ("former deities" and "infernal deities" respectively). He further adduced evidence for the existence of similar pits in early Roman,2 Greek,3 Assyr- ian,4 and Sumerians religion. The terms employed to designate these pits in the various languages are by no means all cognate to one another, but Vieyra was able to show that a large degree of probability exists for deriving the Sumerian, Assyrian, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Hebrew terms from a common source.6 The chart below illustrates the similarity in sound shared by these various terms: Sumerian ab(.'ll),7 Hittite a-a-bi, 8 Ugaritic 'eb,9 Assyrian abu,Io Hebrew '6b (3:1).T "Les noms du 'mundus' en hittite et en assyrien et la pythonisse d'Endor," Revue Hittite et Asianique, fasc. 69 (1961), pp. 47-55. 2The Roman mundus was such a pit, an official installation in Rome near the Comitia.

Before one can posit any theory as to the manner in which the hypo- thetical common source word for the five technical terms listed above developed phonetically into each of the target languages one must seek to be positive as to the exact pronunciation of these five words them- selves. In particular, the Hittite and Ugaritic terms require some comment. The difficulty posed by the Hittite spellings is the pronuncia- tion required by the writing with initial double a (i. e., a-a-). There are three current phonetic interpretations of the cuneiform spelling a-a: (1) Friedrich in his HWbI2 "normalizes" these forms with a (i. e., long a); (2) Landsberger reads them as a'a;13 and GoetzeI4 and von SodenI5 read them as ay or ayy(a/i/u). Friedrich's interpretation is the least accept- able), although unfortunately most Hittitologists (perhaps hypnotized by the HWb) tend to follow his example in transcribing Hittite words with a-a. This interpretation fits neither Hittite nor Hurrian phonology which cannot be shown to have possessed a consistent means of marking vowel length orthographically. No attempt has ever been made to justify this interpretation of the a-a spellings by an appeal to Akkadian texts. I would not presume to criticize Landsberger's interpretation of the Assyriological evidence for a-a, but it has always seemed to me that the use of these spellings in Hittite texts cannot be understood as indicat- ing glottal catch (aleph). No one has ever demonstrated that Hittite possessed a glottal catch phoneme, but the y phoneme is universally recognized. The normalization *ay(a)bi, then, seems preferable to either *abi or *a'abi. An additional advantage to this normalization will be seen next, as we consider the Ugaritic form. The Ugaritic term which contains a linguistic counterpart to Hittite- Hurrian *ay(a)bi is transcribed ilib in the Ugaritic Textbook of C. H. Gordon,'6 although the first and third signs of the word could equally well be transcribed 'e, since this sign can represent glottal catch followed by either the i or e vowel. Gordon does not discuss the matter of whether short i at Ugarit was ever pronounced e, but he does acknowledge that 12 Page 26. 13 B.

It would thus be possible to understand the second part of this word as deriving from *ayb(i). As for the meaning of ilib, UT remarks as follows on skn ilib: "designates a religious stela of some sort."'8 The term ilib also occurs as a god's name (UT 17:14; 2004:5). The following passage from the Aqhat Tale is fundamental for the inter- pretation of ilib. UT: 2 Aqht 1:26-29 (= Corpus 19 1:26-29): wykn . bnh bbt "(So) shall there be his son in the house, SrS . bqrb (27) hklh a scion in the midst of his palace nsb . skn . ilibh who erects the stela(e) of his ilib, bqds (28) ztr . cmh . in the holy place the ztr of his ancestor(s), lars . mssu . qtrh who from the ground causes his qtr to go forth, (29) lcpr . dmrr . atrh from the earth the dmr of his 'place.' " It is not my purpose here to attempt a thorough exegesis of this passage. But a few details might be noted. First, the ilib itself is not necessarily a stela or a "memorial monument."19 It is the skn which is erected (nsb). This skn is then described (or further defined) as the "skn of his ilib." The above arrangement of lines must be retained against that proposed by Aistleitner-Eissfeldt in WUS1,20 since only this arrange- ment allows the majority of the lines in the larger context to consist of three members each. Thus (contra WUS) ztr cmh is parallel to either skn ilibh or ilibh by itself, but not to mssu qtrh. Neither UT nor WUS propose a semitic cognate for ztr. Taking my clue from Vieyra, I would understand ilib (or *'il'eb) as "spirit of/from the pit." The term 'eb (from *aybi) designates the ritual pit or mundus (to use the Latin term) from which by means of sacrifices and spells one may elicit the spirit of the deceased. The use of il to designate the spirit of the deceased recalls the words of the witch of En-dor in I Sam 28 13-14 when describing the apparition of Samuel emerging from the ritual pit: "I see gods (or 'a god'?) coming up out of the ground... an old man is coming up, and he I7 UT, p. 19.

Some of the Hittite evidence is relevant here as well, since the word a-a-bi occurs sometimes with the DINGIR deter- minative, even when the impersonal pit itself is in view (KUB VII 41++ iii 13, 16, 17; KUB X 63 obv i 18, 20, 24; etc.). In addition a deity is known from KUB VII 41++ obv i 52, ii 19, and iii 33 whose name is spelled dA-a-bi. That he is actually a deity (personal) is shown by his grouping with others of the karuiles siunes, such as Aduntarri, Zulki, Erbitiga, Nara, Napsara, Minki, and Amunki, all of whom are Hurrian deities. It is thus likely that Ay(a)bi is Hurrian. If Ugaritic 'eb is from original *'ayb(i), then we must rule out Al- bright's thesis that original *ibu (preserved in Ugaritic, according to him) became *ubu in South Canaanite under the influence of the labial, and that this latter vocalization explains Hebrew :iN.21 The o-vowel in the Hebrew noun must be considered as a reflex of either a pure long a-vowel affected by the "Canaanite shift" or accented short a following the Phoenician pattern.22 It will be best to approach the vocalization of 31 through the neo-Assyrian form abu. For a discussion of the meaning of Assyrian abu see Vieyra.23 Goetze has formulated the rule that Akkadian words with initial aya in Old Babylonian become first ya and then a in neo-Assyrian.24 Hence Old Babylonian *ayabum became first *yabu and then abu during the Middle and Neo-Assyrian periods. It would be impossible to derive Hebrew Mil from the neo-Assyrian abu, however, since the Hebrew (rather South Canaanite) term together with its frequent associate '3y.' is obviously quite old and goes back at least to the time of Saul. The term has to be old enough in Canaanite for there to have occurred the semantic development from "pit" to "spirit of the pit" to "spirit" by the end of the biblical period. The usage of such pits for necromancy (if the Aqhat passage is correctly interpreted) is at home on Canaanite soil since the late second millennium B. C. The term MiM must, therefore, have derived from the Hurrians themselves, who were present in enclaves of non-Semitic peoples on South Palestinian soil since the Amarna Age. Among these people the original term *ayabi had undergone the change to *'ob. But the stages and rationale behind the transformation are not clear. Vieyra assumes that the prototype of all the other terms was the Sumerian ab.25 But if we accept Goetze's normalization of Hittite a-a-bi as *ay(a)bi and my understanding of Ugaritic ib as *'eb (from *'ayb), the derivation of a Hurrian *ay(a)bi from Sumerian ab is phonetically 21 Archaeology and the Religion of Israel3, p. 203, n. 31. 22 Z.

In this writer's opinion, it is better either to consider all of these terms as ursprachliches Residuum of an old substratum term (I borrow this terminology and viewpoint from Professor Landsberger), or (if one of the extant languages must be the source) to accept the Hurrian *ay(a)bi as the prototype. In my opinion it is even doubtful that the Sumerian ab belongs in the same group with the other four terms. In order to facilitate the second phase of this essay - namely, the elucidation of the modus operandi for the *ay(a)bi pits, as described in Hittite, Greek, Assyrian, and Hebrew texts (the Ugaritic has already been discussed above) - I should like to transliterate and translate the selec- tion of source texts and mark them with numbers. This will enable me to refer to them later with utmost brevity and convenience. 1. Hittite: KUB XXIX 4 rev iv 31-36 (Relocation of Black Goddess; cf.

And I earnestly en- treated the powerless heads of the dead, vowing that.... But when with vows and prayers I had made supplication to the tribes of the dead (WOvea pEKpop), I took the sheep and cut their throats over the pit, and the dark blood ran forth. Then there gathered from out of Erebus the spirits of those that are dead.... These came thronging in crowds about the pit from every side, with a wondrous cry (OET7rEota iaX-); and pale fear seized me." 9. Assyrian: KAR 146; Assyrian royal ritual. (Only a synopsis of the proceedings is given here with citations of selected passages.) After making food offerings to the Lisikutu deities and singing a hymn, the ndru- singer takes the food offerings and drops them into the abu (ina libbi abi ikarrar) and pours on top of them honey, oil, beer, and wine. Then the ndru fills up the pit (Ltndru abu umalla), and the king places his foot on top of the pit. Next the king bends down and kisses the ground and then goes straight back to the palace. In a variant version the king goes from the pit to the akitu-house. On the basis of this and parallel passages Vieyra has shown that von Soden's AHw entries on apu must be revised to: apu (I) "R6hricht," and apu (II) "Loch." 10.

Based upon a comparison of the above ten passages concerning the use of ritual pits for the consultation with or veneration of the dead and the infernal deities, along with the passages from the Hebrew Bible, the following remarks can be made as to the modus operandi: 392</page><page sequence="9">HOFFNER: ANTECEDENTS TO HEBREW 'OB 1) The time of day at which the sacrifices were made and the spirits sought was a matter of considerable importance. Guthrie26 tells us that a principal difference between the sacrifices made to the Olympian deities and the chthonioi was that, whereas the former were performed in the bright morning sunshine, the latter were carried out in the dead of night. In text 1 the protocol specifies that the ritual is to be performed at night (nekuz mehur) under the stars. We are not informed in the Gil- gamesh Epic passage (text 10) what time of day it was when Nergal opened up the pit for the return of Enkidu's spirit. In text 2 the priest draws the deity up from the a-a-bi early in the morning (man lukkatta, ii 14) before the sun had arisen sufficiently to disperse the grey. In text 8 there is no particular need to specify time of day, since Odysseus is in the land of the sun's setting, where flows Oceanus which bounds the earth and where is the land of the Cimmerians, wrapt in mist and cloud. "Never does the bright sun look down on them with its rays either when it mounts the starry heaven or when it turns again to earth from heaven, but baneful night is spread over wretched mortals" (Odyssey XI, 15-19). In this regard it is quite significant that in I Sam 28 8 we are told that Saul came to the witch of En-dor at night (ni ,.). It must be admitted that the king did not wish to be conspicuous at the time of this visit. But the disguise which he wore would have been sufficient by itself, had not other factors favored a nocturnal interview. These factors are the very same which dictated that the Hittite rituals be carried out at night and that the chthonioi be worshiped at night. 2) Before the sacrificial pit could be dug, the practitioner had to determine a propitious spot. The value of propitious spots for acts of sorcery is, of course, clearly demonstrated (in the OT) in the Balaam narrative. Like the Mesopotamian baru or Sumerian azu, Balaam had to make several attempts to find just the right location in order to insure the success of his execrations (Num 23 1-2, 13-14, 27-30). The Hittite text 3 informs us that even the number of the pits to be dug was subject to the will of the deity as manifested in oracle responses. In some cases, if the spirit sought were a deceased mortal, the most propitious location for the orifice might be near his grave. The tombs at Ras Shamra which have small tunnels connecting the crypts with the surface of the ground are probably related to this practice.27 Unrelated to sacrificial pits but manifesting the same general concept is the hole in the lid of the gigantic sarcophagus of Ashurnasirpal II.28 Similar "vents" were a standard feature in the funerary monuments of the Egyptian pharaohs. One cannot be positive, but there is a possibility that the bqds of 2 Aqht 1:27 ("who erects the stela(e) of his ilib, in the holy place the ztr of his 26 The Greeks and their Gods, p. 222. 28 E. A. Speiser in A NET, p. 98, n. 253. 27 Vieyra, op. cit., p. 53. 393</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE ancestor") refers to the sacred spot selected for the ritual pit, hard by a stela to mark it. And just as Vieyra has shown that the Akkadogram asru ("place") indicates the ritual pit in Hittite texts on occasion, so in the same Aqhat text the revenant (called qtr "smokelike apparition" in line 28) is designated as dmr atrh ("guardian of his 'place' ") in line 29. This spirit is evoked "from the ground" (lars and lcpr). No mention is made in I Samuel 28 of the witch's activities in locating a proper spot for the pit. But since, as we shall soon see, the pits were sealed with sacri- ficial loaves or covered with cloths so that they might subsequently be re-used, it is not impossible that this woman lived in the vicinity of such a propitious spot which she had many an occasion to use for her clients. This might also explain the expression ir3-n_. ("she who possesses an :li") as the designation of the woman - that is, she alone had access to this particular sacred orifice. 3) The pit could be dug with any appropriate instrument. In Hit- tite text 3 a hoe (Sumerian al) is employed first, followed by the use of a silver pectoral ornament (Akkadian tudittum). In text 1, on the other hand, two specially prepared daggers (Sumerian gir) are used to open the pit, as is also the case in text 6. The latter instances are of interest, because it is a sword which Odysseus uses to open his pit in text 8. The use of the sword, the daggers, and the pectoral as variants to the more prosaic hoe must point to some underlying symbolism which was im- portant to the effectiveness of the rite. Just what that symbolism is (though transparent to the ancients themselves) must remain a matter of opinion and debate to the modern scholar. 4) Into the pit food offerings were lowered. An alternative (occa- sionally supplementary) practice was to arrange them around the mouth of the pit(s), presumably to entice the spirits up out of the pit to eat and drink. Such enticements were not always confined in their usage to the chthonioi or even to the pits. In Hittite rituals of the evocatio type (for a representative ritual in English translation see A. Goetze in ANET, pp. 351-53) such appealing foodstuffs were a principal means of luring the absent gods back to their temples. In the Odyssey passage (text 8) in addition to the libations of honeyed milk, wine, and water, a food offering of white barley meal was poured into the pit. The Hit- tite passages show that loaves of bread, cheese, butter, and GA.KU7 (usually translated "sweet milk," but perhaps "honeyed milk" like the Odyssey's EXtLKpTlroV in this context) accompanied the libations. The late Assyrian ritual mentions "food offerings" but fails to specify the items. 5) There is general unanimity among the various texts as to the liquids used for libation. The Odyssey mentions honeyed milk, sweet wine, and water. The Hittite texts include sweet (honeyed?) milk, oil, honey, wine, and beer. The Assyrian ritual names honey, beer, and wine. The conspicuous place which honey occupies in these rituals is note- 394</page><page sequence="11">HOFFNER: ANTECEDENTS TO HEBREW 'OB worthy, especially since in early Hebrew ritual law worshipers were forbidden to mix honey with any of their offerings to God (Lev 2 11). 6) But the beverage which these denizens of the underworld craved more than honey, beer, and wine was the blood of sacrificial animals. In the Odyssey the offerer cuts the sheep's throat over the pit and allows the blood to run down into the hole. The Hittite rituals reveal three distinct ways of handling the blood. In text 1 it is allowed to run down into the pit in the same fashion as the Odyssey passage (text 8). The sacrificial animal is actually lowered into the pit before its throat is cut.29 In text 3 the blood is spattered around the mouth of the pit(s) in order to lure the spirits up. In text 5 the clearest evidence appears that the blood was regarded as a beverage for the deity or spirit. The sheep's blood is drained off into a goblet which is then placed on the ground before the cult image of the deity. In Odyssey XI, 48-50, 140-154 we are informed that all of the spirits in Hades which come up from the pits wish to drink of the sacrificial blood and that only when they have so drunk can they recognize the loved one who has solicited their appear- ance. Thus even Odysseus' own mother does not recognize him until she has drunk from the blood which he has with him. The OT passages concerned with liR do not make reference to the spirits drinking the blood of sacrifices, although this is not an unreasonable assumption. 7) Other gifts not intended as food were also lowered into the pit. Substitute images made of colored wool, women's headdress, woolen gloves, silver models of the human ear, silver pectoral ornaments, and even a shekel of lump silver are dropped or hung down into the pits. The choice of silver rather than gold, copper, tin, lead, or iron as the metal out of which gifts to the chthonioi are fashioned is evident in all of the texts. One can only suppose that popular superstition dictated this metal as the only proper one, just as in European superstition from a much later period a silver knife or a silver bullet were the only kinds effective in the slaying of werewolves and other monstrous creatures of popular fantasy. 8) The object of the ritual was to lure the spirit or deity up out of the pit. The Hittite rituals do not specify the exact reasons for bringing the deities up. The passage from the Gilgamesh Epic cited as text 10 is followed by the record of an interview between the spirit of Enkidu and the god Nergal. "They embraced and kissed each other. They exchanged counsel, sighing at each other: 'Tell me, my friend, tell me, my friend, tell me the order of the nether world which thou hast seen' " (Gilgamesh, Tabl. XII, 85-88; translation of Speiser in ANET, p. 98). It has long been believed in OT circles that the significance of the term 29 Compare Guthrie's remarks about the sacrifices to the chthonioi in The Greeks and their Gods, p. 221. 395</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE '.:y', if it does not refer to the skill or knowledge of the black arts mani- fested by the practitioner, refers to the knowledgeable spirits of the under- world. Certainly Saul's declared reason for seeking an interview with Samuel's ghost is information (I Sam 28 15). Several centuries later Isaiah mocked such practitioners in words which must have been pro- verbial among the prophets of God who had been attacking this un- orthodox rite for over a century: "Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?" (Isa 8 19). The prophets also (though in mocking tone) accurately reflect the use of ritual pits in the ground for bringing up the ghosts with words such as these: "Then deep from the earth you shall speak, from low in the dust your words shall come; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust" (Isa 29 4). Hittite text 2 makes it clear that both the practitioner and the client acted to bring the deity up. It is possible that in text 2 something very concrete is in view, namely, the hauling up of the cult statue from the pit, but it cannot be denied that such analogic forms were intended to solicit the presence of the living deity as well. The bait which was used to lure the deities or spirits up was the sacrificial blood and other food offerings. But other imple- ments are also mentioned. In text 7 there is a slight problem in the reading of line 12. The deity is drawn up seven times with NINDhazzi- zitaza. The form is an ablative of the noun hazzizi(ta)- which in turn is a loan into Hittite via Hurrian from Akkadian hasSsu "understanding; ear" (CAD H, p. 126; AHw, p. 330). On the basis of this passage (in- cluding lines 18 and 23 as well) both the CAD (sub hasistu with erroneous reference to KBo II 8 ii 12 and 13!) and the AHw (sub hasisztu with omission of line 12) assume that an original Akkadian bread name has either been loaned via Hurrian into Hittite (CAD), or is used in Hittite texts as an Akkadogram (so apparently AHw). Yet (as E. Laroche has confided in me in personal correspondence) on the basis of this text alone there is reason to doubt the reading NINDAhazzizita(za) and to consider as equally plausible 4 hazzizita(za), since the GAR sign in cuneiform can be the numeral 4 as well as the NINDA determinative. Happily the existence of NINDAhazzizi(ta) no longer rests entirely upon this passage, since the publication of the building ritual KBo XV 24, where the following evidence is found: (1) ha-zi-zi SA NINDA i-ya-an. "ear(s) of bread (are) made" (iii 3), (2) 10 NINDAha-zi-zi (with numeral before the NINDA sign!) is mentioned in iii 6, (3) 1 NINDAha-zi-zi can be restored for iii 29, 32, and 35. In view of this confirmatory evidence, it is unnecessary any longer to doubt the reading NNDAhazzizita(za) in KBo II 9 iv 12, 18 and 23 (our passage). It appears then that ear-shaped loaves were used (text 7) to draw up the deity. The choice of an ear- shaped loaf is paralleled by the silver ear suspended from the pectoral ornament in text 3. Perhaps this symbolizes the willingness (eagerness) 396</page><page sequence="13">HOFFNER: ANTECEDENTS TO HEBREW 'OB of the offerer to hear from the deity or spirit and the desire of the offerer that the netherworld will hear his supplication. Compare the passage from the prayer to the sun goddess of the netherworld (KBo VII 28 i 11-13): "Incline your good eyes, lift up your thousand eyelids and gaze benevolently upon the king. Incline your ears and hear his good word(s)." Another quaint feature of one of the Hittite texts (3) is the mention of a silver ladder which was lowered into the pit. The size of the ladder is not stated, so that we do not know whether it is a mere model or a full-size ladder which was propped up against the wall of the pit to aid the deity in his ascent. The material (silver) perhaps favors the assumption that the ladder was only a model. Yet, as in the case of the model ears, it is the symbolism which is vital, and here there can certainly be no room for difference of opinion as to the meaning of the symbolism! As the ear communicates the desire of the offerer(s) for a "hearing" with the deity, so the ladder communicates an invitation to come up and out of the pit. This tantalizing bit of information provides a basis for a profitable com- parison with the famous ladder which Jacob saw in his dream at Bethel (Gen 28 10-17). In this dream the patriarch saw a ladder (MID) set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. "And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the Lord stood above it" (Gen 28 12-13). When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.... How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God! This is the gate of heaven!" (Gen 28 16-17). Bethel was an awesome place, because (like the locations of the a-a-bi/ miR1) it was one of the few spots known where intercommunication from one level of the three- storied cosmos to the others was possible. As deities might use a ladder to ascend from the netherworld to the surface of the earth, so might angels use a ladder to go back and forth from earth to heaven! We must not be misled by modern rationalistic considerations into discarding this ancient image for a ziggurat stairway, simply because it would be easier for angels to pass each other going up and down on a stairway than on a ladder! If this type of rationalization is pursued to its logical conclusion, there would be no need for a ladder or stairway at all! For why would angels need one? I stress this point, because the late Professor E. A. Speiser, a truly gifted Orientalist, argued for interpreting Genesis 28 in this fashion in his stimulating commentary on Genesis in the Anchor Bible (pp. 218-20), and has thus popularized this interpretation.30 His 30 Nor can Speiser's etymological analysis of Hebrew OD? on p. 218 of Genesis as derived from the root 0D go unchallenged, even if this analysis is shared by BDB, p. 700b and Gesenius-Buhl, HAT, p. 545b. None of these older Hebrew dictionaries could be expected to know of the Akkadian cognate simmiltu, though Speiser might have been expected to. Since we are confronted with an obvious case of metathesis, but cannot with certainty say which form is the more primitive, it stands to reason that 397</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE interpretation, in my opinion, is invalid even if consideration is given only to the OT passage itself. The ziggurat stairways were used by priests ascending to the summit, where worship was carried out. The deities did not use them to descend to the ground level. On the other hand, the symbolism of text 3 makes it quite clear that the deity or deities invoked from the netherworld were intended to ascend via the ladder to the upper world. 9) When the deity or spirit finally appeared, what were its sensory manifestations? The Odyssey passage gives the distinct impression that the form was clearly anthropomorphic and recognizable to the living loved one. Odysseus recognizes his mother and his old friends when he sees them. The Odyssey passage also mentions "crowds" (oi roXXoi) and "nations" (EOvea) of the dead which throng the sacrifices. In the Gil- gamesh Epic (text 10) Enkidu's spirit is called a zaqlqu "a phantom, or gust of wind." The CAD rejects the translation "wind" for zaqiqu and points out that the term is always used of ghostly phenomena of a super- natural nature. The word accordingly denotes something very close to our modern Western image of a specter. The appearance of Samuel to the woman of En-dor was clearly a terrifying sight. When she first saw him, she emitted a shriek, And when Saul had succeeded in calming her and asked her to describe what she had seen, she said: "I see gods (per- haps 'a god' here) coming up out of the earth... An old man is coming up and he is wrapped in a robe" (I Sam 28 13-14). The returned spirit is able to communicate to the client, but in a voice which is both eerie and supernatural. Enkidu's first words are described as "sighing" (Akkadian anahu).3' The spirits which throng the pit of Odysseus utter a "super- natural cry" (0eaoreairy laXi). Isaiah describes their utterances by the Hebrew participle t'.E)9.X. , which elsewhere is employed only for describing the sounds made by birds (8 19, 29 4).32 To judge from the prophet's words, the practitioners in Judah elicited sounds from the open pit itself, since he says, "Your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust" (29 4). It seems that one of the standard features of cultic activity directed toward the dead was the whisper. Other Hittite rituals which belong to the genre of texts called Totenrituale ("funerary rituals") frequently mention the whispering of the priests (the verb is hustesk-, on which see H. Otten, Hethitische Totenrituale, p. 148 with references). 10) Finally, it was necessary after the spirit had returned to the netherworld to seal up the hole. Perhaps it was a precautionary measure to insure that the spirits might not be allowed to roam the upper world indiscriminately. In the Gilgamesh Epic, when Shamash at first is we cannot be permitted to treat the m, which in the Hebrew form is final, as a formative element. 31 E. A. Speiser in A NET, p. 98, n. 255. 32 BDB, p. 861b. 398</page><page sequence="15">HOFFNER: ANTECEDENTS TO HEBREW 'OB reluctant to grant Ishtar's request to release the bull of heaven on Enkidu and Gilgamesh, the goddess threatens to "smash the doors of the netherworld and raise up the dead eating and alive, so that the dead will outnumber the living" (Tabl. VI, 96 ff.). All sorts of harmful forces from the netherworld might be released upon mankind if the points of exit were not properly guarded and sealed off. In a few Hittite texts we are given a glimpse of the netherworld as a place in which bronze caul- drons are set with lids of lead. Into these cauldrons are banished all sorts of evils which are then kept in by the lead lids.33 What would be the plight of mankind if these evils were ever released from their under- world "Pandora's box"! In the neo-Assyrian ritual (text 9) the ndru- singer refills the pit, apparently with loose soil. In the Hittite text 5 the pit is sealed at the top with loaves of sacrificial bread, and in Hittite text 6 it is covered with a cloth, a fragile but apparently effective lid! 11) W. K. C. Guthrie34 has assembled a short list of contrasts between the modus operandi for the worship of the chthonioi and that of the Olym- pians. It will be profitable for us to compare this material with what we have learned from these oriental texts. (1) "Name for the act of sacrifice: Ovetv for the Olympians, evayItLtv for the chthonians." There is no specialized term in Hittite texts for sacrifice to the katteres SiuneS vs. the gods of heaven. Nor is this apparently the case in the Hebrew, Ugaritic, or Akkadian texts either. (2) "Method: animal killed with throat upward for Olympians, downward for chthonians (so that blood may most easily soak into the earth)." The Hittite texts make no overt mention of the position of the animal's throat, although (as we noted above) the animal itself was on occasions lowered into the pit before cutting its throat, so that the blood might flow into the ground. (3) "Type of altar: for Olympians the high-built /w3j6s, for the chthon- ians a low altar called eoxapa (hearth), or else no altar at all, but the sacrifice performed into a pit or trench (30Opos)." Here the parallel is most obvious, since the use of the 1iR, a-a-bi, or abu is found through- out the Near East and Asia Minor. The high-built altar, used for astral deities was called the =3? in Hebrew, istananas in Hittite, manzdzu in Akkadian. (4) "Choice of victim: (a) Colour - for Olympians white, for chthonians black... (b) Species. The ram is the usual offering to the chthonians, also the pig, which had particular associations with sacrifices of expiations and purification ... The ox which was commonly offered to the Olympians was absent. It may be added that as well as animal victims 'bloodless offerings,' e. g. of honey or the fruits of the earth, were commonly made to the powers of the earth." As to color, 33 First version of Telepinu Myth, A iv 15 ff. (RHA f. 77, pp. 96 f.), and Disap- pearance of dMAH, A ii 5 ff. (RHA f. 77, pp. 138 f.). A discussion of these two passages and their relevance to the correlation of Hittite tarpis with Hebrew D'.n.l will be found in (forthcoming) JNES, 27 (1968). 34 Op. cit., pp. 221 f. 399</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE the same distinction between white animals for astral deities and black ones for chthonioi is made rather consistently in the Hittite texts. Thus, when the Hurrian hero of the Hittite Appu myth wishes to take an offering to the sun god of heaven, he brings a "white lamb" (KUB XXIV 8+, i 38-40). When, on the other hand, in the ritual of Pupu- wanni (KUB VII 2+, i 19-21) the sacrificer wishes to appeal to the powers of the nether regions (dankuis daganzipas, line 23), he selects a time before sunrise (lukkatta dUTU-us-kan nawi uizzi, line 19) and assembles the following items for sacrifice and offering: "five loaves of sacrificial bread weighing a tarnas each, vessels of beer, one black puppy, one black lamb, one black kid" (lines 20-21). Color specifications are absent from the ritual laws regarding lambs, kids, goats, sheep and oxen in the OT with the exception of the red heifer of Numbers 19. In the Mycenaean tablets offering lists reveal no color specifications for animal sacrifices, but do specific sex.35 Even in the tablets discussed by Ventris and Chadwick in ch. 7 and not considered to be offering lists there is no apparent notation of color for the animals, although sex and other matters are clearly noted.36 The distinction that female animals should be given to goddesses and male ones to gods does seem to be observed also in the Hittite offering lists and ritual texts. Thus in KUB XXIX 1 rev iii 22-23 when the builders have laid the foundation stones of the new palace, they sacrifice a bull to the storm god and a cow to the sun goddess of Arinna; and in KUB XXIX 7 rev 58 the animal sacrifice for the queen is a ewe, while that of the king is a bull. Because Israel's monotheism was male-oriented, the male animals were more valuable for sacrifice, even though any herdsman knows that it is easier to part with excess male animals than with the females, which are valuable for breeding. As to the species of the animal, Hittite texts reveal that, like the Greeks, the Hittites considered the pig to be an animal par- ticularly appropriate as a sacrifice to the infernal powers.37 In this category the Hittites also placed the dog.38 We have already seen above that honey and the fruits of the earth were in fact also dropped into the ritual pits. Guthrie also adds contrasts as to type of shrine, time of day, and the gesture in prayer, but we have already commented on these matters in the earlier parts of the study. In summation, let me focus all of this collateral information upon the new understanding of the OT liW. We are indebted to Vieyra for bringing to our attention the Hittite, Ugaritic, Assyrian, and Sumerian parallels to the Hebrew niR. He sought to show that the 31 was (like the a-a-bi) 35 Ventris and Chadwick, Documents in Mycenaean Greek, ch. 9. 36Op. cit., ch. 7. 37 E. von Schuler, Die Kaskder, p. 77 with n. 80. 38 Ibid.; also A. Goetze, Kleinasien2, p. 164. 400</page><page sequence="17">HOFFNER: ANTECEDENTS TO HEBREW 'OB a ritual pit for communication with the netherworld. He also proposed that Hebrew :iN, Ugaritic ib, Assyrian abu, and Hurro-Hittite a-a-bi were derived from Sumerian ab.39 In the first point Vieyra acknowledges that he was anticipated by C. J. Gadd, Ideas of Divine Rule in the Ancient East, pp. 88 f. But going beyond Gadd, Vieyra posits Hurro-Hittite a-a-bi as the intermediary link linguistically between Sumerian ab and Hebrew MiK. We have sought here to add the following: (1) Bring to bear the objections of Goetze4o to the normalization of a-a-bi as *dbi and suggest the phonetic laws which might account for the passage of Hurro- Hittite a-a-bi (*ayabi) into Ugaritic ib (*'ebu), Assyrian abu, and Hebrew MiN. (2) Assemble all of the relevant Hittite passages mentioning the a-a-bi together with the Greek, Ugaritic, Assyrian, and Sumerian, and utilize their information to reconstruct a collective modus operandi for these pits. It has not been my intention thereby to suggest that all of these elements of modus would have been present in any isolated instance, but only to show the entire range of possible actions which enter into the manipulations at the pits. It is my understanding that the M1i was primarily a ritual hole in the ground dug to give infernal deities or spirits of the deceased access to the upper world for a brief interval of time. Officiating at such a pit would be a woman (or on occasions perhaps also a man) called the zliK'n_3 ("possessor of a pit"). She would be visited at night and under the proper conditions she would unseal such a pit and elicit the spirit(s) from it, perhaps using food offerings of the type em- ployed in the Greek and Hittite sources. When the interview was com- pleted, she would reseal the pit with loose soil, sacrificial loaves, or even a cloth. This would keep the spirits from gaining unsupervised access again to the upper world until she had occasion to visit the spot again with a client. In time the name which at first designated only the pit itself came to be applied to the spirits which issued from it, just as in the Hittite texts we see that a deity exists with the name dA-a-bi, and that the determinative for deity is sometimes written, even when no personal deity is in view. Thus the nli:t of the prophets are the spirits them- selves, and can be paired with the 'T1. There is not likely to be any opportunity for archeological evidence to support this thesis, since such simple holes in the ground (most of them doubtless located outside the walls of the settlements!) would leave no appreciable traces. The word itself need not be of Hurrian origin, as indicated above. It may be an old substratum word whose ultimate linguistic affiliation is forever lost to us. What is reasonably certain, however, is that the evidence for similarity of function reinforces the approximate phonetic similarity in such a way as to assure us that Hebrew lRN, Ugaritic ib, Hurro-Hittite a-a-bi, Assyrian abu, and possibly even Sumerian ab, are all variants of the same word. 40 See above in n. 24. 401 39 Op. cit., p. 52.</page></plain_text>
