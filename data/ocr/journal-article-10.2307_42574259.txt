IN sents Literature, a most Philosophy erudite justification , and the ofjjie. Imagination, hmnanities. Levi He pre- is sents a most erudite justification ofjjie. hmnanities. He is concerned with the dualism that has plagued philosophy since the beginning of the conflict between the natural sciences and the humanities ; more especially, he is concerned with the con- flicting views of man that the two disciplines suggest. His starting point is the philosophy of Kant and Kant's treatment of the scientific understanding in his Critique of Pure Reason and of the humanistic imagination in his Critique of Judg- ment. Levi's point is that "understanding" and "imagination" are two separate functions of the cognitive needs of man, and 396</page><page sequence="2">SEPTEMBER 1966 BOOK REVIEWS that "essentially the purposes of the two enterprises are dif- ferent, and they are grounded respectively in the nuclear oper- ations of the understanding and the imagination." He finds understanding (or science) and imagination (or the humani- ties) basiçalL)Ljjj££Qndlable. The "chain of understanding" is concerned with matters of fact and a reliance on the prin- ciple _of ^causation, whereas the "humanistic complex" is anthropomorphic and is concerned with teleology and drama. Levi carefully documents his disagreement with the posi- tivists' view of man and his relation to the world of natural phenomena. (In fact, his documentation is so thorough that it presents an excellent summary of modern philosophical thought.) He sees this view as one which is primarily "value- less" when compared with the "propensity toward teleologica! interpretation" which man inherently has and which is re- flected in the humanities. It is the imagination which is con- cerned with "purposiveness" and "drama" in life. Drawing from Santayana and Gilbert Ryle, Levi suggests that to meet his cognitive needs, man needs two maps of reality. However, despite the similarities which may seem to exist between the two "maps," they are composed of different vocabularies which are addressed to entirely different prob- lems. Levi gives an interesting scheme of the confrontation of the two language maps: The Scientific Chain of Meaning (The Language of the U nderstanding ) "True" and "false" propositions. The problem of "error." "Causality" and "scientific law." "Prediction" and "chance." "Fact" - "matter of fact." "Competition" - "biological growth." The "stasis" or "equilibrium" of systems. The Humanistic Complex (The Language of the Imagination ) "Reality" and "appearance." The problem of "illusion." "Destiny" and "human purpose." "Fate" and "fortune." "Drama" and "the dramatic event." "Tragedy." "Peace." For example, the scientist is concerned with the truth and falsity of propositions, the poet with the appearances and 397</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIII, NO. 3 realities^ of the world, and so the problem that one deals with under the rubric of " 'error," the other must consider under the heading of "illusion." For Levi, an empirical approach to all the problems of the "human condition" is an unsatisfactory one: It largely ignores man's tremendous drive to find purpose and drama in his existence. He says that the imagination develops a metaphysics, though not a mysticism, which makes life bearable. It is through the imagination that man expresses his sense of purposiveness and drama in lifer and the attempts of many philosophers to find the same attributes in a scientific or empirical system are unconvincing. This thesis is developed throughout the book by the analyses of a very large number of important works of literature. The student of general semantics will find much^thatlie may armie with in Levi's presen taf i on At tfiïTsame time, he willTmd much that is provocative. The dualism that Levi pre- sents is oneTHaTls still pertinent. Alton A. Hobgood San Francisco State College</page></plain_text>
