<plain_text><page sequence="1">Non-Human Thought. Jacques Graven. 223pp. $5.95. Stein and Day Publishers, 7 East 48th Street, New York 10017. First edition, 1967. This modern "bestiary"—translated from the French—is anthropomorphism run riot. The very title, Non-Human Thought, is paradoxical and therefore bewildering. Ac tually, the "thought" in this book is the author's. He reviews the literature on ani mal behavior, feeling free to ascribe to animals—and even to plants—every nuance of human consciousness. Witness these ex amples of sectional headings: Seduction, Some Mysteries of Love, Strange Lovers, Diabolical Traps (in plants), The Slave Trade, Pastoral Civilizations (among ani mals), Intoxication, Decline and Suicide, and Insight. The author describes animals that calcu late, animals that paint, animals that speak. "We have long given up refusing to believe in the intuitive knowledge of animals," he says. "Now we face another enigma: the possibility of analogous traits within the vegetable kingdom." An outline of plant psychology is actually included as a chap ter in the book. Armed with more than just a few grains of salt, the reader will find a review of a wide variety of ethological studies illus trated, here and there, with startling photo graphs. He will also find a biographical listing for some eighteen pioneers in the study of animal behavior; also a short glos sary, and a list of some sixty-six references. The layman will enjoy this book; so will the young high school student. The biologist may enjoy it, too, but he is sure to squirm.
