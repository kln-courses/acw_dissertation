ABSTRACT Critical in vehicle crash simulations, human body data sets include mass, moments of inertia (MOIs), and ellipsoid size for each body segment, and location and resistive torque properties for each joint. The Generator of Body Data (GEBOD) program generates these human data sets for use in multibody programs. The objective of this study was to validate GEBOD estimates by directly measuring whole-body inertial properties of 69 volunteers and comparing the results with values calculated by the Articulated Total Body (ATB) model using GEBOD data sets. While the predicted whole-body center of gravity (CG) averaged within 1 cm of the measured values In the horizontal direction, vertically the errors were much larger. The predicted principal MOI were consistently 5%-30% lower than the measured values. INTRODUCTION Multibody dynamics programs for simulating human body response in automobile and aircraft crashes, aircraft ejections, and other dynamic environments require data sets describing the geometry and mass properties of the body. Directly measuring some of these parameters, specifically individual segmental inertial properties, on live humans is inherently very difficult, if not impossible. Many indirect methods have been used to estimate these parameters, including measuring cadaver segments, stereophotogrammetry, and laser scanning. The Generator of Body Data (GEBOD) program [1] was developed to provide these data sets for the ATB model [2], and was later modified to provide data sets for MADYMO (MAthmatical DYnamical MOdel) [3]. A typical GEBOD data set is illustrated in Figure 1 . The data sets include the following for each segment: segment mass segment center of gravity (CG) location segment principal MOIs orientation of principal axes surface ellipsoid geometry joint locations joint ranges of motion joint resistive torque properties While many of the human data sets generated by GEBOD have been validated by comparing results of ATB simulations with controlled impact tests of human volunteers [4][5], there has not been an effort to specifically validate the mass properties predicted by GEBOD. Recently, the U.S. Air Force has been concerned about the whole-body CG location and MOIs of crewmembers in ejection seats. This information is essential in the design of controllable propulsion for ejection seat stability with future aircrew members, including small and large males and females. To determine the range of CG locations and MOIs, a test protocol was set up to measure these data on a set of Individuals representing the potential future pilot population in a generic seat. This provided a unique opportunity to validate some of the data generated by GEBOD. The overall approach for this study was to select subjects representative of the future military pilot population, take their detailed anthropometric measurements, and then measure their whole-body inertial properties in a seated position. Concurrently, ATB models of each subject were generated using the GEBOD program, which were placed in the same seated position, and the ATB calculated the whole-body inertial properties. These calculated properties were then compared to the measured values to determine how well GEBOD and ATB 3755</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1 . Typical human body data set created by GEBOD. predict whole-body inertia! properties, and by extension, how accurate GEBOD is in generating individual segment inertia! properties. GEBOD PROGRAM GEBOD has two options for obtaining data sets for adult humans. The first, called the user-supplied body dimensions option, allows the user to specify a set of thirty-two body dimensions for the subject to be created. The second, called adult human male or female option, allows the user to specify the gender and height and/or weight of the subject to be created. A different method is used for each option to calculate the mass and geometric properties of adult humans. USER-SUPPLIED BODY DIMENSIONS OPTION - The user-supplied body dimensions option computes the segment ellipsoid semiaxes and joint locations using expressions based on the anthropometric body dimensions supplied by the user. It was assumed that, when the body is in a standing position with the arms at the sides, the joints are all in the same coronal plane. The shoulder and hip joints are offset laterally from the midsagitta! plane and the other limb joints are directly below them. The ellipsoid centers are also assumed to be in the same plane. Except for the torso and feet, the mass properties for each segment are based on its ellipsoid volume. Basic geometric volumes derived from the user- supplied dimensions are used to calculate the torso and feet segment mass properties. This technique assumes that the human body is homogeneous and therefore all body segments have the same density. ADULT HUMAN MALE AND FEMALE OPTION - The adult human male and female option bases most of its calculations on McConville's male [6] and Young's female [7] stereophotometric surveys. These surveys provided three-dimensional, whole-body surface data as seen in Figure 2, which was segmented based on anatomical landmarks. The surface data for each subject were used to calculate the segment volumes, for determining the mass properties. GEBOD uses regression Figure 2. Typical stereophotometric data. equations, based on height and weight, from these stereo studies to predict the segment mass properties. Again the body is assumed to be homogeneous with constant density between segments. Similar regression equations were developed for the joint center locations, which were referenced to the measured anatomical landmarks. Regression equations are also used to calculate the same thirty-two body dimensions in the user-supplied option. 3756 SEGMENTS JOINTS 1 Pelvis A Pelvis/Abdomen 2 Abdomen B Abdomen/Thorax 3 Thorax C Neck Pivot 4 Neck D Head Pivot 5 Head E Right Hip 6 Right Thigh F Right Knee 7 Right Leg G Right Ankle 8 Right Foot H Left Hip 9 Left Thigh I Left Knee 10 Left Leg J Left Ankle 1 1 Left Foot K Right Shoulder 12 Right Upper Arm L Right Elbow 1 3 Right Forearm M Right Wrist 14 Right Hand N Left Shoulder 1 5 Left Upper Arm O Left Elbow 16 Left Forearm P Left Wrist 17 Left Hand</page><page sequence="3">These calculated dimensions and the joint locations are used to determine the contact ellipsoid semiaxes and locations. TEST METHOD SUBJECT SELECTION - Subjects were selected based on the Department of Defense databases of samples which are representative of the potential future pilot population. Subjects were solicited from local universities and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base personnel. All subjects participating in the study were volunteers, with no required technical qualifications or special training. As required, the entire procedure was first approved by the Air Force Armstrong Laboratory Human Use Review Committee (HURC). The subjects were first screened for height and weight, and, in order to participate, had to meet the established stature versus weight criteria used for entry Into an aviation program. The subjects were asked to wear shorts, T-shirt, and socks only. A total of seventy subjects was selected for testing; sixty-nine were measured for CG and MOI (one subject dropped out of the study). Table 1 shows the average age, weight, and height of the subjects. Subject weight ranged from 44 kgs to 107 kgs. Table 1 . Average subject age, weight and height.

These detailed measurements included the input data required for the GEBOD model. Table 2 provides a listing of the anthropometric measurements taken on each subject. HUMAN MEASUREMENT SYSTEM - The Automated Mass Properties Measurement System, developed at the Armstrong Laboratory, provides an accurate and time efficient means of measuring mass, CG location, and mass MOI. This procedure has been used to test complete manikins, manikin segments, and various helmet systems. The results of these studies have been compiled into databases which have been used in computer models to assess the effectiveness of vehicle safety designs and to study human responses to various head encumbering equipment. The testing procedures used in these programs are completely described In "The Standard Automated Mass Properties (STAMP) Testing and Calibration Procedure [8]". For the testing of human whole-body properties, these procedures were somewhat modified and implemented [9]. Table 2. Anthropometric measurements.

Figure 3 shows the set-up used for the human mass properties study. Figure 3: Mass properties set-up for human mass properties study. 3757</page><page sequence="4">Fittina of Subject Within the Lightweight Seat and Holding Box - The lightweight seat and three-sided holding box were designed to hold the subject during testing and to provide a Cartesian coordinate system which allows transformation of properties to a predetermined seat coordinate system. The lightweight seat was designed to accommodate the population of interest, with height adjustability and adjustable Velcro and buckle-type straps to secure the subject within the seat. As shown in Figure 4, the subject was placed in the seat such that the subject's thighs were parallel to the X-Y plane (floor), and 90° to the legs. The upper arms were kept alongside the upper torso and held against the seat back. The forearm positions were dependent upon comfort and location of the holding straps. Thigh and forearm angular pitch were recorded, along with forearm yaw. These positions are important for the ATB model. The subject donned an HGU-55/P helmet and visor assembly, which held the subject's head and neck in position and provided protection. Since the helmet was affixed to the seat back, alignment of the subjects was consistent. Once the subject was secured within the seat, the measurement process was initiated. Figure 4: Manikin secured in lightweight chair. Weight and Center of Gravity Determination - The weight and CG location were determined with the use of an electronic balance and moment table assembly. The human subject within the holding fixture (referred to as the composite) was hoisted onto the electronic balance, and the weight was recorded. The moment table assembly was then placed on the electronic balance and adjustable stand. The composite's CG location in the box X (composite facing forward, in an upright position), Y (composite rotated 90-degrees, in an upright position), and Z (composite set on its back) axes was then recorded by hoisting and rotating the composite about the respective axis. Figure 5 shows the electronic balance and moment table assembly loaded with the composite in the CGX measurement configuration. To determine the center of gravity of the human subject alone, the entire procedure was repeated for the empty seat. The empty seat CG was then analytically subtracted from the composite data, resulting in the CG of the human subject in a seated position. The CG measurements are based on a coordinate system originating at the Seat Reference Point (SRP), which is located at the intersection of the seat back and the seat pan, at the midline of the seat. With the origin at the SRP, the Z-axis extends in the positive direction upward along the seat-back, the X-axis extends in the positive direction forward along the seat pan, and the Y-axis extends in the positive direction to the left. Figure 5: Measurement of the CG about the x-axis. Moments of Inertia Determination - Measurement of the MOIs of the composite was accomplished using the Space Electronics Mass Properties Instrument (MPI), Model KGR 8945. This instrument is based on a torsional pendulum technique. The center of mass measured on the moment table was used to align the composite's CG with the torsion axis of the MPI. Center of gravity was measured using the MPI to confirm subject placement before measuring the moment of inertia. Moments of inertia were measured along six different axes with the composite, and again with the empty seat. Figure 6 shows the measurement of the moment about the SRP Y- axis. The empty seat moments were then analytically subtracted from the composite to obtain six moments of inertia for the subject alone, in a seated position. These moments were used to form an inertia tensor from which the orientation and magnitudes of the principal MOIs were determined. 3758</page><page sequence="5">Figure 6: Moment of inertia about the y-axis. ACCURACY AND REPEATABILITY TESTS - Before testing human subjects, accuracy and repeatability testing of the mass properties measurement system was performed [10]. A 68.0 kg homogeneous, rectilinear calibration steel slug was used as the first test object. The slug was strapped into the lightweight chair, and CG and MOI measurements were taken along the six different axes using the mass properties instrument. These six moments were used to calculate an inertia tensor from which the principal moments were computed. This process was performed three times. Since this was a homogenous, symmetric object, its principal moments of inertia could be easily calculated for comparison to the measured values (Table 3). The X principal moment had less than 0.5% error, and the Y principal moment had an error of about 4%. Since the calibration slug was tall and thin and the chair was designed to support a human, the slug slipped slightly when turned on its side, possibly explaining this larger error. The Z principal MOI had approximately a 5% error. This Z moment was much smaller than the other two moments, therefore the differences in these values result in larger percentage differences than for the larger moments. Table 3.

The wood and concrete slug was strapped into the chair and CG and MOI measurements were taken using the mass properties instrument. This was performed three times. Calculations were done by adding the CG and MOI from a solid concrete block to those of a hollow wooden shell [11]. The X and Y principal moments had less than 2% error, while the Z moment (still the smallest) had an error of approximately 4% (Table 4). Table 4. Accuracy test: Concrete and wood block.

Three complete sets of measurements were performed over two consecutive days. The subject was secured in the chair and CG and MOI measurements were taken using the mass properties instrument. The mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variance were computed for the CG and principal MOI and are shown in Table 5. The X, Y, and Z CGs had a coefficient of variance of less than l%. The X, Y, and Z MOIs had a coefficient of variance of less than 2%. VALIDATION WITH A MANIKIN - In order to validate both the testing procedure and the ATB's calculation of the whole-body center of gravity and principal moments of inertia, a large ADAM (Advanced Dynamic Anthropomorphic Manikin) was disassembled at its articulations into its component segments. Each segment was measured to obtain its mass, principal moments of inertia, center of gravity location, joint locations, and surface dimensions, as well as the joint torque properties. These measurements were used to assemble an ATB model of the large ADAM [12]. The model has eighteen segments and seventeen joints. The whole-body CG and principal MOI of a large ADAM were measured using the same procedure used for the human subjects. The positions of several points on the dummy were measured in the seat coordinate system with the electronic position coordinate digitizer. The ATB model of the large ADAM was precisely positioned using the measured ADAM points. The ATB program then calculated the whole-body CG and MOI. The ATB-predicted results compared very well with the measured values, as shown in Table 6. 3759</page><page sequence="6">Table 5. Repeatability test: Human subject.

In the first case, the measured height and weight of the subject was the input to GEBOD; in the other case, thirty-two anthropometric measurements were input. In all cases, a fifteen-segment model was created. Initially, the linear and angular positions of the segments were determined using measurements taken during the testing process, similar to the method used with 3760 the ADAM. However, since it was desired to check the results of the entire, normal ATB modeling process, a different method of positioning the subject models was ultimately used. Three planar surfaces (planes) were defined to model the seat pan, seat back, and floor (Figure 7). Contacts between these planes and the body segments and between the segments were defined. The body models were positioned within the seat to closely approximate the position of the subject within the actual seat, and such that the segments were in static equilibrium. Equilibrium was achieved by positioning the model, running the ATB for time zero, and checking the initial linear and angular accelerations of each segment. Adjustments to the segment positions were made until the accelerations were acceptably low. The ATB program was then run to calculate the whole-body inertial properties. Figure 7. GEBOD data set positioned by ATB model in seat. RESULTS CENTER OF GRAVITY - The CG was found for each subject based on a coordinate system with the origin at the SRP. The measured data showed female subjects' CGs tend to be lower and further back as compared to the male subjects' CGs. For this reason female and male data have been separated when comparing measured and predicted CGs. Table 7 shows the averages of the differences in CGX and CGZ between the measured data and those predicted using the two GEBOD options. On average, the adult human option had an error of about 1 cm for CGX, while the user-supplied option had an average Table 7. Summary CG data.

For CGZ the adult option had an average error of 1.9 cm, while the user-supplied option had an average error of 5.0 cm. Figure 8 shows that both options over and under predict CGX. CGZ is mainly under predicted, especially by the user-supplied option, as seen in Figure 9. Figure 8. Measured and predicted CGX locations. Figure 9. Measured and predicted CGZ locations. Figure 10 and Figure 1 1 show plots of all the CGs, both females and males. On each plot, ellipses have been added around measured, adult option, and user- supplied option points to illustrate the overall difference between the cases. This again indicates that the adult option does a better job of predicting CGZ than does the user-supplied option, but the user-supplied option better demonstrates the variability between subjects. The adult option has very little variability in predicting CGZ since it does not account for the differences in body proportions. Figure 10. Female center of gravity locations. Figure 1 1 . Male center of gravity locations. MOMENTS OF INERTIA - The test results showed that the measured MOI data (X, Y, and Z principal moments through the center of gravity) are primarily dependent on the subject's mass and stature. There is no difference in MOI between males and females except that the females were usually smaller and therefore had smaller moments. Table 8 shows the average percent error in the X, Y, and Z moments between the measured data and the predicted using the two GEBOD options. On average the adult option had an error of about 15%, 16% 3761</page><page sequence="8">Table 8. Summary MOI data.

Measured and predicted principal MOIY. DISCUSSION The whole-body mass properties testing methodology proved to be accurate and reliable in the test block, manikin, and human subject measurements. For the test block, the system accuracy was within 4%. Also 3762 Figure 14. Measured and predicted principal MOIz. the coefficient of variance with human subjects was less than 2%. The manikin results verified the analytic procedure used in the ATB to obtain whole-body mass properties from the segmented body data set. The difference between measured and predicted center of gravity was less than 3 mm, and the moments of inertia varied by less than 3%. While the predicted GEBOD mass properties are representative of the population trends seen in the human test data, there are significant differences in CG locations and MOI magnitudes. Both GEBOD options predicted the CGX location within 1 .5 cm, on average, and reflected the subject body size variability. The CGZ differences were much more significant, especially for the user-supplied option. However, because the user-supplied option takes into account specific body part dimensions, it resulted in CGZ scatter similar to that seen in the test data. Meanwhile, the adult human option, which only uses subject height and weight, predicts little variation in CGZ. The MOI are consistently under predicted using both GEBOD options. The two larger moments, lx and ly, averaged 16% error, while lz averaged 20% error. Iz is typically one-fourth the magnitude of lx or Ļ. In this case, both options demonstrated the population variability seen in the test data. There are a number of possible sources for the differences seen between the predicted and measured data. While the subjects were constrained as much as safely possible, some subject movement was evident, especially when they were moved between upright, reclined, and angled orientations. This primarily affected CGZ location, measured with the subjects in the reclined position. In this position, subjects frequently reported torso extension. Some minor errors may have resulted from variations between test and modeled individual body segment orientations. Positioning the body in the ATB program involved balancing the body weight against the seat pan. Therefore, the predicted CGZ locations are highly dependent upon the force-deflection properties defined for the contacts, and the lower torso and thigh</page><page sequence="9">ellipsoid dimensions. The ellipsoid geometry is approximated by GEBOD based on limited body dimensions. These ellipsoids, particularly the center offset with respect to the segment CG, are likely to be inaccurate, causing poor positioning of the individual segment CGs within the seat. This positioning would have little effect on MOI predictions. In the user-supplied option, the simplified geometric shapes used to calculate segment volumes could cause error in the calculated mass properties. Finally, in both options, the constant density assumption does not account for mass distribution variability within and between segments. Based on this study, several directions are being considered for improving GEBOD mass property predictions. The ellipsoid geometries will be reviewed and adjusted based on this study's findings and other available data. The adult human option, which uses more detailed body surface data to calculate the segment mass properties, provides better overall predictions than does the user-supplied option. Therefore, the use of whole- body 3-D laser scanning, providing more accurate surface data, may further improve volume prediction. Also allowing the adult human option to use additional subject body dimensions would increase its ability to account for body proportion variability. Testing of subjects in different body segment orientations (i.e., seated with legs straight forward, prone, etc.) would allow individual segment properties to be derived from the differences in the whole- body measurements and would provide insight into the density variation between segments. For example, increasing the head and foot density and reducing the torso density would increase the whole-body MOI. The homogeneous density assumption can also be investigated using modern imaging techniques, providing insight on mass distribution throughout the body. The possible benefits of several of these approaches will be explored analytically using the ATB model. It Is important to recognize that the validity of the GEBOD generated human body data sets is dependent upon the user's application. This study's results show errors in whole-body mass properties that may have significant effects on controlled-propulsion ejection seat design. However, the CG and MOI errors are small compared to the range seen within the population and are less than variations seen due to positioning or body motion within an ejection seat [13]. For other applications in which whole-body inertlal properties are not of interest, such as predictions of body dynamics in impact events, earlier validation studies have demonstrated that the errors in mass distribution may not have significant effect on simulation results.
