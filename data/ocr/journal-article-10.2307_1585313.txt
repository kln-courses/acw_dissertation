Among other interesting contributions which touch on the subject of Torah reading and study, Reinhard Pummer considers the position in early Samaritan synagogues, our knowledge of which has been greatly extended by recent archaeological work. [N.R.M DE LANGE] PJ. GENTRY, The Asterisked Materials in the Greek Job. Septuagint and Cognate Studies Series 38. xxxvii + 559 pp. Scholars Press, Atlanta, GA, 1995. This is a slightly revised version of the author's PhD thesis presented to the University of Toronto in 1994 (supervisorJ.W. Wevers). Gentry provides an exhaustive analysis of the asterisked material in the Greek text of Job. The study was aided by the publication in 1982 of the Gottingen volume by J. Ziegler, which provided a reliable platform for examining the reviser's text. The work falls naturally into three sections, in addition to the con- clusion. First, Gentry ascertains exactly what material can be attributed to Theodotion. A brief historical survey of the textual tradition and an introductory methodology pre- cede a detailed examination and analysis of Ziegler's edition. Once the scope of the project has been established, the second chapter attempts a characterisation of the material. Nouns, pronouns, verbs, transliterations and particles are considered, in addi- tion to verbless clauses and word-order. This type of method is employed "since even a cursory examination of the asterisked materials reveals that the approach of R in rendering the Hebrew is literalistic and quantitative" (p. 85). Naturally this assessment of translation technique is rather lengthy-just under three hundred pages-but it pro- vides a firm basis for the section that follows. Ch. three attempts to place the aster- isked material in the larger textual history ofJob, by contrasting R with the Old Greek of Job, the "So-Called Kaige Group" (Minor Prophets Scroll from Nahal Hever), the Greek Psalter and Aquila. A very brief final chapter summarises Gentry's conclusions. The volume concludes with four appendices, proposed corrections to the lemma of Ziegler's edition, and a bibliography. [J.M. SQUIRRELL] J.C.L. GIBSON, Language and Imagery in the Old Testament. ix + 166 pp. SPCK, London, 1998. Even if Gibson admits that the OT is "capable of causing not a little embarrassment to the two religions which have adopted it as their Scriptures", he finds it also "seductive", "moving" and "illuminating". His little book is meant to guide the reader to fuller appreciation of these latter qualities and in this he must be judged to have succeeded. His first of seven well-written chapters, entitled "The Energies of the Hebrew Language", suggests the lack of abstract terms and the linking together of clauses by "and" as the "two basic characteristics of biblical Hebrew". The picture is filled out by several not unimportant features: prominence of direct speech, cosmo- logical descriptions of heaven and Sheol, the extravagance of Semitic address, folk ety- mologies, figurative language, hyperbole, personalisation, irony, etc. Throughout this chapter Gibson indicates the considerable distance which separates theological lan- guage from that of the OT. In ch. two ("Language about God in the Old Testament"), Gibson approaches the (non-)problem of anthropomorphism by way of the recognition that all theology is metaphorical. Faced with such incautious expression, the point is to understand rather than to approve. A discussion of the incomparability of Yahweh (closer to henotheism than to monotheism) rounds off the chapter. Full-blown monothe- istic statements such as Isa. xliii 10 represent "the exaggeration of faith" rather than systematic theology, since so much of the OT refuses to evacuate creation of other "theologically real" gods. Ch. three ("The Rhetoric of Hebrew Prose Writing") asks us "Why Prose?", a question occasioned by the paucity of ancient near eastern precedent. En route to a tentative answer in terms of narrative theology, Gibson guides us through such features as composite authorship, reticence, the resonance of key words, and char- acterisation by what the protagonists say, here and there pausing to criticise the "fissiparous tendencies" of "excavatory scholarship", too full of sources and too deaf to accomplished story-telling. After sketching out the basics of metre and parallelism,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK LIST 415 ch. four ("The Rhetoric and Melodies of Hebrew Poetry") explains and illustrates the rhetoric of judgement, comfort, praise, lament, confident wisdom, and questioning wis- dom. Gibson allows us his own evaluation of aspects of biblical poetry, whether this be his appraisal of Proverbs ("too smug by half"), his suggestion that Christian poetry is more preoccupied with sin and confession than that of the Psalms, or his traditional conclusion that Job's "redeemer" (xix 23 ff.) must be God himself. Gibson's ch. five ("The Rhetoric of Hebrew Myth") mounts an apology for myth, whether its toned- down priestly variety in Genesis ii or the less restrained mythic voice of the psalms and prophets. Israel's mythology has points of contact with that of her neighbours, but Israel's experience of God in her own history produced a unique "standard of judge- ment". Gibson's reading of the second Yahweh speech in Job is an illuminating attempt to beat back the modemisers and rescue this divine soliloquy for the genre. The sec- ond element in the book's title becomes the focus of its last two chapters (six, "Images of God"; seven, "Image of Humanity"). Sustaining the point that images-like all God- talk-are metaphorical and suggestive, Gibson cites texts which feature the principal ones (king, judge, father [and mother], redeemer, etc.). Refusing to be drawn in the- ological directions-though perhaps not entirely-Gibson concludes that such images tell us how Israel conceived of God, not how he is in himself: "The time for know- ing him is not yet, but in another life." Similarly in his discussion of human imagery (e.g. "knowledge of good and evil", "human creatureliness"), Gibson's avowedly empir- ical survey of OT language and imagery ends with an expression of the chastened faith which this literature so often evokes (p. 154.) [D.A. BAER] Cyrus H. GORDON and Gary A. RENDSBURG, The Bible and the Ancient Near East. 345 pp. W.W. Norton, New York, 1997. With Rendsburg's collaboration this is a thor- oughly revised version of Gordon's previous three editions, Introduction to Old Testament Times (1953), The World of the Old Testament (1958) and The Ancient Near East (1965), now updated to include discussions on such topics as Ebla and the "House of David" inscrip- tion from Tell Dan. It is a panoramic survey of the literature and history of the ancient Near East, finding extensive parallels to the Bible in sources ranging from Homer to the Nuzi texts. The book is aimed at a popular audience, retelling well-known bibli- cal and extrabiblical narratives with copious explanatory asides. Since the territory is so familiar the book may prove less attractive to scholars, but because of its range it throws up possible parallels and causal connections that should be of great interest even to specialists. Among the many unusual suggestions made is that Elisha asked not for a double portion of Elijah's spirit, but for two-thirds of it (p. 228). At the level of framework the authors argue for a twelfth-century exodus, a Pentateuch basically from the time of David and Solomon and pure monotheism developing in the sixth century B.C. The authors state their views unguardedly at times: "It cannot be overempha- sized that the discoveries of archeology tend to justify the literal meaning of the text as against scholarly and traditional interpretation. This holds not only for the Bible but for ancient texts in general" (p. 117, n. 17). The authors' desire to read the text literally and yet rationalistically produces the following analysis of Joshua's activities at Jericho: "When the Israelites finally attacked, they shouted and blasted their horns, and it is quite possible that the sound waves created by these actions would have weak- ened the walls to force them to collapse" (p. 170). If it were as simple as that it is surprising that the Big Bad Wolf approach to house demolition was not adopted in subsequent military history. A couple of dittographies of about a line each occur on pp. 230 and 233, but in general the book is well produced and is one that should be read widely. [PJ. WILLIAMS] F.H.
