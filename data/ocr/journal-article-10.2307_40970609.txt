We live in an era when most orthodox economists make a mockery of most of what is signified by that protean term "value" in our culture, and paradoxically are rewarded handsomely for it. Let me give a trivial but telling example. On the front page of the New York Times of Sunday, March 4, 1990, there was an article describing how a professor of economics of impeccable credentials and lofty station had "put some noses out of joint" by claiming to have developed a mathematical equation which would predict the quality of French red-wine vintages before they could be tasted and classified by the glitterati of the degustateurs. The professor, who published his own wine newsletter, claimed to have reduced the quality of red Bordeaux to a single-valued index number, and then to have fit an ordinary least-squares equation to its putative primary determinants, which consist of winter rain, harvest rain, and average temperature during SOCIAL RESEARCH, Vol. 57, No. 3 (Fall 1990)</page><page sequence="2">690 SOCIAL RESEARCH growing season.1 As one would expect, the enologists were offended by the upstart and his equation, insisting that he ignored important differences in estates, grapes, the skill of the vintners, the provenance of the casks, and so on. But those who are familiar with these sorts of practices in the orthodox economics literature will detect a more deep-rooted contempt for those who claim to be arbiters of any species of evaluation. This orthodoxy, to which I will refer as "neoclassical" theory, delights in debunking analytical statements about value. It instinctively disbelieves any expertise other than that embodied in the "market." The height of self-congratulation for such an orthodox economist is to deploy science (which is automatically equated with a simple deterministic mathematical model) to contradict what common sense, canons of morality, or the wisdom of some elect might dictate. In our specific example, the newspaper article compared the economist's wine ratings with those of two wine-buyer's guides; that they diverged widely was not taken as adverse evidence but, quite the contrary, as yet another aspect of Vipatement des bourgeois. It would seem the orthodox economist is that most celebrated of adolescent culture heroes, the rebel without a cause. But no: here the orthodox economist must halt and venture no further, because to question what species of value the market ratifies is to unravel the entire exercise. Take again our upstart economist wine adviser. His theory tells him that all prices should be traced back to individual preference orderings, which, alas, exhibit no regular prior determinants and are inaccessible to the social researcher. Further, he just can't ask people what they think they like, since they tend to 1 The equation, for the curious, is wineindex = - 12.145 + 0.001 17wintrain + 0.6164temp - 0.00386harvrain. The quality and plausibility of the statistics involved is treated in the usual cavalier manner, described in Steven Sklivas and Philip Mirowski, "Why Econometricians Don't Replicate (Although They Do Reproduce)," Review of Political Economy, forthcoming. That a busy professor who is also managing editor of one of the most important orthodox economics journals of the profession can find time to research and run a wine newsletter on the side is perhaps a testimonial to the entrepreneurial skills of the discipline.</page><page sequence="3">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 691 give wrong answers: that is, what they say would contradict the mathematical structures that undergird neoclassical theory.2 To preserve his scientific demeanor, our economist says good-bye to all that and creates an "index" of "wine quality," which of course serves as an ersatz surrogate for the entire value question. Then he proceeds to posit some linear equation which "explains" the index by means of some mildly dubious but widely practiced statistical procedures. (Anyone spotting both the rabbit and the hat wins one free subscription to the wine newsletter.) Hence, he can claim that value is idiosyncratic and unfettered; and simultaneously that value is determinate and scientific and tough-minded and irrefutable. The pinnacle of this contradiction is reached when our economist accuses the wine experts of misjudging tastings, thus driving a wedge between existing prices of new vintages and their "true" values. Where did the normal connotations of "value" go in all this? One man's Merlot may be another man's poison; but presumably we do feel confident in discriminating between an emetic and an alexipharmic. The problem with modern economic discourse is that it doesn't take value seriously; it veers increasingly between denying its importance altogether and asserting a complete comprehension of its contours. A few voices have bucked the trend, reminding us that "theories of value, far from being pedagogical devices for periodizing the history of economic thought . . . powerfully influence the constitution of economic thought itself by identifying different elements within the social process as strategic in our understanding of it."3 But these voices have been drowned out The literature which demonstrates empirical disconfirmations of various aspects of neoclassical preference theory is prodigious; and most of it is ignored by economists. See, for instance, Richard Thaler, "The Psychology of Choice," in Alvin Roth, ed., Laboratory Experimentation in Economics (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987); Daniel Kahneman, Paul Slovic, and Amos Tversky, eds., Judgment Under Uncertainty (New York: Cambridge University Press 1982); and Robin Hogarth and Melvin Reder, eds., Rational Choice (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987). 3 Robert Heilbroner, "The Problem of Value in the Constitution of Economic Thought," Social Research 50 (Summer 1983): 253.

The question is an unvarnished philosophical one, something that causes the average economist's eyes to glaze over. And yet it is the very neglect of historical and philosophical considerations which has stymied sensible discus- sion of the theory of value. Two Categories of Value Theory At the inception of neoclassical economics, in the decade of the 1870s, it became commonplace for the partisans of the marginalist revolution to assert that mathematics had delivered them from the curse of value altogether. Take, for instance, William Stanley Jevons: "the word value . . . merely expresses the circumstance of [a commodity] exchanging in a certain ratio for some other substance. . . . Value will be expressed, like angular magnitude and other ratios in general, by abstract number. ... I shall discontinue the use of the word altogether." The attitude that "Value is bunk" persists down to present-day neoclassical texts such as Gerard Debreu's Theory of Value, which despite its title refuses to discuss the meaning of the term "value" beyond defining it in passing as price times quantity.4 But the assertion that value is expressed in the format of ratios is not much better than an assertion that value and price are sometimes used as synonyms. This rhetorical ploy of banishing a troublesome word to the ethereal realms of whom I have found helpful are: Gunnar Myrdal, The Political Element in the Development of Economic Theory (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1969); Alfred Sohn-Rethel, Intellectual and Manual Labour (London: Macmillan, 1978); Michael Thompson, Rubbish Theory (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979); Alvin Gouldner, For Sociology (New York: Basic, 1973); and Marshall Sahlins, Culture and Practical Reason (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1976). 4W.

Nevertheless a theory of value could not be conjured away so easily, for the neoclassicals possessed one as well, however they might sneer at their despised metaphysical cousins. Value theory, far from being an amorphous grab bag of moral considerations or a labyrinth of confused metaphysical speculation, has historically conformed to a very few impera- tives in economics.5 Throughout its various incarnations, it has persistently been an attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What is it about a market system that renders commodities commensurate, and hence susceptible to valua- tion? (2) What conservation principles embody the tenets posited in the answer to (1), thus permitting quantitative causal analysis? (3) How are the conservation principles identified in (2) linked to the larger metaphorical structures in the culture for purposes of justification and legitimation, given that all conservation principles are ultimately unjustifiable? We here use the terminology of "conservation principles" in much the same way that it is used in physics: namely, as invariants or symmetries imposed upon a problem in order to simplify its solution. For instance, the "conservation of energy" is a condition imposed upon many physical problems, positing that the amount of energy in a closed system is a constant under a class of transformations. In Piaget's famous experi- ments with children, the "conservation of volume" referred to whether the water poured from a tall pitcher into a number of squat tumblers was the "same amount" of water in a child's eyes. Notions of conservation are also central to the mathemat- ical definition of a "group." The key to understanding 5 The following discussion is a telegraphed version of my More Heat Than Light- Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989).</page><page sequence="6">694 SOCIAL RESEARCH conservation principles in any area of human discourse is that they express the conviction of identity and reversibility of a specified action or process in the presence of specified changes of state or disposition.6 One curious fact about conservation principles, noted by historians and philosophers alike, is that although they are often cited as "laws" or "theories" in epochs of greatest enthusiasm for them, they do not seem to enjoy the same epistemological status as correlative theories. In practice, they are nearly immune to empirical falsification, at least in part because they are treated as conditions that all constituent theories must obey in order to assume a role in a given research program. Their status is further called into question by the realization that they are all false to a greater or lesser degree: nothing in human experience is perfectly invariant, perfectly identical, or perfectly reversible. Take, for instance, the law of the conservation of energy. No terrestrial phenomenon is perfectly reversible due to friction, heat dissipation, and so forth; thus the law of conservation of energy had to be augmented by the second law of thermody- namics to "explain" the absence of invariance posited by the first law. The conservation of energy is also impugned by the theory of general relativity, in certain modern cosmological theories, and elsewhere; but energy conservation is not "disproved" as a consequence. If this sounds like a rehearsal of the ancient dispute between the changelessness of the circle of Parmenides and the ceaseless flux of Heraclitus, then the reader is not far off the mark. The structure of conservation principles is the provi- sional solution of the modern West to the deep problem of reconciling constancy to change. Any time there is a demand for a formal definition of equivalence, a quantitative specifica- 6 The philosophical significance of conservation principles was brought to light by Emile Meyerson in his Identity and Reality (New York: Dover, 1962 [1903]) and was used with great ingenuity by Jean Piaget.

While this is clear enough in the history of the physical sciences, not much attention has been paid to the parallel situation in economics, which has mostly appeared under the rubric of value theory. Value, as everyone knows, is about prices; but it is also about much more than prices. It analyzes fundamental beliefs concerning why seemingly diverse objects and human endeav- ors are comparable; and even more outlandishly, how such comparisons can be reduced to a single common denominator of number. Irreducible differences are dissolved in the acid bath of market exchange: divergent personal consciousnesses, diversities in phenomenal objects bearing similar designations, differences in temporal location and geographic and cultural situation, and even distinctions of apparent principle such as that between the artist and the panderer: "Every man has his price," says the wicked cynic. All are juxtaposed and subsumed as expressions of value.7 While this search for the lowest common denominator might be written off as mere rhapsodizing over an essence that just isn't there, a rhapsody so drearily characteristic of nineteenth- century thought, it would be a mistake to conclude that prices are transparently the ratio of physical units and nothing more. Value in the economic sphere may be regarded as the imposition of a set of invariance principles which are factually false but are eminently useful on both a pragmatic and a deeper conceptual level. Alfred Sohn-Rethel has stated it most succinctly: The entire exchange abstraction is founded upon social postulate and not upon fact. It is a postulate that the use of commodities must remain suspended until the exchange takes place; it is a postulate that no physical change should occur in 7 Sohn-Rethel, Intellectual, pp. 46 et seq.; Karl Marx, Capital, vol. 1 (New York: Vintage, 1977), chs. 1-6.</page><page sequence="8">696 SOCIAL RESEARCH the commodities and this applies even if the facts belie it; it is a postulate that the commodities in the exchange relationship should count as equal despite their factual difference; it is a postulate that the alienation and acquisition of things between commodity holders is tied to the condition of exchangeability; it is a postulate that commodities change owners by a translation from one locality to another without being materially affected. None of these form-concepts imply statements of fact. They are all norms which commodity exchange has to obey to be possible.8 What has been missing in so many discussions of value, mired as they so often are either in Marxian notions of fetishism and reification or neoclassical mystifications of "social welfare," is to trace precisely how these curious conventions come about, and how they are enforced. The germ of this reorientation can be found in the quote in the suggestion that commodity exchange has been conceptualized as "translation," that is, as motion. Here the histories of physics and economics converge. In both fields of endeavor, what had seemed incomprehensible transmogrification was tamed by being redescribed as motion: that is, as a projection of our own bodily activity. The famous Greek paradoxes of an object simultaneously present and absent were the paradigm of the unity of being and not-being. The metaphor of motion is not just one rhetorical figure among many, pounced upon by the trendy avatar of deconstruction and hounded to the very margins of the text. The metaphor of motion, in conjunction with the anthropomorphic habit of projecting our bodies out into the world, have been the primal building blocks of the Western value concept over the last three centuries. During the period of the rise to predominance of market structures, Western European cultures have regarded eco- nomic value in much the same manner that they have regarded motion. The structure of invariants that the West has used to formalize and quantify motion has been projected onto 8 Sohn-Rethel, Intellectual, p. 68.</page><page sequence="9">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 697 exchange relations in order likewise to formalize and quantify value. The two primary examples of this procedure are encapsulated in the traditions of classical political economy and neoclassical economics. The former, predicated upon a Cartesian treatment of motion as an embodied substance that is passed about from body to body by means of collision, but conserved as a whole in the world, was reincarnated in the image of value as a substance embodied in the commodity and passed about intact through the action of exchange of equivalents. The latter, predicated upon the mid-nineteenth- century treatment of motion within the ontology of a field of force, displaced value from the commodity itself and located it within the mind as a field of preferences. Beyond merely noting these broad resemblances, I here intend to convey that value and motion were literal transcrip- tions of one another, more literal in the later than in the earlier theories of value. While classical political economy was fairly prosaic in its conceptualization of value as a substance- corn for the Physiocrats, "stock" for Adam Smith, "labour" for David Ricardo- neoclassical economics transcended those attempts by directly copying the equations of motion in a physical field from energy physics, renaming the variables potential energy, force, and space as "utility," "prices," "commodity space," and so on.9 The idea that value theory is a magic-lantern projection of our most cherished physical concepts should not be as disconcerting as it might first seem. It goes a long way toward answering our third value question, to wit, what justifies the relevant conservation principles, given that they cannot be literal truth? The answer is that our understanding of our social relations is bound up with our understanding of the physical world, an insight dating back to Durkheim and 9 The specifics of the classical position on the substance theory of value can be found in Mirowski, More Heat, ch. 4; while the narrative of the daring daylight robbery of physics which happened during the "marginalist revolution" is developed in detail in ch. 5.</page><page sequence="10">698 SOCIAL RESEARCH Evans-Pritchard, but given added clarity in the recent works of Mary Douglas.10 Douglas has argued that categorizations of the natural world (which themselves originated as projections of social relations) provide the template for categorizations of social experience; and that these analogies and in variances insinuate a moral and political content into what would otherwise appear to be neutral principles of organization. The weakness in Durkheim's interpretation of this thesis was that he thought of this social order as being instilled in each and every participant, but coming into conflict with spread of the market. Turning the tables, we instead suggest that the operation of the market is the prime instance of this conflation of the social and the natural. Thus the success of classical political economy was bound up with its image of value as an embodied substance, shuttled hither and yon by the market. This substance was conserved in exchange, allowing the increase of value to be quantified in production and its decrease to be likewise quantified in consumption. The "conservation of value" in trade could not be demonstrated in any way, but was plausible as long as cultural images of motion reinforced the metaphor. When the very idea of motion underwent profound transformation in the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the notion of value was transformed in the 1870s. With the rise of neoclassical theory, value was reconceptualized as a virtual field in commodity space, and trade became motion in that field. Value was no longer conserved in exchange in the older classical sense, particularly because the neoclassicals wished to argue that trade increased people's utility and thus their realized value; but that did not mean conservation principles had been relinquished altogether. While many of the early partisans of the marginalist revolution did not completely 10 Mary Douglas, How Institutions Think (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1986); idem, Implicit Meanings (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1975); idem, Natural Symbols (London: Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1970).</page><page sequence="11">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 699 copiprehend the physics and its structure, the requirements of the newly appropriated mathematical model did include the prerequisite of a conservative vector field; the way this showed up in the economic models were some subset of an array of postulates which included stipulations that income/endow- ments be given and invariant, that "tastes" could not be altered by the process of exchange, that the marginal utility of money be constant, or any number of other isomorphic assumptions. It is not our present intention to describe the full-blown structure of either classical or neoclassical value theory here.11 Instead, there remains the question of the existence of other options for value theory in Western culture: can one venture beyond the substance metaphor of the classical political economist or the field metaphor of the contemporary neoclassical school? Here is where the Durkheim/Douglas thesis begins to bite. If value is generally grounded in images of the natural world, there are not so very many options to choose from; indeed, the dominance of the classical and neoclassical schools in their respective epochs can be explained by the fact that they succeeded in appropriating the dominant physical metaphors of those epochs. Perhaps other metaphors of motion in the natural world will provide an occasion for a sweeping reconceptualization of value theory in the near future. One suspects that the contemporary cultural fascina- tion with "chaos theory" is a symptom of a search for just such a novel metaphor.12 But again, our present object is not to evaluate the quality of future metaphorical appropriations 1 ! Mirowski, More Heat. 12 While there has been some interest in chaos theory on the part of economists, it has been mostly in attempts to "save" neoclassical value theory.

What would it be like for a "new economics" to deny the "natural" character of value by eschewing physical metaphor? Value Denied Distinguished From Value Constructed Let us return briefly to our three questions of value theory in economics. Two further options which must be differenti- ated seem to be represented in the backwaters and byways of the history of economic thought: one might claim that value does not exist and therefore the three questions have no legitimate answer; or conversely, one could claim that value is a social phenomenon "all the way down," in the sense that the relevant conservation principles are not natural but socially constructed and socially contingent. Some paradigmatic repre- sentatives of the value-denial school are the nineteenth-century theorists Samuel Bailey and William Thornton;13 while I shall argue that the quest for a social theory of value was a hallmark of the early school of American institutionalists such as Thorstein Veblen, John R. Commons, and Benjamin Ander- son.14 The denial of value is a much more weighty proposition than the practices of modern neoclassicals cited in the first section of this paper. It asserts, in response to our three value questions, that there is nothing that renders commodities commensurate from one moment to the next; that nothing is conserved in the economy; and that all physical metaphors 13 Samuel Bailey, A Critical Dissertation on the Nature, Measure and Causes of Value (London: Frank Cass, 1967 [1825]); William Thornton, On Labour, 2nd ed.

Take, for instance, Thornton. He baldly dismissed the embodied-substance theories of value (such as the labor theory of value) prevalent in his era as "that pure abstraction of the mind." He savaged the tendency to ground value in nature: Price is scarcely ever mentioned without provoking a reference to the "inexorable," the "immutable," the eternal laws by which it is governed; to laws which, according to my friend Professor Fawcett, are "as certain in their operation as those which control physical nature." It is no small gain to have discovered that no such despotic laws do or can exist; that, in as much as the sole function of scientific law is to predict the invariable recurrence of the same effects from the same causes, and as there can be no invariability where- as in the case of price- one of the most efficient causes is that ever-changing chameleon, human character or disposition, price cannot possibly be subject to law.15 Bailey likewise ridiculed the idea that there was a natural yardstick of value, asserting that "all we can understand by a measure of value is some commodity which would serve as a medium to ascertain the relation subsisting between two other commodities, that we had no means of bringing into direct comparison."16 It would be a mistake to interpret Bailey as simply advocating a neoclassical numeraire form of measure- ment, because while he acknowledged that prices at a point in time might be expressed by any arbitrary commodity, he also claimed that nothing could serve as a unit of value through time: It is impossible for a direct relation of value to exist between A in 100 [A.D.] and A in 1800 [A.D.], just as it is impossible for the relation of distance to exist between the sun in the former period and the sun at the latter. . . . When we accumulate, we add one thing to another, but it is essential to the process, that 15 Thornton, On Labour, pp. 45, 82. 16 Bailey, Critical Dissertation, p. 98.</page><page sequence="14">702 SOCIAL RESEARCH both should remain in existence. But labour, consisting in mere exertion of muscle power, or the equally evanescent notions of the brain, continually perish in detail, and therefore admit no accumulation.17 It is hard to tell just how seriously Bailey intended this nihilism to be taken; there are times when his other, more recondite philosophical writings seem to suggest that he courted controversy simply to provoke the staid academy out of its complacency.18 Nevertheless, were there to be no intertemporal phenomenon of value, and nothing conserved through time, then, as Marx insisted, investment and capitalism itself would be irrational at base.19 This eventuality does not strictly rule out the possibility of its truth; but it does rule out the existence of an intellectual discipline devoted to the explanation of the "rationality" of exchange value. This is the sense in which a theory of value is the heart and soul of economics, for without it, there is no justification for a separate inquiry into the nature and causes of pecuniary wealth. In this respect, both Bailey and Thornton were true to their principles: neither regarded themselves as "political econo- mists" or academic economists, but made their living in business and the civil service respectively, and thought of themselves as philosophers or generalists. Thus the substance and field theories of value are direct projections of specific physical metaphors of conservation principles, whereas the denial of value closes off the option of any specific economic theory. Is there some fourth way, some 17 Ibid., pp. 73, 220. 18 "The world is full of ignorance and error, and I am glad to see a zealous pursuit of even singular and eccentric views, as the means of ultimately lessening the evil.

It's Only Unnatural Any number of social theorists have complained that a truly synoptic approach to the economy should recognize that evaluation is intrinsically social as opposed to individual, in contrast to the neoclassical penchant for finding all powers and capacities for valuation as inherent in the individual. The problem has been to carry this insight beyond ineffectual criticism, by formulating a socially grounded theory that could subsequently be instrumental in the construction of a theory of price, market coordination, business growth, and so forth. The one school which tried to further this goal, the already- mentioned American institutionalists, have not been entirely successful by most accounts; but the shape and extent of their attempt may prove suggestive. The progenitor of this school, Thorstein Veblen, spear- headed a social theory of value in his first published volume, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Often underrated as a mere satirical social commentary, the book is, in fact, a disguised critique of the neoclassical utilitarian theory of value and a sketch of the outlines of an alternative. Everyone has heard of Veblen's neologisms such as "conspicuous consumption" and "absentee ownership"; but few seem to remember that the theme of the book was to drive a wedge between utility and usefulness, waste and inefficiency, science and pecuniary calculation. He did this by turning the contemporary fascina- tion with Social Darwinism on its head, claiming that the major function of the affluent class was to develop forms of cultural waste that would demonstrate its affluence; that the "instinct of emulation" then prompted the rest of the culture to imitate that wastefulness, albeit in less extravagant ways; and that the</page><page sequence="16">704 SOCIAL RESEARCH whole system was largely impervious to changes in the underlying pragmatic values of the provision of basic necessities and the technological imperatives of efficiency. Veblen saw waste everywhere, from manicured lawns replete with animal statuary as the pastoral nostalgia of the "dolicho- blond races" to the prevention of married women working in any effective economic capacity or the ceremonial officiousness of higher education. Competition was excoriated as a vestigial holdover of a ceremonial warrior class of hunting societies. And of course, the wine snobs came in for their share of opprobrium: [A member of the leisure class] must also cultivate his tastes, for it now becomes incumbent upon him to discriminate with some nicety between the noble and the ignoble in consumable goods. He becomes a connoisseur in creditable viands of various degrees of merit, in manly beverages and trinkets, in seemly apparel and architecture, in weapons, games, dances and narcotics.20 Perhaps wine newsletters had not yet come on the scene by 1900. To many, this smacked of nothing more than the crank complaints of a curmudgeon alienated from his own culture; but there was method to this apparent madness. Veblen's point was that nothing was purchased merely for its ostensible efficacy in the use intended; each and every purchase was a statement about the individual engaging in the transaction, meant as a signification of that person's place in the culture's scheme of valuation. As he insisted, "In strict accuracy, nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of invidious pecuniary comparison ... it is not necessary that it should be recognized as waste in this sense by the person incurring the expenditure." If this were not an argument from an intentionalist stance, who or what would provide the indepen- 20 Veblen, Theory of the Leisure Class, p. 64.</page><page sequence="17">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 705 dent benchmark against which waste could be gauged? In his later books, it seemed that Veblen thought this would be provided by the "industrial process" or even by the class of engineers; but the Theory of the Leisure Class admits that "Any consumer who might, Diogenes-like, insist on the elimination of all honorific or wasteful elements from his consumption, would be unable to supply his most trivial wants in the modern market."21 At this crucial juncture, the institutionalist theory of value faltered, because however much Veblen might ridicule the scientism and physics envy of neoclassical economics, his own dependence upon the metaphor of the machine as final arbiter of efficiency and waste was equally at risk. The undeveloped insight of his first book is that semiotic elements are inextricably entangled in the efficacy and use of any commodity, and therefore maximization of any notional utility is persistently compromised by context and thus violates the neoclassical image of law-governed behavior inherited from physics. In any valuation, the personal and the social are endlessly layered between acts of interpretation and significa- tion. The buck stops nowhere, not in the neural cortex, not on the hard edges of the machine, not in biology, not in physics. Were someone to search for the real waste, the real need, the secret independent life of the commodity, the objective meaning of value, he or she would not be able to find it, because there would be no way of arriving at anything other than a transient common ground. Veblen's writings did give rise to a tradition which sought after the meaning of such a construction of social value. Consistent with this position, Benjamin Anderson denied that value could simply consist of the physical ratios of commodi- ties, but he encountered great difficulty in specifying what it 21 Ibid., pp. 79, 113.

Commons achieved somewhat greater success by exploring the legal system as a major locus of the definition and stabilization of the concept of value in a market economy. Yet this school became identified with an activist political stance and advocacy of the case-study method, and in a period increasingly enamored with mathematical modeling and statistical testing, his followers were tarred with the epithet of naive empiricism.23 In short, the institutionalist program ran aground on the reef of relativism, and forfeited any claim to discuss invariance and conservation principles; and as we have already said, to forfeit value theory is to abstain from any participation in the inquiry called economics. Once one is buoyed upward by the insight that value is contingent, hermeneutic, negotiable, and nonnatural, then one must perforce drop anchor at some fixed point, if only to restore a sense of balance and a semblance of rationality amid the giddiness. After all, the actual economic transactors are not paralyzed by nausea but seem to go about their business with some degree of equanimity, albeit distracted now and then by some abrupt heave or eddy. To explain this state of affairs is the task awaiting a fully developed social theory of value. The point of embarkation for a retrofitted social theory of value is a recognition that it should be tethered to the pervasive thought structures in a market economy. Since value is about conservation principles and invariants, it will most probably resemble those same structures in natural science and in art. In each sphere there are not one but many realities which do not exist in solipsistic isolation but maintain some communication across widely variable cultural contexts. In art history, the invariants across cultural traditions of realistic representation have recently been formulated as differences in metric 22 Anderson, Social Value, pp. 21 et seq. 23 Philip Mirowski, "The Measurement Without Theory Controversy," Economies et Socittis, serie Oeconomia, no. 11, 1989, pp. 65-87.</page><page sequence="19">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 707 geometries used by the artist to express the experience of sampling the visual invariants in the process of observation.24 As one moves around an object, or moves one's head from side to side, or regards the object in light or in shade, there are a number of ways one can conceptualize the aspects of the object which remain invariant. A metric transformation will preserve all properties of the figure except locale and orientation; similarity transformations also give up size invariance; affine transforms relinquish angular invariance as well; while projective transformations only preserve straight lines and betweenness. To stress one or another class of transforms is to stress a particular kind of invariance; and yet all can be regarded as attempts to realistically describe or portray the object. What is fascinating from the perspective of comparative art history is that differing realist traditions in different cultures may be classified according to the corresponding treatment of invariance. Some "primitive" art may not treat planes as parallel to the picture frame, while imposing parallel projec- tions from a single point; they may or may not treat the observer as occupying a privileged position in the portrait. None of this is "wrong" from some Olympian point of view, for, indeed, even the photograph only preserves the invariants of a similarity transformation. However, "the pictures most familiar to the Western post-Renaissance observer are those that contain the fewest invariants . . . the invariants captured in those pictures are exactly those that remain invariant across subjective movement of the observer."25 Much the same situation holds with regard to the Western post-Renaissance treatment of value; its cozy consistency allows us to feel at home with our own portraits of ourselves as realistic economic actors. 24 Margaret Hagen, Varieties of Realism (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986). 25 Ibid., p. 104.</page><page sequence="20">708 SOCIAL RESEARCH Let us return once more to our three basic value questions. Starting with the first, what renders commodities commensu- rate in an economic sense in a social theory of value? From this perspective, there is nothing "in the commodity" or in the powers of the individual mind which accounts for the rules of value classification. Instead, the identity of the commodity is continually constructed and deconstructed and reconstructed in the process of market operation.26 From a strictly utilitarian viewpoint, no two supposedly generic goods are exactly identical: this apple has a bruise, that one is coated with some bizarre stuff to make it shiny, this one is worm-ridden; that one is genetically engineered to look and taste like a wax model; this one over here is stunted, that one is inconveniently located over in the next bin. To claim they are "identical" is to ignore the role of interpretation on the part of the individual observer. The way that commodities have come to be measured has a very strange and circuitous history.27 The earliest market- oriented measures of vendible objects were directly tied to particular personalities: the ell, the foot, and even the pound were not standardized across individuals; the lord of the demesne might define a bushel of grain differently for different people; the unit of landholding might be denomi- nated by the area a particular person could plow in a "day." Often markets were administered by customary authorities who might allocate stores in times of dearth by altering the chosen unit of measure (say, the loaf) instead of the price. 26 Those who catch a whiff of the attitudes of the later Wittgenstein should trust their noses. See also Douglas, How Institutions Think, p. 58: "It is naive to treat the quality of sameness, which characterizes members of a class, as if it were a quality inherent in things or as a power inherent in the mind." On the connection between "following a rule" and the attribution of identity, see Philip Mirowski, "Mathematical Formalism and Economic Explanation," in Mirowski, ed., The Reconstruction of Economic Theory (Norwell: Kluwer-Nijhoff, 1986). 27 Witold Kula, Measures and Men (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 198b) and Samuel Macey, The Dynamics of Progress: Time, Method and Measure (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1989).</page><page sequence="21">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 709 Needless to say, such measures could not be subject to the modern operations of addition and division. The first assertion of a modern social theory of value is that the attributes of a commodity which are to be treated as relevant to market activity are themselves socially constructed, in the sense that the mathematical prerequisites of an abstract algebra are socially imposed upon some arbitrary subset of the entire constellation of phenomenological peculiarities found there, in order to endow that category with an "identity" (in the multiple senses of that word) and to prepare the way for its formal subsumption under the structures of value. One cannot look to economists or economic historians to tell this story; but here the anthropologists have led the way. Mary Douglas has a fascinating chapter where she describes the radical shift from the nineteenth-century French classifications of wine so dependent upon geographical distinctions and self-constituted committees of vintners, to the industrialized twentieth-century California classifications nominally based upon "type" of grape, itself a hodgepodge of historical considerations.28 Nature cannot tell us what we are buying, which may explain why econometric equations fit over long stretches of time have such a wretched record of predictions. This process is not some vague Hegelian manipulation by the Geist or any such other ghost in the machine, but rather the outcome of specific social structures which intend that explicit result, ranging from the apprenticeships of the medieval guild to the enforced standardization of machine manufacture to the modern cajolery of advertising. In contrast to neoclassical economics, we do not come into the world hard-wired for commodity space; the space in which prices will be defined is fluid, impermanent, and initially hostile to mathematical expression. The "unnatural" character of the commodity is reinforced by the insight which dates back to John R. Commons that the 28 Douglas, How Institutions Think, pp. 102-109.</page><page sequence="22">710 SOCIAL RESEARCH objects traded in the market are rights rather than physical entities, although the two may coincide in various instances.29 This insight has been expanded and formalized in the writings of David Ellerman, particularly with respect to the employ- ment relation and the institution of double-entry accounting.30 Rights themselves present the semiotic problem in spades, given that they are persistently objects of contention in the marketplace and elsewhere, requiring endless intervention and adjudication by a constituted legal structure. Hence, as is so frequent in modern social-science literature, institutions should not be conflated with rule structures; rather, institu- tions provide the invariants so that rules may have some rational interpretation. Yet, even after all these preliminaries, we have still not adequately answered the question of what renders commodi- ties commensurate, having only just concerned ourselves with their definition as commodities qua commodities. For many neoclassical, beginning with Walras, the process of mensura- tion was thought to validate that of commensuration, in the sense that any commodity could be arbitrarily chosen as numeraire and thus used to express the value of any other commodity. However, this presumption was based upon the hidden prior assumption of the utility or field theory of value; when we relinquish dependence upon such invariants in the mind, it is no longer apparent that value is merely a ratio of arbitrary commodities, as noted implicitly by Veblen and explicitly by Anderson. Another way of putting the problem is this: Why must any particular bilateral trade have any significant implications for any other bilateral trade? How can any trader keep track of his gain or loss? Or to put it more 29 John R. Commons, Institutional Economics (New York: Macmillan, 1934), pp. 58 et seq. 30 David Ellerman, "Property Appropriation and Economic Theory," in Mirowski, Reconstruction of Economic Theory; see also his "Myth and Metaphor in Orthodox Economics," in the forthcoming symposium on postmodernism in the Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics.</page><page sequence="23">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 711 formally, why should it ever be the case that we can calculate prices papxppyxpyb=pciS&gt; where a, (3, 7, 8 index different standardized bundles of commodity rights, as discussed in the previous paragraph? A social theory of value would frame this problem using the formalism of abstract algebra.31 In any supposedly pure barter economy, any given trade has absolutely no fixed significance for any subsequent trade, mainly because there subsists no stable identity or benchmark against which trades may be compared. What is required is a transpersonal index of gain and loss, which will serve as the identity element in the algebra of exchange. Money, by its very nature a socially constructed institution, performs this function and thus renders the price system an algebraic field, in the language of modern algebra. In the presence of money, we observe a set (of prices) subject to two operations: addition (with identity zero) and multiplication (with identity unity, the monetary unit). This imposes mathematical structure upon the problem of value, to wit: the prices of different commodities may be added and subtracted, something not guaranteed by their socially constituted individual definitions (can pounds of hamburger be added to hours on a Caribbean island?); and that trade is initially treated as though it were a reversible process. The algebraic character of market exchange embodies a set of reified principles which we only have to list in order to show that they are social conventions: (1) The commodity preserves its identity through the exchange process. (2) Buying nothing costs nothing. (3) The order in which items are presented for purchase does not influence the sum total paid for them. (4) Dividing the aggregate into subsets and purchasing each separately should not influence the sum total paid. (5) If an item is bought and then returned to the seller, the net result should be zero. 31 Mirowski, "Mathematical Formalism," esp. pp. 209-235.</page><page sequence="24">712 SOCIAL RESEARCH (6) Everyone should pay the same price for the same item. Of course, none of these prescriptions are strictly true; but we did warn the reader of this strange trait of conservation principles at the beginning of this paper. Nothing in human life is strictly invariant or symmetric; yet, for purposes of quantification and the attribution of causal efficacy, something must be treated as conserved. This is the role of the monetary unit in a market system. A social theory of value answers the second value question by rooting the quantitative character of market trade in the phenomenon of money. Hence, in a very narrowly defined sense, in a social theory of value money is the embodiment of value; but precisely because it is socially instituted, its in variance cannot be predicated on any "natural" ground, and must continually be shored up and reconstituted by further social institutions, such as accountants and banks and governments. The possibility of a mutual gain of value in a market is ultimately explained by something that has been resisted and denounced throughout the entire history of Western economic thought, namely, the expansion of the volume of the monetary unit through debt creation- the phenomenon that breaks the value symmetry and acknowl- edges the existence of irreversibility of trading schemes through time. This shows up at the level of the individual transactor as the expansion of assets which offsets the newly created liabilities in their own balance sheet over time. This model can be formally specified as an algebra rooted directly in the legal structures of the particular society.32 The constitution of the monetary invariant through certain reified structures of exchange and its deconstruction by means of the persistent expansion of value through debt and its twin, profit, create an inherent tension both for the actors and for the theorist of social value. For the actors, there is no guarantee that the expansion of the monetary unit will not 32 Ellerman, "Property Appropriation"; see also David Ellerman, "Arbitrage Theory," SIAM Review 26 (1984): 241-261.</page><page sequence="25">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 713 result in the phenomenon of runaway inflation and the breakdown of the entire market system. The institutions that bear responsibility for the integrity of the monetary unit are thus always at odds with the actors intent upon the expansion of their own balance sheets.33 Modern markets are the arena of an endless struggle of the actors to get "something for nothing" and of the institutions of governance to preserve the relative in variance of the value unit; it is the bane of the latter that, if they were completely successful, they would banish all profit, which would of course undermine the political viability of the system. Therefore, in a social theory of value, society is precariously perched on the cusp of a contradiction: Pretend something is conserved when it is not, for the alternative is chaos. It is not for mere ornamentation that our currency is graced with the motto "In God We Trust." As the actors live with these tensions, so must the economic theorist live with his. Our third value question asks how the metaphorical structures in our culture serve to buttress the palpably false but pragmatically useful conservation principles. A revised social theory of value would answer by making reference to the history of economic thought covered in the previous section of this paper. Note well that every dominant school of economic thought in Western history has strenuously denied that money constituted value, and instead substituted some physical metaphor, such as the substance or the field, to ground value in the natural. This has not been mere ideology; rather, in those social formations, the radical indeterminacy of value for the actors has been rendered tolerable by insisting that value conformed to the images and structures of stable, determinate, objective causality dominant in that particular era. This legitimation process worked well in these early stages of 33 This explains, as neoclassicism cannot, the fundamental flaw in the Austrian position that even the monetary unit can somehow be created and sustained by a disembodied market competition. See, for example, George Selgin, The Theory of Free Banking (Totawa, N.J.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988).</page><page sequence="26">714 SOCIAL RESEARCH economic theory; nevertheless, the social- value theorist would differentiate his program by insisting that the time is ripe in fin de siecle Western culture finally to admit the contingent and constructed nature of value.34 The appropriate response to the previous sequence of failed attempts to ground value in physical metaphor is not to search for a new improved physical metaphor, but instead to observe that the process of market exchange is its own justification, and to acknowledge that our understanding of the economy should be more on a par with our understanding of art history, and that the inherent indeterminacy of value is an excellent structure for the reconciliation of change to invariance. Let me briefly outline the structure of this alternative model based upon a social theory of value, avoiding the more technical aspects.35 Suppose we have arrived at an historical juncture where commodity identities regularly undergo the sorts of stabilization described above, and that well-defined monetary relations reign in a particular geographical locale. Market actors are busily engaged in attempting to expand their balance sheets, setting money prices in their particular nexus in order to attain that result. Competition exists in the sense that all actors explore various local "paths" of exchanges in order to arrive at good 7 beginning with good a, calculating the net gains and losses in money along each individual path. The activity of self-interested calculation induces pressure for the entire economy to approach an "arbitrage-free" state, which is one where the value unit is conserved in trade, where the six market conventions listed above hold, and the accounting conventions of double-entry records are exactly mimicked on the level of the economy as a whole. 34 Some signs of the modern embrace of the contingent and constructed may be found in Richard Rorty, Contingency, Irony and Solidarity (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989) and Ernan McMullin, ed., Construction and Constraint (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988). 35 Some of the mathematical issues are discussed in Philip Mirowski, "Post- Modernism and the Social Theory of Value," Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="27">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 715 Nevertheless, the economy never actually attains that arbitrage-free state, because profit exists, and calculations are always being made with prices which are not themselves arbitrage-free.36 This fact is not a folktale of the economic theorist but is also known by the actors, and as a consequence they regard value not as a deterministic point but a stochastic phenomenon. Calculations are carried out according to rules of thumb; deals are never done till they're done; rights are never fully specified; asset values are never completely reevaluated. Citing the stochastic character of trade may appear to paint calculation with a thinly disguised veneer of objective causality, namely, the axioms of probability; but here is where the social theory of value takes the constructive position to its logical conclusions. There is a school of thought concerning probability which denies the existence of an objective definition of probability, and instead suggests that numerical assignments of chances are entirely due to idiosyncratic choices by individuals. What renders these choices somewhat coherent is the condition referred to in this literature as the "No Dutch Book" argument.37 Briefly, if any individual is willing to contract a series of bets corresponding to his own idiosyncratic assign- ment of probabilities, and the ensemble does not conform to the standard (Kolmogorov) axioms of probability, then it will be possible to make a Dutch Book against him: that is, a series of money wagers such that the bookie will win a positive amount no matter what the outcome. The No Dutch Book argument then goes: Since persistent monetary loss will be avoided by most actors, people are forced to conform to the 36 This dynamic problem of pricing is very similar to the notion of "false trading" in neoclassical general-equilibrium theory, with the exception that the neoclassical pretend to compare actual prices to a single equilibrium state, whereas here we accept the existence of numerous arbitrage-free configurations with no privileged natural benchmark. The mathematical formalism of the arbitrage-free condition can be found in Ellerman, "Arbitrage Theory," and Mirowski, "Post-Modernism." 37 See the classic text in this school by Bruno de Finetti, Theory of Probability (New York: Wiley, 1970).</page><page sequence="28">716 SOCIAL RESEARCH "laws" of probability under pain of certain loss. Of course, as has been repeatedly retorted, the entire argument hinges upon a stable value index in order to calculate the divergence of unfettered subjective probabilities from the stable axiomatic structure. Here is where the social theory of value consolidates the social-contructivist position. It agrees with the subjectivist theorist that "There is no such thing as probability," resisting the common tendency to assert people are hard-wired for stochastic calculation. Instead, whatever the source of the indeterminacy, actors are again socially induced to converge upon certain invariants in market calculation, whether they understand them or not. Yet we have just observed that money itself provides only a provisional invariant for market calculation, and that its in variance is a necessary condition for the No Dutch Book condition. Hence the system is shot through with contingency: probability calculations depend upon value invariance for their consistency, but the system of value depends upon the probability axioms for its calculation. The entire system is like an archetypical Escher print, where stairs and pillars mutually buttress an elaborate interconnected edifice, but no part of the edifice ever touches the ground. Can we live with the knowledge that value rests ultimately upon metaphor, that is, ultimately upon itself? Contrary to first impressions, this in not a nihilistic doctrine. This can be illustrated by the fact a social theory of value can be extended to connect previously far-flung social and economic analyses. For instance, Alvin Gouldner's long meditation on the "norms of reciprocity" fits comfortably into this framework.38 So likewise do Michael Thompson's three analytical categories of the transient, the durable, and rubbish in value theory.39 It is 38 Gouldner, For Sociology. 39 Thompson, Rubbish Theory. Transient commodities are those whose value is societally expected to decline over time; durables in this definition have anticipated rising value; and "rubbish" is everything which is thought to have no place in the scheme of values. Thompson believes that he has discovered regularities in the way</page><page sequence="29">THE MEANING OF A DOLLAR 717 consistent with modern models of empirical psychology which attempt descriptions of how individuals arrive at their decisions.40 In contrast with neoclassical economic theory, which is crassly imperialistic in attempts to displace the other social sciences, the social theory of value couples and resonates with a century or more of work in anthropology, sociology, and psychology to develop explanations of how various social structures constitute themselves as homeostatic entities. It comes not to conquer, but rather to show how value can be an organizing principle in the discourse of the self-determination of man. The era has passed when neoclassical can blandly assert that there are no palatable alternatives to their own epicyclic social physics.41 It is possible to combine mathematical rigor with a sensitivity to historical contingency; to combine semiotic concerns with the talisman of number; to subsume money and morals; to combine the language of rights and duties with the recognition of the constructed nature of social order; to reconcile individual freedom with social determination. All it takes is a willingness to give up the persona of the scientific arbiter of taste (in wine or otherwise) and the wizard of constrained optimization in a clockwork market. various objects pass between the categories, allowing the monetary system the flexibility to expand or contract its boundaries and reconcile some of the contradictory connotations of value in our culture. In this respect, his work marks a return to the concerns of Veblen. 40 "Agreement will be much easier to achieve by negotiators who trade in 'bargaining chips' that are valued equally, regardless of whose hand they are in. In this mode of trading, which may be common in routine purchases, loss aversion tends to disappear" (A. Tversky and R. Kahneman, "Rational Choice and the Framing of Decisions," in Hogarth and Reder, Rational Choice, p. 78). 41 See, for instance, David Kreps, A Course in Microeconomic Theory (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 119. * The author would like to thank Robert Heilbroner for helpful comments.</page></plain_text>
