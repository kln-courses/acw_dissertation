This " Ordinance" becomes more emphatic as we remember that, at the time, eh: a.d. 60, Saint Paul—himself a Pharisee of Pharisees, and always holding himself to his own Rule—was yet the Apostle of the Gentiles, and first Champion of the Liberties of the Gentile Church. Saint Peter was still in trust of "the Gospel of the Circumcision," i.e. in partibus—Apostle of the Jeivisk Christians outside Palestine—chiefly up the Euphrates Valley, from Babylon to the Black Sea ; the main line of hiland intercourse between East and West:—Saint Paul working chiefly among the learned and commercial Cities of the Mediterranean Coast. Saint James and the rest of the Apostles still kept to Palestine; and hardly approved Saint Peter's sympathy with Paul and Barnabas; whose Work they accepted much more freely than their View s. The omitted portion of the " Ordinance," relating to Social Eule, will be expanded in our " Social Principles."

Our " Articles" are not Tests of Doctrine or Belief; such as each separate Communion finds requisite, if only for its own Protection. Our members are of All Communions ; and Each is pledged to be true and loyal to His Own. Our Work underlies them all, and aims at deepening both their Spirit and Foundations. It honours the special character, and energies, and work of each; and rejoices in the healthy emulation which stirs us all " to love, and to good works;" while, by repudiating and denouncing Proselytism, as irreligious and unchristian; it seeks to remove the jealousies, suspicions, bitterness, due, only too obviously, to that Misdirection of Charity and Zeal. There is only too much room, and too much work, for all Communions in " converting" men, not from " their religion," hut from their irreligion—from vice to virtue, from sinfulness to God; from all that is careless, injurious, and offensive, to all that Holiness and Heaven approve. No doubt, all true Beligion tends to assimilate men to Christ and His Apostles:—but even among these our Lord marked and emphasized the largest differences. In His Social Body, the Church, no two functions—nay, no two members—are alike, or could, if so, fulfil their offices; and its great Limbs or Branches will probably, to the last, differ as widely as the regions they embrace, or the varied Institutions they inspire and purify. It is from " that which every joint supplies*' that the Whole grows up to Him, making increase of itself in love. Uniformity is the unnatural dream of a false and vain Philosophy: the Wisdom of Christ lies nearer hand—The Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace. No one, therefore, is bound to these, or to any of our Expositions; not even their Authors; any more than a Writer on any large and difficult Subject is bound never to revise, correct, or improve his Statements. All true Science grows; and though, as it grows, it learns to simplify itself ; yet each simpli¬ fication becomes in turn but the broader base of a more powerful develop¬ ment, with applications diverse and inultiplied. Especially, this must be with that out-comprehending Science which embraces aud expands them All in the real feeling of Infinity. Ours are only thoughtful Tentatives, or Helps to Doctrine :—shoit Essays adapted to the time and need :—our most careful endeavour to go to the root of each Essential Question—especially</page><page sequence="6">of those which now agitate the Church—and to state, reverently and cou¬ rageously, whatever we can discern in its elucidation. Of course, we revere and follow all just Authority ; but by no means slavishly ; and our appeal is, in the last resort, to the Common Sense, and Common Sympathy, of Christendom. Our subjects are, of course, the Central ones: those fundamental to present needs; but many of them, obviously, must he expanded in the " Homilies ;" only bare outlines can be given here. Many are omitted ; and we avoid all negative criticism ; finding fault with nothing where we cannot set a Better n its place. We dwell, more fully than is usual in Religious Articles, on Natural, or even Physical, and Social Facts ; for it is in this direction mainly, and quite justly, as we believe, that modern Inquiry tends ; and, with inquiry, Thought. Our Tentatives would fain combine its Insight with the best Conceptions of the past; some of them, perhaps, hitherto too dominant— especially those derived from the premature philosophy of Paganism. Article 1. FAITH. Like Religion, Faith is threefold—Intellectual, Social, Spiritual—and in each its definition is " Insight of the Invisible;" with corresponding senti¬ ments. 1. " Doctrinal" only differs from any scientific Insight in being more thorough and comprehensive. It cannot be content with one side or aspect of a thing; but must try to see it all, and compare it with all else it knows. It soon transcends common thought, therefore, and insists on viewing every¬ thing in its true relation to the Divine. Of this, all its finites and infinites soon become points and facets; nay, signs and sacraments. Wherever it rests it finds a Bethel, and a ladder to the skies. Creeds and Confessions, also, as supposed to embody this more-than- scientific Insight, are also commonly called " the Faith." 2. Social, or '•Ecclesiastical" Faith, is this Insight as applied to Society; or to any Section of it—its Constitution, Communion, Ties, Charities, and Purpose. Its main element, therefore, is the Heart or Sentiments ; and it aspires, with Hope, to lose itself in Love. These build up the " Household of Faith," and attach us to it; whatever sins against it, or against them, is '• Schism." 3. Spiritual, or "Living" Faith, is that which, through every invisible, insists on reaching The Invisible Himself; and then, at one with Him, would breathe, into all His Family, His Everlasting Gospel. In all its forms, Faith is the Personal Engine of The Holy Ghost, and the Birth-Angel of all Higher Life.</page><page sequence="7">Article 2. THE CREEDS AND THEIR INFALLIBILITY. The Creeds are the Central Product of Doctrinal Faith ; embodying and expanding the Baptismal Formula. The First arose in the Apostles' lifetime; due to the first expansion of the Gospel—Initial, Original, Hebrew, or Apostolic Christianity—that of the first Century, as pictured for us in the New Testament Scriptures. The other two are of the fourth century ; due to the primary development of the Gentile Church—Primary, " Early," Hellenic, or Eastern Christianity—of an acute, inquisitive, and argumentative, rather than a virtuous, or even a really thoughtful or comprehensive Spirit; and one which, despite the Apostolic warnings, while developing its Doctrine, but frittered away, or disputed away, the Substance of Religion. Secondary, Medieval, Latin, or Western Christianity modestly accepted, as had been always the custom of the West, " the Greek Models," upon Authority, and almost without discussion: - To Organize, and to Re-organize, Society, for Christ, was Its much harder Work. What our present Tertiary Christianity will produce—call it Teutonic, English, American, what you will—it remains to see. On the clearest Scriptural Authority," brought to remembrance" by the necessities of the Church, we humbly suggest the following Additions to the Nicene Creed. (a) To " By Whom all things were made ;" add "In Whom all Consist, and all are Reconciled." (b) To " Who spake by the prophets;" add " Who inspires all Words, and animates all Works, of God." (c) To "One Catholic and Apostolic Church;" add "With its Scriptures, Old and New, and its Sacraments in their order." (d) To " I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins;" add " And one Communion of the Self-Sacrifice [or Body and Blood ?] of Christ." And these Alterations in the Athanasian. (e Instead of the first two versicles ; these— Whosoever wishes to be saved : let him learn and hold the Catholic Faith, To enlighten his Understanding: and guide Ins Heart and Soul. (/) " Furthermore, it is essential to just Doctrine: that he believe rightly, &amp;c, &amp;c." (g) This is the Catholic Faith: essential for our Instruction; And taught by the Spirit: through the Scriptures and the Church. [The damnatory clause on " doing evil" being left unchanged.]</page><page sequence="8">One addition, too, seems desirable— (h) "But the whole Three Persons are Co-eternal, Co-equal:" Co-essential, and alike Divine. And perhaps, in the preceding versicle, the words " to us" should be inserted—" And in this Trinity, none is to us afore, &amp;c, &amp;c." For though this affirmation be true, as regards us or Creation, it is not true of the Divine Persons, as compared together. The Father is essentially Higher, and, in Order, Prior, to Son or Spirit—God- Ultimate, to His Self-Manifestation, and to His Exerted and Imparted Energies. And we observe— On (a)—See Col. i. 17, sqq.,&amp;c. " Consist" is the most accurate term for the Son, as God's Manifestation, or Embodiment—" God-in-things," Emmanuel. " In the Father, all things subsist:" are sustained and based, and thence originate. " In the Son, all consist:" are Constituted, and Exhibited in Form and Meaning. " In the Holy Ghost, all exist:" come forth into exertive energies, and unconscious, conscious, self-conscious, "Life." Many German Schools have learned to distinguish the First and Last; but they still forget the Second—naturally, as high-flown Idealists; incipient Nihilists :—If we cannot, logically, see the Visible, What can we see The broad, all-searching, all-purifying Reconcilement—here and often expounded by St. Paul; as often, and perhaps more impressively and profoundly, unfolded by St. John, and others ; and seen more dimly by all the Prophets from the beginning—is obviously essential to any just conceptions of God, of Christ, of Christianity, or of Religion. On (c)—Both the Scriptures, and the Sacraments as such, should be mentioned in the Creeds; and co-ordinately, as being the Centres of the two essential Functions of the Church—the Prophetical and the Priestly. And both are "infaUible," too; though not in the present shallow sense of that profound expression. Its real meaning is that Faith, The Church, and the Bible—like any other large Sections or Volumes of God's Work: in Nature, Providence, or Grace—are " so Profoundly True on the Whole, as not only (1) to throw into insignificance their own small aberrations or defects ; but also (2) to throw these same defects into significance again—as indications of our present learning or progressive state—and invite, or almost force, us to fellow-work with Each of them, in the Spirit of Its Mission"—thus, mani¬ festly, making them subserve Its Purpose and our Advance. And, on (/)—How little Hellenism really apprehended of either Son, or Spirit, or, therefore, of The Father, appears every where:—even in the omissions (a) and (6)—obviously essential to their Deity—as compared with the showy sentences preceding; and some of which,indeed, in their Hellenic sense, are barely true. While its vain and unchristian over-estimate of its own doctrinal handiwork is as conspicuous in its additions to the Athanasian ; which have actually forced some Protestant Communities, as the American and Irish, despite their well-known Hellenic leanings, to omit that Creed</page><page sequence="9">altogether. We accept and honour the Hellenic Doctrine : we would gladly forget the rest. If it have been necessary for the Great Gentile Church—like the Jewish, or like each of us—to acquire, in succession, the Three Prime Desiderata of the New Creation—Knowledge, Righteousness, True Holiness —its Greek Development at least only attained the First. Article 3. OF GOD; AND ESPECIALLY OF THE FATHER. There is one God : The I AM: Essence, Base, and Author of all Being :— Creator, Sustainer, Director, Reconciler, Judge, of All things Visible and Invisible; Infinite, Eternal, and Unchangeable—as comprehending within Himself, and having always^resent to Him—in Space, Time, Cause, Sympathy —all beings and doings whatsoever. Almighty, All-wise, All-pure, All-good; out-embracing in His Fulness all life, substance, relations, attributes; and In and From Whom all " beings" have whatever being they possess. And in this Godhead we distinguish Three "Persons," or " Co-essentials of Self-Conscious Being"—The Father : in whom are all things and attributes implicitly; The Son and Spirit, in whom they are made explicit—imparted to creatures; and seen, felt, known, articulately, in connected parts. Article 4. OF THE SON. The Word or Son of God is essentially His Self-Revelation; His Utterance, Expression, Manifestation of Himself in Things, which—by their exhaustless variety and change, on one hand ; their essential relationship and ascending order, on the other—set forth, declare, reveal, The Infinite and Inexhaustible- God-as-seen in History and Destiny, in Providence and Fact; God-present in life, and death, and rising again: and in all the Form, Constitution, Correla¬ tion, Purpose, Meaning, of the Seen and Unseen. Emmanuel, God in-Things, God-in-Creation—Becoming, therefore, and Ever-Becoming; " This day"— this Everlasting Day—" Begotten." And this Self-Expression of Deity is Itself in the highest sense Divine— (a) In its Totality, and Cosmic Harmony; or whatever best exhibits them ; and (6) In its Exemplar, or Archetypal Presence; brought home compendiously to our regards. We distinguish, therefore, in the language of Church and Scripture, Three several, yet essentially related Bodies, or Embodiments, of Christ. 1. His Personal Embodiment: the Individual Son-of-Man, who was born and crucified among us, and aseended before us to the Heavens—perfect in in our life; and first-born of our Resurrection. 2. His Social Embodiment: the Universal Church, now in process of formation; which Christ's Spirit animates, and His Person Heads. And</page><page sequence="10">8 3. His Cosmic Embodiment: in the Totality of things, visible and in¬ visible ; For in Him all things Consist, and all are Reconciled ; and in each or any of them may the Real Presence and Real Character of God and Christ be seen. In and through all these is even God-the-Father with us—creating, bearing, sympathising, raising, reconciling us to Himself—not imputing our trespasses to us, but taking them on Himself—and in and through these The Eternal Deity is sought, is found, is worshipped, and is—GOD. Of course, the Essential Characters of the Word, the Son, the Christ- as Mediating, Atoning, Reconciling—belong alike to Each Embodiment; and must not, by us, be confined to One. The First exhibits them expressly; the Second aspires to feel, and as it feels, to propagate, them ; but even the Third everywhere possesses them: and everywhere declares, preaches, parables, them to all who have ears to hear. In their Natural Revelation of God, we most aptly call them all " the Word ;" in their Social and Family nearness, "the Son;" and in their Self-Sacrificing, Redeeming, Assimilating Sympa¬ thies and Power, " the Christ." Article 5. OF THE HOLY GHOST. The Spirit of God is His Exerted Energies; His Pervading Powers of Life and Consciousness—from the humblest vires vivae of mere motion, to the highest organic motions, emotions, motives, of self-conscious, self-sacrificing, Love:—All the "living powers" which animate and mould the universe, conscious and unconscious; and build it up, in ascending embodiments, individual, social, cosmic, into the ever more fitting Likeness of the Father. The Spirit is always Creative, therefore; and as, in turn, God always makes His Creation to create, or fellow-create, with Him ; it follows that the Creative Spirit " proceeds" not only [immediately] from the Father; but also [mediately, manifestly, instrumentally, organically, in-the-way-of-second- means] from the Son. And the Highest Creative Spirit, known to things, will be always that of the Last and Highest Embodied Christ—such aB now animates, builds, and Sanctifies the Christian Church. And this Highest and eminently Personal Spirit, of course, " Characters" and Names the Whole. The universal, the humblest, and the highest " life of things" is, alike, The Holy Ghost, the Lord and Life-giver:—All "the same Spirit" distributing variously " as He will." In Genesis and Re-Genesis alike—from the birth of Light, and its Action in all that follows it; to the Fire of Pentecost, and all the formation and endowment of the Church ; and thence to the Genesis of the Spiritual Body, and all individual and social Construction in the Unseen—All, in fact, that moves in Nature, Providence, or Grace, is but the Breath or Spirit of The Living God:—All, therefore, ia Holy as Himself; and, by the same Spirit, we must find or make it so.</page><page sequence="11">9 Article 6. THE TRINITY. Thus the Trinity is simply God, God-Manifest, God-Exertive :—More fully (1), God Ultimate, Immediate, Absolute: who Originates, Rules, Wills, Conditions, and Determines All. (2) God Embodied or Expressed; Mediating, Instrumental, Historical, Developed and Developing, in Things. (3) God Operative, Generative, Regenerative, Energising, Animating, Inspiring All. Or, in Greek terms, God-Ontologic, God-Phoenomenal, God-Dynamical:— remembering, however—what some Greeks forgot, and many modems have failed to see—that the two latter are Ontologic also; or truly partake the "real-being" which they " exert" and " show"—else is the whole statement illusory or absurd. In the strangely confused language of modern thought, we may sometimes allow ourselves to say it thus : (1) God-Substantive, i.e., in the under-lying, scarcely common, meaning of " substance ;" (2) God- Objective, that which presents " objects" or "obstacles" to our senses, and analogous definite "forms" to any faculty; and (3) God-Subjective, in the sense that " subject" denominates our personal but intensely variable powers. Perhaps the most emphatic and expressive terms we have yet learned to use, are the usual—God-the-Father, God-the-Christ, and God-the-Holy-Spirit. And thus the Triune Doctrine is but our Analysis of the " Co-essentials of Real Being"—as discernible in ourselves, in things, in God—and is th Church Solution of the standing philosophic perplexity—Diversity-in-Unity, or The One and the Many:—namely, That the Many is An Exhibition of the One, and is evolved by Its Essential Energies. We say An, not The; for there may be " many ,-" and so utterly diverse as to be " incomprehensible" by Any—even independently of any infinity of mere Magnitude. [But our analysis, so far as it goes, is true of the most profound and inexhaustible Reality ; and independent of any mere abstract notions what¬ soever. Yet even the ideal and remote will contain the principle. Any Unit is divisible ad infinitum into fractions of itself; each of which, however infinitesimal, is also a unit, and equally so divisible, while still comprehended as a differential in the Unit. And this Unit itself, while out-comprehending all its own parts, with all their characters, relations, attributes, has also—as a Unit, not an Aggregate—Superior Characters, Relations, Attributes, of its own; not shared by any of its fractions, though these do possess their analogues. A Whole, as such, has always Characters, or a Constant, left behind in the differentiation ; and which must be restored in the Integration —else it is not the Whole.] It might he expressed in very many ways, for all real things truly share in these three Co-essentials; and any exhaustive examination of anything would immediately discover them. The humblest thing has (2) some [variable] " substance," using that word in the common meaning; and (3) some [still more variable] " force," or " forces." And, behind these both, it has (1) an [invariable] element of individuahty, identity, and law ; which bind it, irrevocably, to the Universal Relationship and Law of things, and</page><page sequence="12">10 make all its and their variations but express Its Character, in their own. As we ascend in the scale of things, the two variable elements become more complex and constituted ; and the invariable element becomes more distinct, self-conscious, and commanding ; until we reach Ourselves :—Where we find (1) one absolute, unvarying, inscrutable Personality ; (2) one constituted " Person;" and (3) one Personal System of " living powers;"—Or (1), our ultimate, unchanging Self; (2) our manifesting, mediating, organic, or instru¬ mental Self; and (3) our vital, exertive, emotive Self: with all its conscious and unconscious energies :—" and these three are one." Now, this is our " Image" of the Tri-Unity Above. It should be remembered, however, that this is but a human, and, there¬ fore, an anthropomorphic analysis. And it does not follow that, because all Being within our intelligence can be resolved into these three Co-essentials, therefore, all the Infinitude of Being can. The Infinite has these three Co-essentials, we know: for we can show them, distinctly and undeniably. But He may have others—or an infinity of others—quite as distinct and unresolvable as our three of Substance, Force, and Law; and we should define our doctrine accordingly, with modesty and caution. [Even into the Constant of our own Integration, we, differentials, cannot pretend to pierce.] Article 7. ON THE PERSONALITY OR FATHERHOOD OF GOD. The Personality and "Will" of God does not mean that He is a small, partial, " wilful," Individual; acting, or capable of acting, on sudden impulse, or in any arbitrary, unregulated, or ill-regulated manner—unforeknown, unforeshown, or undetermined from Eternity. Nor that He is a weak, well- intentioned, far-distant, " god ;" " interfering," or obliged to interfere, occasionally, with the " general course of nature," or the universal relation¬ ship and law of things ; in order to do some good; if only to " attest" his own existence or his character. Surely, all such notions, or positions which imply them, are unworthy of Theology. " They are adapted to us, children," it is said, " and useful to us :"—Yes, but the simpler Truth is better adapted, and much more useful;—namely, That His Personality consists in His true Fatherhood—which is not " out of all relation," but in all relation ; and com¬ prehends in Itself, imparts, imposes, sustains, and feels with—all relations and relationships whatever, and all those whom they Condition and Direct. So that "as a father pitieth his own children," so our Heavenly Father, truly and literally, pitieth All of His; and truly loves them, with all His Heart, even while He chastises, or finds it needful to destroy. But this is anthropomorphism Yes ; All our thoughts on every thing are always so. We are men: we have no other measure, of ourselves, of things, of God, except a man's. If we be true to it, and what it reaches, it will carry us into truth, and into The Truth, just as far as "man" can go. All beyond that is, to man, The Inconceivable. Which, however, man may be certain, is " of a piece" with his small portion: for his small portion is but a point or piece of It; and any Whole not only contains all its own parts, but " consists" with each of them.</page><page sequence="13">11 Has, then, God faculties like ours? Does He see, feel, think, like us? Yes, precisely like ours. For He has ours: and, without Him, Ours could not, even for an instant, be. But not ours only. Even in God-the-Son—He has all the faculties of all His creatures, visible and invisible; and has them all, with all their acts and action, past, present, and to come, for ever Present in His Everlasting Now ; out-comprehended in His all-embracing, all-sustain¬ ing Sympathies. It is Here that all partiality or caprice, all possibility of error or of change, all variableness of the all-loving, all-judging, all-purifying Will, disappear, and " vanish in the integration;" and leave us each, in every instant of our thought and action, face to face with The Unchangeable. But is there not a "special Providence" of God? Yes, a very special Providence; so special that nothing can escape it for an instant. His " tender care is over all His works ;" and He tends each, the least, of them, and all its ways and doings, just as intently and intensely as if He had nothing else whatever to attend. This is the meaning of Infinity or GOD. And the most Special Providence is simply the most Universal Providence—the most in¬ tensely specialized to the individual, and to the individual regards. The finite, because it is finite, finds it hard to realize this ; or even to discern it, except in an occasional glimpse or flash:—But this is the very thing we are sent here to learn. We call "Nature" all the works of God below the grade of Foresight, prudence, moral responsibility, or the sense of reward and punishment. All within that range we call " Providence;" up to the level of •' Grace ;" or, the distinct consciousness of Self and God, and of the necessity for Reconcilement, or " Atonement" between These Two. Nature, Providence, and Grace exhaust our view of Things ; and, in the aggregate, are named " Creation." Each of these has both a " Course" and " Constitution :" the Course being the Con¬ stitution developed into History ; the Constitution being the Course fore¬ shortened, or compressed into a Tableau. And all these, and every part of them, are not passive, but active, and in action; ail have an assimilating power, and do positively assimilate, to themselves, and therefore to God, all the elements they reach—preserving always the same Order in their Work. Article 8. ON CREATION. " Creating" is simply Producing, or Causing-to-Grow:—This is its just and proper meaning in Scripture, in the Apostolic Church, and in all just thought and language whatsoever. [Heb. bara, produxit, genuit; bar, filius; our awn bear, bairn; Lat./ero, fertilis,pario,parens, &amp;c.; Gk.ginomai,I become, come-into-being ; our own beg in ; gennao, causative, I cause-to-begin, beget; Lat. genesis, genius, (g)nascor, (g)natus, (g)natura, &amp;c.; creare, causative of crere, crescere, cause-to-grow; our own grow, great, increase, &amp;c] Other traditional or conventional meanings—as, sudden or spasmodic production, without natural steps or stages, or efficient antecedents in history; or making- out-of-nothing—are false and groundless ; and crept into the " Early" Church from the vainest and falsest side of the Greek philosophy—the Neo-Platonism underlying the Gnostic Heresies.</page><page sequence="14">12 God is Creator now, as He always was, and will be. He produced, and produces, All things from Himself :— [immediately] from His own Person¬ ality, Substance, Living Powers ; [mediately] from what He has already created and sustains; from His Self-Manifestation ; [His (Gk.) gignomenon, phainomenon, kai ontos on.] Each successive step or stage in His creation being always caused, in conjunction with all the preceding, to produce the next:—as the process is described, and " creation" itself, both word and thing, repeatedly defined, in the first chapters of Genesis. And hence the scale is an ascending one ; and the order of Dignity the inverse order of the Time ; as each successive Son is the resultant and the Heir of all that has preceded Him. And thus all Growth is upwards from below ; while the Seed, the planting of it, and the main stimulating energies, are given from above ; and the most "vital," or the fertile region, is the actual Surface where the Under and the Upper, the Mundane and the Heavenly, meet and mingle. All this, and such as this, proceeding always by invariable, yet living and elastic, Law; Index of His Eternal Character and Will, Who, while creating and sustaining, also Characters, Conditions, Out-conditions All, and is bound by No Condi¬ tions but—Himself. To outline Creation farther, some definitions are required. Let, then, (a) Space, Time, Force, Relation, Order, Causation, Sympathy, Destiny, &amp;c, be so many sides or facets of God's Omnipresence ; at once producing things, and keeping each to its place, work, purpose, &amp;c. And let (b) " Substance" be Whatever Occupies Space :—remembering (1) that all space-occupation known to us is extremely partial—all substances appearing to " act as vacua" to those of a different grade or order; some even, as gases, to those of a different species; and the particles or elements even of the solidest being but infinitesimal points, as compared with the intervals between them. And (2) that whatever shares in Space shares also, apparently, at least on their physical side, in all the other sides or aspects of the Omni¬ presence. And let (c) "Matter" be Sensible substance : that kind of substance which affects directly any of our senses, or is correlated with our present material bodies. Then we observe a. That the Material Universe is but an mfinitesimal, or an infinitesimal of the second order, as compared with the Substantial—is but, in fact, a scarce visible sprinkling of star-dust in that Substantial, yet Immaterial, Firmament which we can test; and which we cannot help believing is but a physical basis for other Universes, perhaps an infinity of them, which also, like ours, Occupy Space, and Interpenetrate each other. And that b. There is the gravest reason to believe that it holds an Intermediate Position, both in Constitution and History — and is in a transition or translation state—between such an " empyrean," or " inorganic immaterial," Universe, or Universes, below itself; and a " Spiritual," or " organic imma¬ terial," Universe, or Universes, above it, in creation's scale. That it is, in fact, the half-fertile, half-vital, rest-and-action, Surface in which these meet</page><page sequence="15">13 and mingle; the Sensible Birth-stage, or Gestation-stage—or, it may be, the Mother-and-Infant-stage—of Substance from one Gradation of Life and Feeling to a Higher. This certainly is the case, at least, with all material substance within our cognizance—and we can, almost or altogether, trace it, through all its tran¬ sition or transformation steps, from the one Condition to the other. 1. Thus Matter, we know, is Inorganic, Semi-organic, Organic, according to the class of vital energies contained—the second being the debris of the third, mixed with the higher grades of the first; and constituting the mother- matter, or active base, of vegetation; the " dust" of the earth, as distin¬ guished from, and carpeting its " crust." 2. Inorganic Matter is gaseous, liquid, solid, according to the amount of Heat, or molecular expansive power, combined; and will pass, back or for¬ ward, from one condition to the other, by its addition or subtraction; which can generally be done in one direction, by mere mechanical compression or concentration; and this is the dominant direction due to circumstances in these realms; that in which all the powers and transitions work most easily : —the forces involved being compressed, concentrated, and thereby transmuted, quite as distinctly as the substance; e.g., mechanic into thermal, thermal into luminous, luminous into permanent colour and chemical combination. 3. Organic Matter, though this is less understood, evidently undergoes like changes in the opposite direction, through its possession of the higher organic powers or faculties; which it holds, in ascending grades ; in intensely concentrated and educated forms; mostly in a static, constitutive, or resting state ; yet with an intense aspiration or ambition, and an amazing power, of expanding again, if only in occasional efforts ; and of—not, indeed, " anni¬ hilating space and time," which were as useless, or destructive, as it is impossible—but of embracing immense regions of them simultaneously, in mental or emotive grasp; and of concentrating themselves, at will, on any point required. 4. Now, a lofty Personality ; with just such versatile and comprehensive energies ; with a highly elastic, immaterial, yet substantial organism, within limits variable at will; with immense command over space and time, and a limited range of operation; is, and has always been, the common notion of a " Spirit." And we have not the slightest reason to deny, but every reason to surmise, that our New-Birth—the great Mysterious, feared, expected, hoped for, Angel of Futurity—will launch us in a Sphere of such, or such-like, Spiritual Beings; in regular and appointed manner; with all the resultant of our doings, for good or evil, stamped into our actual Character, with all essential consequences. 5. Indeed, if it be not so, it may be added, about the largest law of things within our ken will be distinctly violated—that of " creation" itself, growth, or "more-tban-conservation." Amid all these transitions and transmuta¬ tions, there is no real Destruction of either Substanee, Force, or Individuality; though all these elements are constantly being varied, subordinated, and rendered constitutive of larger, higher things. Why, then, should Personality,</page><page sequence="16">14 or " Self-Conscious Individuality," be destroyed; once it has been created, constituted, elevated, into the distinctest Image of the Maker The whole analogy of what we can discern in things negatives the supposition ; even had we no clearer intimation from within us or without. We have, indeed, every reason to believe that each Personality will be distinctly subordinated, and, with immense changes in, and additions to, its powers, rendered constitutive of some loftier Communion—of all which, foretastes, tentatives, and abundant analogues, surround us here. But this will no more lower the personality, or weaken the responsibilities involved; than is any man's individuality destroyed or weakened, by being subordinated, regulated, trained, educated, raised, employed, and rendered influential, through his " enlistment" in a corps. 6. On the other side of Matter, and in the opposite direction, the like observation must be made. Here, Substance is being compressed into matter, to be organized ; as there, it is expanded, beyond matter, organically. The gaseous elements, 60 or 70 in number, are in various states of conden¬ sation, inversely as their specific heat; and so related in qualities and groups, as to convince the thinker that they are all more or less concentrated and constituted forms of some more refined and subtle substance—some space- occupier beyond our sense; but not very difficult for thought to scan ; for it is the one substance constantly before our eyes, if only eyes could see it; and Science has been strangely slow in asserting its deeper Insight. 7. Our Orbs of Star-dust float in an Empyrean Ocean—"the ether of light and heat"—which keeps them all in immediate communion, and almost immediate communication; and which, if " solidity" be " resistance to com¬ pression," is not only the most universal and all-pervading, but also the solidest substance of our cognition. Altogether immaterial, however, and to us invisible, either in rest or action ; and only indirectly noted from its action bringing mateiial things within our sight and feeling. Out of this Ethereal, Empyrean, or "inorganic immaterial," Substance; with or without some intermediate stage; it is scarcely doubtful that all Matter has been, and is being, formed; by simple compression and concentration, due to its own undulations, or the orderly vibration of its points ; which, by some polar or magnetic action, when brought within each other's range, cohere together. So that our luminous orbs are but concentrations of the luminiferous ether they bespangle; rendered luminous by this very concentration; which has transmuted the static or constituent Heat into Light; and propagates it thence, an energetic and indispensable Agent in all the upward Genesis. Whoever ponders on these observations, whether he agree with them all or not, will feel that at least the two leading propositions of this Article, AandB, are fully justified—That our Whole Material Universe, namely, is, like our¬ selves, in transitu, in progressu; from unseen to Unseen; from a lower to a Higher state of Being ; and is Itself, with all its Progeny, a visible Birth-and- Baptism-Stage of Substance from one gradation to Another of the Conscious¬ ness of God. The starry curtain that trembles in the Firmament is, apparently, but a shining Surface in which the inorganic and organic meet, combine, and fructify—a luminous film or Veil, moving, with all its points, through Space, Time, Force, Relation, and the other Elements of The</page><page sequence="17">16 Omnipresence; and with a growing intelligence thereof. Through this Phoenomenal Time-Interval, each passes as he can ; from eternity to Eternity; being born and born anew amid such trouble, anguish, joy, as simply elicits, educes, educates, All the Energies and Sympathies we have. Such seems the Process of Creation, in the Unit and the Aggregate ; and " the First-Born of Every Creature," in each respect [art. 3] Embodies its Conditions. Article 9. ON FORCE OR LIFE. Substance, we have seen, is incessantly passing through Transitions:— La the inorganic realms, by mechanic and chemical " Transformation ;" in the lower organic, by what maybe fairly called " Transubstantiation"—as the living change of vegetable flesh into animal, of animal into human; and in the upper organic, by more potent and elastic " Transfiguration." Now, all these changes are wrought, and " commanded," by Force, or the Vital Energy Co-essential with Substance ; still more incessantly, rapidly, and totally, Mutable than it; yet more immediately Connected, in all its variations; and more easily felt to belong to the Fundamental Unity. And its "Transmu¬ tations" also proceed by grades or steps; in settled order; and much more easily from below upwards than vice versa ; although with a startling willing¬ ness, as each higher propagates itself, to descend and raise the rest—without which " encouragement," indeed, or upper stimulus from without, All Upper Genesis is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Its action also seems to depend so far on Concentration, and subsequent Expansion, that the rule is, that " Any natural force concentrated on a substance, beyond a certain pitch, will, and often with a sudden and per saltum change, transmute both the substance and itself; passing part of itself into a new and higher form, which will then propagate itself for higher usefulness; the new form and force having been produced at the point of intensest concentration." Such is the common Genesis of Light from Heat, for instance ; or of Heat from mechanic friction, compression, or collision ; and these are but the humblest examples of our series ; the law being quite as obvious, if more complicated, among the highest organic powers. It is quite wrong, therefore, to say Natura non facit saltum :—true, she loves not spasmodic action : this is always a symptom of disease; and she is always regular: whatever she does anywhere, she will always do—not indeed " the same ;" strictly speaking, there is no " same"—but " the like," in all like cases. But so little is it true that she never leaps, springs, bounds ; it is much more true that she never moves in any other manner—that all her life and action is by throbs, beats, pulses, or pulsations, in great and small; by vibrations, waves, working-days, repeated efforts of every kind, with steps or intervals between. The Elementary changes, indeed, are so minute as to escape our notice, and her main procedure is to us continuous or insensible ; but she often prepares for, and collects her energies into, a great Transition— a palpable Birth-Stage of her Progeny; and often Explodes her forces : as in the lightning flash or earthquake shock, suddenly and with violence. The</page><page sequence="18">16 analogues of all these are everywhere discernible; and on the largest scale. Nations, Churches, Dispensations, are born also, as well as suns or planets, or much smaller things; with quite as remaikable concomitants; and as decided intervals between. It should be remembered also that all the powers are " correlated," not only in Course, but equally so in Constitution ; and the general rule is this— " The simultaneous and proportionate Co-operation of all the powers from below upwards, with a certain stimulus or ' leading' from those above, is essential to any Natural Production." And a static condition of nature's forces, with a well marked resting-stage for each—and a profounder rest, or sense of rest, underlying and embracing all—accompanies and sustains even the intensest effort or exertion. We call all nature's life and action " unconscious," so far as it is without the feeling of pleasure or pain ; when this sensibility is added, as in animals, we call it " conscious;" and " self-conscious," when reflective or moral life is reached; when consequences are foreseen and weighed; and the responsibility felt of judgment and of choice. Article 10. OF LIBERTY, WILL, CHOICE, NECESSITY, AND LAW. Liberty is an essential attribute of Force; indeed, a side or aspect of it; quite as much so as Action. Any Thing is free, and free to act, so far as it has Force : Farther, it is not free ; not even free to rest :—except in a most partial sense, for its constitutional action goes on, and all other things are always acting upon it. A Person has more and more varied forces than a thing ; and, in respect to each of them, he is free—and free to act, speak, think, wish, will—so far as he has force for each of them, and no more. Each thing or person, then, is free, absolutely and entirely free, to do ichatever it can do ; and—to take the Consequences Here is the Necessity that surrounds, accompanies, limits, and conditions All. For, Each is not Alone. Individuals as we are, each only exists in, and by virtue of, his correlation or communion with the rest; and all the rest have their forces, and their freedom too ; and can, and will, and must react to every action. This necessity, obviously, rebolves itself at once into the Universal Com¬ munion, Correlation, or Relationship of Things; and brings us face to face with the all-embracing, all-balancing, Will, Personality, or Fatherhood of Heaven. Individuality and Communion, or our Self and our Conditions, are the two great complementary or compensating Facts which produce our Being:—The living Centre and the living Surface of our Sphere; always floating in the circumambient Vast ; and whose Hoiizon, in proportion to our own powers and insight, enlarges itself to that Living Infinity—that Resistless Firmament, which we name by turns, and it deserves all the infinity of such-like names, the Life, Love, Will, Law, Order, Destiny or Fate—the Omnipresent Deity. Our Liberty, therefore, like our powers, is a restricted one—restricted, not by any definite limits; marked, assigned, or assignable—but by the constant</page><page sequence="19">r it pressure and reaction of the rest. And as we become conscious of our powers, we become conscious also of this elastic medium ; which by no means weakens, on the whole, either our liberty or power; but, even while com¬ pressing, solidifies, preserves, and centres them, and adds its own returning force and momentum to their recoil. And, consciously or unconsciously, every Force, or resultant of force, always has, and always takes, " its Choice :" —either, rests, so far as it can rest; or, as it moves, moves always in the direction of the " greatest impulsion," the " greatest attraction," or the " least resistance ;" three expressive names, obviously, for the same Com¬ bination. But is not the Will free in some higher sense The Will is free in the highest sense, for it is the highest power; nay, it is twice free; for it is a reflective force—the resultant and deliberate determination of all the powers; and is not only free, but knows their freedom and its own; and its own power of choice, and responsibility and duty of choosing right; quite as well as it knows any of the powers or their determinant motives, or its own ; generally indeed a great deal better. And the Will, like any of the powers, especially the mental ones, is quite free, and quite apt, to fritter all its own powers away ; and then, with its powers, both its liberty and itself evaporate. But, even when strongest and best balanced, it is equally, and still more consciously, restricted by the circumambient Will; and free either to acquiesce in that Restriction—with Wisdom, Courage, Resignation, Trust—or to harm itself and others, by perverse Wilfulness and Folly. And is the Divine Will no more free than this No more:—Unlimited in power, God is equally unlimited in Liberty and Will; except by One thing : the all-searching and Inevitable—God. He is the One Being who can never deny, desert, forget, or ever act, think, feel, below—Himself. And on this rests the Stability not only of the Universe, or Universes, but also of the Goodness, Morality, Religion, which underlie them all; and which animate and mould them all, according to His Will and Character, into the ever- ascending Expression of the Unchangeable. ' Liberty, then, may be defined, the Concordance of Self with the other Selves, or of the Individual with his Sphere; and Choice or Will is the resultant determination of the motives: the direction which the powers, consciously or luiconsciouhly, "-will" take. If these be instinctive, and undisturbed by doubts, we call them physical or Natural; if reflective, Moral; if religious, or with a sense of the Divine, the Liberty of Christ. And Necessity is the converse of all these: the Inevitable Action of the Whole upon the Individual: —which is, therefore, neither dead nor blind ; but just as Living, Loving, Elastic, Careful, Discriminating, as the Deity. Thus Nothing is really Isolated : there is no Sole but Whole; no Alone but All and One: no real Independence or Self-Dependence except for Him ; and whatever of these attributes He imparts to Any must be conditioned by, and concordant with, this Essential Fatherhood. And What is Law Only another Name for that Universal Relationship ; —and, though a convenient and popular, rather a shallow and superficial name; derived from our best idea of such " laws" as we can formulate, and</page><page sequence="20">18 which seldom descend to any depth. Human or Mundane Laws—whether so-called Natural, Social, Scientific, Moral, or Religious—are only at best very- partial Tentatives—and very often most pretentious, sorry, deceptive, and mistaken tentatives—to discern and state those aspects, lines, or sections of the Universal Relationship which most affect ourselves ; and Which—like a " diamond net," as it has been prettily called, of infinite minuteness and elasticity, through whose pervading meshes all must pass—underlies and inter¬ penetrates all Substance, and all Force; and shapes, forms, re-forms them " as He Will." " The Spirit of the Law" names something vastly Higher, and is an Insight of the Living Law ;—altogether identical, too, with the Spirit of Liberty ; and of Educated Will—as we have gradually learned to conform our wills to His, and pray, in all simplicity, Thy Kingdom Come; Thy Will be Done on Earth, as it is in Heaven. Of course, the Spirit of the Law always commands all Forms of Law, or forms of anything, even the most Divine :— as our Lord, for instance, out-commands even that most commanding and comprehensive Scheme of Law, the Decalogue ; or as St. Paul resolves it all into the higher principle of Love. In general, it "transcends," or "goes beyond," all forms ; and makes any Law not Formal or Literal, but Moral or Reflective—lets us see its spirit, motive, purpose : and then binds us by the motive, out far beyond what any form or letter could embrace, much less define. Our Righteousness must exceed that of any Scribes or Pharisees. It is this Spirit of Law, personally felt, that makes each man " a law unto himself;" and commands, and enables, him to guide himself, "in accordance with his Sphere," i.e., ultimately with the Will Supreme. He whose Will accords with His is always in " perfect liberty;" as anyone always is, and feels himself, unrestricted so far as his will and circumstances coincide. Natural Laws all Nature obeys instinctively. In fact, they are impressed on its Elements, with their genesis and growth ; in sustained habits or habitudes, modes of repeated and educated action ; each Act making its own repe¬ tition easier, by pointing the forces in its own direction. Social Laws, whether called Religious or not, are obeyed from analogous motives; but more tentatively, more consciously, and more obviously in an education- process—as Society leams its way upwards, and builds or Constitutes itself after the best Ideal it discerns. All are always commanded by the Spirit of the Law; which none may violate. Any Sin against any Law, or Form of law, or Form of any thing, however Good, may and " shall be forgiven unto men;" but sin against the Spirit of Law is Sin against The Spirit of Purity and Good, and is essentially unforgiveable. It must be thoroughly " purified away ;''—And this Necessity is as Eternal as Purity Itself. Article 11. HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT, AND CHANGELESS DESTINY. We have glanced at one line of History, that of our Material Universe :— a very complex and extended line, but only One ; and one passing through a Firmament of such Infinite Capacity : that if there be not others, and many others, there is at least much Room to spare:—Space, Time, Power, Sym-</page><page sequence="21">19 pathy, Fatherhood, must be going to loss; or else The Divine is either smaller, or more otiose and indifferent than we suppose. The Easterns say that "a day and night of Brahma" means a Whole Material Universe, with its History and Destiny complete; that a " life of Brahma," supposed Eternal, means the whole Succession of such Universes, through The Eternity of eternities; that Brahma has an infinity of such Lives, each with its own Embodiment; that all these lives are infinitely Diverse, and unlike each other in every Character; and that, finally, Brahma is not The Ultimate Deity, but only His Self-Expression or Essential Son. This is, at least, a resolute attempt to "abhor a vacuum," and utilize the Firmament. And Thought will easily convince itself that all such concep¬ tions ; or even the childish efforts of mythology and angelography, old and new; are far from groundless; that they are truly "feeling after" a most Substantial or Necessary Truth ; which they partly see; and are only drawing on Imagination for details. There may be, possibly or probably are, as many lines of Invisible, but most real, History, for ever crossing the Firmament; harmonizing with, or helping, each other; and occupying it; as there are certainly, at any time, lines of invisible but most real light, traversing the luminiferous ether; in every direction, from every star; and actually influential in every vibration of every particle. There is little of Vacuum, as we are gradually finding out, in the lower regions of power and substance; Why should we suppose it in the Upper And How Empty should the Divine Fulness be But we pass to another question. All these lines of History or Develop¬ ment : Do they not add something to the Infinite Do they not develope, and therefore alter,—Deity itself Not in the least:—Tbey do not even add to the totality of things ; any more than the waves and currents in the ocean add to the ocean, or those in the atmosphere to it. They do show the Unity to be Tri-Unity ; and make things cognizant of Son and Spirit, both deve¬ loped, and always developing, ad infinitum; and they do develop Constitution into Course, and create and alter every part of it—It is a living Constitution. But they neither lessen or increase the Sum ; change the Constitution; or modify its Character. From, or out of, The Infinite All are developed; and To the Infinite All are Always present—known, balanced, judged, and recon¬ ciled. Explicit History is but Implicit Destiny, as seen and felt in parts. It is always Kismet; and is seen to be Kismet, as the Dico becomes the Dictum, or the Fatum, and the Fiat Fact :—Each being always the Explicit and Implicit Deity in One. But is not this brow-beating the Intellect, or imposing on it—Words Not at all:—The subject, from its nature, transcends all finite faculties; but only in the sense of going beyond them, while inviting and helping them to follow; and thus drawing them out into its own commimion. These common words record what men have always felt, expressed, and considered " rational," or " proportioned to their faculties;" else common language had never enter¬ tained them. And the conception itself, however travestied by quasi- philosophy and quasi-theology, is about the most familiar and necessary we have. " Activity out-embraced by underlying rest;" or "succession more-</page><page sequence="22">20 than-contained in a sum-total"—What else are we what else is anything or how could any Act proceed on any other Basis Even this Searching Omnipresence is no more a Mystery to us than any other of life's miracles. We are ourselves a small image of such " ubiquity" in space, time, sym¬ pathy, and every faculty we use ; a ubiquity that enlarges and emphasizes itself with every increase of our powers. Our Here denominates a simul¬ taneous presence over a certain extent of Space ; to which each sense adds all that that sense commands. Our Now is a contemporaneous grasp of Time, to which memory, foresight, insight, add indefinitely. Our Mind and Sympathies: How many things and persons do they embrace at once, and involved with far-reaching interests Nay, how much even of The Unknown itself comes home to us in fear, faith, hope, wonder, joy—over-filling the emotions or affections; which make us, habitually, one with each other ; in supreme moments, almost intelligently, " one with Christ and God?" One- in-many, and many-in-one, is not only the basis of our common life, but about the most vivid element of consciousness. Article 12. INSPIRATION, REVELATION, ASPIRATION, PRAYER. Our Orb being (see Art. 8) but one of the sister spangles of that lurninous sheet, or " Veil," which divides the Living Firmament into the lower and the Upper Heavens ; and being, like the rest, in a progressive or transition state; in most intimate Communion, demonstrably, with the inorganic world below itself, from which, it seems, it is derived; and, if not demonstrably, quite as convincingly, with the Spiritual or Organic Realms Above ; towards which all its highest profoundly aspire, and by which they are increasingly " attracted :"—next to glancing at the steps or stages of the Process, our still nearer interest is with its Machineries. These are All, we saw, imparted and administered, in great and small, ordinary and extraordinary, by The Same Spirit; distributing, variously, " as He will;" but always inviting, seeking, and in fine obliging, the Co-operation of " the creature;" for, in fact, it is by such co-operation that the creature is created. All His Influences or Opera¬ tion on us, from without, are justly called " Inspiration," or Incitement; when moving, speaking, struggling, from within, " Aspiration." The resul¬ tant or product of the first is justly called, in material things, " Embodi¬ ment;" in semi-material, "Word;" and in either or both, with a distinct religious reference, "Revelation." Aspiration, if carelessly or offensively directed, is commonly called Ambition; if humbly and entreatingly, and especially if religiously, we all call it " Prayer." [We call Word " semi-material," for want of a better term. Light and Heat are propagated alike through the substance of the ether, which seems equally to pervade all space, whether also occupied by matter or not. And so far, both in rest and action, they are strictly immaterial, invisible, insen¬ sible, and only known to Science. But when they impinge on matter, they combine with, and alter it; and, thus embodied, become sensible themselves; furnishing the light, heat, colour, and in part the chemical composition, of common language. Sound, however, is essentially different. It is the</page><page sequence="23">21 undulations, not of the immaterial ether, but of the material masses, molecules, or particles themselves ; and, so far, strictly material. It never, however, except for the moment, embodies itself in matter; whether by phonograph, or roll, or shock; but simply passes through it, and passes on —exercising, however, as it goes, a formative, or arranging influence, and thus leaving behind it permanent effects ; if repeated, the analogue of habits. It is strikingly the type, therefore, or Archetype, of this present Transition- Stage of Being; and " the Word"—adding, to Sound or Music, the farther connotation of Meaning and Connected Order—whencesoever derived, and whatever its signification at the time, is a profoundly scientific contribution to the Names of Christ. Of course, all written or printed Words belong essentially to " forms;" or to material forms; and even in their highest sense, not to Inspiration, but to Revelation. Through such, always, the Spirit, and its Meaning, passes, forming, and re-forming, as it goes.] All earnest Aspiration, therefore, or upward-set Ambition, all " hungering and thirsting after" knowledge, righteousness, true holiness, or any real Elevation, is of God's Spirit; and in proportion to its sense of want, and sustained and well-directed effort to attain, must tend to verify itself; and prove, moreover, the determining cause, and main engine, of its own fulfil¬ ment. All who so ask receive; who so seek find ; to every such knocker it shall be opened. But when all this is called, as it is most justly, by the name of Prayer, some Cautions must be added. (a) The lips and knees are the very smallest of the faculties which pray. Let neither Pagan nor Christian expect to be heard " for their much speak¬ ing," either in public or private. Even the sickly Poet can instruct us— " He Prayeth best who Loveth best, all things both great and small." The more manly Monk can chaunt, " He Prayeth best who Worketh best: with hands, ami head, and heart." And even the Skeptic [in things conventional] has faith to cry, " Help yourself, and Heaven will help you ;" or even, " Put your shoulder to the wheel; and—I'll give you a lift myself." (6) Any definite result of prayer will, of course, mainly depend on its faith or insight; i.e., how far it accords with "the mind of the Spirit," or the circumambient Will. Most justly, therefore, do we pray the Spirit to teach us What and How to ask; and even the intensest entreaties of the Christ are conditioned by "not My Will, but Thine be done." Generally, however, the large or Whole result will be analogous to the definite petition, and will frequently include it. A cripple begs " an alms ;" an upper Minister replies with—not silver and gold, but " Arise and walk." Eye-sight, or a daughter's life, is entreated; the Christ can not only give them both, but add, " Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace." " The King asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest him a long life, even for ever and ever." (c) Obviously, its efficacy will be greatest in communion: when we ask for one another, or for the great objects Christians have at heart. The diffused Wish not only produces, but largely is its own effect; and it turns to marvellous, often to unexpected or inexplicable, efficiency, even the acci¬ dents or obstacles that seem to bar its way. Pray we then, Hallowed be Thy Name: Thy Kingdom come: Thy Will be done: Enable us to Help.</page><page sequence="24">22 (d) The physical Explanation of its Efficaoy—like that of any of the higher powers, often loose y callel " the supernatural"—is as yet beyond our Science: farther than that we know even the humblest organic powers to be, or to involve, immense concentrations of lower energy-; so that their Equiva¬ lents, in lower Chemistry, or Heat, or Mechanism, must be vast, almost incredible. Probably even the scanty vegetation on a mountain's side, if its powers were thus degraded and exploded, wovld not only shiver the whole range to atoms, but shoot their elements about, in fine gas-jets, comparable to those which play around the Sun Or, probably, the powers at any time concentrated in each Orb, and chiefly on its surface, if similarly driven backwards, would melt back the Orb itself into Immaterial Ether. Happily, man has no such knowledge of his own powers, or their modes of application, as enables either caprice or benevolence to experiment in this direction; but it is quite supposable that even a slight addition to our insight and sagacity might easily produce results most startling and unheard. At present, our interests, our affections, and our ambit.ons, all alike impel us upward; in which direction it requires large, sustained, and concentrated efforts to attain a slight result, or even, in the " struggle for more-than-existence," to retain our place. And any violation of the Natural Order is disastrous:—Light itself, if too soon, or too strong, is a most destructive force; and a premature Gospel will disorganise and demoralize any Society we know. Article 13. ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THINGS : THEIR mDIVIDUALITY, COMMUNION, GRADATION, ANALOGY. By this constant Co-operation of the Spirit from Above, with the Manifes¬ tation, working upwards, Creation builds itself, in ascending grades, and makes its true character and Constitution increasingly Explicit in Nature, Provi¬ dence, and Grace:—the successive steps or stages of the growth recording themselves in the advancing strata, orders. Kingdoms of the Constitution. So that the Structure is in the form of a Mount or Pyramid ; with broad, humble essential base in the unseen ; whereon her great Periods, the days and nights of Astronomic or Geologic Genesis deposit each its higher Product; in some¬ what-parallel layers or Rings, static and dynamic; each acting as at once sustainment and incentive to the next; into which, while still unseen, its own elements aspire. And, both in Lower and in Upper Genesis, each grade performs, even unconsciously, its own functions for the whole. In Social Structure, for example, the higher cultivate, andmust diffuse the higher ambitions, qualities, and tastes. The sturdy middle brotherhoods do the week-day work ; and though the strongest are not always the best and wisest, it is always their interest to become so, and their own ambitions and affections preach the same. While the humbler grades are always the most fundamental and essential; and on them All depends—even for existence. To remove or sink the upper were to demoralize, decivilize, dereligionize society, and force it back some steps to chaos. To remove the lowest, would either at once</page><page sequence="25">28 destroy the whole, or must bring down all the grades, by more than one step, and make all the work more painful and uncertain. To reduce all to strictly one level—which must be the lowest; as it cannot be levelled up or raised above the mother-earth—were positively to restore the social chaos; and then One Season must finish the Society; for preservation of Any thing were impossible, even of food itself. Thus all Existence is really Operation, all Co-existence, Co-operation; all Action essentially Interaction ; and Constitution itself depends on the two Co-essential principles -Individuality and Communion-which really produce each Thing. Both are affirmed in the I AM; and in both do all God's creatures share. From Communion does each come ; by Communion is each developed, with all his qualities, characters, and attributes; and in Com¬ munion only does any of these exist. Remove the ochers, and each character or quality vanishes of itself, as distinctly as Gravity, i.e. mutual attraction ; or as the very idea of Force, Action, or Relation. And Individuality is just as essential; without it indeed there could be no Communion. And it belongs not only to each Thing, but to each molecule or atom of each thing. Each of these has its own identity and distinctive characters, depending on its place and genesis, which cannot be destroyed. But they can be, and are, all, subordinated in construction; so that every individual within our cognizance is a complex or constituted individual; and Constitution is co-extensive with Things themselves. Our minutest Point, for instance, the ether-atom, must be about as complex as our Orb or Solar System, or it could not discharge its functions:—in every moment, and apparently in every vibration, propagating Light, in every direction, of every colour, kind and character, and of every intensity, from Sunlight down to the inappreciable ; while doing the same for Heat also, and other cognate forces. We may, perhaps, fancy it a sphere, compressible into a variable ellipsoid, and composed of an infinity of polar or magnetic points; each of which, again, may be similarly constituted, and so on ad infinitum; while, on the other side, our own Orbs may be but the larger points of a Starry Sphere ; fulfilling analogous functions for the Vasts above. And, like our Orbs, each ether-atom must have its own space and time relations, and doubtless others too, depending on its history and place; and positively influential in the magnitude, direction, characters, of every vibration, as well as in its general habitudes and capacities. Nothing, therefore, could be more helplessly untrue than the Idealist dreams of Fixity, Uniformity, Immobility ; of Absolute Atoms really Indivi¬ sible, Equal, Independent, Immutable; or of any Essential and Eternal Forms, surd or intellectual—whether called ideas, gods, goddities, or neces¬ sities ; and its conception of such a " reign of ends" must approach very near the climax of self-contradiction and absurdity ; even without asking How could there be a " reign" without subjects, or any " act" without force, motive, or material? Nay, a'l Form is in transitu, &amp;* well as all Sub¬ stance and all Force ; the Universal Relationship guiding their mutual influence and constant interaction. But each element shares the Individu¬ ality—often mistaken for identity—of the Divine ; and the minutest of real</page><page sequence="26">24 things, if we will open our eyes to see, is also, while profoundly consistent with itself and with all reality, vastly more marvellous and high than all these self-contradictions labour to imagine. The analogy of the Individual to the Social Body, and to the Whole, is frequently insisted on, and is far more essential and pervading than is sup¬ posed. In fact, every individual, whether a person or not, is a microcosm, miniature, or working-model of the Macrocosm up to his own level; and "images" compendiously both the constitution and course of things from his own highest downwards. Any Metal, for instance, solid or gasiform, repre¬ sents and exemplifies, in its character and history, the whole process and attainment of nature up to the level of that metal; every plant, up to the rank of that plant; every Man, to the place of that man; and each, if traced back, would exhibit all the preceding stages in their essential character and order:—the earlier stages, however, being vastly compressed in time, from nature's being able to use her already trained, educated, concentrated materiel. And, what is still more startling, each Act of Nutrition, perhaps every typical act, repeats the process and results, still more compendiously, anew, from the beginning. So that not only all Creation's Works-and-Days, however widely extended in Course, with its vast steps and intervals, are, in Constitution, actually present, in their essential energies, characters, and order; Co¬ operating in the production of each immediate Future ; but every individual Thing, besides, so far as it is true and typical, up to its own level, exhibits and exemplifies All the History in brief. Thus Man was created from the Dust of the Earth ; that dust, from its Crust; that crust, from gaseous Elements; and these, say, from Imma¬ terial Ether; in each stride, doubtless, through natural and appointed in¬ termediates. And every man is now created in precisely the same manner : only that his earlier stages, before his birth or his conception, instead of requiring vast geologic and astronomic periods, take place in a few months ; from Nature's using High Materiel ; into which all these vast periods in their order, with all their energies, efforts, attainments, and trained and educated habits, have been compressed and concentrated. And Each man exhibits and exemplifies all this, up to his own level, both of natural and spiritual creation; in a distinct individual line from the beginning; which line, again, is or was composed of points into which converged and crossed an infinity of just such lines ; and all as influential on that point as are the lines of lower influence upon each ether-atom. And then, in every typical act, the man repeats the process more compendiously:—in his Nutrition, for example, down all the lines which have produced his food, and are now influential in its transubstantia- tion;—in his Breathing, where even sensibly his mundane meet with heavenly elements, and the blood is inspired and purified;—even in the noonday Walk, where heaven's light and heat combine directly with his sub¬ stance, renewing health and strength. These in natural creation; and quite as obviously in the spiritual, as all his Experience tells upon each act and effort, and enables him to make, or at least to strive to make, each supper a Supper of the Lord ; each inspiration, the breathing of a Higher atmosphere; or even the noonday or nightly walk some fresh Intercourse with God.</page><page sequence="27">25 All Things ARE about us, in this searching Relationship, and create and constitute at once our Self and our Communion. It is this frequent more-than-parallellism—(1) between the strata or grades of men and things: touching frequently, meeting at least in the unseen; (2) of the individual with the whole; or any section of it, if cut from top to bottom ; and (3) of the gradation and action of the vital forces that animate them all—that gives its depth and many-sidedness to common lan¬ guage, common feeling, common sense :—What the passion of any one, the fine frenzy of the poet, or the earnest insight of the Prophet or Apostle will develop at any time ; and may pause to picture in proverb, parable or psalm ; each inviting a multitude of most just and searching applications. On the same depends, more superficially, the value and suggestive power of Poetry, Eloquence, Art; and all the freshness, richness, wit, humour, and unex- pelled pathos of Common Conversation:—What Society delights in, and Science abhors and eschews, as disturbance and dissipation. That is, each Science in its own department:—for the very object of each science is to isolate one side or aspect of things, for special study in severe detail, excluding all things else. But when the Sciences compare their notes and would correlate ; the isolation disappears; the combined complexity and symmetry of finites and infinites overgrows and amazes the Conception; and all definite results are summed up in the great word Analogy—a deep and true—on the side of Science far the truest—Principle, for the Analysis, Interpretation, Exposition of Things. It may remind us here of one Caution frequently overlooked ; that we must bear in mind not only the Kind and Order of our Proportions, but the Direction also of Each Series :—else we shall find ourselves making, quasi- scientifically, most grotesque mistakes. Our more-than-parallels will have become in whole or part, less-than-parallels ; and we shall be combining our partial cones top-side-t'other-way; or attempting to build or balance them, not on their base but on their steeple. Our common illustration is so-called Irish Humour, with its plausible inversions, and well-meant mistakes. But more serious and imposing examples are abundant everywhere; and we are almost forced to notice two. (1) Quasi-Theology among us will insist on building Religion upon— Authority indeed, but the authority of—a Book-Revelation; This, again, upon the authority, not of its intrinsic power, worth, impressiveness; hut of External Evidence—supposed somewhere discernible in remote antiquity; This, in turn, on the authority of [external] Miracle—supposed somewhere [externally] attested and recorded in that antiquity. The Miracle itself being some supposed [external] " suspension" of " gravity," or other " law of Nature"—not a marvellous Sign or witness of God's Presence, broad, deep, pervading, beneficent, and, except to thought or Insight, insen¬ sible—but some " singular point," the more isolated, external, and unresolv- able; and the more pointed, extreme, and pinnacle-high, the better ;—such marvel being the most " evidently" wrought by some Deity the most " exter¬ nal and otherwise unknown" to Nature, Providence, and Grace. Then as a Corollary or Compensation for such extremely distant or invisible " Evi-</page><page sequence="28">26 dence;" this [inverted] Authority must be scrutinized, weighed, and found convincing by the " private judgment" of every Individual; even of the children, and the rural and city poor ;—Else their Religion is " only natural, traditional, and derived from parentage : the same as that of Catholics, or even Pagans ;" whom Enlightenment now discerns to have been "formally and properly" " Atheists; because they worshipped [not God, but] Gods; who [whether Dii, Domini, or Elohini] are scientifically and philo¬ sophically Nothing." And How, oh, Enlightened Gentlemen, shall the industrial poor of Ire¬ land reach this lofty, external Gospel, each for himself, through this long, recondite course of study? Oh, we'll give them all, and by compulsion, if requisite, Education Not those Old Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Mathematics, or other Foreign Dry-as-Dusts, to which they were so absurdly accus¬ tomed and attached—but English, Primmery, Plain, and Practical. We'll force them all to learn to—Read Tand the Three R's generally ; nothing else; though much is still pretended—and not even to read that Old, Fusty, too-Exciting Bible, in either Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or Englishl]. Well, and Then Oh, Then, they can all read our Christian Evidences, and other Enlightened Books! The Inversions of Authority, of Evidence, of Revelation, Religion, Miracle, and God—as well as of Christian Benevo¬ lence, and Common Sense, and of the very idea of Education Itself—being quite nearly parallel. And the Practical Results, not only on the Surface, but below it, being quite concordant with its Principles ;—After two genera¬ tions, the Empire is astonished to find that Middle-Class Irish Education is annihilated; and the Registrar-General reports that not one half of the whole population, not one-third of the classes operated on, can make a decent attempt to read! They all did learn ; in infancy; and have forgotten it! the natural next steps being forbidden or withdrawn. The Inspectors know, besides, that there is not so much as a School Library, of even English books, in any National School; that not many even of the teachers have read, still fewer read, any common English book; and that even the Saturday Instruction, for Scriptural or other Religious Teaching, has almost disappeared. Nay, Miracles, surely, should be " signs" not of God's Absence, but of His Presence; not There and Then, but Here and Now; Revelation, Manifes- tion, Light, should be, themselves, revealed, manifest, visible; else none will find them; any more than lamp or telescope will discover an Extin¬ guished Sun. Evidence should be evident; and Authority should speak as one having Authority, and not as the scribes; if by Delegation, its Patent should be patent; if by Its Own—then let it speak, if it can, the Words of God direct: Insight to insight, Heart to heart, Spirit to spirit—as the Bible always does—and those who have ears to hear will hear. Education should be a Jacob's Ladder to the skies; It ceases to be Education, and becomes a pretence and stumbling-trap, when, by way of making it level to the people, both its ends are laid upon the earth. Religion, like every other gift of God, comes to us at first always on Natural Authority—but then it must vindicate itself in its results—by the fruits it bears—else it must quickly</page><page sequence="29">27 die, and its encumbrance be removed at any cost. Besides, St. Paul does not say that any " gods" are nothing ; but that, " though gods many, or lords many," or angels, principalities, or powers, yet to lis, who know their place and function, there is but One—Lord of lords, King of lings, GOD of All the Gods, and of all their worshippers, whether they know it so or not. But he does say that " their idols are nothing in the world;" and he would say the same of any " forms" whatever, whether called [GkJ Eidea, Eidola, or Ideai; and whether Pagan, Jewish, or Christian. With him Circumcision is nothing ; and Uncircumcision nothing ; Heart-Affection and True-Obedience to the Spirit of God and Good, are the real " substances" with him. (2) Quasi-Economic-Science growing downwards, and striking banyan- roots below, attains the like sublime idea of Society viewed from beneath; and insists on realizing the quasi-theologic Communism. That is, tenta¬ tively, and so far as possible; for there is a huge dead-weight of tradition, property, prestige, educated habits, trained aspirations, and consolidated authority, to be overcome—to say nothing of the strangely mistaken dictates of Religion, Revelation, and the Church ; which have never trusted " Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," or the other Talismanic Ideas, or Misread Statistics, of the Philosophic Demos;—But persist in building on old-fashioned prin¬ ciples, seriously diverse from those of the IUumination. Every good man will deeply sympathize in the real objects sought by these waves of Upper and Lower Communism:—the practical elevation of the masses; and by the noble gospel of well-paid industry, manly thought, aspiring purpose, mutual respect, and brotheily affection. Who does not burn to help them? But these things must all grow. They cannot be improvised or borrowed, like bank notes or ideas. And all Great things take long time to grow; and grow only in appointed Order. Even when the fulness of its time has come, Every Real Gospel supposes Law, and built-up Institutions; and requires good ground, and patient, careful tillage ; Else even the best of Seed is woise than lost; " the wine ib spilled, and the bottles perish." The How, When, Why of all these Lofty Matters is a pregnant question—which we must defer to our " Social Principles." Meantime, we preach Caution, Inquiry, and Confidence in God. Even these popular attempts to attain great ends by a hasty rush are signs of the times; and not unhopeful. All Nature's Action is by Waves; sometimes accumulated into huge, tempestuous, overwhelming, Tides; which yet do lift things; especially lower, effete, and crumbling things; roll all together: and spread out the debris, at least, on a higher level. But Who wishes to see Floods again, Physical, Social, or Religious Let those, then, who do not sympathize in such aims; but are willing to neglect, depress, and tyran¬ nize ; in order to keep themselves at ease ; and pi event the poor becoming numerous, strong, or skilful; Beware, and be wise in time ; Let them remem¬ ber Moses and Pharaoh, and Many Another, in many a History, " raised up for our Ensamples;" and only too easily reproduced.</page><page sequence="30">28 Article 14 A. THE CHURCH: ITS HISTORY; PRE-CHRISTIAN OR NATIONAL. The Church is the Social Engine of the Holy Ghost—God's Witness and Apostle in Society : the Light of the World: the City set upon a Hill—and is simply Society itself, in its religious aspect: as animated, and gradually learning that it is animated, by the Life of God. Of course, therefore, its Base is the Family, both in History and Constitution. For the larger half of the Old Testament dispensations, it was merely a family-institute; pre¬ sently enlarging itself, with the Family, into the Tribe and Nation. And by its efficiency in maintaining, elevating, re-inspiring the Family, must it always be appraised. Its function is the development of the Individual; which can only be done by Communion. Knowledge, Righteousness, Holiness—each, successively, acts first from without; in response, arises a direct development from within; which expands till it meets the Iufinite; Thence, it returns again, reflec¬ tively, and becomes Self-Knowledge, Self-Command, Self-Consecration, or Self-Sacrifice—not for nothing, but—for all God's Family, or that part of it which we can help. Always, too, the separate elements not only grow on together, but multiply their effect into each other, and are more than cumulative. Knowledge, without righteousness, could never advance to Thought, or Wisdom; Righteousness, or law, without the higher spirit, could never reach the Loving, or the Good; and Holiness itself, denuded of the living inspiration of simple Insight and diffused Affections, would harden into the higher bondage of dead men's bones and the whited sepulchre. And so runs the History. Adam and Eve start in a Sabbath period ; with high endowments, and an elementary knowledge of self and God. The Knowledge grows, but neither preserves their Innocence, and Primal Home; nor prevents the young power and passions of the race from developing into such violence and corruption as sweep the race away. Through this dark Baptism, a righteous remnant hardly passes, and begins anew; under a Hope illumined Covenant of mutual respect and self-respect, and the Sacred- ness of the human Form and Life, as the Image of his Maker. Things now go better; but not without heavy falls and chastisements, both within and around the Family; till it grows into the Nation; and finds itself, after an¬ other Exodus and Baptism, under Written Law and a Religious Constitution ; Consecrated, and farther consecrating a selected tribe and family, and time and place, for Special religious services. Under this Constitution, they attain their historic, moral, and religious Eminence; largely teach, and much impress, the nations, as Jehovah's Witness; and finally, having produced their Scriptures, Old and New, and recorded therein their costly Experience and highest Inspirations—as their " last will and testament to man"—they sacrifice again, with Gentile help and by Gentile hands, themselves, and all they have and are:—First, their long-sought Prophet, Priest, and King; next, their Nation, City, Temple, with all its Law and Ordinance—and their national Prestige, and Calling, and Messiahship. And now, no longer a Nation, but an exile and outcast, it</page><page sequence="31">29 wanders on, in weary, half-repentant pilgrimage; not only " consecrated," but " devoted" or " accursed;" repudiated, rejected, in human sight degraded, and " thrust without the gate"—or, it may be, its scarce-embodied Spirit, in some amazed or penitential Purgatory, wanders wistfully around the farther Mission of its Promise—while Another has taken its Office; and, having made itself, in the deepest sense, Partaker of Its Sacrifice and Self-Sacrifice, now, consciously or unconsciously, repeats its Experience on a larger scale. Article 14 B. THE CHURCH: ITS HISTORY; CHRISTIAN OR CATHOLIC. Initial Christianity was but consummated Judaism—Rachel bears her Son and blesses him, and dies. Through that cruel Baptism and dark Passover, the Youth presently appears in the larger world; bearing Her Name and Promise; shall we add Her Cross also ?—upon His shoulder. At the moment when Israel's Religion had reached its climax, the Roman Arms and the Greek Intelligence had equally attained theirs. The First had just conquered East and West, and, with a proud humility, rendered itself captive to the Second; now dominant or tyrannical in letters; and especially, or overwhelmingly, influential in the East. Even the New Testament was mostly written in Greek; into which the Old also had long been translated. And to this Great Mind and Culture the dying Israel commended at once his Scriptures, his Spirit, and his Son. Its Conversion, then, was the first great Effort, and great Triumph, of the Church. The first development of Gentile Christianity was Asiatic-Greek; beginning from Antioch; centering, dubiously and dividedly, in Hellenic guise, at Ephesus, Corinth, Alexandria, Byzantium; combining with, com¬ manding, and largely modifying, the Hellenic Empire over Mind. But was it really converted Well; yes ; so far as it had elements to receive or to retain. But its field was now a beaten thoroughfare, bespread with rock and thorns ; and the Great Message had to travel farther West, to find, in time, a deeper and more virgin soil. It was baptized; it loudly professed, and did its best to learn and preach the Gospel. But the bottles were too old. Inquisitive, brilliant, and ambitious to excel; but vain, rhetorical, contentious, and, in an extreme degree, seditious and self-seeking; the Greeks always found it easier to talk about Religion than digest it; and they now retained much more the vices of their worn-out Demos; than either its earlier virtues, or their own. Besides, its Philosophy—which was never Wisdom, but an ostentatious flirtation with it—had now sublimed itself into the Platonic or Academic form ; professedly skeptic; really dualist, antithetic, negative, and nihilistic. It identified Truth with Fixity; rejected, therefore, change or Growth; with it, virtually, embodiment and Life ; especially the family fife and natural affections; and set its heart on a political, it can hardly be called social, Idea altogether Utopian, unnatural, and absurd. Even wives and children should be common; poetry, affection, feeling should he excluded; and identity and</page><page sequence="32">80 uniformity made the test both of Truth and of Reality. The intensest struggles of the Early Church were with this Essential Antichrist, in various forms of Gnosticism. These it vanquished ; but not without serious mutila¬ tions, and some compromises, which, even when verbal, seriously mislea 1 ; and, co-operating with repeated invasions from the East, still prove our main doctrinal difficulties; and only compensate themselves by the mental conflict and activities evolved. While Eastern Christianity was thus evaporating in disputes and show ; a graver form was striking its root-fibres in the West; and gradually center¬ ing itself at Rome. Accepting the dominant doctrines from the East; and chivalrously enforcing them at every sacrifice; but, with a true instinct, turning to heart-work; regenerating life and manners; purifying the family ; reorganizing the effete Society; all in the name of Christ; and, when all went down before the rude barbarians, beginning again upon a clearer field. With whatever weapjns came to hand; but chiefly by armies of living martyrs, men and women; and by the resistless power of self-devotion and self sacrifice; it fought and won and worked, and built up Medieval Chris¬ tendom. And then, in turn, when Pro-perity had blessed it; and it had prostrated all other tyrannies; all too naturally, it tyrannized itself; and rendered needtul new convulsions; just as Providence had opened a new world, or new worlds, athirst for the result. Latin Christianity, therefore, was a war, not for knowledge, but for righteousness ; and a righteousness fighting always beneath the banner of a high self-consecration; which, even while outward, was piofoundly believed in and sincere. Its whole work was a true Crusade; and it conquered most where it least supposed. And, obviously, this second dispensation of the Christian Church followed, though on a higher as well as larger scale, the ways and methods of the middle Jewish ; but instinctively and originally ; not as a conscious imitator, but a living Son ; with feelings and principles, however derived, now innate and its own. What our Third Dispensation will effect, remains unseen. It occupies, at least, a strikingly analogous position to the Final stage of Israel's, the Initial of our own. With just the like of Samaria and Galilee, and Greece and Rome, and Syrophenicia and Egypt, surrounding - and, with just such mingled feelings of reverence and resentment, acting on—the traditional Judea and Jerusalem; with mi-sionary synagogues influential everywhere; and vast expectation and inquiry, and many a Baptist and Christ announcing new Messiahs. There is much Profession too, and sincerely-meant profes¬ sion, of Holmess itself. But What Holiness is, in essence, " True ?" Assuredly none which is is not "Spiritual" or " All-pervading"—none that can rest content with any Sacredness, in its own nature, special, distinctive, or professional - however needful such may have been, or be—in order to reach and teach the conception itself—separating a part for Gol, but not leaving the rest profane. Must again a vision teach the Prime Apostle that "what God has cleansed, even he must not deem common?" A deeper Catholicity, without frittering or indifferentism, must out-embrace Catholicity itself. The Talisman of this is all-pervading, never-failing—Charity.</page><page sequence="33">31 It should be remembered that Original or Hebrew Christianity, "the Gospel of the Circumcision," was always bound to the Whole Jewish Law as such; and so continued till the destruction of Jerusalem—strove, indeed, to continue longer:—While Gentile Christianity was bound to none of it; but gradually built, and was obliged to build, its Institutions for itself. Having ascertained its liberty in the Council of Jerusalem, and accepted thence some needful key principles of morals—and even these not on the authority of Moses, but of the Council, in which itself was represented—it soon and earnestly adopted the Sacraments in their order, and around these com¬ menced its Work. Of course, it was always bound to the whole Spirit and Principles of the Jewish Law, and of every just law, and bound to better them if it COULD; and in this spirit, and with these aids, while abiding loyally by the institutions and observances in which each had been born, it steadily purified, refined, and re-inspired them all. And thus, at least on one great scale and segment of the world, She has made, and is making, " its kingdoms to become"—the more smoothly and insensibly the better—"the Kingdoms of God and of His Christ." Article 14 C. THE CHURCH, OR SOCIETY; ITS CONSTITUTION. Derived from the Family, and simply by the Expansion of its Middle Grade or Brotherhood, of course the fundamental principles remain un¬ changed, while its occupations become enlarged, diversified, distributed ; the common week-day work being done by the sturdy brotherhood; the wisdom, experience, and sometimes inspired direction, coming from the fatherhood above; the refinement, tenderness, hopes, and charities arising from the very Weakness of the Mother and the Babe. And these essential interests embody themselves in all the ways and institutions of Society. Its Scripture Analysis is into three functions, the Prophet, Priest, and King—co responding to the three successive elements just traced in its History. The Prophet represents foresight, insight, discernment, convictions ; and bears the same relation to the rest that light and vision do to our lower work ; inte'lect and knowledge to our higher; or that the reflective insight of Experience, with its remembered flashes of more vivid inspiration, do to the general interests of the Family. The corresponding Sentiments are impres¬ sions, emotions, impulses, intentions; as distinguished from rules, habits, practical principles of action, or even formed affections and habitual motives ; all which belong to the working Brotberhood, and come imder the department of the Priest. His office is to bring up the people to—or so near to as is possible or wise—the highest level discerned by the Prophet, or embodied in his Ideal pictures. While the King, in the Social, as in the Individual Constitution, represents the Conscience; the collective and fina1 judgment of the powers, deliberately comprehending All the elements ; and consciously sinning against itself by omitting or neglecting Any. And this is a just analysis. Every Society, as it forms, will evolve the three, and on their mutual action its progress will depend. The Prophet stands for the future; though probably he reads it from an insight of the past,</page><page sequence="34">82 where its principles are most easily observed. But, even when truest, he is apt to be too hasty and severe; and, by omitting or mistaking essential elements, which have not come within his cognizance, he may easily impose upon himself. The Priest's standard is the past; the best he has himself been taught; by whose habits, methods, and momentum, he would generally too much rule the present. He becomes plodding, slavish, and inflexible; and while aiming to go " straight-forward in a plain, practical line," really leaves the true Orbit at a tangent. The Third must Act for All; on the most comprehensive judgment he can form; In the Present; as at once embodying the Past, and determining the Future; and is thus our nearest " image'' of the Omnipresent; for every present includes always as much of past and future as it can bring to bear. His one sin is Partiality; the partial, or party, Magistrate so far discrowns himself. In Modern Society the First is mainly represented by the Press; much, by the Anonymous Press; and its chief temptation is to sell itself for bread or present popularity; whispering peace, peace ; and smoothing the coming breach with untempered mortar. The Second, by "institutions" and " asso¬ ciations ;" at first fresh and fit, but apt to harden into formalism and oppres¬ sion. The Third, by the cultivated Judgment of Society; too apt to divide itself into sections, castes, coteries, " worlds;" sure soon, especially if near the front, to totally misconceive their own position and influences, and to mistake the signs of the times. And then again, for the millionth time, " A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely; and the priests bear rule by their means ; and my people love to have it so; and what will ye do in the end thereof?" These are only impairing or narcotising influences. More obvious social derangement, danger, or disease arises from the undue preponderance of either of the Three. The King, too strong, oppresses everything ; too soon, is weak, partial, tyrannical of necessity, and obliges the disruption of his realm. The Prophet, too strong, unsettles, bewilders, and misleads ; as much as the Priest would benumb and stereotype. And a most insidious and fatal error is that which so speedily exhausted Greece :—that perversion of Brotherhood which would fain make itself the Whole, forgetting or excluding the other grades, and striving to constitute itself upon a single level. This is the principle of Democracy, as contrasted with that of Republic, Common¬ wealth, or State ; and of Doctrinaireship, or hasty Illumination, as compared with Wisdom. The Roman Populus included patres, plebes, familiares, patroni, clientes, &amp;c, as well as Socii, to whom it imparted freely both its Work and Offices. Modern States differ chiefly in the names and forms of their gradations, which they are sure to multiply. But the Demos would insist on being a rather large, but quite a level brotherhood—all above, below, around, being merely tyrants, chattels, enemies, or barbarians. Of course, it soon rent itself to pieces ; but not till it had dissipated all its real virtues in a showy social suicide. Upper Communism, still more self- complacently, attempts the same ; whether it level-up or level-down. Brotherhood is the most strong and active stratum of the family; but how long could it last if the others were removed</page><page sequence="35">33 The one safeguard against all this dereliction is a real Sense of the Unseen. In other words, the prophet's function not only comes first in time, but lies at the base in the working Constitution. And in all construction the most fundamental is the most essential; if the basis be unsound, the very strength and vigour of the rest but hastens its destruction. This even in material building; but in organic structure every operation repeats, in prin¬ ciple, the order, and correlation, of the growth; so that the living organism has within itself, and represents in miniature, or microcosm, aud apparently in every vital act, the whole creative process, from its own highest down¬ wards. Only by the healthy action of each primal function, therefore, and each in its order, does the whole life proceed. And this is equally true, and profoundly important, in Social, as in Individual, Physiology—as expanded in our " Social Principles." Article 15. THE BIBLE. As Faith is the Personal Engine of the Holy Ghost; God's Witness in the Individual; and the Church, His Social Engine: His Witness in the living World; the City set upon a Hill;—So the Bible is His Literary Engine: His Witness in this growing "world of Letters," which'embodies and enables progressive thought, and multiplies intellectual intercourse. And its Patriarch also: the great First-Begotten of the Books, as well as their Prophet and Apostle :—and ought to be so affirmed in all developed Creeds. In form it is but the completed History of the Jewish Church ; recording its experience, insight, and inspiration for the guidance of the world—written by individuals often unknown, but moved, evidently, by the Highest Spirit; and accepted, preserved, canonized, by the Body of the Church, upon No other attestation, evidence, or authority than the felt Value of its words them¬ selves. This was always the Prophetic Guarantee, as distinguished from the Priestly; which only had a formal lineage and ordination. And collectively it is, simply, the Prime Effort of Literature to raise and consecrate itself by speaking out for God ; and to embody its insight in this new form of Utter¬ ance ; which indeed its Authors virtually created, and cultured to that high pitch, before there was any other Alphabet, or Writing in the world at all. Like all God's gifts, it comes to us first upon Authority—the authority of Parentage, the Church, Society—but, like all authority, it must verify itself in its results. And these constitute, in time, its proper Evidence; that to which believer and unbeliever must alike appeal. To seek for any other evidence of Revelation except " Itself and its Effects," or the fruit it bears, is palpably like imposing a thistle for a fig, or lighting a lamp to help us to see the Sun. And to affect building, like some conventional theologies, " Religion upon the Book; the Book upon External Evidence; and that Evidence Miracles;" is like an elaborate attempt to uproot an immense Cathedral in order to balance it, anew, upon its steeple. And this without adding that their definition of Miracle, " suspension or violation of Nature's Laws," is a still more obvious piece of dualism:—as if Nature's Laws were not all God's Laws, and any violation of them always visited by Him.</page><page sequence="36">81 It is a like mistake and injury to idolize its Letter ; or to cumber it with a supposed " minute accuracy7," or pretended " infallibilitv," which its every page plainly disdains and repudiates. The real Infallibility of Faith, the Church, the Bible, as well as of Nature, Providence, and Grace, is defined in our Second Article. But too great diligence cannot be used in bringing it face to face with the people, both inside and outside the Church; as far as Literature can reach; and, generally, in the simplest form—if only with Bedouin robe and leathern girdle—and with or without other helps to its interpretation. Freely read, it is its own Interpreter. And one Great and Obvious Duty in this respect remains still strangely unfulfilled. It must be printed in such a form that the people can learn to read it for themselves. This is done, indeed, and well done, thanks to the Latin Alphabet and the Modern Press, in all of Christendom itself. But not outside ; and, signally, not in the East, to which we owe so much of it. There, the modes of thought and speech are cognate with Israel's; and their languages themselves easy and interesting; but their Orthography is so grotesque, complicated, and overgrown with artificial difficulties, that " learning to read" is virtually confined to a professional class, who stand between the people and all diffused literature, or independent, intellectual culture. The Bible is already Translated into these languages ; and so far well. But it must be also Transliterated into them;—that is, their own versions of it, with other books, and letters generally, must be printed and circulated—not in their own laborious, quasi-scientific, and unreadable corruptions of the old Hebrew Alphabet—but in the plain and simple Character with which the practical genius of Rome and the Roman Church have endowed the world; and which is vastly more capable of expressing all their sounds than any of their own. The Bible Societies could easily do this; the Missionary, and other Schools, could easily teach it to young and old; and if Governments, or even Commercial Firms, would only call for transliterated copies of the documents addressed to them; such a valuable simplification of essential intercourse would quickly commend itself to the interests and ambitions of the people. Until this is done, we cannot pretend that we have even yet offered them the Bible. Article 16. THE SACRAMENTS. Sacraments are the Central Ordinances of the Church; Signs, Seals, Tokens of her " Covenants :"—of the acknowledged Intermediation between God and us : more generally, of God-in-His-Creation—setting forth, by selected and explained Emblems, this Mutuality or Relationship, with its Rights, Duties, and corresponding Sentiments ;—Appointed Centres, there¬ fore, of all expressed or embodied Religion. The Emblems may be varied; and each is intended to " represent" or " signify" some side or aspect of that Real Presence, as exhibited in History—such as Birth, Nutrition, Consecra¬ tion, Burial—which the associated services expound and emphasize. And such Ordinances are to be kept or observed by the Body of the Church, upon Authority; and whetlier understood or not; with the obvious,</page><page sequence="37">36 and professed purpose of encouraging, or obliging, earnest Inquiry into then- Meaning. As this is sought, they become Acted Parables ; growing daily more significant and suggestive, with the growth of our Faculties and Insight; and gradually centralizing our Regards, not on any of its feigns, but on The Signified. The Creed names only two Sacraments, those Fundamental and most Authoritative, as Instituted by Christ Himself. But others are -uffieiently recognized by Him and His apostles ; and are justly utilized by the Church, as the Key-Stages, or Key-Acts, of Nature's, and of Human, Life. All the Visible, or rather the Living-Visible, is essentially of the nature of a Sacra¬ ment—" An Outward Sign or Symbol of The Invisible; and, to Faith or Insight, a means whereby we receive the same." Anything, therefore, or everything, might be made a Sacrament; and, to the spiritually-minded, are habitually such. But for Teaching, and for making it effective by well-marked steps or stages, Seven are sufficient: if only as adopting the emblematic significance assigned to that number by both Church and Scripture— " perfectness-in-operation"—specially applicable, therefore, to the Spirit's influences in the Church. We accept Seven, therefore, but not exactly the same seven as the Roman Church. They naturally rim thus— 1. Baptism; or that of Birth and New-Birth—the thankful acceptance of the Babe who " is born ;" and the solemn engagement that, so far as rests on us, he shall be born again, of water and the Spirit, " and lead the rest of his life according to this beginning." 2. Eucharist; or the Lord's Supper ; the Sacrament of " Confirmation," or Strengthening in the Faith. More generally, of Growth and Nutri¬ tion, natural and spiritual: with the solemn admission that it proceeds by sacrifice and self-sacrifice—of "these creatures," unconsciously, for us; of ourselves, consciously and intelligently-, for one another— following the Great Example. By such " transubstantiation," all natural growth proceeds; by the Higher, yet strictly analogous, " Communion," All Higher. 3. The Sabbath* ; Nature's great Rest-and-Reflection Stage—wherein, as [* There should be " Church Days" appointed for the special celebration of these Sacraments. As thus— No. 1. As soon after birth as convenient. No. 2. Beginning with " Confirmation;" when the age of discretion and responsibility is fairly reached. Previously, all the Means of Grace have been indirectly shared. No. 3. On 1st November and 1st May; that is, on All Saiuts' Day, and Harvest-Home ; and on Mary's, Maia's, or Mother-Nature's Gala-Festival— the Ileflective Evening-and-Morning of the Creative Year. No. 4. On the Occasion: the Crowning Day of life. No. 5. On entering any Profession, or any stage of one; or even on Abode, though it were but a temporary Beth-El. No. 6. On Ash Wednesday aud Lent. No. 7. When the Great Angel seems approaching.]</page><page sequence="38">36 in night or winter, the inner transformation is elaborated, and the new reflective life educed. The Holy Sacrament, therefore, of Work, and Rest, and Higher Work, to inspire a Higher Week. It imme¬ diately evolves Worship, and the Profession of Religion—themselves also eminently Sacramental—and rises, finally, to a Sacrament of Reverence and Duty : or, Obedience to morally-discerned Law. 4. Marriage; or the Central Sacrament of Unity and-Love : natural, social, and Divine—Emblem of the Union of Christ with His Church, and of God with His Creation. In this Union and Communion all the Family of God is conceived, is educed, is educated—in Faith, in Hope, and in "Blessed," or Productive, Love. 5. Orders; or " Consecration;" the Sacrament of " Blessedness," or Holi¬ ness as such: first "outward," gradually becoming "True"—the " setting aside" a Part to Special and Diviner Use, in order to reach a Higher Point, whence, finally, to inspire and elevate the rest. The Sacrament, therefore, of Order, Subordination, Distribution, and appointed Rule—of the Divine Constitution of Society as such, both in Church and State, under its Invisible Head: with its Natural Grades, Stages, Steps, whereby the aspiring climb, and all are kindly regulated and directed. It involves also the Institution of Property, with all its natural Laws—Consecrated from Above. 6. Penitence; the Divine Sacrament of Sorrow, Suffering, Sympathy, and Forgiveness of Sins—wherein, if only through the crushing sense of Need, the Divine Sympathy is sought and found. It may be also called, therefore, the Sacrament of Earnestness, or Prayer ; and, on its passive side, of Resignation, Peace. 7. Extreme Unction ; " anointing the body beforehand to its burial;" that is, with the Symbol of the Holy Ghost, who works, and will work, Resurrection and Transfiguration—the Genesis of the Spiritual Body. This is a very fitting Consecration, therefore, of the Death-bed and the Grave. Of course, outward participation in the Sacraments, or in anything, has no effect upon the mind or soul, except so far as it stimulates their energies, and draws them into exercise. This the Sacraments are specially calcu¬ lated, and, from the constant action of the Church around, certain to do, for either good or evil. For there is no necessary " Grace" in any Sacra¬ ment ; but only, according to their use, " Grace, or its opposite;"—the soul's "health" and growth, on one hand; its abiding, its terribly abiding, "loss" upon the other—for this is the real meaning of the strong Scripture terms employed. As Obedience to high, nay Divine, Authority, participation is never indifferent; but always in itself good. But always the Highest Good is the most fatal in its abuse; if wrongly, or even carelessly employed. Even God's Name must not be had in vain; and Prayer itself is often " an abomination." In their average or total effect upon Society, however, these Central Services of the Church are, no doubt, not only " a means," but the usual</page><page sequence="39">37 and most effective means, of all the highest Grace bestowed. They are the iwints d'appui, or fulcra, of her organic action; and, without them, all her machinery would be loose, dislocate, and ill-directed. The outward Pro¬ fessing "Body" of the Church—as St. Paul is careful to explain, e.g. 1 Cor. xi. to xiv.—is the "Social Body of Christ;" the Highest Work and Embodiment of the Holy Ghost now present upon this Globe, or anywhere within our cognizance ; and the highest " Spiritual" terms are applied to it accordingly. Its action, indeed, is mostly indirect, and " mediating;" but not, on that account, the less intended or effectual. Article 17. "LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY;" AND SOCIAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES. Fraternity, we have seen, is a most important element in Society ; repre¬ senting its expansion iu energetic Grades ; and especially of value in initial and transition Epochs ; when new principles are grasped, and would propagate themselves. After Pentecost, Christianity itself was such a movement of " Apostles and Brethren;" and the early stages of Israel were quite analogous. We cannot wonder, therefore, that it is a chief working principle in the Church; and all expansion-projects and Associations start from it. We have also noticed its danger of over-estimating or even of over-strengthening itself ; to the injury, alike, of those above and those below its level; to the shallowing and impoverishment of ail. And that this was the principle of its one supposed success, the Hellenic Demos;—which rapidly developed, mainly at the expense of others, a brilliant and imposing Culture; and, almost as rapidly, vapoured away in clouds the great energies, intelligence, integrity, and manhood of Old Greece. A process very easily repeated by supposed Enlightenment, especially if tinged with Greek ideas; and which, we saw, dissipated the Eastern Life of Christianity itself. Long after it had destroyed Greece Proper, its showy platitudes, under the names of enlightenment and liberty, were popular, or quasi-popular, as far as the Greek fame and literature extended:—soon interpreted, as it reached the lower strata, into "communism;'' and known, flattered, and dreaded in all the Cities of the East. Surrounded, and partly, perhaps, misled, by its influence, it is not htrange that the first gush of self-sacrifice and brotherly love after Pentecost was attracted or betrayed by this " augel of light;" and seriously endeavoured to establish a " community of goods." With the natural results. The Experiment itself lasted a few months, or weeks; till the Capital was consumed; but the permanent effect was the serious demoralization of that section of the Church. As long as we have history the begging-box was going around the Gentile cities " for the poor saints in Jerusalem ;" who, if steady and industrious, should have been quite as well off as they ; and who received the alms with the utmost ingratitude towards their benefactors. Plato's " community of wives" was also mooted; and one of the deacons—elected to control the disputes arising from the daily distribution—" Nicholas, a proselyte of Antioch,'' is mentioned in this connection. The whole procedure was eminently Greek; and, in both its</page><page sequence="40">38 " ideas," utterly abhorrent to all Jewish precedent or principle. Those sent on a Prophetic Mission, indeed, were often called to separate themselves, Nazar-like. from common ties, or even common intercomse; and they some¬ times instituted Bmall distinctive brotherhoods ; but only very hasty zeal could apply these, unguardedly, to the wide effort after Pentecost; though aided by the fact that Christianity itself wns a development of the prophet- and synagogue side of the Constitution, as distinguished from the Priestly. The Liberty, or "freedom" of any such social or political brotherhood, obviously, is only "privilege"—"certain rights" held, in a rude equality, by those within the body; denied to those without;—So that any general pro¬ fession of Liberty or Equality by it was plain self contradiction. And its practice is seen to be quite as inconsistent as its principles ; which owe their plausibility only to ambiguous terms. Liberty and Fraternity we have described. Equality is more Hellenic; and would have no influence—for there is obviously no real equality, among things, among men, or even among brothers—were it not that it is readily mistaken for such profound principles as Equity in Law and Morals, Equivalence and Quantivalence in things. " Are not all men born equal ?" it is asked. Born nearly equal to zero, we admit:—lb it affirmed we should continue so? But, indeed, men are no more " born equal" to one another, than mice or monkeys are born equal to them. " Are we not all equal in the sight of God ?" No :—As compared with God, we are all cyphers certainly ; but cyphers are just as unequal as any points or units, and one may be a differential of the other. In the sight of God, we are all as God sees us to be ; as He has made us; all different; and as unequal as men are. The diversity of men, and of things, is absolutely infinite; God makes no two of them, or two parts of them, exactly alike, in any respect whatever. And the Constitution of tilings is a graduated, legulated, pervading Inequality — pervaded also, however, by- Equity, Equi\alence, Quantivalence, careful measurement, and carefully- proportioned retribution:—&amp;o that the last may be first, and the first last; and the most humble or aggrieved much " more-than-compem-ated"—as well as by vastly Profounder Principles, which can provide for the least deserving, for the most despairing, " far more abundantly than we can ask or think." And our Rights and Duties, in this School of Balanced Inequalities, may¬ be all bimimid up as in our "First Principles." The Strong are entitled always to a fair field and no favour. The Weak to a fan- field and All the Favour the Others can Afford to give. For this, we all look up to Him Who Can Afford; and what we hope to receive, let us aspire to give. Article 18. GOOD, EVIL; VIRTUE, VICE; BLESSEDNESS AND SIN. The Upward Movement of Creation gives an easy definition of these terms. Whatever helps or favours It is Good; whatever impedes or mars it, Evil. To do these consciously and intentionally is Virtue, Vice ; religiously, or with a sense of the divine, Piety or Sin. In All, Carelessness is quite as Culpable as Wilfulness itself ; And Wilful Ignorance is the First Mortal Sin.</page><page sequence="41">39 It comes, or will come, nearly to the same to say, as is often said—They are all measured by " the law of God." For this Is His Prime Command or Will—of which all the rest are only Secondaries—Be Created ; Grow, or strive to grow, into the likeness of the Father. And it is much the same to say—" All things, as works of God, are good, or very good ; and only become evil by misplacement or abuse"—for it is this line of movement that "places" tilings ; and calls on each to knep its place ; which, the same law adds, can only be done by bettering it; for the place is " not a fixed, but a progressive one." Life is a " struggle for more-than-existence." And why Don't we keep our place? Why Won't we, sometimes? Why Can't we, very often Is not this defective or disproportioned management in the Maker No ; but only Comprehensive Management—of nascent, pro- gres:-ive, and creative, or new-creative lines ;—No ; if an object be to elicit and educate Reflection, deliberate Choice, intentional Co-operation-or what we call Morality;—No ; if God desires to have Children ; whose Wills, self¬ consciously, conspire with His. Obedience to Natuial law is rewarded by Growth and its effects ; disobedience, punished by degiadation and its con¬ sequences. Brutes don't much mind these;—So Higher Sensitiveness, higher pleasure and pain, is added to the life and its directive power. By stimu¬ lating Memory, these, in turn, elicit Thought, Foresight; discernment of Consequences, and of Higher Law ; sense of Duty, Deseit, Responsibility; and Morality has begun. In time this is wrought into Systems; and men are promised Happiness, as reward for self-commanding Virtue. Next, men run after Happiness direct; and—Miss both It and Virtue. They have " gone off the line;" pursuing not Duty, but one of Her Atten¬ dants. While a sturdier philosophy pursues Virtue Alone; discarding happiness, or, at least, pleasuie and pain, as mere degrading or disturbing influences. But this also fails ; for the Motive is too feeble and disputed, and the temptations are too strong. Higher Incitement must be given, and a distincter Aim. The Affections must be neither brow-beaten nor dissipated ; but strengthened, elevated, re-inspired, and centred on the One Supreme. Then Holiness lifts both Righteousness and Knowledge; and Grace and Blessedness can conquer Sin. But only with intense warfare, and struggle, and anguish; and the deepest Human Sacrifices of All that man holds dear. And is not this also very hard, or still harder, Management of God? Yes ; very hard ; if He left us to hear it all; and did no more. But if He be with us in it all; and bear it with us; and from the Depth of His Sympathies distil us Hope, Tenderness, Compressed Affection, and Satisfactions wonderful; that change our very- anguish into Joy—if He make the very Trial and the Fall an Engine for bathing us in the nearer Communion of His Heart—then both the Hardship and the Mystery disappear. The Cross has done its Work. The Lord-the- Christ—God-in-Suffering-Sympathy— has Reconciled us to Himself. It should be added that "Blessedness" is the proper and Christian term for man's Reward, Here and hereafter, as distinguished from the worldly and quasi-philosophic "Happiness." The direct pursuit of either is indeed a partial misdirection, and tends to frustrate itself. But the first is at least</page><page sequence="42">40 vastly higher pitched; where the curve and asymptote approach; and the aberration can be corrected. But the lower pursuit is a palpable running after Atalanta's Apples ; or turning aside to sport among the brooks and flowers :—very nice for butterflies and children ; but we were born for Better. Indeed, in the Christian Mythology, the Prince of the Flies and butterflies— not of the stronger passions or ambitions, but of the pretty trifles which charm away and dissipate our Purpose—is "the Prince of all the Devils." We are at war ; we have arm", courage, guidance, and ambition. Our most fatal enemies are the Attractions round, which fritter our Resolve, and be¬ witch and narcotize our Sense of Duty. The true Soldier will despise nothing, except by comparison; He will seek The One Thing ; All the rest will " add" themselves in time. Article 19. JUSTIFICATION, REDEMPTION, SANCTLFICATION, AND ETERNAL LIFE. Justifying and Sanctifying are simply " making righteous" and " making holy ;" and, in general, by the process indicated. Both words and their synonyms are properly used either of the Whole process ; or of those large transition-steps, which markedly, and sometimes violently, Change our life; and are called variously " conversion," "new-birth," "regeneration," "re¬ newal," &amp;c or even " transformation." But a question underlies them all; due, no doubt, to our deep sense of Law—possibly, to our Superficial, Formal, or even Hellenic notions of it. Vice and Sin having been committed; the conscience and character defiled; and God, His Law, and the Spirit of His Law, offended—Can the truest sorrow and repentance wash these away? Will they, or such as they, even with all the Spirit's Help, set us " at one" with God Does not His Law and Character forbid it; and the Order, Con¬ stitution, Character of Things, require some Ransom, Redemption, Satisfac¬ tion, or Atonement And Whence can this arise Nature, certainly, never forgets anything ; nor, in this sense, forgives. Even the loss of life or limb, from the most accidental or innocent violation of her laws, is beyond recall. Providence is the same ; and even visits the offences of the father on the children ; of the commander, the rider, or even of the traitor, on the aimy or the multitude. Is Grace different? Does not our Lord Himself affirm that it is not That the right hand, or right eye, lost through sin, or even in the endeavour to escape from sin ; will not be restored again ; that we must " enter into life" thus maimed and mutilate ; and that, generally, the consequences of our works will be as abiding as ourselves Now ; is this Equitable Wise Merciful or, even if, on the whole, it be, yet—considering WJiat we are and Who has made us so—is it not Extremely Hard Much Legalism is spoken on this subject—more perhaps than ought to be—more certiinly than Thought can answer—until we call to mind the '• Reconcilement" of last Article ; We remember that we are but dust; and Who has made us so : —Can we imagine that He forgets it or fails to bear it in His Mind and Heart If He did, were He our Father, or the Father of</page><page sequence="43">41 the Christ Nay, When the Maker takes it on Himself, Thought will con¬ firm what Instinct feels ; In His Real Presence, All must be at Peace. The abstract difficulties disappear. Can we see How Yes : at least as to His modes of working. Not by the method of " forgiving and forgetting," but by Farther-giving—by far-more- abounding Grace. By enforcing all the just, and justly threatened, penalties, and out-embracing them with Love. By making the penalties themselves, and the distress they bring, to open the door into the farther Treasure House, and make our very depth of need, to touch the Depth and Height of the Resources Infinite. Thus every Law is but a Schoolmaster to bring us up to Christ; and then, with Christ, we pass-through the Penalty, and find our¬ selves—at Home. Nature and Providence forgive not or forget—but they have Immense Quantivalents which misery, mutilation, death, can seek and find. And all these have to give are but parables and foretastes of what GRACE has in store. Insight and Experience, then, may well rejoice ; as even Hope sinks to rest on the bosom of Almighty Love, and the Mercy that endureth for ever. Indeed, Sensitiveness or Feeling itself belongs to Communion, and is of the nature of Fellow-Feeling. Not the lost drop of blood, 01 eye, or limb, itself, feels pain ; but the living parts adjacent, and the nerve-system of higher life. These, bereaved and distressed, struggle to repair, or more-than- compensate. Is the Upper Sympathy less true, vivid, or successful Crea¬ tion escapes neither Law, nor Consequences ; but the consequences are manifold, elastic, and Divine. She suffers much ; but Deity Himself suffers with Her; and His Sympathies are All the Wealth that All Creation ever can receive. Fiom " before the foundation of the World," God-in-Christ took up Creation's Cross ; and has laid it, manifestly, not alone on His Exemplar and Personal Embodiment, but on His Social and His Cosmic also—so far as Each can bear, or hardly bear, the Load. Let us at least st) ive to bear it After Him. And though we must follow to the Dark—aye, into the very Dark of, apparently, God-Forsakedness and Curse—yet in the very Depth, or after it, we shall find ourselves with Him.; and when we Awake up after His Likenesss, like Him, we shall be more than satisfied. Article 20. GOD'S PURITY, JEALOUSY, JUDGMENT, AND ETERNAL INDIGNATION. Thus Salvation is no Superficial Whitewashing—no legal Imputation of a Righteousness which is not there, or overlooking an Unrighteousness that is—whether for the sake of Doctrine, Ordinance, Any one's Entreaties; or of any imagined Covenant, Stipulation, or Dead-works whatever. It is the Soul's Life and Health; and it "cost more" than all these may touch, o redeem one throb of it from Death. Much less is it any Geographical Privileue—any inclusion, in any Heaven or Hell, of any one whose Character and Fitness have not sent him there, and enabled him to stay. Each shall receive a fair field and All the Favour that God and Things can give. But What sort of God, or What Constitution of Things could Afford such Partialities as these or could Tolerate any such unequal, unjust, unchristian</page><page sequence="44">42 Distribution Nay, The Judge of all the World will assuredly do Right. He is of purer eyes than to behold Iniquity; especially in His Temple ; or in any of His real or pietended Service ; and very little paltering with it will go far with Him—a very Severe and Searching ; and very Jealous God! His Fan and Fire begin always with Jehovah's House, and its most central Holy Place. From His own Essential Nature He must purify, purge off, consume away " all things that offend, and whatsoever maketh or loveth a lie." If it were not so—even to our conception and conviction—He could Not be—GOD :— and His Indignation against Sin is just as Eternal as Himself. Let all false Gods, therefore, with all their forms and ordinances, and pretended principles, be utterly abolished;—\nd let the Truth, the Simple Truth, be sought; and, therefore, Found. It is not far from Each of us. " In thy mouth; and in thy heart; if thou wilt"—Obey it. Printed at the Derry Sentinel Office.</page></plain_text>
