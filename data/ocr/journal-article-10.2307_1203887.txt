<plain_text><page sequence="1">Coleridge and the Logos: The Trinitarian Unity of Consciousness and Culture James W. Clayton / University of the South Coleridge's overall intellectual effort can profitably be viewed in the light of his post-Kantian interpretation of the Prologue to the Fourth Gos- pel, where a Trinitarian concept is adumbrated and the concept of the Logos is introduced as being, on the one hand, eternally "with God" and, on the other, the light "which lighteth every man that cometh into the world."' This interpretation ought, I think, to be of crucial interest to any- one seeking to understand Coleridge because it is one of the themes that give continuity to his career as a mature thinker. It permeates his writing not only in the later period from about 1820, when explicit theological speculation dominated his work, but also in the period between 1815 and 1818 when, after more than a decade of reflection upon his conversion from Unitarian to Trinitarian Christianity and his discovery of Kant and the German Idealists, he produced the works in which his aesthetic and metaphysical theories culminate.2 There is no question that, for Coleridge, not only is the indwelling Logos or "Christ" identified with reason but reason, in its ultimate opera- tions, is virtually equivalent to love. Obviously, in the Fourth Gospel, "Logos" means love, and the equation of reason with love had been made before, in Coleridge's generation most notably by Hegel. Coleridge's line of thought, however, is significantly his own, and the biggest single ques- 'John 1:1, 9. 2 The Biographia Literaria, in The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, no. 7, ed.

The longer-range goal is to show that in Coleridge's thought-especially his pre-1820 thought-the experiences and insights of high culture are directly continuous with, indeed only comprehensible in terms of, the ordinary consciousness of ordinary peo- ple because consciousness itself owes its emergence and its underlying character to the universally indwelling "Christ," or reason. Discussions of this cluster of ideas, especially the meaning and function of reason, have always been remarkably sketchy. Respectful references are common, but not detailed epistemological analyses. Everyone asserts the importance of reason to Coleridge, and few students of the subject would deny that in his concept of reason he wants to combine a (radically revised) version of Kant and the Christian Logos; but exactly how he con- ceives of such a synthesis, and exactly how it determines his view of the way the mind operates, seem not to have been closely investigated.3 I There is no doubt-Coleridge himself asserts it repeatedly-that he always thinks of reason in Platonic terms as the power of the mind to apprehend eternal reality beyond what is accessible to the physical senses. Two of his more famous observations may be cited: Reason (says our great Hooker) is a direct aspect of truth, an inward beholding, A number of books have, however, been helpful in pointing me toward the analysis I am attempting. J. R. de J. Jackson, in a chapter of his important book Method and Imagination in Coleridge's Criticism (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1969), pp. 75-79, discusses the importance to Coleridge of a relevation of "the Logos, or Communicative Intelligence" through the unconscious and stresses the function of reason in this connection. Jackson, however, does not explain what Coleridge thinks is the actual process and content of such revelation (see no. 20 below). J. A. Appleyard's Coleridge's Philosophy ofLiterature: The Development of a Concept ofPoetry, 1791-1819 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1965) argues provocatively that Coleridge's development of the concept of reason is related to the failure of his effort, culminat- ing in the Biographia and doomed by his antipathy to pantheism, to elevate imagination from the explicitly aesthetic function of relating mind and nature and make it the power that constitutes the ground and source of both. Richard Haven's Patterns of Consciousness: An Essay on Coleridge (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1969) emphasizes the importance to Coleridge of the Trinitarian God and of participation in an infinite self-consciousness as the key to his concept of consciousness generally; but Haven does not analyze this process or specifically explain how reason is involved in it. Owen Barfield, in his important though rather impressionistic and some- times obscure work, What Coleridge Thought (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1971), takes as Coleridge's key principle the unity of polar opposites and does discuss the mean- ing of reason and the Trinity. The focus of his attention, however, is on the relation between mind and nature; my own effort is to see this principle as discoverable in a moral experience at the basis of consciousness. 214</page><page sequence="3">Coleridge and the Logos having a similar relation to the intelligible or spiritual, as Sense has to the mate- rial or phenomenal.4 I should have no objection to define reason with Jacobi, .... as an organ bearing the same relation to spiritual objects, the Universal, the Eternal, and the Neces- sary, as the eye bears to material and contingent phaenomena.5 Coleridge refers here to Hooker, and indeed there is nothing in these characterizations of reason as a kind of spiritual "eye" that had not been said countless times over many centuries, though perhaps not often so felicitously. But Coleridge claims to be a modern thinker, one touched by Kant as "by a giant's hand"6 and dedicated to opening the eyes of his English-speaking readers to the new vistas disclosed by Kant's revolution.7 Both of the just-quoted statements, taken as they stand, are of course completely non-Kantian. As Coleridge himself well knew, for Kant the ideas of reason-as distinct from the categories of the "understanding"- are "regulative," not "constitutive." They organize our phenomenal awareness into an ever more complete system and thus make science possi- ble, but they provide no contact with a reality beyond the realm of appear- ance of which the data of sense experience are an essential component. Coleridge early on parts company with Kant by treating the ideas of rea- 4Aids to Reflection (hereafter referred to as Aids), in the Complete Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. W. G. T.

His Platonic view of reason as a faculty of supersensuous vision and as an indwelling divine moral force was undoubtedly influenced by his study of the seventeenth-century "Cambridge Platonists," especially Henry More and Ralph Cudworth. My concern, however, is not with the sources of this special kind of Platonism in his thought but with the kind of modern formulation and justification he gave to it through his inter- action with Kant. For a brief but accurate and judicious summary of the Cambridge Platonists' impact on Coleridge, see Claud Howard, Coleridge's Idealism: A Study of Its Relation to Kant and to the Cambridge Platonists (Boston: Gorham, 1924). Rene Wellek's famous study, Immanuel Kant in England, 1793-1838 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1931), pp. 65-135, shows deci- sively that, however Platonic or British Coleridge's ideas may have been, their articulation is inseparable from his use of Kant. However, Wellek's contemptuous dismissal of Coleridgean positions that depart from Kant-especially the interpretation of reason-shows no real interest in searching for a distinctive inner logic in such "mystical" positions. G. N. G. Orsini's Coleridge and German Idealism: A Study in the History ofPhilosophy, with Unpublished Materialsfrom Coleridge's Manuscripts (Carbondale, Ill.: Southern Illinois University Press, 1969) is helpful for its lucid exposition of the relevant German ideas (especially Kant's) and the way Coleridge encountered them, though less helpful with regard to Coleridge's own creative use of this material. Orsini also includes a discussion of Coleridge's indebtedness to Cudworth (pp. 27-29). A really masterful essay by James Engell succeeds better than anything I know in presenting a general summary of Coleridge's creative interaction with contemporary German culture (Engell, "First Postulates, Final Causes: Coleridge and German Idealism," in The Coleridge Connection: Essays in Honor of Thomas McFarland, ed. Richard Gravil [London: Macmillan, in press]). 215</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion son as "constitutive"-that is, providing direct perceptual knowledge of supersensuous reality.8 More specifically, this character is attributed to "practical" reason in its ethical function as a guide to behavior.9 But how? and what? How does practical reason "see" supersensuous reality? And what supersensuous reality does it "see"? In confronting these questions, it will be helpful to turn to his little "Essay on Faith," which was not published by Coleridge but has always been well known to his students.10 This composition, only a few pages in length, is of the greatest importance because, though it was written during his later years, it combines in a remarkable way his final Christian Trini- tarian ideas with the concerns characteristic of his earlier years, about con- sciousness as such and its relation to the external world. The Essay begins with a distinctive definition of faith. Faith is "fidelity to our own being-as far as such being is not and cannot become an object of the senses."" What is "our own being" in this statement? The answer is given in a personalized but accurate statement of the categorical imperative: That I am conscious of something within me peremptorily commanding me to do unto others as I would they should do unto me;-in other words, a categorical (that is, primary and unconditional) imperative;-that the maxim (regula maxima or supreme rule) of my actions, both inward and outward, should be such as I could, without any contradiction arising therefrom, will to be the law of all moral and rational beings;-this, I say, is a fact of which I am no less conscious (though in a different way), nor less assured, than I am of any appearance presented by my outward senses. Nor is this all; but in the very act of being conscious of this in my own nature, I know that it is a fact of which all men either are or ought to be con- scious.... I know that I possess this consciousness as a man, and not as Samuel Taylor Coleridge.'2 Somewhat later in the essay, Coleridge's own idea is made more specific when he refers to conscience as a kind of dialogue within the self, between the "I" as individual and the "I" as universal; the latter is reason ("the rea- son or super-individual of each man, whereby he is man"), and it addresses the self as an individual will ("the individual will or personalizing factor of free agency").'3 Obviously, "the reason or super-individual of each man" is what 8 In SM, he refers to "the highest problem of Philosophy" as being "Whether Ideas are regula- tive only, according to Aristotle and Kant; or likewise CONSTIrUTIVE ..., according to Plato, and Plotinus" (p. 114). 9 See SM, p. 72; Aids, p. 367n.

It is the self as universal humankind. More, however, is clearly intended. Although reason is an aspect of my own identity as a person-it is a pole of my personal consciousness-it transcends me because it addresses me. It is human selfhood, but at the same time it is a supernatural, divine presence. Such an idea is implied in Kant, but Coleridge eagerly goes beyond implication. Earlier we saw Coleridge speaking of reason as a human "faculty," a power of supersensuous vision possessed by the mind: an "inward behold- ing," an "organ." But in the "Essay on Faith" reason is that which is "seen"-it is "Reason" as well as "reason." Coleridge was always clearly aware of, and enthusiastic about, his use of the word with this double ref- erence. The recently cited passage from The Friend (1818), which refers to reason as an organ, immediately continues: "But then it must be added, that it is an organ identical with its appropriate objects."'4 In a note, also from his earlier period-between 1808 and 1818-he speaks of "Uncon- ditional obedience of the Will to the pure Reason, or Conscience/ ... the Reality of which is God.'5 More fully, in a note of 1827 added to The Statesman's Manual, he writes: "reason ... we can not otherwise define than as the capability ... of beholding, or being conscious of, the divine light. But this very capability is that light ... as a being which we may call ours, but which I cannot call mine."'6 This much is a Logos concept in the sense of a transcendent though indwelling universal selfhood, equally and inseparably divine and human. Thus far, what we have seen in the "Essay on Faith" is the concept of such a universal selfhood, or indwelling Logos, as rational moral law. Law, however, is not what Coleridge ultimately has in mind in the essay. Faith is a "fidelity" or willing self-subjection to Reason. When this state becomes reality, Reason is experienced not as law but as love: "Here then reason appears as the love of God; and its antagonist is the attachment to individ- uals wherever it exists in diminution of, or in competition with, the love which is reason.""7 Here then is the Christian Logos, the indwelling Christ. At this point I suggest an interpretation which is one of the major proposals of this article. According to Kant, reflection on the moral law gives rise to the concept of a future ideal community, a "realm of ends" in which every member treats every other as an end and never as a means, and ethical conduct is in the nature of the case directed toward the actualization of such a commu- 14Friend, 1:156. 15 The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed.

In effect, Coleridge asserts such a commu- nity as a present reality in the sense of a seminal communal force within, though also transcending, human life. The practical reason is more than an imperative. It is a power of cohesion and is so recognized whenever the human faculties are in their proper relatonship to one another. Reason as love might be called, from this point of view, a vital orderliness, of which sheer mathematical or logical coherence is only the skeleton or necessary framework. The relation between reason so understood and the functions usually associated with reason will be considered shortly; for the moment I shall simply assert that this concept of reason is the key to all Coleridge's uses of the term. In the "Essay on Faith" Coleridge expresses-as he often does-this dynamic or organic character of reason in conjunction with the idea of the association of reason and will. By doing so he can relate reason in the human mind directly to the structure of the Trinity. Faith, he says, is an "energy," and he continues: faith must be a light originating in the Logos, or the substantial reason, which is co-eternal and one with the Holy Will, and which light is at the same time the life of men. ... faith [is] the fidelity of man to God, by the subordination of his human will ... to his reason ... representing and manifesting the will Divine.'8 In a long and very important letter of 1806, perhaps twenty-five years ear- lier, he writes: God is the sole self-comprehending Being, i.e. he has an Idea of himself .... This Idea ... from all eternity co-existing with, &amp; yet filiated, by the absolute Being ... is the substantial Image of God, in whom the Father beholds well-pleased his whole Being-and being substantial o6'ooutos he of divine and permanent Will ... as delightedly &amp; with as intense LOVE contemplates the Father in the Father, and the Father in himself, and himself in the Father.'9 18 Ibid., p. 565. In a note of 1823-25, Coleridge refers to the divine Logos as "the energic Rea- son" (see Marginalia, in Collected Works [n. 2 above], no. 12, vol. 2, ed. George Whalley, [1984], p. 1175). The meaning of "will" to Coleridge, and of its relation to reason, is more complex and more puzzling than this essay indicates. For example, in God, reason (the Son) is subordinate to will (the Father, as the ultimate origin and the principle of divinity), whereas in the human self, will is associated with individual existence which should be in a state of fidelity to reason. Often "will," as applied both to human beings and to God, designates that which is constitutive of selfhood or personal being. In this respect, as in some others, the thesis presented here is too neat to do justice to the bewildering range of idea-experiements in Coleridge's corpus. The argument-intricate enough, I think, for one essay-is that the line of thought being described is in fact present in his work, that it is in itself logically conherent, and that it is of basic impor- tance to him. See James D. Boulger, Coleridge as Religious Thinker (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Uni- versity Press, 1961), pp. 127 ff., for a series of citations on the divine will from later unpublished writings. Coleridge's comments as a much younger man are consistent with these. 19 Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. Earl Leslie Griggs (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956-71), 2:1195 (hereafter referred to as Letters). 218</page><page sequence="7">Coleridge and the Logos This latter statement does not explicitly identify the Logos with Reason, but the Logos is called God's "Idea," which for Coleridge is essentially the same thing. In traditional terms, what is being stressed is of course the doctrine of perichoresis, the complete sharing of attributes by the three Trinitarian Persons. The point, for our purposes, is that the "revealed" doctrine of the Trinity-God as love, conceptualized as the union of will (Father) and reason (Son)-corresponds exactly, for Coleridge, with what is appre- hended in Christian religious experience as the ultimate core of human selfhood, explicable in modern philosophical terms. The "light" of Rea- son, source of a universal moral law, is in fact an underlying divine/ human power of community life or love. Some interesting studies of the foregoing ideas have been frustrated by simplistic views about "pantheism," especially in view of Coleridge's pre- occupation with it. The most conspicuous example is Thomas McFarland's Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition, surely one of the best books ever written on Coleridge.20 Since McFarland's work is so influen- tial, some comment on it may be in order, both as indicating a problem in Coleridge scholarship and as a way of further clarifying Coleridge's posi- tion. On the one hand, McFarland pinpoints the Trinity as the focal idea in Coleridge's thought, and with awesome scholarship and clarity he shows the significance of this fact in the context of the issues that were Coleridge's background. On the other hand, in the final analysis he gives 20 Thomas McFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1969). In some cases, such views seem to be mere assumptions, which is not true in McFarland's case. Jonathan Wordsworth classifies as "unambiguously pantheist" the above-cited passage from Friend (1:156), in which reason is called "an organ identical with its appropriate objects," as though this were obvious without demonstration (Wordsworth, "The Infinite 1 AM," in Essays in Memory of Pete Laver, ed. Richard Gravil, Lucy Newlyn, and Nicholas Rue [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985], p. 38).Jackson (n. 3 above), pp. 114-16, characterizes as sim- ply a "regrettable ambiguity" Coleridge's use of the same word for "Reason itself" and the "organ of Reason," and, in what seems a rather desperate effort to see an unambiguous concept, he pro- poses a "triple division: infinite Reason (God); and finite Reason, both as Reason itself (in man) and as the organ of Reason." But for Coleridge, consistently, "infinite Reason (God)" is "Reason itself' and is "in man," both as distinct from and identical with "the organ of Reason." On the other hand, whereas McFarland denies any real difference between "pantheism" and "panen- theism" (p. 269), Engell, in associating Coleridge with the latter, distinguishes them: panentheism "recognizes the inviolable unity of God as one separate being yet sees him simulta- neously as a presence dwelling in each part of his creation"-though "one separate being" is not precise language for speaking of a panentheistic God (James Engell, The Creative Imagination [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1981], pp. 251-52).James expresses the idea well: "Therefore the reason as it animates will and feeling is the life of man ... ; it is also a beholdment of truth. But it is not merely a beholdment; it is also the light by which we behold, and is divine, and divinely given" (D. G. James, The Romantic Comedy [New York: Oxford University Press, 1948], pp. 187-88). See also James S. Cutsinger, The Form of Transformed Vision: Coleridge and the Knowledge of God (Macon, Ga.: Mercer University Press, 1987), pp. 117, 128; and J. Robert Barth, The Symbolic Imagination: Coleridge and the Romantic Tradition (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1977), p. 118. 219</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion us only a bare sketch of what Coleridge's central idea actually is and how it relates to the problems it is intended to solve. McFarland argues that the importance, and also what is often regarded as the failure, of Coleridge's philosophical work, can be under- stood only in the context of the Pantheismusstreit which came to a climax in his generation. There are, says McFarland, only two types of meta- physical systems, what he calls the "I am" and the "It is" types.21 Spinoza is, of course, the modern father of what McFarland calls "the pantheist tradition" ("It is"), according to which reality is seen as an impersonal totality rather than in terms of individual personal consciousness ("I am"). It was Kant's great distinction-and the reason for his momentous impact on Coleridge-that he opened up the possibility of a modern "I am" alternative to the various types of Spinozism that, at the close of the eighteenth century, had won the day among thinkers and artists. McFarland thinks, however, that not only Kant's Idealist successors but Kant himself failed in their effort and ended with a new version of the "It is" philosophy. Consciousness is not, for Kant any more than for Fichte, really the existential self but the Ding-an-sich: consciousness as such, mind in general, or the Absolute Ego. McFarland thinks that Novalis's observation applies fully to Kant: "it is all the same whether I posit the universe as in me, or me as a part of the universe. Spinoza posits every- thing as outside-Fichte, everything as inside."22 What, for McFarland, is supremely admirable about Coleridge is that he saw this situation with utter clarity and refused idealist as much as materialist pantheism. Coleridge's problem as a philosopher was not that he had an unsystematic mind, but that he insisted to the death on systema- tizing what no thinker had ever successfully systematized because they cannot be systematically united-the self within and nature without-and that he did so in full awareness of the difficulties involved.23 Coleridge never lost, would not and could not ever have lost, his love for the exter- nal world; but he was even more dominated by commitment to the "I am" principle of an inner moral reality, and he could not reconcile the two. It is at this point that McFarland seems to falter. Although to the very end of the book he emphasizes Coleridge's "idiosyncratic refusal to decide, either by pantheism or by solipsistic sceptisim, that which cannot be decided,"24 these words are quoted from the final chapter, entitled "The Trinitarian Resolution," in which he somehow seems to want to say that Coleridge did decide and that he so decided as to effect a "resolu- 21 McFarland, p. 56. 22 Ibid., p. 92. 23 Ibid., pp. 109 ff. 24 Ibid., p. 254. 220</page><page sequence="9">Coleridge and the Logos tion": "by his rational acceptance of the Trinity, he found a way to staple the chain of 'I am' consequences in an extramundane ground, thus at one and the same time guaranteeing the free agency of his moral being and the reality of external nature."25 The Trinitarian concept that McFarland rightly attributes to Coleridge (who shares it with many others) is derived from the basic character of self-consciousness. The affirmation "I am" involves a Trinitarian structure of selfhood because in saying "I am" one distinguishes oneself from oneself as subject from object while at the same time asserting the identity of the two. McFarland's problem, I think, is what may be the fundamental premise of his book: that the idea of almost any kind or degree of essential unity between God and nature or God and the human mind is "pantheism," that "pantheism" in this sense is non-Christian, and that Coleridge in rejecting "the pantheist tradition" embraced the concept of deity who is transcend- ent in the sense of Karl Barth's most extreme dicta.26 He is, I suggest, unable to bring his brilliant insights to fruition because Coleridge's crucial arguments do not fit McFarland's preconceived ideas as to what Coleridge, as an orthodox Trinitarian Christian, must have thought. This may explain why McFarland provides very little analysis of the "Essay on Faith," though he quotes it at length. The results of a more complete anal- ysis are not consistent with his premise. The crux of the pantheism issue as it concerned Coleridge himself was not the general idea of divine immanence. The all-important principle for him was that the ultimate ground of selfhood is not beyond self- consciousness, the distinction of subject and object. It was Schelling's prin- ciple of Identitit that in his view was fatal. J. Shawcross, writing in 1907, saw this precisely when he identified what was "no doubt the feature most unsatisfactory to Coleridge in the Transcendental Idealism and in Schel- ling's philosophy generally": "For Schelling's absolute, which is prior to and behind self-consciousness, from which self-consciousness originates, is conceived as mere self-less identity or total indifference, of which all that can be said is that it is neither subject nor object, but the mere negation of both.... In such a system there was clearly no place for the God of Coleridge's faith, as a Spirit to whom self-consciousness is essential, a Being 'in whom supreme reason and a most holy will are one with an infi- nite power' [Confession of Faith, 1818]."27 25 Ibid., p. 220. 26 See McFarland's chapters, "Excursus Note IV: Panentheism," pp. 268-71, and "Excursus Note XVI: Coleridge's Relation to Later Theological Thought," pp. 316-20. 27j. Shawcross, "Introduction" to the Biographia Literaria (1907; reprint, New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), 1:lxix-lxx. One of the most thoughtful discussions I have seen of this principle is by A. Nicholas Reid, "The Ascertaining Vision: Coleridge and Symbol" (Ph. D. diss., Australian National University, 1988). Reid questions the propriety of Coleridge's own use of 221</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion Pantheism, says Dorothy Emmett, was "very nearly the right conclusion for him to come to," but she recognizes-though she does not explain- that his Trinitarian concept appeared to him as an alternative,28 and she cites the notebook entry: "As we recede from anthropomorphism we must go either to the Trinity or to Pantheism."" 29 Coleridge always shunned the "anthropomorphism" to which the doctrine of a transcendent deity tends, and Trinitarianism enabled him to reject pantheism while asserting that human selfhood cannot be adequately described without describing a relationship between the self and a divine reality that is a dimension of the self's own being. II Thus far, our concern has been to get at Coleridge's interpretation of the "practical reason" as being what I have called the "ultimate core of selfhood," the indwelling but transcendent love of the Trinitarian God. This concentration on the theme of the knowledge of God, through self- knowledge, was of course the major preoccupation of Coleridge's later years. However, in the "Essay on Faith" he spells out the argument of another theme that is directly related to the more characteristic interests of the earlier years of his maturity: that conscience is the basis of consciousness. To consider the meaning of consciousness is to turn from introspection to awareness of the external world, associated with sense experience. This certainly is what Coleridge means by "consciousness" in the essay and else- "subject/object" in reference to God since this is a distinction derived from the understanding and suggests Schelling's concept of self-consciousness as "a form of limitation" (p. 157). He goes too far, I think, in asserting that "three Persons" "presuppose genuine selfhood (i.e. genuine sub- jectivity)," but this leads to his most important contribution to this topic: his argument that Coleridge's late idea of a "tetraxy," or a Trinity presupposing a fourth, more primordial ground or will, does not entail a divine ultimacy beyond the Trinity ("Coleridge's 'ground' has no exis- tence apart from its realization in the Trinity: it is merely the Oneness of the Trinity"). He quotes the unpublished manuscript "On the Divine Ideas": "the depth [or ground] begetteth not, but in &amp; together with the act of self-realization the supreme mind begetteth his substantial idea ... &amp; becometh God the Father" (221-22). 28 Dorothy Emmett, "Coleridge on Powers in Mind and Nature," in Coleridge's Variety, ed. John Beer (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1975), p. 179. See McFarland, p. 320. 29 Notebooks (n. 15 above), 1:922 (1801). Richard Haven also sees this very clearly and discusses it at greater length. Haven (n. 3 above) quotes the same Notebook entry, explains the Coleridgean Trinitarian concept quite fully, and concludes that, while it "makes intelligible the notion of a God in whom we may 'live and move and have our being,' it also permits those states of mind in which we 'think of ourselves as separated beings,' in which the finite is seen not as the focusing of reality into a specific form, but as a distinct self-existing entity" (pp. 123-27). Likewise, Barfield (n. 3 above), holds that Coleridge's system "could, and perhaps ought, to be so classified [i.e., as pantheism] if his frequent and careful distinction between Father God and Son God is sedulously ignored" (p. 149). 222</page><page sequence="11">Coleridge and the Logos where in making his correlation between it and conscience. The major themes of the earlier work have to do, in a way that the essay and most of the other later writings do not, with the relation between the ultimate truth within the self and the external world of nature, art, and society. In these earlier years his general argument, I suggest, is in effect that the key to a healthy personal and cultural life is the state of mind only later explic- itly described in the "Essay on Faith": an integration of the self such that the apprehension of objective reality, and creative interaction with it, takes place in the context of reason as love. What does this mean more specifically? Coleridge asserts in several places, both earlier and later, that practical reason is the basis of all func- tions of reason. Art especially seems to have for the younger Coleridge a function in the actualization of a fulfilled human existence that, although not as basic as for Schelling, nevertheless is of essential importance. How is this related to his entire system of thought? Furthermore, in this light, how does Coleridge view ordinary consciousness and the life of ordinary people? If the highest visions of science and art are rooted in the very nature of the self-in a divine reality within every human being-what does this say about the character of knowledge as such, and of the mode of perception characteristic of the masses of people who are not geniuses? If the basic human fact is the indwelling Logos, then is consciousness itself derived from love? The question is important for an understanding of Coleridge. He was like Kant's German Idealist successors in wanting to show that religion is intrinsic to the human mind, not an optional feature added on to some minds and absent from others. More specifically, he is like Schleiermacher in that one of his basic concerns is to demonstrate that religion is indispen- sable to the most highly developed cultural life; indeed, that religion is the only bond that can make of the various scientific and humanistic enter- prises one cultural whole, while at the same time binding together "high culture" with the common life of a society so as to prevent the fragmenta- tion of culture that he saw as the great threat to the modern world. Undoubtedly this partly explains the fact that reason is his crucial concept since reason is at the same time common to all human beings and explicitly suggestive of the most sophisticated cultural activities. If it can be shown that the principle stated in the "Essay on Faith"-that conscience is the basis of consciousness-is the key to all his thinking on this matter in the earlier as well as later periods of his maturity, then the crucial question is this: does consciousness come about as the result of a split between reason and the individual will, or does it emerge in the con- text of an original union between them? Is the birth of consciousness asso- ciated with the awareness of law or of love? If the former, then consciousness is a kind of fall and intrinsically entails sin, as it does for 223</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion Hegel. Coleridge, both as a person and as a thinker, was at all times so sen- sitive to the depth of moral evil that it is natural to read his principle, "con- science as the basis of consciousness," in this light. If this should be correct, then on Coleridge's principles dualism inevitably follows. Among many differences between him and Hegel is this: Coleridge has no histori- cal dialectic. The idea of a "fortunate fall" is totally alien to him. As far as I am aware, he never suggests that sin is the necessary price to be paid for a more complex and profounder culture. For him, sin is purely and simply a disaster. Culture obviously presupposes consciousness. Therefore if con- sciousness as such is inherently sinful, then culture becomes suspect and religious regeneration becomes important simply in itself, an integration of the self unrelated to the cultural enterprise. Salvation tends to be thought of as a wholly new and different consciousness, an inner relation to God that turns the mind away from the external world. The tendency to such a dualism was always present in him and grew stronger as the years passed. On the other hand, it is equally true that he always wanted the Johannine principle of the universally indwelling Logos of love to be the cornerstone of his thought structure, and the argument here will be that there is at work a discoverable concept of the Trinitarian love as the basis of consciousness. The concept is not, however, immediately apparent. It is again the "Essay on Faith" that gives Coleridge's most explicit state- ment on the relationship between subject-object consciousness and reason: Brutes may be, and are scious, but those beings only, who have an I, scire possunt hoc vel illud una cum seipsis; that is, conscire vel scire aliquid mecum, or to know a thing in relation to myself.... Now the third person could never have been distinguished from the first but by means of the second. There can be no He [or It] without a previous Thou.30 Conscire, to be conscious, is to "know with": to know objects distinct from oneself in relation to oneself. If I think about an object, I set it apart from, or distinguish it from, myself; I know it as being "out there," beyond myself. I know it as "not me," and to know something as being not me means that I "know me," in other words, that I am self-conscious. This consciousness of oneself as an individual is derived, he says, from the awareness of being addressed by a "Thou," and the "Thou" he has in mind is explicitly identified with "the reason or super-individual of each man.""31 30 Shedd, ed. (n. 4 above), 5:559. 31 Here, it seems to me, is a very important-perhaps the most important-example of the way in which McFarland's antipantheist premises prevent him from giving an exact exposition of what the Trinity means for Coleridge. He devotes several pages to this section of the "Essay" (pp. 224</page><page sequence="13">Coleridge and the Logos Consciousness of an external world is therefore dependent on moral awareness, awareness of a universal human/divine identity that is usually experienced as a legal imperative but is in fact, by his interpretation, love. In this context Coleridge introduces the concept of "understanding," which from the time of his first acquaintance with Kant, Fichte, and Schelling he always distinguishes from reason. The distinction, he regu- larly insists from that time until his death, is the key to his philosophy. Here he calls understanding "the faculty of the finite": The faculty of the finite is that which reduces the confused impressions of sense to their essential forms,-quantity, quality, relation, and in these action and reaction, cause and effect, and the like; thus raises the materials furnished by the senses and sensations into objects of reflection, and so makes experience possible.32 This of course is simply a paraphrase of Kant. For Kant, the understand- ing contains the logical forms of judgment (the "categories"), in terms of which-along with space and time-the mind synthesizes the "manifold" of sense experience into a unity that constitutes the interrelated objects of conscious empirical awareness. When Coleridge speaks of "consciousness" as derived from conscience, it is this Kantian concept that he assumes. The universal human tendency, says Coleridge early and late, is to allow understanding to become detached and to function as if it were itself rea- son. This in effect is what he means by sin, and he never tires of explaining and denouncing it. It is the key to his criticism of modern society. In this connection, Coleridge's idea of understanding goes beyond Kant's, as do Schelling's and Hegel's. A brief definition in The Friend encapsulates the two aspects of his idea: the faculty by which we generalize and arrange the phaenomena of perception: that faculty, the functions of which contain the rules and constitute the possibil- ity of outward Experience.33 The second half of this definition, following the colon, is Kant's concept. But the "generalizing" and "arrangement" refer to something closer to Kant's "regulative" function of reason. They have to do with the analysis of the objects of experience, with making distinctions, classifying, manipu- lating, and adapting means to ends. The world as perceived simply by the understanding consists of separate units in mechanical relation to one 236-42) but never makes quite clear what he thinks Coleridge means by the "Thou." To identify it with indwelling divine reason-as I think Coleridge obviously does-would be incompatible with McFarland's denial of any essential unity of the divine and human in Coleridge's theory, and McFarland omits any mention of the "reason or super-individual of each man" in this connection. 32 Shedd, ed., 5:562. 33 Friend (n. 2 above), 1:156. 225</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion another--"an immense heap of little things.""34 For the understanding, everything is an object, and "every object is, as an object, dead, fixed, inca- pable in itself of any action, and necessarily finite."35 As the "Essay on Faith" explains, such a mode of predominatng awareness comes about when the individual personal will separates itself from Reason; it then becomes simply an individual, living for itself as an individual, and there- fore seeing all of reality as a multitude of either passive or hostile individ- ual entities to be dominated and exploited.36 The question is whether subject-object consciousness as such ("ordinary consciousness") and the analytical kind of thinking associated with it intrinsically presuppose such an act of detachment from "Reason." The "Essay on Faith" does not directly address this question. There are references to it, but they are ambiguous. It begins with a restatement of the categorical imperative-the universal awareness of law, presupposing a state of estrangement-and clearly states that "consciousness of this fact is the root of all other consciousness.""37 "The commencement of experi- ence," he says, is "an act, in and by which we take upon ourselves an alle- giance, and consequently the obligation of fealty" (italics added).38 Consciousness is a "witness" to the "identity of the will and the reason" that, as the "required proper character of man" (italics added), is the "like- ness or image" of the "identity or coinherence of the absolute will and the reason-[which] is the peculiar character of God."39 According to these statements, conscience apparently testifies to the reality of the Trinitarian God that ought to be, but is not, the structure of the human condition, and this testimony is the root of consciousness. Elsewhere in the same work, however, a different idea seems to be intended: Now when this faculty is employed in the service of the pure reason, it brings out the necessary and universal truths contained in the infinite into distinct contempla- tion by the pure act of the sensuous imagination, that is, in the production of the forms of space and time abstracted from all corporeity, and likewise of the inher- ent forms of the understanding itself abstractedly from the consideration of par- ticulars, as in the case of geometry, numeral mathematics, universal logic, and pure metaphysics.

The editor, James Engell, points out that in this statement Coleridge "has paraphrased and condensed" from Schelling's Abhandlungen zur Erliiuterung des Idealismus (Landshut, 1809). Certainly, nevertheless, it well expresses Coleridge's oft-repeated position and feeling. 36 Shedd, ed., 5:562-63. 37 Ibid., p. 558. 38 Ibid., p. 559. 39 Ibid., p. 561. 40 Ibid., p. 562. 226</page><page sequence="15">Coleridge and the Logos Unfortunately, this statement is conspicuously devoid of the slightest explanation of how such a momentous claim may be justified. It seems, however, to be consistent, in its concept of conscience, with this one from the earlier period: The conscience is ... an experience [Coleridge's italics] (sui generis) of the coinci- dence [italics added] of the human will with reason and religion. It ... is ... best described in the words of our liturgy, as THE PEACE OF GOD THAT PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING.41 Here conscience is spoken of, not in association with law and estrangement, but with the experience of unity and peace. The statement is, I believe, important, but again it is neither preceded nor followed by any effort to show how the forms of intuition, the categories, or mathe- matical principles might proceed from such a condition of unity. Indeed, it would seem that the only plausible, and at best partial, derivation of such universal forms of consciousness from the moral sense must involve their association with the distinction, not the unity, between reason and will. In The Friend several pages are devoted to a discussion of reason in its "more common," but "narrower and derivative sense,"42 as the source of the absolute principles of logic and mathematics. The introduction to this discussion includes the assertion, "Whatever is conscious Self-knowledge is Reason; and in this sense it may be safely defined the organ of the Super- sensuous."43 Earlier in the same work another statement gives the basis for a plausible implicit logic: "All speculative Truths begin with a Postulate, even the Truths of Geometry. They all suppose an act of the Will; for in the moral being lies the source of the intellectual. The first step to knowl- edge, or rather the previous condition of all insight into truth, is to dare commune with our very and permanent self."44 It would help to know in what sense Coleridge intends the expression "commune with" to be understood: as intimate union with, or as dutiful recognition of. Let us assume the latter. On the basis of all that we have thus far seen of Coleridge's language about selfhood, the "very and permanent self" must be the universal pole of human/divine Reason. The use of abstract princi- ples, we may say, depends on the general distinction of the contingent from the universal and necessary. The concept that I suggested is implied in Coleridge's statement is that conscience gives birth to this distinction because it is the awareness of a distinction between an "empirical" or con- tingent self that may think and act in almost any way, and a universal self 41 SM (n. 2 above), pp. 66-67. 42Friend, 1:157. 43Ibid., 1:156. 44Ibid., 1:115. 227</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion that imposes one principle of thought and action as binding under all con- ditions. Logic and mathematics, like faith, involve an "allegiance" to the ultimate, undeniable reality; and Coleridge's idea seems to be that the moral recognition on which faith is based is the source of all recognition of absolute principles. The word "distinction" is crucial in the foregoing explication. Con- sciousness, in the sense of a coherent subject-object awareness, does seem to presuppose a distinction-a split, not a unity-between reason and will, though a split in which the authority of reason is acknowledged. The question remains before us, whether such awareness rests upon a yet deeper, original unity of selfhood. Reason, as conceived by Coleridge, has in common with the Kantian "understanding" that it is a context of unity in which experience occurs. The question is whether Coleridge, in his ear- lier, if not in his later, years, thinks of this larger moral unity (the universal indwelling Logos of love) as the ground of the unity of experience repre- sented by the categories: an antecedent, underlying, or encompassing structure of meaning that contains the categories within itself as a secon- dary level of order. If the Logos is the light "which lighteth every man," and if the Logos is the basis of all consciousness, then is consciousness as such-specifically, the ordinary consciousness of the ordinary human being-at bottom rooted in a love from which it somehow becomes alien- ated? Or is consciousness as such a fall from unity, and the ideal unity of will and reason therefore a condition that appears later, and only occa- sionally, in exceptional persons? Certainly the most explicit descriptions of this ideal mental constitution refer to consciousness in a highly developed or converted state, and these descriptions are the most helpful in showing what his concept of the ideal is. Nowhere is it better stated than in a remarkable Appendix to The Statesman's Manual: The REASON, ... as the integral spirit of the regenerated man, ... ". .. the breath of the power of God, .. ." (Wisdom of Solomon, c. vii.) ... without being either the SENSE, the UNDERSTANDING or the IMAGINATION contains all three within itself, even as the mind contains its thoughts, and is present in and through them all; or as the expression pervades the different features of an intelligent counte- nance..... It can not in strict language be called a faculty, much less a personal property, of any human mind! He, with whom it is present, can as little appropri- ate it, whether totally or by partition, as he can claim ownership in the breathing air or make an inclosure in the cope of heaven.45 His aim in this Appendix is to show that sheer subject-object, analytical consciousness is artificial and incomplete. It is, he says, an "abstraction," 45 SM, pp. 69-70. 228</page><page sequence="17">Coleridge and the Logos even if for certain purposes necessary: "The man of healthful and undi- vided intellect uses his understanding in this state of abstraction only as a tool or organ ... as the means not the end of knowledge."46 The key to "healthful and undivided intellect" is the recognition that all knowledge depends on self-knowledge, "the latent presence of the 'I am.'"'47 Such talk is, of course, derived from the Kantian "transcendental unity of appercep- tion" and from Fichte's and Schelling's development of the concept. Coleridge's idea, however, is not simply derivative. The self-consciousness that he has in mind does not provide simply a "unity of consciousness" but a meaningful unity. Reference to the "I am" leads him at once to God, and for Coleridge, by this point in his life, "God" always means the Trinity, especially when the divine name is associated with the "I am" formula. God is the ultimate and underlying self-consciousness in which subject and object (Father and Son) are an eternal distinctness-in-unity because their relationship is love. "The man of healthful and undivided intellect" is one whose conscious- ness of the world is grounded in a self-consciousness that is enlightened from within by the infinite self-consciousness of the Trinitarian God who is communal love. Such a mind sees the external world, beneath the cor- ruptions produced by an understanding-dominated civilization, as reflec- tive of the divine love or Reason within the self. As with other Romantics, Coleridge's model for the world in its true being is unspoiled nature. In the same Appendix he describes a "flowery meadow" beyond his window.48 window.48 At the beginning of the second paragraph of this section he speaks of "that undivided reason, neither merely speculative or merely practical, but both in one"-a perfect statement of his concept that fully truthful cognition and moral wholeness are inseparable. He continues: "I seem to myself to behold in the quiet objects, on which I am gazing, more than an arbitrary illustration, more than a mere simile, the work of my own fancy. I feel an awe, as if there were before my eyes the same power as that of the reason-the same power in a lower dignity, and therefore a symbol established in the life of things."49 Nature is a "symbol." His characterization of symbols, here and else- where, is a stunning anticipation of twentieth-century definitions by Paul Tillich and others: "by a symbol I mean, not a metaphor or allegory or any other figure of speech or form of fancy, but an actual and essential part of that the whole of which it represents."50 The fact, however, that nature is here spoken of as a "symbol" indicates that Coleridge is assuming a sophis- 46 Ibid., pp. 68-69. 47 Ibid., p. 78. 48 Ibid., p. 71. 49 Ibid., p. 72. 50 Ibid., p. 79. 229</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion ticated (or as he might prefer, "regenerate") awareness of nature rather than ordinary perception, because-as the reference to metaphor and allegory suggest-his concept of symbol was developed as an essential ele- ment of his literary theory. More broadly, a symbol for him is usually thought of as a product of human cultural creativity. Two of the principal aspects of such creativity are religion-in the sense of what we would call "cult," the activities and products of a worshiping community-and art. These two are mentioned briefly, but with very explicit significance and in close relation to one another, in the Appendix to The Statesman's Manual that we are now considering. Reason as such, Coleridge says, "manifests itself in man by the tendency to the comprehension of all as one."5' Taken in itself, as a human faculty, it is the power to apprehend purely universal truth or reality. Understand- ing, on the other hand, is the power to apprehend individual entities. Reli- gion focuses attention on the concrete world of individual things, persons, and actions, but in their relation to universal meanings; it is "the consider- ation of the Particular and Individual (in which respect it takes up and identifies with itself the excellence of the Understanding) but of the Indi- vidual as it exists and has its being in the Universal (in which respect it is one with the pure Reason)." Therefore religion by its nature gives birth to art: "Hence in all ages and countries of civilization Religion has been the parent and fosterer of the Fine Arts, as of Poetry, Music, Painting, &amp; c. the common essence of which consists in a similar union of the Universal and the Individual."52 Religion and art together make possible, in actual cultural existence, the unity of reason and understanding, or the production of symbols, which is true knowledge. Religion explicitly perceives the ultimate unity of all concrete things in God; art is the power actually to represent this unity in such a way that it can be a creative force in cultural life, including the life of religious institutions themselves. Perhaps it is not an overstatement to say that, at least in the period we are now considering and whether or not Coleridge ever stated it or even thought of it, on the basis of his principles, religion and art in their proper functioning are each simply inconceivable without the other. Art is never, for Coleridge, a sub- stitute for religion or equivalent to religion. But it is in its essence reli- gious; more decisive for the purposes of our topic, art is indispensable in a society for the enabling and furtherance of a true-that is, a religious- knowledge of the world. The function of art in relation to Reason can be made more explicit by reference to Coleridge's concept of "imagination." Broadly speaking, 51 Ibid., p. 60. 52 Ibid., p. 62. 230</page><page sequence="19">Coleridge and the Logos imagination for him might be defined as the mind's creative activity in knowing and in reshaping the material of sense experience under the con- ditions of unity with Reason. His own most famous characterization is in the Biographia Literaria (he calls it here the "secondary imagination"): "It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create;... it struggles to ideal- ize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead."53 Imagination "dissolves" the fixed character of objects and their relation to one another, as perceived through the understanding, and creates a new, organic unity distinctive to the specific work of art. Every work of the imagination is thus different from every other and is in this sense subjective. However, art is definitely not for Coleridge essentially subjective because imagination depends on Reason. Even though it "re-creates" nature, in another, even more basic sense it "imitates" nature because nature is in fact not what the understanding per se conceives it to be but the reflection of Reason. Thus all art that deserves the name embodies universal truth because it mediates between Reason within the artist and the world as experienced through the senses and in doing so discloses the essential reality of the world itself. The following statement, in which Coleridge most adequately presents his concept of imagination, also perfectly indicates what he means by "the healthful and undivided intellect": "that reconciling and mediatory power, which incor- porating the Reason in Images of the Sense, and organizing (as it were) the flux of the Senses by the permanence and self-circling energies of the Reason, gives birth to a system of symbols, harmonious in themselves, and consubstantial with the truths, of which they are the conductors."54 III What we have been seeing is that Coleridge certainly does have the idea of consciousness' being rooted in Reason as the indwelling divine love but that he most clearly describes such consciousness as a mature or sophisti- cated condition. To return now to the original question: how does he think that Reason, as indwelling divine love, is related to consciousness simply as ordinary perception of an external world? And how, therefore, does he conceive of the relation between ordinary perception and the poetic consciousness? These questions are directly related to the notorious distinction between "primary" and "secondary" imagination in chapter 13 of the Biographia Literaria. The distinction is stated only once, in a paragraph that constitutes an abortive conclusion to a lengthy disquisition, mostly 53 Biographia (n. 2 above), 1:304. 54 SM (n. 2 above), p. 29. 231</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion taken directly from Schelling, on the active role of the mind in knowl- edge. Coleridge does not pursue the analysis of two kinds or levels of imagination, and the passage has been frustrating to all its students. Many virtually propose ignoring it. But it does not consent to being ignored, and interpretations continue to proliferate. The statement is as follows: The IMAGINATION then I consider either as primary, or secondary. The primary IMAGINATION I hold to be the living Power and prime Agent of all human Per- ception, as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infi- nite I AM. The secondary I consider as an echo of the former, co-existing with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation. It dissolves, diffuses, dis- sipates, in order to re-create; or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still at all events it struggles to idealize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead.55 The meaning of "secondary imagination" is not in dispute. It clearly is artistic creativity, and it has already been referred to. The mystery is the meaning of "primary imagination." Most interpretations that relate pri- mary imagination to ordinary perception tend to ignore the theological reference ("a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM") and equate ordinary perception with understanding, whereas those that take seriously the theological reference tend in one way or another to detach it from ordinary perception. A summary of some important interpretations may be helpful in setting the context. The most influential discussion has been that of Shawcross in 1907, who says that "evidently" primary imagination is the power in universal con- sciousness of "detaching the world of experience from the self and con- templating it in its detachment.... The ordinary consciousness, with no principle of unification, sees the universe as a mass of particulars."56 In what is by far the most famous book written on Coleridge's theory of imagination, I. A. Richards repeats but sharpens Shawcross' theory: "The Primary Imagination is normal perception that produces the usual world of the senses, That inanimate cold world allowed To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd, the world of motor-buses, beef-steaks, and acquaintances, the framework of things and events within which we maintain our everyday existence, the world of the routine satisfaction of our minimum exigencies."''57 By includ- ing Coleridge's words from "Dejection: An Ode," Richards goes beyond 55 Biographia, 1:304. 56 Shawcross (n. 27 above), pp. lxvii-lxviii. 57 I. A. Richards, Coleridge on Imagination (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1935), p. 58. 232</page><page sequence="21">Coleridge and the Logos Shawcross (and beyond Coleridge) to attach a negative value judgment to the "framework of ... everyday existence"; it is the state described by Coleridge when the understanding becomes the constitutive mode of awareness: "cold," "loveless," "ever-anxious." D. G. James, writing shortly after the publication of Richards's book, devotes a major portion of his own book to a criticism of Richards; nevertheless, he too assumes that what is created by the primary imagination is a world of "selfish solici- tude," which Coleridge certainly does not say.58 It would mean that human beings are evil in their very essence. These three interpretations have in common that in them no role whatever is played by Coleridge's assertion that primary imagination is the "repetition" of the divine cre- ation (though Shawcross and James have great respect for the theological character of Coleridge's thought). One of the most learned and authoritative present-day writers on Coleridge is James Engell. Engell's book, The Creative Imagination, traces the history of the concept of imagination in English and German litera- ture and philosophy from the seventeenth century to what he considers its consummation in Coleridge. Engell is fully aware of the connection in Coleridge's mind between human consciousness and divine creativity. Even so, he does not really explain this connection. He speaks of "Cole- ridge's sense of 'primary imagination' as an individual repetition or per- ceptive duplication of the universe as created by the infinite 'I am,'" but when, several pages later, he describes the primary imagination more spe- cifically as "common to all people," he says nothing about how divine activity is operative or "repeated. 59 He further discusses the concept in his "Introduction" to the Bollingen Series edition of the Biographia, of which he and Walter Jackson Bate are editors. Here Engell comes closer to the interpretation in this essay. The "exclusivity" of secondary, or artis- tic, imagination, says Engell, "bothered Coleridge, who asserts a broader moral sense of the heart capable of leading all individuals to a higher spiri- tual life and salvation."60 Poetic imagination, as "the fullest exercise of the self and of its inner powers," is an extension of this "broader moral sense" possessed by everyone. Engell refers to Coleridge's own observation in the Biographia: "All the organs of spirit are framed for a correspondent world of spirit; tho' the latter organs are not developed in all alike. But they exist in all, and their first appearance discloses itself in the moral being."6' How- 58 D. G.

The expression "selfish solicitude" is Coleridge's, but what he speaks of is a 'film of familiarity and selfish solicitude" (italics added)-i.e., it would seem, something added to the qriginal image (see Biographia, chap. 14, cited by James). 59 Engell, The Creative Imagination (n. 20 above), pp. 340; 344. 60 Biographia, 1:xc. 61 Ibid., 1:242. 233</page><page sequence="22">The Journal of Religion ever, in stating what he thinks the primary imagination actually means, he could as well have left God out, as indeed he virtually does. He gives an essentially Kantian picture of the "synthetic power" of the mind construct- ing from "sense images ... an intelligible view of the world" and describes this as "a comprehension of the creation of God.'"62 What is of greater inter- est to Engell is the idea that primary imagination involves the unconscious assimilation of one's cultural heritage-that which has been created by the secondary imagination of others. Such assimilation is assuredly of the greatest importance to Coleridge, but to say, as Engell does, that this is the "repetition" Coleridge has in mind is simply to depart from the text alto- gether.63 Engell is rather harshly-I think too harshly-criticized by Jonathan Wordsworth. Wordsworth focuses attention on what I too think has been the almost universal defect in analyses of this famous passage: the appar- ent reluctance to take Coleridge at his word when he relates primary imagination directly and emphatically to the experience of a transcendent reality. Wordsworth is one of several scholars who have been influenced by a deservedly famous essay of W. J. Bate. Bate argues that "primary" in this instance means not simply first in time or simply the precondition of secondary imagination (Engell uses the analogy of "primary" and "secon- dary" education) but, rather, of primary importance.64 Wordsworth is very stimulating in calling attention to the adjectives in Coleridge's sen- tence: "Stress in both halves falls on the adjectives. Those in the first could hardly be more positive: 'living Power,' 'prime Agent,' 'all human Perception'; while in the second there is an escalation, 'finite'- 'eternal'-'infinite', that speaks for itself. Whatever its purpose, the prose exultantly proclaims an incarnation of the eternal in time, a personal reenactment of God's original, and endlessly continuous, moment of self- naming.'"65 Moreover, Wordsworth carefully relates the Trinitarian con- cept to the "infinite I AM": "God in his self-naming-I AM-creates himself as both subject and object."66 It turns out, however, that Wordsworth has in mind a religious awareness that is "primary" indeed in significance but further removed from ordinary perception than even the secondary imagination is.67 Indeed, he posits two primary imaginations, 62 Engell, in his introduction to ibid., p. lxxxix (italics added). 63 Ibid., p. xci. 64 Walter Jackson Bate, "Coleridge on the Function of Art," in Perspectives of Criticism, ed. Harry Levin (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1950), pp. 125-29. Bate takes Coleridge's Platonism as the key; he thinks that primary imagination is the mind's power to grasp universal, supersensuous realities, and secondary imagination the power to apply them to sense data and create symbols, or art. 65 Wordsworth (n. 20 above), p. 24. 66 Ibid., p. 43. 67 Leslie Brisman, too, interprets primary imagination as an explicitly, consciously religious 234</page><page sequence="23">Coleridge and the Logos or two "powers" of the one. The lower power orders sense experience in the commonly understood Kantian sense, but the higher power "is the supreme achievement of oneness with God," beyond secondary imagina- tion or art.68 This general concept is arguably present in Coleridge's thought, but as an explanation of the passage in question the interpreta- tion can only be called eccentric; it begins with a penetrating analysis of the text and ends by ignoring it. To me it seems clear that the most reasonable explanation-one that takes seriously exactly what the words say and not only is consistent with but also sheds light on a large complex of Coleridge's important state- ments-takes as the all-important consideration Coleridge's association of "the eternal act of creation" with "all human Perception" (italics added). For Coleridge, the "infinite I AM" must be the Christian Trinitarian God. It is the act of self-affirmation in which subject and object are eternally dis- tinct and yet eternally united in love. The essential character of such love is creativity. This self-affirmation or self-positing is causa sui in the specific sense that, because it is love, it produces itself as its own other; it is the eter- nal self-generation of I-Thou reciprocity. It makes perfectly good sense, and is perfectly consistent with the basic ideas we have examined, for Coleridge as a Johannine-Christian Kantian to speak of ordinary human perception as a "repetition" of this "eternal act of creation." The human mind, being finite self-consciousness, is the image of God; in its healthy functioning, it lives, moves, and has its being in the divine creative love. Its normal function or essential nature is to perceive the world in the light of the divine love and as being the embodiment of love-as Coleridge thinks the poet does. In this way ordinary perception is creative, not in that it produces a world that is different from the real world, but that it knows the world as it really is by a vital activity corresponding to the vitality of the external world. As the mind comes to consciousness, it actively, crea- tively, meets the world in the subject-object reciprocity that is the mind's own structure as the image of the God who is love. In this way, the integra- tion of the understanding within the meaningful framework of Reason, of which Coleridge often speaks, is the essential structure of human percep- tion as such. By this interpretation, it is natural for Coleridge to say that secondary imagination, that of the artistic genius, is "identical with the pri- mary in the kind of its agency, ... differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation." On the other hand, intriguing as this formulation is, the question must not be ignored: why did Coleridge not develop it, either in the Biographia experience beyond ordinary perception and beyond art (Brisman, "Coleridge and the Supernat- ural," Studies in Romanticism 21 [Summer 1982]: 125-27). 68 Wordsworth, pp. 47-50. 235</page><page sequence="24">The Journal of Religion or in later writings? He clearly seems to have drawn back very quickly from such an explicit assertion, and there is the tantalizing statement of his daughter that in one copy of the Biographia he "stroked out" the cru- cial clause, "and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of cre- ation in the infinite I AM."69 No one knows the answer for sure, but certain conjectures, consistent with the argument of this essay, are reasonable. There is, for instance, Coleridge's revulsion from Schellingian pantheism. In actuality, the state- ment, especially if taken in the context of Coleridge's theology generally, fully presupposes God's transcendence as well as immanence. Still, to him in his time and place, the language may have seemed to suggest something too nearly approaching an identification of divine and human creativity in the act of knowledge. More basic, from the standpoint of the present dis- cussion, is that the statement may have seemed to him to suggest an ideali- zation of everyday perception that he always vehemently opposed for two reasons. In the first place, he was always realistic, to understate the matter, about the sinfulness of most human interaction with the world. As actually experinced, ordinary consciousness is virtually identical with the detached "understanding," not reflective of a divine unity. In the second place, as appears most dramatically in his disagreement with Wordsworth, he denied that the speech and general culture of uneducated people, living "close to nature," are any model for poetry or the development of a healthy society. In practice, the mind must be either converted or devel- oped, or both, for it effectually to reflect the indwelling "infinite I AM." There is, therefore, an ambiguity, or insufficiently analyzed tension, in Coleridge's thinking at this crucial point. A couple of important illustra- tions may help, not only to emphasize the ambiguity, but also to produce a convincing suggestion regarding his actual position. Reference has already been made to a famous passage in The Statesman's Manual, where he speaks of nature as revealing "the same power as that of reason." The passage begins by comparing nature to "a beautiful infant that has fed itself asleep at its mother's bosom, and smiles in its strange dream of obscure yet happy sensations."70 He continues: "It seems as if the soul said to herself: 'From this state hast thou fallen!'" But the infant is asleep, not exercising reason. Therefore comes the decisive assertion: "But what the plant is by an act not its own and unconsciously-that must thou make thyself to become! must by prayer and by a watchful and unresisting spirit, join at least with the preventive and assisting grace to make thyself, in that light of conscience which inflameth not, and with that knowledge which puffeth not up." Reason is indeed somehow related to 69 Biographia (n. 2 above), 1:304, n. 3. 70 SM (n. 2 above), p. 71. 236</page><page sequence="25">Coleridge and the Logos the preconscious unity of nature or the condition of the newborn infant; in human beings this unity has been broken by a fall of some kind; never- theless the answer is not a return to a simpler condition. The other passage is one of Coleridge's most remarkable, from The Friend.7' It challenges the reader to consider the sheer fact that anything at all exists and that the idea of there being nothing is "self-contradictory." To become actually aware of existence as such is, he says, to experience the power of an infinite whole to which one belongs: "It is absolutely one, and that it Is, and affirms itself TO BE, is its only predicate. ... And he for whom it manifests itself in its adequate idea, dare as little arrogate it to himself as his own, can as little appropriate it either totally or by partition, as he can claim ownership in the breathing air, or make an enclosure in the cope of heaven."" This, of course, is the way Coleridge characteristi- cally speaks of Reason, and indeed in this passage the "power" of sheer "Being" that he is describing is Reason: "The ground-work, therefore, of all true philosophy is the full apprehension of the difference between the contemplation of reason, namely, that intuition of things which arises when we possess ourselves, as one with the whole, which is substantial knowledge, and that which presents itself when ... we think of ourselves as separated beings, and place nature in antithesis to the mind, as object to subject, thing to thought, death to life."73 Indeed, it is the Trinity: "an eternal and infinite self-rejoicing, self-loving."74 Our question is, Who does or may possess this kind of knowledge, "the only knowledge that truly is" because it is the experience of being?75 It seems absolutely funda- mental and universal, the basis of all other knowledge. Coleridge's implied response is either ambiguous or two-sided: "This alone belongs to and speaks intelligibly to all alike, the learned and the ignorant, if but the heart listens. For alike present in all, it may be awakened, but it cannot be given.'"76 Somehow, then, such awareness is present to anyone who is aware of being in a world at all. On the other hand, it must be "awak- ened," and the real theme of this rather extended passage is the true char- acter of the most sophisticated forms of knowledge-philosophy and science. However, we now are in the position to see more exactly Coleridge's underlying concept, never fully articulated but clearly enough implied. It is a developmental concept, indicated in a statement from the Biographia already cited: "All the organs of spirit are framed for a correspondent 71 Friend (n. 2 above), 1:514-24. 72 Ibid., 1:515. 73Ibid., 1:520. 74 Ibid., 1:521. 75 Ibid., 1:524. 76 Ibid. 237</page><page sequence="26">The Journal of Religion world of spirit: tho' the latter organs are not developed in all alike. But they exist in all, and their first appearance discloses itself in the moral being."" The essential structure of human consciousness is that of the Trinity, the perfect distinctness-in-unity of subject and object. As far as human nature is concerned, there is no reason that consciousness might not develop without sin: the self in harmony with its environment, the emerging understanding irradiated by, and the developing will in a state of joyful allegiance to Reason. Since humanity is in the image of the Trinity, the distinction of subject and object requires no state of alienation. A metaphor used in Martin Buber's I and Thou may be helpful in eluci- dating Coleridge's concept as I understand it.78 The metaphor has an obvi- ous Kantian provenance that makes it especially useful in speaking of Coleridge, although Buber's idea itself is quite un-Kantian. Buber wants to show that the I-You modality is essential to human being and, therefore, that in some sense it is the structure of awareness from the very beginning of our lives, even though newborn infants do not in fact confront anything around them as a You. What is present from the beginning, he says, is a "readiness," and he uses the image of a "cupped hand" to suggest the basic structure or "shape" ("category" and "a priori of relation" he in fact calls it) that is in place from the beginning, before the explicit manifestation that comes with the development of the organism. Coleridge, I suggest, thinks in terms of two "cupped hands," a smaller within a larger: the categories of the understanding, as described by Kant, within the larger "category" of the divine love or union of will and reason that later is experienced as the Logos-or by extension, the Trinity itself.79 From the standpoint of such a conception, there is indeed a great differ- ence between the "secondary imagination" of the exceptionally gifted and/or regenerate person and the "primary imagination," or ordinary consciousness. But there also is a direct continuity, whereby the two "dif- fer only in degree and in the mode of... operation," as long as primary imagination is understood to mean ordinary consciousness in its uncorrupted state. The concept of "primary imagination," even though it is used only once by Coleridge, is still very valuable as indicating an idea essential for him: that the ideal condition of the mind, its fulfilled state, is 77 Biographia, 1:242. 78 Martin Buber, I and Thou (New York: Scribner's, 1970), p. 78. McFarland (n. 20 above) also suggests an affinity between Buber's and Coleridge's ways of thinking, but the references are dif- ferent (pp. 236-39). 79 Engell has a similar concept: "Just as understanding includes and subsumes the senses, so reason includes and subsumes understanding. The image of the various faculties is one of concen- tric circles, each larger one including lesser ones within it" (The Creative Imagination [n. 20 above], p. 337). He does not, however, use the idea to suggest a universal structure that is the matrix of consciousness as such. 238</page><page sequence="27">Coleridge and the Logos also its original, essential structure, the precondition of all conscious knowledge of the world, and that what is generally assumed to be "ordi- nary consciousness" is in fact a distortion or malfunctioning. This brings us back to the original proposition: that for Coleridge the whole enterprise of culture-in Richards's words, "not only poetry ... but every aspect of the routine world in which it is invested with other val- ues than these necessary for our bare continuance as living beings: all objects for which we can feel love, awe, admiration; ... every awareness for which a civilized life is preferred by us to an uncivilized"80 -depends for its success on the actualization of a transcendent reason or love that is always already immanent within the entire human community as the basis of consciousness itself, "the light which lighteth every man." The proposi- tion is given its most concrete application in Coleridge's last published work, On the Constitution of Church and State, in which he deals with the "idea" of the state. An idea, as the term is used in this work, is the indwelling "ultimate aim" or "vital principle" or "truth-power" of any being.81 A note of 1827, included in the 1839 edition of The Statesman's Manual, asserts the essential identity of ideas and reason: "as constituents of reason we necessarily contemplate unity and distinctity. Now the latter as the polar opposite to the former implies plurality: therefore I use the plural, distinctities, and say, that the distinctities considered apart from the unity are the ideas, and reason is the ground and source of ideas."s2 In a notebook entry of 1830, the idea of the state is associated with the divine Logos itself: "The word, as the begotten Word, is the personal Idea of God, the One in the Many-the State the impersonated Idea of Man as Man-the Many as one."83 The state, therefore, as "the impersonated Idea of Man as Man" is intended to cultivate the "latent man in all the natives of the soil,"84 and this is a religious task because the "latent man" is the Logos itself-"the One in the Many." In this context may be understood the statement that is crucial for our purposes: "this knowledge, or sense, may very well exist, aye, and powerfully influence a man's thoughts and actions, without his being distinctly conscious of the same, much more without his being com- petent to express it in definite words. .... [It] is the privilege of the few to possess an idea: of the generality of men, it might be more truly affirmed, that they are possessed by it."85 80 Richards (n. 56 above), pp. 58-59. 81 On the Constitution of Church and State, in Collected Works (n. 2 above), no. 10, ed. John Colmer, 1976), pp. 12, 20. 82 SM, p. 68, n. 3. 85 Coleridge, notebook, 1830, British Library, Additional MS 47539, fol. 65. 84 On the Constitution of Church and State, pp. 47-48. 85 Ibid., pp. 12-13. 239</page><page sequence="28">The Journal of Religion The ideal is for the "idea" to become a conscious "possession," and when this happens all that Coleridge earlier has said about (secondary) imagina- tion is operative, even though he no longer thinks in such terms. But the masses of people, through (primary) imagination, are "possessed by" the same idea, even if in an undeveloped or corrupted fashion. And, although Coleridge does not explicitly say so, I think the implication is clear that there is a two-way indebtedness. The "few" could not "possess" the idea if the "many" were not "possessed by" it. The masses of ordinary people depend on the exceptional few-either the artists or the saints or the scholarly stewards of civilization's treasure, or all three-for the develop- ment and conversion that are required for the realization of their full humanity. But the imaginative or inspired utterance of the few is the actu- alization of a truth that is latent precisely in the ordinariness of the whole body of humankind and does not come to realization without rootedness in this common soil. In the final analysis, perhaps it is in Coleridge's social thought that the meaning of his aesthetic and theological assertions is most adequately clarified. 240</page></plain_text>
