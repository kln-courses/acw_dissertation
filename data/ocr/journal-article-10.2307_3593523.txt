<plain_text><page sequence="1">LINDA KINTZ Performing Virtual Whiteness: The Psychic Fantasy of Globalization N THE GLOBAL EXPANSION of cyberspace, the complex mixture of high technology and U.S. cultural politics has made white supremacy paradoxically both more powerful and more invisible. As Toni Morrison argues, "Race has assumed a metaphorical life so completely embedded in daily discourse that it is perhaps more necessary and more on display than ever before" (63). This is due in part to a rhetorical and performative collapse between two definitions of the individual: the common man and the entrepreneurial corporation as person. The result has been a visible invisibility, in which supremacy achieves its ends by making an almost literal equation between two things that would initially seem to be unrelated: the need for deregulation in the marketplace and the need for meritocracy in the culture at large, with both firmly anchored in a narrow inter- pretation of God's natural law, drawing on a passionate reservoir of emotional and spiritual resources. To explain how this works, one could find no better guide than the cyberspace guru, George Gilder, who joins neoconservative political economy to a theocratic belief in natural law in a message reinforced by other highly visible conservative media celebrities. I. George Gilder Though in the world of neoconservatism, technology, and high finance, Gilder's every word makes waves, he is relatively unknown to a wider public not avidly following their investments in technology stocks. If you've heard of him at all outside that context, it is probably only as the author of a remarkably regressive sociology that draws on sociobiology to assert the natural, intrinsic nature of gen- der and racial hierarchies.' Gilder's technological pronouncements, however, at least prior to the crash of 2001, produced something called the Gilder-effect, "a form of momentum madness that overcomes a stock after it's endorsed in the Gilder 1 In Men and Marriage, originally titled, Sexual Suicide, Gilder argues that, because in their primal state men are naturally warriors and women are naturally mothers, civilization exacts the greatest sacrifice from men, who have had to give up their true natures. As a result, society must reconstruct male primacy, which is natural and God-given, and therefore not discriminatory. Here are a few representative passages:</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /334 Technology Report" and increases the stock's value by 20-60% (Barbash HO 1). The Report once boasted 65,000 online subscribers at $295 per subscription; subscribers also organized meetings around the country at which Gilder occasionally showed up, "though he never promise [d] to in advance, for fear of unmanageable crowds" (MacFarquhar 111). In addition, Gilder's 1981 book, Wealth and Poverty, inspired supply-side economics in the Reagan era, and in 1993 he contributed a chapter to Renewing American Civilization, the college course developed for the Progress and Freedom Foundation by Newt Gingrich. Out of this course came the Con- tract with America that propelled the conservative takeover of the House of Rep- resentatives in 1994 and helped set the rhetorical parameters for contemporary governmental policies, whose "center" has been moved very far to the right. Al- though those on the right complain that the center has moved left, they can do so only because the public sphere has been so thoroughly redefined in opposi- tion to privatization that advocates of a role for the public sphere are now re- ferred to as socialists. Gilder is also a founder of the Discovery Institute, a think tank in Seattle whose participating fellows engage in dialogue in the form of conferences, debates, books, articles, congressional testimony, and a website through which it engages members of the public, public officials, business people, academics, and the me- dia. Furthermore, Gilder Publishing has just purchased one of the major conser- vative journals, The American Spectator. Gilder is described in a profile in Communications Week International as "the voice of unbridled optimism for telecoms progress, backed by deep intellectual rigor" (Cukier). As I hope to show, such a statement reveals with stark clarity the stakes in contemporary U.S. politics: the very redefinition of intellectual rigor and democracy, as conservatism joins an anachronistic nineteenth-century cosmology and a belief in absolutism to the postmodern digitalized economy. If one has been following Gilder's career closely, it is easy to see how he brings together overtly regressive theocratic moralism and abstract, breathless theories of digitalized imperialism. However, Gilder's reactionary social positions have often been overlooked or misunderstood by the left, or they have elicited only a sigh of embarrassment from his techie admirers, who boast of their own open- minded, libertarian tolerance, which they separate from his stock tips and techno- logical advice. What I want to do here, however, is to follow the suggestion of Richard Dyer and to make strange the whiteness of Gilder's discourse so that it will be easier to see how crucial that frame is to linking the two seemingly uncon- nected aspects of Gilder's thinking: neoconservative political economy of the free Greed is actually less a characteristic of Bill Gates ... than of Harry Homeless. Harry may seem pitiable. But he and his advocates insist that he occupy-and devalue-some of the planet's most valuable real estate. From the beaches of Santa Monica to the center of Manhattan, he wants to live better than most of the population of the world throughout human history but he does not want to give back anything whatsoever to the society that sustains him. He wants ut- terly unearned wealth.

[Poor women] are on welfare in the first place because they would or could not get jobs that remotely compete with welfare benefits.

Here the discourse of digitalized capital is enmeshed, in visibly invisible ways, in the highly abstracted, anachronistic fantasy of Christian white supremacy, founded, of course, on heterosexual male supremacy. Tracing this will benefit from a look at the increasing influence of what W.J. Cash, in 1941, called "the mind of the South" since Southerners have come to occupy the highest reaches of contemporary U.S. politics. Questions will also have to be asked about the historicity of particular forms of technology. What specific, historical type of psychic fantasy produces Gilder's theories of the technologies of cyberspace? What features of this technology then reproduce that very fantasy in the material conditions of postmodernity? (Discourse alone, of course, doesn't make change. Note the influence of right-wing funding of think tanks on the institutions and policies of government?) In a book entitled Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology, Gilder argued that the digital revolution caused the old capitalist economies of scale to "collapse" into a microcosm, an information economy in which small is better and individual liberty has been immeasurably enhanced. More recently, 2 Conservative influence has been greatly expanded by think tanks such as the American Enter- prise Institute, the Cato Institute, and the Heritage Foundation; Heritage conducted the initiation for freshmen GOP Congresspeople elected in 1994. Also important has been Richard Mellon Scaife, a billionaire philanthropist who, after Goldwater's defeat in 1964, began funding the modern conservative movement, giving $1.4 billion to conserva- tive causes, including activist think tanks that provided financial support for William Bennett, Dinesh D'Souza, Charles Murray, and others. More recently Scaife contributed millions of dollars to "the Arkansas Project" to impeach Bill Clinton. Other recipients: the Independent Women's Forum, the Landmark Legal Foundation, Judicial Watch (and Larry Klayman), as well as conservative college and daily newspapers across the country.

In his view, fiberoptics will make bandwidth (the way one gets access to the Internet) virtually free, and it will elimi- nate the need to exploit human labor and natural resources because the human mind has now become the primary natural resource. Here, however, the concept of the "virtually free" needs to be unpacked, for it resonates on a number of levels, in particular in relation to the reinstitution of the Southern institution of paternalism, the denial of race and class hierarchies while fundamentally depending on them, and the condemnation of collective action through a libertarian deconstruction of the public sphere. To establish this framework, I begin first with the last of these characteristics, the decon- struction of the public sphere and the accompanying redefinition of democracy. Gilder's chief target here, as in all his work, is familiar from the history of U.S. anti-communism. It is "the materialist superstition' which he reductively attributes to Darwin, Freud, and especially Marx-the belief that matter is determinate over mind. He is interested, as Larissa MacFarquhar wrote in a portrait in The New Yorker, in "the poetics of communications technology itself: by the magical intricacies of its circuits and fibres, and even more, by the way in which, in its most enchanted, wireless moments, it seems to evade materiality altogether" (104). MacFarquhar's profile exhibits mainstreamjournalism's characteristic response to Gilder, who is typically portrayed as sweet, brilliant, eccentric, if a bit nutty, and ultimately influential only in the realm of digital innovation. What drops out is his revealing explanation of the way reactionary cultural politics provide a spiritual passion that reinforces free-market theories. In this abstract concept of technology, Gilder legitimates a powerful, if remarkably duplicitous,justification for libertarian depoliticization, as he presents the fundamental requirement for the success of cyberspace: "demassification." This means that only unregulated, autonomous, "individual" choices can produce and be produced by this technol- ogy. In doing so he lays out a rigid binary opposition in which all that will remain after demassification will be his version of free-market capitalism. In this extremely clear, passionate political message, complexity only gets in the way. Gilder's work is a sustained attempt to redefine capitalism, or business, not only in opposition to the left but also to those on the right who too narrowly follow Adam Smith in thinking of capitalism only in terms of self-interest. While many of his critics on the left imagine businessmen in terms of the movie Wall Street, in Gilder's view businessmen are not motivated by greed but by altruism, which he sees as the very essence of capitalism. This moral claim has profound implications for the cultural power of neoconservatism. Capitalism, says Gilder, involves taking risks whose guarantee is faith "in one's neighbors, in one's soci- ety, and in the compensatory logic of the cosmos. Search and you shall find, give and you will be given unto, supply creates its own demand" ("The Moral Sources" 3). For him, the logics of statism and Marxism "rule out the awesome uncertain- ties and commensurate acts of faith that are indispensable to an expanding and innovative system" And while Marxism and statism rest on "the treasure of things' capitalism "is based on the treasure of ideas and spirit ... the foundation of wealth is always giving, not taking. The deepest truth of capitalism is faith, hope and</page><page sequence="5">PERFORMING VIRTUAL WHITENESS/337 love" Having now completely reversed the common view of greed and altruism, he expands the appellation of Monster from the Soviet Union to Big Govern- ment: "Capitalism is the opposite of greed. Greed is the desire for unearned benefits. Greed is a refusal to serve others. Greed leads to demands on govern- ment to give unearned goods. Greed leads to an ever expanding welfare state. It leads to socialism." Through this reconstruction of the corporation as actor or agent and the per- sonalization of capital, Gilder has, on the one hand, deconstructed everyjustifi- cation for collective action, such as union organizing or solidarity (which he links with statism); on the other, he has carefully legitimated the entrepreneurial activities of corporations and the influence of traditional religion, moving both into the void left by the public sphere. Individualism nows refer to entrepreneurial individualism, which demands a perfect performative value system, creating it- self anew at every moment, expressing in every act the inherent breathless risk of the entrepreneurial creation of wealth. Any institution must be eliminated, he insists, "that believes its future is best served by preserving the past" ("Cyber- space and the American Dream"). Gilder argues that early thinkers about artificial intelligence were handicapped by a radical belief in materialism in the same way as were political thinkers and philosophers. But for him the digital revolution revealed precisely the reverse: "For the central fact of the twentieth century is not the overthrow of mind but the overthrow of matter" ("The Materialist Superstition"). He continues: "To com- prehend nature, we have to stop thinking of the world as basically material and begin imagining it as a manifestation of consciousness, suffused with sparks of informative energy," so that we can understand this central fact: "Modern man is injecting the universe with the germ of his intelligence, the spore of his mind." In his view, the fact that nature is mind was decisively proven by quantum phys- ics: "the paradoxical duality of wave-particles [has] come to exclude all material- ist logic; quantum physics does not make materialist sense" That paradoxical duality does make sense, he argues, if it is treated as "a domain of ideas" because paradox itself, as he sees it, cannot be a property of matter, only a property of mind. The fact that we find paradox to be the very basis of the wave/particle relation is proof that mind is the basic ground of matter. And because mind is never the same thing as the physical brain, it is a simple, logical move for him to conclude that digitalized information (untainted by any discussion of commodi- fication or dialectics) thereby constitutes the "rich domain of information at the foundation of matter." Teresa Brennan's important sociopsychoanalytic study of the technologies and politics of globalization, History After Lacan, helps link this thoroughly abstracted fantasy of technology's development, separated from any consideration of its material conditions, labor, or nature, to the Oedipal fantasy of heterosexuality and family values; she calls this the foundational fantasy of contemporary cul- ture.Just as important, she historicizes the Oedipal fantasy in relation toJacques Lacan's theory of the mirror stage, in which he characterized the development of the subject, or ego, as "symbolized in dreams by a fortress, or a stadium-its</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /338 inner arena and enclosure surrounded by marshes and rubbish-tips."3 This fortressing, he argued, dates from a difficult moment in the process of the indi- vidual ego's development, when it must achieve coherence in relation to the social system; this is the moment of "the deflection of the specular I into the social I"4 That is, the child has to negotiate a very difficult trajectory between two stages: a) the binary relation to the mother or caregiver in the Mirror Stage (I/ you), and b) the complicated requirements of society at large, or the Symbolic contract (the larger group of "we"). The result of Western society's demands for strict identity boundaries, while at the same time increasing the impossibility of enforcing such boundaries, was diagnosed by Lacan as "paranoic alienation." In this structure, one is alienated from nature and one's own body, yet when nature and body inevitably make themselves felt, the fear of such feelings, which suggest that one is not in total control, is projected outward onto other people who come to signify threat: women, people of color, those who work and get sweaty or dirty, gays and lesbians, for example. Brennan historicizes that process, arguing that this fortressed ego is specific to the Western capitalist subject of a particular era, its activities of conquest resting on the denial of its own materiality and, of equal importance, its recognition (or misrecognition) of its identity in a visual culture. The Oedipal subject of the mirror stage is thus not a universal subject but a historical one in which [t]he subject is founded by a hallucinatory fantasy in which it conceives itself as the locus of active agency and the environment as passive; its subjectivity is secured by a projection onto the environ- ment, apparently beginning with the mother, which makes her into an object which the subject in fantasy controls. To the extent that the fantasy dominates the subject's psyche, knowledge or experi- ence of energetic connections between beings and entities is foreclosed. (11) And not only is that familiar Oedipal fantasy easy to identify in theories like Gilder's, but Brennan argues that this kind of conceptualization produces a form of technology (or, more precisely, a specific use of that technology) that is itself capable of fulfilling the desires embodied in the foundational fantasy. That tech- nology thus represents a dialectical acting out of the foundational fantasy "on an increasingly global scale, an enactment that reinforces the psychical power of the fantasy" (Brennan 13). In other words, as Gilder's writings show, that tech- nology is capable of being used to increase the dominating impulses of a certain kind of ego. In his exemplary performance of the foundational fantasy, Gilder goes on to make a profoundly reductive, dangerous claim for the abstract paradox he has located: 3 "Correlativement la formation du je symbolise oniriquement par un camp retranche, voire un stade,-distribuant de l'arene interieure a son enceinte, a son pourtour de gravats et de marecages, deux champs de lutte opposes oiu le sujet s'empetre dans la quete de l'altier et lointain chateau interieur, dont la forme (parfois juxtaposee dans le meme scenario) symbolise le fa de facon saisissante. Et de meme, ici sur le plan mental, trouvons-nous realisees ces structures d'ouvrage fortifie dont la metaphore surgit spontanement, et comme issue des sympt6mes eux-memes du sujet, pour designer les mecanismes d'inversion, d'isolation, de reduplication,, d'annulation, de deplacement, de la nevrose obsessionnelle" (Ecrits 97-98). 4 Ego formation prior to the entry into language and the social does not escape the effects of the social system, including the effects of social class on child-rearing, gender training, the mental health of parents, etc., as well as biological factors.</page><page sequence="7">PERFORMING VIRTUAL WHITENESS/339 Thus the fundamental entity in quantum theory is a cross, a cross between a wave, which is infinite in extent, propagating infinitely through its surrounding medium, and a particle, a point of no extent. All the universe is based on these crosses of waves and particles which are utterly paradoxi- cal, but which deeply accord with the fundamental paradoxes of the Christian religion: the Word made flesh, the God-Man, the eternal and the temporal, the infinite and the particular. In place of what had been an inert, blind bit of matter at the foundations of the universe, we find a cross. ("The Materialist Superstition") Here at the very core of matter, truth, and science, Gilder finds cosmic Chris- tianity in a remarkably narrow form, as he equates entrepreneurial risk with a religious act of faith and finds traditional morality in the very fundament of the free-market cosmos; choice is again reconfigured: "[Digital] networks promote choice, choice enhances quality and quality favors morality... a culture of first choices creates a bias toward excellence and virtue" ("Angst and Awe"). Gilder's earlier advice to eliminate institutions that seek to preserve the past can now be understood. Because in this version of "intellectual rigor" the cosmos is found to be an expression of God's design, traditional religion can now be said to lie out- side the realm of history and to constitute objective reality. Capitalism (and this is capitalism of a very particular model; there are obvi- ously many other versions, and critics of corporate free market capitalism would be well advised to complicate their notions of capitalism by a consideration of the role of small business) thus becomes the fulfillment of Christ's mission on earth: "Now sweeping through the global economy, the overthrow of matter will unleash an undertow of religious belief that will make the new millennium a time of awakening to the oceanic grandeur and goodness of the universe. An economy of ideas and innovations ultimately means an economy ruled by spirit and faith" ("The Faith of a Futurist"). Through this activity, man proves that he has been created in God's image: Giving up the superficial comforts of a human scale world, man moves to mindscale. In the image of his Creator, he exalts the truly human-and godlike-dimension of his greatest gift: his creativity. Giving up the material idols in his ken, he is gaining at last his promised dominion over the world and its creatures." ("The Materialist Superstition") In this religious romance, the left's bias toward redistribution can now be called a religious disorder and, in effect, an attack on Christian natural law.5 This highly influential work, saturated as it is in overtly reactionary, ethnocen- tric conservatism and the imperial Western Oedipus, can be best understood by following what Richard Dyer calls the matter or cultural register of whiteness, the specificity of white representation that "does not reside in a set of stereotypes so much as in narrative structural positions, rhetorical tropes and habits of per- ceiving" (12). In this "racial imagery of white people,' what is especially white is 5 Tom Bethell writes: "Belief in God, [Gilder] says, 'is a belief in powerful good. It's a belief that goodness does prevail.' Materialism 'ends up in the belief that evil prevails; because all it yields are 'arrangements of atoms' which will forever be meaningless. 'If nothing has meaning, then the most ruthless and predatory forces will win' The implacable Christian logic here accommodates manyJewish conservatives, though tensions remain. Arguments about the Second Coming and the role of Israel in the Apocalyptic narrative help explain a strong pro-Israel position among many evangelicals and fundamentalists. Others find neoconservative positions on moral issues compatible. &lt;http://www.spectator.org/archives&gt;.</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /340 the "non-located and disembodied position of knowledge" (Dyer 4). But this is paradoxically a disembodied embodiment. The claim to embodiment, as Dyer ar- gues, also serves as a marker of whiteness and its privilege, which arises out of the Christian story of a God who became man, revalorizing, while transcending, the human body and saving it from mortality. Thus the white subject here is a being who is in the body but not of it, a human subject standing for universality; the white person represents an infinitely generalizable "being without properties in a visual culture."6 This means that though the white body is privileged in a visual culture, white- ness cannot be specifically located (or critiqued) in white bodies because white- ness is actually more powerfully signified by Spirit, which does not have an exact figurative representation. Its power magnified by the infinite fluidity produced by its lack of specificity, or passionate vagueness, Spirit can be defined neither as the soul nor as spirituality. Instead, it is enterprise expressed here as energy, will, ambition, the ability to think things through, and the effects of enterprise- discovery, science, business, wealth creation, the building of nation, the organi- zation of labor, etc.: "The most important vehicle for the exercise and thus the display of this dynamic, this enterprise, is imperialism" (Dyer 31). Familiar as Manifest Destiny, this Spirit, or white will, "is literally mapped on to the world in terms of those who have it and those who don't" (31). Gilder has no trouble whatsoever proving he has it, as he re-energizes the imperial frontier: The exaltation of mind and spirit leads to a higher order of experience and a richer access of power than any of the forms of physical dominance and exploitation that pervade the precincts of material pleasure ... human beings can also rise to new pinnacles of vision and power and discover new continents of higher truth. The computer will give mankind new vessels to rule the waves of possibility. Its promise can be betrayed only by the abandonment of the freedom and faith that made it possible. ("The Materialist Superstition") The "ground" of meaning is now Spirit, with its lack of exact parameters, its constant need for renewal, and its infinite fluidity (not so coincidentally identi- cal to the infinite fluidity of money). From such a ground, Gilder's performative technological and economic logic, paradoxically postmodern, makes it possible to condemn anything that appears to be static or that resembles a level playing field. In fact, in a talk to the Progress and Freedom Foundation he argued that were there to be anything like a level playing field, or perfect competition, indus- try and the Internet would flee to Third-World countries, because government regulation and the "retreat to a static economy" would produce "death,' eco- 6 In discussing Christianity, Dyer says this: I am not arguing that Christianity is of its essence white. Given that Christianity developed initially within Judaism, that one of its foundational thinkers was the North African Augustine, and that it is now most alive in Africa, South America and the black churches of Europe and North America, it is by no means clear that whiteness is constitutive of it. Yet not only did Christianity become the religion, and religious export, of Europe, indelibly marking its culture and consciousness, it has also been thought and felt in distinctly white ways for most of its history, seen in relation to, for instance, the following: the persistence of the Manichean dual- ism of black: white that could be mapped on to skin colour difference; the role of the Crusades in racialising the idea of Christendom (making national/geographic others into enemies of Christ); the gentilising and whitening of the image of Christ and the Virgin in painting; the ready appeal to the God of Christianity in the prosecution of doctrines of racial superiority and imperialism. (17)</page><page sequence="9">PERFORMING VIRTUAL WHITENESS/341 nomic and cultural sclerosis. Disequilibrium thus proves to be the very goal and role of technological progress. But what does this have to do with whiteness if whiteness can claim no special figuration, and if it shows up most specifically in tropes and narrative positions of enterprise? White bodies, of course, have a special relation to race, but this special relation is rendered invisible because it is so obvious and cannot be pre- cisely specified. Whereas people of color can be reduced to their bodies, whites, in this frame, cannot, because the very "matter" of the Christian subject is the whiteness of Spirit itself. To repeat, this is a whiteness in the body but not of it. Fundamental to these notions of Spirit, body, and freedom has been the relation of U.S. identity to slavery. That is, as Toni Morrison argues, the claims made for U.S. democracy and freedom have historically been all the more grandiose precisely because they were developed in direct relation to an other who constituted the most con- strained, enslaved, dominated example of unfreedom. The structuring void at the center of this fantasy of freedom, the figuration that covers over the "pres- ence of the unfree within the heart of the democratic experiment," is, in fact, "the critical absence of democracy, its echo, shadow, and silent force" that grounds "the parasitical nature of white freedom" (Playing in the Dark 48, 51). The histori- cal specificity of Morrison's work lends power to Kristeva's more abstract descrip- tion of the unsettling stranger, or "other," at the heart of meaning by showing how crucial it is to historicize that other, as W.J. Cash also argued: "the Negro entered into white man as profoundly as white man entered into Negro-subtly influencing every gesture, every word, every emotion and idea, every attitude" (51). Slavery's effects were not simply localized in the U.S., however; they also had to do with the U.S. relation to the rest of the world, particularly Africa, which provided the exemplary global "silent force" against which the U.S. could define itself. This disembodied embodiment also draws on the discourse of the "common man, who lays a claim to independence and sees every problem in terms of a very specific kind of particularity-his own. The current political landscape of the U.S. has been so inordinately influenced by the South (George W. Bush, Al Gore, Trent Lott, Bob Barr, Asa Hutchinson, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and Bill Clinton, for example7) that it is revealing to follow Cash's de- scription of the way Southern ideology reflects its encounter with African Ameri- cans in the plantation system prior to the Civil War. Cash's book is marred by paternalist racial stereotypes and has obviously been surpassed by other studies. Yet because of the way it captures the tropes and narrative positions of the sentimental romance of Southernness in its focus on the symbolic power that obscures the gap between romance and reality, it provides a helpful commentary on Gilder's entrepreneurial romance, even though Gilder is from an old-line New England family. Gilder's narrative depends, like the myths of the South, on 7 Some of these while not originally from the South have become ideologically "purer" Southern- ers than the natives. For example, Dick Armey grew up in North Dakota, and Newt Gingrich was an army brat who only settled in Cobb County, Georgia, because his research suggested that he might win elections there.</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/342 a particularly coherent rhetoric, the testosterone heights of Western narratives of enterprise, and grand illusion. This does not mean, however, that the "South" or Southerners are by any means homogeneous; rather, their diversity has been made invisible by these rhetorical and figurative structures, now remythologized on a national level. In the rhetoric of the South, the ideology of the individual joined an already strong frontier individualism that was "simple, purely personal, purely self- asserting ... the individualism of the plantation would be one which, like that of the backcountry before it, would be far too much concerned with bald, immedi- ate, unsupported assertion of the ego" (Cash 44). Though that individualism was, in truth, available only to the planter, who was seen "not as an antagonist but as an old friend or kinsman" (54), it emerged as a constitutive belief frozen into place for all: "Come what might, [the poor white] would always be a white man. And before that vast and capacious distinction, all others were foreshortened, dwarfed, and all but obliterated ... The grand outcome was the almost complete disappearance of economic and social focus on the part of the masses" (41). Other important influences on this myth of the individual were the refusal to acknowledge any form of dependency and the development of a concept of iden- tity in terms of a symbolic small town. Such a town was an "imagined community,' even for Southerners who did not live in such towns; this constituted a form of "folking,' in which one identified with "people like us" and condemned outsid- ers. This ideology was powerfully solidified by an external enemy, the North, and reappears in Gilder's contemporary, indirect anti-communism as postmodern, virtual folking. Here, in his universe, "heterogeneous:' "diverse" communities are achieved digitally in "virtual freedom": "electronic neighborhoods bound to- gether not by geography but by shared interests," with most virtual locations existing "as distinct places of private property" In fact, "great cities will hollow out as the best and brightest in them retreat to rural redoubts and reach out to global markets and communities" ("Angst and Awe"). And while we're aware of the influence of the Religious Right in the contem- porary U.S., the seeds of that influence were planted long ago in the Southern rejection of Anglicanism's intellectual abstractions in favor of what Cash has called the anthropomorphic God of the Old Testament, "a passionate, whimsical tyrant, to be trembled before but whose favor was the sweeter for that... a personal God, a God for the individualist, a God whose representatives were not silken priests but preachers risen from the people themselves" This Southern Calvinism rejected a God "without body parts or passions" (Cash 57) and developed a morality that was "exceedingly narrow and fantastic" (236), or in psychoanalytic terms, perhaps, exceedingly narrow and phantasmatic.8 Its preachers, then as now, "exercised a sway in politics far beyond their religious roles" (58), as they dangerouslyjoined church and state. 8 "Phantasmatic" might be defined in general terms as the residue, in terms of the ways images and subsequent thinking develops, of the very first moments in which the body, vision, feeling, and the unconscious come to be linked with social meaning, or symbolization, in the very first moments of language development. This residue from the earliest moments of infancy continues to influence interpretation through the rest of one's life, even though it is constantly reworked in a dialectic relation.</page><page sequence="11">PERFORMING VIRTUAL WHITENESS/343 Finally, Cash describes what he calls "the savage ideal" of Southern identity: "Tolerance, in sum, was pretty well extinguished all along the line, and confor- mity made a nearly universal law" (138), as "criticism, analysis, detachment... took on the aspect of high and aggravated treason" (139). Thus, both after the Civil War and Reconstruction, when the attempt to attract Northern manufacturing led to violent anti-union activity, and after WWI, when emboldened blacks re- turned from Europe, the South grew increasingly "afraid for the precarious mas- tery it had with such great difficulty established" (139), a fear that was later evident in the backlash against the gains of the Civil Rights movement. As Cash describes it, the paternalistic Southern businessman interpreted his business activity as an expression of Christian self-sacrifice for the common good, whereas taxes were linked to Reconstruction's plunder. In this argument, the person who created wealth across the globe and at home became the savior of freedom and deserved a kind of veneration, since entrepreneurial activity was redefined as ethics and compassion. The "individual" here morphed into the entrepreneurial corporate legal person, which (or "who") donned the garb of the rebel against the older industrial, or statist, political economy. Gilder tells us that the highest form of Christian compassion is to engage in global entrepre- neurial wealth creation, now recoded as absolute value and justifying the "ethi- cal" reconstruction of a social system of traditional values. The open secret, of course, is that this ethical system does, in fact, splendidly guarantee capital's potential-for those at the top-because it rests on a belief in "natural" hierarchy that resembles the "sincere and unstudied belief in the old Southern concept of God as the master of an earth in which every man occupied his place because He had set him there" (Cash 236). Moreover, the juxtaposition of this exhilarating, highly abstracted postmodern notion of cyberspace to an anachronistic, anthropomorphic figuration of God, along with Creationism and the Satanic, seems so schizophrenic, so strangely out of time, that it renders the overt visibility of its powerful structure paradoxically invisible. Like the emperor's new clothes, their link is so obvious as to be hidden to Gilder's hip, libertarian, affluent (or hopeful) techie fans and investors. In a similar manner, the Discovery Institute has of late devoted itself to the con- cept of Intelligent Design, which argues that design and intelligent agency are intrinsic in nature. This concept provides, it is argued, more powerful evidence for the origins of life than does Darwinist evolutionary theory, while ostensibly avoiding the reductiveness of Creationism. However, not so coincidentally, the concept of Intelligent Design also mirrors the natural law of Christian theocracy, where "the complex workings of molecular biology and the precise fitness of the cosmos for human life compel the conclusion that the universe-evolution and all-was designed by a benevolent deity for the purpose of producing mankind" (Demski). That this scientific project and Gilder's discovery of the Christian "truth" as the basis of the quantum paradox are related, is suggested by the fact that one of the funders for the Intelligent Design project is Howard Ahmanson, a savings and loan heir long involved with Christian Reconstructionisn, a faction of the Religious Right at its most extreme. Identified with Rousas J. Rushdooney's</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/344 Chalcedon Foundation, Christian Reconstructionism takes the extreme view that conservative Christians should take "dominion" over U.S. society and replace democracy with theocracy; it also advocates a severe version of Biblical law in which the death penalty should be applied to those who threaten a "Christian" society: adulterers, homosexuals, witches, those who spread "false" religions, etc. The teaching of evolution is, in this view, characterized as a "war against Genesis" (see Diamond). The Ahmanson family donated $1.5 million to the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture's research and public- ity program to "unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism's cultural legacy" (Diamond 13). Finally, Gilder's theocracy also joins something else that has become clear in his work. His attack on equilibrium has been breathtakingly generalized to the cultural level in order to ground a resistance to social equality, now equated with Marxism. This is made possible by way of a particular move in Gilder's argument: The key lessons of the era spring from an understanding of hierarchy and freedom. Just as the large integrated circuits at the heart of computers cannot be designed from the bottom up, just as evolution could not have occurred from the bottom up alone, the human mind cannot be under- stood without a clear comprehension of the hierarchical structure of the universe. ("The Materialist Superstition") Though Gilder at other points replaces "hierarchy" by the neologism "heter- archy" in order to refer to the absolute freedom represented by the hacker or the innovator who is able to create change from below, the fact that he produces a literal equation between economics and traditional values leaves hierarchy solidly in place for society at large, if not for techies and investors. This can be traced in the remarks of another highly visible conservative celebrity, George Will, who smoothly links the entrepreneurial need for disequilibrium to an insistence on meritocracy. The key point here is that equilibrium, which has been condemned in relation to entrepreneurial risk, can now be defined as egalitarianism in rela- tion to culture. And both must be resisted. II. George Will and Toni Morrison On a panel in April, 2000, sponsored by the Princeton University Center for Human Values, George Will was seated with Toni Morrison, whose presence on the panel and powerful historicization of academic values foregrounded the academy's inherent role in both producing and examining value-laden discourse. We "teach values by having them," she argued, advocating a tradition of citizen- scholars rather than philosopher kings. And arguing that the university needs to be a "living fleshed" institution rather than a virtual one, she suggested that con- temporary criticisms of the university are based on a view of American culture that is still mired in nineteenth-century nostalgia and a hypocritical denial of the actual power relations of that period. In a direct counter to Morrison, Will turned to DeTocqueville's concerns about the dangers of egalitarianism, arguing that we need to rediscover what was lost in the shift from aristocratic culture to the leveling ethos of democratic institutions and culture. For what was lost was the ability "to look up," to praise, to recognize</page><page sequence="13">PERFORMING VIRTUAL WHITENESS/345 heroes, not role models. Suggesting that Princeton must rise "above a kind of sloppy. . . intellectual egalitarianism"' he advised teaching students to seek "ex- cellence and the exceptional" and lamented the fact that they probably no longer even knew how to identify such things, due, in part, he joked, to the MLA, the concept of "texts," and, by implication, the influence of people like Morrison; her presence left no doubt about the kinds of students whose lack of talent and the ability to "look up" were at issue. But Will's mostjarring contribution came at the end of his talk when he reminded his audience of the axiom "No man is a hero to his valet." One might have expected that this axiom would, in fact, lend support to Morrison's argument that objectivity in interpretation is impossible. However, in a pointedly direct way, Will instead used the axiom to draw a slow, patient bead on a very different target: "In short, I think we need to be reminded daily of the axiom that if no man is a hero to his valet-that is not because no man is a hero-but because all valets are valets" ("Teaching Values at Universities"; my italics). In this stunningly blatant racism, the meritocratic argument comes round to meet Gilder's praise of disequilibrium in the economic sphere. Or as Gilder frames it: "The central error of materialism is to subordinate a higher level of creative activity to a lower one" ("The Materialist Superstition"). With flair, ease, and a dependence on the almost stupefied reaction of the audience (or at least one hopes that was the reaction), Will, like Gilder, had thoroughly condemned egalitarianism and redefined diversity and freedom into their opposites, just as Gilder had done with greed itself. As Gilder says, "Given appropriate social arrangements, diversity can make for a secure and stable civi- lization" ("The Materialist Superstition"). He and Will have also redefined, or "folked," the concept of the "people" by displacing the populist impulse toward the redistribution of wealth onto a hierarchy that masquerades as a democracy of "the people." This is millionaire populism for those who create wealth: "Cyber- space is the latest American frontier. As this and other societies make forays into it, the proposition that ownership of this frontier resides with the people is central to achieving its true potential" ("Cyberspace and the American Dream"). How nice and "ordinary" all this sounds; how easily millionaire (and billion- aire) interests fit into the myths of ordinary Americans. But that's precisely the point. The collapse of a discourse of populism and the common man into the language of the entrepreneurial corporation as person doubles the dangerous fortressing of Lacan's subject. For the "ordinary" person, the denial of the mate- riality of one's own body and of nature also includes a direct identification with those who deny that body's class and race differences. While that doubling enor- mously multiplies the power of the corporate discourse, enabling it to access passion, the emotions of lived experience, and the power of spirituality, the ego that results from such a collapse between the ordinary person and the entrepre- neurial corporate "person" is nevertheless a very brittle one for those whites at the middle and bottom. That subject-position, or ego, is all the more narrow and unstable because of the force of the original egalitarian American rhetoric, which covered over its origins in a plantation system and the simultaneous violence against native peoples. The more that originary rhetoric proves to be false, the more angrily "he" resents collective concern for others. Recognizing the false-</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/346 ness of the populist promise but lacking the means to conceptualize it, he is left with no site of agency except whiteness, as he finds himself inextricably entangled in a rhetorical, symbolic, and phantasmatic trap, a trap brilliantly exploited by media-savvy postmodern traditionalists like Will and Gilder, along with Pat Robertson, Bob Barr, Bill McCartney, and many others. A fascinating example of the way populist resentment is exploited is the case of George W. Bush. Hannah Rosin traces Bush's resentment of "elites" to the 1960s, when he, a legacy Yale student from an old-line, aristocratic New England family, redefined the "elite" as Ivy League civil rights and anti-war activists. Bush's understanding of his resentments was aided by Karl Rove, who presented him with three books that reframed contemporary politics as a cosmic battle between two groups from the 1960s: Myron Magnet's The Dream and the Nightmare: The Sixties'Legacy to the Underclass, which argues that the countercultural elite's values destroyed the poor, and David Horowitz and Peter Collier's Destructive Genera- tion: Second Thoughts About the Sixties (Rosin A01). The third book on the list is, of course, The Tragedy of American Compassion, by Marvin Olasky, an evangelical professor of journalism and communications at the University of Texas at Austin, who coined the phrase "compassionate conser- vatism." In his highly influential 1996 book, Olasky argues that from FDR on, bureaucrats (statists) robbed Americans of their true compassionate, individual- ist impulses. As a result, Olasky recommends what he calls "the advance of bibli- cal poverty-fighting and biblicaljournalism" ("Tweakings") to undo the Roosevelt legacy and abolish the welfare state, replacing it with faith-based institutions and the benevolent desires of the more fortunate to engage in personal forms of charity of their choice. The book was funded by a fellowship from the Heritage Foundation and sports an introduction by Charles Murray, whose book, The Bell Curve, resurrected old notions of the biological inferiority of black intelligence. Olasky also came under fire after an interview in 1998, in which he concluded that while women are not forbidden to be leaders in society, they have different natures than do men and therefore become leaders only with the abdication of men: "As in the situation of Deborah and Barak [in the Bible], there's a certain shame attached to it. I would vote for a woman for the presidency, in some situa- tions, but again, there's a certain shame attached. Why don't you have a man who's able to step forward?" (Hart). III. The Blondes There is one other way that the visible invisibility of the whiteness of entrepre- neurial corporate discourse is able to shift blame onto racialized subjects, women, gays, and white working people. I want to illustrate this with a consideration of several other highly visible conservative celebrities-Ann Coulter, the late Bar- bara Olsen, Laura Ingraham, and Kellyanne Fitzpatrick-who, like Gilder and Will, reveal the anxiety of whiteness at stake in this reconstituted hierarchical structure in a visual culture.9 As the ordinariness of whiteness has become harder to sustain in an increasingly diverse world, the contradictions inherent in the "being without properties" become more and more evident. The brittle, abstract</page><page sequence="15">PERFORMING VIRTUAL WHITENESS/347 subjectivity constructed out of the denial of the supremacist nature of our social structure increasingly reveals the fear of "an annihilation that will be the realisa- tion of [white] emptiness," a "feeling that deep down, whites have had their day" (Dyer 222). During the Clinton years and particularly during the impeachment process, a fascinating example of whiteness could be seen on cable television talk shows, where a bevy of very conservative young blonde Republican women, most of whom were attorneys affiliated with the conservative Federalist Society and the Independent Women's Forum, an anti-feminist professional women's organiza- tion based in Washington, D.C., became the most visible critics of liberalism. In this period, liberalism, socialism, and communism morphed into "Bill and Hillary," or "Billary," a process which inspired visceral reactions across the spectrum of the right. Several of the Blondes had also written anti-Clinton or anti-Hillary books, which generally made it to the top of conservative bestseller lists. While the sym- bolic resonance of blondeness deserves much more discussion than it can re- ceive here, given its devastating effects on women, it also provides a particular symbolic repertory in which women of privilege can exploit a misogynist social structure, and in particular a white supremacist social structure. All of these women except Ingraham (who has since let her hair grow) sported a long, slinky hairstyle that seemed almost purposely designed to counter the shorter profes- sional, "sensible" -and perhaps androgynous-haircuts that seemed to be coded as liberal, feminist, or lesbian. The images of the Blondes were at once so ubiqui- tous and striking, and yet so pointedly different from the diversity and feminism advocated by liberals, that they took on powerful symbolic force in a culture of visibility and media spectacle. For that reason, without judging their personal intentions in terms of race, one can nevertheless assess the symbolic effect of their appearance. The relation between their whiteness and the frame of con- temporary politics illustrated the strangely invisible but extremely visible pres- ence of race, which was, to repeat Morrison, so "completely embedded in daily discourse that it [was] perhaps more necessary and more on display than ever before" (63). 9 As is well known, Barbara Olson died on the hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 to Los Angeles that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11. In spite of her death, however, her impact on U.S. politics requires analysis, in particular because of a decision made by her husband, Theodore Olson, to go ahead with the publication of her last "Billary" Clinton-bashing book, The FinalDays: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House, which she had finished several days before her death. At first, her publisher, the right-wing Regnery Publishing, suspended publication in the bipar- tisan climate of unity immediately following the attacks. However, after consulting her husband, who is now the controversial Solicitor General and member of the Federalist Society-and who had been involved in the Scaife-funded Arkansas Project to bring down Clinton, and who headed the team of lawyers that blocked the recount of Presidential votes in Florida and so guaranteed the victory of George W. Bush-Regnery went ahead with publication, increasing its planned run to 100,000 copies. As Martin Fletcher writes in the The Times of London, "An envelope in each copy invites readers to donate to the Barbara Olson Memorial Scholarship Fund." The book has also been publicized by many conservative groups as a fundraiser. As Alfred Regnery, the president of the publishing house, said, "Barbara never shied away from controversy. Her family, friends and colleagues all thought she would be pleased to know that even terrorists could not keep her opin- ions from being known ... She never would have countenanced the thought that terrorism could still her voice or cancel her work" (Fletcher, The Times 8 Oct. 2001). Neither should it still criticism of that work.</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /348 Ann Coulter</page><page sequence="17">PERFORMING VIRTUAL WHITENESS/349 Barbara Olson</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /350 How much whiter could one be? While none of these conservative women advocated whiteness at the overt level of, say, the Klan, nevertheless, the fact that they were constantly selected as spokespersons, in spite of the narrowness of their expertise and the conservatism of their politics, provided the figurative resources of pure whiteness and pure gender. One might argue that the function of these images was to compensate for the fact that, as Dyer has argued, white- ness is not stabilized by figuration but instead by narrative positioning within the plot of Spirit and the energy of enterprise. In other words, without a specific figuration or image, that narrative positioning of whiteness could be experienced as far too fluid and unstable, even if the economic rhetoric argued for precisely such fluidity. Fluidity in financial terms, in other words, needed to be grounded by stability in figuration and social hierarchy. In this case, the Blondes-very specific, marked instances of spectacularized, pure white gender-came to ex- emplify whiteness in its purest contemporary incarnation, even if there were very few whites to match the image. As Brennan and Lacan have argued, the results of a requirement to claim a rigid identity that the social structure makes impossible is the very mechanism of paranoic alienation. In Dyer's study, such images, what he calls "extreme whiteness" or exaggerated representations of whiteness from which the ordinary white individual can take his distance, have appeared his- torically "in certain periods of derangement-the empires at their height, the Fascist eras" (223). The spectacularized Blondes also provided a form of extreme Gender that grounds extreme whiteness in a traditional, God-given, heterosexual masculinity that participates in the warrior identity espoused by Gilder, that depends on the symbolic guarantee of the True Woman, and that, as a result, is most threatened by female control of reproduction. And at the same time that the appearances of the Blondes strikingly signified extreme Gender in the interests of white mascu- linity, they also coincided with media representations of extreme Color: reality TV shows about inner-city crime, the visibility of militant Black Muslims as op- posed to academics or professionals as African-American spokespeople, and spectacularized Puerto Rican wilding, a term coined to describe violent rioting by gangs of urban minority youths. Perhaps most important, extreme whiteness makes possible the visible invis- ibility central to neoconservatism. As Dyer argues: Whites can thus believe that they are nothing in particular, because the white particularities on offer are so obviously not them. Extreme whiteness thus leaves a residue, a way of being that is not marked as white, in which white people can see themselves. This residue is non-particularity, the space of ordinariness [defined as individualism]. The combination of extreme whiteness with plain, unwhite whiteness means that white people can both lay claim to the spirit that aspires to the heights of humanity and yet supposedly speak and act disinterestedly as humanity's most average and unre- markable representatives. (223) Because most whites are not like Gilder, Will, or the Blondes, the prominence of these celebrities makes it very easy, if one happens to be white, to be "ordinary, fair, and disinterested," passionately condemning racism and bigotry on the one hand while just as passionately insisting on a color-blind meritocracy and the dismantling of social services, on the other, and all the while failing to see how contradictory those two attitudes might be.</page><page sequence="19">PERFORMING VIRTUAL WHITENESS/351 Invisible but blatantly, openly visible in a mediatized culture of visibility-ex- treme whiteness and the spirit of enterprise thus come to provide the param- eters not only for Virtual Whiteness and its psychic fantasy of globalization but also for democracy itself. The goal of studying this frame of whiteness here is twofold: to point out its parameters, but also, just as important, to address the issue with which we began, namely, the struggle over the definition of intellec- tual rigor and democracy. What Gilder and the others have given us is clarity, but in a very specific and reductive sense; produced in a narrow form of binary logic and reinforced by a media society that keeps us locked in the supremacist frame, this form of clarity strategically closes down the project of critical thinking. I call this the clarity of passionate vagueness, a powerful, emotional clarity that is achieved precisely because of the exclusion of critical thinking. For it is critical thinking that recognizes the complexity and messiness of interpretation, as well as the need for a dialectical (that is, historical) study that draws simultaneously on two frames at once: one that sets out the structure, and one that investigates individual differences. And while Gilder, Will, and the Blondes are far more com- plicated than can be discussed here, I have studied them through the structural side of the dialectic precisely because U.S. culture trains us to do the opposite, to see them only as individuals, to discount historical interpretation as relativism, and to think only "clearly"-at a high rate of speed that excludes reflection. The perpetuation of the frame of whiteness is not simply a problem of per- sonal intent, even if it is all too often that. Supremacy is also a blindness, an ignorance-and even more than that, a powerfully enforced ignorance regard- ing the system of effects in which we are all entangled. And if it is the case that race as it relates to people of color is a constructed, not a natural, category, then that is also true of whiteness. Both are instead the effects of a very old, very entrenched logical, rhetorical, and political structure that causes critics and de- fenders alike to interpret things in a supremacist way before we even know it. Intervention in this structure is unequivocally performative; that is, it is about both activism and theory, color and whiteness, rigorous thought and the recog- nition of the truths of emotions, bodies, and nature. As the virtual fantasy of globalization counts on keeping us locked in a false clarity that represses the inextricable mixture and messiness of interpretation, nature, and human bod- ies, it also produces an enormously fragmented world, while demanding an iden- tity and a system of thought in which fluidity is experienced as a loss of stability. This is precisely the structure that reproduces binary contests that lock us into paranoic alienation, no matter which side we're on, or, in Lacan's words, into "two opposed fields of contest where the subject flounders in quest of the lofty, remote inner castle" (5). Perhaps the reductiveness of supremacist logic can be countered by insisting on something called gentle rigorjoined to political activism, by taking the risk of finding a new form of stability in intelligent, thoughtful fluidity through which we come to grips with the reinterpretation of changing, interconnected identi- ties as a gain, not a loss, even if, or especially if, such a risk is often unsettling because it denies the thinker the passions of being completely right, the rewards of "the lofty, remote inner castle." This also means taking the historically neces-</page><page sequence="20">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/352 sary step of countering the years of anti-intellectual theory bashing from both right and left by insisting that complex, rigorous thought is not necessarily or inherently elitist-even if it always can be. In an era in which passionately vague clarity, sound bites, and anti-intellectualism constitute the prevailing mode of thought, or rather, the prevailing mode of mystification, gentle rigor linked to activism can be profoundly political. Rigorous thought by embodied subjects in "living fleshed" institutions-Morrison has already suggested a way to challenge the virtual psychic fantasy of globalization.
