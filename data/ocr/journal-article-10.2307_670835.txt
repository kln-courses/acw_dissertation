<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Publications Received As of August 6, 1969 The following publications on anthropological and closely related topics have been received since the previous list was closed. Only books, monographs, and the initial issues of new journals are listed; space limitations prevent inclusion of subsequent journal issues and of off-prints of single articles from journals. No exchanges are con- ducted, nor can any item be returned. Books that publishers or authors send to the Book Review Editor before or immediately after their publication dates are more likely to be reviewed, and usually will be reviewed sooner, than those that he must discover himself. This listing serves to acknowledge receipt of such items, but neither promises nor pre- cludes subsequent publication of reviews. REPRINTS, NEW EDITIONS, AND TRANSLATIONS Adolph, E.

Focusing on the ideas, rules and principles of Tewa culture as they are reflected in myth, world view and religious rite-as well as Tewa notions of space, time, color, number, and existence-he determines how these exemplify, reinforce, and lend continuity to Tewa social institutions. The book is not a descriptive monograph, but an essay in cultural analysis, one which views culture as a system of symbols and which takes form under the impact of mcdern structural theory. 1969 LC:72-94079 198 pages $8.00 4 JW L ld 4 46 THE ETHNOGRAPHY OF FRANZ BOAS Letters and Diaries of Franz Boas Written on the Northwest Coast from 1886 to 1931 Compiled and Edited by Ronald P. Rohner With an Introduction by Ronald P. Rohner and Evelyn C. Rohner Translated by Hedy Parker This volume-based on almost seven hundred pages of letters and diaries which Boas wrote while on the North Pacific Coast--contains an introduction in which his field activities and conceptual orientations toward ethnographic and ethnological research are placed within the broader context of the work being done by his nineteenth century predecessors and con- temporaries. Boas, the Rohners conclude, played an instrumental role in reorganizing Amer- ican anthropology as a distinct intellectual discipline, primarily by effectively challenging and reformulating older concepts and approaches. 1969 LC:70-77152 332 pages $12.50 HUNTERS OF THE NORTHERN ICE Richard K.

His is the first account of Eskimo hunting techniques learned by direct participation. More than a faithful account of ice hunting, however, it extends our knowl- edge of how the Eskimos adapted themselves to their arduous ice-covered environment. 1969 LC:78-75136 446 pages Illus. $8.50 The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois 60637 224</page><page sequence="14">Reference Works from G.

Chard, Professor of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin. 351 pages, $7.95 The scope of this text is worldwide and the thesis is stressed that no area, group, or period is inherently more significant than any other in understanding culture process and human behavior. The book explains the contributions that an understanding of prehistory can make to the understanding of human behavior and contemporary problems, defines the nature and scope of the field, and describes the methods by which the data of prehistory are recovered and interpreted. Considerable space is devoted to human cultural origins and the role of culture in human evolution- subjects rarely discussed in prehistory texts. Jennings-PREHISTORY OF NORTH AMERICA Jesse D. Jennings, Professor of Anthropology, University of Utah. 391 pages, $9.95 This textbook in archaeology deals with the problems of man's entry into North America and with his cultural development through twelve thousand years up to the historic period. The author employs a human ecology theme, emphasizing the im- portance of man in managing his cultural environment. Successfully avoiding the creation of an encyclopedic reference work, the author has instead captured the "flavor" of field work and the exciting order, consistency, and unbelievable efficiency of many North American cultures.

The text reconstructs the economic, social, and political life of a Tarascan Indian village about the turn of the century, and then describes the econ- omic and political causes of agrarian unrest and the 40-year history of a dramatic local revolt in the 1920's. The analysis bears directly on several major components of contempo- rary political anthropology: problems of local violence and ideoloeically motivated revolution; the relation of traditional ritual to revolutionary politics; the relation of the local village to encapsulating macro-structures. ... available in both paper and cloth bound versions, approx. 192 pp., in May, 1970 POSITIVELY BLACK Roger D. Abrahams, University of Texas Here is an honest attempt to gain greater understanding of black culture through an explication of the cultural experience and expression of black people in America. Essentially written for a white audience, this book consists primarily of analysis of expressive-rather than the usual institutional--culture. The expressive materials included have been utilized to investigate the group's own sense of social structure and its own concepts of what constitutes deviance and immorality. By viewing, in this new light, certain aspects of Negro culture that com- monly bring about a stereotype response when encountered by whites, the author hopes to establish an area of understanding that previously did not exist.

WOLF Using the cases of Mexico, Russia, China, Viet Nam, Algiers, and Cuba, this book traces the course of peasant involvement in major political upheavals of the twentieth century. The larger society within which the rebellions have occurred is described and analyzed, but the main focus of the text is on the peasantry-its modes of life, community organization, life systems, and particular problems. Participation of peasant populations in revolution and rebellion is presented as the outcome of long-standing imbalances in peasant life. A basis for formulation of broader generalizations regarding the mobilization of peasant masses in revo- lutionary movements is provided by the discussions of specific cases.

Dealing primarily with issues of survival, establishing rapport, and col- lecting data, the reports supply realistic background information on what to expect in the field. Solutions to the arising prob. lems, both those that were successful and those that failed, are presented in detail for consideration. Essays are grouped in categories for comparative study. The edi- tor's concluding chapter analyzes field re- search in terms of 14 problems; among them are some pertaining only to students (i.e., finding a graduate program and find- ing an area of specialization).

Kelso, University of Colorado This new text provides an up-to-date review and interpreta- tion of the main components of physical anthropology- genetics, evolutionary mechanisms, and the human fossil record. With the introduction of the concept of human heterography, the distinct character of this book will be evident to the professional. Since the author's approach makes no assumptions about the way in which human varia- tions should be grouped together, the common racial classi- fications are ignored. For students, Professor Kelso's ap- proach to the study of the significance of today's biological variation among human populations affords a clearer and simpler introduction to a complex field that continues to de- velop and change in response to research findings. Professor Kelso provides a thorough treatment of recent genetic theory, and explores the usefulness of population genetics in detecting changes in the structure of existing populations, tracing past migrations, and in establishing de- grees of biological relationships among contemporary popu- lations. A final chapter speculates on the direction of evolu- tion in the future. 450 pages February 1970 About $8.50 A comprehensive Instructor's Manual, prepared by Kenneth Beals, contains helpful suggestions for lectures, topics for class discus- sion, bibliographies, and an Appendix which lists teaching aids, laboratory equipment and their sources.

Thompson The most spectacular archaeological discovery of our time was made at Pazyryk in the Altai Mountains of western Siberia: here, perfectly preserved in the ice for 2500 years, were the tattooed bodies of many nomad chiefs-probably the Scyth- ians mentioned by Herodotus-and their horses. Within the chambers everything of organic origin was in almost pristine condition. Many perishable objects, whose existence in other burial sites of the same period could only be inferred, were here to be examined-everyday articles as well as sumptuous ritualistic pieces; hemp- smoking equipment; carts, wagons, saddlery--of better design and workmanship than any known to the later, classical world. The remarkable pictures accompany- ing the text vivify the strange beauty of a remote time and place. 1969 LC: 69-20480 254 pages illustrations large format $30.00 The Olmec World Ignacio Bernal Translated by Doris Heyden and Fernando Horcasitas In an engrossing reconstruction, Ignacio Bernal examines Olmec art, society, and religious beliefs.

Deetz Brown University Various methods and their underlying theoretical basis as used by the archaeologist, are examined in this reader. Before any work can be done on archaeological data, it must, in most cases, be excavated and the body of field techniques involved herein is vast. Once freed from the ground, the archaeologist must order-integrate his data for optimum explanatory use. With the properly organized corpus of data, the archaeologist sets to work to understand how these data inform us today about life from the past. A READER IN HUMAN EVOLUTION Phyllis Jay Dolhinow and Vincent Sarich University of California, Berkeley A modern framework within which certain basic problems of human evolution are considered. Specific emphasis is on the question of human origins, behavior, evolution, fossil man, and modern human variation.

Simmons University of California, Berkeley The selections are intended to give the student both a general idea of the major issues in cultural anthropology today and a specific idea of what anthropologists are doing in detailed analysis. The authors have avoided merely programmatic statements with little empirical foundation. The selections, with a broad philosophical scope and a grasp of essential issues, are based in a tradition of solid observation. Each section has an introduction by the authors.

Without undue emphasis on either practical or theoretical orientation, topics covered include definitions of archaeology, survey, excavation, dating, economic archaeology, and the analysis of artifacts and settlement papers.

J. lanni Columbia Teachers College Edward Storey Southeastern Educational Lab The book is concerned with the cultural crisis taking place in Education today; its unique aspect is the fact that its analysis is by anthropologists. Intended for an audience interested in the basic distinctions between the Anthropology of and the Anthropology in Education, the book surveys much, if not all, of the literature extant and is enhanced, as well, by current developments. It is also expected that considerable use of the book will be made by new anthropologists in the field of Education, new educators in the field of Anthropology, and by new students in both Education and Anthropology, as well as by sociologists and historians teaching such foundation courses. 246</page><page sequence="36">Little, Brown and Company 34 Beacon St. Boston, Mass. 02106 VILLAGE LIFE IN CHINA Arthur H. Smith with a new introduction by MYRON COHEN of Columbia University A comprehensive multi-faceted view of life in China during the late Imperial period (1880's). The author emphasizes China's rural society with special attention given to village organization, co-operative activities and educational systems. The book was written from the standpoint of one who, by an extended experience in China, had come to feel profound respect for the numerous admirable qualities of the Chinese. The book is heavily illustrated with contemporary photographs and incorporates a glossary of selected terms. Paperbound / 320 pages Coming in April YOU OWE YOURSELF A DRUNK An Ethnography of Urban Nomads James P. Spradley Macalester College An account of the experiences of men who are repeatedly arrested for public drunkenness in the cities of America. The book challenges the idea that these men are simply rejects from society, who cannot organize their behavior by cultural traditions. The study is based upon recently developed methods of formal ethnographic analysis and presents those aspects of this urban sub-culture which have to do with law enforcement agencies. Life in one jail is described in detail, showing how it changes the men's personal identities, teaches them the skills of this sub-culture, and motivates them to adopt a nomadic way of life, where drinking is of great social value.

In this book the editors and authors discuss the nature and scope of archeological inquiry, provide important and sometimes controversial in- sight into the current debate about what archeology is and does, reevaluate the roles of theory and method, and demonstrate a variety of new kinds of questions that can be legitimately asked and used once theory becomes an explicit tool in the science. 373 pp. $9.75.
