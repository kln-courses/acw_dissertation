Lin translates the text of the Tao Te Ching and provides the first translation into English of the brilliant commentary by Wang Pi (A.D. 226-249), which may be the earliest surviving response. (Kaltenmark dates the one by Ho Shang-kung to the end of the second century, probably a few years earlier than Wang Pi's. It is a more religious interpretation, however, and so could well be later than Wang Pi's. The same is true of the Hsiang-erh commentary, a copy of which was discovered at Tun-huang and which is supposedly by Chang Lu, who lived during the second century A. D.). Lin also provides the first English translation of the biography of Wang Pi by Ho Shao (236-301). Last but not least, he explains the significance of the</page><page sequence="2">360 JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES earliest known version of the Tao Te Ching, the Ma-wang-tui text, dated between 206 and 195 B.C., which was discovered in Hunan in 1973-74. He points out, line by line, the differences between the Ma-wang-tui version and the standard text. In 1970 Ch'en Ku-ying published in Taiwan his illuminating Chinese inteIpreta- tion of the Tao Te Ching. Seven years later-the same year Lin's book was published -Ch'en's book was translated and published in English. Each chapter appears first in English, then in Chinese, followed by an English translation of Ch'en's notes and comments, which include excerpts from many famous commentaries. No one knows how many translations of Lao-tzu exist in how many languages. Lin estimates between seventy and eighty in English alone. In his introduction Lin does a real service by comparing several English translations of individual lines of the standard Chinese text. He points out, as scholars have before, the paradoxical, enigmatic quality of Lao-tzu's words. He also describes the problems of interpreting Chou dynasty Chinese, which was often written on bamboo slips held together by strings. Strings rot, and lines fall out of their intended sequence; as a result, the original order of lines in the Tao Te Ching is still debated. The two oldest known texts of the I Ching were also discovered at Ma-wang-tui. One was similar to the standard text, the other differed radically in its second half, which may make much of Richard Wilhelm and C. J. Jung's work dated, if not obsolete. (Wang Pi also wrote a commentary on the I Ching. So this gifted young man, who died at the age of twenty-four, is of great importance to us, and it is good to have a translation of his biography by Ho Shao.) The Ma-wang-tui text has, as Lin points out, a Legalist bias. In it, the Te chapters come before the Tao chapters, that is, action comes before philosophy. It is ironic that this oldest text was excavated during the lifetime of Mao Tse-tung, who admired the Legalists. The commentary by Wang Pi-and all except one of the translations into English (published recently by Alfaguara)-are based on the stan- dard text. They retain what I think was Lao-tzu's sequence: first to understand, and then to act. (Inevitably, many principles of action are mentioned in the Tao chapters, and many principles of philosophy are mentioned in the Te chapters.) This book has a few flaws. There is no index. It does offer exhaustive and thoroughly professional bibliographies of works in Chinese and Japanese, but the third section of the bibliography (general references) has a few problems. On p. 197, for example, the date of D. T. Suzuki's translation of Lao-tzu is given as 1964 and the title as The Canon of Reason and Virtue. My copy is entitled Lao-Tze's Tao-Te-King, and was published in 1898. Similarly, James Legge's translation is dated 1962. My copy was published in 1891. More serious is the fact that Lin omits mention of Bernhard Karlgren's Notes on Lao-tse (Stockholm, 1975) and his The Poetical Parts of Lao Tsi (Goteborg, 1932). Lin persists in spelling Tao-tsang as Tao-ts'ang. Yet Lin's book is succinct and important. Let me give three examples of why I say this. Lin translates lines 7-8 of Chapter 1 as follows: "But constantly with desire [there is) only the realization of potentiality." He translates Wang Pi's comment: "Potentiality returns to the ultimate. All benefits of being must be based on the usefulness of non-being. Desire must be rooted in Tao in order to prevail. Therefore one constantly has desires in order to understand the potential of ultimate things." This helps me, at least, to understand what Lao-tzu meant. In Chapter 5 Wang Pi finds a meaning that is the opposite of what most have found there. Ancient Chinese had no parts of speech; syntax lay in the sequence of the words. Therefore, when Lao-tzu speaks of straw dogs, he may (as Lin points out)</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS-CHINA 361 mean either straw and dogs, or dogs made of straw, which were used in sacrifice for rain and then discarded. In his footnote to Wang Pi's commentary, Lin agrees with Arthur Waley. But Lin seems more ambiguous than Waley. Waley renders the first line of Chapter 5: "Heaven and Earth are ruthless; to them the ten thousand things are but as straw dogs." Lin renders it: "Without kindness heaven and earth treat all things as straw dogs. " (Presumably Lin means: "Since heaven and earth are, of course, unkind. . . . ") In the second book under review, Ch'en Ku-ying renders the same lines: "Heaven and Earth are amoral. They consider the myriad things to be straw dogs." Ch'en then gives a full page of notes on these words. He quotes five Chinese commentaries, and one in Japanese. Yet there seems to be general agreement now on what Lao-tzu is telling us in Chapter 5: that the universe is not anthropomorphic in its behavior. In Chapter 49 Lin explains well the problems presented by the two words hai-chih ("infants it" or "infants them"). He quotes ten translations into English. His own translation is eleventh: "The people all strain their ears and eyes. And the Sage regards them all as infants. " (The most surprising translation of this is by John C. H. Wu: "The Sage only smiles like an amused infant.") Many of Lin's notes on Wang Pi's commentary are ifluminating. For example, Wang comments on the ninth line of the first chapter: " 'The two' refers to the origin and the mother." Lin points out that, of the seven existing versions of Wang Pi, four use "mother" for the last word and three use "nothingness." Lin agrees with those of us who think that the Tao Te Ching was written by one man. He is not interested in who Lao-tzu was or when or why he wrote. The point is that we have a book that has made Lao-tzu immortal. Parts of it have no doubt been corrupted, particularly by the insertion of commentary into text. As Lin points out, the problems presented by the text (at least three versions of which existed by 221 B.C.) have inspired 600 or more commentaries in Chinese over the centuries. (Yang and Ames list 104, with names, dates, and their own com- ments.) Some, like the Ho Shang-kung commentary, created their own schools of thought. There is scarcely a well-known Chinese scholar in the past 2,000 years who has not had a try at commenting on the Tao Te Ching: Yen Shih-ku; Ch'eng Hsiuan-ying; Su Ch'e; the great but unlucky T'ang emperor Hsuan-tung; Wang P'ang; Wang Chen; Wang An-shih; Wang Fu-chih; Wang 1-ching; Wang Huai; Wu Ch'eng-and the authors under review, Paul J. Lin and Ch'en Ku-ying. What else need to be said about the books of Lin and Ch'en? Lin has made a major contribution to our understanding of the Tao Te Ching. He is as modest as he is well-informed. Ch'en's interpretation, the fruit of years of thought and investigation by a Chinese scholar, is also valuable. We should be grateful to Robert Irick for making it available to us.
