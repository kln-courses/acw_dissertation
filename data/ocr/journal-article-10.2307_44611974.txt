ABSTRACT The recently developed Model S 103 5 Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) represents the latest generation pressure suit system developed for the NASA Space Shuttle program, and serves as a replacement for the S 1032 Launch Entry Suit (LES). The S 1032 Launch Entry Suit (LES) was developed following the Challenger loss and NASA's decision to integrate a Shuttle crew escape system. The development effort took advantage of previous pressure suit developments, with each major LES component being selected from previously qualified systems. The primary design challenge was one of design integration with the Orbiter and other crew escape equipment. The S 1032 LES has successfully supported Shuttle missions since NASA's Return to Flight with STS-26 in September 1988. Initiated in 1990, the S 103 5 ACES was designed to be a simplified, lightweight, low bulk pressure suit which facilitated self donning/doffing, provided improved comfort and enhanced overall performance in order to reduce crew member stress and fatigue. Favorable crew member evaluations of a prototype led to full scale development and qualification of the S 103 5 ACES between 1990 and 1992. Production of the S1035 ACES commenced in February 1993, with the first unit being delivered to NASA in May 1994. The S 1035 ACES first flew aboard STS-68 in August 1994 and will become the primary crew escape suit when the S 1032 LES reaches the end of its service life beginning in late 1995. BACKGROUND The first four Space Shuttle flights, conducted between April 1981 and July 1982, were considered test flights, and as such, the Orbiter was equipped with ejection seats for its two man crew who were outfitted with Model's 1030A Ejection Escape Suits (EES). These full pressure suits satisfied Orbital Flight Test (OFT) program emergency egress requirements at speeds up to Mach 2.7 and altitudes up to 80,000 feet (24,384 meters). The S1030A was a variant of the USAF S1030 Pilot's Protective Assembly then worn by SR-71 crew members, modified with an integrated Anti-G Suit. After the successful completion of these initial Shuttle test flights, ejection seats and pressure suits were removed when the Shuttle was deemed to be "operational". Subsequently, crew members wore conventional intra- vehicular activity (IVA) "shirt sleeves" clothing, and a clamshell-type helmet to provide supplemental oxygen in the event of a cabin depressurization during launch or re-entry. Following the Challenger loss, and NASA's decision to reintegrate a crew escape system to each of its Orbiters, a fast- track development effort was initiated to develop a pressure suit which would provide hypobaric protection to crew members during the launch and re-entry phases of flight as well as cold water immersion protection in the event of a bail- out over water. As a direct result of the program requirement for a compressed development schedule, the S 1032 Launch Entry Suit (LES) development effort took advantage of previous pressure suit development work, and resulted in the integration of suit components from previously qualified systems. Reference Figure 1. To date, the S 1032 LES has successfully supported 42 Shuttle missions, beginning with NASA's Return to Flight (STS-26) in September 1988. INTRODUCTION With the S 1032 LES nearing the end of its service life beginning in late 1995, a "clean slate" approach to the design and development of a "next generation" replacement suit was undertaken, drawing heavily from a USAF sponsored effort which spawned the S 1034 Pilot's Protective Assembly (PPA). Design objectives were established with the goal of developing a suit which reduced crew member stress and fatigue while satisfying all program requirements for emergency crew escape. This paper describes the design and development of the S 103 5 Advanced Crew Escape Suit as the latest generation pressure suit system selected for Shuttle operations. 696</page><page sequence="2">697 h н- z Ш X о ^ z СО D Ш см со о т- со J ш о О S ' / ' ' ' ' ' ' .i Ю Q ł- &lt;/) UJ О Ш -r'- Od &lt;2* $ OÍÃ «iz О &lt; Э СмСг- Э .2* Ш Q о О К ш Л 55 Ш I fe ¡5¿ fe 8¡¡ iilSiiü II ä| 8&lt; is i§ i 33 ¡¡i |ш»е ¡s « ä| 8&lt; i £8 I m i i 2 m «■•-•• « £8 "g2- 2 5g &lt; &lt; э о Q К Й ?

In order to achieve this, five fundamental design objectives were established which served as a framework around which a variety of material/configuration changes were adopted. SIMPLIFICATION OF DESIGN - The general configura- tion change from a partial pressure (SI 032 LES) to a full pressure (SI 03 5 ACES) coverall was the primary factor resulting in simplified manufacturing, assembly, testing and field serviceability methods. Partial pressure suits, by design, incorporate air-filled, double-walled bladders between the wearer's body and the outer layer of the suit, thereby providing direct mechanical counter pressure to the body upon inflation. Full pressure suits, on the other hand, encapsulate the wearer in an air-tight anthropomorphic pressure vessel ("balloon"), which when pressurized, results in pneumatic pressure being applied to the body. The change from partial to full pressure construction enabled the elimination of one complete layer of the coverall, as the double-walled pressure bladder was replaced with a single layer gas container. Another improvement which simplified design was the complete redesign of the coverall legs. Typically, full pressure suits incorporate three layers; namely, the gas container (the air impermeable layer proximal to the wearer's body), the restraint layer (which prevents the gas container from distending upon inflation and causes the garment to conform to the wearer's body), and the exterior cover (which primarily provides flame and abrasion protection to the coverall). In the design of the S 1035 ACES legs, the functions of the restraint and exterior cover layer were incor- porated into a single layer of high temperature woven fabric. This integrated design approach allowed for the elimination of one entire layer, further simplifying the coverall design. Additional improvements to the coverall design were made through the use of a "breathable" material in the construction of the gas container layer. The term "breathable" refers to the material's ability to allow perspiration (in the form of water vapor) to pass from inside to outside, while retaining internal gas (air) pressure. This material property also permitted the standard vent system to be greatly simplified (shortened) with no perceptible change in comfort level to the wearer. Finally, the selection of a pressure sealing closure (PSC) which functioned both as a pressure sealing and restraint (structural) closure eliminated the need for two, independently operated slide fasteners and further simplified the design of the coverall. MINIMIZATION OF COVERALL WEIGHT - Generally, in order to maximize the performance of the suited crew member, coverall weight must be kept to a minimum. Accordingly, this task was identified as one of the design objectives for the S 103 5 ACES development effort. As mentioned previously, the selection of a full pressure coverall design (relative to a partial pressure configuration) resulted in the elimination of one entire layer of the suit (inner bladder layer) thereby reducing some weight. Conversely, the use of a breathable material in the construction of the gas container resulted in a minor weight increase since this material is slightly heavier than the urethane coated nylon materials typically used in this application. The benefits of increased comfort, reduced bulk, and reduced thermal load associate to breathable materials, however, more than offset this minor increase in weight. In order to minimize this overall net gain in weight, other softgoods changes were implemented, namely, the elimination of a separate restraint layer in the coverall legs, and the abbreviation of the vent duct assembly. Another weight trade-off involved the requirement for glove disconnect hardware necessitated by the selection of the full pressure coverall/gloves design. The net result was the development of a full pressure coverall which is slightly lighter in weight than previous designs. REDUCTION OF COVERALL BULK - In addition to minimizing coverall weight, the reduction of bulk is most important to maximizing the overall performance of the coverall. In addition to reducing the stress experienced by the wearer, low bulk serves to enhance mobility and improve the crew member's overall performance. Towards this end, the configuration change from partial to full pressure resulted in a coverall with fewer layers and considerably less bulk. Bulk was further reduced via the redesign of the coverall legs and the elimination of a separate restraint in that area. The use of a single entry closure (slide fastener) which functioned as both a pressure sealing and restraint closure further contributed to the reduction of coverall bulk. Most important, however, was the use of a breathable material in the construction of the gas container portion of the coverall. Although slightly heavier in weight compared with the traditional urethane coated nylons typically used for this application, the breathable material exhibits a much softer "hand", thereby significantly reducing bulk. Furthermore, the overall reduction of thermal load resulting from the use of this material permitted the abbreviation of the internal vent duct assembly in the leg areas of the coverall. IMPROVEMENTS TO AID IN SELF DON/DOFF - Although not a specific requirement, the ability for a crew member to don and doff the coverall with little or no assistance helps to reduce stress and fatigue associate to that activity. Accordingly, a full pressure coverall was a logical choice over the partial pressure design, due to its reduced bulk, weight, and complexity. Furthermore, the use of a multi-function pressure sealing closure (reference above) eliminated at least one step in the donning/doffing processes. 698</page><page sequence="4">Additional improvements to aid in self don/doff were made via a redesigned glove disconnect assembly. This assembly incorporated a larger ID (with no change to the overall OD) and an improved locking mechanism which facilitated locking and unlocking with both the gloved or bare hand. IMPROVEMENTS TO COMFORT - Several of the material/configuration changes adopted to satisfy other design objectives resulted in a marked improvement in the comfort of the ACES coverall. Namely, the selection of a full pressure coverall design, the use of a breathable gas container material, and the elimination of a separate restraint layer in the legs contributed towards that end. Further improvements were made with the development of an improved full pressure glove. This glove design utilized a bladder assembly constructed from breathable materials in the wrist, palm, and backhand areas to reduce thermal load, and an outer restraint incorporating a combination of both flat and tucked patterning to reduce the torque associate to flexion/extension of the hand joints in both the pressurized and unpressurized modes. Furthermore, the improved disconnects utilized with this new glove design incorporated low torque bearings to minimize the forces associate to repeated rotations of the wrist. DESCRIPTION The complete S 103 5 ACES ensemble consists of a Helmet Assembly, Communications Carrier Assembly, Full Pressure Coverall Assembly, Glove Assemblies, and an Anti-G Suit Assembly. Reference Figure 2. HELMET ASSEMBLY - The helmet selected for use with the S 103 5 ACES is the standard S 1032 LES full pressure helmet. This non-conformal helmet was selected based upon its wide field of view, comfort, and virtual elimination of headborne weight. This helmet design was originally developed and qualified for flight under USAF sponsorship in the late 1970's, with one prototype system having accumulated over 1600 hours of usage flying in high altitude aircraft. Two minor changes were made to this helmet to accommodate specific NASA applications: 1) adjustable formed wire supports were installed under the helmet disconnect to provide helmet support and stability under varying "G" loads, and 2) a pressure switch was integrated with the oxygen delivery system and the communications circuitry to cut out the microphones during inhalation, thereby eliminating crew breathing noises from the communications network. This mie cut-out system had previously been developed for use with the S1030A Ejection Escape Suit (EES) which supported Shuttle orbital flight tests, STS-1 through STS-4. The non-conformal (full pressure) helmet provides a complete head and neck enclosure with no direct body contact above the shoulders. This design allows for unprecedented crew member comfort and (helmet related) stress reduction. A large, clear (moveable) pressure visor is affixed at the front of the helmet which provides excellent forward and peripheral vision. Side and rearward visibility is accomplished via manual helmet rotation and is facilitated by a helmet-coverall bearing affixed at the neck of the coverall. This helmet design further incorporates a full sunshade operated independently from the pressure visor, an anti- suffocation valve which permits an incapacitated crew member to draw ambient air into the breathing compartment when the emergency supply of oxygen has been expended, and high visibility tape on the outer shell to assist in search and rescue operations. COMMUNICATIONS CARRIER ASSEMBLY (CCA) - Communications are provided via a lightweight softgoods cap ("Snoopy Cap") worn by the crew member under the non- conformal helmet. In addition to providing dual earphone receivers and twin, flexible boom-mounted microphones, the communications carrier assembly incorporates head buffeting protection padding and a large mesh area located at the top to minimize heat build-up and improve crew member comfort. COVERALL ASSEMBLY - The S1035 ACES Coverall Assembly consists of a gas container layer, single ply restraint/exterior cover in the legs, and a link-net restraint/nomex exterior cover in the torso and arms. Gas Container - The Gas Container layer is fabricated from a lightweight, tri-laminate microporous film material which permits water vapor transmission (from inside to outside) while retaining gas (air) pressure and preventing the transmission of water from outside to inside. The selective permeability of this "breathable" gas container material allows for significant reduction in heat loading, thereby improving crew member comfort and reducing stress and fatigue. A pressure sealing closure (PSC) was selected for use on the S 103 5 gas container, based upon its highly rated performance after extensive flight test and operational evaluation performed previously with USAF S 1031 and S 1034 full pressure coveralls. Restraint/Exterior Cover - The Restraint/Exterior Cover Layer is fabricated from a single ply of high temperature woven fabric in the leg areas, and a two-ply combination of high temperature woven fabric and link-net in the torso and arm areas. The elimination of link-net restraint material in the legs resulted in reduced coverall weight and bulk, facilitated donning and doffing, simplified leg design and sizing adjustment, and improved maintainability. This was accomplished by combining restraint and exterior cover functions into a single layer of nomex fabric, which was patterned to provide adequate knee mobility and comfort in both pressurized and unpressurized modes. The main entry closure serves as both a pressure sealing and restraint closure (slide fastener). Hardware - Integrated at the top of the coverall assembly is a combination helmet bearing/disconnect ring, identical in design to that utilized on the S 1032 LES. Lightweight, low bulk glove disconnects are integrated at the sleeve cuffs which 699</page><page sequence="5">700 H CO ш Q_ &lt; ° ' v СО ' v ш ё it О ^ Q (О Ш Ш оО Z &lt; 2 Q &lt; ю со о т- (0 -I ш о о s // / / LTW ' ' 1 S fill 2|Ш li i£ ! if II ip 4 1 I 1 ¡1 J filili filmili S 2|Ш i£ -J if ip I 5 ¡I §8 ¡2 filmili fcčl§fc2^| Э StgSo -J §gog 5 °8 o£ Ji fcčl§fc2^| I Э 2&lt;íf Г ili 1 S| o£ «i Ji ä I t O o ä CL -I &lt; Z Ш o M §Й a 3 sis lis- ш£ i« к|ш t§ ¡u&lt;lií § ois ой« Ozi g« g¿ K Li- ntel §8 ¡u&lt;lií 1*¿ S SEE z4 щ -g SES S 83 go g¿ S5 |§ K ¡¡¡S Li- Í« îs|a Sí 1*¿ §5£ a S SEE ÏE£ |8S I щ SS -g 2«o SES S I ™g |t |§ Sg *§ Í« gS sii Sí il §5£ lis § a ¡g5¡ ÏE£ if |8S ī &gt;8 SS ¡¡а ¿ Si ™g sg 3° il |t Sg g| *§ Ц g5 gS S » 8§ ži£ » 0£ |g| :э&lt; (ООО i ī §s §sä - 1 &lt; § СО £a СО ii (/) 3° CQ li О Ш f 8= CÛ ц_ о &lt; 0£ :э&lt; (ООО - 1 &lt; СО СО (/) CQ О Ш CÛ ' ШМ //// I s a et 5 К z ш z S O O fcx о Q о &gt;¡ .

Bio-Medical Instrumentation Pass Thru (BIP) Hardware is also provided on the coverall leg, to permit medical instrumentation and monitoring of crew members during the launch and re-entry phases of flight. This hardware is similar in configuration to that utilized on the S 1032 LES, but has been reconfigured to be gas/pressure sealing for use with the S 103 5 (full pressure) coverall. Pressure Controls - The Oxygen Breathing Regulator, Exhalation Valves, Pressure Controller, and Relief Valve utilized on the S 103 5 ACES Coverall are identical to those used on the S 1032, but have been rescheduled to operate at 3.5 PSIA (241 HPa) as opposed to the S 1032 LES operational pressure of 2.8 PSIA (193 HPa). Additionally, the S 103 5 coverall incorporates an abbreviated ventilation system integrated internally to the gas container, which distributes vent air throughout the coverall, including the hand and leg areas. Vent ducts were integrated directly to the gas container via integral channels and snap fasteners so as to prevent snagging during donning and doffing, and to simplify assembly/disassembly. A (SI 032 style) helmet cavity/neck seal is also integrated with the ACES coverall, to provide for isolation of the helmet/breathing compartment from the remainder of the suit. Exhalation valve assemblies mounted in the breathing cavity insure a slightly positive pressure in the breathing compartment and provide for the exhaust of expelled breathing gasses into the coverall. GLOVE ASSEMBLIES - The S 103 5 Glove Assemblies were designed for improved comfort, mobility, and reduced bulk. This was achieved through outer glove pattern design changes incorporating a combination of both flat and tucked patterning. Furthermore, the fabrication of the glove bladder wrist, palm, and backhand sections from breathable materials allows for reduction in heat loading, thereby improving comfort, and reducing stress and fatigue. ANTI-G SUIT (AGS) ASSEMBLY - The S1035 ACES AGS incorporates lightweight, low bulk, high comfort materials, similar to those used in the fabrication of the S 103 5 coverall, and is configured similarly to the (USAF standard) "5 bladder" cut-away AGS. Connection to the standard AGS Pressurization and Control Assembly (PCA) is accomplished via a coverall pass-thru and hose interconnect. The coverall hose interconnect incorporates a self-sealing connector, thereby permitting the use of the coverall sans AGS. Additionally, the S 103 5 ACES AGS can be utilized sans coverall, via PCA integration directly to the AGS, for contingency operations. SUMMARY The S 103 5 ACES represents the latest state-of-the-art pressure suit system for emergency use in Space Shuttle operations. Its final configuration is the culmination of a dedicated design effort centered on the development of a simplified, lightweight, low bulk, improved comfort/ performance system which reduces crew member stress and fatigue. Primary design enhancements involved the use of a breathable material in the construction of the gas container to minimize bulk, reduce thermal load, and improve the overall comfort of the suited crew member. Complete redesign of the coverall legs was accomplished to eliminate the separate restraint and exterior cover layers typical of previous full pressure suit designs. Additional improvements were made through the use of a dual function pressure sealing closure which served to reduce bulk and eliminate the need for two, independently operated slide fasteners. Glove disconnect hardware was redesigned for improved donning/doffing, ease of operation and increased reliability. Finally, glove softgoods were redesigned to reduce thermal load, improve comfort, and maximize tactility and dexterity. Full scale development and qualification of the S 103 5 Advanced Crew Escape Suit was accomplished between 1990 and 1992. (Qualification Test requirements and results are considered beyond the scope of this paper, and may be considered as the subject for a separate presentation at a later date.) S1035 ACES production commenced in February of 1993, with the first unit being delivered to NASA in May 1994. The S 1035 ACES first flew aboard STS-68 in August of 1994, and will become the primary crew escape suit when the S 1032 Launch Entry Suit reaches the end of its service life beginning in late 1995. 701</page></plain_text>
