<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chapter 7 Re/Writing Science from the Margins Gaeli M. Hildebrand Discourses on appropriate genres in science Avoid questions of whether the conventions Inculcate a positivist view: an over-reliance, And ought to be the subject of contravention. There is no "scientific genre"- as a singularity, And to insist that school writing be in compliance With restrictive styles is to effectively guarantee Limitations on learning through writing in science. Discourse and Power Discourses are about what can be said, and thought, but also about who can speak, when, where and with what authority. -Stephen Ball,1 What is Poiicy? By using the concept of a discourse you can clearly see that in science teaching there are shared values and assumptions about whose voice is heard, what is taken for granted, what activities "naturally" lead to learn- ing science, and which writing genres are deemed appropriate for display- ing learning. But discourses are not benign patterns of language use; they are contestable areas, where power and hegemony are pervasive or, in competing discourses, disruptive. In this chapter I show you that the discourses that re/present2 science through writing are built upon foundations that can be legitimately challenged from several critical standpoints. I have deliberately broken the conventions of academic discourse in the framing of this chapter. By presenting the ways that some teachers are</page><page sequence="2">1 62 Re/Writing Science from the Margins re/writing science I have chosen to allow form to metaphorically indicate substance at various points. For example, I have written poetic interludes where it seems appropriate for me to do so. I do this as a deliberate project to disrupt the established practice of separating the discourses used in the arts from those used in the sciences (Charles Snow 1963). My purposes in using poetry are to evoke feelings, prod reflections, act politically, enjoy complexity, use metaphorical thinking, shift gear, and make connections. I use poetry despite being warned: "use the lin- guistic and stylistic resources of the poet or artist for scientific communi- cation, and you will not have standing as being scientific" (Jay Lemke 1995, 178). I am prepared to take the risk. I choose to play with the linguistic conventions in order to illustrate, by form as well as content, my point that our pedagogical practices in science teaching are informed by our belief systems, our frame of reference, our past experiences, our aes- thetic appreciation: our personal subjectivities. I have also formatted two short sections of this chapter as competing discourses: where the voices presented in the left margin, both literally and metaphorically, offer an alternative view to that generated through hegemonic "scientific" discursive text, exemplified by the right column. The shifting and multiple points of critique of the dominant mode of writing science are indicative of arguments for a re/writing of science. I have selected this series of snapshots as a representative collage showing reasons for, and consequences of, a re/writing of science, particularly as it is used with/in science classrooms. My hope is that new spaces may be opened up for critique of conventional writing practices in school sci- ence-spaces that may highlight not only that those marginalized by sci- ence can be mainstreamed when a re/view of science writing is facili- tated, but also that the process can simultaneously change the mainstream of learning science itself. ***** My perspectives on writing, learning, pedagogy, and science have grown out of who I am. I think it is therefore important to write myself into this story of why I think that disrupting the writing practices used in learning can be one means of facilitating the entry into science of those who have become disenfranchized from it.

Postscript: This chapter would be entirely poetic, But my long engagement in things scientific Makes it difficult to challenge the genre condoned When my expository writing skills are more finely honed. ***** The Politics of Disruption I see the world from a feminist frame of reference. When considering what I call the politics of disruption, it becomes clear that those who are in some way marginalized by established discourses and practices have a greater personal investment in fractures or interruptions: anyone con- structed as the "other." Marginalized as the other: Not white, Not male, Not heterosexual, Not speaking English as a first language, Not living in privileged neighborhoods. The other Has become the majority. ***** The Other also includes most of the world's teachers!</page><page sequence="5">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 165 But not all people who have become marginalized on the verandahs of science recognize that they have been restricted from having access to power. The way that discourses of power operate is to "domesticate" people into believing the dominant view, even when they are otherized themselves. Joan Wink argues that this support of hegemony occurs be- cause "those who are marginalized by the hidden processes" either "haven't taken time to reflect critically on themselves and their roles" or they see playing by the dominant rules "cynically, as the superhighway that must be used to get ahead" (Wink 1997, 43). I speak here from the perspective of one who explores the education- gender system (Jane Roland Martin, 1996) as a source of disenfranchizement from science and from power. Some writers who chal- lenge hegemonic science pedagogy speak from a perspective of disadvan- tage due to multiculturalism-education (e.g., Lynne Hewlett 1996; Peter Esterhuysen 1996; William Stanley and Nancy Brickhouse 1994; Mary Atwater 1994, 1996), while Paulo Freire (1968, 1985), Adriana Hernández (1997), and others who speak with anti-Colonialist voices, speak from perspectives of political and economic oppression. Each perspective has an investment in a disruption and a re/writing of the dominant discourse. I, like many others, have an ideological investment in providing a compet- ing "intelligible, plausible and fruitful" discourse (Peter Hewson 1996, 133; also 1981) as I seek a conceptual change in science educators' frame- works about the interactive science/pedagogy nexus. At times there appears to be an impenetrable barrier to change, built from the ideological position that current practice is the natural order. But interrupting and contesting dominant discourses, as history shows us, is always possible- even in science. "We must all, women and men, become aware of the power dynamics which are discouraging for women and, most importantly, work to change that atmosphere"; this implies that "our role as teacher educators and science educators requires that we inform ourselves on these issues, and actively pursue change" (Sharon Haggerty 1995, 7). As Haggerty argues, it is the responsibility of each of us to change the inequities of the current situation; we can no longer leave it to the marginalized groups, the victims of otherizing, to right the wrongs of hegemony. All science educators (researchers and practitioners alike) must become informed and act for change if we are not to be complicit in maintaining power for some and marginalization for most. Changing power on a widespread scale will require large numbers of teachers to take many small steps toward more liberator y pedagogies. Managing to interrupt and disrupt current practices in ways that are</page><page sequence="6">1 66 Re/Writing Science from the Margins manageable requires conceptualization of a new pedagogy, one that allows teachers to think ideologically while acting practically (see Hildebrand 1998) so that they can change restrictive writing and learning practices. Our discourse on pedagogy Is shaped by our frame of reference, Our ideological positioning. Through my feminist lens, I re/vision ways of learning science: By interrupting the hegemony Of science-as-usual, Of power-as-usual, Of pedagogy-as-usual, Of writing-as-usual. Changing power By Crossing borders. ***** Available and Allowable Genres In schools, science is re/presented through the discourse patterns of the texts that are available for students to read and allowable for them to write. I argue that the writing genres available for students, as consumers of science knowledge, construct science as positivist: a rational field of knowledge that inductively "discovers" through the so-called scientific method, a discourse that can be traced back to Frances Bacon (1561- 1626) and that was reinforced by Auguste Comte (1798-1857). The avail- able texts imply that there is a right way to write science: implicitly the texts model scientific writing, and explicitly they dictate writing models for the students to use, models that follow an inductive, empiricist view of science. Another contestation I have with the available texts in school science is that they construct science as masculine. This has been amply demon- strated as a worldwide phenomenon by many papers presented at the international Gender and Science and Technology (GASAT) conferences over the last two decades. Gender analyses of science textbooks, for vari- ous levels and subjects, show that science is portrayed as masculine through pictorial images; particular scientists mentioned; analogies and metaphors used; applications drawing on common male experiences; and the lan- guage used, such as the scientist as "he" (e.g., Judith Bazler and Doris Simonis 1989). Parallel analyses based on race or language background</page><page sequence="7">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 167 would, I predict, construct an image of science as an area of human en- deavor only undertaken by white English-speaking males. The writing genres usually allowable for students to produce in school science form, or construct, an image of what counts as science learning. When this writing consists entirely of non-narrative genres (note taking/ making, summaries, glossaries, reviews, calculations and problems, worksheets, and laboratory reports) then science is perceived as factual. On the matter of writing up the ubiquitous report, Clive Sutton says that "practising how to write a scientific report ... is a reasonable part of science education, but not every day!" (1992, 89). Using Hybrid Genres: Imaginative Writing Science does not suppress the imagination; much of it, like the arts, springs from the imagination. - Hanbury Brown, The Wisdom of Science. I use the term "imaginative writing" to include a spectrum of writing styles that draw on the imagination. This type of writing is most fre- quently called creative writing by science teachers in Victoria, Australia; but local English teachers associate that term with fiction/narrative and so I have chosen to use a new term. Under the broad term of imaginative writing, I incorporate any form of writing that involves a blend of the creative or the expressive with non-narrative genres. I have referred in the past to this writing in science as "non-conventional writing" (Hildebrand 1991), but I realize that it is not a term that will ever take off with teach- ers! Perhaps the most technically correct term would be "hybrid creative- scientific writing" because it would signify that the writing is an unusual blend of these written forms. There are advantages to not defining too precisely what I mean by imaginative writing in the context of secondary school science pedagogies. As Christina Hart points out, "from a reformer's point of view a certain amount of vagueness is a strength" (1995, 347) because if you define something too narrowly, many people will feel immediately excluded from the notion and turn away from a site of potential interruption and change. "By allowing a penumbra of ambiguity around the boundary of the inno- vation, interest groups of many kinds can see within it ways in which it might serve their different needs" (David Layton 1994, 32). For the purposes of this chapter I define imaginative writing as any hybrid, or blended, genres that use scientific and/or non-narrative genres (i.e., recounts, procedures, reports, explanations, expositions, discussions,</page><page sequence="8">1 68 Re/Writing Science from the Margins etc.) in conjunction with other fictional/narrative genres. This provides for a "penumbra of ambiguity" that may facilitate teachers' development of alternative writing tasks beyond those described here. In our postmodern world the existence of facts is very much contested: there are alternative beliefs about the world, no fixed certainties, no de- finitive truths, no facts. Patricia Rowell expresses her, and my, concern that "non-narrative writing is referred to as 'factual' writing" by many linguists and teachers. She points out that "the everyday usage of the word 'factual' as objective and uncontested information" is likely to con- tribute in schools to an image that such genres of writing are about the truth (1996, 30). "The portrayal of science as an accumulation of undis- puted 'factual' information is a setback for those who would characterize science as a human, interpretive activity" (1996, 32). The allowable genres for writing to learn science can be considerably expanded, as can the conception of science itself, under the rubric of imaginative writing. The following examples serve to open a window of possibilities: • Imagine you are a water molecule: describe five changes of state that you have recently gone through (anthropomorphic narrative). • Write a conversation between two electrodes in a Galvanic cell, describing what they see happening around them (conversational narrative with anthropomorphism). • Prepare a travel brochure advertising a trip to another planet (ad- vertisement). • You are a parachutist (dancer, basketballer, etc.); describe the forces acting on you throughout a jump (dance, game, etc.) (recount). • Write a poem describing a monotreme; write it in the shape of that animal (poetry). • Write an ode to the halogens (poetry). • Write an obituary for the last living tree (journalistic). Generic writing products that fall under this rubric include the following: • a wide range of narratives/stories (e.g., conversation, fantasy, fu- turistic/speculative fiction, mystery, adventure, romance, cartoon strip, detective story, and anthropomorphic narrative); • journals (e.g., autobiography, diary, travel journal); • letters (e.g., postcard home, letter to the editor, Dear Dorothy Dix letter, etc.);</page><page sequence="9">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 169 • poems (e.g., ballad, ode, limerick, cinquain); • lyrics (e.g., rap, rock, ballad); • scripts (e.g. , screenplay for a live production- may be video taped- and for a radio show- may be audiotaped); • advertisements (e.g., travel brochure, jingle, poster); • and journalistic writing (e.g., news, sports report, editorial, feature article, obituary). Further specific examples of imaginative writing are described by Leonie Gianello (1988); Sue Lewis and Anne Davies (1988); McClintock Collec- tive (1989); Liz James (1989); Gaell Hildebrand (1989); Sue Stocklmayer (1989); Vaughan Prain (1995); and Sue Avery and her colleagues (1996).

Hildebrand 1 71 Teachers' Voices on Hybrid Genres From a poststructural feminist standpoint, I argue that our thinking is shaped by the discursive patterns within which we feel confined to speak and/or write. By diversifying writing, we are freeing our students from the restrictive modes of thinking that science has imposed on its learners in the past. Brian Hand and Vaughan Prain argue that by using a range of writing practices, teachers can ensure that writing becomes an "active process of synthesizing and reprocessing knowledge," and this "extends the students" beyond the mere reproduction of knowledge common in conventional writing tasks (1996, 26). Anthropomorphic narratives When writing anthropomorphically, students adopt a human-type per- sona even though they are imagining they are a nonhuman object. Many anthropomorphic narratives follow this pattern: "You are a [fill in the blank]; describe what happens to you when you [blank]." Another form, frequently used by my collaborating teachers was: "You are a [blank]. Write a letter [or series of postcards] home from [blank] describing your journey through [blank]." The 'Postcards from a trip down the gut' gave me a way of knowing that they could picture themselves inside the gut, and from the food's point of view see the villae and know about the secretions and know whether they would have to be in a special suit to avoid acid in certain places, and things like that. (Yvette) You have to have a pretty solid understanding of the terms you're using, and a good understanding of the scientific principles you're talking about, so that you can write in an anthropomorphic way. (Rosemary) This notion of the power of anthropomorphic narratives to allow stu- dents to get inside the science concepts is a repeated message from these collaborating teachers. I think it helps students learn because the key is that they're identifying with a concept to use it as part of their story ... If you have to become part of some- thing then you're developing your understanding fairly closely. (Nicole) Mike Watts and Di Bentley give examples from different science classes where the teachers speak anthropomorphically in order to help their stu- dents understand concepts, for example, "the particles in a heated solid vibrate more and more until they cannot stand it any longer and they</page><page sequence="12">1 72 Re/Writing Science from the Margins melt" (1994, 88). Much of the metaphoric language used in science is anthropomorphic in origin, for example, "hydrophobic" molecules and "electrophiles." Clive Sutton reminds us that teachers should feel com- fortable using anthropomorphism as "there is surely no need for us to be apologetic about forms of expression which resemble those used by sci- entists in their creative effort" (1996, 5). Watts and Bentley argue that an increased use of anthropomorphic writing "would increase the 'human' appeal of science and reduce the alienation felt by young women in sci- ence," and they urge teachers to "exploit [the] pedagogic potence" of anthropomorphism to help sustain girls in science (1994, 83). Journalistic writing A variety of journalistic forms, from news reports to obituaries, have been used by some of the teachers in my study. The teachers frequently using journalistic genres as a mechanism for linking students' social worlds with their science learning. They really love talking about things that are of immediate impact to them, things that affect their daily lives, and everybody knew somebody who had some [medi- cal] condition, or they had it themselves and that seemed to interest them. And I thought, "well, OK, why don't I get them to explore something that interests them?" They then had to interview someone about their condition. I thought it was a good way of bringing in technology as well: How's the condition managed? What tests are done to diagnose the condition? How does it affect the family? The lifestyle? They had to bring in a whole lot of issues like that into their writing. (Katie) Only in Katie's case did I hear a prewriting discussion about using some specific strategies of a journalist to capture an audience and hence to deconstruct the ways journalistic writing can be used to persuade: "I also get them to do a media analysis. We analyse an article from New Idea [a women's magazine] and from The Age [a newspaper] and it has to do with someone's condition. . . . We talk about the tools that the writer uses to engage an audience and how the message is being communicated. . . . and it makes them much more aware of how journalists operate." Scripts Some teachers associated writing with another activity in the topic. For example, some used role play and dramatic representations to help stu- dents learn science concepts, and the scripts that were written for perfor- mance are another form of imaginative writing. The performances may simply be for their own class or they may be as extensive as the produc-</page><page sequence="13">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 1 73 tion level required for the annual "Science Drama Awards" run by the Science Teachers' Association of Victoria (STAV). I also involve drama in there because when we do the improvisations with stu- dents I also get them to write them down in a dramatic form. So they do script writing for me in that way. (Anastasia) Poetry and Songs This is a cinquain poem of mine: Science, Powerful, creative, evolving, Challenging, exploring, thinking, learning, Writers actively constructing meaning, Science. The succinctness is appealing to several teachers who mentioned it as a useful vocabulary-building tool that is also a nonthreatening task for their students. I love those little poems- the cinquain poems. Because they really seem to knock it on the head: it might be the concept of change or flight, or something. It allows the kids the chance to creatively think about the words that describe that concept without having to go into a long explanation. ... I think it's very freeing to have an opportunity to discuss and explore what you understand by a science concept through just picking out some other words and writing a short poem. (Jeff) Katie encourages her students to write songs (poems set to music): "They do a song in year 7, working in groups, and they've each got four ele- ments. So they've got to do research first. . . . Then I set them the task and I say to them, "OK, you're going to be making up a song from this information, that you're going to perform." . . . We discuss, "what might people want to know about these elements?" We write up a list of ques- tions and then they go to it and they find the answers [and] eventually they do produce something reasonable together. And I've got some vid- eos there of them actually performing it. . . . and they don't particularly recognize that they're writing verses, or poetry." In this case, as in many others, the written product created provides the students with a purpose for their learning and acts as a motivational device. Fantasy- touched by realism Many of the tasks that teachers set are of the type used by Yvette when she asked her students to write about a frictionless world: "They had to</page><page sequence="14">1 74 Re/Writing Science from the Margins write what that would mean to them in terms of explaining four situations where they'd normally rely upon friction to actually do a movement. So they had to research what the thing was that they would do and how friction would help them normally function, such as walking across the floor in their bare feet, and then comparing that to a situation that they could imagine where there was no friction . . . only by them showing me what would happen if friction wasn't there did I know that they knew what friction was." As Yvette explains, sometimes the absence of a scien- tific concept can only be possible in a fantasy world, and yet its absence can become a stimulus for thinking more deeply about its presence. Some Teachers' Reasons Writing with imagination May lead to an early cessation Of exclusions and frustrations Through a contestation Of the dislocation and alienation Of several generations Arising from the mystification of Science. ***** All but one of the collaborating teachers in my project began using imaginative writing in their science classes because of an active interest in the notion of an inclusive curriculum. In such a model, teachers' efforts are focused on delivering their teaching in such a way as to include all students and not alienate sectors of their classes. In particular, the three groups who were deliberately targeted- at least initially- by these teach- ers were: • girls; • students whose heritage, or family, language is not English; • students whose academic levels were not high and who were gener- ally perceived as alienated from schooling in general, and from sci- ence in particular. Teachers' Reasons for Using Imaginative Writing Conventional ( Voices in the Left Margin) Science Writing "We started because we were working with Rowena, and as the object the Special Ed people. We were focusing on language moves on the and that started us off. It began more as an ESL [English frictionless</page><page sequence="15">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 1 75 as a Second Language] thing, I think, and then from surface it that we looked at it from the girls' perspective." (Maria) remains at a . . . "I have a very challenging context for this, because I was photosynthesis working with [a named suburb] kids, teaching science to involves light students who came from a variety of dislocated backgrounds acting as a [and] who had all sorts of social and economic constraints catalyst so that . . . that had impeded their educational history. So for some of them writing anything was a challenge let alone the traditional approaches to writing up a science experiment. So I was really challenged in a major way, and I think that had a powerful influence on me . . . And obviously writing was really powerful and the diversity of it [pause] there was a whole range of ways of opening up writing styles." (Elaine) "Well, I think actually, I first came across it in my very early while the red years of teaching when I read an article published in Readers blood cell carries Digest , and it was relating to body systems and it was done the oxygen around in a really imaginative way . . . And I just thought 'what a the hemoglobin good idea'. [But] when I first started teaching, the convention acts as . . . was to write formal 'prac.' reports and science was a pretty formal subject. I think if you did something like that, and I'm looking at 20 to 30 years ago, you would've been laughed out of the place, and that wouldn't have been regarded as science, because it just wasn't done . . . The first time I used it properly was when I attended a McClintock4 in-service and since then I've used it consistently." (Michael) "I was just thinking of that poster with Einstein that's up in oxidation occurs the chem laboratory: that 'imagination is more important at the anode in than knowledge.' I guess what we'd encourage kids to do the cell because would be to start thinking, and not stop thinking, about stuff that they come across in the lab. And not to think about science as a collection of 'facts' that haven't changed and won't change. And to think that it's more of a dynamic process- and I think by doing things that encourage kids to write and think and talk divergently, by using kids talking to each other about their work, by using creative writing, by using role play, we're encouraging them to move away from the stereotyped image of what science has been, and to think about it in a more evolutionary way." (Alex) "I think that probably most good scientific discoveries, the common most particularly important ones, have been because structural someone has crossed a barrier- because something has characteristics appeared to be what it ought not to be, or because mean that . . . somebody different has looked at a result with different eyes, or somebody has shown a biological specimen to a chemist, or whatever." (Yvette) . . .</page><page sequence="16">1 76 Re/Writing Science from the Margins "My original premise when I started teaching science the aperture was that 'science is for all', it isn't just for people who generates were going to be studying at university or whatever. I've diffraction always thought that science is empowering for people . . . patterns that can That's the whole point of this: I'm trying to make things more accessible." (Katie) "We learn through connecting to previous experience, the third sample and I think science has really disconnected from all of was rendered that, and so it really built, unwittingly, on a masculine view unusable and it of the world. I think we've been breaking that down, and was discarded so opening that up, and now it comes out in the way that we that it . . . teach . . . [and] the history of science has been much more extraction and disconnection and the learning of abstract knowledge and ideas. So I think it's trying to challenge and extend and diversify the meaning of science." (Elaine) "It sounds ridiculous but it was almost a breakthrough conventional in my teaching. Seeing that some people need to learn current in that way, but not everyone does, and seeing that you flows towards it, had to give that opportunity to some kids to be able to do while actual it, to be able to learn it. There was no point in me standing current flows up at the board and talking about this sort of stuff to some away from the kids. That was never ever going to be a way I would help them get some ideas into their heads." (Sandy) "I think this is really where it shows up that we've failed determined by in the old way that science was taught; it's the most clear observing the indication that it didn't work. Because we cannot interpret rate of decrease what things mean for someone when they ask us. 'You're of the absorption clever, you did science, you should understand this.' How many times have you been in that situation? And you haven't had a clue, because your knowledge is so compartmentalized, and you also aren't good at verbalizing what you know? If you haven't practiced it in the science classroom and you've just stuffed in all this knowledge, in little bits, it's not going to squish around and come out as a nice cohesive message years later." (Chris) Writing in/forms Science David Locke (1992) sees "science as writing" because the key tangible artifacts of science are the written traces left behind by scientists. The interactions between science and writing are two-directional. Writing is both the record of science practice, and writing shapes the discourse of</page><page sequence="17">Gaeli M.

He recognized that papers con- struct a fraudulent view of science, clearly dissonant with the processes of science and its knowledge production projects. Medawar said, "hypoth- eses arise by guesswork" and they are most certainly "not of logic" (re- printed in Bernard Dixon 1989, 173). Medawar also argued that "the scientific paper is a fraud in the sense that it does give a totally misleading narrative of the process of thought that goes into the making of scientific discoveries. The inductive format of the scientific paper should be dis- carded" (quoted in Dixon 1989, 175).</page><page sequence="18">1 78 Re/Writing Science from the Margins David Locke argues that while many scientists genuinely believe that "their language does not much matter, that it is merely the empty vessel into which the content of their scientific thought is poured," this is not the case (1992, ix). Locke argues that previous discourse analyses of the writings of the poet/author and the scientist have concentrated on the differences, trying to "otherize" the writing styles, seeking a legitimation of one form as superior or more powerful. He meticulously deconstructs the oppositions that supposedly underpin each form, showing that their similarities are greater than their differences. For example, literature and scientific writing both use similar persuasive tactics in an attempt to con- vince the reader of a particular point of view. Locke also illustrates the expressive and imaginative side of scientific writing, its artfulness and affect ivity, and exposes the way it indicates the social milieu of the writer(s). Locke challenges the notion that scientific language should retain its "privi- leged position as pure functional notation, as mere shorthand records" because of the literary devices that clearly exist in the writing (1992, viii). In Locke's analysis of the original letter to Nature on the structure of DNA (Jim Watson and Frances Crick 1953), he showed how the tech- niques of literature were well used. For example, understatement was used to imply, but not state, claims: a clever use of this literary tool that highlights a point. Crick later discussed how their first nine-hundred-word letter was "brief and restrained" but that he did talk Watson into adding the famous understatement: "It has not escaped our notice that the spe- cific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material" (from the Nature paper, cited in Crick 1988, 66). Crick said this sentence was a "compromise" between his own desire to make a "claim to priority," being the first to notice and not wanting others to think they had been "too blind to see" the possibil- ity, and Watson's "periodic fears that the structure might be wrong and that he had made an ass of himself" (Crick 1988, 66). This concurs with Bruno Latour's observation that when authors are "on dangerous ground, understatement proliferates" (1987, 55). These scientists were well aware of the rhetoric that they built into their letter. I also draw your attention to the use of the first person in this important example of scientists' writing. Brian Martin outlines how scientists selectively present their methods and results to support their conclusions and use (carefully embedded) emotive language to persuade. He thinks that scientific authors "do not make balanced analysis, and do not present results in a neutral manner," and they do push a line (1979, 25). He contrasts two papers (one pub- lished in Science , the other in Nature ) on gaseous emissions and the</page><page sequence="19">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 1 79 ozone layer to show how the choice of words and turns of phrase indicate the underlying ideology of the authors: one calls for action on environ- mental degradation, the other defends the economics of current prac- tices. He notes, for example, "ozone shield" compared with "ozone layer"; "permitting the harsh radiation" compared with "increasing the ultravio- let radiation reaching the planetary surface"; "burden of NO" compared with "amounts of NO"; "threats to stratospheric ozone" compared with "interact with, and so attenuate" ozone levels (Martin 1979, 36). This is but one example of how scientists use words to persuade through trigger- ing emotional responses in their readers. Bruno Latour agrees that the distinction between scientific literature "and the rest, is not a natural boundary" (1987, 62). Latour says it is merely the complexities of the way the social purposes of the author are realized that make the scientific paper appear different. When discussing the writings of "science in the making" Latour says: "the more we get into the niceties of scientific literature, the more extraordinary it becomes. It is now a real opera" (1987, 53). The "cast of characters" includes all the cited authorities, the "crowds of people mobilised by the references," (1987, 53). The props are the experimental tools, the heroes are the authors, the villains are the problems encountered and solved. More than thirty years since Medawar's exposé, the scientific paper is still taken as the definitive piece of scientific writing: the standard. Yet there are many other styles of writing produced by scientists: letters (to each other and to journals), posters at conferences, jottings and unformed notes on their own ideas and other people's work, email messages, grant applications, and textbooks. Through writing in multiple genres, scien- tists illustrate that the complexities of so-called scientific writing are great and that any attribution of a unitary set of practices is misleading. Despite such deconstructions of scientific writing, there are linguists (e.g., Michael Halliday and Jim Martin 1993; Charles Bazerman 1988) who still ana- lyze it in such a way that they construct scientific writing- as they perceive it- as worthy of holding a "privileged position" (Locke 1992, viii) for all communication in and about science. Writing forms Science Writing forms (shapes, defines) science because what is published pro- vides the parameters, the paradigms, and hence the possibilities within which scientists work. Frances Bacon, a nonscientist, wrote a science fiction story, called "The New Atlantis", about an ideal society on a remote</page><page sequence="20">1 80 Re/Writing Science from the Margins island (Brown 1986). In it Bacon claimed superiority for empirical science's knowledge production process based on its supposed method-the use of direct observation and experimentation and the induction of general laws- and its powers of prediction and technological control. 5 Bacon's hypothetical scientific method is still described in many introductory sci- ence textbooks today, as if it represents practice. I draw your attention to the underlying metaphor relating to an empire embedded within the con- cept of "empirical" itself, clearly signaling and claiming power for such an interpretation of science. "The New Atlantis" is an example of a piece of (fictional) writing that still forms the practice of science. It does so because many scientists actually perceive that they do proceed by induction, un- covering the pre-existing laws of nature as described in Bacon's idealistic method. But "paradoxically, the Baconian view of science is not based on empirical observation of what scientists do" (Max Charlesworth 1982, 8). Particular writings form fields of research, through reinforcing "nor- mal" science or by creating a Kuhnian revolution and paradigm shift. For example, the Watson and Crick (1953) DNA letter shaped a new field, giving it direction and purpose: trying to manipulate DNA's "copying mechanism." Bacon's idealized model of a scientific method has ultimately led to the construction of positivist Western science as a major regime of truth in our society. The highly valorized position that hegemonic science holds has led to the creation of a mystique surrounding it, parallel to that which previously surrounded the hegemonic truth generators of previous centu- ries: mythology and theology. Richard Lewantin, esteemed biologist, coined the phrase "physics envy" to explain the condition many biologists suffer from when they try to reduce their work to simple cause and effect rela- tionships governed by mathematical laws, like classical physics has done (David King 1996, 39). This reductionism has also had an impact, up until recently, on the methodologies deemed appropriate in the social sciences and the consequent dominance of positivist research designs in education. In this sense, research in all fields of Western thought has suffered from physics envy with its controlling "positivist gaze" of scientific meth- odology. I use this term as analogous to the concept of the "male gaze" in cultural studies, a gaze that has the power to shape women's social behav- ior, because the positivist gaze has shaped all research in Western society while it has been used as the measuring stick against which all other research methodologies have been judged. Hegemonic science thus shapes</page><page sequence="21">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 181 our view of what counts as knowledge in any field. Bacon's advocation of particular approaches to inquiry as the purest form of truth generation has cast a long positivist shadow not only across science itself, but also across all of the social sciences as well. Two decades ago Ruth Wallsgrove reminded us that "you can't be rational if you pretend that everything you do is rational; if you don't examine and come to terms with what you feel, your feelings will interfere anyway, but in a hidden and uncontrollable way" (1980, 235). The cast of characters who have deconstructed examples of scientific writing in ways that align with my ideological positioning include Brian Martin (1979), Bruno Latour (1987), Roger Shepard (1988), Jone Rymer (1988), Alan Gross (1990), and David Locke (1992). Each of these au- thors has not only shown how scientific writing shares techniques with literature and how scientists do write with passionate voices, but also shown how scientific writing forms the very science that it supposedly reports. In their writing, authors' paradigms and ideologies are exposed, their political intentions of persuasion are clear, and their desire for recog- nition is put on the table. "Scientists are tellers of tales, creative writers who make meaning and who choose the ways they go about doing so" (Jone Rymer 1988, 244). Writing informs Science From Isaac Newton's (1687) Principia , through Charles Darwin's (1859) Origin of the Species , and Albert Einstein's (1905) paper on the "Spe- cial Theory of Relativity", to Watson and Crick's (1953) DNA letter, sci- ence has been informed by the publication of scientists' writing. Through reading others' work, scientists have been able to "stand on the shoul- ders" of those who came before them (as Newton allegedly said). Scientists use writing to inform their work, but little of the informing is uncontested (Hildebrand 1996). For example, the competing discourses of religion and science have resulted in court cases and contestations over the school science curriculum as a result of Darwin's work. History tells us that it took thousands of molecular biologists more than forty years to unravel the "possible copying mechanism" so cleverly alluded to by Watson and Crick (1953), and the current social debates surrounding the ethics and dangers of recombinant DNA technologies are an example of people outside the community of practitioners influencing scientists through public critique and challenge- and, perhaps, through control of practice via le- gal strategies.</page><page sequence="22">1 82 Re/Writing Science from the Margins Science itself has also always been informed by imagination within writing through the use of metaphorical devices, allegories, and imagery to push out the boundaries. People such as James Clerk Maxwell, Michael Faraday, Friedrich Kekulé, Albert Einstein, and Nikola Tesla have been well documented as sources of inspiration for others (e.g., Roger Shepard 1988; Bernard Dixon 1989, David Locke 1992; Alan Gross 1990; Clive Sutton 1996). Scientists' writing abounds with creative imagery that has led to new ways of thinking about our world. Cognitive Effect of Writing Imaginatively to Learn Science Imaginative writing Involves creative thinking, Synthesis and active researching. Showing that you can Appropriate the language Of power. Pushing the boundaries of genres, Combining, blending, bending. Showing the teacher more than they knew About you And your constructions of science. ***** All of my collaborating teachers claim that the hybrid genres of imagi- native writing can support deep and meaningful learning (in contrast to rote and surface learning) when used as either a learning activity or an assessment tool. These teachers argue that imaginative writing tasks can be used to • identify alternative conceptions; • learn science concepts; • synthesize science concepts; • transform learning into students' words; • aid memory work; • and demonstrate learning- to teachers and to students themselves. Teachers' Claims on the Cognitive Benefits of Using Imaginative Writing Conventional ( Voices in the Left Margin) Science Writing • Identify alternative conceptions: as the object moves "It's one of the quickest ways to pick up misconceptions on the frictionless</page><page sequence="23">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 1 83 the kids have about anything. You find out if they haven't surface it remains got a clue about this, or they haven't made the connection at a . . . between this and that." (Sandy) • Learn science concepts: photosynthesis These teachers argue that the act of writing is a powerful involves light learning process- imaginative writing was not seen merely acting as a catalyst as an exercise to reveal prior learning, but also to provide so that for learning. "I use it because I think a lot of the learning happens when they're doing their story." (Michael) • Synthesize science concepts: the third sample was "I think it helps them make more connections, a lot more rendered unusable connections, and think differently about the information and it was discarded that they've got. Not just put it in a little box and process so that it . . . it as a little chunk of isolated information." (Rosemary) • Transform learning into students' words: while the red blood "It really gets the kids to internalize [ideas] and understand cell carries the what it's all about . . . They can't fool you in creative writing xygen around tasks . . . They have to re-organize it- they can't just take othe hemoglobin information and transcribe it . . . They have to put it in acts as . . . their own words and re-work ideas. They have to be able to understand the information in their head to be able to write the story." (Sandy) "Doing it this way, kids can't just get a book or CD-ROM and copy stuff . . . Because, they can find the information all right, but then putting it in their own words, they find really difficult, and I think the creative writing makes them do it in their own words." (Michael) • Aid memory work: oxidation occurs "It's difficult to learn 'facts' and if they can do it in a fun at the anode in the way they can associate it with something then it stays . . . cell because a couple of kids said to me the other day 'we still remember those element songs from year 7' and they're in year 9 now." (Katie) "I think they will remember, three years later, the imaginative writing they did, whereas they won't remember from day to day what notes they took from a board." (Nicole) • Demonstrate learning- to teachers: the common "I think they like having other opportunities to show structural</page><page sequence="24">1 84 Re/Writing Science from the Margins what they understand. Some students find it an easier way characteristics to show what they understand than other methods: often mean that . . . kids who hate tests really do well at a creative writing response." (Sandy) • Demonstrate learning- to students themselves: the aperture "For a start they have to acknowledge they don't under- generates diffraction stand and I think that's a big thing. That's where the real patterns that can learning comes in: when they find out what they don't know and they have to go and find out more." (Rosemary) "It was a real discriminator for them: of the bits they could understand and the bits they were very confused on. I've found it's one of the most effective things I've ever used for kids- for themselves- to really see if they understand what's going on." (Sandy) Playing with Language Desire For pleasure in the pursuit Of learning. Fun, In students' words: "not boring," Motivates. Engagement Is attention focused on ideas: Flow. Learning, Has pleasure at the heart Of it all. ***** Many of those who advocate the use of imaginative writing as a femi- nist practice promote a sense of playfulness in learning through writing (e.g. Leonie Gianello 1988; Sue Lewis and Anne Davies 1988; McClintock Collective 1989; Liz James 1989; Gaell Hildebrand 1989; Sue Stocklmayer 1989). The concept that it is permissible to have fun in a science lesson is not new; neither is the idea of having fun through playing with writing. "It seems likely that play with written language can help children develop greater awareness and understanding of how it can be manipulated- of what can be done with it and of what they can do with it. . . . Playing with</page><page sequence="25">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 185 the processes and forms of writing seems likely to give children a sense of ownership" (Joan McLane 1990, 312). McLane describes play as allow- ing students to stretch their learning and feel as though they "were already competent," or, in Lev Vygotsky's words: "Play creates a zone of proxi- mal development of the child. In play a child always behaves beyond his [sic] age, above his daily behaviour; in play it is as though he were a head taller than himself" (Vygotsky 1978, 102). Some students would be familiar with playfulness in popular books such as Joanna Cole's (1989) "Magic School Bus" series- and its Microsoft multimedia reincarnations on CD-ROM. A teacher who heard a presenta- tion by Cole, as part of a program supporting the integration of science with language arts, reacted: "Joanna Cole represents all that is good about combining science and literature. She exemplifies how naturally they fit together" (Linda Baker and Wendy Saul 1994, 1029). Cole uses hybrid imaginative writing genres. We ought to remember that not only do young children like to play, but so too do secondary students and their teachers. Play amongst science education researchers can trigger frac- tures and paradigmatic shifts by slipping into the gaps in the dominant discourse of writing to learn science. As Jay Lemke exhorts, "Make trouble. Play!" (1995, 184). Part of the pleasure of it for the kids, is that it allows them to have a bit of fun. So they can be imaginative and creative in what they're doing . . . It's not one of those strategies where you have to drag the kids along, kicking and screaming, to get it done . . . They really engage with the task; they really enjoy that opportu- nity to look at it in another way. (Sandy) One teacher explained that those students who expect science to be a dull and/or difficult subject are surprised that they enjoy themselves. Some kids enjoy it so much that they actually think they're not doing science. It's so different to what they thought that you did in science that this mustn't be science, because this is actually good. (Pat) Her comment is quite a revealing one and a sad commentary on hege- monic pedagogy in science. A new both/and relationship emerges: imagi- native writing means students can both learn in a science class and have fun. Disturbances, fractures and interruptions to science Mean thinking beyond the old pedagogies of compliance, Remembering those whose science lessons were for nought</page><page sequence="26">1 86 Re/Writing Science from the Margins Creating contestations in what and how Science could, And should, Be taught. * * * * * Power and Ownership of Scientific Language You can't learn properly unless you take on a new language. But I think the trouble with science definitions is not knowing what the words mean, but it's that language style: it's that third person, all pervasive language style that seems to define it . . . Everyone doesn't want to come out of science with restrictions on the boundaries of how you write. I've been amazed how nearly everyone [who teaches science] feels so constrained by the formal language that we learnt in science and we haven't been able to throw it off. It has really felt like a big clamp that has shut you down in how you express yourself. (Chris) Along with myself there are now many other science and language educators who agree that to use on/y the supposedly scientific-factual genres in learning science is to re/present hegemonic Western science. For example, Clive Sutton advocates that teachers ought to "present the language of science as a human product . . . using an interpretative voice" themselves, putting "everyday expressions and technical language to- gether," and they should also "encourage the interpretative voice" in their students so that "it is clear that language is a medium for conversation about ideas" (1996, 13). If students are to become active in the discourse of power/knowledge, then there must be a gradual shift from where they are now (users of everyday language) to where they may choose to be (immersed in science practice or critique). This is reinforced by Yvette, who uses imaginative writing as a bridge from everyday language into scientific language with her students: "If they don't have the technical expressions they're powerless really. I mean they sound like bunnies, in their language, and I think that they would go on, and they would feel that it was all right to speak about scientific concepts in slang or everyday language." Sutton concludes that extensive use of scientific language perpetuates an image of detachment of knowledge from people, and he advocates that "ordinary human language, including narratives," would be a better language for learning and for seeing how scientists work (1996, 17). Jay Lemke's (1987) assertion that the use of scientific terminology is interpreted as a "claim to power" and that people come to accept that "superior" people master it is related to the concern of many feminist science educa-</page><page sequence="27">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 187 tors, a concern that science is directly linked to hegemonic forms of mas- culinity through, among other means, the discursive practices associated with its learning and teaching (e.g., Nancy Tuana 1989; Sue Rosser 1990; Sandra Harding 1991). The close link between language and learning was clear in all of these teachers' thinking, and some teachers recognized the power that comes with ownership of, and control over, scientific lan- guage. It gives them a sense of power, in a way, that they can actually use that language. (Sandy) Other teachers went further, recognizing that science is directly linked with power through its language and that skill in control- ling scientific language can allow some people to manipulate others. As Katie explains, "I think there is a bit of academic snobbery too, in a lot of the so-called scientific language. There's more than just using the scien- tific language: there's politics and power at play there . . . it's the politics of language . . . You read scientific papers and you sometimes wonder whether or not they're being deliberately obscure. I sometimes think sci- entists are showing off to each other . . . You can manipulate people and you've got the upper hand, in a sense, if you can manipulate the language of science." Chris, in recognizing that science is linked to power through its lan- guage, warned that those people who allow girls to use simple language, while skilling up boys, are perpetrating a severe injustice: "To use the language of science is to call in power. And we're doing girls a disservice if we don't actually teach the "truth" of how to survive in the science world, and the boys would pick up that jargon and use it, and be powerful in the end, and girls wouldn't. So I think it's important to use both every- day and scientific language. One is a stepping stone to the other." Directly linked to the power of scientific language is the issue of owner- ship of it: students who feel they own the language are not intimidated by its power. Providing opportunities for students to feel that scientific lan- guage belongs to them is seen as a strength of imaginative writing. As Sam explains, "It's very effective for concepts and processes [as] students are involved in it themselves, it gives them ownership." Control of the language of science is encouraged by a sense of playful- ness: "For the mainstream student, it breaks down the fairly severe image they have of science, the remote image that they have . . . It's the knowl- edge that it can belong to them, it doesn't have to belong to the people in the laboratories . . . They then feel they can cope with it, and understand it. It's not precious-they can use it. They can feel in control of it. Whereas before, if you heaped this foreign information on them, they didn't want</page><page sequence="28">1 88 Re/Writing Science from the Margins it, they don't want to know about it: it's just too hard. They shut off . . . From what I can understand most kids are not comfortable with science information. They think it is boring and not of their world. This makes it personal and says "it's OK to jiggle this around." They feel that it is so structured that they're not supposed to jiggle it." (Rosemary) The notion that students can "jiggle" the language of science is not usually found in hegemonic pedagogy. Another way to show students the ways power and language interact is to use Katie's deconstruction model. This highlights the ways science is written about in the popular media and illustrates techniques for students to use: "Those who can manipulate the language of science are in a very powerful position because you can ex- clude people, and bamboozle them with facts, and whatever. But if people can become more critical of what's being said and how it's being said, perhaps they can then look beyond the obvious" (Katie). Explicitly show- ing students how others can "bamboozle" them with science is foregrounding to students the way texts work in practice. It is teaching them to "read the world" and not just the word (Joan Wink 1997) from a critical pedagogy position. These teachers are trying to enable their stu- dents to critique and challenge the science in their lives so that they will not be intimidated by people like journalists, doctors, and politicians. When asked if students should write only in the ways that scientists do, Elaine's response was unequivocal: "Clearly not. We're talking about chang- ing the whole world, changing the way science is conceptualized, taught and popularized. I think part of that is breaking into the notions of what writing about science is. I think that some of the writers out of popular literature have taken the creative initiative and are doing all those sorts of things. There are lots of places where it's happening already and we were behind, putting it into the classroom." The writing genres used for learning science do not need to be congru- ent with those that scientists use because of the fundamentally different social purposes of the two projects: learning science and reporting sci- ence. These teachers worked on the premise that science teaching and learning should deliberateli j utilize different language practices, including a wide variety of writing forms, because of the accessibility of the concep- tual development that they provide. As Katie describes, "There's a vast difference between what you're expecting people to produce [in science] later on, and what kids are interested in, in years 7 and 8. I think you would be doing the kids a disservice if you had a particular thing in mind- this is the scientific way of writing, "this is the best way" ... If we try and sausage kids into this idea that you on/y write reports for science, and</page><page sequence="29">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 189 that's the way that you learn science, then it's really narrowing and I think that if you decide that's the way to go, you'd be turning girls off." As Elaine said, teachers "transmit the culture of science" through their classroom practices. Richard Coe, a linguist, argues that "genres are . . . important factors in the social construction of orientations, paradigms, ideologies, world views, and cultural perspectives" (1994, 184). He says that genres can be seen as "fossilized rhetorical processes" and for them to work they must "achieve desired effects" (184). I agree with Coe; the "tyranny of genre" exists when there is an unreflective and formulaic ap- plication of narrow genres. Coe sees a danger here because to "help someone learn a generic form," such as a laboratory report, without also helping them become critically aware of its effect, "may subject them to the genre rather than empower them" (1994, 188). For me this means that in school science we need to be reflective on what the effects of particular genres might be. We need to ask questions of ourselves: What are the social purposes of writing in science classes? Why do we insist on laboratory reports being written in this particular style? What other writing forms might better achieve the effect we desire? Aviva Freedman and Peter Medway argue that there are two grounds for reappraising the ways genres have been advocated in schooling. First, genres do not simply "display the disciplinary knowledge" of a subject like science, but also "enact the social relations of science" in classrooms- relations that have served a "filtering function that systematically denied legitimacy" for "females or working class students" in the past (Freedman and Medway 1994, 14). "The perpetuation of the genre contributes to the perpetuation of those forms of power and exclusion" (14). Patricia Rowell concludes that "writing in school science could be used to move in multiple directions among discourses" rather than constrain- ing students to write within set genres all the time (1997, 47). She argues that "if multiple roles for writing in science are recognized, the taken-for- granted communication function, tied to transmission of information . . . could be dislodged from its predominant position" (1997, 48). By explicating the purposes of conventional writing styles and genres, and providing models beyond these, the teachers reported here are chal- lenging the hegemony of conventional writing practices. They recognize that boundary policing of the right way to write science serves to marginalize many students beyond the borders of science.

Imaginative writing re/presents science and pedagogy As contestations to hegemony. ***** Creativity in Science These teachers hold a belief that science is a creative process and that by encouraging creativity they are making an important contribution to de- veloping problem-solving skills. Admittedly the practice of science sometimes can be tedious, but you're looking at people who are ultimately trying to solve problems. And you're not going to solve a problem unless you're going to be creative and innovative about it, in some way. (Sandy) Laura argues strongly that science should not be portrayed as a catalogue of facts but as a dynamic field changed by creativity: "It gets them think- ing more creatively, rather than looking at science as a fact-finding type of subject or discipline. They come to realise that a lot of hypotheses are not necessarily "fact" for long, they're always being revamped. To believe that science is just so wholesome and truthful and without any creativity is, I think [pause] that's a sin!" (Laura). Laura's strength of view is evident in her language. Alex also links training in creativity to the dynamic nature of science, expressing a desire that one day creative students, like hers, will be able to change science: "The way we think about things now may not be the way we think about them in the future: and possibly that might happen because people are encouraged to think about them differently, in school." In trying to live their philosophy of science teaching and learning, these teachers attempt to innovate and vary their teaching strategies: "We try and teach science creatively, as far as possible" (Katie). Overcoming the noncreative stereotype of science and its teachers is a concern of some of these teachers- not only with their students but also</page><page sequence="31">Gaeli M. Hildebrand 191 with their colleagues. Angela's comment highlights the notion that teach- ers who use imaginative writing are creative and resourceful themselves: "This is my whinge, OK. We still have English Literature people here at school, who think that we all belong in a box over on this side of the school, who only think of E=mc2. And that really is upsetting because most of us are pretty well read in many things . . . We all bounce pretty good ideas off each other when we have a meeting and we all have ideas to make it creative. Because we're NOT the boring types in the labs any more." One downside that Katie mentioned was this: "It gets to the stage where they just don't want to listen to "chalk and talk" any more." As "chalk and talk" has long been associated with hegemonic pedagogy, it is not surprising to me that these students reject it once they've experienced creative aspects of a more enabling pedagogy (Hildebrand 1998). Changing Pedagogy Science teachers Thinking ideologically While acting practically Re/constructing a pedagogy that valorizes, Moving towards one that problematizes Science. ***** As Walter Parker and Janet McDaniel (1992) argue, teachers are "bricoleurs" who are "masters of improvisation" transforming others' strat- egies in order to make them work within their own context. When Michael reflected on his initial resistance to the idea of using imaginative writing, he advised teachers to try it before being too judgmental: My first reaction to creative writing was probably the same as a lot of other people, you say, 'oh, what a load of rubbish' . . . [But] I'm pretty sure that every science teacher should at least tackle it a couple of times and just see how it works . . . it's endless, the variety of things and the techniques you can use . . . It's really changed my thinking- from a traditional science teacher- to realise that there are other ways that you can achieve results and maybe in a more effective way. (Michael) Katie, a true bricoleur, recalls that once she tried imaginative writing she permanently built it into her repertoire. I've always been interested in how kids learn. If you really want to do your job well you're always on the lookout for new things and how you can be most effective as an educator. And I've always been pretty well committed to what works well in education- and this does. (Katie)</page><page sequence="32">1 92 Re/Writing Science from the Margins I conclude that writing informs science and science learning: that is, it illuminates or provides new insights for scientists, teachers, and learners. In science learning, imaginative writing could generate new ways of think- ing in and about science, and new ways of learning for marginalized stu- dents. "Forms of classroom writing may be sanctioned that reflect the language, value-orientations, and relevances that students bring into the classroom with them, instead of [only] ones modeled on discourses of the discipline community" (Freedman and Medway 1994, 15). In this chapter I have opened up clear spaces for dialogue and pro- vided possibilities for disruption of the discourse on the right way to write science, especially in schools. I think that to uncritically perpetuate writ- ing practices that are implicitly underpinned by an ideology that links science with power (and masculinity) is to choose to teach in ways that generate privilege for some students. Those of us in the margins can re/write school science and, perhaps, science. ***** The coalesced idea explored And presented in this collation Is Writing to learn science Can fruitfully engage the imagination.</page><page sequence="33">References Atwater, M.

First names signify that all arguments and theories are constructed by real people and remind us that we all perceive our world through individual frames of reference that represent our multiple subjectivities. 2 Re/present. I have used the "mysterious slash", a tool from poststructuralism, that "both joins and separates like a scar" (Ian Stronach and Maggie MacLure, 1997) to draw attention to boundaries, spaces, connections, contradictions, and multiple meanings. In this case re/present can be read as represent, present again, present in an alternative way, and present from another frame of refer- ence. 3 The collaborating teachers, whose voices are indicated in this chapter by a pseud- onym, were part of a study that I undertook with twenty exemplar teachers. They had each used imaginative writing as a learning and/or assessment tool for at least three years prior to the teacher and student interviews, classroom observa- tions, and student questionnaires of the study that informs this chapter. 4 Gaell is a member of the McClintock Collective, a gender-science-education net- work that has run many professional development activities on inclusive teach- ing. She was a member of the team who ran the workshops that Michael at- tended. 5 The metaphors used by Bacon laid down the foundations of the discourse pat- terns that still construct science as a gendered endeavor.</page></plain_text>
