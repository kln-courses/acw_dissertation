<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective Isaac A. Ogunbiyi UNIVERSITY OF LAGOS 1. The Yoruba and their language The term 'Yoruba' identifies the language, as well as the people - numbering over 24,000,000 (according to a 1983 census figure) who live mainly in Nigeria's south western States of Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, and Kogi and part of Dahomey (now Republic of Benin).1 The various subgroups now known as Yoruba have not always been identified by this common name. In the pre-colonial period, many of the subgroups were under the political control of Oyo, which was then the strongest of them all. Oyo's political power structure, however, gradually disintegrat ed and finally collapsed under the pressure of Muslim jihadists from Ilorin (now cap ital of Kwara State) in the first three decades of the 19th century. During the second half of that century, the different members of the group were engaged in internecine warfare often involving constant alignments and realignments against one another until the advent of British colonialism, along with the Christian missionary venture, which helped to negotiate peace among the feuding subgroups. It was during the second half of that century that the idea of forging a common Yoruba ethnic identity was first mooted among the liberated and Christianised Yoruba in Sierra Leone and was later canvassed and popularised in Lagos by returnees of Yoruba stock from Sierra Leone and Brazil. Among the Yoruba intelligentsia, whose writings promoted this idea by focussing attention on the cultural and historical fea tures common to all the subgroups and thus contributed to the emergence of a sense of unity among the Yoruba, were J.O. George whose Historical Notes on the Yoruba Country was published in 1895 and Samuel Johnson whose History of the Yoruba, though compiled during the closing years of the 19th century, was not published until 1921.2'3 The development of an orthographic system for the transcription of the Yoruba lan guage also owes much to the labour and foresight of liberated Yoruba Christians from Sierra Leone, particularly Samuel Ajayi Crowther (1806-1891), the first African Bishop of the Church Missionary Society. Ajayi Crowther, who hailed from Osogun in the heartland of Yorubaland, was captured and sold into slavery in 1821 but was rescued along with 187 others, freed and resettled in the Bathurst area of Sierra Leone in 1822. He was educated in England and at Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone</page><page sequence="2">22 Journal of Qur'anic Studies between 1831 and 1841 and was consecrated a clergyman of the Church of England in 1843. During the succeeding four decades, Ajayi Crowther was involved in Christian evangelisation in many parts of what was later to become the southern region of colonial Nigeria.4 A considerable number of the liberated slaves who resettled in Sierra Leone were, like Ajayi Crowther, from the areas under the then-weakened and destabilised Oyo Kingdom. 'No less than 3000 of these involuntary emigrants [eventually] returned to the land of their birth' although a large number of them remained behind in Sierra Leone.5 As an enlightened man, Ajayi Crowther realised very early in his career the ines timable value of a written form of the language of his people in the spread of the Christian message. In the words of Reverend Vidal who wrote the introduction to Ajayi Crowther's book A Vocabulary of the Yoruba Language published in 1852, 'a Christian literature became at once a desideratum for the rising Christian communi ty'. A significant start was made in this direction by Ajayi Crowther who spent the last forty years of his life evolving, in collaboration with a number of leading European linguists, an orthographic system for a Yoruba Koine which facilitated his translation of the Bible and some other Christian religious literature into Yoruba. While different views have been expressed by scholars on the features of the Standard or Koine Yoruba used by Ajayi Crowther in his translation,6 there seems to be a broad consensus that it was initially based on the dialects and accents of the Oyo and Egba subgroups, a choice which was informed by the fact of Ajayi Crowther's native dialect background and the exigency of the location of the earliest Christian stations at Abeokuta, the chief city of the Egba. However, this Standard Yoruba which came to function as the literary Yoruba and the language of the educated elite contained not only elements from many of the other dialects but also from the English language. 'Literary Yoruba is seen by some scholars as a mixture of historical dialects and for eign structures (plausibly from English and Hausa/Arabic) using the Oyo-Ibadan and Lagos accents....' It is also said that this 'common Yoruba consists not of a single homogeneous dialect, but rather a number of dialects'.7 This form of Yoruba, created by the Church Missionary Society enterprise not with the intention of doing any grammatical or literary analysis but only for its use in pro moting the word of God,8 has become the only form in use today all over Yorubaland in formal classroom instruction, in the print media and most other forms of Yoruba literary production. It is the basis of the Yoruba used in the Yoruba translations of the Qur'an under discussion in this study. 2. The Arabic Qur'an translated into Yoruba In an article published elsewhere on this topic9 it was established that the three Yoruba</page><page sequence="3">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective 23 translations of the Qur'an which were then available had made a valuable contribu tion to the use of the Yoruba language to accommodate and carry cultural ideas other than the Yoruba culture, religion and world-view. Other aspects of this topic discussed in that article are: (i) the inevitability of needing to translate the Qur'an from the Arabic original into non-Arabic languages spoken by non-Arab converts to Islam in spite of the opinions of some early Muslim jurists to the contrary; (ii) the presence in Yoruba of a considerable number of words, terminologies and expressions traceable to Arabic origin directly or indirectly through the medium of Hausa, another major language of Nigeria; (iii) the morphological and syntactic differences between Yoruba and Arabic which account for a significant increase in the volume of lexical items required to translate a message from Arabic into Yoruba. Since the publication of that study in 1988, another translation of the Qur'an into Yoruba has appeared. The aim of the present study is to examine some of the factors responsible for the apparent delay in the appearance of the earliest complete transla tion of the Qur'an into Yoruba and to analyse some of the strategies employed by the translators in exploiting the morphological properties of the Yoruba language and how far the Yoruba language has responded to the spirit of the Arabic original in the con veyance of the message of this most important Islamic book to the Yoruba receptor. The following are the four Yoruba translations of the Qur'an which form the basis of this study: (i) Itumg Al-Kurani UEde Yoruba by E. K. Akinlade, published by Brotherhood Publication Syndicate, 70, Sipeolu Street, Yaba, Lagos in 1965. (ii) Al-Kurani Ti A Tumg Si Ede Yoruba, prepared by a three-tier committee of Yoruba Muslim scholars and published under the sponsorship and auspices of the World Muslim League by al-Dar al-cArabiyya in 1972. (iii) Al-Kurani Mimg Ni Ede Yoruba Ati Larubawa, published by the Ahmadiyya Mission in Islam, P. 0. Box 418, 45, Idumagbo Avenue, Nigeria in 1976. (iv) Al-Kurani Alapgonle: Itumgo Si Ede Yoruba, by Y. A. Quadri, published in 1996. The above translations are for convenience hereafter referred to in this study by the abbreviations EKA, WML, AHM and YAQ respectively. 3. Probable factors for the late arrival of a complete Yoruba translation of the Qur'an In view of the long contact of the Yoruba with the Islamic faith - a contact which is believed to predate their contact with Christianity by some three centuries10 it is</page><page sequence="4">24 Journal of Qur'anic Studies ironic that a complete translation of the Holy Book of Islam did not appear until the sixth decade of the 20th century. An examination of this issue would suggest the fol lowing factors as likely reasons: 3.1 Islamic Arabic culture Mode of transmission of Islamic teachings: there is abundant evidence to confirm that Islam is a religion which has encouraged literacy right from its inception. Sura 96 of the Qur'an which is believed to contain the first revealed words of this Holy Book commands the Prophet Muhammad to read: iqra' bi'smi rabbika 'lladhi khalaqa ... ('Read in the name of your Lord who created ...'). The reading and recitation of portions of the Qur'an consequently became part of the obligatory features of the practising Muslim's daily worship, thus ensuring his or her regular use of Arabic, the language of the Qur'an and that of virtually all pristine articles of the Islamic faith. This method of 'reading' which, by reason of the physical positions (rakcat) canoni cally prescribed for the five-times-a-day salawat came to assume the form of recall ing, recollecting and remembering from memory (dhikr), may, in part, have inevitably detracted from the importance of direct reading from the text of the Qur'an; especially when Islam eventually spread to non-literate and non-Arab peoples. This was the case in Yorubaland where the earliest propagators of Islam were Hausa/Fulani and Nupe peoples from the north and north-east.11 Not being speakers of the local languages, these preachers of the Islamic faith were initially content to make the new converts learn the rudiments of the faith: primarily and most importantly the kalimat al shahada - la ilaha ilia Allah by which the convert avowed an irrevocable commit ment to Islam and a rejection of belief in or recognition of any other deity besides Allah. Although Qur'anic schools, known in Yorubaland as ile-kewu (home or school for Arabic learning), were later to spring up in different communities, the emphasis in these 'schools' was more on the pupils' recognition of the Arabic alphabet and abil ity to read, which in actual practice was no more or better than ability to recite from memory the shorter suras of the Qur'an which s/he would require for the devotional salawat all through her/his life. Although the Imam who led the salawat at the local mosque or at the Friday congregational prayers was expected to be learned in reading and writing, many of them in actual practice were only slightly better that the mem bers of the congregations they were leading. There were only a few individuals who could be said to be learned clerics and these were either members of the non-Yoruba propagators who first sowed the seed of Islam in Yorubaland or Yoruba Muslims who had received their Islamic education outside Yorubaland. Ilorin, a predominantly Yoruba town to the north/north-west did not become a major centre of Islamic learn ing until the middle of the nineteenth century while other Yoruba towns further south such as Ibadan, Iwo, Abeokuta, Ijebu Ode and Lagos only rose to prominence in Islamic education early in the twentieth century.12 It is noteworthy in the context of</page><page sequence="5">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective 25 this discussion that literacy refers to the ability to read Arabic rather than the native or vernacular language. A corollary of the 'Arabicness' of the whole salawdt and most of the affirmative articles of the Islamic faith is the high premium placed on the Arabic language by Muslims, sometimes bordering on veneration or fear of anything written in the Arabic script among the uneducated, and the disincentive to learn to read or write Yoruba implicit in this attitude to Arabic. 3.2 Muslim oral culture The oral culture of instruction in small or large congregations of Muslim faithfuls has meant that the Yoruba language is used for oral transmission of Islamic knowledge rather than a written form of transmission. The Imam's khutba (sermon) at the con gregational worship, the sessions at which the mufassir - the Qur'an commentator called onitaosiri or onitafusiri in Yoruba - regularly gives lectures embracing exege sis of the Qur'an and even the ile-kewu teacher's descriptions of the features of the Arabic alphabet to his pupils, are all part of this oral culture of transmission. This con trasts sharply with the Yoruba language text-bound tradition with which the propaga tion of the Christian faith started off in Yorubaland. As indicated above in this paper, the evolution of a suitable orthography for the Yoruba language was undertaken by Ajayi Crowther on behalf of the Church Missionary Society right from the 1840s to facilitate the translation of the Holy Bible and the teaching of reading and writing in Yoruba to converts or prospective converts to Christianity. This early emphasis on lit eracy in the vernacular language later developed into the Christian churches involve ment in the business of providing formal education at primary and secondary levels. Since their schools, often named after the Church or various saints, were regarded as an arm of the evangelisation enterprise, enrolment was restricted to members and con verts or prospective converts. The consequence of this was that Muslims were reluc tant to enrol their children in these schools for fear of their being converted, and from the last decade of the nineteenth century Muslim schools for the provision of formal secular education began to be established. This trend was accelerated and expanded by Muslim societies and organisations such as the Ahmadiyya and the Ansar al-Din which established their own schools from the 1920s onward. 3.3 Establishment of secular schools It would appear that because these Muslim organisations established their schools in response to the challenge posed by Christian schools, their primary attention was directed at providing a full secular education with only a smattering of Islamic reli gious education. This orientation was largely dictated by the fact that opportunities for employment in the colonial civil service, in commerce and industry were open only to those literate in the English language.13 Literacy in Arabic and in the vernac ular, in this case Yoruba, was relegated to the background in such secular schools. Thus, although a Muslim organisation such as the Ansar al-Din listed the translation</page><page sequence="6">26 Journal of Qur'anic Studies of the Qur'an into the local language as one of its objectives as far back as 1927,14 this intention never materialised, at least in the form of a translation sponsored by this organisation. This was due to its preoccupation with mainstream secular education. 3.4 Ad hoc interpretations However, the fact that no complete translation of the Qur'an into Yoruba appeared until the mid 1960s did not mean that no translations of Qur'anic verses existed. Numerous pamphlets on Islamic doctrines and practices published by individuals and organisations at various times contained translations of portions of the Qur'an.15 This was in addition to the exegeses of the Qur'an undertaken by Muslim preachers and mufassirun all through the ages since the introduction of Islam to Yorubaland. This means, in effect, that the whole of the Qur'an must have been interpreted into the Yoruba language over and over again by preachers who would thus have built up a corpus of equivalent cliches, idioms and lexemes to convey the Qur'anic message to the Yoruba receptors.16 Many of these words, expressions and structures would have, over time, gained currency in the speech repertoire of the Yoruba Muslims, and in a considerable number of cases, become part of the daily language of the ordinary Yoruba speaker regardless of his religious affiliation,17 especially in view of the nature of the Yoruba society in which members of the same family belonging to dif ferent religions freely live and interact with one another with very little or no fric tion.18 The currency of such lexical and idiomatic equivalents in the Yoruba language would have provided ready materials for codification and documentation by the indi viduals and groups who eventually undertook the complete translations in the 1960s. For these translators, there was no dearth of Yoruba words and idioms for rendering the various levels and nuances of the Islamic narratives, stories, doctrines, legislation and supplications contained in the Qur'an as these must have been freely quoted, interpreted, explained and recycled at one time or the other by Yoruba scholars and Imams. Some of the 'fathers' of the faith from different parts of Yorubaland were well known and highly influential beyond their own home base because of the usually itin erant nature of their activities, hence their speech idiosyncrasies, dialectical peculiar ities, loan translations from their mother-tongue in the case of scholars of non-Yoruba stock, infiltrated into their free interpretations of Qur'anic passages which were often imitated by their students and admirers who in turn passed these on through religious and social networking19 until they acquired some degree of currency and semi-per manence, at least in the Yoruba Muslim speech community.20 This fact is relevant in the discussion of the four translations under study as they exhibit in varying degrees what could be regarded as regional or dialectical peculiarities of their translators. 4. Other linguistic tools available to the translators Mention has earlier been made of the orthographic system adopted by Ajayi Crowther for the translation of the Yoruba Bible towards the middle of the 19th century. It is</page><page sequence="7">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective 27 pertinent to state here that the adoption of the Latin script was not made in a vacuum. In this connection, Samuel Johnson states in his History of the Yorubas: 'After sever al fruitless efforts had been made to invent new characters or adapt the Arabic which was already known to Moslem Yoruba, the Roman characters were naturally adopted, not only because it is the one best acquainted with, but also because it would obviate the difficulties that must necessarily arise if missionaries were first to learn strange characters before they could undertake scholastic and evangelistic work'.21 Also, Adam c Abdullahi al-Iluri says of Ajayi Crowther that 'he started [the use of] the Latin alphabet for writing the Yoruba language for translating the Gospels [Bible] in place of the Arabic alphabet with which the Yoruba were used to writing the Yoruba language.'22 What is clear from these quotations is that the choice of the Latin script was a defeat for the candidacy of the Arabic script for reducing the Yoruba into writing and that the whole exercise of giving the Yoruba language a written form was primarily a Christian enterprise for the furtherance of Christian evangelism. It needs to be said, though, that the use of the Arabic script to write the Yoruba language which predated the adoption of the Latin script and which is said have gained ground in Ilorin by about the middle of the 19th century did not appear to have been popular or encour aged by the Arab scholars for whom the ability to read and write the Yoruba language would not have constituted an achievement of which to be proud, especially as a con siderable number of the scholar class, including the ruling family, were not of Yoruba stock and had no reason to encourage literacy in that language. Its use was therefore most probably confined to the Yoruba folk class who were acquainted with the Arabic sound system through some education in the ile-kewu system but were not strong in the knowledge of the complexities of Arabic lexis and syntax. As a consequence of the calibre of those who used this cajami alphabetic system for writing Yoruba and the diversity between the morphological and phonological systems of Arabic and Yoruba, the use of the Arabic script for writing Yoruba was anything but developed and was ridden with a great deal of imprecision and approximation between the two sound systems such that none but the authors of such materials could read them with absolute ease and correctness. The scanty extant materials of this system consist of folk songs, some of which are reproduced in Jimba's Ilorin Waka and of herbal medicinal recipes and incantations written for, and by, barely literate Muslim practi tioners of the khat al-raml divinatory system.23 Commenting on the text of waka lyrics written in cajami by Shaykh Bidmasi Agbaji, a local Ilorin folk musician who was popular in the second half of the 19th century, Jimba said: 'many people are unable to read the verses [lyrics] on account of its difficulty which is due, in the first place, to the insufficient attention paid by people in our times to the use of the Arabic alphabet in writing Yoruba and in the second place to several dictation and structural</page><page sequence="8">28 Journal of Qur'anic Studies errors which abound in the copies of the songs in circulation among people, probably as a result of copyists' errors.'24 Obviously, the lack of uniformity and consistency in the cajami orthography partly contributed to the failure of these materials to survive the age in which they were written without suffering substantial damage and loss of intelligibility. The translators of the Qur'an into Yoruba in the mid 1960s thus had an established orthography which they could utilise, albeit one which was originally devised and adopted by the Christian religion for its own advantage. In addition to the existence of a corpus of Muslim religious dialect consisting of lex ical and idiomatic items in current use among the Yoruba, there was also what could be described as a Christian religious dialect consisting of loan-translations and inno vative structures which have gained currency in the oral and written Yoruba as a result of the Yoruba Bible. In this connection, Fagborun writes, 'His [Crowther's] choice of a dialect (not co-existensive with any local dialect) and his selection of idioms and expressions in this dialect sanctioned for the Yoruba reader through his Bible transla tion and for the linguist through his grammar and dictionary, created [a] Standard Yoruba which has now affected the language and become so widespread that other forms are rapidly disappearing.'25 The translators of the Qur'an into Yoruba had, of necessity, to combine these pervasive linguistic tools with their own Muslim dialect in spite of strenuous efforts to avoid the use of expressions with palpable associations with Christian or traditional religions. More will be said on this point later. 5. Peculiarities of existing Yoruba translations of the Qur'an In the published article on this topic referred to earlier in this paper, the major lin guistic and religious orientations of the first three of the existing Yoruba translations of the Qur'an were highlighted. WML, for example, is said to be marked by 'its excessive circumlocution, its employment of many lexical items which are of doubt ful Yoruba origin' and has a 'target audience [which] appears to be Muslim Yoruba and not any Yoruba as can be seen from the very incidence of what may be called the "metalanguage" of Islam which has not gained admission into the form of Yoruba lan guage in common usage'26 With regard to EKA, 'the greatest flaw ... is its being an M3 where the Arabic text are Ml and the English translations employed by this trans lation are M2' and it consequently ends up duplicating 'all the flaws in the English medium and ... [fails] to capture the spirit of the original [Arabic] text'. EKA also 'employs the common Yoruba usage except where [the translator] betrays his [Christian] biblical background ... AHM seems to have benefited from EKA and WML, both of which predated it chronologically'.27 The aim in this section is to examine what further contribution YAQ has made to Islamic religious literature in Yoruba by itself and in contrast and comparison with the</page><page sequence="9">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective 29 three earlier translations. It is worth stating at this point that the texts which are exam ined in the present study have further confirmed all the observations made in the 1988 study on the features peculiar to the three earliest translations. As was done in the study of the other translations, a few remarks on the background of Yasir Quadri, the translator, may serve to shed some light on the orientation of his translation. Quadri holds a doctorate degree in Islamic Studies, a subject which he teaches at a Nigerian University where he currently holds a chair in Islamic Studies. Although his mother-tongue is the Ijebu dialect of Yoruba, during the two decades preceding the publication of his translation, he lived and taught at Ilorin where the spoken Yoruba dialect in ordinary speech is replete with Arabic and Hausa words and phrases expressing Islamic sentiments. It is pertinent to add that the three-tier com mittee which produced WML had a preponderance of Muslim scholars from the Ilorin Yoruba dialect area. In the foreword to YAQ, Quadri states that his intention is to produce an improved translation to existing ones such as AHM and WML both of which he mentions by description. In connection with WML, he says: mo sakiyesi pe awgn gbolohun kan wa ninuu re ti itumoo won yato si agboye opolgpo awgn gmg 'Kaarg 00 jure' tabi ti wgn kd tile gbg agboye awgn gbolohun miran. (T observed that it contains some expressions whose meanings differ from the com mon understanding of the Yoruba [literally: 'sons of Kaarg odjiire, the common form of expression with which the Yoruba greet one another in the early morning] or some which they [Yoruba] do not understand at all.')28 A cursory reading of YAQ by itself reveals the following: (i) Its language reflects the latest reform in Yoruba orthography and spelling intro duced by Yoruba language experts in the 1960s. Before then, Yoruba orthogra phy remained largely that which was agreed upon at the CMS Conference on Yoruba Language in January 187529 and codified through the Yoruba translation of the Bible which was completed in 1884 and bound into one volume in 1900.30 In the intervening years, there was a great deal of fluidity in the ortho graphic system and this allowed for individual variations especially with the increased output of Yoruba creative writing from the 1930s onward.31 The clam our for a measure of control and standardisation culminated in the Report of the Yoruba Orthography Reformation, published by the Nigeria Western State Ministry of Education in 1969, containing what was adopted from the submis sions made by various Yoruba language scholars especially Ayo Bamgbose of the University of Ibadan.32 YAQ is the only one among the four translations</page><page sequence="10">30 Journal of Qur'anic Studies which fully implements this standardised Yoruba orthography complete with all the essential tone marks which, in the Yoruba language, are as significant as consonants and vowels.33 (ii) YAQ extensively exploits the internal dynamics of the simple Yoruba verbal sys tem by which an infinite series of related lexical items can be generated by an almost regular system of prefixes, such as olumujdde - 'one who causes to come out' - used in Q.2:72, which is from the Yoruba verb jade - 'to come out'. Some of such formations which may never have been used before can still be decod ed by ordinary users of the language even though they may sound quaint and have a tinge of extreme 'book-language' literalism about them. For example, olugbafa - 'one who lets or submits themself to be drawn' (from the Yoruba verb fa- 'to pull, draw, attract') - is used to translate muslim(un) in Q.2:128.34 The Yoruba verb gbagbo (Arabic dmana - 'to believe') recurs on virtually every page of the Yoruba translation of the Qur'an in its various forms and is thus a good example to illustrate the derivatives obtainable from it through the dynam ics of the Yoruba language:35 Verb Prefix Derivative Meaning gbagbo i- igbagbo the act of having belief (noun) n- nigbagbo to have belief, faith (verb) olu-/oni olugbagbo/ one who has faith, a believer omgbagbo (noun) alai- alaigbagbo one who does not have faith (noun) Like WML and to some extent AHM, YAQ employs this device to avoid, as much as is practicable, current Yoruba words and expressions with the faintest association with or overtone of Christian or Yoruba traditional religious usage. We see, for example, the use of omroo-idunnu to translate bashir in Q.2:119 rather than akede ihinrere (EKA Q.2:114). YAQ also uses this technique to inno vate words to replace a number of words used by WML which are of doubtful Yoruba origin. As is to be expected, such an expansively useful device is liable occasionally to go out of bounds as, for example, in YAQ's translation of Q.2.255: La ilaha ilia huwa ('There is no god except Him') - Allah; kd si Olujosi fun miran aya.fi Oun. The Yoruba verb si from which Olujosi is derived is only used in the negative as in the first part of this verse: ko si ('there is no/ there does not exist'). The verb which is used to express positive existence or being is wa, as in 6 wa ('there exists/is'). So the word Olujosi is a malformation which fails to convey the intended message. If a word along the same pattern</page><page sequence="11">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective 31 must be employed here, it must be Olujgwa ('coexisting') or Oluddwd ('the Unique', as used in WML for the same verse). (iii) YAQ makes exhaustive use of explanatory notes inserted between parentheses in the translation. These inserts are used to: (a) introduce essential connectives such as in the series of conjoined statements from Q.2:47 to Q.2:85; (b) make obligatory specifications of pronoun subjects or objects contained in Arabic verbs where confusion or ambiguity is likely to result in the Yoruba translation if they are not specified; for example in Q.2:124 where such specifications clarify which pronouns refer to Abraham and which ones refer to his Lord; (c) offer brief explanations of proper names, idioms, cultural and religious con cepts which are unfamiliar to the Yoruba receptors such as those contained in the culturally-loaded Q.2:178 on the acceptable criteria for the payment of blood-money to a victim's relations. It must be pointed out though that WML too offers footnote comments on a few Arab culture-specific items as in Q.2:158 but these footnotes end abruptly at Q.4:16 in the reprint of that translation available to us for this study. A closer examination of YAQ in comparison with earlier translations, especially WML, reveals a remarkable degree of similarity in sentence structure and phrase ology. This is evident from an analysis of the Yoruba expressions used by the four translations to convey the meanings of two religiously-loaded Arabic words, namely, hanif- the concept and practice of true monotheism, especially that associated with the patriarch Abraham before the advent of Islam, and mushrik - the practice of poly theism. These two words co-occur in connection with Abraham's faith in the follow ing Qur'anic verses: Q.2:135; 3:67, 95; 4:125; 6:79, 161; 10:105; 16:120, 123; 22:31; 98:5, while hanlf occurs alone in Q.4:125; 30:130 and mushrikun/at occur alone in Q.2:221.36 The following are the observations in connection with the translation of hanif. (i) Out of ten phrases, WML and YAQ agree with each other nine times, AHM agrees with the two of them three times, while EKA agrees with the three others only once. (ii) AHM uses seven phrases which are peculiar to it alone. (iii) EKA uses eight phrases which are peculiar to it alone. In the translation of mushrikun/at, the following are observable: (i) Out of eleven phrases, WML and YAQ agree with each other in all eleven</page><page sequence="12">32 Journal of Qur'anic Studies instances while AHM agrees with WML and YAQ seven times and EKA four times. (ii) AHM uses four phrases which are peculiar to it alone. (iii) EKA uses four phrases which are peculiar to it alone. It is observed that EKA's translation of the above item totals eight times only out of the eleven occurrences in the Arabic because this translation sometimes misses out completely or paraphrases some materials from the original Arabic passages, partly because of its complete reliance on English-language translations of the Qur'an. For examples of such omissions, see EKA's translations of Q.2:139, 187, 220.37 This analysis shows clearly that there is a great deal of agreement between WML and YAQ while EKA stands at the other end of the spectrum and AHM falls between the two camps. This view of the relative positions of the four translations is further con firmed by the linear and structural comparison of the four translations in Appendix III. This Appendix also highlights a feature which distinguishes YAQ from the other three, and this is the full tone marks numbering about 150 in this verse alone com pared with eight in WML and one in each of AHM and EKA. Also noticeable is the evidence of YAQ's consistent application of the reformed Yoruba orthography as it relates to tonal changes and vowel modifications in genitival relationships as in: djisee Allah, araa won, lgdgg Allah, etc., which are entirely absent from the other translations.38 While the religion-specific terms such as hanif and mushrikun/at discussed above are translated into their approximate Yoruba equivalents, there are several other terms in the Qur'an which are culturally specific and are best retained in their transliterated Arabic forms because the cultural diversity between the Arabs and the Yoruba is such that no Yoruba equivalents can be found for them.39 Appendix IV shows how YAQ dif fers from the others in clarifying the connotation of such terms by the insertion of explanatory notes in the text of his translation. 6. Arabic-induced structures in Yoruba translations The present writer recalls that in the 1940s and 50s pupils in public secondary schools and in upper primary schools in Yorubaland were forbidden by school rules to con verse in Yoruba within the school premises as part of the effort to encourage fluency in English, which was the language of the educated class, of upward social mobility and of government business. The stern warning by teachers and class monitors was always, 'Don't speak vernacular!' However, most pupils, especially in the rural areas, hardly used English outside school, hence their limited exposure to, and practice of, English to express their inner feelings. Consequently the students, torn between the inexorable influence of Yoruba - their mother-tongue - and the fear of being</page><page sequence="13">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective 33 punished, often produced monstrous 'English' expressions which were word-for word literal translations from Yoruba. Such 4 Yoruba English' was usually the butt of humorous jokes among teachers and pupils in those days. They include: 'May I be allowed to...' - this introductory part is memorised by every pupil, so there could be no mistake in it; '...go home because my head is breaking me' (in Yoruba 'am having headache' is: on ti fo mi where the verb ti fg is literally 'breaking'; 'He is opening the fight between the two' - in Yoruba, to separate two people who are fighting/exchanging blows is: 6 ti laja laarin awgn mejeeji, where the verb ti laja is made up of ti (tense marker), la ('to open'), and ija ('fight'). In like manner, Yoruba who are educated in English and Arabic are known to produce expressions in each of Arabic and Yoruba which exhibit traces of syntactical and semantic interference from one or both of the other two languages, even under exam ination conditions.40 The Yoruba translations of the Qur'an under study reveal a num ber of Yoruba structures which are believed to have been induced by their Arabic source. Q.2:165 starts with the expression: wa-min al-nds man yattakhidhu min dun 'lldhi andadan.. ('there are among men those who have adopted [for worship] other things besides Allah as [His] equals'). This verse is translated as follows in YAQ: wa- min al-nds man yattakhi min duni Alldhi anddda dhu n Owa ninu awon ti won rijosin awon miran ti 6 yato si Allah eniyan fun nkan In an attempt to closely imitate the word sequence of the Arabic source text, except in the direct object of the verb, the translator ends up producing a structure which would sound odd and 'bookish' to Yoruba monolinguals because such a structure is never used by them in normal speech and may be misunderstood by anyone not famil iar with the Arabic original. The third person pronoun, O in normal usage does not function as an indefinite or neutral agent which this translation is intended to convey, and therefore this YAQ passage is likely to be understood as meaning: 'He is among the/those men who ...' The series of conjoined phrases in Q.2:200b-201 with a simi lar structure to the above (namely: fa-min al-nds man yaqulu, and: wa-minhum man yaqul) are translated into Yoruba in YAQ and WML following the same pattern as Q.2:165. Another example of induced syntactical structure which is loan-translated from Arabic is in AHM Q.2:215 (it is Q.2:214 in WML and YAQ) as follows:</page><page sequence="14">34 Journal of Qur'anic Studies wa-lamma ya?tikum mathal 'lladhlna khalaw min qablikum nigbati ko iti wa ohun ti o s'ori awon ti mbe saju yin s'ori yin wa While the linear order in Arabic sentence structure permits the complex verbal fronting exhibited in the Arabic source text, the basic attested linear order in Yoruba is SVO (subject-verb-object), although each of these constituent parts may range from a single-consonant word to an entire phrase or clause. Verbal fronting as in AHM's translation of this verse is abnormal in Yoruba. It is significant that the oddi ty in this dislocation of the linear order in Yoruba is absent from YAQ's translation of the same verse, thus: nigbati iru nkan ti 6 de ba awon ti 6 siwajuu yin ko i tii ba yin. Further examples of Arabic-induced phraseology WML/YAQ Q.2:172 present in Yoruba translation two phrases which can only be explained by reference to their Arabic original as follows: Arabic kulu min tayyibdtind razaqndkum wa-shkuru lilldhi WML e ma ninu awon ohun ti A pa lese fun ki e si ma Dupe fun je o dara ti yin Olohun YAQ e maa ninu awon ohun A pa lese fun ki e si maa dupe fun je mimo ti yin Allah The expression pa lese in these translations is supposed to be a translation of 'provide for' in the Arabic original. However, the normal Yoruba form of the verb in these translations is pese, and it belongs to a class of Yoruba verb-nominal combinations such as pade and jokdo, which are fixed in the sense that one of the items in the com bination no longer occurs as an independent item in the language.41 Their verbal nouns, formed with the prefix [/-] are: ipese ('provision'), ipade ('meeting, gather ing'), ijokdo ('sitting, session'). Pa lese fun yin in WML and YAQ is an attempt to replicate in Yoruba the semantic sequence embedded in the Arabic verb's suffixed subject and object: razaq -nd -kum Provide we [for] you The same Yoruba phrase is employed by WML and YAQ to translate the Arabic passive voice verb uHddat [lil-kdfirin] - ('prepared for the unbelievers') in Q.2:24: Arabic u?iddat lil-kdfirin WML a pa a lese fun awon alaigbagbo YAQ [Allah] pa a lase sile de awon alaigbagbo</page><page sequence="15">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective 35 The last phrase in WML's and YAQ's translations of Q.2:172 is also innovative as far as Standard Yoruba is concerned. Dupe fun Olghun/Allah presents an odd use of the Yoruba wtxbfun ('give') as a preposition between dupe and its object, and this is pre sumably under the influence of the Arabic preposition //, ('to, for'). The normal preposition between dupe and its object in Yoruba is lgwo, which is idiomatically used without any literal anthropomorphic connotation. It would appear though that the Arabic-induced phrase dupe fun has gained considerable currency among Yoruba Muslims such that its use in these translations may be no more than a recognition and codification of the spoken language as 'no translator ... can completely overlook the way in which certain expressions ... have already come into use in the receptor lan guage'.42 It may also be explained by the permissible use of fun in fi ope fun Olorun/Allah ('give thanks/gratitude to God') where fun is a second object-marker to the ditransitive verb fi ('give')43 Conclusion YAQ has joined the three earlier Yoruba translations of the Qur'an in contributing to the 'use of the Yoruba language to accommodate and carry cultural and religious ideas other than the traditional Yoruba culture, religion and world-view'.44 Just as AHM seems to have benefitted from EKA and WML which predated it as evidenced in the considerable 'similarity of phraseology between [it] and one or both of EKA and WML',45 it is clear that YAQ in turn has benefitted immensely from earlier transla tions, more especially WML with which it shares a considerable degree of structural and semantic similarity as can be seen in the sampled text in Appendix III. While YAQ marks a great deal of improvement over the others in Yoruba style and orthography, it still could not completely rid itself of some lexical items in WML which are not easi ly intelligible to most Yoruba receptors. An example is in the translation of Q.2:18: Arabic summun bukmun cumyun WML aditi ni won ayaya ni won afoju ni won YAQ aditi ni won ayaya ni won afoju ni won Compared to the translation of the same expression in Q.2:171: Arabic summun bukmun cumyun WML aditi odi afoju YAQ aditi odi afoju It is obvious that odi ('dumb') in the second passage could have been employed by YAQ in both passages in place of ayaya, which is not in use in other dialects of Yoruba except perhaps in Ilorin. Also, as a product of the linguistic and cultural envi ronment for which he is translating, even the translator of YAQ could not help laps ing into the snare of using an unfamiliar dialectal item in Q.48:29 (see Appendix III).</page><page sequence="16">36 Journal of Qur'anic Studies The word terupa used by the translator for 'mark' (probably from the translator's Ijebu dialect) is not attested in Standard Yoruba which has eepafor 'scab'. As indicated earlier in this study, the Yoruba translations of the Qur'an serve along side their primary religious objective as a register of the imageries, idioms and expressions which have been used by Muslim scholars and imams over the last two centuries or more to convey the content of the Qur'an and other Islamic literature to the Yoruba audience. In the process a wide spectrum of common Yoruba usage includ ing loan-translations in the Yoruba Bible which have become part of the common Yoruba repertoire have found their way into these translations of the Qur'an despite conscious efforts made by some of the translators to avoid expressions with palpable non-Islamic associations like those freely used in EKA. YAQ Q.2:27, 125 and AHM Q.2:35-36 use majgemu ('pact, covenant') as in Genesis 9:9 and Jeremiah 31:31; WML Q.2:187 uses atipo ('sojourn'); WML Q.2:213 uses onihinrere as in Isaiah 52:7 and Matthew 24:14. Perhaps if it is realised that Ajayi Crowther 'had to seek out tra ditional priests and Muslims among the Yoruba in Freetown, study their practices and liturgies and through this build up a vocabulary suitable for [translating] the scriptures and the Prayer Book',46 translators of religious and secular materials would entertain less resentment against the use of suitable correspondences from the common lin guistic heritage to which all have contributed at various times in the past. Anyone who examines the content of Ajayi Crowther's Vocabulary of the Yoruba Language of 1952 will appreciate how much he took from his Muslim informants in Freetown because he acknowledged many of them in his entries and used a considerable num ber of these materials in his translations of Christian literature. Although many of the expressions and structures borrowed from English and other languages to translate the Bible in the last century sounded quaint, ambiguous and even nonsensical to Yoruba monolinguals at the turn of the 20th century, they have become common usage today. In like manner, many of the expressions in the existing Yoruba translations of the Qur'an which may sound unfamiliar to some receptors today, may, in the course of time become acceptable common usage as a result of dif fusion through the network of teachers, imams and readers, and thus further expand and enrich the speech repertoire of the Yoruba. It is instructive that most of these usages appear 'quaint' for reasons of syntax and semantics rather than vocabulary. YAQ, which is the latest of the four translations, and, to some extent, EKA and AHM contain far fewer loan-words which are still easily traceable to Arabic than would have been suggested by the long contact of the Yoruba with Islam and its language. This is testimony to the dynamics of the Yoruba language to generate new words to cope with new ideas: a device which was galvanised by the Arabic language itself from the eighth century AD to cater for foreign concepts when philosophical and sci entific materials began to be translated into it from, among others, Indian, Persian and</page><page sequence="17">Arabic-Yoruba Translation of the Qur'an: A Socio-linguistic Perspective 37 Greek sources. Three of the Yoruba translations of the Qur'an are as yet less than thir ty years old on average while the fourth is less than three years old. Opportunities are therefore ripe for their review and revision to improve their quality, especially with feedback from their users, and particularly as the earliest three were already out of print by late 1998 when it was found impossible to locate new copies to purchase for the purpose of this study.</page><page sequence="18">38 Journal of Qur'anic Studies APPENDIX I Table showing classification and frequency of Yoruba expressions used to translate hanif: Phrase used WML YAQ AHM EKA ti o duro/ oluduro/ 8 8 1 ? wiwa ni dede tele [esin] ododo/ 2 12 2 olododo te nte si/ olute si ? ? 5 ?
