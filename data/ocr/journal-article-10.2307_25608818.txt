<plain_text><page sequence="1">The iconicity of Islamic calligraphy in Turkey IRVIN CEMIL SCHICK Islamic calligraphy is deeply polysemic. At the most basic level, of course, it embodies written text, and as such expresses symbolically the meaning?whether literal or metaphorical, denoted or connoted?of that text. But that is not all. As a highly visual art, Islamic calligraphy sometimes means iconically; and as a practice that is, at least in the Turkish context, intensely imbricated with politics, it also means indexically. This article attempts to chart the movement of Islamic calligraphy among these three types of signs1 before, during, and after Turkey's passage from empire to republic, with special emphasis on its iconicity. It is often said that calligraphy is the most quintessential^ Islamic of all Islamic arts, and this not because of some supposed Islamic iconophobia, but rather because of the intimate relationship between the Muslim faith and the written text.2 While iconic representation is usually contrasted with writing, and the two are thought to be direct opposites, written text can sometimes have an iconic?that is, pictorial?quality, and this is especially true of some Islamic calligraphy (fig. 1).3 A practice widespread among Sufis and Shi'ites, though by no means limited to them, is to shape calligraphy into figurative images ranging from mosques and everyday objects like ewers and oil lamps, to animals like lions, camels, and birds, and even human beings.4 Received opinion holds that these images are mere substitutes for "real" pictures?surrogates in which writing provides the artists with an alibi, an accommodation of sorts to the so-called "Islamic prohibition of images." But form often deliberately adds a new layer of meaning to the calligraphy, and this is indeed the principal focus of this article. Valerie Gonzalez has distinguished between works of pictorial calligraphy in which the image dominates the text, which she calls the "figural or representational regime," and those in which the text dominates the image, which she calls the "scriptural regime." She also distinguishes between those works of pictorial calligraphy in which the text and image share a single referent, and those in which their referents are distinct.5 The examples I discuss here are drawn from each of these categories and will demonstrate, I hope, the specific "value-added" iconicity in Islamic calligraphy. Writing as icon Let me begin with a brief discussion of a work that would at first sight appear to be plain text, and yet is perceived and treated as an image. Figure 2 is a textual representation of the so-called "Seal of Prophethood," a mark between the shoulders of the Prophet Muhammad that is taken as proof of his divine mission.6 What is An earlier version of this paper was read at the "Deus (e)X Historia" conference held at MIT on April 26-28, 2007. I am very grateful to the convenors, Arindam Dutta, Mark Jarzombek, Caroline Jones, Erika Naginski, and Nasser Rabbat, for their kind invitation. I would also like to acknowledge the other conference participants, as well as the audience, for the lively discussion that followed?and particularly Daniel Bertrand Monk, for his perceptive observation that the changing fortunes of Islamic calligraphy in Turkey have endowed it with an indexical quality. 1. As will no doubt be clear to many readers, I am referring here to the "second trichotomy of signs" proposed by Charles Sanders Peirce?namely symbol, index, and icon.

And to those who look at it at the beginning of the month, until the end of the month. And to those who look at it at the beginning of the year, until the end of the year. And for those who look at it while on a journey, may their journey be blessed. And those who die in the year during which they have looked at it shall die with faith. At the end of the text, after the signature, are the customary prayers, including asking for God's forgiveness for the calligrapher, for his parents, and "for all those who look at it." It is significant that the verb "to read" does not occur once, anywhere on the panel. Instead, the word nazar (to look) recurs time and again. This emphasis on looking strongly suggests that the panel was not only regarded as written text, as well as a devotional object, but also as an image. After all, one reads text, but one looks at an image. Indeed, this hypothesis would seem to be borne out by the occasional practice of supplementing calligraphy with captions. Beginning in the eighteenth century, it became common in Ottoman devotional manuscripts to include a section in which a series of holy names (starting with Allah and Muhammad, and often ending with the Seven Sleepers and their dog) would be placed within large medallions, one name per medallion per page.7 The fact that these medallions are literally hors texte already endows them with a certain pictorial quality, but there is more to it than that. In many cases, the medallions appear below (or are sandwiched between) a caption that does nothing but state the obvious. For example, if the name "Muhammad" appears in the central medallion, then the accompanying caption might say something like: "This is the name of His Excellency Muhammad, may prayers to God and peace be upon Him." If the name in the medallion is "Abu Bakr," then the caption might say: "This is the name of His Excellency Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him." This is a common pattern and begs the question of why the captions were added in the first place. After all, if one can read the caption, then surely one can also read the central medallion. The answer to the puzzle is that the caption refers in fact to two distinct objects. When it says: "This," it is referring to the medallion below it; and when it says "is the name of Muhammad," it is referring to the proper name of the Prophet. In other words, the medallion is not identical to the name, it is an image of the name. It is, in fact, an icon. Indeed, in many such books, virtually identical captions accompany pictures in the ordinary sense of the word?for example, images of holy relics such as the mantle of the Prophet or his footprint. As the word for "picture," resm, is very similar to the word for "name," ism, the captions both look and sound almost exactly alike. The captioned medallions in devotional books are related to the genre known as hilye-i ?er?fe or hilye-i saadet, invented by the Ottoman calligrapher Hafiz Osman in the late seventeenth century.8 These are word portraits of the Prophet Muhammad, describing, within an eminently recognizable composition, his physical and 7.

With slight variations, the central medallion contains the following text: [It is related] from 'Ali (may God be pleased with him) that when he described the attributes of the Prophet (may prayers to God and peace be upon him), he said: He was not too tall, nor was he too short, he was of medium height amongst the nation. His hair was not short and curly, nor was it lank, it would hang down in waves. His face was not overly plump, nor was it fleshy, yet it was somewhat circular. His complexion was rosy white. His eyes were large and black, and his eyelashes were long. He was large-boned and broad-shouldered. His torso was hairless except for a thin line that stretched down his chest to his belly. His hands and feet were rather large. When he walked, he would lean forward as if going down a slope. When he looked at someone, he would turn his entire body towards him. Between his two shoulders was the Seal of Prophethood, and he was the last of the prophets. That these panels were intended as portraits is clear not only from the descriptive text above, but also from the fact that the components of the panel were named (from top to bottom): ba?makam (head station), gobek (belly), kusak (belt), and etek (skirt). Now, the Arabic word hilyah refers to the features or appearance of a person, and the Ottoman compounds hilye-i serife (noble hi lye) and hilye-i saadet (felicitous hilye) denote the features or appearance of the Prophet Muhammad. Tim Stanley has suggested that while the hilye may have arisen as the Muslim counterpart of the Orthodox Christian icon, in view of the fact that a figural representation of the Prophet would have been frowned upon in the Sunni tradition, it was most likely inspired by the celebrated poem of the sixteenth-century Ottoman poet HakanT Mehmed Bey known as Hilye-i Hakan? (the hilye of HakanT).9 This latter was in turn based on 9.

And whoever is true to me, God will spare him the fire of Hell, and he will not experience the trials of the grave, and he will not be driven naked on the Day of Judgment.10 If Hafiz Osman did indeed draw his inspiration from the Hilye-i Hakani, then he created his hilye panels primarily as objects of contemplation: "whoever sees my hilye/' were the words reportedly spoken by the Prophet, not "whoever reads my hilye." Once again, then, the hilye is meant not so much to be read, as to be seen. As such, it is an image, albeit one made up of plain text. (It has been noted, incidentally, that the composition of the hilye bears some resemblance to the ground plan of an Ottoman mosque;11 whether or not this was intentional, and, if so, what that might mean, remains to be determined.) Peircean iconicity Figure 1 is unmistakably a picture, and figures 2 and 3 are essentially plain inscriptions that present themselves as images. In none of these examples, however, does the form of the writing echo its meaning. Thus, for example, the stork by Mustafa Rakim illustrated in figure 1 spells out the formula: "In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful" with which Muslim believers begin every task, and which obviously has nothing whatsoever to do with storks. On the other hand, there is another well-known calligraphic stork, this one designed by an Ottoman calligrapher named Abdulgani in 1763, where the text forming the bird is a couplet about a certain dervish known in his day as "Seyyid Hasan Leylek Dede."12 Here, "Hasan" was the dervish's given name, "Seyyid" is a title denoting the fact that he was a direct descendent of the Prophet, and "Dede" indicates his rank within the dervish order to which he belonged. As for "Leylek," it is Turkish for "stork" and was a nickname that he reportedly earned because he was very tall and lanky. The poem that composes the image celebrates the devotion of this dervish to his master, the thirteenth century patron of the order of whirling dervishes Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi. What is most important here is that the text and the image are related at a very basic level. The text speaks of a dervish known by the nickname "the Stork," and it is also shaped like a stork. In the words of Gonzalez, in this example, text and image share a single referent.

There are many such examples. Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and the fourth caliph according to Sunni Muslims (and his first legitimate successor according to Shi'ites) was nicknamed Haydar and Asadullah?the former meaning "lion" and the latter "lion of God." For this reason, many calligraphic compositions containing invocations and prayers to him are shaped like a lion.13 In other cases, the letter ya in Ali's name is forked, to resemble his fabled sword, dhulfiqar. Many panels declaring "Ah min al-'ashq" (Ah! [How I have suffered] from love) have the letter ha shaped like a tearful eye, sometimes pierced by an arrow.15 A particularly sophisticated instance appears in figure 4, which shows a calligraphic image by Mustafa Halim Ozyazici.16The text in the form of a hand is a well-known verse from the Qur'an, which reads: "And we have not sent you but as mercy to the worlds" (a/ Anbiya 21:107). It is spoken by God to the Prophet Muhammad and is taken to mean that the latter's mission is evidence of God's grace. Under the hand are two lines of poetry in Turkish, which say: No matter how great a sinner I may be, I do not grieve So long as proof of mercy is in hand: "And we have not sent , you ..." The Qur'anic verse stating that the Prophet has been sent to humanity by God as an act of mercy is written in the form of a hand, then, just as the affirmation it represents is "in hand" by virtue of the sacred revelation. In all these cases, the text and the image share a single referent, and the meaning of the text corresponds exactly to the meaning of the image into which the text has been woven. When the written text is not simply pictorial but furthermore bears a visual equivalence to its meaning, it can be said to have an iconic character in the semiotic sense of the word, as formulated by Charles Sanders Peirce. For Peirce, an icon signifies its object by sharing certain attributes with it?that is, through resemblance and similarity, as would be the case with a painted portrait as the sign of a particular individual. Another, often-cited example of iconicity is onomatopoeia, since using words that sound like their objects amounts to acoustic iconicity. Indeed, until not so long ago, onomatopoeia was the only acknowledged form of linguistic iconicity?though by now, iconicity has been shown to operate at many levels in language and in the literary text?notably, in typography and calligraphy17 13.

Interestingly, works of Islamic calligraphy that are iconic in this particular sense are not limited to figurative pictures such as those of birds and animals. There are, once again, examples of plain text in which iconicity is present, albeit in an extremely subtle way. Figure 5a shows a magnificent piece of calligraphy by Elhac Mehmed Nazif Bey,18 composed of a short poem in Turkish extolling the virtues of the formula "In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful," known in abbreviated form as the Basmala or Bismillah. This formula is very important, in that by reciting it, the believer invokes the name of God upon undertaking any task. Indeed, there is a saying attributed to the Prophet, to the effect that any action not initiated by reciting this formula is doomed to fail.19 The poem is of no great literary value, and reads as follows: Figure 5b. Detail from the panel in Figure 5a. As soon as Sultan Bismillah raises his flag The angels become the pillars of the court of Bismillah Interpret its equator as the Sirat-i Mustakfm The short route of Bismillah leads towards God Before discussing the calligraphy, let me note that the phrase al-$irat al-Mustaqrm, or "the straight path," appears in the very first chapter of the Qur'an, and is taken to mean the true faith, that is, Islam.

Those who can cross the bridge, on the other hand, reach the side of God. In the poem, a visual analogy is drawn between the bridge of $irat and the words Bismillah, as I will now attempt to explain. Figure 5b shows a close-up of the words Bismillah in the first line of the poem. Here, bismi, or "in the name," is shaded horizontally, and Allah, the proper name of God, vertically. Together, these two words read bismillahi and mean "In the name of God," the beginning of the Basmala formula. The poem plays on the lengthened arc in the words bismi. In an ordinary text, these words would be written with a short arc; however, calligraphers traditionally lengthened the arc when writing this particular formula. Such lengthened Basmalas are very common and are termed oklu Besmele (Basmala with arrow) in Turkish. With its lengthened arc, which the poet qualifies as an "equator," the formula is likened to the bridge of $irat, which, going from right to left, leads straight to Allah. So we have here a bit of visual iconicity. The formula Bismillah leads the believer to God, and it actually looks like the very bridge over which the believer is to reach God in the afterlife. Moreover, in the last line where the poem refers to the Basmala as a "short route" that leads to God, the calligrapher has shortened the arc, so that once again the form of the writing echoes the meaning of the text itself. Another example of visual iconicity in Islamic calligraphy appears in Figure 6a, a panel by the great Ottoman calligrapher Mehmed ?efik Bey.20 Why it is in the form of a pear, I do not know.21 What I want to stress is a bit more subtle. The text says: "Mercy Ali, Fatima, Hasan, Husayn," that is, it addresses itself to Islam's equivalent of the "Holy Family": the Prophet's daughter Fatima, his son-in-law AM, and his two grandsons Hasan and Husayn. (In fact, the name of the Prophet himself is also hidden in the composition, as the word aman, mercy, is numerologically equivalent to the name Muhammad.) In Figure 6b, the first letter of the name AN, the Arabic 'ayn, is shaded vertically, and the first letter of the name Fatima, fa, horizontally. What is interesting is that the name of the first letter of Ali is a homonym of the Arabic word for "eye." Furthermore, there is, in both Arabic and Turkish, the expression "to be in someone's eye," which means to be loved, to be esteemed, to be valued. So by placing Fatima into the 'ayn/eye of Ali, this inscription is in fact giving the message that the Prophet's daughter was greatly beloved and esteemed by her spouse, the Caliph Ali. Visually, the calligraphic composition makes Fatima "the apple of Ali's eye"?an expression that has the same meaning in Turkish (Ali'nin goz bebegi) as it does in English. A clever visual pun, then, that was imitated by several later calligraphers, and another nice instance of visual iconicity. Many more examples could be given in support of the claim that compositions made up of Arabic letters can be iconic in both the general and the Peircean sense. These examples are perhaps not "typical" of Islamic calligraphy, but they do represent a subset of some significance and show the degree of semiotic sophistication that the art sometimes reached, particularly in Ottoman Turkey. The Republican rupture As Umberto Eco has noted, icons are culturally coded.22 For readers of the present article who are not Islamicists, I suspect this fact has been driven home all the more clearly by the myriad references to which I have alluded in order to expose the iconicity of the calligraphies; without those references, these would just have been plain inscriptions?or, worse, indecipherable scribbles. It is this culturally coded nature of icons that I wish to underscore, as I now move from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Turkey, that is, to the nation state that emerged from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire and set its eyes firmly on the path of westernization. This path deliberately severed Turkey's historical connections with its imperial predecessor and thereby altered the 20.

Soon after the Republic was proclaimed in 1923, the new regime convened a commission to study a vexing question that had generated considerable controversy over the preceding decades, namely the issue of abolishing Arabic script and adopting Latin script in its stead. The revealing cartoon in figure 7 was published in 1926, as the debates continued. The caption says: "Off with you! Go join the ruins of the Monarchy!" Since the original image is in black and white, it is impossible to determine whether the shading on the face of the man on the right was meant to indicate that he is blushing, or?more likely?if this was a racist reference to the Arab ("darkie" in colloquial Turkish) origins of Arabic script. Certainly his handlebar mustache was meant to connote unfashionable, "oriental" grooming, as opposed to the new clean-shaven, Western look of the time. In 1928, the government officially announced that Latin script would henceforth be used in the Republic of Turkey; indeed, publishing Turkish works in Arabic script was actually criminalized. A cartoon published that very year in the daily Ak?am,23 was subtitled "h/cref"?the Turkish pronunciation of the Arabic word hijrah, which denotes the Prophet's migration from Mecca to Madina in the year 622. Irreverently making light of this momentous occurrence in Islamic history?the very event that became the starting point of the new Islamic calendar?the cartoon shows an anthropomorphic Arabic letter wearing the fez?another rejected relic of the Ottoman past?leading a long procession of Arabic letters, leaving modern Turkey for an undetermined, presumably eastbound, destination. Another cartoon published in 1928 in the daily Cumhuriyet,24 then the semi-official mouthpiece of the Kemalist administration, appeared the day before the obligation to use Latin script went into effect, and depicted a very angular car speeding past a very cursive camel sporting the Arabic letter dal, the first letter of the Turkish word for camel, deve. It was situated atop the following text: The difference between Arabic letters, which we are burying today, and the Turkish letters that we shall start using tomorrow, is as big as that between a camel and a car. Just as the camel, which comes from the deserts of Arabia, is the symbol of primitivity, backwardness, and sluggishness, 23.

One might think that this absolutely remarkable statement, which so unselfconsciously seeks to replace Islam by a new, secular religion of progress centered in the West, was an aberration?little more than enthusiastic hyperbole understandable, perhaps, in the climate of revolutionary fervor that followed the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. Yet a book cover designed and published as recently as 2006 depicts an hourglass in which the passage of time is expressed not as the flow of sand, but as the morphing of the Arabic letters in the upper chamber into Latin letters in the lower one!25 This is as eloquent a representation of the meaning of Arabic script in modern Turkey as one could imagine: Arabic letters signify the past, the Orient, backwardness, sessility, political reaction. Little wonder, then, that the 1928 photograph by Jean Weinberg (fig. 8) depicting the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, teaching citizens Latin script became one of the most celebrated and widely recognized icons of the young nation-state. Calligraphy today So what happened, one might wonder, to the art of calligraphy, so rich and widely practiced during the Ottoman period and so laden with layers and layers of meaning, after Turkey adopted Latin script?26 It is alive 25. The cover in question appeared on the second edition of Recep ?enturk, islam Dunyasmda Modern lesme ve Toplumbilim: Turkiye ve Misir Ornegi (Istanbul: iz Yaymcilik, 2006). The title translates as "Modernization and Sociology in the Muslim World: The Case of Turkey and Egypt/' 26. A questiort that might pose itself is whether or not Latin script has to any degree replaced Arabic script as a medium for beautifully written religious (and other public) texts. Though a small number of calligraphers?notably Emin Barm, Savas ?evik, and Etem ?aliskan (the first two of whom were classically trained in Arabic-script calligraphy as well)?have done considerable work along these lines, overall Arabic script remains the medium of choice. On this point, I wrote some time ago: "The holy mission with which Arabic writing is ...</page><page sequence="10">220 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 Figure 8.

To be sure, there always existed in the Republic of Turkey a counter-culture, and a counter-elite to go with it, that continued to value calligraphy as well as other arts inherited from the Ottoman period. They patronized those calligraphers who did not abandon their craft, published books and articles, and assembled large and precious collections of original works. But to do so without being stigmatized as political reactionaries and enemies of modernity, they had to cloak their passion in the appropriate garb. Thus emerged the idea that in this modern age, calligraphy is not to be read, but rather to be enjoyed as a form of abstract art. The painter Nurullah Berk, who was born in 1906 and therefore surely knew well how to read Arabic script, said that artists such as Kandinsky, Klee, Hartung, and Miro had "extracted new linear forms and compositions from Arabic letters" and thus that "calligraphy, which was a most influential art form in the Muslim East, has been embellished by European artists with various and rich examples of abstract expression." He concluded that "[i]t is no longer necessary to read and understand these inscriptions. Writing has become picture, and what concerns us charged has in turn endowed it with a special status in Islamic culture: the script that preserves the word of God is perceived as a Godly script. In this regard, the identification of Arabic script with the religion of Islam is profound and perhaps unequalled.... By symbolizing Islam, Arabic writing becomes a metonym for the divine order, for the connection between God and His creation." Schick, "Writing the Body in Islam" (see note 4).</page><page sequence="11">Schick: The iconicity of Islamic calligraphy in Turkey 221 in them is their melodic and musical lines, the plastic appearance of their compositions/'27 An apparently apocryphal story also began to circulate around that time, according to which, upon seeing a work of Islamic calligraphy, Picasso had exclaimed: "This is what I have sought to achieve my entire life. This is true modern art." The publisher ?evket Rado, a conservative intellectual who accumulated the largest private collection of Ottoman calligraphy in the world, quoted this statement in his book, and wrote: It has now become clear that the art of Islamic calligraphy, which was for a long time regarded as merely the craft of beautiful writing, is in fact a magical pictorial art that was born more than a thousand years ago and evolved in a totally mystical context. Today, western critics view it... as an art of abstract painting that must be taken seriously.28 In all these statements by authoritative Turkish artists and critics, the role of time is extremely noteworthy. They all say, essentially, that calligraphy used to be writing, but now is abstraction, that it used to be read, but now is only to be contemplated visually. What they did thereby is to exaggerate the pictorial quality of calligraphy, but entirely deny its iconicity, that is, its role as sign. Or perhaps to redefine it as the indicator/index of an Eastern creative genius that had discovered abstract art before Europe had done so?the East as more Western than the West itself. Over time, this attitude has changed. The cultural moment to which it is customary to refer as "the postmodern turn" in Europe and North America has taken different forms in societies outside the Western metropoles, but they have certainly all shared many common elements: a loss of confidence in the metanarrative of modernism; cultural atomization; proliferating experimentation and bricolage with non-mainstream cultures; an inward turn inspired by communalism, nativism, and spirituality; and a growing interest in detemporalized history as part of an eternal present. In this context, calligraphy was suddenly driven back into prominence, but, in the absence of a single dominant culture, it came to be infused with widely different meanings by different cultural communities. On the one hand, collecting Ottoman antiques, and calligraphy in particular, became a class signifier for the newly affluent strata that emerged as a result of the laissez-faire policies of the 1980s and 1990s. The core of the economically and culturally dominant class had been slowly shifting throughout the second half of the twentieth century, as remnants of the late Ottoman and early republican elite, concentrated mainly in the largest cities (particularly Istanbul), were gradually swept aside by provincial upstarts. By the 1990s, these new multimillionaires and even multibillionaires had reached the top of the economic ladder, but they seemed to feel a certain malaise?a need for roots and even legitimacy. This they found in Ottoman antiques. Photographs of such families in their mansions, surrounded by Ottoman opulence in the shadow of calligraphic panels hit the tabloid press daily (fig. 9). For these generally conservative, but for the most part secular collectors, calligraphy was not a matter of religion but of heritage. It was their ticket to a glorious past, not unlike wealthy European commoners who purchased titles from impoverished aristocrats. It should come as no surprise that most of these super-rich collectors made no effort to learn how to read these works; they simply basked in their splendor. Indeed, calligraphic genres like the imperial edict (ferman) and the hilye became status symbols par excellence, because their distinctive forms made them so easy to recognize without the need to read them. Today, such works can fetch several tens of thousands of dollars at auction. It is noteworthy that the children of these first-generation multimillionaires seem to show much less interest in antiques; not prey to the sense of rootlessness or the impostor syndrome apparently felt by their parents, they have found new ways to achieve "distinction" in the sense proposed by Bourdieu.29 In particular, the modern Turkish art market has skyrocketed in recent years. The super-rich were not the only modern Turks to feel the need for forging a new identity not entirely severed from the Ottoman past. A good number of contemporary artists that handsomely deserve the qualification of 29. To the best of my knowledge, this process has not yet been discussed in detail in the scholarly literature. My spouse, the sociologist Nilufer isvan, and I have been engaged in a long-term research project whose results we hope eventually to publish. 27.

"postmodern" began to integrate Ottoman motifs into their works, particularly calligraphy. The painter Erol Akyavaj was the first to do so, thus achieving infinitely greater commercial success than he had done throughout his career. Ergin Inan and Suleyman Saim Tekcan are two other prominent artists who use calligraphy in their work.30 The important point to note here is that their use of calligraphy would never be mistaken for works of calligraphy proper. What they have done is to use calligraphy principally as an element of texture?Nan Freeman has suggested, extremely aptly, I think, that their use of calligraphy is akin to the use of newsprint in Cubist painting.31 The text that they use is inconsequential, and it is not at all unusual for them to write an inscription backward, if the graphic composition warrants it. In their hands, calligraphy has become pure sign. But not icon: At most, it has become symbol. At the same time, Islamic calligraphy has also become something of a rallying point and source of identity 30. Examples of Akyavas's work appear in Erol Akyavas: Yasami ve Yapitlan, ed. Beral Madra and Haldun Dostoglu (Istanbul: Bilgi Oniversitesi Yaymlari, 2000); for inan, see Ferit Edgu, Ergin inan ([istanbul]: Ada Yaymlan, 1988); forTekcan, see Semra Germaner, Suleyman Saim Tekcan: 45 Years of Arts [sic] (Istanbul: Turkiye is Bankasi, 2006). An exhibition was held recently in London, focusing on similar works from elsewhere in the Middle East. Though many of the works in the show were wonderful, the complete absence of Turkish artists among nearly eighty?ranging from Morocco to Iran and even China (!)?is nothing short of incomprehensible.

Thus, Arabic script acts to some degree as a password or "secret handshake" that performs boundary maintenance on the community, distinguishing insiders from outsiders. One of the effects of this new role assumed by Islamic calligraphy in Turkey has been the emergence of a new orthodox formalism?not only in calligraphy, but also in some of the allied arts, particularly illumination and marbling. The neologism "traditional art"33 has emerged as an unchallengeable and unquestionable concept encompassing these diverse fields and endowing them with an inviolability that borders on sacrality. Attitudes toward these arts have become a test of political correctness and even moral rectitude. Underlying this new orthodoxy is a historicist, indeed Darwinian, conception of art according to which styles and techniques evolve in monolinear progression, and the survival of the fittest is accomplished through compatibility and congruence with the "soul of the nation"?a concept that is, of course, never defined. As a result of what we might call "aesthetic Darwinism," the entire history of each so-called "traditional art" is viewed teleologically, a single mainstream practice is recognized as the correct one, and all practices that deviate from it are viewed as undesirable mutations and perversions of the national essence that must be snuffed out, so that the art?and the nation?can be restored to the "correct" course. To give just one example: It is a long-standing practice in calligraphy for a master to give the student a license called icazet (Arabic: ijazah) upon completing the standard course of study. This practice has historically been scrupulously enforced, and, with a handful of exceptions, students who had not yet earned their license were not permitted to sign their work?in other 32. On June 23, 2007, I took part in the Symposium on the Arts of the Book organized by iSMEK, a highly successful program of art education and vocational training associated with the municipality of Istanbul. A good 90 percent of the audience was female, and of those, easily 95 percent were veiled. 33. Traditional arts are generally known in Turkish as geleneksel sanatlar. There is some irony in this, however: The suffixes sel/sal (gelenek+sel is equivalent to tradition+al) are strongly disliked by traditionalists, who view them?and not entirely without justification? as an artificial construct of Republican linguistic engineering. On the other hand, the Ottoman adjective an'anev? is obsolete and very unlikely to replace geleneksel. The term gelenekli sanatlar ("arts with traditions") has recently been proposed by Ugur Derman, and has gained some acceptance within the arts of the book community. words, to function as professional calligraphers. In the art of paper marbling (Turkish: ebru; Persian: abr\), however, there was never such a practice. At least, we currently dispose of no historical evidence whatsoever to indicate that master marblers might have once granted licenses to their apprentices. Be that as it may, in the last decade or two, a small number of Turkish marblers have invented the tradition of granting licenses for marbling.34 This has permitted them to gain a doctrinal. monopoly of sorts over an art that is becoming more popular, and hence less centrally controlled, by the day. There is even a web site in which, by clicking on some links, one can hear the recorded voice of their common teacher, the late Mustafa Duzgunman, describing his methods and recipes.35 The context makes it clear that his is the only legitimate artistic lineage, as far as they are concerned, and for what they consider legitimate marblers, his methods and recipes and they alone are the correct ones. Any experimentation with "nontraditional" pigments, sizes, mordants, or designs is viewed not only as beyond the pale of Turkish marbling, but indeed as a betrayal of it. Yet what constitutes "traditional" materials and techniques derives only from the verbal testimony of a couple of twentieth-century masters of the art, and not from laboratory work and scientific analysis of historical examples. In other words, this tradition?like all others, of course?is merely a modern invention that projects itself into time immemorial. Thus, it is not only through form but also through practice that new meanings have been ascribed to calligraphy and other arts of the book in modern Turkey. Whether a status symbol for the rich, a source of identity for the postmodern, or a test of orthodoxy for Islamists, calligraphy remains a problematic icon in Turkey today, one that has become part of the raging "culture wars." The daily Hurriyet reported on September 21, 2005, that, as a bit of "happening" or conceptual art, some unidentified persons suddenly unfurled a large banner in the Karakoy neighborhood 34. For examples of these documents, some of which curiously blend traditionalist verbiage with recent-vintage nationalism, see Muin Nursen Eris, Mustafa Esat Duzgunman and Ebru (Istanbul: istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyesi Kultur A. ?. Yaymlan, 2007), pp. 164-165, 176-177. 35. The URL of this site, maintained by the marbler Alparslan Babaoglu, is http://www.gelenekselebru.com/. There is also an English version of the site, but it is incomplete. In particular, the hyperpolemical pages entitled Reddiye (refutation) in the Turkish section remain untranslated. The Turkish section even includes a ?ehadetname (testimonial) from Duzgunman's son attesting to the fact that the information presented therein is faithful to his father's practices.</page><page sequence="14">224 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 of downtown Istanbul. On it were two pieces of calligraphy, both in Turkish. One said gel keyfim gel, which is more or less untranslatable but could best be described as an invocation to pleasure, to hedonism. The other said bu da geger ya HQ, which roughly means "Lord, this too shall pass." Both, in other words, were nonpolitical, secular, and entirely unthreatening expressions that any average Turk might have uttered on a suitable occasion.36 Alas, people in the street below could not read them. They interpreted the banner as some sort of Islamist battle cry, and much anxiety was reportedly experienced, until the municipality ordered it removed?a tragicomical twist in the saga of Islamic calligraphy in Turkey. Indeed, this saga shows the art, taken in toto, to have had a powerfully indexical quality, particularly during the Republican period. Its suppression, reemergence, redefinition, and reappropriation provide clues as to the profound sociocultural transformations that have taken place since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. 36. When I presented this material at MIT, Caroline Jones wondered if "Lord, this too shall pass" might not be intended as a response to the invocation to pleasure above it?that is, if it might not represent a conservative rejoinder to the hedonistic practices of modern society. Though I agree that this possibility cannot be ruled out, I strongly doubt it, as the phrase bu da geger ya HQ does not have such a censorious connotation in Turkish.</page></plain_text>
