Pp. x + 246. $28. Scholarly paradigms suggested by Israel Knohl are used by Jacob Milgrom in his magisterial commentary on Leviticus. Now, at last, in this revised and expanded translation of a monograph published in Hebrew in 1992, the English-speaking world has access to K.'s ideas. His thesis, simply stated, is that the Priestly tradition, which he calls PT (Priestly Torah), was actually earlier than the Holiness Code and related literature, which he calls HS (Holiness School). He maintains that when scholars assimilate the Holiness Code to the supposedly later P material, as they do so often, they fail to see that much of P really belongs to a greater Holiness tradition. Knohl begins by carefully analyzing the composition of Leviticus 23 to demon- strate the priority of PT and the way HS adds the final editorial comments. He then assigns material to PT and HS in texts of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, attributing much to HS, including much that is often viewed as JE. In separate chapters he evaluates the theology of PT and HS. PT uses the ancient cultus language in a very abstract and sophisticated manner. In PT anthropomorphic imagery of God is elimi- nated, worship in the temple is idealized as ceremony done in complete silence in the interior sanctuary (hence the title of K.'s book), běrít is used for religion before Moses and cêdût for the religion of Moses, and the numinous nature of God is stressed in esoteric fashion. True holiness comes only from God and resides in the sanctuary; people must avoid impurity above all. By contrast, in HS language of PT is used, but priestly themes are interwoven with issues of social justice and aspects of popular piety. In HS God is spoken of more directly, imperatives for social reform are inte- grated, and holiness is expanded into the social realm. The whole community is called to lead a life sanctified by obedience to the commandments. In HS, with the stress on popular piety, the Day of Atonement is created and the Sabbath is emphasized. Holiness is expanded to the people, who now maintain separateness from the nations. Knohl wisely suggests that the traditions in PT and HS developed over several centuries, in both the preexilic and postexilic eras. He also suggests that there was interaction between PT and HS, and that D interacted with both. Ultimately, how- ever, K. theorizes concrete historical origins. In HS one finds opposition to idolatry, especially the cult of Molech and soothsaying, to social polarization resulting from the uprooting of peasant farmers, and to the detachment of morality from worship. In HS there is awareness of mass exile and of the reforming tendency to centralize worship. For K., this points to the era of Ahaz and Hezekiah in Judah. He notes that Hezekiah and HS both oppose high places and altars but not cultic places in them- selves (as Josiah would a century later). HS reflects the eighth-century prophetic criticism of worship and contains notions of holiness similar to those in Isaiah. Foreign cults, including the worship of Molech, came to Judah in the years of Assy- rian expansion, the notion of cëdût was introduced in the time of Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria (745-727 b.c.e.), and mass deportations would be the experience of Samaria in 722 b.c.e. Since tradition in PT is older than HS, K. places its beginnings in the era after Solomon's construction of the temple.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 741 Knohl has some other agenda in his exposition, too, as he evaluates previous scholarship. He is most critical of Wellhausen for dating P so late and for failing to appreciate its sophistication. He favorably quotes the ideas of Kaufmann, though he criticizes Kaufmann for failing to admit the existence of popular elements in P tra- dition. Finally, he sees the tension between PT and HS enduring in later theological positions. HS embraces the popular world theologically, as would the later Pharisees and rabbis, while ideas in PT resemble the esoteric teachings of Qumran and the Sadducees. Knohl's arguments are compelling, especially as he works out his thesis in the analysis of key texts, but not all will be convinced by his arguments. One could view his texts and see the development of HS and PT in a different fashion. The attribution of so many passages to HS appears to have been done rather quickly and, at times, too easily. Most critics will be cautious in facing his early dates. The connections that he sees between HS and the era of Hezekiah could be connections with the Baby- lonian exile as well, especially since such themes are common in the traditions of D. He has a desire to find an early date for the traditions of P, and that reflects his indebtedness to Kaufmann. Nonetheless, this work is a landmark. K.'s arguments must be taken seriously, and scholars in pentateuchal research will struggle with them for years. Robert Gnuse, Loyola University of the South, New Orleans, LA 70118</page></plain_text>
