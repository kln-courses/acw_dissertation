<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOWLER, PETER J. [1984]: Evolution: The History of an Idea. University of California Press. Pp. xiv+412. (Hardback $29-95) (ISBN 0-520-04880-6). This book is intended as an introductory survey of the history of evolutionary theories and their social and other implications, particularly as a text for university courses in the history of science, but also as a concise guide to historians. It includes a 55-page bibliography of accessible primary sources and an up-to-date listing of a wide range of secondary sources on this topic. The book succeeds admirably in achieving its aims, and it would also be most useful as a source book and guide to this historical literature for readers of this journal. Bowler offers a predominantly conceptual history of evolution, and he makes insightful and important points regarding historical variations on key evolutionary concepts, such as those of taxonomical relation and succession, species, variety and inheritance. Little attention is paid to biographies of the persons discussed or to the growth of scientific institutions relevant to the conduct or support of scientific research, though 'external' relations such as social origins of certain concepts and the ethical and social ramifications of biological theories are discussed with attention to a balanced presentation of various viewpoints. Conceptual history illuminates the course of the history of science in a way especially interesting to the philosopher because, in addition to being influenced by the practical and empirical success of these enterprises, conceptual systems support certain scientific enterprises and exclude others. This heuristic role of conceptualisation in scientific develop- ment is well illustrated in the various developments Bowler has chosen to describe.</page><page sequence="2">262 The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science What is unique about this work is its scope and balance. Like others, such as Greene [1959], Bowler describes developments of views that are epistemically auxiliary to evolutionary biology in the fields of cosmology and geology, as well as the history of certain concepts central to taxonomy and natural history, such as linear, multilinear and branching patterns, with or without hierarchical, anthropomorphic or other value-laden interpre- tations, and in historical or temporalised versus idealistic versions (see especially Chapter 3). Especially helpful in regard to taxonomy is the inclusion of well drawn and captioned diagrams. Like Ruse [ 1974], but with more detail regarding social and philosophical sources, Bowler discusses the social, philosophical and religious context in which Darwin found himself in England, as well as the continental idealist tradition in taxonomy, comparat- ive anatomy, paleontology and goal-directed evolution, and its contribution to, in spite of its incompatibility with, Darwinism (Chapter 4). Also included is an extended treatment of the neo-Lamarckian movement appearing late in the nineteenth and early in the twentieth centuries, which, according to Bowler, was motivated by moral objections to the cruelty of natural selection and a lingering preference for final causes in nature, was not hindered by Weismann's germ plasm theory, and was never unequivo- cally supported by experiment (Chapters 8, 9). Bowler's book is further distinguished by moderate but plausible externalist historiographical position (Chapter 6), an insightful chapter on the social and ethical implications of Darwinism (Chapter io), an account of the evolutionary synthesis of the I930os and 1940s which solved many of the problems either known to Darwin or raised by Lamarckian and saltationist rivals to Darwinism (Chapter i i), and finally recent developments such as further Lamarckian, punctuationist, cladist and creationist challenges (Chapter i ). Bowler thus covers a lot of ground. Clearly much that is useful and relevant must be left out, particularly the citation of primary sources and other details such as the now well known succession of search, trial, self- appraisal, reformulation and synthesis in Darwin's 'Notebooks on the Transmutation of Species'. However, some of these omissions are at the expense of vagueness and others obscure methodologically significant points about the history of evolutionary theories. Some of Bowler's claims, particularly concerning the social origins of Darwinism, on first impression seem to be both vague and unsubstantiated. For example, Bowler claims that social thought in early-nineteenth-century Britain was patently influential in the development of Darwin's ideas on natural selection even though the problems he addressed himself to were internal to natural history and geology (pp. I43ff.). Bowler tells us, rather vaguely, that 'the individualism of the laissez faire school almost certainly is reflected in Darwin's decision to treat biological species as a population of diverse organisms rather than copies of an ideal type' (p. 95), which he claims is evident from Darwin's wide reading in the political and economic literature of his day (p. I45). The relation of 'influence' between Darwin's</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 263 social philosophy is much clarified in the secondary literature cited by Bowler, particularly in Schweber's claim [I977] that Darwin's interest in instincts, habits and emotions in animals, on the one hand, and in the evolution of a stable moral order for humans, on the other, generates support for a metaphysical view that places man in the evolutionary process (cf. Darwin's 'Notebooks on Transmutation', BI3I, C76-8o, C154). Thus, in place of the vague 'influence' one can identify a specific relation of relevance between Darwin's general evolutionary interests and the study of the social environment and its relation to the individual. In this light the connection between social thought and Darwin's evolutionary thinking is one of analogical inference: If there is no essential difference between humans and other animals, particularly the apes or others manifesting seemingly mental attributes, then characteristics of individual activity bearing upon the development and maintenance of a social and moral order in the former ought to be found bearing upon the generation and maintenance of adapted breeding populations in the latter as well. Given the metaphysical assump- tion of continuity between humans and non-humans, the analogy might rationally warrant Darwin's seeking something corresponding to Adam Smith's individual self interest in non-human organisms, and the same line of reasoning would warrant the importation of Malthus' population pressure and struggle against disease, famine, etc. into biology. However, Darwin only mentions Adam Smith in the 'M Notebook', and there is no explicit summary or discussion of Adam Smith's individualism in either the 'M Notebook' or the 'Notebooks on Transmutation'. Hence Bowler's claim about Adam Smith's influence lacks the explicit substantiation available for the common claims about the influence of Malthus on Darwin's search for a theory of species transmutation. Bowler suggests, with others such as DeBeer and Ghiselin, that Darwin's discoveries are products of the 'hypothetico-deductive method' (pp. 14, 146, zoz). However, he seems unaware of the tension between this concession and the account he gives of Darwin's research in the years 1836- 9. Although he acknowledges the contributions of Darwin scholarship during this period, he offers very little specific detail regarding the content or the development of the ideas recorded in the 'Notebooks on Transmutation' or in the records of Darwin's field work in South America. Hence there is little specific documentation regarding the 'logic' of Darwin's theoretical discoveries. Darwin's early commitment to the view that speciation must be through the process of natural reproduction is incom- patible with hypothetico-deductivism, according to which scientific innov- ation is achieved through the substantially (though not logically) un- constrained production of trial hypotheses to be tested only against empirically established facts. Darwin's rationale for choosing problems and strategies in his search for a theory of speciation (his logic of discovery) and the arguments he offers in its defence (his logic of justification) hardly fit Popper's and Hempel's model for the discovery process. Rather, evidence</page><page sequence="4">264 The British Journalfor the Philosophy of Science especially from the 'Notebooks on Transmutation' and the 'M' and 'N' notebooks on 'Man, Mind and Materialism' supports the view that his search was for explanatory patterns of a prescribed kind, particularly patterns presupposing continuity between human and non-human species and appealing to variations produced through reproduction and preserved through various isolating mechanisms, such as geographical and be- havioural isolation. Darwin's arguments against the intelligibility of natural theological accounts of speciation are significant as a first step in the preparation of the abductive arguments, i.e. arguments to the best expla- nation, that Darwin will use both for working hypotheses and for the final product of his search, the theory of evolution by natural selection. Bowler implicitly acknowledges the import of the argument from explanatory power (abduction) in the reception of Darwin's theory (p. 178), though this important form of scientific argument is never mentioned in Bowler's methodological discussions. Interestingly, in his excellent appraisal of recent 'scientific creationism', Bowler offers just the arguments that both Darwin and Wallace offered against natural theological theories of speci- ation and in favour of their position regarding the kind of explanation to be sought for speciation, viz. arguments appealing to the superior epistemic accessibility, coherence with theories in other relevant domains, and explanatory adequacy and the relative lack of arbitrariness in the naturalistic explanatory scheme (pp. 344ff.). Bowler also clearly delineates the methodological deficiencies of natural selection in the light of mid-nineteenth century knowledge and observ- ational capability. The theory conflicted with Kelvin's highly credible (but false) thermodynamic studies of the rate of the earth's cooling, thus raising a problem in which the evidence from external incoherence is in conflict with geological evidence from stratigraphy and erosion (p. I94). Nageli had pointed out that many of the characters distinguishing closely related species had no apparent adaptive value (p. 196). Mivart raised questions about the adaptive value of intermediates in the selective process by which functional organs were supposed to have developed (p. 197). Darwin's eventual commitment to sympatric variation made him vulnerable to Jenkin's argument that such variants should blend out by crossing with non- variants in the population (p. 199). Darwin was unable to provide a cause or a suitable mechanism for the production or transmission of variant characteristics (p. 204). Natural selection is not exemplified in any immediately observable process, and hence the theory lacks observational 'proof' (p. zoo). Some historians have suggested that Darwin became increasingly aware that natural selection cannot be reconciled with tradi- tional theology, even the deism that would allow God's benevolence to be achieved indirectly through natural laws (p. zo8). The absence of any defensible notion of progress in the successive products of evolution undermined the view that the sacrifice of individuals in the struggle for existence is for an overall good. This produced tensions not just between</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 265 evolutionists and theologians of the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also in the minds of scientists who found Darwin's materialism 'distasteful' or morally objectionable, and disposed these scientists to reconsider teleological evolutionary mechanisms such as Lamarckism (pp. 20o8, 214, 244). These seemingly legitimate objections should focus the interest of the philosopher on what, if any, methodological virtues natural selection had which would warrant the tenacity of the Darwinians, tenacity which in retrospect was successful if not rationally justified (cf. Feyerabend [19741). The eventual success of the 'evolutionary synthesis', as Bowler presents it, can be viewed as solving or contributing to the solution of the above mentioned problems facing the original form of natural selection theory. These developments are exactly what one would expect from a research programme deliberately directed at eliminating the epistemic deficiencies of Darwin's theory, although Bowler does not provide the kind of evidence that would establish the particular objectives of the authors of the synthesis. The multiple gene hypothesis, the mathematical studies of the spread of advantaged genes through and the maintenance of genetic variation within breeding populations, new support for isolation of subpopulations as a source for evolutionarily significant variation, and statistical methods in paleontology answered some of Darwin's questions about the causes of variation and brought to bear the highly productive field of Mendelian and population genetics, as well as molecular biology and paleontology, as evidence that Jenkin's objections could be answered (pp. 289-300). In sum, the few shortcomings of this book in clarity and evidence and in the discussion of methodology are far outweighed by its scope and overall adequacy to the subject undertaken. The final section on creationism should be required reading in all introductory philosophy classes, especially in the 'bible belt' of the USA! SCOTT A.
