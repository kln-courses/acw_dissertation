<plain_text><page sequence="1">Human Heart, Heavenly Heart: Mystical Dimensions of Chu Hsi's Neo-Confucianism Jonathan R. Herman Despite the fact that Chu Hsi, the twelfth-century philosopher, educa- tor, and canonical redactor, is identified with the rational wing of Neo- Confucianism, there is also a distinctly intuitive and idealistic side to Chu Hsi's writings, one that is essential to his overall teaching but is seldom given proportionate attention. This article examines one specific aspect of Chu Hsi's works that may, in part, be legitimately characterized as "mystical" and considers some of the implications of such a determina- tion. The pivotal point of discussion is Chu Hsi's identification of the human heart and mind with both the heart-mind of heaven and earth and the heart-mind of the sage. IT IS WIDELY recognized in Sinological circles that Chu Hsi, the twelfth- century philosopher, educator, and canonical redactor, represents the rational wing of the broad intellectual movement known in the West as Neo-Confucianism. Indeed, Chu Hsi's "School of Principle" (li-hsieh), with its emphases on incremental learning and systematic "investigation of things" (ko-wu), seems especially sober and analytical when compared with the rival "School of Mind" (hsin-hsUeh) of Lu Hsiang-shan and Wang Yang-ming and its controversial Buddhist-influenced offshoot, the T'ai- chou School. Nevertheless, there is also a distinctly intuitive and idealis- tic side to Chu Hsi's writings, one that is essential to his overall teaching but is seldom given proportionate attention. In this article, I will exam- ine one specific aspect of Chu Hsi's works that may, in part, be legitimately Jonathan R.

Given a certain methodological carelessness that sometimes occurs in studies of mysticism, not to mention the recent history of acrimonious debate on the subject, I propose at the onset that it is necessary to estab- lish some workable technical parameters for the purposes of this article. First, it should be made clear exactly how the term mysticism is being employed, that is, exactly what is being claimed by an assertion that Chu Hsi was a "mystic" or that his writings are "mystical." The most compre- hensive, historically applicable, and theologically neutral definition of mysticism that I have found thus far is one offered, perhaps inadvertently, by Sinologist and comparativist Lee Yearley, who succinctly identifies "mystical experience as an experience that the experiencer believes reflects contact with a higher reality or with the true character of reality" (130). The operative words and phrases of this definition, as I understand it, are experience, higher reality, and true character ofreality. While this may seem like an almost tautological observation, it is crucial to note that mysticism as a descriptive category refers first and foremost to experience (as op- posed to doctrine or praxis); to something that is closer to perception than conception; to the domains of feeling and sensing, rather than those of believing, deducing, positing, or even (in the aesthetic sense of the word) imagining. Thus, it is not appropriate to label a complex metaphysical treatise or theosophical speculation mystical simply because it is paradoxi- cal, not entirely rational, or boasting "transcendent" insights. Moreover, merely identifying without qualification any text-or, for that matter, any novel, play, dance, or painting-as mystical is, necessarily, ambiguous and requires more hermeneutic specificity. The locus of mysticism is the ex- perience of the person; when applying that label to a text, one must make clear if the words on the page supposedly represent or express experiences of the author, or if they somehow inspire such experiences on the part of the reader, or if they spell out a discipline that allows the reader to have such experiences, or if there is in any way some other human experience to which they refer. The other important aspect of Yearley's definition is that it refers to contact with a "higher reality" or with the "true character of reality," that the particular experience or experiences are for the experiencer both quali- tatively different from ordinary experience and profoundly authoritative and significant. This somewhat echoes William James's conception of "noesis," the idea that the experience entails a compelling sense of a height- ened awareness or insight (380-381). It should be noted that there is a major advantage to such unspecific language, as it says nothing about</page><page sequence="3">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 105 matters of "oneness," "union," "transcendence," "God," or anything else reflective of a particular theological agenda. A second methodological concern is the question of what is actually at stake in identifying Chu Hsi as a mystic or his writings as mystical. Contrary to what one might expect, and despite the common misconcep- tion that Taoism is mystical while Confucianism is "practical," there is no reason to believe that a mystical component to Chu Hsi's works nec- essarily transcends, supercedes, or even contradicts other aspects of his philosophy. As has been argued convincingly in a series of landmark (though still controversial) volumes edited by Steven Katz (1978, 1983b, 1992, 2000), all experience-even mystical experience-is contextually bound and thus intelligible only contextually. That is to say, any particu- lar occurrence of mysticism can only be fully understood when it is ex- amined in its historical, cultural, social, and, perhaps most importantly, linguistic contexts. Thus, a specific historical example of mystical experi- ence is best viewed not as an autonomous accretion to a sui generis reli- gious phenomenon (i.e., "mysticism") but as a constitutive ingredient within a particular, multifaceted contextual complex (i.e., a particular his- torical tradition). Moreover, just as the broader contexts help make the particular accessible, the particular may also elucidate the broader con- texts. Thus, the argument that aspects of Chu Hsi's works may be classi- fied as mysticism does not confer on him membership in a cross-cultural company of "mystical illuminati";' rather, it asserts that there is evidence of a distinct experiential dimension, which is not only interesting in and of itself but also is useful for broadening both the overall discourse on Chu Hsi's particular Confucian vision and the current conversations on the study of mysticism.2 THE HEART AND MIND OF HEAVEN AND EARTH: TRANSFORMING AND NOURISHING Studies of Neo-Confucian metaphysics and self-cultivation ordinarily begin with an elaborate network of philosophical propositions. The start- ing point is the idea that the mechanisms of the universe are undergirded by a single principle (li) of coherence, which is manifest cosmologically 1 The term mystical illuminati is respectfully borrowed from an unpublished essay by Robert M. Gimello, originally presented at the 1990 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Religion. 2 Thus far, few scholars have considered modern developments in the academic study of mysti- cism in their treatments of Confucian religious experience. For a contribution that is atypical in its methodological self-consciousness, see Ng.</page><page sequence="4">106 Journal of the American Academy of Religion as the "great ultimate" (t'ai-chi), theologically as "heaven" (t'ien), exis- tentially as "destiny" (ming), and ethically as "the way" (tao). One of the innovations of this synthesis of established Confucian terminology is that the natural is not seen as distinct from the ethical; the principle by which the planets revolve in their orbits and the seasons follow in a cyclical manner is the same principle by which a ruler cares for the well-being of his or her subjects and a child obeys his or her parents. As Chu Hsi states aphoristically (echoing Ch'eng I, his eleventh-century forerunner) in a passage that is quoted repeatedly in almost any work on Confucian meta- physics, "Principle is one; its manifestations are diverse" (1986: 2/7).3 Furthermore, this singular principle is impressed on each human being as human nature (hsing), which, in accord with the now "orthodox" in- terpretations of the fourth-century B.C.E. philosopher Mencius, com- prises four incipient virtuous qualities-"humanheartedness" (jen), right- ness (i), propriety (li), and wisdom (chih)-that can be cultivated through the efforts of the "heart-mind" (hsin).4 Of course, the context for and ultimate product of this cultivation are nothing other than what is now recognizable as the Confucian idea of culture (wen), the entire Chinese repository of refined moral, aesthetic, social, and historical resources. I am not inclined to dispute this representation of Chu Hsi's positions, but I suggest that it may be fruitful to redirect the conversation slightly. One often overlooked aspect of this elaborate system is that Chu Hsi as- cribes to heaven and earth-to the workings of the cosmos itself-the quality of heart-mind and that he implicitly identifies the human heart- mind-the agent of personal cultivation-with this cosmic heart-mind. The phrase itself, the heart-mind of heaven and earth (t'ien-ti chih hsin), dates back to the I Ching, but it had been only recently revived in the early Neo-Confucian discourse, showing up in the writings of Ch'eng I, Hu Hung, and Chang Shih in particular.5 Current scholars have given some attention to this subject, focusing largely on Chu Hsi's celebrated "Trea- tise on Humanheartedness" (Jen-shuo), which begins by quoting Ch'eng 3 In keeping with established conventions for citing materials translated from the Chinese, new translations of passages from Conversations of Master Chu, Arranged Topically (Chu-tzu yia-lei) are cited by both page and line numbers. Translations from this text are my own unless otherwise speci- fied. 4The classical Chinese character hsin normally suggests qualities associated with both "heart" and "mind," connoting, as Tu Wei-ming notes, "conative as well as cognitive and affective mean- ings" (1985e: 70). In order to preserve this multivalent aspect of the term, I translate it throughout the essay with the deliberately cumbersome "heart-mind." 5 Chu Hsi also makes some reference simply to the heart-mind of heaven (t'ien-hsin) and even to the heart-mind of the way (tao-hsin), though this article focuses exclusively on the heart-mind of heaven and earth. Because the phrase "heaven and earth" is more or less a shorthand for the cosmos as a whole, I treat it as a singular collective noun.</page><page sequence="5">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 107 I's statement that "heaven and earth takes the producing of things as its heart-mind, and, moreover, in the producing of persons and things, each receives this heart-mind of heaven and earth and takes it to be his/her/its heart-mind."6 Stanislaus Lokuang, for example, cites the passage princi- pally to reinforce his thesis on Chu Hsi's conflation of metaphysical and moral structures, of ontology and ethics (71); whereas Ren Jiyu does so in order to demonstrate that Chu Hsi's teaching carries implications more significant to matters of practice and action than to philosophical specu- lation (365-366). Sato Hitoshi, in reconstructing the protracted debate that occurred around this portion of the treatise (mainly between Chu Hsi and Chang Shih), is interested chiefly in exploring the various nu- ances of Chu Hsi's theory of humanheartedness (219-220). Most recently, Michael C. Kalton extends the conversation to develop a set of compari- sons and contrasts between the concepts of jen and agape (220-238). But, overall, these discussions of the heart-mind of heaven and earth are rela- tively brief and not especially relevant to the types of experiential issues that are the concern of this article. On the other hand, a handful of authors do suggest the germination of such a line of inquiry, though not yet with the critical apparatus of the modern study of mysticism. In an ambitious and virtually comprehen- sive study of Chu Hsi, philosopher and historian of philosophy Wing-tsit Chan frames his discussion within the larger problem of understanding the nature of heaven, which he brings to bear on the question of how the individual person attains sagehood (1989: 171-194). Similarly, intellec- tual historian Hoyt Cleveland Tillman considers exactly what aspects of heaven Chu Hsi brings into focus by introducing more anthropomorphic, less naturalistic phrases such as "the heart-mind of heaven" or "the heart- mind of heaven and earth." In one instance, he concludes that heaven "was traditionally associated with dynamic life-giving and organismic union of people with the moral and life-giving order of the cosmos; hence, these qualities could be seen as relevant in positing a 'self-correcting mecha- nism' to bridge the ethical breach that so easily occurred in actual, indi- viduated entities" (1987: 49). In any event, a similarly provocative albeit brief discussion of the heart- mind of heaven and earth is found not within the often quoted "Treatise on Humanheartedness" but in the opening chapter of Conversations of Master Chu, Arranged Topically (Chu-tzu yii-lei), ostensibly a series of reflections on the relationship between principle and its manifestations within the realm of "psycho-physical stuff' (ch'i) and between the great 6 This treatise appears in the Collected Literary Works of Master Chu (Hui-an hsien-sheng Chu Wen-kung wen-chi) (n.d.: 67:21b-22b).

Here, in a dialogical format, Chu Hsi is pushed to define the phrase more carefully, and suggests his motivation for including it in the new Neo-Confucian lexicon, thus moving into some previously uncharted territory. In the very first and perhaps most signifi- cant reference he considers the issue of "spiritual efficacy" (ling), the mysterious and perhaps numinous quality ordinarily associated with ghosts and spirits (kuei-shen) that is palpably felt in the human realm:7 It was asked whether the heart-mind of heaven and earth is indeed spiritually efficacious, or if it is only indifferent and takes no action. Chu Hsi replied, "One cannot say that the heart-mind of heaven and earth is not spiritually efficacious, but this is not to say that it compares in any way to human cogitation and volition. I-ch'uan said, 'Heaven and earth is without heart-mind and yet is transformative; the sagely person pos- sesses heart-mind and yet takes no action."' (1986: 4/5-6) Here Chu Hsi is attempting to thread a delicate theological or meta- physical needle. On the one hand, he is reluctant to characterize the work- ings of heaven and earth as purely mechanistic, no doubt wary, as Tillman explains, that a "notion of a transcendent mind would lead to the empti- ness and quietude of Taoism and Buddhism" (1992: 75). In particular, he seems to be rejecting Lao Tzu's classical formulation of a universe that functions disinterestedly, that treats the ten thousand as "straw dogs" (57). His language is cautious, but he does tend toward acknowledging some type of sentience or analogue to sentience, some type of drive that informs the changing configurations of heaven and earth. On the other hand, he is also adamant that the heart-mind of heaven and earth is, in at least some manner, qualitatively different from the human heart-mind and the heart- mind of spiritual beings, that its possession of some type of ling does not necessitate that it operates deliberatively, reflectively, or consciously (or conscientiously). The brief citation from Ch'eng I, which appears initially to contradict what Chu Hsi had just said, is most likely offered as a constructive juxta- position in order to highlight this ambiguity. The statement that heaven and earth does not possess heart-mind, which Chu Hsi conditionally ech- oes elsewhere (Tillman 1987: 41), essentially reinforces the claim that the spiritually efficacious aspect of heaven and earth should not be conceived anthropomorphically, not as the thinking, feeling, willing, involved human 7 Drawing from Rudolf Otto's legacy, Joseph A. Adler is comfortable translating the term ling simply as "numinous" in an essay in a forthcoming volume on Confucian spirituality, in which he goes on to argue that "'pure numinous awareness' . . . is thus characteristic of [psycho-physical stuff] itself' (Tu and Tucker). Ling has elsewhere been mistranslated as "conscious," which is par- ticularly misleading. See Kalton: 228.</page><page sequence="7">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 109 heart-mind with which we are much more familiar, not even the sponta- neously moral heart-mind of the sage. And yet heaven and earth is trans- formative, indicating that the generation and perpetuation of the uni- verse-what third-century B.C.E. philosopher Hstin Tzu called "the great transformations of yin and yang" (yin-yang ta-hua) follow from some type of cosmic impetus.8 As mentioned earlier, principle is simultaneously natural and ethical; and, according to Chu Hsi, it is not merely a general- ized designation for a mechanical or perfunctory process. This principle is truly brought into existence-made manifest in the ch'i, to invoke the more technical lexicon-by virtue of the heart-mind that is possessed by heaven and earth. In this ongoing dialectic between the spiritual efficacy and the quasi-Taoist detachment of the cosmic heart-mind Chu Hsi sug- gests that there is a coherent and intelligible direction to the great trans- formations of yin and yang, yet he stops well short of assigning a telos or a tangible purpose to it. The dialogue continues: "Someone asked about the heart-mind of heaven and earth and the principle of heaven and earth, if the principle is the principle of the way and the heart-mind is the basic intent of a lord and master. Chu Hsi replied, 'The heart-mind is certainly the basic in- tent of a lord and master, but that which is the so-called lord and master is simply principle. It is not the case that there can be a principle external to and separate from the heart-mind, or a heart-mind external to and separate from principle"' (1986: 4/7-8). This offers something of a paral- lel with the previously cited passage, but instead of considering the mat- ter with regard to spiritual efficacy, Chu Hsi entertains the applicability of explicitly theistic language. Again, Chu Hsi does not deny the value of the metaphor, though he adds a predictable measure of ambiguity. On the one hand, the great transformations of yin and yang do not simply happen; they follow from something that is more ontologically primary, something that is in some way analogous to the intention of a ruling or regulating power. But, on the other hand, that which is now being charac- terized in anthropomorphic language is also identified as nothing other than that quality of singular universal principle that makes manifesta- tion possible. However articulated, the creative quality of heaven and earth is still undergirded by the same principle of cosmic and moral co- herence. In more technical language (and at some risk of becoming 8 As it actually appears in context, Hstin Tzu's single reference to yin-yang ta-hua probably fol- lows the classical topic-comment structure and translates more accurately as "the yin and yang go through their great transformations," though later references by others to the "Great Transforma- tion" or the "great transformations" almost certainly are evoking this phrase. See Hstin Tzu: 80 and Tu 1985b: 38-40.</page><page sequence="8">110 Journal of the American Academy of Religion overly jargonistic), from the standpoint of ontology, the great transfor- mations of yin and yang are rooted in principle; the ontological basis of the ongoing processes of heaven and earth, the criterion that confers order and intelligibility to the cosmos, is principle. This is a restatement of what might be called Chu Hsi's ontological primacy of principle, which causes him to remark that "principle is the foundation" (1986: 2/9). But from the standpoint of existence, the configurations of time and space become manifest only by virtue of the impetus of the heart-mind of heaven and earth. Existential status is conferred on any configuration of ch'i, but it is the heart-mind of heaven and earth that in some sense transmits and trans- lates principle into manifestation. In other words, the existential realiza- tion of diverse manifestations of principle is predicated on the impetus of the heart-mind of heaven and earth. This may be an interesting and sophisticated metaphysic in and of itself, but the most significant practical implications follow from Chu Hsi's contention that there is some kind of identification possible between the individual person's heart-mind and the heart-mind of heaven and earth. This is frequently attributed to the human heart-mind's capacity for human- heartedness (Tillman 1992: 125-126), but it is also noteworthy that Chu Hsi, during a discussion of principle and human nature, maintains that the heart-mind is the locus of human spiritual efficacy as well.9 That is to say, the quality associated with the creative aspect of heaven and earth is likewise associated with the creativity of the human heart-mind. But re- gardless of how Chu Hsi casts the image, it reinforces the idea that the highest fulfillment of the human heart-mind is somehow its identifica- tion with the heart-mind of heaven and earth. Cosmic impetus is thus the ideal archetype for human will; human beings are thus charged to par- ticipate in the life process of the cosmos: "Heaven and earth generalizes and extends its heart-mind to the ten thousand things. Human beings obtain this and bring it to completion as the human heart-mind. Things obtain this and bring it to completion as the heart-mind of things. Grass and trees, birds and beasts receive it, and set it forth to completion as the heart-mind of grass and trees, birds and beasts. These are nothing but the heart-mind of heaven and earth" (Chu Hsi 1986: 5/3-4). The implication of this is striking, for it raises the stakes of Confucian learning considerably. Human cultivation is not only the "secular" pro- cess of realizing innate human virtue and finding its proper cultural expression; it is also the "cosmic" process of recapitulating the spiritual 9 As recorded in Conversations, "It was asked if the locus of spiritual efficacy is the heart-mind or if it is human nature. Chu Hsi replied, 'The locus of spiritual efficacy is only the heart-mind; human nature is only principle"' (1986: 85/1).</page><page sequence="9">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 111 efficacy of heaven and earth. To complete the equation, through the iden- tification of the human heart-mind with the heart-mind of heaven and earth, the way of the responsible person serves to participate in the great transformations of yin and yang. In a reference to his "Treatise on Human- heartedness" and an allusion back to both the I Ching and the Confucian Analects, Chu Hsi states, "When a scholar disciplines himself in overcom- ing the ego and returning to propriety to the point of eliminating ego- centric desires completely, then his [heart-]mind is purely this [heart-] mind of Heaven and Earth giving life to things" (Tillman 1992: 79). In many ways, this represents the culmination of the Neo-Confucian agenda, the most reasonable extension of the aforementioned synthesis of the natural and the ethical. It also helps shed light on a key passage from the metaphysically tinged Doctrine of the Mean (Chung-yung)-one of the "four books" canonized by Chu Hsi-wherein the anonymous author ultimately ties the development of human "sincerity" (ch'eng) and the "full development of one's nature" to the ability to "assist the transforming and nourishing powers of heaven and earth" and thus form "a triad with heaven and earth" (chapter 22).10 Confucian scholar Tu Wei-ming writes, "To be sure, sagehood as a mode of experience rather than as an abstract principle is not devoid of psychological and ethical implications. Yet since it is as much an idea about ultimate reality as one about the deepest meaning of human existence, it should be understood and appreciated from a much broader perspective. Indeed, no matter how much weight one puts on the psychological and ethical dimensions of it, sagehood in Neo-Confucian thought is always grounded in a metaphysical structure" (1985c: 153). At this juncture, it would appear that Chu Hsi's model of personal development satisfies at least part of Yearley's working definition of mys- ticism. To identify one's own heart-mind with that of heaven and earth, to assist heaven and earth in its processes of transformation and nurture, and to join humankind with heaven and earth in a triad of sorts certainly characterize a process of cultivating one's human heart-mind well beyond its conventional function and achieving knowledge of a higher reality or the true character of reality. Of course, it is not clear whether Chu Hsi maintains that humans ever achieve such a state in a finite lifetime or if he is presenting this as something of an intellectual and ethical desidera- 10 Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century scholar Chang Po-hsing makes a similar point, though with a somewhat evangelical spin: "The mind of heaven and earth is to produce and reproduce and transform the myriad things, and their nature and destiny are thereby correct. Confucians also make this their mind, assisting and participating in the process of nourishing things, bringing order throughout heaven and earth, and making sure that man really fulfills his nature to the best of his ability" (Chan 1989: 194). The translation from The Doctrine of the Mean is my own.</page><page sequence="10">112 Journal of the American Academy of Religion tum. Indeed, even while Tu Wei-ming characterizes the ideal of Confu- cian sagehood as a matter of experience, it is not a semantic slip when he still speaks habitually of "Neo-Confucian thought." The question still remains as to what exactly this model means experientially. It is one thing to talk abbut human beings obtaining and bringing to completion the heart-mind of heaven and earth or to make the claim that Confucian self- cultivation allows humankind to form a triad with heaven and earth, just as theologians can argue intellectually that faith brings one closer to God or that ethical conduct fulfills God's will on earth. It is quite another thing to give concrete illustration of such experience. Just as it is not intuitively obvious how the aspiring sage makes the leap from particular to univer- sal, froni principle as manifest to principle in its oneness, it is likewise not immediately evident how one identifies one's heart-mind with the heart- mind of heaven and earth and fulfills the cosmic and ethical obligations. In terms of the claim that some type of mysticism is being developed here, there is still a missing link. KNOWING THE SAGES AS THEY KNOW THEMSELVES: A "ROMANTIC" HERMENEUTIC There are, of course, many available avenues through which to explore the experiential dimensions of Chu Hsi's Neo-Confucianism, but there is one that follows especially well after the preceding discussion of the heart-mind of heaven and earth, even if the connection is not immedi- ately apparent. For reasons that will be made clear shortly, the remainder of this essay will focus on the two chapters from Conversations of Master Chu, Arranged Topically that are devoted to methods for reading classical texts (tu-shu-fa), the linchpin of Confucian learning," whereby Chu Hsi establishes specific curricular guidelines and puts forth an intriguing clus- ter of hermeneutic theories.12 A particularly subtle (and initially surpris- ing) point of departure is Chu Hsi's actual understanding of textual "meaning"-that is, exactly what it is that the reader is supposed to learn from the document being read--and this produces some significant rami- fications. At the outset of the first of the two chapters on classical herme- neutics, Chu Hsi appears to express two very different positions on this issue. In one instance he states that "in book learning we must simply " Although the primacy of classical learning in Confucianism is generally taken for granted, Wm. Theodore de Bary points out that the establishment of this owes more to Chu Hsi than is ordi- narily noted (188). 12 The conversation on Confucian hermeneutics has begun in earnest only during the last five years, having a discernable birth at a major conference convened at Rutgers University in late 1996 and chronicled in Ch'ing-I Tu. See also Chow, Ng, and Henderson.</page><page sequence="11">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 113 apprehend the many manifestations of moral principle" in order to rec- ognize that "all of them were complete in us from the very beginning, not added to us from the outside" (1990: 128).13 This position is precisely what one would expect from Chu Hsi, that classical study is a particularly use- ful heuristic device-an "investigation of things" par excellence-and that it would naturally provide an occasion for the astute reader to generalize. On the surface, this seems to recapitulate the previously discussed dia- lectic of principle and manifestation. Here, "meaning" is seen as empiri- cally accessible, though ethically and cosmically grounded; the text rep- resents or evokes matters that are particular and wholly discernible but which somehow replicate or participate in the single truth that is simul- taneously moral and metaphysical. And, of course, this principle is the same one that is already imprinted on the reader's inborn nature. I would suggest that this understanding of textual meaning can be characterized as an essentialist hermeneutic, which posits a single universal truth that underlies and can be extrapolated from the text and perhaps each indi- vidual portion of it. But again, it is not clear from this model of meaning alone exactly how or why one ascertains this truth from textual study. However, Chu Hsi suggests a second aspect of textual meaning that is equally crucial to his hermeneutic chapters, and it is here where the plot begins to thicken: "Read books to observe the intentions of the sages and worthies" (1990: 129). Here the reader is exhorted to understand not an independently existing universal principle but the original intentions of the author or authors: "It's best to take up the books of the sages and read them so that you understand their ideas" (1990: 129). In other words, textual meaning lies in the reconstruction of the intentions (and, by extension, whatever thoughts, insights, feelings, or experiences informed those in- tentions) of those who first created the work. It is important to note that this historical reconstructionist model of meaning that places primacy on authorial intent appears to mark a significant departure from the previ- ously stated essentialist interpretive paradigm.'4 This second approach could be most accurately understood as a romantic hermeneutic, one that anticipates Friedrich Schleiermacher and Wilhelm Dilthey's nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Verstehen school, the basic assumption of 13 Daniel Gardner translates tao-li as "moral principle," though a more literal rendering might be "principle of the way." The remainder of the passages from the tu-shu-fa chapters are taken from Gardner's translation. 14 For many readers today, it seems self-evident that the "meaning" of any text is the original position of its author. This theory of interpretation, what in philosophical circles is usually called "intentional originalism," is certainly the dominant position in mainstream Sinology and the his- tory of religions today. However, the existence of contending literary schools, not to mention the advent of postmodernism, serves as a reminder that the issue is far from resolved.</page><page sequence="12">114 Journal of the American Academy of Religion which is that the primary purpose of textual analysis is "to understand the discourse as a presentation of thought" (Schleiermacher: 161) and "to grasp the thinking that underlies a given statement" (Schleiermacher: 97). In simple (and intentionally tautological) language, for both Chu Hsi and his kindred Verstehen spirits, it is the author's voice that is the authorita- tive one.'5 Of course, reading to apprehend principle and reading to reconstruct the sages' intent appear to point toward different hermeneutic ends, though the equating of them is hardly a controversial claim in Neo- Confucian circles, and Chu Hsi quickly, if imprecisely, moves to smooth over this incongruity. "Follow the intentions of the sages and worthies to observe natural principle" (1990: 129), Chu Hsi asserts, as though such a connection were wholly self-evident. He does not make clear in the tu- shu-fa chapters if understanding principle follows naturally from the ac- quisition of some independent wellspring of sagely knowledge, if the sages have somehow intentionally transmitted the specific character of principle in both its singularity and its manifestations, or if there is any other his- torical or metaphysical link between the two hermeneutic models. This connection, however, does begin to take shape when Chu Hsi's outside references to the heart-mind of heaven and earth are filtered back into the discussion: "The heart-mind of the ten thousand things is like the heart-mind of heaven and earth. The heart-mind of all under heaven is like the heart-mind of the sages. With heaven and earth's giving life to the ten thousand things, there is a heart-mind of heaven and earth in each thing. With the sages in the world, every person has a heart-mind of the sages." 16 One implication here is that there is an intermediate conduit between the heart-mind of heaven and earth and the heart-mind of each person or thing. That is to say, the heart-mind of the sage is, not surprisingly, identifiable with (and ontologically indistinct from) both the heart-mind of heaven and earth and the heart-mind of the ordinary person. When this is brought to bear on the discussions of classical learning, Chu Hsi's two hermeneutic models converge. The romantic, reconstructionist model of meaning asserts that classical study allows one to know the heart-mind of the sage; this, in turn, allows one to know the heart-mind of heaven 15 This hermeneutic point is further driven home by E. D. Hirsch Jr., who writes, "Meaning is that which is represented by a text; it is what the author meant by his use of a particular sign se- quence; it is what the signs represent .... Authors, who like everyone else change their attitudes, feelings, opinions, and value criteria in the course of time, will obviously in the course of time tend to view their own work in different contexts. Clearly what changes for them is not the meaning of the work, but rather their relationship to that meaning" (8). 16 Translation adapted from Tillman 1992: 79.</page><page sequence="13">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 115 and earth, which ultimately allows one to know principle, which thus corroborates the essentialist model of meaning. Interestingly, this still reinforces the thoroughly Confucian idea that classical learning is a fun- damentally human science and enterprise; the characteristic of the clas- sics that allows the reader to learn principle is that they provide access to "the meaning of the ancients" (1990: 132), the sages, the human authors of the texts. As Chu Hsi's theories of this learning process unfold, what starts to emerge is that the process of "knowing" the heart-mind of the sages and the heart-mind of heaven and earth entails a distinctive experi- ential dimension, one that relates back to the issue of mysticism. It is here where the theoretical tools of Schleiermacher and Dilthey's Verstehen hermeneutics prove especially helpful in rendering Chu Hsi's work more intelligible and vivid. Chu Hsi regards reading a classical text as a particularly complex and subtle aesthetic challenge, and he alternately compares it with eating a piece of fruit (1990: 134), performing farmwork, viewing a house (1990: 141), shooting a bow (1990: 133), and drinking wine (1990: 141), which suggests the various needs for subtlety, stamina, thoroughness, precision, and attention to detail. The more traditional aspects of Chu Hsi's curricu- lum approximate what Schleiermacher labels "grammatical interpretation," the rigorous analysis of a text "on the basis of the use of language common to the author and his original public" (1990: 117). For Chu Hsi, this involves not only the methodical and painstaking process of reading and rereading "each and every paragraph, each and every sentence, each and every word" (1990: 129) but also the contextualization of the primary source-"we must look at the meaning of the surrounding text" (1990: 158)-and the compi- lation of relevant data from a broad range of secondary sources-"we must consult the various annotations, commentaries, and explanations so that our understanding is complete" (1990: 129). In a sense, this is recognizable as what today would be called "scholarship," the application of historical and philological analysis to produce a critical distillation of meaning within the document's original cultural and literary contexts. However, Chu Hsi directs most of his attention toward another more intriguing level of interpretation, one that he believes is too frequently omitted in the ordinary reading of canonical documents: "When men read a text, they merely read one layer; they don't try to get at the second layer" (1990: 129). Chu Hsi repeatedly stresses that one must move from lesser learning (hsiao-hsiieh) to greater learning (ta-hsiUeh), from "understand- ing of such-and-such an affair" to "investigation of such-and-such a prin- ciple" (1990: 90), and the ascension to a higher textual interpretation parallels this evolution. The specific instructions for accomplishing this are relatively straightforward, though at first glance they provide little clue</page><page sequence="14">116 Journal of the American Academy of Religion as to how the second threshold is achieved, how one can "look for an opening in the text" (1990: 130). Students are exhorted to limit the size of their cur- riculum (1990: 132), to read only one text at a time, and to read each text slowly and only in the order it is presented (1990: 133). In addition, proper reading is to be performed by oral recitation, followed by a period of quiet reflection, followed by yet another oral recitation (1990: 139). But a more careful examination reveals that these techniques do share a single heuris- tic quality; each serves somehow to bring the reader closer to the words of the sages, to move the reader beyond accumulated data and connect him or her more immediately to the sages themselves. A reduced curriculum allows one to "read little but become intimatelyfamiliarwith what you read" (1990: 131), for "only if you read just one paragraph per day will the text begin to become part ofyou" (1990: 133). Chu Hsi is admittedly uncertain about "how the [heart-]mind so naturally becomes harmonious with the psychophysical stuff, feels uplifted and energized, and remembers securely what it reads," though he is nevertheless confident that "if we recite it then think it over, think it over then recite it, naturally it'll become meaningful to us" (1990: 138). Over and over, Chu Hsi returns to the theme of "intimately familiar study" (shu-tu), the idea that one thoroughly knows the text not through consuming or routinizing the words but through entering into some kind of personal relation with them. This level of understanding does not necessarily yield new information per se, for it is a type of knowing that cannot be easily reduced to concepts or propositional facts. Rather, it is an intuitive knowledge, a sense of attunement that follows when one is patient and diligent enough to "take the words of the sages and worthies and pass them before your eyes, roll them around and around in your mouth, and turn them over and over in your [heart-]mind" (1990: 129). Once again, the Verstehen discourse seems particularly resonant here, as both Schleiermacher and Chu Hsi argue that an analytical approach to the text must be complemented by (and is ulti- mately not really separable from) an intuitive one. It may be recalled that Schleiermacher identifies the counterpart to "grammatical interpretation" as "technical interpretation" or "psychological interpretation," which "at- tempts to identify what has moved the author to communicate" (147). This aspect of apprehending meaning, Schleiermacher argues, is less a process of rigorous scholarship than one of "thought transfer" or "divination," whereby the reader seeks an immediate, phenomenological understanding of the person behind the text: "In interpretation it is essential that one be able to step out of one's own frame of mind into that of the author" (42). Furthermore, the synthesis of the grammatical and technical interpretation, the "historical and divinatory, objective and subjective reconstruction of a given statement" (Schleiermacher: 111), results in a unique type of intimate</page><page sequence="15">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 117 familiarity. In one telling (and frequently quoted) instance, Schleiermacher speaks of "understanding an author better than he understands himself' (64); in another, he formulates the task as "understand[ing] the text at first as well as and then even better than its author" (112). Similarly, Chu Hsi states that reading the classics is "like speaking with [the sages] face to face" (1990: 129), that "intimate familiarity naturally will lead to complete mas- tery" (1990: 134) as one can "wash away the old understanding and bring forth new ideas" (1990: 150) and see "the meaning leap right out from the text" (1990: 141). The goal of classical study is to know the text and the principle that informs it so well that "everything will naturally fall into place and interconnect" (1990: 100) or, in a manner of speaking, to know the sages as well as they knew themselves. But this knowledge of the sages and their works does not end with even the aforementioned level of intimate familiarity, and it is this step that is especially critical. Chu Hsi speaks not of merely "knowing" the principle of the texts but of somehow appropriating it for oneself, of "turning over and over in our [heart-]minds what's already become clear to us" (1990: 133), of "personally experiencing it over and over again" (1990: 132) in order "to make the reading relevant to our selves" (1990: 147). As Joseph Adler keenly observes, it is "Chu Hsi's hermeneutical principle that meaning is part of a broader intentionality that also includes practice" (182). It is worth noting that Chu Hsi continually emphasizes the concrete, experiential, lived char- acter of this genre of self-cultivation. As one reads, it is essential for "both body and [heart-]mind to enter into the passage" (Chu Hsi 1990: 146), for "the principle you probe" to be "embodied in your person" (1990: 143). And as he repeats and develops this language throughout the chapters, Chu Hsi increasingly suggests that familiarity with the ways of the sages is itself a stepping stone toward a still more profound level of intimacy, that of iden- tification. Students, Chu Hsi summarizes, "should turn the moral principle with which they're already intimate over and over in their [heart-]minds, until it permeates their entire person" (1990: 146). Here a certain resonance becomes apparent not only between Chu Hsi and Schleiermacher but also between Chu Hsi and Dilthey. In his accep- tance and expansion of Schleiermacher's theories, Dilthey argues that knowledge of an author and his or her work is not merely a subject expli- cating an object but, rather, a structured empathy that produces some extraordinary possibilities: "On the basis of this empathy or transposi- tion [of the self into some given expression], there arises the highest form of understanding in which the totality of the mental life is active-re- creating or re-living" (226). In other words, the fullest knowledge of a work occurs when the reader not only understands the experiences and ideas that are expressed or represented in the text but also generates and brings</page><page sequence="16">118 Journal of the American Academy of Religion to completion those very same experiences and ideas for him- or herself. As summarized by David Linge, when "the self-transpositionr or imagina- tive projection of the knower into the horizon of his subject matter" is suc- cessful, "I in effect become the other person or a citizen of the past age" (544). This, I would argue, is precisely the level of understanding and the process by which it is attained that Chu Hsi describes in the tu-shu-fa chapters. When Chu Hsi speaks of turning reading into "an experience meaningful to the self' (1990: 148) or being intimately familiar with a text to the point that the words become one's own (1990: 155), he is not describing the mere appli- cation of an external principle to the exigencies of one's own circumstances. Rather, he is calling on the reader to activate a principle latent in his or her own nature and engender the text's embodied wisdom in the reader's own life: "Generally speaking, in reading, we must first become intimately fa- miliar with the text so that its words seem to come from own mouths. We should then continue to reflect on it so that its ideas seem to come from our own [heart-]minds" (1990: 135). Even with secondary sources, "stu- dents are to understand it all, as if they themselves had written it" (1990: 156). The implication is quite profound. One does not acquire this wisdom; one produces it. One does not accumulate data about the sage's life experi- ence; one creates it anew. The conventional theory ascribed to Chu Hsi is that one becomes a sage by understanding principle. In fact, it may not be overly whimsical to suggest that Chu Hsi holds the exact opposite position; one understands principle by becoming a sage, by making a direct personal identification with the authors of the classics. For all of his sophisticated metaphysics and demands for extensive cultural and literary education, Chu Hsi's program of learning is, once again, a fundamentally humanistic one." In addition, Chu Hsi seems to sense that his admission of a type of intuitive-psychological-divinatory level of interpretation does not easily lend itself to an "objective" standard, and thus it could conceivably open the floodgates to a wave of subjective or speculative misunderstanding. This may partially explain why he devotes considerable attention to cau- tioning against narcissistic or solipsistic misappropriations of the classics. On the one hand, the reader is charged to appropriate the heart-mind of 17 Interestingly, John Berthrong relates the Verstehen school to Chu Hsi's hermeneutics not through Schleiermacher and Dilthey but through Hans-Georg Gadamer's "philosophical hermeneutics." Though his focus is somewhat different than that of this essay, Berthrong does note the "obligation to attempt the hermeneutic transformation of the past into the living reality of present experience" (201). Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, like Martin Buber's "dialogical hermeneutics" (yet an- other heir to the Verstehen school), offers the breakthrough of granting equal respect for the integrity of text and reader and locating the gist of interpretation within the interactive "conversation" or "play" between the two, a process that both Gadamer and Buber liken to the "I-Thou relation" (Gadamer; Kepnes). A handful of recent studies applies Verstehen hermeneutics or outgrowths of it to various other Chinese texts. See, for example, Crandell 1983, Herman 1996, and LaFargue 1992.</page><page sequence="17">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 119 the sages as his or her own; on the other hand, he or she is cautioned not to project misreadings onto the text and misconstrue his or her own un- cultivated heart-mind as that of the sages. "In reading," Chu Hsi writes, "don't force your ideas on the text" (1990: 150). And similarly, "Students mustn't compromise the words of the sages with their own ideas" (1990: 150). But, nevertheless, it is an occupational hazard that there are those who do not approach the texts in an appropriate spirit of receptivity and simply produce egocentric and superficial readings: "Not understanding the words of the sages, they express their own common ideas and take them as those of the sages" (1990: 148). It is the responsibility of the reader, presumably under the guidance of seasoned teachers, to respect the presupposition that the authors of the classics possess a more developed sagely heart-mind than does the reader and to recognize this distinction as an occasion for self- examination and self-improvement: "When you begin reading, you become aware that you're unlike the sages and worthies-how can you not urge your- self on?" (1990: 129). Chu Hsi adds a similar quotation from the eleventh- century Su Hstin, "When I first saw the words and ideas of the ancients, I found them so different from mine. With time I read them in greater detail, and my [heart-]mind suddenly became dear" (1990: 146). As if to summarize the aggressive, self-revelatory nature of Chu Hsi's method of reading, Schleiermacher writes, "There is a more rigorous practice of the art of interpretation that is based on the assumption that misunderstand- ing occurs as a matter of course, and so understanding must be willed and sought at every point" (110). Chu Hsi is the first to recognize that this syn- thesis of the critical and the romantic is not a trivial task. In summary, Chu Hsi's concept of textual meaning in the case of the Confucian classics is simultaneously essentialist and romantic; the texts manifest and embody universal principle, but they also reflect the spe- cific intentions, ideas, and experiences of the sages, who are wholly his- torical human beings. To some extent, the locus of learning in Chu Hsi's program of education may be the historical sages even more than the prin- ciples illustrated in their texts.I" Chu Hsi implicitly justifies this conflation of principle and sagely intent through the identification of the heart-mind of heaven and earth with the heart-mind of the sage. The process of ap- prehending textual meaning-that is, of discerning universal principle and the ideas of the sages-entails a studious combination of rigorous schol- arship (on culture, language, history, ethics, etc.) and structured empa- thy for the historical authors. The key point is that this empathy does not end with a sympathetic appreciation of the sages but, rather, continues 18 Perhaps to the extent that it involves the process of classical study, the School of Principle (li-hsiieh) could be more correctly construed as the School of the Sage or the Sagely Study (sheng-jen-hsiieh).</page><page sequence="18">120 Journal of the American Academy of Religion on to the creative act of reliving and creating anew the spirit of sagehood, which thus facilitates the realization of one's own nature as the embodi- ment of principle and the engendering for oneself of the wisdom recorded in the texts. To put this in something of a schematic, the human heart- mind, through a romantic hermeneutic (which combines both scholarly and divinatory components) of the classical Confucian legacy, can become the sagely heart-mind, which is ultimately identical to the heart-mind of heaven and earth, a process that allows one to participate in the great trans- formations of yin and yang, to assist the nourishing and transforming powers of heaven and earth, and thereby to form a triad with heaven and earth. This, I suggest, is one aspect of Chu Hsi's project that is appropri- ately classified as mystical. Chu Hsi implicitly testifies to undergoing a specific aggregate of experiences that he exhorts the reader to duplicate. The experiences are understood as direct connections to and revitaliza- tions of the spiritual efficacy of the sages, through which one knows prin- ciple and shares in the spiritual efficacy of heaven and earth. CONCLUSION: NEO-CONFUCIAN MYSTICISM AND THE MODERN STUDY OF MYSTICISM Historically speaking, not all religious phenomena are experiential and not all religious experiences are mystical. Still, it is not really all that sur- prising to find a mystical component to Chu Hsi's Neo-Confucianism, if one is prepared to jettison the a priori assumption that mysticism is by necessity iconoclastic, otherworldly, or esoteric. Steven Katz notes re- peatedly that, more often than not, the foundations of mystical experi- ence are fundamentally conservative (1983a: 3-60), and buddhologist Robert Gimello adds that "mystical experience is simply the psychoso- matic enhancement of religious beliefs and values or of beliefs and values of other kinds that are held 'religiously"' (1982: 85). The use of the term psychosomatic is here intended clinically, referring not to something de- termined to be unreal or imaginary but to phenomena that are simulta- neously physiological and psychological, simultaneously somatic and psychic."9 Even Hans Penner's coinage, "mystical illusion," which is based on a presumed (and questionable) primacy of "religious systems," ad- 19 In defense of various attacks on this statement, Gimello responds, "This claim, which I still make, can be interpreted as a denigration of mysticism only by those who hold 'religious beliefs and values' in low esteem. The perennialists seem to do just that, and it is just this implication of their approach to which I most strenuously object-its overweening presumption in pretending to have rescued mysticism from 'mere' religion" (1990: 18).</page><page sequence="19">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 121 dresses not the legitimacy or validity of the experiences but the appropri- ateness of conflating varieties of cross-cultural phenomena into one self- sufficient category.20 Although Chu Hsi's mysticism is marked by some modicum of paradox (e.g., that heaven and earth possesses a heart-mind that is spiritually efficacious yet without cognition or volition) and resis- tance to purely analytical scrutiny (e.g., divinatory hermeneutics), it es- sentially reinforces and corroborates core Confucian values and philo- sophical positions. It is a mysticism that maintains the almost ontological status given to culture, that upholds the primacy of rootedness and social responsibility, and that values the sage as both an ethical vanguard and a conduit to heavenly mandate. Indeed, it is a mysticism that dovetails with and sheds light on the more rational and better known aspects of Chu Hsi's Neo-Confucianism. Of course, simply identifying a set of experiences as both mystical and Confucian is a precursor to the more challenging task of accurately char- acterizing the specific nuances of this particular Confucian mysticism. Now that some contextual groundwork has been done, it is immediately tempting, and not totally unwarranted, to try to plug Chu Hsi's mystical dimensions into established taxonomies of different forms of mysticism, to relate them critically to other historical occurrences of mystical expe- rience. Unfortunately, the scholarly development of such typologies has tended to reflect certain theological biases and emotional preferences. Ninian Smart (1978: 13-14) points out that one of the earliest typologi- cal schemes of mysticism was put forth by R. C. Zaehner, who distin- guished between theistic and monistic mysticism or, more accurately, between those he esteemed and those he did not, thus lumping together a number of thematically and historically unrelated types under the lat- ter heading. On the other hand, Smart's own differentiation between the mystical and the numinous replicates some of the same problems, though he is admittedly oversimplifying in the interest of providing a starting point for the conversation (1995: 59-76). Lee Yearley adopts a similar dichotomy, identifying the most common forms of mysticism as those of "union" and "unity," but he does so for the purpose of noting that they do not seem to apply to the mysticism found in the writings of Chuang Tzu, the fourth-century B.C.E. philosopher retrospectively categorized as 20 Penner writes, "The mystical illusion is the result of an abstraction which distorts the seman- tic or structural field of a religious system. As such it is a false category, unreal, regardless of whether it is taken as the universal essence of religion or as a particular feature of a religious system. The chimera is produced by focusing on certain elements of the system" (96).</page><page sequence="20">122 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Taoist.21 Instead, Yearley introduces the idea of "intraworldly mysticism,"22 which I have elsewhere argued resonates with what Maurice Friedman accurately calls Martin Buber's "mysticism of the particular and the con- crete" (Friedman: 415-416). The one wrinkle that makes characterizing Chu Hsi's mysticism so challenging is that the identification of the human heart-mind with the heart-mind of heaven and earth entails something of an intermediate step, that is, the simultaneously romantic and critical re-creation in oneself of the wisdom and life experience of the authors of the classics. For a respon- sible typology of this set of experiences, it is necessary to take into account both the ontology and the process (or discipline, as the case may be), to give due consideration to both the cosmic issue of participating in heaven and earth's nourishing and transforming powers and the worldly issue of developing direct insight into the heart-mind of the sages. Certainly, it is not sufficient in this case simply to quantify the metaphysics of the expe- rience. While it could be argued that the singularity of principle justifies the label of "monistic" or "unity," this is clearly not the monism of the Hindu atman-brahman identity, even as there may be some interesting resonances between the dualism of principle and psychophysical stuff and the dualism of spirit (purusa) and nature (prakrti). The main concern here is that such a classification does not capture the uniquely human and in- terpersonal quality of Confucian mystical experience. Indeed, Confucian- ism is often represented (or misrepresented) as purely social, ethical, or secular, and so it is quite appropriate that the locus of Confucian mysti- cal experience is human relationship, which is predicated on the cosmi- cally grounded interconnectedness of human beings.23 The important facet of this that is too often overlooked is that the significance of this 21 Yearley is especially articulate in his characterization of these two types of mysticism. Of mys- ticism of union, he writes, "The two key elements are an immutable transcendent reality and a contingent but real world. One reality gives itself its own eternal existence, and it must be-it is necessary. The other reality receives its existence from elsewhere, can change, and need not neces- sarily exist-it is contingent. In the mysticism of union these two separate realities meet but are preserved: a union but not a unity exists between the unchanging Real and the changing but still real particular individual" (130). Of mysticism of unity, he writes, "It rests on a monistic base; only one reality exists, and no particular is fully real. Anything that is, insofar as it is, is one; therefore any individual is a mere negative limitation on the universal. The union is as complete as that of salt and water or a drop of water and the ocean" (131). 22 Yearley characterizes intraworldly mysticism as "a complex mixture of attachment and detach- ment," a process whereby "a total involvement with each moment and enjoyment of it combine with a detachment from the moment once it passes and a lack of desire that it return" (135). 23 It should be noted that this argument does not open the floodgates to a claim that all romantic hermeneutics are mystical, even though they are not entirely analytical or rational. What distin- guishes Neo-Confucian romantic hermeneutics from other romantic hermeneutics is its essential- ist and cosmic quality, the identification of the authors' intentions with principle.</page><page sequence="21">Herman: Human Heart, Heavenly Heart 123 extends beyond the "merely" human, as the state of identification with and reanimation of the sages is tantamount to the state of identification with heaven and earth and participation in their processes. Tu Wei-ming is fond of refuting claims that Confucianism is anthro- pocentric by countering that it is actually "anthropocosmic" in nature, that the realization of humanity is laden with cosmic implications.24 And this, I would argue, provides an accurate and satisfying illumination of the types of experiences elucidated in this essay. The mystical dimensions of Chu Hsi's strain of Neo-Confucianism are indeed anthropocosmic, in that the process of experiential realization and the arena of expression are thoroughly human, while what is at stake is nothing less than the health and vitality of all of creation. The idea of an anthropocosmic mysticism may not ultimately prove to be the best or final conceptualization of Con- fucian mysticism, but it does capture the distinctiveness of Chu Hsi's mystical dimensions and provide a workable basis for future compara- tive study. In addition to the conceptual issues, there are certain historical ques- tions suggested by this study that can be broached here only briefly. Per- haps the most obvious one concerns the influences that informed Chu Hsi's innovations, as it may be worthwhile to investigate whether Chu Hsi was drawing his theory of empathy from his Confucian predecessors like Liu Hsieh and K'ung Ying-ta or simply responding to more immediate contextual pressures. Much has been written, with greater and lesser degrees of accuracy, about Neo-Confucianism accommodating and re- sponding to various Buddhist challenges, particularly in the area of meta- physics. But it may be more than a coincidence that Chu Hsi's desire for an intuitive, psychic link to the sages echoes the Ch'an doctrine of mind- to-mind transmission of the dharma. Chu Hsi begins the tu-shu-fa chap- ters by stating that "book learning is of secondary importance" (1990: 128), which certainly evokes Ch'an suspicions of textual authority. In a man- ner of speaking, Chu Hsi is also undermining textual authority, but only in favor of authorial authority, which in a sense replicates and reproduces 24 Tu writes, "The ideal of being able to assist in the transforming and nourishing process of heaven and earth does seem too lofty to be actualized in concrete human affairs. But whether the paradigm is fully realizable in the world, the ontological assertion that there is a possibility of hu- man participation in the cosmic creativity is itself of great significance. It implies that the meaning of what is normally believed to be a personal quest for self-realization can no longer be restricted to the psychosocial realm; moral self-cultivation necessarily assumes an 'anthropocosmic' dimen- sion" (1976: 119). Tu is not the only one to employ this term-it has been used to describe Vedic philosophy (Panikkar) and has even found its way into dramatic arts (Ntifiez)-but he is clearly the one most responsible for bringing it so prominently into the Confucian discourse.

This type of attitude is not a wholly unlikely adapta- tion for a tradition that insists on maintaining continuity with its cultural legacy but is under assault from an outside tradition that boasts of a di- rect teacher-to-student transmission of ultimate truth. In any event, this article is hardly the last word on the issue of Confucian mysticism, for Confucianism comprises much more than the Neo-Confucian revival, Chu Hsi is by no means the only or most obvious Neo-Confucian to ex- amine in this capacity, and this study of the heart-mind of heaven and earth and romantic hermeneutics is certainly not the only conceivable approach to Chu Hsi's teachings. What is important is that once we fully discard the dated misconception that any Chinese mysticism must be the exclusive domain of Taoism and Buddhism, we may begin to open up a whole range of inquiry on the subject of Confucian mysticism.
