<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Common Classical Sources of Buddhist and Christian Narrative Art By H. BUCHTHAL (PLATES V-XIV) (The Summary of a Lecture given on 11th February, 1943, under the joint auspices of the Royal Asiatic and India Societies) FTlHE Greco-Buddhist sculpture of Gandhara has for a long time -1- been of singular attraction for students of Indian art. These sculptures of greyish-blue schist found in such quantities in the inaccessible valleys of the Indo-Afghan frontier, have from the outset been noted for their classical affinities, and many were brought to Europe by art-loving dilettanti. The particular qualities distinguishing them from all other Indian sculpture were duly extolled; they came to be recognized as the earliest examples of new ideas which changed the whole development of Indian art and propagated Western influence throughout the Buddhist world. But the role so enthusiastically assigned to them has not remained unchallenged. A younger generation, more eager to discover the truly national qualities of the arts of Asia, maintained that the only reason for this admiration was that on account of their Greek affinities the Gandhara sculptures were less strange to Europeans than Asiatic art proper. They considered Greco-Buddhist sculpture a weak and provincial offshoot of Western art, without much influence in the East, and for the most part of a quality which could not compete with the broad current of the Indian tradition. Even those iconographical innovations with which the sculptors of Gandhara had generally been credited, such as the creation of the Buddha image, were attributed by these scholars to other and more " national " schools. To this day no satisfactory solution of the problem has come forward. The frieze of the Great Renunciation from the eastern gate of the Great Stupa at Sanchi (PI. V) is a typical example of Buddhist iconography in its early stages.1 The Buddha, accom panied by his faithful servant, leaves his father's palace. His horse is carried in solemn procession by a number of gods who help the 1 Cf. Gruenwedel-Waldschmidt, Buddhistische Kunst in Indien, Berlin, 1932, p. 68, fig. 77 ; Sir John Marshall and A. Foncher, The Monuments of Sanchi, Calcutta, 1940, p. 203, pi. 40.</page><page sequence="2">138 BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN NARRATIVE ART prince to pass unnoticed through the strongly guarded city gate. The architecture of the city, the dress and attributes of the human figures are accurately described. The horse is shown five times in the different stages of the journey, which serves to emphasize the continuity of the action and to render the narrative vivid and impressive. But the presence of the Buddha is indicated by the traditional symbols only: the royal umbrella above the horse while he is on horseback, the footsteps when he has dismounted. A sculpture in the Calcutta Museum shows the same subject represented by Gandhara artists1 (PL VI). One scene has replaced the sequence of episodes at Sanchi. The impression of universal movement and continuity has disappeared; the single human figure has assumed a prominence unknown in the earlier cycle. We are presented with a "dry statement of facts. The Buddha himself is shown riding on his horse, his right hand raised; the servant holds the royal umbrella behind him with a protective gesture. Yet most of the elements of the early Buddhist version are still present: in accordance with the literary tradition, the horse is carried by deities who support his hoofs in order to avoid noise, and a host of smaller gods and devas accom pany the Buddha on his mission. Students of Early Christian art will recognize the similarity between this scene and Christ's Entry into Jerusalem, as represented on Roman sarcophagi of the fourth century 2 (PL VII, fig. 1). All the main elements of the Buddhist work recur in the Christian composition: Christ is mounted, raising his right hand; the bearded apostle behind him lifts his arm with a protective gesture. Zachaeus takes the place of the figure above the Buddha's servant. The deities carrying the horse's front hoofs should be compared with the children spreading their clothes in the way. The Buddhist sculpture and the Christian sarcophagus cannot be directly dependent on each other. If related in any way they must derive from a common model, a Western work of the first centuries of our era. The group which forms the chief subject of both sculptures occurs indeed on Roman Imperial coins of the second and third centuries (PL VII, fig. 2). The type is used for the adventus of the emperor, i.e. his triumphal entry into a town, 1 W. Cohn, Indische Plastik, Berlin, 1921, fig. 1 ; N. G.

Morey, Early Christian Art, Princeton, 1942, fig. 139.</page><page sequence="3">BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN NARRATIVE ART 139 and for the profectio, i.e. his triumphal departure.1 He is shown on horseback ; on the adventus coin he raises his right hand; on the profectio coin the figure in front of the horse turns towards the rider; and the pedisequus behind raises his standard with a protective gesture. It is evident that this type has been used for both the Christian and the Buddhist triumphal scenes. Only a minimum of changes was necessary to adapt it to the Buddhist and Christian requirements. It is interesting to observe how in the Buddhist sculpture the Roman elements are combined with those retained from the early iconography of the subject. In India the iconographical type of the Great Renunciation, as evolved for the first time in the art of Gandhara, soon became universal. The school of Amaravati, for instance, now produced a work which, though in a completely different artistic tradition, is in all its material details a faithful repetition of the Gandharan formula.2 This break with the traditional repertoire has been effected under the influence of Roman Imperial art. I have shown elsewhere 3 that the creation of the Buddha image stands at the beginning of this development, and was the earliest sign of Roman influence in India. Peaceful contact between Rome and the East was one of the foremost aims of Imperial trade policy. From the middle of the first century a.d. political conditions favoured the use of the overland route from the eastern Mediterranean via Palmyra, which was the shortest connection between Rome and India 4; and as this route gained in importance the people in the Indus countries became acquainted with the products of Roman art. The cult image of the standing Buddha was created after the pattern of an early Imperial toga statue ; that of its sitting counterpart followed soon afterwards. Both cult images originated shortly before the reign of Kanishka (second quarter of the second century a.d.), who reproduced them on his coins. All subsequent development of the school is based on this 1 Cf. Stevenson-Smith-Madden, Dictionary of Roman Coins, 1889, s.v. Adventus and Profectio Augusti; on the history of the type, cf. D. E. L. Haynes, Mors in Victoria, in Papers of the British School at Rome, 15, 1939, pp. 27 ff., pis. 1, 2. 2 Cf. W. Cohn, op. cit., pi. 17 ; L.

It was the decisive factor in the formation of narrative religious art in Buddhist countries, and led to the emergence of an epic cycle, modelled on Western lines, depicting the outstanding events of the Buddha's life. The origin of these cycles was similar to that of the earliest cycles of the life of Christ. A large number of scenes had to be illustrated which, because of the absence of the Buddha image in earlier days, had hitherto been represented in a very different way, or had never been illustrated at all. When the young Christian community was faced with a similar task, they adopted traditional types in current use with the people among whom they lived.1 Figural types, groups, and compositions taken from Greek and Roman mythology, and other classical subjects were transformed into Christian scenes and given a new religious meaning ; and as the worship and symbolism formerly connected with the emperor were now transferred to Christ, scenes of Imperial triumph found a prominent place in Christian iconography.2 Nor was there a sudden and definite break in the stylistic field. The forms of expression and the technique of the earliest Christian monuments are those normally used by local artists throughout the Roman Empire. Only at a much later date, when Christianity had been firmly established in the Western world, there emerged an art of specifically Christian character.3 A similar development can be traced in the narrative Buddhist cycles. Just as the entry of Christ into Jerusalem shows the Roman triumphal scene transformed into a Christian subject, the repre sentation of the Great Renunciation shows its adaptation by Buddhism. Still more characteristic examples for this Roman infiltration into the north-west border-country can be found among subjects which had hitherto not been represented in Buddhist art, especially certain scenes in which the presence of the Buddha in human form was indispensable. It is significant that in Gandhara these scenes became all the more popular. Pis. VIII, fig. 1, and IX, fig. 1, show an identical pictorial type used for two different subjects. One is a Jataka illustration, in which the Buddha is not the historical Gautama, but Dipankara, the earliest of his twenty-four predecessors; the other illustrates an 1 E.

In both sculptures the central group is practically the same : the standing Buddha and the prostrate figure in front of him. Neither of these scenes occurs in earlier Buddhist art. This makes it all the more probable that the group was introduced from outside, and in both cases adapted to the particular requirements of the story. The closest parallel can be found in Early Christian book-illustration. It occurs, for instance, in the Codex Rossanensis, a Greek Gospel of the sixth century, in a miniature representing the raising of Lazarus; the dead man's two sisters lie prostrate on the ground before the Saviour* (PI. VIII, fig. 2). Again, there can be no ques tion of direct copying one way or another. It is to a classical formula that both the Buddhist and Christian works should be traced back. It is true that the Proskynesis, i.e. the prostration before a god or a hero, was a custom unknown to classical antiquity, and is not found on Imperial monuments until it was introduced into the Mediterranean world from the East during the later centuries of the Empire.2 But the prostrate figure does occur in Roman triumphal art. The vanquished enemy lies in the dust before the victor. A representation of this scene occurs on a frieze dating from the time of Trajan, i.e. the early second century a.d., and showing a victory of the Romans over the Daces3 (PL XIV). The barbarian under the emperor's horse lies on the ground in exactly the same position as the women in the Christian miniature, and the student and the ascetic in the Buddhist sculptures. Again a figure type taken from the repertory of Roman Imperial art has been adopted by both Buddhist and Christian artists for representing religious subjects in which the hero takes the place of the Roman emperor. One more point of similarity with Christian monuments is worth noting. Although it appears only once, the Buddha figure in the Conversion of Angulimalya actually belongs to two distinct scenes : the attack of the murderer and his subsequent humiliation. The same scheme occurs in East Christian miniatures, for instance, in the Rotulus of Joshua, a tenth-century copy of an original five 1 Cf. H. Peirce and R. Tyler, UArt byzantin, ii, 1934, pi. 148, 149. 2 Cf. A. Alfoeldi, " Die Ausgestaltung des monarchischen Zeremoniells am roemischen Kaiserhofe," in Roem. Mitteilungen, 49, 1934, pp. 46 ff. * This frieze makes now part of the decoration of the Arch of Constantino. Cf. H. P. L'Orange and A. v. Gerkan, Der spaetantike Bildschmuck des Konstantins bogens, Berlin, 1939, pi. 49.</page><page sequence="6">142 BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN NARRATIVE ART or more centuries older. Joshua, the hero of the story, meets the Angel of the Lord: first he challenges him, then, recognizing his heavenly nature, he falls to the ground in adorationx (PL IX, fig. 2). The Angel, who is represented only once, in fact participates in both scenes which show a single continuity of action in two successive phases. Both the Christian and the Buddhist works are striking examples of the survival and identical use of the continuous method of representation?an innovation evolved in Roman Imperial art and best studied on monuments like Trajan's Column and Roman mythological sarcophagi.2 PL X, figs. 1 and 2, show another impressive example of the parallel development of Christian and Gandharan iconography. The Gandhara sculpture represents three scenes from the life of the Buddha ; the Christian ivory diptych, a work of the fifth century, shows in a similar arrangement three New Testament scenes.3 The style of the Indian work is so much more lively and illusionistic that it seems to derive directly from a classical model of the first centuries; the Christian artists of the fifth, however, presumably had some intermediate stage before them. Continuous copying of the prototype must have resulted in a hardening and stiffening of the figures, and much of the illusionistic modelling must have been lost in the process. The common pagan prototype, how ever, is still easily recognizable in both monuments. What this common prototype was, and to which mythological group it belonged, I cannot tell. It is just possible that it was part of the liturgical cycle of one of the mystery religions which were so powerful during the last centuries of the classical world and must have formed an important link between late antique and Early Christian pictorial art. The general arrangement, in any case, is common in the art of the Roman Empire, and especially in the provinces. The arrangement of square fields, one above the other, each containing one or two single figures, for instance, occurs frequently on monuments found in Gaul 4 (PL XI, figs. 1 and 2). In Gandhara, we can observe this motive gradually growing more Indian and assuming a shape and rhythm more and more removed 1 Cf. Morey, op. cit., fig. 58. 2 F. Wickhoff, Roemische Kunst, Berlin, 1912, pp. 123 ff.; cf. also H. Koch Roemische Kunst, Breslau, 1925, p. 71 f. 3 Cf. M. H. Longhurst, Catalogue of Carvings in Ivory (in the Victoria and Albert Museum), Part i, London, 1927, pi. 8. 4 Cf.

Finally, it is used as a decorative frame for works which consist of one or several reliefs with scenes from the Buddha's life, one on top of the other, in the form of a flat stele.1 A similar complicated scheme is found all over the Roman Empire from the first century a.d. onwards in monuments of the Mithraic cult. In the centre there is Mithra killing the bull, a scene which should be taken both as an epic narrative and as a representative cult-image.2 Around this image there are small scenes from the god's life?a veritable vita of the god, comprising the whole credo of the Mithraic religion. These reliefs seem to reflect compositions of the type of the Tabula Iliaca, which show the Iliupersis in the centre and a number of smaller single scenes grouped around it. The Tabula Iliaca was probably the archetype of all such group com positions, which in course of time was adjusted to fit a number of other subjects.3 The original composition has been attributed to Asia Minor, and this makes the connection between the Gandhara sculptures and the classical monuments even more probable. Another decorative pattern common in the art of Gandhara is the frieze consisting of rows of single figures, or sometimes of simple ornamental motives, each under a pointed Indian arch (PI. XII). In most instances the arches, with bunches of grapes hanging down on both sides, are suspended in mid-air; but occasionally they rise straight from the ground. The balls on which they sometimes rest can reasonably be taken as substitutes for the grapes which had originally a definite symbolical meaning. The figures and arches are separated from each other by the characteristic Indo-Corinthian columns surmounted by Persepolitan capitals. This kind of frieze is typical of the later stages of the Gandhara school. Generally it shows merely the unaccentuated repetition of the same figures, but sometimes they form a symmetrical pattern, for instance when approaching a central Buddha image from both sides. The decorative system of these friezes seems to derive from an earlier type of frieze frequent in Gandhara. The general arrange ment is very similar, though the proportions and the rhythm are different. The motive of two persons in discussion, for instance, is repeated several times, each couple under the pointed arch, and 1 Cf. A. Foucher, VArt Grdco-bouddhique du Gandhara, i, 1905, fig. 225. 2 F. Saxl, Mithras, Berlin, 1931, fig. 83. 3 Saxl, op. cit., pp. 37 ff.</page><page sequence="8">144 BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN NARRATIVE ART separated by the usual column (PL XIII, fig. 1). But the arches neither stop in mid-air nor do they rest on the ground, as in the later examples. They are supported by structures faintly recalling carved classical columns. The sculptural background might well stand for an apsidal niche. The later friezes which we have already discussed were developed out of this scheme : first the structural function of the columns supporting the arches was gradually obliterated ; then the columns were omitted. Ultimately the arch, more pointed in shape and more Indian in feeling, rises straight from the ground. This earlier type of frieze is indeed derived from Roman sarcophagi. It is true that certain single features connect these works with the native Indian tradition, for instance, the pointed arches which repeat the form used in the fafades of Buddhist rock cut temples and caves. For its general arrangement, however, our frieze should be compared with pagan and Early Christian sarcophagi (PL XIII, figs. 2 and 3). A sarcophagus of the Muses,1 for instance, which belongs to the Asiatic type usually called Sidamara, is clearly of the kind from which both the Christian 2 and the Buddhist works are derived. The pair of Muses on the left resemble in every gesture and movement the first couple on the Indian frieze. The carved columns of the Sidamara and the Christian examples are reflected in the ornament which appears in the same place in the Buddhist frieze ; the Gandhara arches repeat the pattern seen on the pagan sarcophagus. The Christian monument even has the apsidal niches which we recognized in the Indian work. The grapes, here lacking on the pagan sarcophagus, are certainly a classical heritage ; they occur frequently on sarcophagi and related monuments of Dionysiac origin.3 The main difference is the intro duction of the Indo-Corinthian columns. This results in a slightly different spacing and prevents that impression of overcrowding so characteristic of the group of Asiatic sarcophagi. Our method throughout this article has been purely archaeological. We have found some of the models of Gandhara art in Imperial Roman triumphal and funerary sculpture. The adaptation of the Roman types was the one contribution of the North-West to the 1 Sardis, vol. 5, part 1 ; Ch. R. Morey, The Sarcophagus of Claudia Antonia Sabina and the Asiatic Sarcophagi, Princeton, 1924, fig. 90. 2 Peirce and Tyler, VArt Byzantin, i, 1932, pi. 94 a. 3 G.

Olsen, Dionysiac Sarcophagi in Baltimore, 1942, p. 47.</page><page sequence="9">BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN NARRATIVE ART 145 art of India, and in fact to universal Buddhism. The eager acceptance of the Buddha image by the whole Buddhist world is a convincing proof of this. But as these monuments are primarily of a religious nature, it is obviously necessary to link up the results we have obtained with the history of the Buddhist religion. We have seen that the creation of the Buddha image was the earliest achievement of the Gandhara school. It is hard to believe that so revolutionary an act as the first anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha should not have had its counterpart in the development of Buddhist thought. But this is not yet the time for a definite answer to this question. So far the texts preserved do not seem to point to an intimate con nection between the innovations introduced by the Gandhara school and the evolution of Buddhist thought. The beginnings of the Gandhara school seem to be contemporary with the rise of the Mahayana, the new doctrine of salvation which, during the first centuries of our era, profoundly transformed the original ideas evolved by the early Buddhist schools. Direct evidence is still lacking, and the single stages of the early history of the Mahayana in its relation to the Hinayana are unknown to us. But in all probability the creation of the Buddha image is connected with a new conception of the divinity of the Blessed One as propagated by the Mahayanists. The development of Christian art offers a close parallel. Here we are much better informed about the controversies which centred on the problem of whether Christ should be represented in person or not. The works of the early Fathers of the Church reflect in detail the theological background of the problem and the fierce discussions which took place before the human portrait of Christ became finally victorious over the symbolical representations of the Christian doctrine of salvation.1 No doubt the Buddha image owes its origin to a similar development of religious ideas, and to a similar controversy on the divine nature of the historical Buddha ; and it is to be hoped that one day we shall be able to trace this development in the literary sources of the period. It remains to be explained why this decisive step was taken in Gandhara, in the extreme north-west of the country, in a province 1 Cf. W. Elliger, Die Stellung der alien Christen zu den Bildern in den ersten vier Jahrhunderten, nach den Angaben der zeitgenossischen kircfdichen Schriftsteller, Leipzig, 1930.</page><page sequence="10">146 BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN NARRATIVE ART which had played no conspicuous part in the earlier development of Indian art. The answer might perhaps be that Gandhara, by virtue of its geographical situation, was eminently qualified to play a double role in the history of Buddhism.1 On the one hand, it was one of the most important provinces of the Kushan Empire which at that time extended over almost the whole of northern India; and the monks in its many monasteries had a large share in the formation of the Mahayana school of thought. It is perhaps significant that Asvagosha, the learned author of the Buddhakaritha, one of the oldest Books of the Mahayana,2 is said to have been the spiritual adviser of the great Kanishka, who made Peshawar his winter capital, and was the first king to show the Buddha image on his coins. On the other hand, Gandhara had for centuries been the region of India most open to Western influences. In a way, it was the easternmost outpost of the Mediterranean world ; and when at last Indian artists took the decisive step of representing the Buddha in human shape, a Mediterranean type eminently suitable was available in Gandhara but not in other parts of India. Another point which might be explained through a study of the religious history of the period is the parallel development of the cycles depicting the lives of Christ and of the Buddha. We have seen that both were based on iconographic formulae evolved in Roman historical sculpture. The identical way of interpretation and adaptation of pagan prototypes for similar subjects in Buddhist and Christian art seems to suggest that certain Christian and Mahayanist ideas must have developed on similar lines. Though the Mahayana contains hardly anything of which traces cannot be discovered in some form or other in most earlier Buddhist writings known to us, it was not before the rise of this school that the Buddha became primarily a figure of pity and compassion, a hero of charity offering salvation to mankind. And it might well be this common conception of universal salvation which is ultimately responsible for the similarities in the narrative. On several instances we even meet exactly the same story in the Buddhist and Christian traditions, and it is clear that they have a very similar significance. Peter 1 Cf. A. Foucher in Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, vol. 6, s.v. Gandhara. 2 Trans, by F. Max Mueller in vol. 49 of the Sacred Books of the East, Oxford, 1894.</page><page sequence="11">BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN NARRATIVE ART 147 walking on the sea is paralleled by the story of the disciple who wanted to cross a large river to join the Buddha who was preaching on the other side.1 He could not find a boat, but his longing to listen to the sermon was such that he started to cross the river on foot. He walked as on solid ground, but when he reached the middle of the river and saw enormous waves his enthusiasm began to wane, and his feet to sink. But his desire to be near the Buddha surged up again, and finally he was able to achieve his journey safely. The meaning of the story, of course, is the same as in the Gospel of Matthew. The faith in the Buddha and his excellence creates solid ground and is a promise of ultimate salvation for the believer even in the midst of the most deadly danger. There is a number of other scenes,2 such as the Temptation, the Feeding of the Five Thousand, and the Widow's Mite,3 which recur in a similar form in the Buddhist tradition. The exact age of these texts has never been definitely established. But it was Mahayana theology which handed them down to us and underlined the parabolic meaning that corresponds to their Christian parallels. Thus the illustrations of these stories reflect the significance they had assumed in the Mahayana system. The narrative tradition adopted was that established in Imperial Roman times. With the development of religious ideas in late antiquity, this purely narrative style was used for scenes and cycles of symbolical content even in the art of Rome ; and it reappears in the monuments of the various religious communities throughout the Roman world which took it over for representing the symbolism of their own doctrines of salvation. Not only the Mithraic cult but also Early Christian and Buddhist artists related the lives of their redeemers in the antique tradition. It is the classical heritage which we have traced in the Gandharan and Christian religious cycles. We have seen how narrative religious art was created through the adaptation of foreign types and formulae, and how religious ideas new to the history of Buddhism were for the first time given artistic expression. But the under lying currents of Indian thought could only be intimated. It remains 1 Cf. " Buddha und Jesus in ihren Paralleltexten," zusammengestellt von J. B.
