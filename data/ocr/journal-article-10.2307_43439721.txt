Observations Corroborate Savanna Community Concept Andre F. Clewell, A. F. Clewell, Inc., 1447 Tallevast Road, Sarasota, FL 34243; 813-355-5065. A recent issue of R&amp;MN (6(1)13) included an article by Steve Packard, espousing the existence of a distinctive savanna community in Illinois. These savannas occupied terrain separating tallgrass prairie from eastern deciduous forest. Packard ex- plained that the few extant stands of this open wood- land had been severely altered by anthropomorphic activities. Although ecologists generally consider these savannas merely as ecotones or segments along a continuum, Packard argued that the Illinois savannas contained a distinct floristic element that was lacking from neighboring prairies and deciduous forests. This floristic discontinuity war- ranted the recognition of the savannas as comprising a separate plant community. His contention was supported by field notes of pioneer naturalist Dr. S. B. Mead and also by the performance of the sup- posed savanna species when brought together in a restored community. I am inclined to accept Packard's thesis because of my own familiarity with related vegetation. Packard singled out a legume, Lespedeza violacea , as representative of the floristic element that distin- guishes the Illinois savannas. While preparing a taxonomie revision of North American lespedezas (7 ), I was struck by the preponderance of specimens that had been collected where the eastern deciduous forests meet fire-dependent communities - i.e., mid- western prairies and southeastern pine savannas. It seems as if this border had once been the center of distribution for no less than 1 0 species of Lespedeza . Today, lespedezas are more diffusely distributed, perhaps having undergone an exodus to other regions along the many roadsides that were created during the past two centuries. Although this scenario is probably over simplified, there is no reason to deny the possibility that Lespedeza , at least in North America, is basically a genus of Packard's savannas and their vicarious ecological counterparts elsewhere. Earlier, I described one such vicarious com- munity, a pine-oak- hickory woodland in northern Florida (2). Here, Pinus echinata , Quercus stellata , and Carya tomentosa form an open overstoiy above a dense and floristically rich undergrowth dominated by grasses and legumes. Occasional sur- face fires prevent most other forest species from colonizing. This community is juxtaposed between the more frequently burned longleaf pinelands {Pinus palustris ) and the essentially unburned mag- nolia-beech forests, dominated by Magnolia gran- diflora , Fagus grandifolia , Quercus alba , etc. This pine-oak-hickory community has several parallels with Packard's savannas. Both are open woodlands with a dense, herbaceous ground cover, including lespedezas. Both experience occasional fires. Both separate fire lands from unburned forest. Both have distinctive floras, which differentiate them from ecotones or segments of a continuum. Old-growth remnants of both have been nearly ex- tirpated. Both were described in writings of early naturalists. There is yet another parallel. Commen- surate with Packard's experience, contemporary ecologists are reluctant to accept the existence of a pine-oak-hickory woodland community. Conven- tional ecological wisdom fails to separate pine-oak- hickory woods from the occasionally burned and floristically distinct forests that have abundantly colonized fallow agricultural lands of the region. Another vicarious community exists far from Illinois savannas in the Mosquitia region of Hon- duras. Geomorphologically, this Caribbean lowland is an outlier of the coastal plain that begins on Long Island and continues southward around Florida to Texas. A frequently burned grass-sedge Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="2">83 community occupies infertile sand flats of the Mosquitia. Interior uplands support tropical rain forest, which is immune to fire. In between lies the pine-oak- nance woodland, arguably the counterpart to Packard's savannas and to the pine-oak-hickory woodlands in Florida. Dominant species in this occasionally burned vegetation are Pinus caribaea , Quercus oleoides , Brysomma eras sif olia , and a plethora of grasses, legumes (no lespedezas this time), melastomes, even tree ferns. Again, there is a floristic element that sets the pine-oak-nance com- munity apart from both the neighboring grass-sedge community and the tropical rain forest. For the pine-oak-nance community, though, there was no previous literature that confirmed its historical existence. I guess I am a modern-day Dr. Mead for the Mosquitia, and perhaps the Steve Pack- ard of a subsequent generation can piece together another penetrating story, based on my field notes (3)!

Test Effect of Weed Removal on Prairie Species Survival (Illinois) Russell R. Kirt and Robert A. Durnberger, Natural Science Division, College of DuPage, Glen Ellyn, IL 60137 (312) 858-2800, ext. 2304. A two-year study was undertaken to address the survival capability of four prairie species, big blues- tem (Andropogon gerardi ), prairie cordgrass ( Spar- tirla pectinata ), prairie dock (Silphium terebinthinaceumX and wild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa ), planted as seedlings in weeded and non- weeded conditions in a degraded meadow. The study site was divided into alternating weeded and non-weeded 1 m x 1 m quadrats. It was then planted with 438 seedlings. The weed removal treatment consisted of eliminating visible weedy plant material to a depth of 5 cm in a 0.03 square meter area (radius = 10 cm) around half of the seedlings. Statistical analyses indicate that there was no significant difference in survival between seedlings on cleared and uncleared plots after the first two growing seasons. This suggests that it may not be worthwhile to remove adjacent existing weedy plants when planting these four prairie species into old field meadows. It also suggests an alternative approach for establishing low quality prairie in areas that are small, steeply inclined, or otherwise un- suitable for conventional soil preparation like disc- ing, plowing, and roto-tilling. This method might also be useful in developing buffer areas surround- ing pristine prairie remnants. A detailed account of this research has recently been submitted for publication in the Transactions of the Illinois Academy of Science. 74. 243-Hectare Prairie/Savanna Restoration Project Uses Strip Planting, Sod Rescue, and Skid Loader (Illinois) John Aavang and Brad Wilson, The Nature Conser- vancy, Illinois Office, 79 W. Monroe, Chicago, DL 60603 (312)346-8166. Work began June 1, 1989, on a tallgrass prairie and oak savanna restoration project at the Poplar Creek Forest Preserve in northwest Cook County. The site is approximately 243-ha (600 acres) in size with a 24.3-ha degraded oak savanna on its southeastern edge. The remaining acreage is an abandoned field, which will be restored to tallgrass prairie. Along the northern boundary is Shoe Fac- tory Road Prairie, a very high quality gravel hill prairie. Early in June the field was plowed with contour strips 5.4 m wide and roughly 12 m apart. This exposed 8.3-ha of land which will be planted with big bluestem, Indiangrass, and other seed donated by Fermilab ( R&amp;MN 5(2):60). Over time these plants will spread into the unseeded areas to compete with the non-native species. More plowed strips are planned for the future. Arrangements are also underway to rescue large pieces of virgin prairie sod from a road-widening site. These will then be planted at Poplar Creek and monitored to gauge the usefulness of this method in re-introducing difficult to propagate flora and small fauna. In addition, the Prairie Woods Audubon Society will be monitoring the various bird species and their populations. A midsummer insect survey will be conducted to establish a baseline for further studies. The savanna, which had been pastured until the late 1960s, is now home to only the hardiest spring flora such as solomon's seal, wild geranium, bloodroot, wild hyacinth, shooting star, and a few other forbs and sedges. It has become overgrown with a dense understory of European buckthorn, black cherry, box elder, maple and grape vine. These will be removed by felling the trees and then treating the stumps with Garlón 4 to prevent resprouting. The brush will then either be chipped by the Forest Preserve or pushed into piles for on- site burning. To prevent damage from radiant heat, any burning will take place while a light rain is falling. To handle the enormous amount of brush in- volved, a skid loader will be employed in those areas which are largely devoid of any sensitive flora. Areas where such flora exists will be marked with orange flagging and hand cleared by either interns or volunteers. Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="3">84 However, we see the skid loader as an important tool, one with several important advantages over a regular tractor. These advantages include: 1) the operator is better positioned to see that the bucket edge remains off the ground thus avoiding scraping the soil surface; 2) the four-wheel drive capability reduces the risk of spinning tires; and 3) its small size combined with a short turning radius enables it to maneuver in tight areas. Skidding brush is also an especially effective technique because as brush is pushed over the ground, the unwanted woody plants, such as grapevine, multiflora rose and bar- berry, become entangled and uprooted. Meanwhile, the herbaceous savanna plants merely bend over, allowing the brush to slide by. Reseeding in the savanna area will be done with bottle brush grass (Hystrix patula ), woodland brome ( Bromus Kalmii ), downy rye ( Elymus villosus ), Vir- ginia rye ( Elymus Virginicus ), and wood reed (Cinna armdinacea ) and savanna forbs (as listed by Pack- ard, R&amp;MN 6(1): 13). These herbs, along with the oak leaves, will supply the necessary fuel for the fires that will keep the brushin check. Seed for the savanna and additional seed for the prairie are being collected by volunteers. All seed will come from spontaneous populations within 50 miles of the site. 75. Restoration of a Texas Hill Country Roadside David Mahler and Judy Walther, Environmental Survey Consulting, 4602 Placid Place, Austin, Texas 78731 (512)458-8531 Restoration of the grass and forb components of the Texas hill country savanna vegetation was in- itiated in May, 1988 along Steiner Ranch Boulevard in Travis County, Texas. Approximately 12-ha along approximately 3 km of roadway were revegetated at the end of construction, utilizing a thin application of salvaged topsoil, a spring and fall seeding, and a small number of locally salvaged transplants. The road was constructed through steep lime- stone hill country, which supports a diverse grassland- woodland mosaic. The grassland is dominated by little bluestem, Boutelova spp., Muh- lenbergia spp., Sporobolus spp. and a rich forb mix- ture including numerous composites, mints and legumes. The woodlands are dominated by juniper and three oak species, plus a diverse shrub com- ponent. This road corridor contained gravelly top- soil in thin deposits on the flat topographic benches and in deeper pockets along stream channels. Soil material was stockpiled during construction and later spread on the graded roadsides. Seed was harvested using the Grin Reaper and a Front-end Tractor Reaper developed by Environ- mental Survey Consulting (see R&amp;MN 6(1):23). The harvested seed heads were shredded and sup- plemented with purchased seed of three species. Over 100 species were harvested, and estimates of abundance noted. Three spring seed mixes and three fall mixes were developed for short mowing areas adjacent to the road, taller areas further away from the road, and moister areas along drainage channels. Some areas received their first seeding in May, 1988; others in Fall, 1988 or March, 1989. Ap- proximately 20 bushels (700 1) of shredded seed heads per 0.4-ha were utilized, with 2/3 of that amount in the first seeding. The seed mix was spread by hand, the first seeding being raked with a drag harrow and the second being over-seeded. Transplanting was accomplished during the winter, using sod salvaged from future construction areas. No fertilizers or supplementary watering was ap- plied. Approximately 95 percent of the area met City of Austin coverage requirements by June, 1989, at 4, 8, and 12 months after the initial seeding. A significant diversity of native species has already begun to develop at this early stage. 76. Restoring Mixed-Grass Prairie in a Cultivated Field (Texas) Terri Siegenthaler, Project Managei/Superinten- dent, Hamilton Pool Park, Travis County Parks Department, P. O. Box 1748, Austin, TX 78767 (512) 264-2740; and Katy McKinney and Marcia Herman, National Wildflower Research Center, 2600 FM 973 North, Austin, TX 78725-4201 (512) 929-3600 Little is known about the pre-settlement grassland mosaic on the Edwards Plateau in Texas. Intensive grazing and farming activities since the mid- 1800 's on predominantly thin calcareous soils have extirpated many of the later successional grass and forb species, leaving few examples of pristine grassland in the region. Hamilton Pool Park, a small county park in central Texas, may someday be a good example of the native mixed-grass prairie that once characterized this region. On the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau, the Hamilton Pool area has been highly disturbed over the past 100 years. Its upland, creekside, and canyon habitats have been grazed, browsed, cul- tivated, and heavily used by people for decades. Four years ago, Travis county purchased 93.5-ha including the popular collapsed limestone grotto, and initiated a management program to restore, preserve, and enhance the native habitats within the park. The 8. 1-ha cropfield, with its relatively thick alluvial layers of silty clay, is being restored as a mixed-grass prairie for several reasons: to control erosion and restore the area, to protect the state archeological landmark, which overlaps the field, and to serve as a seedbank for restoration work in other disturbed areas. Due to high park visitation, this project also lends itself to environmental educa- Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="4">85 tion about the importance, restoration, and manage- ment of grassland communities. A research plot in 2.5-ha of the old cropfield at Hamilton Pool Park has been set up with the Nation- al Wildflower Research Center to document the effects of restoration efforts and determine the effec- tiveness of various restoration techniques. The project consists of three phases: sampling the exist- ing vegetation, conducting series of controlled burns and native seed plantings, and monitoring the effects of our treatments on the grassland for two to five years. To study the vegetation composition, eight transects were laid out with fifteen permanent, one square-meter plots established along each transect. The plots were surveyed in January, 1989. We found that, after laying fallow for five years, the field had 80 percent cover of mostly early- successional na- tive species such as poverty dropseed {Sporobolus vaginaeflorus ), various three-awns ( Aristida spp.), grassbur (Cenchrus incertus ), and Mexican hat ( Ratibida columnaris). The entire field was mowed in February just before conducting a prescribed burn on two-thirds of the field, including half of the research plot. In March, the center section of the research area was seeded, half in the burned area and half in the unburned area. A total of 3.0 kg of native grass seed was planted including: Indiangrass ( Sor - ghastrum nutans ), sideoats grama (Bouteloua cur- tipendulo ), bushy bluestem ( Andropogon glomeratus) and nine other species. This area also was seeded with 1 .5 kg of the forbs wooly ironweed ( Vernonia lindheimeri) and gayfeather (Liatris sp.). AU seed stock used was locally hand-harvested, broadcast and hand-raked by a team of volunteers. Examples of high quality mixed-grass prairie, for the most part, no longer exist. We are, however, studying the species diversity, densities and associa- tions of several relatively healthy grasslands in the area to determine seeding strategies and harvesting needs. By adding to the diversity and re- introduc- ing fire as a management tool, we hope to restore a grassland community resembling the pre-settlement vegetation typical of the Hamilton Pool area. The information we gather is being shared with park visitors and will be used to encourage similar mixed- grass prairies restoration programs on other dis- turbed lands of the Edwards Plateau. 77. Native Prairie Plant Mix Developed and Tested for ROW Use (Colorado) Gayle Weinstein, Project Manager, Director of Plant Collections, Denver Botanic Gardens, 909 York Street, Denver, CO 80206-3799 (303)331-4000. The Denver Botanical Garden, with funding from the Martin Marietta Corporation, has begun a three- year program (1988-1990) to develop and evaluate a native prairie seed mix for use by the Colorado Highway Department. The research is taking place at DGB 's Chatfield Arboretum and in an adjacent area along state highway 121. This is the first re- search in Colorado to explore how native plant communities might be economically utilized on highway right-of-ways. Both ethical and practical considerations were a concern to researchers. Care was taken, therefore, to clearly identify and resolve important issues before proceeding. These issues included the neces- sity to maintain genetic diversity; establishing the distinctions between "wildflower" and "cultivated plant," "restoration" and "reclamation"; the species selection process and its economic limitations; and the integrity of wild plant communities and the dangers of overcollection. To resolve these issues, specific parameters were developed to guide in the collection, production, and selection of species in- volved in the project. During 1988, the research team began to compile a list of native Colorado short and midgrass prairie species (Agropyrvn- Stipa community) which were originally present on the Arboretum site prior to highway construction, or species ecologically similar to the original inhabitants. At the same time they devised a numerical rating system to evaluate species in terms of production and establishment. Previous research concerning prairie planting, im- plementation, and maintenance was also studied to determine appropriate research questions. Finally, seeds were collected, identified and sown in the nursery in order to produce sufficient seed for both the test plot and the highway area plantings. In 1989, researchers will sow two test sites, one on a clay soil, the other on a sandy loam soil. They will then monitor the wildflower mix's performance at each of these sites in relation to soil type, irrigation and planting technique. Both sites will include two 17 m X 1 1 m plots, one plot will be irrigated, the other will not. Each plot is subdivided in six 3.2 m x 11 m sub- plots, three of which will be hydroseeded and three of which will be seeded by drilling into a sorghum cover crop. Plant cover and frequency will be measured in each plot on a one-foot quadrant basis. A single, implanted 3.2 m x 1 1 m control plot at each site will serve as a reference. Monitoring will continue into 1990, as the high- way site is prepared for its September planting. Considerations for this final planting mix will in- clude an evaluation of a species' production feasibility, ease of establishment, pioneer or climax species status, erosion control potential, nitrogen fixation capability, aesthetic value and visibility, and the overall grass/forb ratio. Finally, the researchers will evaluate the data and summarize the project. It is expected that this par- ticular research will continue and that further inves- tigations into wild seed propagation, wildflower mixes, other planting and maintenance techniques will be expanded following this study.

Box 455, Rio Vista, CA 94571 (916)775-1646 Conservaseed is a private seed producing farm that specializes in developing and growing native and naturalized clovers and grasses for California. Over 24 ha has recently been planted to five major native perennial grasses for use in the revegetation and restoration trade. Native perennial grasses presently available in- clude: purple needlegrass, (Stipa pulchra ); meadow barley, (Hordeum brachyantherum ); California brome, (Bromus carìnatus)' a drought tolerant variety of native red fescue, (Festuca rubra ); and five varieties of blue wildrye, (Elymus glaucus). Native perennial grasses that will be available in the future include: California melic, (Melica califor- nica); foothill melic, (M imperfecta ); nodding stipa, (S. cernua); and the native foothill Idaho fescue, (F. idahoensis). The current restoration policies and practices in California call for exotic annual grasses such as sofichess, (Bromus mollis) or annual ryegrass, (Lolium multiflorum) to be seeded in grassland areas. The use of these species often precludes the establishment of the native perennial grasses. The production of native perennial grasses in large quan- tities should have a growing effect on future restora- tion and revegetation practices in the state. 79. Heathland Restoration: A Handbook of Tech- niques. 1988. British Gas and the Environ- mental Advisory Unit, University of Liverpool. British Gas, Southhampton, Hampshire, England. 159 pages. Through a careful review and analysis of case studies, British Gas and the Environmental Ad- visory Unit of the University of Liverpool have compiled a technical guide to the various methods used in restoring damaged or disturbed heathland habitats. The manual is divided into four chapters, each organized around a general outline which includes background material, methodology, and, finally, recommendations. The initial chapter provides a brief introduction to heathland ecology. Chapter Two presents an overview of the environmental problems facing this plant community - disturban- ces due to laying natural gas pipelines, for ex- ample - and offers case studies of subsequent restoration efforts. The manual's essence lies, however, in the third chapter, where the methods of heathland plant establishment are discussed. Here the techniques of seed banking, turving, sprigging and seed planting are all described in all their posi- tive and negative aspects. Topics such as plant material collection, installation, and necessary planting amendments are also covered. Provisions for the short-term care and protection of the restora- tion are the focus of the final chapter. A useful section of appendices completes the manual with details of case studies, materials and suppliers, along with lists of groups and organizations involved in heathland restoration in the United Kingdom. Overall, this handbook represents an informa- tive, focused, technical guide to heathland restora- tion. If it fails anywhere, it does so due to a lack of discussion about broader issues, issues like plant diversity, wildlife, and/or long-term management. Furthermore, it contains no new or innovative res- toration techniques, even though its main audience is those specialists involved exclusively in heath- land work. What is valuable about this book, however, is that it brings together all the useful heathland restoration techniques into one comprehensive source. And through this collection, British Gas and the Environ- mental Advisory Unit have accomplished what they set out to do - provide an informative reference that would make a useful field guide for the heathland restorationist.

Management and restoration of prairie groves. Steve Packard, The Nature Conservancy, Chicago, IL. An experimental effort to restore a prairie grove was begun in 1983 by a volunteer group, the North Branch Prairie Project ( R&amp;MN 6(1): 13-20). The principal vegetation was bur oak with an understory of European buckthorn. Two years of burning produced little change in the groundlayer. In 1985, the group began seeding with a mixture of species found principally on woodland edges. Since then the grove has rapidly developed a native herbaceous matrix of savanna species with few prairie taxa. 8 1 . FROM: The Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of SERM, 1 989. 81.1. Restoration and management of California'a grassland habitats. David Amme, Berkeley, CA; Barbara Pitschel. Since the 18th century, nearly all of California's grasslands have been converted from native perennials to exotic annual grasses. More recently, however, public agencies and preserves are beginning to focus on restoration of perennial grassland habitats. There is also a need in the private sector for perennial grasses to enhance grazing and wildlife habitat. 8 1 .2. The ecological significance of grasslands created using vegeta- tion cut from ancient English meadows. Grant H. Jones, School of Applied Science, The Polytechnic Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England; and Ian C. Trueman and Peter Millet. This paper discusses the use of hay cut from species-rich meadows as seed sources for the creation on new meadow areas. Success was reported with the method at Wolverhampton in 1983-84. Eight new meadows were established in 1987-88 using a similar method. 82. FROM: The 17th Annual Prairie Grouse Technical Conference. 82. 1 . Effects of grazing management treatment on grassland plant com- munities and prairie grouse habitat. Llewellyn L. Manské, Wil- liam T. Baker, and Mario E. Biondini. Prairie grouse populations respond to changes in grassland vegetation cover. They avoid areas subject to season-long grazing Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="6">87 because those areas lack the cover necessary for courtship dis- plays and nesting. Twice-grazed treatments showed a benefit to grassland vegetation, prairie grouse habitat and population. 82.2. Habitat usage by prairie grouse on the Sheyenne National Grasslands. Llewellyn L. Manské and William T. Barker. Spring and summer habitat usage was primarily in the upland and midland grassland habitat types dominated by switchgrass (Panicům virgatum). Habitat usage shifted during the fall and winter to cropland and associated tree shelterbelts. 83. Lands for Grasslands National Park acquired in Canada In September, 1988, the Canadian federal and Saskatchewan governments signed Grasslands National Park into existence. While the legislation is a major step towards saving and restoring the shortgrass prairie, implementation will require additional acquisitions and funding from both the private and public sectors. 84. Plant and bird communities of native prairie and introduced Eurasian vegetation in Manitoba, Canada. 1989. Scott D. Wil- son, Ecosystem Dynamics Group, Research School of Biologi- cal Science, The Australian National University, GPO 475, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; and Joyce W. Belcher, Depart- ment of Biology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, KIN 6N5, Canada. Conservation Biology. 3(l):39-44. These researchers examined the impact of introduced plants on both native vegetation and bird communities in a mosaic of North American mixed shortgrass prairie and Eurasian vegeta- tion. Results indicate that the Eurasian species not only replace the native plant community but also produce significant changes in the bird species found in the area. 85. Numbers and biomass of selected insect groups on burned and unburned sand prairie. Roger C. Anderson, Theresa Leahy and Shivcharn S. Dhillion, Department of Biological Sciences, Il- linois State University, Normal, IL 6'J6'. American Midland. Naturalist. 1989. 122(1): 15 1-162. A three-year study following a single spring burn indicates that insect groups differed in their responses to fire. None, however, experienced a severe population decline, suggesting all are adapted to fire. 86. Effects of prescribed burning on Andropogon scoparius in post- agricultural grasslands in Connecticut. William A. Niering and Glenn D. Dreyer, Department of Botany, Connecticut College and Connecticut College Arboretum, New London, CT 06230. American Midland Naturalist. 1989. 122(1):88-102. Following 17 years of annual and biennial burning of post- agricultural Andropogon scoparius grasslands, these researchers have noted that Andropogon biomass is greater in burned than in unburned areas. They have developed a multifactor, qualitative model involving increases in light, soil moisture and temperature, mineralization, nitrogen-fixing species and ash to explain this difference. 87. An unusual oak savanna in northeastern Wisconsin: The effect of Indian-caused fire. Cheryl H. Dorney, 3417 E. Jameson Rd., Raleigh, NC 27604; and John R. Dorney, Environmental Management, North Carolina Department of Natural Resour- ces and Community Development, Raleigh, NC 276 1 1 . American Midland Naturalist. 1989. 122(1): 103-1 13. Discusses the disjunctive effect on vegetation caused by the native Americans' use of fire.

Canopy Reduction, Fire Influence Oak Regeneration (Wisconsin) Adrian P. Wydeven and Glenn G. Kloes, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, 647 Lakeland Road, Shawano, WI 54166 (715)524-2183 Because of the importance of red oak ( Quercus rubra ) forests for wildlife, several attempts to im- prove oak regeneration were conducted at the Navarino Wildlife Area in northeastern Wisconsin. Previous work by Sloan and Zastrow (1985) at Navarino suggested that reducing tree canopy to 70 percent crown density through timber harvests would greatly improve oak regeneration. Canopy reductions, as part of shelterwood cut, alone do not seem to adequately regenerate oaks. Because fire has historically been associated with oak forests, we felt prescribed burning might be useful in encourag- ing better oak regeneration. Also fire might be used in natural areas or old growth stands to maintain oak trees. Examinations were made on effects of burning on both cut and uncut stands. On May 5, 1987, we burned 6 ha of a 25-ha oak stand that had been reduced to 70 percent crown density by a timber harvest in 1984. The same day a burn was also conducted on 2 ha of a 12-ha uncut oak stand with 95 percent crown density. Both stands had been similar in structure and composition prior to the 1984 cut and were about 100 years old. The burn through the uncut stand was fairly cool, with flames 0.3-0.56 m. high, while the cut stand burned very hot with flames 0.5 to 6.0 m. high. Oak seedling numbers per hectare early the fol- lowing fall were as follows in the four treatments: uncut forest - not burned, 1504; uncut forest - burned, 1856; cut forest - not burned, 4189; and cut forest - burned, 54 14. Burning did seem to increase seedling numbers slightly, although the differences were not significant (P&gt;0.10 Student t-test). Burn- ing did seem to be effective in reducing competition from some other woody plants such as witch hazel ( Hamamelis virginiana) and red maple ( Acer rubra) (Wydeven, 1989). Also, burning was somewhat detrimental to the large trees in the cut stand. Canopy reduction to 70 percent crown density seems to be an effective means for increasing oak seedling numbers. Burning may be used to further increase oak seedling and may be useful in reducing competition from other vegetation, but needs to be used cautiously to avoid killing large trees. Addi- tional sampling is planned for the future to deter- mine how well oaks have established several years after the burns. References: Sloan, K. R. and D. E. Zastrow. 1985.

Reforestation of a Cleared Bottomland Hardwood Area in Northeast Louisiana L. Savage, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, P. O. Box 4004, Monroe, Louisiana 71211, (318) 343-4004; D. W. Pritchett and C. E. DePoe, Department of Biology, Northeast Louisiana University, Monroe, Louisiana 71209, (318) 342-4148. In the fall of 1984 the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries purchased 2,275-ha of cleared bottomland along Bayou Lafourche in northeastern Louisiana. This large tract was cleared during the early 1960s and farmed continuously prior to the sale. This area has poorly drained, heavy clay soil and is periodically flooded. Since acquisition, the Department has under- taken an active reforestation program by replanting approximately 365 ha each year. To date 1,335 ha have been replanted with native hardwoods consist- ing primarily of oaks (Quercus nuttallii , Q. phellos , Q. lyrata , Q. shumardii , Q. nigra , Q. laurifolia , and Q. michauxii). Quercus alba, Q. falcata var. falcata , and Q. falcata var. pagodaefolia , along with cypress ( Taxodium distichum) and sweet pecan (Carya il- linoensis) in limited areas. Planting sites for each species were selected on the basis of the frequency and duration of flooding in the area and the relative tolerance of individual species to flooding. Sixty percent (809 ha) of the replanting was done with nursery-raised seedlings and the remainder (526 ha) with field-collected acorns, following seed-storage and direct-seeding procedures developed at the Southern Hardwood Research Station in Stoneville, Mississippl. Approximately 400,000 seedlings have been planted, with most of these (360,000) being hand-planted. On the higher sites with lighter soils and better drainage, seedlings were planted in a 3.6 x 3.6 m grid resulting in approximately 740 seedlings per ha. Seedlings were planted in a 4.5 x 4.5 m grid (500 per ha) in the lower, more frequently flooded areas. During the first three years of this project, one-year seedling survival rates generally have been con- sidered adequate (x = 64 percent, range 41 percent to 84 percent) to ensure the survival of 370 seedlings per ha (150 per acre). So far over 10,400 kg (23,000 lbs) of acorns have been collected from throughout Louisiana for use in this project. Some of these acorns were used to generate the nursery seedlings. The remainder were planted directly on the site. Acorns were sown in rows 3.6 m apart at a density of approximately 2,900 seeds per ha (1,200 per acre). To date, germination rates during the first three years (1985-1987) have matched survival rates for out- planted seedlings, resulting in a final density of approximately 370 per ha. Germination rates were greatly reduced follow- ing last year's (1988) drought, with only Q. nuttallii germinating well under these conditions. By the end of this year, approximately 200 ha will have been replanted due to inadequate seedling sur- vival or germination. Those species which were present in greater abundance prior to clearing (Q. nuttallii , Q. phellos , and Q. lyrata ) have had the best survival and germination rates. Most of the area to be replanted (140 ha) was first planted in 1988 shortly before the beginning of the drought. Approximately 700 ha of the area are being managed for waterfowl. In 1987 Ducks Unlimited awarded $ 100,000 to the Department for the enhan- cement of the waterfowl habitat in this tract. Funds were used for the construction of water control structures and approximately 13 km of levees, and for conversion of electric pumps to diesel. In addi- tion, an all-weather road leading to a public obser- vation tower has been constructed. The waterfowl habitat consists of 260 ha of moist-soil management sites, 260 ha of "green tree" reservoirs (or wooded areas that are deliberately flooded seasonally) and a permanent 1 80 ha agricultural unit. The agricultural unit will be planted in soybeans and rice and then flooded during the winter months. The waterfowl area is divided into two units with one serving as a refuge and the other open to the public for hunting. In coordination with the Department of Biology at Northeast Louisiana University, study plots have been set aside throughout the tract to study secon- dary succession in this area (see DePoe and Pritchett, 1986). Floristic surveys of this area indi- cate that this is a species-rich environment with over 250 taxa recorded to date. Studies of the roles of selected plants (Aster spp. and Sesbania macrocar- pa) in disturbed fields are currently being carried out on this area. In addition, the effect of disking, burn- ing, and periodic flooding on succession are being investigated as management techniques to arrest succession and thereby maintain a variety of habitats. An initial survey of non-game birds oc- cupying the area has recently been concluded. Studies concerned with the establishment of ground- dwelling arthropods and the seasonal variation of macroinvertebrates in the flooded areas are planned. Reference: DePoe, C. E. and D. W.

Studies were undertaken in 17 historic oak savannas in north- eastern Illinois and northwestern Indiana. Comparison of pre- and post-burn vegetation indicated that in all instances controlled fire reduced the number of exotics or mesic species in favor of prairie or savanna associates. Periodic fire also appears to increase faunai diversity. A strategy of frequent fires is suggested in the early stages of converting an oak woodland to savanna. Thereafter, less frequent burns interspersed with a hot fire every five to ten years is suggested. 90.3. Unresolved issues on forest replacement. Andre F. Clewell, A. F.

Recovery may be sped-up, however, by adjusting the species composition, reducing density and removing exotics. This would require a clear understanding of both existing conditions and the forest's character prior to logging. 91 . How fast can trees migrate? Leslie Roberts. 1989. Science, v. 243 pp. 735-737.

American Midland Naturalist. 1989. 122(1): 133-141. This study of secondary succession of eastern white pine ( Pinus strobus) found that invasion following a disturbance does not proceed similarly in all stands. It suggests that initially there is a substantial random component in colonization which is then influenced by different levels of biotic and abiotic factors, all of which combine to produce different rates of succession. 100. The bionomics of tree planting. Jeff Elliot. Earth First! Novem- ber 1, 1988. Elliot argues that large-scale tree planting following clearcut- ting should be aimed at the development of ecologically sound forest ecosystems which are representative of the bioregion rather than monocultures of economically-orientated species. He also argues against practice of planting trees alone and favors instead restoring forest ecosystems - trees, fungi, soils and their microcrobes, birds, shrubs, animals, and herbs. 101.

Factors Influencing Reintroduction of Aquatic Macrophytes Studied (Wisconsin) Bob Wakeman, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Milwaukee, WI 53212 (414) 562-9691; Dr. Don Les, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Department of Biological Sciences, Milwaukee, WI 53201 (414)229-6728 Recently, there has been a considerable interest in developing techniques to restore plant and animal communities native to lake littoral zones. Success- ful reintroduction of native species into aquatic habitats should theoretically depend on restoring water quality along with the ability of natives to compete with non- indigenous species. Although the water quality of many lakes has been improved as a result of nonpoint source pollution controls, little attention has been directed at the question of interspecific competition between native and non- indigenous submergent aquatic species. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), in cooperation with several Lake Management Districts, is interested in littoral zone reconstruction involving the displacement of foreign species, such as Eurasian water-milfoil ( Myriophyllum spicatum ), by native aquatics. To this end the WDNR has engaged the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee's Department of Biological Sciences to determine the feasibility of increasing the natural diversity of submerged macrophytes in two Waukesha County lakes with "good" water quality - Lac La Belle and Okauchee Lake. The investigation began with an assessment of inter- specific competition between M spicatum and Large-leaved Pondweed ( Potamogetón amplifolius ), a native species that was determined a likely candidate for successful re-establishment. In 1987, experiments with P. amplifolius and M spicatum were conducted to record the extent of their competition in newly established plantings. The results indicated that the local lake conditions rather than competitive interaction determined the success of the P. amplifolius . This provided the first evidence contrary to the widely accepted belief that M. spicatum actively displaces native vegetation as a result of competition. It also suggested that the re-introduction of native species, such as P. amplifolius is feasible in lakes of suitable water quality. The objectives of the 1988 study were to deter- mine the optimum water depth for both species in Lac La Belle, and to determine whether Illinois pondweed (P. illinoensis) would have a higher per- cent survival rate in the highly organic substrate in Okauchee Lake. The results from the Okauchee Lake experiments showed a very low survival of P. illinoensis. Depth experiments in Lac La Belle revealed that the optimum depths for P. amplifolius and M. spicatum were overlapping. However, the percent survival of P. amplifolius was greater than M. spicatum in deeper water. Future studies scheduled for 1990-91 will deter- mine the importance of sediment nutrient relation- ships in regulating the distribution of a variety of aquatic plants. 103. Wild Rice Research May Provide Model for Other Wetland Restoration (Wisconsin) James E. Meeker, Botany Department, University of Wisconsin- Madison, Madison, WI 53706; and Joseph R. Rose, Bad River Natural Resource Department, P. O. Box 39, Odanah, WI 54861. Wetland restorations have not always been suc- cessful for two primary reasons: (1) most wetland restoration designs have not included enough land to assure that the natural disturbance processes (primarily water level fluctuations) are re- estab- lished; and (2) for some wetland community types, adequate model communities no longer exist. Recent attempts to restore northern wild rice habitats offer a classic example of both problems. We report here on some problems associated with present wild rice restoration attempts and suggest possible new directions in these activities. Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="10">91 Northern wild rice (Zizania palustrus L. var. palustris) is a native North American grain that was once abundant in the shallow waters of gently flow- ing streams and rivers, as well as at the point where these streams and rivers entered into lakes. During the past century, human activity led to a precipitous decline in both lake and river habitat necessary for viable wild rice populations. Wild rice restoration to date has been concerned with little more than re-seeding shallow lakes and impoundments in order to increase the harvest of this natural resource. While these restorations have been successful over the short run, there are indica- tions that they are not self-sustaining because natural disturbances in the form of fluctuating water levels have not been restored. Furthermore, they fail to account for the influence of dam building by beavers on the community structure of natural wet- lands. Thus, not only do we have few riverine areas where water levels are unregulated, but the few that remain are lacking the major factor which provided for the necessary biological flux. In order to respond to the problems posed by previous wild rice restoration attempts, we have been studying its community dynamics in the Kakagon Slough, a natural area on the shores of Lake Superior in northern Wisconsin. This pristine area has two qualities that make it an excellent location to study the community dynamics of wild rice. First, it contains riverine wetlands that ex- emplify the once prime habitat for the species. Here the natural scouring and sedimentation processes are still functioning, providing both open habitat for colonization and nutrients for rapid growth. Secondly, we suggest that the periodic fluctuations in Lake Superior's water level mimic the natural disturbances brought about by beaver impound- ments. In the Kakagon wetlands we have been able to monitor the yearly dynamics in both the riverine and the lake-like habitats. Both continue to have natural processes intact. Our preliminary results have suggested that wild rice may be enhancing its own numbers by trapping sediment-laden waters early in the growing season, in this way supplying its demand for nutrients later in the summer. In addition, we have seen that the extreme drawdown in Lake Superior levels from 1986 to 1988 favored wild rice. Both in riverine and lake-like habitats these drawdowns allowed this an- nual species to rapidly colonize areas that once were too deep for most aquatic vegetation. In this same manner, beaver dam collapse may have once aided the pulsing wild rice stands in riparian areas. 104. Wetland Restoration Project to Reduce Flood- ing, Enhance Wildlife Habitat (South Dakota) Valeree Bakken, National Wildlife Federation, Prairie Wetlands Resource Center, 1605 E. Capitol Avenue, Bismarck, ND 58501 (701)222-2442 Lake Thompson is a large prairie wetland in eastern South Dakota. Originally it covered ap- proximately 2,833 ha and has been listed as a Na- tional Historic Landmark because of its unique wildlife values. However, excessive precipitation during 1982-1986, combined with widespread wet- land drainage in the area from 1950 to 1985, caused the lake to swell to 6,875 ha, flooding private lands, farm buildings, homes and roads. In response, in February, 1987 Governor George S. Mickelson created the Lake Thompson Task Force. As a follow-up to Task Force recommenda- tions, he created the Wetland Preservation and Res- toration Committee, endorsing wetland restoration as an effective long-term way of reducing flooding problems while enhancing wildlife habitat. Prairie Wetlands Resource Center (PWRC) staff were rep- resentatives on the Task Force and have been ap- pointed to the Wetland Restoration Committee. They have played a major role in coordinating a restoration approach to the problems in the Lake Thompson Watershed. Through PWRC efforts, the National Wildlife Federation, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have entered into a cooperative venture to develop and implement the Lake Thompson Water Management Plan. The plan calls for wetlands protection and restoration measures as well as upland habitat rejuvenation and management programs - all with the overall objec- tive of providing long-term flood protection while enhancing fish and wildlife production. The NWF has coordinated the participation of a number of State and Federal agencies in this cooperative effort. The USFWS has made a com- mitment to fund perpetual wetland easements. The SDGFP is prepared to do the restoration work, cost- share the seeding of uplands, and provide waterfowl nesting structures and maintenance. Funds are needed for the lease agreements in order to finalize this comprehensive wetland restoration/manage- ment project. 105. FROM: The Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of SERM, 1989. 105. 1 .

Effects of mowing on a woolgrass ( Scirpus cyperinus) domin- ated sedge meadow in southeastern Wisconsin. John Larson and Forest Stearns, Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee. These researchers studied the effects of mowing a woolgrass sedge meadow in an attempt to reduce woody vegetation. The results from two successive annual mowings indicate that Salix spp., Rhamnus frángula , and Populus tremuloides , while tem- porarily reduced in stature, were not eliminated. July mowings were found to reduce Phalaris arundinacea and Caiamagrostis canadensis. 105.3. Meadows Drive habitat enhancement plan. Ricardo Villasenor, EIP Associates, 150 Spear Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. To permit the filling of six acres of wetlands a mitigation plan was developed to restore an area that supports both wetland and upland habitat. Project planners were concerned with avoiding adverse impact to the habitat of the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse, enhancing wetland habitat by providing enough tidal fluctuation and inundation, reducing impacts to existing wet- lands, and minimizing mosquito problems. 106.

Bauder, Dept. of Biology, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92 182. This one-year study investigates ways to enhance damaged or disturbed vernal pools. Removal of Polypogon monspeliensis , enabled the endangered pool species, Pogogyne abramsii , to flourish. Recontouring and decompaction of the soil also appear to add significantly to the establishment of P. abramsii by seed. 106.2.

The results suggest that a 5:1 (watershed-to-pool area) ratio is satisfactory for 12" deep ponds. Also suggests that deeper ( 18"-24") pools with more distance between them will increase the duration of available water thus resulting in enhanced species richness and vigor. 106.3.

The successful creation of vernal pools requires knowledge of more than just water depth, i.e., edaphic factors like claypan depth and soil moisture capacity, climatic data such as rainfall frequency and intensity. Large, run-off-dependent channel pools are most greatly influenced by pool depth, area, volume, pool bottom elevation, and the width and height of the inlet. Pools on slightly sloping ground are more dependent on edaphic factors, slope shape, and the proximity and size of nearby pools and their water sources. 106.6.

As part of a Section 404 mitigation settlement, the city of Sacramento created 82.7 acres of vernal pools. The existence of a substantial pre-project database allowed for reasonable working decisions when the project was undertaken. Costs for the project were about $9,500 per acre. 107.

After outlining the relationship between restoration and mitigation banking (a legal mechanism used to obtain habitat compensation for losses to existing wetlands under Section 10 and Section 404), the author provides examples drawn from eight such banks. For the most part the relationship has had mixed success. Project monitoring and evaluation appear absolutely necessary in order to achieve restoration/creation goals. 108. The controversy over wetlands. Wendy L. Melgin. 1989. Water Science and Technology Newsletter. (6)2. The author suggests that evidence for successful wetland restoration or creation remains scarce and expresses her concern over a complacent attitude in this new era of "no net loss of the nation's remaining wetlands." She calls for increased emphasis on understanding wetland hydrology as the key element in wet- land restoration and management. In conclusion she emphasizes the need for clearly defined criteria for wetland restoration. 109. Wetland restoration at the South Beltline: Can humans create natural ecosystems? Catherine Owen. 1989. Our Wetlands. (12)2:2-3. Emphasizes the importance of hydrology as the controlling factor in the success or failure in wetland restoration. Hydrologie problems can result from improper stratigraphy anchor grade. Another hydrological problem source is the routing of stormwater drains directly into the restored wetland. The author also reports mixed success in transplanting salvaged marsh sod. Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="12">93 Lakes, Rivers and Streams 110. Adopting A Stream: A Northwest Handbook. 1989. Steve Yates. University of Washington Press. P. O. Box 50096, Seattle, WA 98145; 144 pp.; $9.95 (paper). Upon noting the title of this book, many readers, like car shoppers guarding against a sales pitch, may doubt they will be swayed. Curious, but skeptical, they wander into the pages. Many enter predisposed to seeing single aspects of streams - shade, cool- ness, waterfalls, fish, unusual birds or mammals. But the author, Steve Yates, soon convinces us that there are many water- world "secrets" available even to casual observers. His purpose is to reveal these "secrets," illustrate them in landscapes upon which human beings have had profound influence, and give instruction and encouragement for the healing of streams. Despite the title, this book is applicable to any part of the country in which streams suffer damage. Its opening pages contain a thorough, yet simple, explanation of scientific terms used to describe a stream's physical and chemical character, i.e., pH, DO, clarity, salinity. Subsequent sections, using Northwest species as examples, describe the web of organisms that occupy streams - fish, insects, detritivores, amphibians, birds, and mammals. This is a look at the water world from headwater creeks to larger streams and rivers. In a broader view, streams are depicted as an essential link between everything and everyone living in the same water- shed. With many common examples, Yates dispels notions of "the other guy" being responsible for damage to watersheds; it is clear the enemy is "us." The first half of the book is a good introduction towards an understanding and appreciation of streams, and also leads to a sense of regret at the damage done to them. This sense of loss is an excellent preparation for the final chapters in which Yates describes, step by step, how to become a stream "parent." This is the inspiration that ac- complishes the book's purpose. Real- world ex- amples of streams healed through adoption by schools and communities, make it clear that seem- ingly small steps - one stream at a time - really can solve large problems. The heroes here are ordinary people literally getting their feet wet - not merely watching, but actually performing restoration. These are teachers and students, sportsfishing clubs and homeowners, recreational and community groups working with little money to rehabilitate streams through monitoring water quality, revegetating and fencing streambanks, stopping pol- lution, and so on. Those who, in the book's initial pages, had no idea of dabbling in the water world, will be hard pressed to ignore the potential of what might be accomplished by their initiative. Adopting A Stream serves as an excellent handbook for us, all of us, to begin. Cat Hawkins 600 East Park Avenue Port Angeles, WA 98362 111. Down by the River: The Impact of Federal Water Projects and Policies on Biological Diversity. 1988. Constance Elizabeth Hunt with Verne Huser. Island Press, Washington, D.C. Published in cooperation with The National Wildlife Federation. 260 pp. $34.95, cloth; $22.95, paper. Riparian ecosystems as defined by Ms. Hunt lie within the 100- year floodplain and are dependent on periodic flooding. They are remarkably produc- tive and valuable ecologically. In the lower forty- eight states less than one-fifth of previous riparian ecosystems remain in a natural or semi-natural con- dition. That the loss of these systems has been due largely to United States government policies on water resources and federal support for water-re- lated projects is a major theme of this new book. In this non-technical, but well documented book, Ms. Hunt provides detailed histories of eight rivers where federally sanctioned projects destroyed or impaired rich, healthy riparian ecosystems. While each history is unique, the overall theme remains the same: attempts to tame and exploit rivers and floodplains - sometimes for noble causes (and usually with tax dollars) - have resulted in dramatic declines in biological diversity. Ms. Hunt emphasizes the need to halt future destruction and to restore some of what has been needlessly lost. A few restoration attempts are brief- ly described as possible examples of what might be done. Noting that many destructive projects have been modified or stopped due to the enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, Ms. Hunt advocates more broad-based legislation which would encom- pass whole ecosystems. Such an Endangered Ecosystems Act is a concept SER members should promote. Restorationists will find Down by the River help- ful in placing their work in the context of history, politics, economics and law. Furthermore, it's heartwarming to read a muckraker willing to advo- cate ecological restoration as part of the remedy.

Fisheries habitat and channel stability in the restoration of Black- wood Creek. Jeffery Reiner. USDA Forest Service, Lake Tahoe. A gravel operation changed the character of a migratory fishery in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Forest Service installed large log and boulder structures to affect the stream's character for fish breeding and rearing areas. Native grasses, trees and shrubs were reestablished on the streambanks to control erosion and provide cover. 1 12.4. Dangers of overstabilization in streams and riparian restoration. Ray J. White.

The Gorgas Valley is an 1 ,800-acre forested urban park in Philadelphia. In 1986 a plan for its recovery was begun with the goal of reestablishing the native plant communities. Current research deals with watershed hydrology, forest restoration on steep slopes, the historic flora at the site, and an inventory of existing plant species. 1 13.

Eight emergent aquatic species and nine planting mixes were planted to control erosion along the shoreline and embankment of a man-made lake. Emergent vegetation was found difficult to establish. Meanwhile, seed mixes did become established but the resulting vegetation could not halt shoreline erosion. Soil layering and geo-textile filters were found more effective. 113.2.

Kathryn McEachern, Julie A. Magnuson, Noel B. Pavolic. An intensive study into the population biology and habitat relations of Cirsium pitcheri begun in 1988 at Indiana Dunes, Sleeping Bear and Painted Rocks National Lakeshores revealed that this Federally threatened species requires open, wind-blown areas adjacent to existing populations in order to maintain itself. 1 17.3. Factors affecting regional diversity of Great Lakes marshes in Michigan. Dennis A. Albert, Michael R. Penskar, Gary A. Reese, William W. Brodowicz, Lawrence Brewer, Elaine M. Chittenden, and Ursula C. Petersen. The inventory team sampled vegetation, substrate and water depth along transects in 58 marshes bordering the shores of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, St. Clair, and Erie during the sum- mers of 1987 and 1988. Regional patterns in marsh zonation (swamp forest, shrub swamp, sedge/grass meadow, emergent marsh, submergent marsh) and species composition were found to be most strongly affected by latitude and bedrock differences, while shoreline configuration and substrate differences ac- counted for local variations. 1 17.4. Environmental factors influencing vegetal composition of south- western Michigan coastal marshes. Gary A. Reese, William W. Brodowicz, and Dennis A. Albert. The coastal marshes associated with seven southwestern Michigan river systems were sampled. Their vegetal composition was found to best correlate with gradient type and substrate depth. These factors provided a better predictor of composition than water depth alone. Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="14">95 1 1 8.

This report of a six-year monitoring effort following highway construction through a black rush marsh found that reestablish- ment of preconstruction contours were critical to successful revegetation. It was also found that selective removal of "donor plants" from a nearby marsh did not appear to adversely affect that area's plant populations. 1 19.

Gail Newton, Gail Newton and Associates, Areata, CA 95521 currently with California Division of Mines and Geology, Mine Reclamation Program, 650 B Bereut Drive, Sacramento, CA 958 14. An account of revegetation work on a coastal dune using two seven-species seed mixes, and by vegetative propagation, using five other local ecotypes. When properly mixed and applied, seed mixes proved more economical and yielded a more diverse com- munity. Stabilization aspects of the design included sand fencing, straw bale fencing, straw punching, and soil stabilizing emulsion. The soil stabilizing emulsion (Soil Seal) had no effect on vegeta- tive propagules but reduced the cover, density and height of seeded species when compared to the straw punch areas. The straw punch areas, however, had more weedy species. 120. Salt marsh harvest mice, urban development, and rising sea levels. 1989. Howard S.

Shellhammer questions the F&amp;WS Recovery Plan for the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse because it lacks strategies for responding to water level changes in tidal marshes due to the greenhouse effect. He also discusses the impact of rising land values, wondering whether mitigation efforts will be enough to save the species sind ultimately suggests that the solution may lie in the construction and management of large diked salt marshes. 12 1 .

Revegetation Patterns in Mined Peatlands in Central and Eastern North America Studied. Norman C. Famous and Marcia Spencer, Down East Peat L.P. Box 45D Lane Road, Deblois, ME 04622, (207) 638-2032; and Harold D. Nilsson, Environ- mental Consultant Services, R.F.D. #1, Box 61, Etna, ME 04434 Down East Peat L.P. is studying natural revegetation patterns in mined peatlands in the United States and Canada. The results of these investigations will be used to help develop a reclamation plan for Denbo Heath, a 450-hectare bog being mined to fuel North America's first peat-fired power plant (22.8 megawatt) located in Deblois, Maine. Abandoned peatlands were visited in Minnesota, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, and Newfoundland, with detailed studies being conducted in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Maine. Most of the Canadian and Maine peatlands were raised, ombrotrophic (rainwater only) bogs composed of nutrient-defi- cient, poorly humified (1-4 von Post scale) peat. All of the peatlands contained drainage ditches, and the original surface vegetation had either been removed or highly disturbed. The age since abandonment ranges between 4 and 92 years. The mining methods include dredging, bucket extraction, hand and machine cutting, bulldozing, and vacuum mining. Sites abandoned prior to 1970 were mined either by dredging, bucket extraction, hand cutting, or machine cutting. These methods disturbed only a portion of the surface at any one time. The present surfaces of these sites are characterized by wet basins (one to three meters deep) alternating with dry raised ridges. Revegetation is generally com- plete, and the reclaiming plant species are typically bog and fen ericaceous shrubs including sheep laurel ( Kalmia angusti/olia), bog laurel (K. polifolia ), Labrador tea ( Ledum groenlandicum ), leatherleaf (Chamaedaphnae calyculata ), dwarf blueberry ( Vaccinium angusti/olia ), and rhodora {Rhododendron canadense). Trees, including black spruce ( Picea mariana), white birch Betula papyifera) and larch (La rix laricina) colonized the well-drained raised surfaces while Sphagnum mos- ses and ericaceous shrubs colonized the poorly drained excavated areas. Traditional Sphagnum mounding developed on the older sites, some ap- pearing indistinguishable from unmined sections. (Farnham Bog near Montreal, Quebec, is an ex- ample.) Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="15">96 In contrast, sites abandoned in the 1970s and 1980s were mined using the vacuuming method, which left large denuded areas to revegetate. Revegetation ranged from poor (less than 5 percent cover) to nearly complete on the oldest site. The large open expanses of raw peat that were left to reclaim are subject to wind and water erosion, frost heaving, and surface crusting, and tend to revegetate slowly. The most complete revegetation occurs on minerotrophic fens and sites mined to the subpeat mineral layer. Sites that were either limed or fertil- ized revegetated within five years. Extremely dry and extremely wet ombrotrophic sites were the slowest to revegetate. Complete revegetation may take decades. Cotton grass ( Eriophorum spissum) and white birch were the first species to recolonize, followed by ericaceous shrubs and black crowberry ( Empetrum nigrum). Sphagnum mosses were rare on these sites. (Examples are Riviere du Loup Bog in Quebec and Jonesport Bog in Maine.) Percent cover by species was estimated for each of four strata of vegetation in over 300 relevé plots (5 meter by 5 meter) established in 12 abandoned peatlands. These data are being analyzed using detrended correspondence analysis. Detailed studies on the relationship between water table depth and percent cover of all species are being conducted. Readers with information on abandoned peat mining operations are asked to contact the authors. 124. Reintroduction of Bobcats to Cumberland Is- land National Seashore (Georgia) R. J. Warren, M. J. Conroy, L. A. Baker, D. R. Diefenbach, and W. E. James, School of Forest Resources, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 (404) 542-6474 A complex project designed to reintroduce a na- tive mammalian predator to an eastern U.S. barrier island was begun in 1988 with two principal inves- tigators and three wildlife graduate students. The project's management goal was to re-establish a self- reproducing population of bobcats (Felis rufiis) on Cumberland Island. Research objectives were to determine: 1) the seasonal food habits of reintroduced bobcats, 2) their seasonal movements and habitat use, and 3) their survival, reproduction, and population over a three-year period following release. Two of the three project years were funded by the University of Georgia, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Georgia Game and Fish Division; funding for the third year is still needed. After extensive public review and comment on an Environmental Assessment for the project, ap- proval was obtained to reintroduce bobcats on Cum- berland Island National Seashore in August 1988. Wild bobcats were live-trapped from coastal Geor- gia and quarantined in a holding facility, vaccinated, and fitted with radio-telemetry collars prior to release. They were released on the island in groups of 4-6 each to create a known increase in the bobcat population, which provided an opportunity to evaluate the scent-station survey method of estimat- ing bobcat population abundance. Fourteen adult bobcats (11 females and three males) were released in the Fall of 1988. One female was killed, possibly by a feral hog ( Sus scrofa ), in January 1989, and one female swam back to the mainland in February 1989. As of June 1989, five bobcat litters have been located and at least 12 kittens counted. Bobcat movements have been highly variable; one female travelled the full length of the 28-km long island at least twice, giving her an estimated home range size as great as 106 km2. Scat analyses conducted to date have revealed the three most important prey items for the reintroduced bobcats are (in decreasing order): marsh rabbits ( Sylvilagus palustris), white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ), and feral hogs. Work planned for the second and third years of the project include: 1) trapping and radio-collaring kittens to monitor their survival and dispersal in 1989 and 1990, 2) to capture and release 16 addi- tional adult bobcats on the island during the Fall of 1989, 3) continued monitoring of bobcat food habits, movements, and survival, and 4) continued evaluation of the scent-station index to determine bobcat abundance as populations increase. 125.

This research details the disappearance and re-establishment of Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha , one of the two parrot species native to the continental United States. Both wild-caught adults, which had been confiscated from smugglers, and captive-bred birds were released in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona. The wild birds, while more migratory than the re- searchers had hoped, have survived quite well. By contrast, results with captive-bred parrots in the wild have been poor. An experiment with one parrot that had been bred in captivity but raised by wild parrots suggests that feeding ability and other necessary behavior can be learned for survival in the wild. 130.

Johnson, School of Environmental Design and U.S. National Park Service Cooperative Studies Unit, Institute of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 (404) 542-5851 The exposed rock outcrops of Craggy Pinnacle in the Blue Ridge Parkway are an important habitat for five rare and endangered plant species, Geum radiatum , Jurvcus trifidus var. carolinianus , Lycopodium selago , Scirpus cespitosa and Ca rex misera. The rare plants are found exclusively on exposed rock outcrops and, where they occur, al- most always comprise the majority of vascular plant species. In recent years, however, visitors have trampled the outcrop vegetation, destroying in- dividual rare plants and fragmentating the habitat. In conjunction with a management program to curtail visitor use of the outcrops, restoration of the rare plant habitat is being attempted using a com- bined strategy of microhabitat assessment, propaga- tion and reintroduction. The goal is to restore the rock outcrop flora, as closely as possible, to its pre-disturbance condition. Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="17">98 To recreate a self-sustaining community it is necessary to determine an appropriate species com- position for each site, along with any community dynamics that may be essential for continued sur- vival. To this end a microhabitat assessment is being conducted to study the relationship between the species composition and physiographic characteris- tics of relatively undamaged sites. Multivariate analysis will be performed to determine the most important habitat characteristics for each species and to predict the natural species composition and densities that would be expected on a given site. The goals are to develop a habitat model that estimates an appropriate density at which to plant each species relative to available microhabitats on the rocks, and to create a simplified typology of habitats and their suitability for each species. Data are being collected for sixteen habitat at- tributes, including elevation, soil depth, habitat, size and shape, soil moisture, solar orientation and slope of the general habitat and the microhabitat, drainage slope of the microhabitat, and the percent overhead canopy and percent lateral canopy of adjacent shrubs and trees. Three indices describing moisture collection are being used to indicate the relative amounts of direct precipitation, direct runoff from rocks and delayed runoff (which maintains saturated conditions on some sites) that each plot receives. One nominal variable, describing whether the habitat consists of a ledge or a crack in the rock is also included. In addition, analysis of soils, soil arthropods, the rock substrate and nutrient throughflow in rain and runoff will provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the rare plant community. An hypothesis that mosses, which cover the surface at most of the rare plant sites, play an essential role in rare plant survival will be examined. Mosses may act as a living mulch to stabilize soils, enhance moisture retention and protect plant crowns from extreme heat. They may also play a role in nutrient release by producing flushes of growth and dieback followed by decomposition by soil organisms. Data was collected during the summer of 1988 and is being analyzed in preparation for a more detailed study in summer 1989. Initial results indi- cate a very strong correlation between microhabitat characteristics and percent cover of individual species, indicating strong adaptation to specific microhabitats. With the exception of Geum radiatum , there is no record of any propagation of these species. Propagation is currently being attempted by seed, gemmae (L. selago ), crown division and tissue cul- ture. Four separate propagators are working with the seeds, and are testing various seed stratification methods, planting media, etc. Initial attempts have been largely successful and will provide plants for both a "dry run" in summer 1989 and a major effort in 1990. We will also attempt different methods to quickly establish moss cover on exposed soil. The current condition of the rare plant habitat ranges from relatively untrammeled to completely devegetated areas where evidence indicates that healthy habitat with up to a foot of soil has recently been eroded to bare rock. For the least damaged sites, removal of trampling pressure may be enough to facilitate recovery. For other sites, habitat reconstruction will be necessary. In areas that have suffered complete soil removal, we will introduce soil from areas adjacent to the rock outcrops, attempt to stabilize it with biodegradable fabric and metal pins, introduce plants and seeds, and attempt to reestablish the moss cover that characterizes most of the study sites. Reestablishment trials will be con- ducted in summer 1989 to test timing and methods of planting, the appropriate species selection for different types of sites, and methods of soil reintroduction and stabilization. The plant of greatest concern is Geum radiatum , currently proposed for federal listing. In recent years, it appears that G. radiatum populations have declined at other sites, increasing concern for its survival. As well as attempting to restore any damaged geum habitat, we will attempt to introduce it on nearby tunnel cuts, sites which were created during the construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway, and whose sheer rock cliffs would appear to provide excellent habitat for this species. Similar rare plant habitat at other popular sites in the Blue Ridge and Appalachian Mountains has suffered damage like that at Craggy Pinnacle. The experience gained at Craggy Pinnacle, both in terms of visitor management and rare plant restoration, may be helpful in developing a generalized methodology for management of these fragile habitats. 132. Micropropagation Of Freshwater Plants (Florida) Dr. Michael E. Kane, Ornamental Horticulture Department, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 (904)392-7937 Micropropagation is the rapid vegetative propagation of plants cultured on a defined growing medium in sterile culture vessels (in vitro) in con- trolled temperature and light conditions. Micropropagation is used extensively for the com- mercial propagation of many horticultural crops, but little information is available on the applicability of this technique for production of native herbaceous freshwater plants used for aquatic and wetland revegetation. Aquatic and wetland plant micropropagation could provide a method for native plant nurseries to produce vigorous and highly branched plants in less time and space than is now Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="18">99 possible using traditional propagation methods. Micropropagation of under-utilized species that are slow growing or difficult to propagate by conven- tional methods would increase the variety of plants available for restoration projects. Most importantly, this technique would decrease both the need for and associated negative impact from the collection of large numbers of plants from donor wetlands. Results of studies in our laboratory clearly indi- cate that aquatic species can be multiplied rapidly when cultured in vitro. We have successfully estab- lished eight amphibious species of the watermilfoil family (Haloragaceae) in vitro including five species of Myriophyllum (M humile , M. heterophyllum , M. pinnatum , M aquaticum , M tenellum) and three species of Proserpinaca ( P palustris, P. intermedia , and P pectinata). All species were established in vitro by surface sterilizing defoliated nodal stem segments in aqueous sodium hypochlorite (20 per- cent Clorox™ bleach) followed by three five-minute rinses in sterile deionized water. Stem segments were cultured in a sterile liquid medium consisting of half-strength Linsmaier and Skoog mineral salts and organics supplemented with 30 g/1 sucrose (pH 5.7). Addition of the plant growth regulator 2- isopentenyladenine (2iP) or zeatin greatly enhanced shoot multiplication from lateral buds in most Myriophyllum species. For example, a 20-fold in- crease in shoot number was observed when a single node propagule of M. aquaticum was cultured in the presence of 1 .0 mg/1 2iP for 14 days. Aquatic plants can also be regenerated adven- titiously from tissues not possessing pre-formed buds. In M. heterophyllum more than 2,600 adven- titious shoots were produced from a single leaf cul- tured for 28 days! Transplant survival of most species produced in vitro usually exceeded 90 per- cent in the greenhouse. We are now developing procedures for the micropropagation of herbaceous marginal aquatic species including Pontedaria cordata , Spartina spp., Orontium aquaticum , and Sagittaria spp. We also plan to evaluate the post-transplant field sur- vival and growth performance of these in vitro propagated species.

Micropropagation of Native Woody Plants (Florida) Dr. Michael Kane, Ornamental Horticulture Depart- ment, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 3261 1 (904) 392-7937 Micropropagation (tissue culture propagation) is widely used for the commercial vegetative propaga- tion of many horticultural crops. Micropropagated plants are usually more vigorous-growing, highly- branched, and often earlier-flowering than plants propagated by other asexual methods. Conceivably, this may be true of native woody plants as well, resulting in plants with superior performance capabilities for restoration work. However, the ap- plicability of this technique for production of native woody species used in revegetation projects is lar- gely unknown. Micropropagation protocols for black túpelo ( Nyssa sylvatica) and mock-orange (Styrax americana) were recently developed. For Nyssa, maximal shoot multiplication (9 shoots/nodal seg- ments-week culture cycle) occurred from surface- sterilized nodal stem segments cultured on either Murashige &amp; Skoog or Woody Plant Medium [WPM] supplemented with 1.0 mg/1 N6-ben- zyladenine [BA], a plant growth regulator. In Styrax , maximum shoot multiplication (14 shoots/nodal segment/7-week culture cycle) from nodal stem segments occurred on WPM supple- mented with 1.0 mg/1 BA. Regenerated shoots of Nyssa were effectively rooted (96 percent) in plug trays containing Vergro soilless potting medium. However, 100 percent rooting was achieved following pre-dipping the basal end of each shoot in 100 mg/1 indolebutyric acid [IBA]. Rooted Nyssa shoots were acclimatized to greenhouse conditions with 100 percent transplant survival. Within 10 months following transplanting into one-gallon containers, plants were highly branched and had attained shoot lengths exceeding 1.3 m. Maximum rooting (74 percent) of Styrax shoots was observed when shoots were cul- tured on WPM supplemented with 1.0 mg/1 IBA. Subsequent transplant survival of rooted Styrax shoots in Vergro was 83 percent. These results indi- cate that vigorous plants of these species can be produced rapidly and in large numbers by micropropagation. Reference Kane, M. E., T. J. Sheehan, B. Dehgan, and N. Philman. 1988.

Seagrass Micro-Propagation: A Step Closer to Restoration with "In Vitro" Plants (Florida) Evamaria W. Koch and Michael J. Durako, Rorida Marine Research Institute, 100 Eighth Ave., S.E., St. Petersburg, FL 33701 (813) 896-8626 In vitro micropropagation of submerged fresh- water macrophytes under controlled, bacteria-free conditions has proven valuable to aquatic scientists because it provides clonal material for physiological and toxicological research. This method of propagation may also supply resource managers Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="19">100 with plants for restoration projects, minimizing or alleviating the need to disturb and potentially damage donor bed sites. Consequently, there is increasing interest in applying micropropagation techniques to seagrasses. We have been able to propagate bacteria-free Widgeon grass ( Ruppia maritima) in vitro by sterilizing individual field-collected nodal segments with a combination of fungicide (Captan™), surgace disinfectant (Clorox™), and antibiotic (erythromycin and rifampin) treatments. Highest growth rates are attained using half- strength Murashige and Skoog salt base in 15-ppt synthetic seawater (Instant Ocean™) at pH 5.6. The addition of sucrose (1-3 percent) to the media also enhances growth, with up to 24 nodes being produced ex- ponentially from the original segments in 60 days. Additions of plant growth regulators to the cul- ture media result in morphological differentiation of growing segments. High cytokinin (kinetin and 2iP) to auxin (NAA) ratios increase branching; in media with high concentrations of 2iP (20 mg^l), a "witch's broom" type of growth (large numbers of very short branches with small blades) occurs. However, the resulting short internodes make subdividing for propagation difficult. Adding the synthetic cytokinin thidiazuron (DROPP™) to the media causes intemodal elongation. The correct combina- tion of 2iP and thidiazuron may produce plants that are readily propagated in vitro and may provide suitable material for future transplantation into the field. 135.

This researcher studied various seed treatments, tillage schemes, and watering arrangements to determine the cultural requirements of the species.

A. Dobberteen, Ethan Perry, Norton H. Nick- erson, Department of Biology, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155 (617) 381-3195 Purple loosestrife ( Lythrum salicaria) has be- come a significant threat to wetland ecosystems since its introduction to North America in the early 1800s. An invasive growth habit allow it to rapidly dominate wetland areas and consequently lower their productivity, diversity, and wildlife habitat value. Current methods to control purple loosestrife - herbicides, manual removal, and in- duced competition with other plants - are either en- vironmentally dangerous or intensive in terms of labor and/or money. During our literature review it was noted that others had successfully used clear plastic to eliminate the common reed ( Phragmites australis) from wetland areas (Boone et al., 1988). We, there- fore, hypothesized that clear plastic and its as- sociated high temperatures would retard the growth of purple loosestrife at a freshwater marsh in north- eastern Massachusetts. To test this idea three repli- cate areas were established, each with a control and an experimental plot (1 m x 1 m). Before the ex- perimental plots were covered with 4-mil clear plas- tic, all the purple loosestrife stems were counted and then cut. Control plots were left uncovered. After two weeks the plastic-covered plots had 6-38 percent fewer purple loosestrife stems. Sur- face temperatures in the experimental plots were 3-12 degrees Celsius higher than those in the control Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="20">101 plots. Subsurface temperatures were also somewhat higher. These results indicate that further large-scale ex- periments are warranted. Such research will inves- tigate 1) whether or not larger areas under plastic will result in higher temperatures, 2) the effects of a second cutting, and 3) the time necessary for treat- ment. This research will help to develop and refine non- chemical strategies to control invasive plants like purple loosestrife. Reference Boone, Jim; Elaine Furbish; Kent Turner; and Susan Bratton. 1988.

Dobberteen, Lelito Environmental Consultants, P. O. Box 277, Sagamore Beach, MA 02562, 508/833- 0404 and Department of Biology, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155 Wetland restoration strategies attempt to restore previously degraded areas to their original condi- tion. However, such wetlands are often invaded by disturbed soil colonizers, such as the common reed ( Phragmites australis) and purple loosestrife (Ly thrum salicaria). Therefore, a secondary goal of restoration programs is to control invasive plants associated with degraded ecosystems. As part of a wetland restoration project in north- eastern Massachusetts, efforts were directed towards controlling and hopefully eliminating purple loosestrife on the site. The wetland area (17 m X 50 m) had been denuded of topsoil and vegeta- tion. What remained was a seasonally flooded depression covered by a monotypie stand of purple loosestrife. While removing plants before re vegetating would have resulted in short- term con- trol, purple loosestrife propagules in the seed bank would have constituted a long-term threat. There- fore, the restoration strategy was directed towards establishing conditions that discourage growth of purple loosestrife. To achieve this goal, a basin was excavated in the Spring of 1989. Original soils, which had been mounded nearby, were reintroduced into the area. An aggressive planting program was then imple- mented, using sweetflag (Acorus calamus ), burreed (Sparganium eurycarpum ), pickerel plant (Pon- te de ria cordata ), blue flag (Ms versicolor ), and arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia ) obtained from com- mercial nurseries. In addition, floating mats of hay with narrowleaved cattail (Typha angusti/olia) were established using a newly developed technique. Through this restoration strategy, a ponded area was created with average depths of approximately 1 m; sufficiently deep to greatly retard germination of purple loosestrife. Furthermore, banks were revegetated with either the emergent perennial species listed above or with native grass, sedge and rush seed. This ground cover should competitively exclude purple loosestrife from most of the area. Monitoring and maintenance activities will be con- ducted for at least two years and will include hand- removal of purple loosestrife and necessary replanting. Results from this research will be reported in a forthcoming issue. We anticipate that hands-on restoration experience, using techniques described above, will enhance our abilities as wet- land scientists and managers to exclude invasive and exotic plants from restored wetlands. 141. Plant Community on San Clemente Island Responds to Control of Feral Goats and Pigs (California) R. Mitchel Beauchamp, Pacific Southwest Biologi- cal Services, Inc., P. O. Box 985, National City, CA 92050 (619) 477-5333 Restoration of vegetation on San demente Is- land has recently become possible following major reductions in the island's feral goat and pig popula- tions. This effort has been a long-range concern of the U.S. Navy, which administers the 145,000-ha island. Over the past 30 years, several methods have been used to decrease feral herbivore populations. While complete extirpation has not yet been achieved, these techniques have produced a decline in the number of feral goats and pigs. As of summer 1989 the goat population is estimated to be 200, with a slightly higher number of pigs. Removing most of the feral herbivores has produced a marked response in the native flora. Perhaps the most impressive change has been the increase in the standing grass crop during the sum- mer. For instance, purple needlegrass (Stipa pulchra ), which had previously existed only in short clumps prior to the feral reductions, is now flourish- ing in ftill stature and abundance. Cacti, notably Opuntia prolifera and O. littoralis , are a major constituent of slope vegetation on the island. However, with reduced grazing, grasses are expected to offer these cacti increased competition. It is expected that, in time, a more "natural" balance - fewer cacti, more grasses - will be ob- tained. A further consequence of reduced grazing has been the emergence of both unknown, or extremely uncommon, annual and perennial seedlings from the seedbank. Likewise, several island endemics that were believed extinct have reappeared. Other active restoration activities include out- planting selected trees and shrubs in order to help speed the establishment of vegetative groundcover. The increased canopy from these plantings is ex- pected to collect moisture from the heavy maritime Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="21">102 fog, and then dispense the precipitation onto the groundlayer. The removal of the feral animal populations will have to be completed, however, before the restora- tion of the San Gemente Island's grasslands and shrublands is certain. Even then a strict manage- ment policy of controlled burning will be required to keep these communities intact. 142. Exotic Plant Vandal on California Coast Vic Hendrix, Volunteer - Habitat Restoration Team, 1040 Folsom #16, San Francisco, CA 94103 (415)431-5689 A vigilant park service maintenance worker has organized a volunteer crew to undo the work of a vandal who, for the past 1 1 years, has been planting Arctotheca calendula (South African capeweed) throughout an 80-km stretch of public lands from San Francisco's Golden Gate Park to Point Reyes National Seashore. This hearty, alien groundcover spreads by runners and adapts to heavy traffic by hikers, horses and mountain bikes by growing tighter and closer to the ground. The perpetrator of these plantings has been iden- tified, and surveillance has documented his planting habits and led to discovery of a "garden" in which he grows aliens for his plantings. These include artichoke thistle, narcissus and water hyacinth in addition to South African capeweed. National Park Service officials, however, seem unmoved by the threat of this activity, and have been slow to deter- mine what constitutes evidence of vandalism. The vandal's targeting of public lands appears to stem from a strong resentment towards the government, possibly due to past tax problems. Whatever his motive, the effects of his behavior will take hundreds of thousands of hours to correct. Gary Mott, the Park Service worker, deserves commendation for his valiant efforts in the face of tough odds and apparent bureaucratic indifference. 143.

Diversity of Planted and Colonizing Species, Relationship Explored Michael Palmer, North Carolina Botanical Garden, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, CB# 3375, Totten Center, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3375 (919)286-4861 Enhancing species richness is often a goal of ecological restoration. However, ecological theory offers conflicting advice about achieving richness. One view holds that "diversity breeds diversity" - the idea being that planting many species creates numerous distinct microsites, thus encouraging various species to colonize. On the other hand, it is also possible that the number of species that can fit in a community is limited. To the extent this is true, planting many species might well reduce the number of colonizing species. With this uncertainty in mind, I initiated a pilot project using agricultural crops and weeds at Mason Farm (a preserve operated by the University of North Carolina) to determine whether initial species richness encourages or discourages colonizing species richness. In September, 1988 1 planted oats, lettuce, parsley, kale, alfalfa, crimson clover, spinach, and beets in mixtures of one, two, four and eight species in 2 m x 2 m plots. In December 1988, I recorded the presence of each weed species in each plot. There were no significant relationships be- tween crop richness and weed richness in a plot. Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="22">103 However, there was a negative relationship between the number of weed species per square decimeter and the number of crop species planted. This im- plies that initial richness does tend to reduce colonist richness, at least on a very small scale. While this may suggest appropriate applications in natural community restorations, one should remember that agricultural systems are quite different systems; being easier to control and study. In the future, I plan to study the effects of grass species richness on colonizing forb and woody species richness in restored Oklahoma tallgrass prairies. I also hope to investigate whether planting a diverse selection of fast-growing trees is an effec- tive strategy for establishing a diverse tropical forest on abandoned cattle pastures in Costa Rica. 146. Interpretive Signs Increase Effectiveness of Brush-Pile Barriers (North Carolina) Bart R. Johnson, School of Environmental Design and U.S. National Park Service Cooperative Studies Unit, Institute of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 (404)542-5851. In the summer of 1987, a network of un- authorized trails on Craggy Pinnacle in the Blue Ridge Parkway was intentionally blocked with heavy brush in order to protect fragile plant habitat (R&amp;MN 6(2): 130). To determine the effectiveness of the brushings, a monitoring system was imple- mented that included measurements of height, width, depth, and effectiveness as a physical barrier and visual screen. A review of the situation deter- mined that in large part these brushings failed to deter undesirable trail use. When researchers chose to repeat the experiment in the summer of 1988 they knew that something more was necessary. There- fore, after they had rebuilt the original 1 1 brushings as closely as possible to their initial ratings and dimensions they added signs reading "Fragile Habitat - Area Closed." The results of comparisons between the two years show that the signs reduced damage to brushings dramatically. Without signs, in 1987, four of 11 brushings were completely destroyed within one month and three others were rendered ineffective. Overall, brushings lost an average of 54 percent of their height in this period during 1987. After the same period in 1988, all brushings were intact. In 1987, after two months, six brushings were destroyed and another four were rendered ineffec- tive with an average 77 percent loss in height. After two months, in 1988, only one brushing had been damaged enough to rate it ineffective and overall height reduction averaged only 23 percent. To better test the effectiveness of brushing with signs, monitoring was conducted for a longer period in 1988, including six weeks before and six weeks after the dates of the 1987 experiment. The last three weeks of this period encompass the fall color season, the time of highest site visitation. After 19 weeks in 1988, only three brushings had become ineffective. Meanwhile, three remained undamaged, losing an average of 35 percent of their height. While brushings with sign did not completely stop the use of unofficial trails, they remained effec- tive as a deterrent throughout the 1988 visitor season, in direct contrast to the rapid destruction of brushings without signs the previous year. The results demonstrate that interpretation of fragile habitat can be an important component of protection from visitor impacts. References Johnson, Bart. In Press.

Development of a Front-End TVactor Reaper David Mahler, Environmental Survey Consult- ing, 4602 Placid Place, Austin, Texas 78731 (512) 458-8531 Environmental Survey Consulting has developed a new harvesting machine, the front-end tractor reaper, for the bulk harvest of seed growing in areas too rough for a combine, but accessible to a tractor. In the central Texas hill country, for example, it can be used to wind between trees on the relatively level topographic benches. This reaper consists of a box 2.29 m wide, 76 cm high and 1.52 m deep (7.5' x 2.5' x 5') which is mounted on the loader arms of a tractor, replacing the loader bucket. A cutting bar from a sickle-bar mower is mounted on the bottom front of the box, and a rotary set of four paddles is mounted on the top front. The cutting bar and rotary paddles are powered by separate hydraulic motors mounted on the box. A hydraulic pump, with a 55-gallon (210 1) reservoir is mounted at the rear and driven by the rear power take-off shaft. Hoses with variable flow control valves connect the pump to the hydraulic motors, allowing the operator to control the speed of the cutting bar and paddles separately. The height and pitch of the box can be constantly adjusted to lift it over rocks, stumps or patches of undesirable species. When the box is full, it is unloaded by tilting the box back and releasing a trap door at the rear. While the cut material might be compared to seed hay, this device operates in habitat too rough for haying and also collects all the material cut without the large loss of seed that occurs in cutting, raking and baling hay. The front-end tractor reaper complements the Grin Reaper, a box and bag attachment to a string line trimmer, developed in 1985 by Environmental Survey Consulting ( R&amp;MN 6(1):23, 25).

These harvesting tools offer methods inter- mediate between hand harvesting (which is suitable for any terrain and offers a high degree of selectivity, but is very time consuming) and combine harvesting (which is very efficient, but is extremely restricted in acceptable field conditions and has little selec- tivity). Environmental Survey Consulting is successful- ly utilizing seed gathered with these two devices on a number of restoration and restoration/landscaping projects. 148.

D'Antonio, Dept. of Biological Sciences, UC-Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106; and Ann M. Howald. A pipeline construction area gave researchers a chance to assess three different revegetation techniques. Topsoil conserva- tion was found to play an important role in species regeneration; hydroseeding was effective only for a few species. Pine brush incineration increased the growth and abundance of two native shrubs and when heat was sufficient it increased pine regenera- tion. 148.2. Experimental attempts at revegetation of an eroded coastal ter- race on Santa Barbara Island, California. Carla D'Antonio, Dept. of Biological Sciences, UC-Santa Barbara, Santa Bar- bara, CA 93 106. Following years of disturbance, some areas of Santa Barbara Island are barren, highly saline terraces which have not been vegetated in forty years. By tilling the soil, then planting it and covering the area with a straw/coconut fiber blanket an ex- perimental plot was successfully revegetated. California sea- blite ( Suaeda californica ) was the most successful colonizer. 148.3. Air-earth interface model for ecosystem restoration and main- tenance. Robert M. Dixon. The air-earth interface model (AEI) describes the interaction between the immediate soil surface and the different processes which operate on it - desertification, infiltration, imprintation, and revegetation. The model details the positive role land imprint- ing and revegetation play by increasing infiltration and thereby curbing desertification. 148.4. The Soleduck Road project: Revegetating cut slopes with locally collected native transplants. Nancy Dunkle, Kirsten Krueger, Robin Reid, Richard Ellison, Ben Alexander, and Kathleen Wilson. Over 40,000 native ferns, shrubs, and trees were transplanted along 12 miles of highly visible cut slopes in Olympia National Park. With only one exception, survival has been very high for both spring- and fall-transplanted stock. 148.5. The effect of mycorrhizal fungi and plant density on belowground interactions between plants. Raymond L. Fran- son, USD A- ARS Wes. Reg. Res. Cen., Albany, CA 947 10. Results of research with two oldfield herbaceous species suggest that VAM fungi are very important to plant growth at high plant densities, but have little or no effect on growth at lower densities. Since plants that colonize bare areas are often non- mycorrhizal this suggests a hypothetical mechanism for the com- petitive exclusion of these species by later invaders. 148.6. Phase II of the Crescent Bypass Revegetation Project. Jonathan A. Oldham, Kings River Conservation District, 4886 E. Jensen Avenue, Fresno, CA 93725. New techniques including planting cuttings with a "hydrodriller," improved irrigation with Vertical Irrigation Pipes, burning weeds in preparation to planting, improved berm design, and better planting site location led to substantial increases in survival of transplanted trees and shrubs over Phase I of this project. 148.7. The trigger-factor approach to the initiation of natural regenera- tion of plant communities of industrially damaged lands at Sud- bury, Ontario. Keith Winterhaider, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario P3E 2C6. Natural regeneration on 10,000 ha of barren, acid, metal- contaminated soil has produced only a low-diversity edaphic climax community of metal-tolerant species. However, applying ground limestone to the surface has triggered rapid colonization by native woody pioneer species such as Betula papyrifera and Populus tremuloides. 148.8. Woody plant succession on disposal areas of the Tennessee- Tom- bigbee Waterway. Jeanne J. Hartley and Dale H. Arner. Woody species succession was monitored at 20 sites whose edaphic characteristics included low pH and coarse, sandy tex- tures. Primary pioneer woody species, including loblolly pine, black willow, sweetgum, winged sumac and rol maple, were found in higher numbers in areas planted with a mixture of native grasses and forbs and in lesser amounts in sites predominated by Lespedeza cune ata. 149. Revegetation by land imprinter and rangeland drill. Warren P. Clary. Res. Paper INT-397. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station. The land imprinter and rangeland drill were compared for revegetation effectiveness in a Wyoming big sagebrush (Ar- temisia indentata spp. wyomingensis) vegetation type that had just experienced a wildfire. Total plant cover and seeded plant densities were significantly higher with the imprinting treatment. Results suggest that imprinting as a revegetation technique is most effective when competing plants are absent and when the seedbed is light textured or loosened by disking. 150.

The results of a test plot study utilizing the Ferti-Blast pneumatic equipment to seed and fertilize highly erodible slopes indicates that the equipment has limited value when working with lighter grass seeds, but is more effective with heavier seeds. Its optimal use, however, is for applying fertilizer on slopes or in landscaped areas. 151. FROM: The International Erosion Control Association 1 989 Conference. 151.1.

Cooperative Park Studies Unit at the Univer- sity of Wisconsin-Madison Will Focus On Restoration Ecology Don Field, Associate Dean, University of Wiscon- sin-Madison, School of Natural Resources, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, 1450 Linden Drive, Room 240, Madison, WI 53706 (608) 262- 6968 The University of Wisconsin recently reached an agreement with the National Park Service to estab- lish a Cooperative Park Studies Unit (CPSU) at its Madison campus. The University's emphasis on restoration ecology, in particular, drew the attention of the Park Service and will serve as the principal theme for the relationship. This specialized field of study, emanating from the University and its Ar- boretum, should provide the Park Service with the kind of knowledge necessary to restore native habitats and/or work with adjacent land owners to preserve park ecosystems. The collective talents of the Institute for Environ- mental Studies, the School of Natural Resources, the Arboretum staff and the faculty in the College of Letters and Science offer a unique opportunity for faculty and park officials to work together to provide the applied knowledge that will help preserve, re- store and manage our parks' natural and cultural resources for the benefit of a world community. 153. Earthwatch Announces Grants for Field Research In 1990, Earthwatch will award grants of$10, 000 to $100,000 for 1 10 projects that address significant questions in the sciences and humanities. The Cen- ter for Field Research invites scientists and scholars engaged in ecological restoration, resource manage- ment and sustainable technologies to apply for awards of funds and volunteer staff. Research design must include participation by non-specialist volunteers since all funds for the re- search are obtained from the contributions of par- ticipating volunteers selected from the Earthwatch membership. Preliminary proposals may be made by telephone or by detailed letter to the Center. Upon favorable review, full proposals will be invited for submission 12 months prior to the proposed project's fielding date.

Common Riparian Plants of Calif ornia: A Field Guide for the Layman . Phyllis M. Faber and Robert F. Holland. 1988. Mill Valley, California: Pickleweed Press. $18.00 plus $3.00 for handling and tax. Soft cover, 140 pp., illus.; index. This book begins with a good overview of the Californian riparian habitat. The "embryonic field of riparian restoration" is cited as a way to become actively involved in the protection of these "special environments." The body of the book then lists 121 common plants from the montane regions of the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Ranges and their foothills, and from the Great Valley, the desert, and coastal California. Each entry includes a non-technical description of the plant's range, its notable physical characteristics and a full-size black/white photocopy of its leaves, fruit or flowers. The large (9" x 12") format is only partly success- ful, since the book would prove cumbersome in the field. Also the quality of the photocopies is incon- sistent, and many lack the clarity of a good botanical drawing. Finally, the book offers little idea about how these plants function or co-exist as riparian communities. Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="26">107 164.

Paper. 188 pp., biblio., appen., gloss; illus., index. This is an activist's guide for the layperson who wishes to protect, restore and/or manage a lake or reservoir. It is both thoughtful and well organized, offering many examples and case studies. While heavily endorsing the scientific method of problem solving, the guide employs a writing style which is clear and unburdened by scientific jargon. For the lake property owner or the civic activist this manual offers an excellent opportunity to begin to understand the nuances encountered when deal- ing with the natural and political realities of lake protection and/or restoration. 168. NALMS Management Guide for Lakes &amp; Reser- voirs . M. Lynn Moore. 1989. Washington, D.C.: North American Lake Management Society, softcover. 42 pp. $7.50 illus. This is the little brother of the previous entry. It covers much of the same material but without the in-depth discussion or insightful case studies. The major focus is on management for water quality so that, in contrast with the other book, there is little discussion of restoration. On the other hand, its price is attractive and the book does offer the lay reader an opportunity to begin to understand what is involved in lake management. 169. Sources of Native Seeds and Plants.

Written in an easy to understand style, this glossy booklet provides important information to the citizen who is curious about how to "protect" a wetland area. It introduces the potential players in wetland degradation and preservation, the current laws and/or regulations that influence wetland use, and summarizes the various strategies available for ensuring the protection of these disappearing habitats. It also provides phone listings and maps of pertinent federal agencies throughout the country. 171. The National Wildflower Research Center's Wildflower Handbook. 1989. Staff of the Na- tional Wildflower Research Center. Austin: Texas Monthly Press. 320 pp. paper, $9.95. biblio. The National Wildflower Research Center offers this book as their guide to landscaping with in- digenous native plants. As such it does provide information on a variety of related topics, including wildflower seed mixes, prairie recreations, guidelines for collecting seed, and more. These chapters of the book are presented in a non-technical format and should prove "friendly" to a wide audience. The book's strengths, however, are its bibliographies, listings of conservation and restora- tion organizations, and sources for wildflower seeds and native plants. While there are a few con- spicuous omissions, they are forgivable in an initial effort of this kind. On the whole this book provides a valuable contribution to the restoration community as source of advice and intercommunication.

Van der Valk's collection describes in detail the numerous factors which constitute the wetland communities of the Prairie Pothole region and the Nebraska Sandhills. It offers restorationists plenty in terms of technical information regarding the hydrology, chemistry, floral and faunai aspects of the area. The chapter on the dynamics of wetland vegetation is especially informative. Anyone doing restoration work in the region will want to take a long look at this book. 174. Field Guide for Wetland Delineation: Unified Federal Method. 1989. Wetland TVaining In- stitute, Inc. P.O. Box 1022. Poolesville, MD 20837-0099. WTI89-1. 131 pp. glossary. This manual is intended as a concise, convenient field guide for those involved in determining "juris- dictional wetlands." It describes the new unified method that will now be used by all federal agencies to determine upland/wetland boundaries. To that end, it is well done, if a bit dry and deficient in graphics. The bigger problem is not so much with the book as with the generic approach offered by the unified federal methodology. It reduces the wide variety of wetland situations in this nation to single instances. Bureaucratic uniformity, it appears, may be tending toward displacing regional diversity. Against that we know we must be vigilant. At least this book lets us know the new rules by which the game will be played. 175. Restoration of Habitats Impacted by Oil Spills. 1984.

A product of an Exxon-funded workshop held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1981, this book explores the problem of oil spills in a variety of habitats - rocky shores, seagrass colonies, salt marshes, mangroves, coral reefs, and tundra. Each chapter explains the impact of oil and/or oil by-products on the environment and the place of restoration in the overall clean-up process. Examples from spills around the world are used to document and describe the interaction between the contaminant, ecosystem, and recovery processes. 176. In Defense of Wildlife: Preserving Com- munities &amp; Corridors. 1989. Gay Mackin- tosh (ed.). Washington: Defenders of Wildlife. 96 pp. paper, $10.00. At its core this book is concerned with "keep[ing] every cog and wheel." With that in mind the editor has brought together some well-known authors to discuss forest fragmentation and the need for linkages between existing reserves in order to help maintain diverse populations of threatened and en- dangered fauna. For restorationists the chapter by Aubrey Stephen Johnson, "The Thin Green Line: Riparian Corridors and Endangered Species in Arizona and New Mexico" is especially relevant. Johnson details the importance of the riparian corridor in the desert Southwest and discusses how we continue, through our various land and water-use policies, to destroy that habitat. While restoration is technically feasible, he concludes that national and regional politics are interfering with its application. The final chapters include an update on the im- plementation and reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act and a comprehensive review of federal and state nongame wildlife programs, including habitat conservation. Reclamation 177. Prairie Species Used in Borrow Pit Reclama- tion (Ohio) Donald R. Geiger, Department of Biology, Univer- sity of Dayton, Dayton, OH 45469 (513) 229-2509; and Denis G. Conover, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 (513)556-9728 In the spring of 1986 we began reclamation of a 5.6-ha site that had been excavated for sand and gravel. Native prairie species were selected for planting because prairie relicts are found in the immediate area, and because these species are suitable for this site, where seasonal moisture con- Winter 1989 Restoration &amp; Management Notes 7:2</page><page sequence="28">109 ditions range from flooding to very dry. The development of a prairie also satisfied our need for an easily maintained, attractive natural area in a location marked by rapid urban development. The site has recently been designated as a nature preserve. A range of edaphic conditions exist throughout the borrow pit area. While the site is generally well-drained, a number of clay lenses form seeps that persist except in the driest times. The more active of these supply an ephemeral pond in the basin. This variety of habitats allows for a great variety of plants, representing species from both wet and dry prairies (Conover and Geiger, 1989). Given the steep slopes, rough terrain, and the large area to be seeded, we hired a firm to hydroseed eight prairie grass species. For the initial planting, seeds for the grasses and three prairie forbs were purchased from a source in Missouri. For sub- sequent plantings, grass and forb seeds were col- lected locally. Prairie forb seeds that were available in quantity were broadcast and raked into the soil. Forb seeds in small supply, or from rare or difficult to establish species, were planted in a nursery and the plants later transplanted to the prairie. Forbs were raised either in plastic containers (Rootmaster, Hummert Co., St. Louis, MO), or in 5-cm diameter clear polyethylene film tubing, 30 cm in length. In some cases seeds were stratified in flats and transplanted to the tubes or containers after germination. In other cases seeds were stratified outdoors in the containers and transplanted to the prairie in the spring when the roots just reached the bottom of the containers. Dormant plants, collected locally from habitats about to be destroyed, were transplanted in the spring. Differential success in germination and survival is producing a number of distinct associations of grasses and forbs. Established plants are serving as a source of seeds, and now, after three seasons, new plants are becoming established in well- suited microhabitats. To date, approximately 36 species of Ohio prairie indicator plant species have become established on the site despite the severe drought of 1988. Current efforts are focused on ridding the site of introduced weeds such as western ragweed, Ambrosia psilostachya , increasing the diversity of species present, and planting rare and endangered species that we have raised from seed.

Restoration Ecology, Integrated Conservation Strategies, and En- dangered Species: What's the Connection? Don Falk, Center for Plant Conservation, 125 Arbor Way, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130 Philosophically, Mr. Falk argues, restoration offers us an approach to conservation based on the unity of human beings and "nature." It offers us a way to heal and regenerate natural systems as we learn to live within ecological constraints. In more practical terms restoration will be integrated into a successful biodiversity strategy along with traditional forms of conservation. 178.2. Endangered plant recovery: Experimental approaches with Cor- dylanthus maritimus spp. marítimas. Brian H. Fink and Joy B. Zedier, Biology Dept., San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182. Greenhouse tests revealed that the hemiparasite, Cordylan- thus maritimus spp. maritimus, produced more biomass and more flowers when grown with the salt marsh grasses, Distichlis spicata and Monanthochloe littoralis. Furthermore, it was salt tolerant only in the presence of these host plants. Biomass was also increased by providing 20-50 percent shade. 178.3. Reestablishment of Barrett's penstemon (Penstemon barrettiae ) at Bonneville Lock, Columbia River, Oregon. Julie Kierstead, Berry Botanic Garden, 1 1505 SW Summerville Ave., Portland, OR 97219. Removed from a USACE construction site, a population of this endangered species has been preserved as cuttings and seeds taken by the Berry Botanical Garden. Seeds have been stored as backup material, while the cuttings have been rooted in a green- house for outplanting near the Bonneville Dam. Reestablishment appears successful although site selection and preparation remain a concern. 178.4. The creation of artificial habitat for a rare plant, Pogogyne abramsii, in San Diego County, California. Paul H. Zedier, Biology Department, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182-0057. The expansion of San Diego has destroyed much of the vernal pool habitat for Pogogyne abramsii. In response, artificial pools have been created, and while some appear capable of maturing into reasonable facsimiles of natural vernal pools, others have been failures, according to Zedier. The results suggest that res- toration may have limited value in the conservation of this species' habitat.

Marylee Guinon, LSA Associates, Point Richmond, CA. Too frequently costs of restoration projects are reported out of context and do not include all the costs for planning, acquisi- tion, permitting, etc.. This can lead restorationists and planners to underestimate the costs for future restoration projects, which may result in both environmental and financial failure. 179.3. Ecological restoration and environmental mitigation: A relation- ship worth scrutinizing. Lee C. Hackeling, Planning Division, Army Corp of Engineers, Los Angeles, CA; Mark K. Leach, Steven I. Apfelbaum. Restoration as a concept or practice used to justify resource modification or loss requires careful consideration. Restorations can fail and some ecosystems may be unrestorable. Sound ecological standards should be required before mitigation plans are accepted. 179.4. Top-down planning: An integrated approach to restoration goals, criteria of success and monitoring in coastal wetlands. Keith B. MacDonald, Michael Brandman Associates, 4918 N. Har- bor Drive, Suite 205, San Diego, CA 92 106. Top-Down Planning assumes that the ecological value of a given ecological community is best expressed by the continued presence of higher trophic-level species that typically utilize that community for shelter and nourishment. Habitat creation operates in the opposite direction, beginning with the physical environ- ment then to plant community development ending in the colonization by animals of higher and higher trophic-levels. This stage-by-stage complementary approach provides a basis for defining the successful completion of a project. Issues And Perspectives 180. FROM: The Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of SERM, 1989. 1 80. 1 . Restoration and aesthetics: Ecological management of remnant native plant communities as a landscape design alternative in developed areas of the Mid-Atlantic region. Stacy Levy, Sere, Ltd., 5023 McKean Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19144. Laymen often reject or destroy remnant native landscapes because to them they appear disturbed or chaotic. Pervasive and intimate access to an attractive, comprehensible native landscape is a key to altering such attitudes. The landscape designer or manager should seek to enhance and dramatize the patterns of the restored native landscape. 180.2. The art of ecological restoration. David Valbracht, P.O. Box 5382, Lacey,WA 98503. Restoration should be recognized as an art form. Like other forms of design, it is the result of aesthetic choice as well as functional goals. The landscape, itself, provides aesthetic inspira- tion to the observant restorationist. 180.3. Feedback loops that work. Stephanie Kaza, Ph.D., UC-Berkeley Botanical Gardens, Centennial Drive, Berkeley, CA 94720. From the point of view of formal systems theory, restoration is a behavioral shift in response to a breakdown of functioning feedback loops. Restorationists, thus, must become aware of their own their habits of stereotyping, objectifìcation and projection as they begin to develop a wider perspective and understanding of the systems they are concerned with. 181. FROM: The Proceedings of the 1989 Vernal Pools Workshop. 181.1. Observations on the creation of artificial habitat for species preservation. Paul H. Zedier and Charles Black, Biology Dept., San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92 182-0057. These authors question the creation of artificial habitats which cannot become self-sustaining. According to them, the more drastically modified the re-creation, the more uncertain becomes the project's long-term dynamics, and ultimately, its success. They view artificial habitat creation not as a theoretical activity, but rather a matter of costs and benefits in a real world context. They conclude that even though artificial habitats can be created, the differences between natural and artificial systems should not be trivialized to the point of accepting artificial habitats as a general solution to the problem of conserving rare ecosystems. 182. Restoring Natural Areas. Steve Packard. Natural Areas Journal 9(2):78-79. Packard argues against "keeping all our ecological eggs in the basket of small unchanging preserves,. . ." Instead he advocates the acquisition and restoration of degraded areas large enough for natural plant communities to develop into long-term, self-sup- porting entities. He acknowledges this process may not be easy and that it will require a wider perspective from natural areas managers. This new perspective, he concludes, will offer us an opportunity to participate in the larger social effort to forestall environmental degradation generally. 1 83. The dangers of transplantation as a conservation technique. D. Fashelt, Department of Plant Science, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5B7. Natural Areas Journal 8(4):238- 244. The author argues against relying on translocation of rare wild species as a sound conservation technique. He suggests seeding and growing from cuttings as appropriate approaches for in- dividual species but looks to ecological restoration and in situ protection as the means to care for existing ecosystems.
