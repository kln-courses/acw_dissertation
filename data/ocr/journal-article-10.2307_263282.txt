Those who have used Mr. Hicks's masterly edition of the De Anima and his excellent "Stoic and Epicurean"' are aware that he is a careful and critical worker. The present judicious text and well-written translation of the in- dispensable Diogenes Laertius will be a great convenience to students of 1 Cf.

Mr. Hicks does not attempt to rehabilitate Diogenes Laertius as a scholar, critic, and philosopher, but sensibly qualifies the extreme view that he was an ignorant plagiarist of a single authority and incapable of reading any of the older writers for himself. I should be willing to maintain the thesis that Diogenes is a better historian of philosophy than some that are advertised as best sellers today. He does not misrepresent metaphysical doctrines more grossly than they. And he has at least the Herodotean merit of telling us something in every paragraph and sentence. For the rest, Mr. Hicks under- stands his subject and knows Greek, and it would be superfluous to enlarge upon the fact that this translation can be trusted. I shall not be misunder- stood, if I devote my brief space mainly to the discussion of some points on which difference of opinion is permissible. The very few positive errors appear to be mere inadvertences. i. 3. For ii4 ' )v should we not read &amp;4A' oA? Surely the point is not that the human race began with the Greeks but that the achievements of the Greeks both in philosophy and in other things from the beginning have been attributed to the barbarians. Apelt feeling this translates without warrant of the Greek "mit der Bildung des Menschengeschlechts.'' i. 5. Does not pathos mean "anthropomorphic affections" rather than "human suffering"? i. 8. "Aristotle in .... his dialogue on philosophy." Should a transla- tion prejudge the question whether it was a dialogue? i. 12. Can OaTrrov mean "all too quickly," or is it merely idiomatic? i. 65. ot S' e7rLTpE7rovTE%, "the popular leaders." Is it not rather "those who allowed that sort of thing," "those who yielded" (cf. Plato Meno 92B)? i. 80. "Shinny on your own side" would be more like what the boys said than "keep to your own sphere." i. 97. "Leave gain to trades pursued for gain" is a very free, if not im- probable, version of &amp;ELv yap 'aa KEp&amp;aVTa KiepSa'veV. i. 105. ovinev aEO,uaL is better and more idiomatic than ov'Se3. i. 106. EXE'TrX7v is surely the "handle," not the "share," of a plow. i. 122. No'eLV is not "be thought out" but "apprehend or interpret by thought," and alv60CoouaL is not "mine is all guesswork" but "I speak in riddles." iv. 5. 7rpos TVr 'Ap,apTvpov is not "A Reply to the Anonymous Work" but "On [or in Competition with] the Plea in a Case without Witnesses." Cf. the commentators on Isoc. Or. 21 and Panegyr. 188; also Blass, Attische Beredsamkeit, II, 220, and D.L., VI, 15, where the title is correctly trans- lated. iv. 40. ue?v, 7rXrv &amp;XX' alTqrvta means, "He went to dinners, with his own kind, to be sure, but he did go," with a hint of reproach. The expression is a variation on the more frequent idiom ,AEv dXX' g,uzs. Apelt also misses this point. iv. 59. AXVKv1ITara, 1X'qKfvaL, "A most amusing story is told." Apelt:</page><page sequence="3">110 BOOK REViEWS "Soll er sehr gutmiltig gewesen sein." This divergence perhaps supports my emendation, XLy0Xpo'Tara (cf. Class. Phil., IV, 86). vii. 5. KaL T yro XpLov a4rEp&amp;TaTaTOV 7roL)q(aL is not "to keep the spot clear of a concourse of idlers" but to purge or purify it morally, as the following yap would warn a wary reader. The new Liddell and Scott, though much better than the old on this word, misses the point. Apelt also wrongly: "den Platz von jeder St6rung zu bewahren." viii. 6. KaKorEXvL71v is rather "an art of mischief" than "poor workman- ship." viii. 38. SVOrXEp7 OdEOv XC'yES is not, I think, "what an ill-tempered god," but (ironically) "a fastidious god, indeed" (cf. my note on Plato Politicus 266C, Class. Phil., XII, 308). Apelt is nearly right with: "Traun, ein gutiger Gott." ix. 5. Does &amp;ro Trovy cvv9XovTros mean "continuous," or is it rather "from its content, its main theme"? Apelt, following the Didot: generaliter im allgemeinen. ix. 25. 7roXX;Av Aav/raVo,uv i7raLv is not, I think, "more skilled than many a one," but "superior to many an illusion or appearance" (cf. the use of 8 0's vi7rEpavw in ii. 96, of wracvu in vi. 28, and vtrepamv in vii. 93 and vii. 128). ix. 74. May not vewLavTras here mean "by a nod or a gesture" rather than "if we had actually assented"? The meaning would then be that the skeptics use words as colorlessly as gestures, without committing themselves to the verbal implication. ix. 83. May not alyyas here mean not "customs" but "schools of phi- losophy," the idea being that of Bacon's eidola theatri? In ix. 99, oiv8e KLVETaL means "isn't moved at all" rather than "still less, etc." The translation of the letters of Epicurus, in the tenth book, repeats, with slight changes and verbal improvements, the versions given in the author's "Stoic and Epicurean." As I said in reviewing that, the interpretation of these difficult texts requires a treatise, not a review. PAUL SHOREY</page></plain_text>
