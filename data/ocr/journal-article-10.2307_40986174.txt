Since 1948, he has BEEN KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE CARIBBEAN AND THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING WORLD AS A MAJOR LITERARY FORCE, RECOGNIZED FOR THE CONSISTENT STRENGTH AND INSIGHT IN HIS SEVENTEEN BOOKS OF POETRY AS WELL AS IN NUMEROUS ESSAYS AND PLAYS. He IS ALSO AN ACCOMPLISHED PAINTER AND teacher. he has received a rockefeller fellowship, the guinness Award for Poetry, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Royal Society of Literature's Heinnemann Award, and a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award. In 1992, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Currently he divides his time between New York City and St. Lucia. This interview took place in Derek Walcott 's home in St. Lucia in July 28 and 30, 2001 and later in his residence in New York City on November 28, 2001. "The Bounty" is in many ways a meditation on death brought on by your mother's passing. What is the legacy your mother's faith has left you? Generally speaking, I would say I haven't in any way adopted my mother's virtues. I don't think I am quite as devoted and as faithful as she was. I think that she was a praise-giving woman, and I think that I must have picked that up from her, and a devotion and strength to doing what she had to do in raising her children and encouraging me in writing verse and being a poet. I would say that the word "gratitude" is the key, I believe, to the whole answer, gratitude, but not necessarily an orthodox kind of faith. How do you balance the need to become a great poet with the need to become a great man? Well, I don't think you should ever be conscious of a desire to be a great poet. It's all technical. It's all whether the technique that one has, what one has learned in terms of the craft, becomes better and better, although it becomes more and more difficult, because the more you learn, the more what you have learned looks like tricks, or habit. So you are constantly fighting not to repeat what you have already tried to do. I guess that the greatness is in the effort, not in the achieve- ment. Is there a point, though, at which the effort of writing and putting one's life and one's thoughts into words comes at a cost to what one could contribute to a community, to a neighborhood, to a family, to relationships?</page><page sequence="2">96 Journal of Caribbean Literatures Well, I never listen to anybody who says they don't have time to write. And I get it a lot from people who used to be students of mine, particularly women who say that they haven't tried to write a poem in a long time. Some of them are very gifted, and they've stopped for various reasons, more easily because they are women, because questions of motherhood and looking after a house and after a husband come up. And you know, the daily labor that every woman does now is very exact- ing. Some of them have a job and they come home from a job and they have to make dinner, and when do you sleep if you have children? You know, it's merciless in terms of what can happen to a young woman today who is not really liberated but more trapped in a way by the fact that the office may be a trap, because she may be a devoted worker, and her house equally having her trapped because she wants to write but doesn't have the time because she has to look after children and her husband and so on. I think that it is more difficult than ever for a young woman to be a writer. On the other hand, writing should come above everything else. It should come above everything else, above your children, your husband, your wife, your work. And once that's there, perhaps you can have a better sense of the accommodation of time. But a writer will make the time. If that's what you want to do and if you do it, then there is a possibility of a more rhythmic kind of attitude to your writing. If you have to get up at 7:00 a.m., then get up an hour earlier and at least do an hour's work daily, or when you come home and everybody else has gone to bed, find the time. I don't listen to these excuses of pressure, even if they are definitely there and heavier, I think, than ever. The nature of a writer is to write, and if that begins to fade, then, that to me is very sad that it should happen, because I think that there is a response possible. People who write verse when they are young don't have to remain poets, because I think that the craft of verse helps to make excellent editors or journalists or whatever profession you practice. That discipline of writing verse gives you a sense of judgment much more fine than if one hadn't practiced the craft at all. So there is a useful aspect to it, quite apart from the making of poems that I consider to be vital. But if the practice wanes and it doesn't happen, then there is a lot of sadness that goes with it, a lot of regret, almost remorse in a sense, that they don't continue, and it is very sad to talk to them and find that they've given that up, simply because of the excuse of time. Is there any remorse on the other side of it though? Have you ever felt regret- ful that you Ve given more to your art than you have to people? No, no. I got it from my mother. My father was a writer and he had a regular job, but they weren't rich. She admired him for what he did, and the same thing has come from me, and my children have understood that. I have been told that some- times I would come to the table when I was living with Margaret, and I'd sit at the table and not say a word and then get up and go. But I didn't intend to do that. It's just that I must have let the work I was doing come to the table. I had my lunch or</page><page sequence="3">Interview with Derek Walcott 97 breakfast and then would go back to my work. And they've told me about that. Do I feel bad about it? No, I don't feel bad about it. I feel that I might have been able to say a couple of words, but that kind of levity is not the kind of mood I was in. So there are deeper regrets that are much more profound than, say, not talking too much at table. But I am never really withdrawn from my children, so it's not a matter of always being inaccessible, it's just that it would happen sometimes. So that's a difficulty, but I think I've been lucky in having people from my mother on who understood that that's what I wanted to be, not that my mother let me be somebody by myself who worked, or something pompous like that, but just that they understood that that's what I did, and that if I was painting or working it wasn't a good idea to interrupt me. I think they learned that very early. Why are painting and poetry necessary to society? To the naysayers, who look at art as something that you do as recreation rather than vocation, how do you defend its ethical power? Well, any society that has to ask that, and they all do, is in trouble. Almost every society is in trouble, and every society gets deeper and deeper into trouble when it disacknowledges the necessity of art. So the answer to that is that when you come to an extreme condition, as say in a dictatorship where the dictatorship goes after the artist because he knows the damage they can do, then you know the answer to why art is necessary. Ask the dictator and he will tell you why he is doing what he is doing, because art sows questioning. It sows what they may con- sider to be treacherous to the state, and not in complete devotion to anything. And the rebelliousness that's there in art is not only an active rebelliousness, it's a curiosity. But why do I have to do this? Why do I have to write a poem? That's a question you would have to take all the way up to people like Mandelstam, under arrest or in prison. Or people who have had to record their thoughts by whatever means possible out ofthat necessity of saying what they feel, which is even for the good of the people who don't mind that they are in prison. Then that's where your crisis comes in. The worst sickness of a society is indifference. It's not cruelty, and cruelty is intolerable as a concept, but indifference is perhaps even more intolerable, and that's what the Caribbean has. The Caribbean has a lot of indifference from people who should have a little more recognition for the artists that live with them. If the artists knew that if they got up one day and sang a calypso, they'd throw them in jail and beat the shit out of them, I mean they'd still keep singing. And they'd sing in different places. I'm not saying that they should now start beating calypsonians so that they get a better art, but I'm just saying that if all the young artists around me suffer from that indifference and consider that to be a major crime committed by West Indian governments and society, some of these people dry up and some of them go crazy. If you took a condition in which two people are in prison, say, two guys are condemned to death, and one of them takes out a piece of paper and starts to write</page><page sequence="4">98 Journal of Caribbean Literatures a poem, which may be a farewell to the world or a praise of what he enjoyed or loved, the other guy might ask him, "Why are you writing?" And the other guy would simply say, "1 have to put this down, for what I feel, and I have to put it in some kind of order." So if you take the person who is asking the question, you can translate that into the equivalent of a government and an artist. The government would say, "But why do you have to write, why do you need a theater, why do you need this or that?" And the guy who is writing, who is condemned, would say, "I have to do it, I must do it. That's why I have to do it." It's not necessary. Nothing in art is necessary, but it is inevitable. Is it enough, though, to say that art is inevitable, that one has to do it and therefore the discussion is over? Virtually, yes. I mean, who needs another poem, even if it's by Mandelstam? You don't need it really. That's what I mean by art being unnecessary. That's the inherent contradiction of it. It's unnecessary, but it's inevitable. It can't be stopped. What do you think of Whitman's optimism about democracy and regenera- tion? Do you share it? All these large poets, poets with great vision, whether they are Neruda or St. John Perse or Whitman, the width of their vision is immense, it can be immense, but I don't necessarily think it's a racial thing, and it's not necessarily something you can attribute to a particular poet of a particular society either. And if that's the case then it's a limited vision of a thing. If you talk of vision, ultimately, you talk of vision that comes through experience, and so there's a radiance that comes out of experience. The inevitability of a Whitman comes out of history. It comes out of someone urging his country to build anew. It's more polemical than it is real. It's an idea, it's a vision of things growing, and so on, but it is also a vision of something that is really confined strictly to perhaps one race, or perhaps one kind of American. Here's a Negro carpenter, a black carpenter, maybe an Indian doing something, and that catalog of democracy that is there is fine, and Whitman is saying I am infusing all these people with a breadth, and a love, and a width, and a direction that is democratic that is a vision of the future. But still, as pure as that may be, and as lovely as that may be in terms of the faith, the belief of what can happen, it doesn't go down deeper in terms of "Why is the carpenter not a General?" He says that there is a social order, and each person has the function in that society, that broad vision of a great America in which everybody has a job to do. But the jobs are the same jobs. They are hierarchical. It's not like saying, "I see, I have a vision in which tomorrow the black man will be president." That would be polemical and a little dumb in a sense. On the other hand it would be closer to a radical possibility than the generic bliss that was there in Whitman, which can offend people who feel they are not particularly a part ofthat reality.</page><page sequence="5">Interview with Derek Walcott 99 Painting now has an established tradition of abstraction. What do you think of poetry that tries to be abstract and postmodern? There is no such thing possible as abstract poetry because words have to make sense. There are people who are trying to do it though. It's impossible. It's a futile exercise and it's absurd. And it's the activity of pseudo- avante-guardists, which is tiring anyway, because one of the points of language is sense, and they may say, "What do you mean by sense?" and I stop there because I no longer go into those self-twisting arguments, etc., etc. So if one is talking about painting, perhaps I am talking about the kind of painting I do, or the kind of paint- ing I like. My theory of painting is principally light, the theory of light, physical light. This may certainly not apply to abstract representation at all, and therefore I can be a dinosaur in terms of what my opinion is, in terms of the kind of painting that I like to do. There can be a name for it that is "representational," or something. But all that vocabulary comes from the centers. That vocabulary comes from Lon- don and Paris and Berlin and wherever. Therefore, when I encounter that vocabu- lary I feel anger that my choices are being defined by decades, by centuries, by people I have nothing to do with, whom I have nothing in common with. If somebody in Berlin says, "nobody paints like that anymore in Berlin, and what we are doing is putting wire and bush on a canvas and painting it," whatever technique that is, that is a chronological concept that is from history that includes art. In other words, "we have exhausted representation, now we are doing some- thing that will take the approbation of someone who understands what we are trying to do." Therefore, I am supposed to fall in line, chronologically to the evo- lution, and I am old fashioned in the sense that I am staying in the kind of a context that may be nineteenth century, that may be eighteenth century, or whatever. What I resist is the definition and chronology imposed on me by the center. That's what I object to. And I object to it in my attitude to verse as well. I have a lot of contempt for people who experiment purely for the alleged achievement that is there in experiment and for the discovery that is there in experiment. I think that experiment in many ways is a form of conceit, and not that I'm humbler than anybody else, but I'm not interested in a demonstration of intelligence. I don't think the intellect is not a dangerous thing. I think that it is dangerous in the sense that it makes divisions and makes judgments of things. It's Blake's position about the intellect. It's the same position, no different. How do you explain the fact that your painting is so much more consistently representational, almost traditionally so, than your poetry, which sometimes involves pastiche and welcomes violations of narrative expectations? Now I have a very simple answer to that. One is how hard it is. Something Chaucer said, and Milton said it in another way. "This life's so short, and this craft is so long to learn." It should apply to any craft, but particularly in Chaucer's case,</page><page sequence="6">1 00 Journal of Caribbean Literatures to poetry. It seems to me to be increasingly difficult, more and more difficult, to render light, and by light, to render lineaments. That is one of the toughest things in the world, and it looks like one of the easiest. Because, why is it that a prose passage by Hemingway next to a prose passage of another writer using almost the same words, almost in the same order, doesn't catch? Why is it Steinbeck does not ignite or illuminate the same way that Hemingway did? Why is it all these writers around Hemingway still do not approximate that? It's not magic; it is real. And the reality I am talking about is there in Dante. That's what I consider to be the peak of effort: Not to render things as they are exactly, but to somehow illuminate them by the simplicity of what the vocabulary may be, or the thought may be. The simplic- ity I am talking about is a striving, that Rilke described in terms of saying if I had the ability to name things over, I would be able to say "loaf," "bread," the same thing Larkin speaks about, and it's the same principal actually of the Adamic idea of renaming. That is a poetic principal. To name something. We write the same words over and over. We write the word "glass;" we write the word "book;" we write the word "bread;" and we can keep writing poems in which these words are, but it takes a particular instant of illumination that might make those words "glass," "book," or whatever, suddenly have a clarity, and a validity, and a presence that they didn't have before, even if they still sound the same, or come from the same vocabulary. And that is what is the greatness, and it is a gift actually. I think it is a special, and I think I am brave enough to say, almost a divine gift that that illumination can happen with the simplicity of what we are given. It is what makes a touchstone that makes the words in their particular order happen, even if another writer is using the same vocabulary. So what is that? That is something that is much more important and is possible in a sense than a lot of confused approaches from that school and this, you know. I'm out ofthat; I'm away from that. I consider myself blessed that I was never a part ofthat, being aligned to a particular school, which I can be easily, of course, by being called a post-colonial writer, or some other kind of writer, or whatever. You've mentioned that our appreciation of Greek art is really an appreciation for fragments, not what the art meant, or even looked like, in its time. You have also commented that time is the museum that selects great works of art. How do we have the confidence that what we consider to be masterpieces are not mere fragments of a much different whole? When we adore any artist who has lived and died hundreds of years ago, how do we know that we are not admiring something that isn't really there? Well, because I think every fragment has an echo. If it's a ruin, it has an ar- cheological echo. You finish the temple of which there is one column, it's finished in the mind. And so that presence of the echo is in a way the sound of history. It's what Pound has tried to do, and Eliot too, but principally Pound in terms of pieces of things that are echoes of what they were before. And our admiration of the fragment may be stronger than if we had the whole. The Venus de Milo without</page><page sequence="7">Interview with Derek Walcott 1 0 1 arms may be a stronger image than if her arms were full. And what a broken arm or a missing arm suggests is the violation of history, the change of time, the sort of desecration of the entity that is there, and also the nostalgia for the unfinished thing, or the finished ruin. All that is there in the ideas of fragments. To broaden it, what I have tried to say is that the fact that we don't have all these fragments in the Caribbean may be a beginning, the same Adamic thing that there is no temple, no broken ruins around to venerate and to lament in terms of saying, "Well, this used to be a great city. Here they did this, and here they did that." And instead of that what we have is stones and grass and stuff like that. Okay, that is very primal and very simplistic, but the simplistic is exactly what I'm talking about. If we could really go back to see what ancient Greece was like, it would be something like Puerto Rico, maybe. It's got a lot of bright statues and a lot of bright buildings. It would not be a bleached out Victorian idea of ruin and you know that kind of ghostly idea of Greece that we all prefer to think of, as if everyone walking around in Greece looked like a statue as opposed to somebody wearing bright clothes. We can never recreate the validity of an experience from which a writer comes out from, from which great, archaic, or ancient works come. That's practically all I'm saying. I think maybe what I'm connecting that to is, if you come to the Carib- bean now and you walk around the markets, you won't see architecture or ruins because that's not part of the history of the place. But that's exactly the vitality that existed thousands of years ago in any other culture. Any culture circulates around its markets, right? That's the center. The fish market, the vegetable market, wher- ever it is that people come to buy things and exchange goods. And that's what the center of the Caribbean experience is, it is in the market. If you were to go through the experience of the Caribbean market, and somehow you froze it and there was suddenly a Pompeii and everything was ash, then it would be given that kind of wash of nostalgia and bleachedness that would happen, even among black people, that would paralyze it in time. Always it's again the concept of time belonging to the center, that the center modulates and operates concepts of time. So you have to imagine the whole rather than the fragment? You don't look at Greece as the vulgar place it was, the vibrant, vulgar place it was. It's as if everybody was reciting Euripides when they went to buy the equiva- lent of a mango. You know, nobody talks like Euripides. In Paris, every taxi driver talks like Baudelaire? You know, it's not like that. People are bright and vulgar. I note an interesting vacillation in your work between a kind of African poly- theism in nature and a more, perhaps, Protestant way of saying, "I'm finding God in nature." How do you reconcile those two different views, or how do you feel philosophically about the idea of inspirited nature in terms of your approach to it as a poet?</page><page sequence="8">1 02 Journal of Caribbean Literatures Well, you can't, obviously, make nature denominational. You can't say, "These are Catholic trees. These are Baptist trees, and so forth." [laughter] You can't do that. Because it's vague and because it's plural then obviously it can be considered blasphemous, but that's the beginning of how I started anyway when the arch- bishop of St. Lucia accused me of blasphemies and of pantheism. So obviously to a Catholic, and maybe to any sect, when you say you feel the presence of some- thing, some presence that is superior to who you are, that feeling conforms in a particular way to the idea that there is one presence and that one presence can be called God. But you have to then go into a kind of sectarian attitude about what you mean by God, who do you mean by God? Do you mean an Anglican God or a Catholic God? When it becomes generic, then it becomes plural. In other words, what you feel is a presence I think that may be there in stones as separate from trees, trees as separate from clouds, and so forth, all one experience, but in a way the presences may be divided. I think that is probably the sensation that one gets particularly if you begin to describe it. If you describe a tree, and then a stream, then the hills. The summary of it could be, yes, it's one being, maybe; on the other hand, there is a joining that happens in terms of this particular tree, out of these particular stones giving out their own stony presences, and treelike presences that are maybe of one design or one experience, but they do come - it's the same process in fact as nam- ing in poetry and representation in painting. It proceeds from one object to an- other, one natural object to the other, which is also like Wordsworth, but it's also like any other painter, but you are progressing from one to the other. So I don't really see much of a problem in terms of admitting a pantheistic/monotheistic pres- ence, generally. The plural presence, which, without being fancy, could be a very African thing in the sense that each thing has a god, each presence has a god. I'm not saying that I have that, but I don't know how much of it is subliminal. I don't know how much of it is the African in me that may be feeling that, as opposed to the Methodist in me. I don't think you can have a Methodist in you, by the way, I mean it's possible but you can't. Generally you give that kind of branding to the Catholics, because Methodism is a modester thing. But after a while, modesty is insufficient for na- ture. It is too big and too frightening in a way, too awesome in a way, for it to be relegated to that kind of straight-minded, very rational process that is Protestant- ism as opposed to the liberating, accepting kind of multiplicity that can happen with Catholicism. I mean, the whole idea of Saints is the same as the idea of gods. No doubt that's why African belief found so much commonality with Catholi- cism. To go back to that illumination of a thing you spoke of earlier, how can an artist accomplish that? Is it different for a poet? I use Dunstan St. Omer as an example. Spiritually, Dunstan is a great painter, right, but he is not always even a good painter. He can be a very bad painter some- times. But that's part of the whole gesturing of the spirit, and what you are describ-</page><page sequence="9">Interview with Derek Walcott 1 03 ing is exactly what he has, and what I don't envy, but what I respect, and that is, he devours an idea. In other words, he celebrates contradictions, he celebrates duali- ties. He is a very devout Catholic, but he is also a very emphatic person in terms of race. In other words, his racelessness is an emphatic thing that says Christ has got to be thought of as black for black people, right? That's the point. You can't have a white Christ for black people - a very understandable point even if you say that Christ was a Jew, anyway, and therefore you should represent him as a Jew. And his view of Christhood, even if it's another or of the surrounding people, would be that, for the sake of adoration and belief, the object is anthropomorphic. You look at the object and therefore you are looking at yourself, in a way. That's a kind of cheap excuse of what the anthropomorphic is. But in saying what are black people doing kneeling to a supreme being, or a supreme personality even, like Christ, why should that representation be historically true, because what is being represented is not the historical truth? What is being represented is the faith that can manifest itself in the representation of Christ as black. Now that's an historical point that is not valid. On the other hand, faith is totally understandable and one should do that because all races make images of gods in their own images, right? It works both ways. But more than that, in the sweep of exaltation that Dunstan has, there is no reservation in that joy, or anger at times, whereas for me, there is a very measured argument about why I believe, or why I do this, or why I write like that, or why I feel cramped in my drawing, so that if I had that sweep of belief and sweep of exaltation, I would be a much better painter because then something more would be represented there. I don't mind it basically to think that I have never really gone for what is the purely exultant, because there is a kind of spiritual confidence there that to me can lead to arro- gance. And I think that Dunstan's arrogance is part of his faith, that his conceit is not really conceit; it is really humility, right? To think I am the greatest painter in the world is still a concept of doing service to painting rather than the ego of painting, which is an admirable thing and is very often misunderstood by that imitation that is there. I don't think I have that, but then I may have the opposite of that, which may be a little hypocritical. I have an excess, maybe, of humility, of fake humility, of fake modesty. The other thing I think is better. Dunstan's attitude is more admirable, in a way, more productive, in a way, than mine, because I'm cautious, careful, and more progressive. I'm remembering the passages from "Another Life" where you describe that difference, and you seem to align those differences with the generic differ- ences between painting and poetry, that your turn to poetry was to express a kind of self-questioning, or in poetry there's more hesitation there that's more agnostic. Is that fair to say? Yeah. I don't think you can be ambiguous in painting. Somebody will say, "Of course you can. Look at X and look at Y." But the fine painting is not ambiguous, but the fine poem can be ambiguous. There's a big difference. A painting is a</page><page sequence="10">1 04 Journal of Caribbean Literatures painting, and that's what it is. It may contain ambiguity visually, but ultimately, finally, it is not ambiguous. Whereas I can take a poem and it can remain ambigu- ous and still be greater, but still have that ambiguity of doubt and contradiction that is there. Is that part of what motivated you to write "Tiepolo's Hound"? Is your poem an attempt to return to this problem first raised in "Another Life" and to recover that ambiguity that is not represented in your own paintings or in those you discuss? Not really. The book is about Pissarro, too, principally about Pissarro, almost. And I would have to reexamine the conversation, which I've already done in the verse, I hope. Why Pissarro? Why was I attracted to the idea of Pissarro? First of all, the context of Pissarro, as I view it, is the Caribbean. He lived for a while in the Caribbean and then moved to Europe, which is, in a way, perhaps at that time necessary or inevitable in a young Frenchman, not thinking of himself as a Carib- bean person at all. I don't think he ever thought of himself as a Caribbean person, someone who was born in St. Thomas. It didn't mean necessarily that he didn't think of himself as a St. Thomasian, or whatever that means, but he was a French- man, Jewish, and he went back to Paris. So my question was what might have happened to his painting if he had stayed in the Caribbean, which would mean that presumably, if one is talking about going to a university to study, when he began to paint on his own? Inevitably he would have produced masterpieces. And if those masterpieces were masterpieces of the Caribbean landscape, first of all wouldn't we be eager to grasp it as something belonging to us? And what might they have looked like if they were painted in the Caribbean? So it was a question, and he was White and Jewish, it was a question of leaving, of departure, of going to a bigger place and trying to follow a career. The parallel may be there for me. I've always found it necessary to a Carib- bean artist to remain rather than to go somewhere else. I don't insist on it, but I just have a feeling that if that location of your gift is specific in terms of where you are, particularly in the visual arts, and painting, or even in prose, that if the tendency is to finally abandon where you are from, then in a way you've denied it your gift and what you might have made of it, or made more of it. There are practicalities, like you have to get published, you have to be in a gallery and so forth, but I don't think these things are all ultimately necessary, because the people that we have as ex- amples weren't successful people as examples. We now praise Gauguin. Gauguin had a hard time, so did Van Gogh, so did all these people who are now giants, in terms of painting. So wherever they were, they were going through even more hell, right, than the individual right now who is living in Trinidad or St. Lucia, who is having a terrific life compared to the life that they had. So it is not a matter of financial pressure or stuff like that, it is a matter of where you feel you belong. I think there is another generation of Caribbean writer and artist now who feel that they can be where they are from and that represent that.</page><page sequence="11">Interview with Derek Walcott 1 05 There was that about Pissarro, but I also got more attracted to Pissarro when - I wasn't crazy about him earlier - as I wrote the book and began to think about what I was doing, I felt more attracted to the humility that was there in Pissarro. You can't be a humble painter. You have to paint well, paint hard, egotistically. But there was something modest, and not limited, humble, he wasn't limited, because he has brilliant paintings that are examples that Cezanne and other people ad- mired, and all the people admired his paintings. But the inner thing in him was not modest in the wrong sense, it kept its celebration, but it did not do it with distortion or with some thing that came out of an egotistical source. Whether it was accident or inevitable in some ways like in Van Gogh or Cezanne, or Gauguin even, the thing about Pissarro, is his keeping all the privation that he had and his keeping a sense of delight. It was constantly there in the worst conditions. I think that that is braver than a lot of the other stuff around him, less egotistical, because if you wanted to paint a landscape with line trees and some furrows, that's what he wanted to do and express that elation. The category you would have to put him is a search not for the true thing or for an expression of identity, but as an absolute search for anonymity. That is what's there in Wordsworth, the annihilation of the "I" that is there in the presence of nature. That to me shouldn't compare, but that's equally courageous, more courageous, maybe, than the other attempts to do things in a startling way. In a lecture you gave in New York in 1981, you said, "Every superstition is based, however dimly, in some spiritual truth because it springs from fear, but we have lost fear. Fear is habituated into horror." Have the events of September 11 changed that habituation of fear? Is fear now a reality in Ameri- can culture? And what does that do to poetry? What are the possibilities of poetry in the wake of what has happened? I have to be very careful answering because I haven't answered that question directly yet. I ought to be epigrammatic, but I would say that fear in American culture now is selfish; it is individual fear. It's the fear of what might happen to "me," and "my kids," and so on. Other countries don't have selfish fear. They are used to a communal fear. "They have bombed the shit out of us" or "X" is going to happen," and so on. So that fear is a generic thing that is shared by every man in that place that is engaged in practicality of fear. It has never happened before in this country that fear would be on land here and not somewhere else, fear about what might happen to one's family and son abroad, right? We've never had a war in this country. I'm glad I can say "we" because I identify with America. The horror of the event is great; it needed to be great to make an impression, it had to be an enormous horror for it to be respected. But think of the other side. We are now bombing and killing people who are not responsible for what happened here. They are daily being killed by bombs. All right, it's not only the argument about an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, whether you come from the Old Testament or the New Testament. It is an argument that we take that nightly ab-</page><page sequence="12">1 06 Journal of Caribbean Literatures sorption of our fear, we turn on the news at half-past six, and the news is going to tell us that so many people died or so many places were bombed, which would include the deaths of the really innocent (the fact that they came from the place doesn't make them guilty) people who are dying. I don't know that that has entered the American experience of the fear. That fear is still about what could happen to us, right, and never the fear of what we may be doing to them. That fear does not exist. It exists partially in some protests that you've seen. I'm in fear daily living in New York. You think, "If I go to bed tonight, is there going to be a nuclear bomb that wipes everybody out, or if I'm away, is that when my apartment will be gone?" All of these are American fears. But I come from the other side of the world; I come from the side that looks at America for what it is. I've always thought of America as basically benign, and why? Because Americans are very open-hearted, good-hearted people. They don't have ambitions about maintaining an empire abroad and that kind of thing. On the other hand, we, or America have never thought really seriously about the conditions of people who are really poor, and desperate, and exploited, really exploited, by big business abroad. And there's a bafflement about why America is hated. Well it's immaterial. It's really immaterial to wonder why you are hated when you have done so much wrong, or your country, your empire has done so much wrong to people that they have an implacable hatred for what you represent. That hatred is mixed with envy in a way, sure, but on the other hand, what does that mean? Does that mean there can be a change of foreign policy? Well, maybe. Maybe the only thing that is going to really change the idea of a terrorist fear that exists all over the country is not refusing to be cowed into chang- ing its foreign policy, but to realize that when other people die innocently, it's also a horror for them. You see, the egotism of it is that the horror seems to be only ours, but tonight if you were to hear that four hundred women and children were killed by accident, apparently by some bomb that burst somewhere, then I don't think we take that in. We don't. On the other hand, if you are on the receiving end then what you have is some big bully, a frightening bully that can do that thing and not worry about it. So I think that is what might be the good that can come out of that horror. Well, but it seems that the greater the fear on our side, the greater the ten- dency to strengthen our resolve against caring about the horror we inflict on others. What explains that? That is Bush's rhetoric - a cowboy, belligerent, juvenile rhetoric. "I'm going to get you. You can hide in the caves, but I'm going to get you." I mean that is adolescent, that is not statesmanship, that is not global thinking. I mean for a French- man to hear an American getting up and talking that way, he must think, "Well this guy is kind of cowboy idiot." You know what I'm saying? That's not the rhetoric of negotiation. And the rhetoric of understanding, not the enemy, but the understand- ing of what it is you have done to make people get to the point where they do such a horrible act, an act they no longer think is horrible. They think it's an act of war.</page><page sequence="13">Interview with Derek Wale Ott 1 07 They think that it's time they got something. You follow what I'm saying? I think there's a way of talking that has to be in terms of how can you make a peace, a reconciliation, with what is supposed to be the enemy, and what routes can you take. It begins with the attitude, I think, but until that attitude changes, the country is doomed to be in fear, to be paralyzed by fear. Can poetry do anything about that? Yeah. I think it can. I was horrified to find out that the expression of grief that was manifest at its highest in this country was to have a lot of rock stars offer charity, instead of having any one of these people, Julia Roberts, or whoever, re- cite two lines from Emily Dickinson, and give the tragedy some dignity. The dig- nity of America does not consist of six thousand or four thousand people dying and having Britney Spears sing a song. That drove me insane, because I thought surely this is not the best, this is not the height of American thinking. This is not the pain of American sorrow. I mean if I had someone dead in the World Trade Center and your answer to consoling me was to get up and have, I don't care who it is, some rock star singing some bullshit, you know, utter banality. And to think that that represents, that's your moment for poetry, and that's what you give people?! That's what you say about it?! And then you have great tragic poets like, anyone you want, whether it's Whitman or Dickinson or Stevens. That's what could have hap- pened. Of course it will console, because the event that happens in any generation is forgotten. The event is forgotten. The poetry is remembered. And it is perma- nent. Is that because our poetry is now essentially rock music? No, no, no, whoever managed the production ofthat famous stuff insulted the American people again by thinking, "That's what we should give them, because the other stuff, who wants the other stuff?" What do you mean who wants the other stuff? Everybody wants the other stuff. They go to church; they want to hear words of consolation. It's the same thing with poetry. You're singing hymns. It's the same thing with poems. You know the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" is a magnificent poem and people need that, and they get it. Well, they might have recited "And Death shall have no Dominion," right? And so you have one superstar saying, "And Death shall have no Dominion." Then you have some dignity in terms of what you say. But what do you do? No, you get a little event here and there and you say, "Where is poetry?" You get nine poets in a corner reading about something, you know, and then two artists in a corner, but not on the global stage of television. Why? Because the market said, "That's what they want. That's what we've got to give them." So some callous bastards sat down and thought, "What we need is some stars, you know." You know there was a guy here yesterday and we were talking about those banks of telephones where you got stars taking calls. He said you could look at some of them, they were looking at their nails while they were taking calls. And</page><page sequence="14">108 Journal of Caribbean Literatures that's the point. You pledge something and the person is seeing some stars looking at their nails during the pledge. It is incredible that that should have happened because it's saying that mediocrity and basic stupidity is what America is. Now, that is not America. Ultimately, it is not, you know.</page></plain_text>
