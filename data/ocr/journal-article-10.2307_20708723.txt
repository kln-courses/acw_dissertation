Spring 1996. 81-121. ] The Author Responds_ Charles Conti Devotional acts and attitudes include particular habits of respect and submis sion, not only towards God and other spiritual beings, but towards certain of one's fellow-beings as well. ?Peter Donovan Reply to Basil Mitchell and Peter Donovan The professor emeritus has graciously come out of retirement?al though I doubt he ever fully entered into that blissful estate, real or imag ined?to challenge and compliment me in one, all with characteristic ele gance, simplicity, and, of course, conceptual "fit." I wonder, however, if his account of Farrer is not a bit too simple for the purpose. It is clear (a reader remarked) Mitchell does not think Farrer an original thinker. If that is the result of his line of defense, I would regard it as unfortunate. Mitchell might even concur. He is right to locate Farrer in a classical tradi tion, the likes of which we shall probably not see again in any single thinker. However, Mitchell's way of presenting what "counts as" rational argument, leads him necessarily?itself an example of being bullied by a certain style of thinking?to underrate Farrer's real significance. Mitchell writes: "I doubt whether . . . our primary aim should be to quarry them [Farrer's writings] for contributions to our contemporary debates." Leaving aside the historicity of these "contemporary debates"?not without a prece dent, which Farrer's extensive use of Notae Cartesiana suggests and I indi cated?this argument can be turned on its head. The fact that Farrer does not provide any new arguments for theistic belief is precisely a sign of his originality, not lack of it. Such a counter follows the lines of the antifoundational movement this century spearheaded by Wittgenstein, and usually taken as a mark of his philosophical genius. Wittgenstein reminded us of the altogether subtler logic presupposed in natural beliefs. In consequence, we do not have to</page><page sequence="2">82 Charles Conti strive for the "evidence" of other minds, "justify" belief in other minds, argue for the "bridge" of analogy, defeat skepticism by direct confron tation, and so on. Fairer too warned against the "truth-evidentialist's" approach to belief in God, overdoing the justificatory matrix. There is, Mitchell notes, a parallel in the work of William James. Not insignificantly Fergus Kerr, in his book on Theology After Wittgenstein, alludes to James's influence on Wittgenstein. However, I would not describe James, or any of these natural philosophers, as "rational thinkers"; nor even, in James's case, a theologian, as the concluding chapters to Varieties of Religious Experience makes abundantly clear, given his ridicule of "closet" theists and scholastic recidivists. Appreciating the comparison with Wittgenstein meets another issue Mitchell raises, that of change or continuity between "early" and "later" Farrer. Was Wittgenstein, in moving from the Tractatus to Philosophical Investigations, radically reformatting that template of language inherited from Russell's logical atomism, or merely extending his earlier work in subtler, use-oriented ways? In favoring the latter, I am inclined towards Anthony Kenny's view.1 Like Wittgenstein, Farrer did not change that much between "early" and "late," but the changes introduced were pro foundly significant, like dynamite for philosophical theology. That explosive metaphor is indeed contrived; for the sake of defusing Mitchell's criticism of my detonating use of language. I hope that not "every sentence strains for effect," although in writing I did feel a deep obligation, in which Mitchell himself played an important part, to do justice to Farrer's extraordinary prose. He used to say I wrote English the way the Germans speak German. Small consolation; at least he didn't say the way the Germans speak English. One might return the national snub. A visiting German assured me English translations of Freud's style are as sod-heavy and unwitting as the English opinion of German. National stereotypes aside, I would consider it a compliment to write theology the way the Germans think or write, for I find an infinite wealth of richness *See chap. 12, "The Continuity of Wittgenstein's Philosophy," 219ff., esp. 229. Kenny reminds us that Wittgenstein's earliest "Notes on Logic" stress "the bipolar ity of the proposition," conceding true-false commensurability with the facts, im portant in refuting the distinction Proudfoot sets up (see text below) between names and what they designate (Wittgenstein, 183, 195).</page><page sequence="3">The Author Responds 83 in those traditions which do not strive for linear conviction or syllogistic proof in terms of highly stylized debater's prose. I would like to think there was an implicit hermeneutic in my lan guage, and not the obvious one Mitchell's own "way out" expression attests, brushing up against the ineffable in a vain or heroic attempt to grasp the infinite. Language is fluid and evolving with no fixed parameters limiting the stretch of concepts. Nor was I trying?although Fairer did not hesitate to do such a thing early on?to provide a semiotic equivalent for a transcendental argument: to wit, the further "outside" the ordinary and banal, the better for theology. This was the way Farrer used Kant's "thing in-itself ' to allude to the "God's-eye view"; a position modified for a more linguistically sensitive approach in the later work, operating within the con tours of language, ? la Wittgenstein. Nor was Farrer's own use of language without its perils or pitfalls. "Austin wrote Finite and Infinite before he knew how to write," Katherine Farrer said in a characteristic flourish, and I have often had to defend Farrer's illusive use of language as not that, but allusively rich. My penchant for metaphoricity derives from many sources. Those of which I am aware include the fact that I am firmly convinced?indeed, took Farrer as my exemplar?that poetry invites the "open element" in experience, hosts the truth of interpretation. With Paul Ricoeur, I lament the only way philosophy has been able to survive is by eliminating the power of metaphor. Once one has moved beyond the fixed reference points of language, the stable and the statable, language becomes a powerful tool for "world making"; and I agree with Farrer that pictures or images speak a thousand words, maximize "worlds." With images, Farrer resisted those reductionist theories of language prevalent the early part of this century. The Glass of Vision argued that language exists in tension with the reality it creates, even re-creates, the explicative and evaluative functions of lan guage being as important as the indicative or the demonstrative, and proved it by his very style! Farrer's poesy of language offered a moving metaphysic of experience. It allowed theoria to inform praxis. It also shored up his view of theology as enhanced by interpretation, and released a biblical hermeneutic, a typological exegesis which discerns parallels and patterns within the very construction of biblical "accounts." One suspects this encouraged his own extraordinary powers of language. I was after that sort of effect. In light (or darkness) of natural stereotypes, I take some pleasure in Wittgenstein's having credited his emancipation to a Neapolitan</page><page sequence="4">84 Charles Conti with Italianate gestures. Flicking the underneath of the chin with the finger tips to illustrate the very richness of varying symbol systems, Piero Sraffa alerted Wittgenstein to the fallacy of the unum nomen unum nominatum supposition. If you think (he reproached) things exist in a one-to-one relation with the world they reflect, picture-perfect, tell me then, what is the meaning of this? It alerted Wittgenstein to a cultural mouthful. Farrer's use of language was as prismatically rich. And I think one can read him as saying?certainly what I would argue in any case?that theism doesn't have a leg-syllable to stand on if it fails to take account of this polysemous facet of language. God is the highest expression of linguistic form. The levity of that claim, even its gaiety, introduces a life-restoring element to language. It chastens our conventional linguistic practices domi nated too long by material-object reports or mere "paraphrase" when it comes to trying to explain prosody or poetry. Does that mean "God" is a language game, or as gamy as a wild hawk's wing, by which James invited the "open universe" of interpretation? It certainly means "God" the concept is enframed, a language gain. In the apt words of Peter Abbs, "The artist detonates his mind to let in God's."2 So much for "way out" metaphor. In fact, I could not have arranged my own defence better. Henderson and Badham are counterpoints; Donovan balances Mitchell. I delight in Donovan's words (received after I wrote the above): "theological discourse succeeds not by offering a single line of reasoning but by a multidimen sional presentation, a conjuring at many levels with words and tropes." His title "Theology as Rhetoric" is on the mark, right on. Peter senses my metalinguistic purposes to a 'T'rope when he defends my use of theology as construal. This is because I think theology an eager participant in the heights and depths of linguistic resources. Mitchell himself used to say (if memory serves me) he didn't think anyone would understand Farrer if he didn't have a certain sensibility. That requires a soulful slant. Mitchell opines, "Conti's study is not a definitive one." (I would have thought the definite article more appropriate.) In light of his own warning that Farrer ought not to be systematized unduly, one wonders what is being taken from me. To strike an illustrious comparison?the same one Donovan cites?I dared to identify with Farrer's own prefatory remarks in Faith and 2" Artist's Manifesto," in The Angelic Imagination (Brighton: Snake River Press, forthcoming 1996).</page><page sequence="5">The Author Responds 85 Speculation: "I would rather [he wrote] . . . provide materials for an exer cise in understanding, than formalize a chain of argument." I too aimed for "suggestibility," aware that strong "defenses" of theistic belief are both counterproductive?certainly ill-received in my university?and out of date on logical grounds in any case. That raises a moot point. What counts as a "rational" argument or pro vides logical grounds for theism? William Abraham (another student of Mitchell's) has shown the complexity here. He describes the difference between "hard" (Swinburne) and "soft" rationalists (Mitchell). The contrast is that, for "hard" rationalists, if there are reasons?and the presumption is there must be?one is obliged to proffer them. The obligation is strong, a necessary requirement for the defense of theism. For Mitchell, unless one can produce cogent arguments, one may not be able to offer a coherent account. Farrer's position is, to my mind, better because it avoids the oscil lation between "may" and "must." It is actually closer to Wittgenstein's view (which Donovan invites me to comment on) that the very form of argument, including what counts as "reasons" or how "evidence" is obtained, participates in the form-of-life in which it colludes, but precisely by not allowing foreign or alien standards to be imported or dictate terms excessively rational or unhealthily foundational, acknowledging, converse ly, the role of tacit affirmation in the programmatic of belief. This is precisely the issue that exercised William James in "The Will to Believe." Reasoning that knowledge is "justified true belief," philoso phers conclude, rather heavy-handedly, that belief must be a second-rate form of knowledge, shored up by sufficient reasons or?shades of Descartes?rinsed by purgations of plenteous doubt (a near contradiction in terms). One only says "I believe" when one is not in a position to know any better; conversely, only when one is in a position to eliminate skeptical doubt can one say "I know." James did not let leave this skeptical assump tion untested. Knowledge, so conceived, may be in danger of seeking hard evidence in areas where that very seeking is apt to maim or distort findings. (One thinks of that violation of basic trust which comes from putting one's friends to the test or hiring a detective to eliminate the likeli hood of infidelity before marriage? This is a moral culpability not lightly to be dismissed.) James remarked on the logical oddity of conducting one's case in an objective, depersonalized manner. To try to back into the truth by seeking to eliminate error is both psychologically stultifying and likely to prevent the discovery of facts that cannot be ascertained apart from</page><page sequence="6">86 Charles Conti rubbishing skepticism. He spoke of the inappropriateness of making the first commandment in any epistolary of knowledge "Thou shalt never be deceived." Nay, "Thou must have the truth." Skepticism risks the greater loss, since in some areas (such as religion and friendship) our proaffective postures affect the nature of our findings, maximize or minimize results. To extract the moral: seeking is no guarantee of finding, but may be the better part of epistemological discovery. By taking into account the role of dispositional attachment, one is forced to acknowledge the place com mitment plays in uncovering or discovering truth, even creating it. James reminded us that belief running ahead of evidences can sometimes create its own evidence; and in no area is this more the case than the "human sciences" where the art of living depends, in part, on passional, positive commitment. Indeed, on a strict disjunction of knowledge and belief, knowledge may actually be a form of insecure belief; a timid response seeking the evidence of what one is insufficiently prepared to adopt on trust. Seldom does even the "hardened" philosopher (Farrer reminded us) shrink from waltzing the women of his dreams up the aisle for fear of being unable to extract a life time contract; and if one approaches the marriage vows in this manner, as contractual evidence, one has failed to appreciate the part commitment plays in dispensing with that craving for indubiety. I would not describe such arguments as "rational" in any conventional sense of the term. It is closer to what it means to explore the presuppositions involved in being a loving person or a "live-in" partner in this or that dispositional state. (Significantly, Mitchell uses the same expression when explicating Farrer's interest in metaphysical theory "as a philosophical presupposition of revealed religion." He might have left out "revealed" by way of strengthen ing his case for "rational.") James reminded us of the role played by in vestment psychologism (as any teacher or parent knows). An argument from the presuppositions implicit in being a positive believer is analogous to Kant's considerations of the logicoempirical conditions of being a con scious, language-speaking mind, where the weight-bearing reasons belongs to what has to be acknowledged (e.g., the contribution of objects and others or the steadfastness of the world) to explain what we are already. Whether a curb for excessive rationalism or a constructive position in its own right, James and Farrer used such "arguments" to illustrate that theism did not have to subcontract out in "defence" of the faith. To my mind, Farrer, like James, proposed dispositional belief as the antidote to</page><page sequence="7">The Author Responds 87 that form of skepticism one encounters in thin-lipped, rationalistic philosophies. Its logic worked in much the same way Wittgenstein deployed it. To appreciate the subtle form of logic at work in affirming knowledge of others is to put to rest skeptical alternatives and to render unnecessary hard-nosed strategies. Not for nothing did Fairer use a "natural" example. The child who comes to the conviction of other minds has all the evidence for the validity of that belief in the maturation process itself, although (one might add) it is not until one becomes a philosopher, or rather a certain kind of philosopher, one is apt to view such natural acts of nurture as "evidence." On occasion we may have to argue from analogy, putting ourselves in another's shoes?what would / have meant if I had written or said what X did?but, thankfully, we seldom have to live from analogy. By plumbing the depths of natural beliefs, we find the supporting evidences of "pragmatic" faith. These are related to what we have been allowed to become in adhering to such-and-such beliefs. Farrer, like James, realized there is a vital dynamic between faith and evidence. Faith is not without its evidences, but neither does it look for "reasons" as if from some detached, neutral plateau to be judged entirely on impartial grounds. Belief calls for active involvement in the very facts it means to possess; no third-party inspection. Belief does not exist in a one-to-one relation with the evidence on which it is based?that is the old foundational model?because sometimes (as James twigged the faith vetoers) it is only by suspending disbelief that one can prepare for that voluntary "lending" that allows us to realize the truth of participation in a form-of-life?of which dependency, fidelity, and commitment are the con stitutive ingredients. This participatory pose does not deny confirmation. Prevenient faith realizes the importance of subsequent evidence. But it also reminds us that certain types of knowledge require appropriate means. Locke's principle of economy advises we should always trim faith to its evidences. What about (Farrer retorted) when faith helps to create its evidences? When faith in a fact can help create that fact (James chimed in), it is one's moral bounden duty not to withhold support, "to wait for the bell." Lest it be thought I am presenting Farrer as a Wittgensteinian fideist, let me remind the reader how he balanced the account between faith and its evidences in Saving Belief Faith does not substitute for evidence, but may put one in a position to receive any evidence, any evidence (James would add) that comes from not looking for only a specific kind of evi</page><page sequence="8">88 Charles Conti dence on supposedly presuppositionless grounds. The result is not unlike Mitchell's advocacy of neutrality and commitment, save the natural attach ments to the latter render the former logically impossible (or difficult to "weight" in anything like equal, judicious amounts). Commitment helps us reevaluate what "counts as" evidence, even overlooks recalcitrant evidence, although it is certainly amenable to evidence. This is stronger than using faith in a "garbage collector's role," to clear away outmoded burdens of proof, but to enhance the favorable "landing conditions" for the reception of truth. To move away from the "grounding" of belief the way Wittgenstein did is not to fail to appreciate (a) the need to argue why this movement is itself a vital or viable expression of natural beliefs, nor (b) to fail to recog nize that this very form of natural argument "regrounds" one's life in sig nificant practical consequences, even pastoral concerns (as Donovan points out). The validity of pragmatism depends precisely on the presuppositions being adhered to; which presuppositions, unpacked, provide the most natural line of argument, de facto rather than de jure. Farrer did not fail to provide examples of this "practical" form of effi cacious belief, from the same area as did Wittgenstein, the analogy of other minds. The movement away from the venerable doctrine of analogy in affirming others is by way of realizing what is already presupposed in being a mind oneself. To be a mind is to have already entered into commerce with other minds (a point Badham reiterates, see below). The existence presupposition is, accordingly, part and parcel of that form of life in which we participate. Our capacity to think comes from never having doubted the validity of nurturing "others." In this way Farrer subsumed the "bald" existence question in a dispositional response. Despite this realignment of "rational" with "pragmatic," Mitchell is right to distinguish Farrer from Richard Swinburne's purely metaphysical approach. I think the contrast needs to be pushed further however. There is no obvious confirmation of a "personal" reality behind nature or (as Bad ham reminds us) from "nature naturing." It is this natural vitalism which process thinkers exploit, just to point to a large area where I disagree with "processual" arguments about the "worlding" of nature. Farrer undoubtedly had a theology of nature, but it was reached by backward or retroductive inference from acts of personal providence. The God of nature is logically dependent on the God of grace. If the God of you and me, then also the God of nature from which we have emerged. As he put it in his revised</page><page sequence="9">The Author Responds 89 preface to the second edition of Finite and Infinite: "Unless ... a general and sovereign Providence makes sense, the link is cut between life and creationist belief, and the investigation of that belief appears superfluous" (viii). This is not only related to the wisdom of not trying to refute Kant's argument in the Critique of Judgement and Hume's argument in the Dialogues?that the origination of nature bears no parallel to any causality we know of; that cause-effect relations hold only within the framework of nature?it is also related to the circular nature of arguments from "impar tial" nature. Mitchell credits me with correctly identifying the shape of Fairer's early argument but adds, "It is hard to see what makes him think it is circular." Prior to the sentence quoted, I explained the nature of this "circularity." On the premises laid out in Finite and Infinite?where "All our rational knowledge of God reduces ... to the knowledge of such a being as is the creative agent of effects" (FI, 61; cf. 4)?we cannot pre sume God is an "agent" without identifiable acts; but (as I went on to ex plain) the "act" of a divine agent must be the paradigm case of what is notoriously difficult to define, especially on personalist premises, where "the subject" is heavily dependent on the descriptive means, some predicativity. In theology one simply doesn't have the subject of God apart from the predicate of imputed effects; why Ian Crombie, Gilbert Ryle, and others regard the concept "God" as a disguised predicate. Mitchell writes, "If one employs 'cosmological inference' in the manner, for example, of Swinburne, to a divine creator who is personal, one is then in a position to look for his acts in the created order." This "if is a bit thin on the ground, speaking cosmologically, that is, metaphysically "iffy." We cannot presume God "exists" or is even an "agent" (whether of creation, redemption, or providence) without identifiable acts, predicates that are taken as uniquely "belonging" to this being called God. But these "acts" are hardly ordinary, identifiable acts, since one simply doesn't have that kind of agent apart from such "acts," which "acts" are supplementary interpretations of "natural events," so turn on the validity of the very postulate one is trying to prove, that there is an "agent" who "acts" in this "divine" way. Can we get such specific, identifiable acts from wholescale creation? Unlikely. The worse for theology (or the better) when "divine acts" do not contravene nature or are so perfectly in accord with natural events that Farrer could say (as he often did) "the hand of God is perfectly hidden." His cosmological scruple in Finite and Infinite served to remind</page><page sequence="10">90 Charles Conti us that nature does not provide a descriptive model of "divine acts." One cannot draw a providentialist conclusion from impersonal nature "red in tooth and claw." As predicates go, providence and grace are more suggestive. Creation ex nihilo offers (to some) originative thinking?old fashioned "production ontology"?whereas God comes sensible au coeur, slips quietly into the human heart. I was trying to explain Farrer's way of breaking out of the "vicious circle" into an informative one, thereby increasing the reference-range of our concepts. How one "knows" God is personal or a Creator is, admitted ly, from acts of creativity, especially providence-in-action, which is the existential meaning of creation. But one would hardly conclude to that out standing act of creativity apart from the prior notion of a Creator (other wise, all naturalists would be theists). And one does not arrive at that per sonal conviction, of a loving God, by "raking the universe for signs of a First Cause" (as Farrer said at the outset of Faith and Speculation). We find it "absurd"?his word?that anyone should pretend to discount the "fact and form" of religious belief?the Wittgensteinian starting point in Faith and Speculation?while conducting an "impartial" analysis of the world, looking for hints of that Creator scattered or particularized in rocks and frills. Finite and Infinite equally slated the futility of trying to produce "the rabbit of theistic proof from the hat of impartial cosmology." "We work up an insoluble antithesis, we fence round a lacuna of explanation, bang goes the pistol, and therefore, we say, God!" (FI, 6). Eventually Farrer found a way of strengthening the "religious" conviction to a "first cause" in the philosophy of action, to a Creator who "acts" like an agent of renewal. Here we see one of the advantages in employing a theology of "affirmative action" to make up for that lack of "cosmic signposting" one does not get from nature. Agreed then, one should not quarry Farrer for new arguments. But one should recognize the way he used the faith-presupposition to "philoso phize" theology. It broaches on the near revelatory, a new and exciting way of thinking. It is both revolutionary for philosophical theism and a highly original move in theology. I think Farrer can be brought out of the cobwebs by recognizing the way he brought theology out of its rationalist doldrums. Farrer's model was "faith balanced by a luminous philosophical wisdom," where the luminosity of that wisdom still had plenty of work to do. But the beauty of Farrer's (or my) metaphysical personalism is that one can broach the</page><page sequence="11">The Author Responds 91 "truths" of religion from either personalist or theological premises. Hope fully that answers Donovan's question: To whom addressed? He is a shrewd reader. A long chapter, eliminated in the interests of brevity, dealt with these Wittgensteinian themes more fully. As Wittgen stein called our attention to the premise of "otherness" in the very fact of consciousness as interfaced?not only in analyzing the structure of lan guage but manifest in culture and community (as Sraffa pointed out)?so Farrer reminded us that it is by "mediated divine initiatives" the believer is brought into the presence of God. Such a being is not entirely Wholly Other, indeed, cannot be?by presumption of intimacy and need for con ceivability. That this ingrafting does not follow the lines of a "spiritual science" or strict causal inference "from creature to Creator" is no detri ment to the sense of an Abiding Other at the root of consciousness. Alteri ty is a profoundly useful concept to persons and to spirituality. What Don ovan calls "the pragmatic underside of theology" comes through the experi ence of grace as infused presence. This is another of the advantages of sub stituting dynamic concepts for static ones. Grace offers a sense of natural "copresence," a munificent and possibly divine presentiment of God. Peter is unsure that there is room for interreligious dialogue even if Christology is approached metaphysically. I think this must be the case for any religion that recognizes the need to put "God'-symbols in concrete form, honoring the "way of manifestation" or via manifestissima. God is not Wholly Other, but holy otherness, a dyadicism one finds in all the great religions (which has prophets, spokespersons, or exemplars to convey the truth of their message). I wonder how Peter would respond to this startling suggestion of Farrer's (discussed at length in that missing chapter) that "In morality there is a Christ-factor before there was Christ." "Outside" Christ is still within a saving remnant of moral sensibility, by which we may become sacramentally aware of "the other." As regards my alleged view that Farrer is "fighting a losing battle with process theologians," I am happy to report (pending publication of my next project, a three-way debate between Henderson, Griffin, and myself) Farrerians may live to fight another day, even find me as their "corner man." It is because I have not identified Farrer's version of theism with scholasticism or process revisionism simply that I insist there are not only two alternatives open to the philosophical theologian. My prevailing "sin," according to the process spokesperson David Griffin, is that I have done precisely what Mitchell suggests, attempted a via media between revision</page><page sequence="12">92 Charles Conti ary metaphysics and more staid versions of classical theism. Griffin would like to present Fairer as a traditional theist, all the better to deconstruct him with. Henderson doggedly holds to traditional formulae. In that debate, I worked very hard to disassociate Farrer from both extremes; and judging from Henderson's response herein, I seemed to have had a little success. He earnestly bids readers, on my behalf, not to write my Farrer off as a process theologian. Deo exultate! (I'm sure there is an Italian gesture to express the relief.) Reply to Edward Henderson There is, however, still more convincing to come, and I am happy to have this final opportunity. (It is relevant to one of Mitchell's more winsome remarks, where he himself, for shame, can be seen playing with words.) Mitchell writes, "It is for reasons such as these [the retainer of transcendence] that. . . Conti rightly points out, 'And yet even in that final book Farrer held out for a divine overplus intrinsic to the life of God.' " Mitchell tweaks: "And yet that 'And yet' rather suggests that Conti regards this as a piece of somewhat puzzling obstinacy on Fairer's part." Not quite; the point of my "and yet" was not to swim against the tide of the natural implications?"Oh Austin, how could you!"?but to qualify for the sake of dramatic effect, not dramatic repudiation. My "And yet" was a coda. There is something worth noticing about the oddity of the style of argument by which Farrer adhered to transcen dentalism, so nota bene. (Those who accuse me of making Farrer into a process thinker are completely unwitting here, simply unable to appreciate how the inference to transcendence in agency comes about.) The surprise element works this way. If one understands the way the "owner-I" is called into play in intentional activity, by "overseeing" its acts from an involved standpoint, as a moral-monitor self; and if we grant (as Fairer did) the im portance of voluntarist premises in theology, which calls for some modus operandi for that grand operator called "God" (a point Mitchell himself concedes), it seems that a similar form of "concrescence" is required for the being whose esse is conceived as operari or activity. "And yet" (reader beware) despite Farrer's wzbegrudgingly acceptance of the importance of finding God in the concrete mode, and despite his concession to the unten ableness of the divine "in-it-selfness" of traditional theism, Farrer showed, not a puzzling obstinacy, but an emphatic or loyal allegiance that I found well worth explaining, especially since it seems to run against the gamut</page><page sequence="13">The Author Responds 93 of concretized agency so vital to his pragmatic reform. My intention was to arrest the reader, to convey mild incredulity, not strong qualification, the same arrest as was expressed in the concluding chapters of Faith and Speculation where Farrer's position on process theology was qualification, not dismissal. No process grumble. Its logic worked like this. Despite his revolutionary understanding of voluntarism in metaphysics, we, the readers, stand corrected in our bald consequentialist expectations. We are emphati cally not left with only a behaviourist deity on activist premises (as Farrer feared was the result of process revisionism). Despite, that is, what naturally or normally appears to require an equivalent of embodiment in theology (as Mitchell concedes), Farrer was not prepared either to concede the need for strict embodiment or strongly entailed acts as any necessary implication of consequentialist thinking. To the contrary, he held out for a divine overplus. And why??because he did not think the influence of identifying God as "soul" of the world was "wholly benign" (as Mitchell says I say). In fact, he deemed it dangerously reductive, as I do, and he was even prepared to run the risk of violating his own agency-thinking to resist that consequence of consequentialism?that "the God of Mighty Acts" equals sheer consequences. That is no more acceptable in the theological realm than that persons are the additive sum of acts in the finite arena (I said ad nauseam and on behalf of ad infinitum arguments against the process reduction). The "and yet" was a "despite" clause, not a spite clause. Despite consequentialism, and despite voluntarism, and despite all the concrete implications established by agency-thinking, Farrer denied the effect of aligning God entirely with effects. "And yet" I am at a "perfect" loss why Henderson and Mitchell fail to see the obvious importance of importuned acts, deeded Acts by which we "deduce" God. To appreciate why, and how, Farrer did not go "all the way" with the process methodology, using instead The Freedom of the Will to record both sides of the consciousness/consequentialist divide, is absolutely fundamen tal to the metaphysical deportment of his and my case against process. But what is the status of the inference to "overmind'? Here the differ ences between Mitchell and myself begin to disappear, while those with Henderson and myself seem to still carry on. Mitchell reasons: "a transcen dent God could not function adequately either as the agent-cause of the universe or as the proper object of worship if he were limited by physical constraints." Leaving off the question whether physical constraints act an impediment or a facilitator of any "agent-cause," one sees in Mitchell's</page><page sequence="14">94 Charles Conti words a form of inference that Farrer himself employed in Faith and Speculation. A theology of transcendence (he wrote in the summary of the argument) receives "negative support" by virtue of the inhospitality of the world to fully house the divine intentions. "One might think that a theology of Will called for a metaphysic of immanence. But transcenden talism receives negative support from the inhospitality of the world we know towards a world-soul theology" (FS, 175). Now "negative support" is hardly bumptious inference, even less a bio graphical commentary on the life of God in itself, and emphatically not some sort of explanation to lesser mortals why the Absolute Being of "platonic" perfection did not have to create, relate, or do anything to be God, nevertheless did, out of grudging condescension or compassionate declension. Negative support does not embolden an unconditional denial of all finite constraints. It is rather (as Mitchell himself suggests) explanation seeking the full possibility of effect, a mild reductio argument. It is the personal analogy (as Mitchell deftly puts it) "appropriately modified ... to perform its explanatory function." It is the deo volente of "God willing," by which we, humbly, do not take all the credit for what comes to pass. "Farrer's reasons (Mitchell writes) for his insistence on God's transcendence were basically theological." I agree. But the support ing premises were entirely philosophical. As persons are not the simple sum of their activity, so too God of this or any world begun. Traditional theists are undoubtedly entitled to conduce to full agency of effect from personalist premises, especially if they are voluntarists. But this inference, I hasten to add, leads to God in the "over-mode," not God in the abstract mode. From the wcwequivalence of God and world, the negative condition, we do not reach the independent path of God's absolutely detached utter priority; rather, we attain the effectiveness of agency, the God "of concrete effects?God in the genitive case, as the subject of'tis activities. Voluntarists may conclude to God's "ontological priority," especially if they still crave a sufficient explanation for the world, or (as I do not) think it can be found in totalizing mythology; but the ontology of this logically prior being, as I took pains to explain, is dependent on God's subsequent "becoming," apart from which Farrer categorically said we should know nothing of God. The fact that the ordo cognoscendi reverses the ordo essendi changes the status of the cosmologi cal inference, drastically. "No God about which we can only think" amounts to the denial of a priori argumentation in theo-ontology. It is to</page><page sequence="15">The Author Responds 95 take the way of incarnate acts or to adopt a "bottom-up" route of sugges tive agency, and refuse to stop until one reached full consciousness of affect. This provides an analogy for chaste transcendence. The difference is that, with us, embodied activity comes first, and then we are blessed with self-consciousness; that "monitor-self Fairer charged with such "high" moral responsibilities in The Freedom of the Will. We "overview" our acts, usually in the very course of enacting them. The free will thus guides the teleological self in the course of experiencing itself. In other words, once consciousness comes into being, being precedes becoming; whereas with God one can only assume, if God, then prior to what is dependent for its becoming to be. Is there anything (I ask) in my "bottom-up" account that prevents one from thinking the consciousness of God comes ready equipped to its task? There is everything to the contrary, given the accession of consciousness "to the throne," a metaphor that firmly places the "owner-I" in control of its acts. What about the process account of "embedded" explanations, no extracurricular activity on the part of God? Is it sufficient to defeat the pre sumption of governing mind? Process metaphysicians reason "no actualities apart from other actualities themselves in the process of becoming." This ostensibly avoids "outside-in" causality, that is, outdated causation models. Pushed to its logical extreme, God and world are entangled in the web of Creativity. Farrer reckoned that forfeits the God who acts as "overlord" of its acts. I agree. Of the two errors, equating God to a force within the process, or allowing for a consciousness-factor responsible for the process, he preferred the latter, even if that fails to explain how God's mind became conscious in the first place. Basil suggests this is where the analogy breaks down. I am not sure we need to cave in that easily. For those who recognize the holism of mind body agency?the fact that both an esse of planning and an operari of execution are required by acts of creativity?one way to draw putative God closer to the expression of its acts is by honoring embodiment motifs in theology, avoiding conceiving act in a vacuum while also avoiding the idea of creatio ex nihilo, out of "sheer nothing," an idea fraught with cosmo gonie and philosophical problems. Farrer speculated on how the "act" of divine extension was consistent with the interiority of "love" experienced in the trinity. That goes some way towards resisting the idea of utterly independent acts. In the idea of trinity, the consciousness of God is honed</page><page sequence="16">96 Charles Conti to social perfection (or begins to acknowledge Proudfoot's "social" call, as discussed below). In my voluntarist treatment of activist premises in Metaphysical Per sonalism, I wanted to concede the process anchor?the need for concres cence was, in any case, entirely consistent with Farrer's esse est operari formula?"and y ;t" I felt obliged to explain why Farrer didn't go all the way with process categories, "God-and-world" in one embrace, hence equi primordial with natural causes. I argued it isn't enough to equate "being" with "becoming" in the sense of Sartre's adage, "You are what you do, no more." By dramatic arrest, I intended to help "out-and-out" transcendental ists appreciate why Farrer "held out for an overplus," even against the grain of his own voluntarism. "And yet" it wasn't against the grain, not really. For in light of the added emphasis Farrer placed on the logical con currence between "being" and "activity" in the later work, Farrer's loyalty to God as "overlord" of Creation is remarkably consistent with consequent ialist motifs in theology, and precisely what distinguishes his use of the person-model from Whitehead's creative cataloguing of natural processes, "God, or call it Creativity." Farrer did not, as Griffin, have to invent a neo logism "God-and-a-world" to avoid the embarrassment of resorting to cate gories lying "outside" nature. Why??because consciousness is itself a transcendent aspect of persons; and if we use that model to conceive God, transcendence is on a continuum with immanent acts; the more so the being we call "God" who engages us with and by its acts, the being qua becoming. "And yet" I seemed to have failed utterly to convey the fascina tion this passage held for me: how the transcendent ego has its counterpart in theology; how Farrer adapted the conscious-factor of The Freedom of the Will as well as the propriety of "the project" for uniting both the sub ject and predicate of agency. So let me repeat my warning: a mild reductio argument does not make absolute independence necessary or possible. We get to God's ontic priority from activist premises. If theists fail to recog nize this, it is not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob they worship, only Anselm's Deity. These differences are, I hope, clearer in my debate with Griffin. But a careful reading of Metaphysical Personalism confirms that neither I nor Farrer sold out to process categories. Farrer was a personalist metaphysi cian; and although in that book I was trying to explain why Farrer took Hartshorne's challenge seriously, I took great care to show how much better, philosophically speaking, person categories are to the historic claims</page><page sequence="17">The Author Responds 97 of Christianity. Badham picked this up, contrasting Farrer's "concrescent" Christ with Hartshorne, "for whom the Christ-event has little purchase." In Reconceptualizing God (as our three-way conversation has been tentatively titled), I carry the personalist challenge directly into the process camp, accusing Whiteheadians of needing more intentionalist implications in the "processual" account of Nature. Nevertheless, as I was keen to point out in this book (by way of explaining Farrer's own philosophical evolution) Faith and Speculation certainly used the stimulus of process theology to make important changes in philosophical method. The "purged leaven" (which Henderson has no trouble grasping) is related to Farrer's confession of "having received rational theology in an Aristotelian garb" in Finite and Infinite (247). It had to do with the form dictating implications of substance/accident thinking. This involved taking essentia as the determining aspect of real existence, using perfection as the principle attribute of the divine existence, treating the essence/existence dis tinction as the foundation of the rational/revealed distinction, using analogy to make up the difference between describing God "in the world" and God "in itself." I suggested that principles of hyperbolical attribution usually associated with the older metaphysics of "being" convey little of the divine reality. I argued that the traditional Greek concept of immutable perfection fails to express the "religious" idea of God as compassionately involved with its creation (a point Mitchell himself makes with some compassion, in the example of his friend, the polio victim). Let me make Farrer's "purge" as plain as propositional cats. For for malism Farrer substituted voluntarist concepts; for essentia he substituted activity; for perfection he substituted perfectibility or moral aspiration; for the life of God in itself he substituted the activity of God. All these, as Basil rightly points out, were never scholastic crimes committed in the un critical sense a radical revision suggests. Indeed, that is why I worked hard to show the basic continuity between "early" and "later" Farrer. But I accepted, as I believe did Farrer, Hartshorne's summary statement as a working hypothesis of what needed to be purged from theology. Since we are no longer Greeks in philosophy?using substance/accident attributions; citing the potential over the actual; regarding change as imperfection; putting being before becoming; treating essence as prior to existence?we should no longer be Greeks in theology (see MP, 259-60). How much redeployment of personal metaphysics this calls for is ir dispute between myself and Henderson. He has, I fear, a tendency to cast me in the role of</page><page sequence="18">98 Charles Conti the philosophical free spirit, into that outer darkness from which "theology of creation" did not emanate. God's breath of presence, as told in Genesis, moved over the face of the waters, cradle of life, and came f?ll circle in Revelation, as "a pure river of water of life." It is, of course, entirely possible (as others have suggested, like Tom Tracy) that Farrer didn't com plete the reform during his lifetime and he too needs a little help from his friends. The early Farrer, by his own account, "compromised" between formal ism and voluntarism, that is, he portrayed God using the former language, and persons using the latter. This produced a strain on the logical gram mars by which these two terms, "finite" and "Infinite," were supposed to provide an intellectual springboard for theistic reflection, so sacrificed the principle of correlation by which the natural mind was supposed to infer naturally "the things of the spirit." In the later work, Farrer went all the way" with voluntarism. It had some fascinating effects for "deconstructing" traditional theology and reconstructing a modern strand of theism. Finite and Infinite engaged with Logical Positivism in a similar alterca tion. It hardly made Farrer an analytic philosopher simpliciter, although linguistic analysis doubtless taught him the lesson of ordinary language, and helped purge the arcane concepts from the scholasticism of Finite and Infinite, no longer dependent on substance-attributions, form, essence, and the absolutivity of Being. I see no reason why, an equivalent confrontation, making adjustments to the divine "in-itselfiiess, makes Farrer a process the ologian. Perhaps a personal anecdote helps. After canvassing Farrer's friends to no avail, I asked Katherine Farrer for some clue to Faith and Speculation. She replied, "Austin wrote it for his American friends"?those who alerted him to the process challenge. But it was written in the form of a contretemps. And even those exemplars cited?John Lucas and Richard Swinburne, to which one can add the distinguished names of Anthony Kenny, Keith Ward, Maurice Wiles, and Peter Geach?revise some of the traditional predicates along lines similar to that of process thinkers. If anything, Swinburne seems to have capitulated even more decisively than Farrer, if one insists on posing neoclassical metaphysics as the adversary of traditional theism.3 But revisions are necessary. 3See The Coherence of Theism (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) 97, 210, for Swinburne's qualifications to the way "omnipotent" and "omniscient" are under stood. Finding a similar incongruity in the notion of omnipotence, Peter Geach</page><page sequence="19">The Author Responds 99 However, not to dull an important issue, I think Farrer was in danger of violating his own empirical mandate when he suggested "the world need (reviewing Farrer's The Freedom of the Will) wrote: "Pace Pope and Leibniz, we must surely hold it an impossible feat even for Omnipotence to leave free the human will while 'binding Nature fast in fact' " {Philosophical Review 75 [1966]: 100; see also "Omnipotence, Creation, Perfection: Kenny and Aquinas on the Power and Action of God," in Modern Theology 1/2 [1985]: 104-17). In part two of his book "A Contingent God," Swinburne ostensibly defends the claim that "there exists eternally an omnipresent spirit, free, creator of the uni verse, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and a source of moral obligation," but makes some interesting "process" adjustments to the traditional conception of God. Regarding divine immutability, he writes: "That God is completely change less would seem to be for the theist an unnecessary dogma" (215). Accordingly, Swinburne rejects the doctrine of God's timelessness as the unnecessary corollary of divine immutability. His reasons are quite similar to those cited by process theologians: (1) it is more the legacy of Neoplatonism and less implied in Scripture (217); (2) it is out of keeping with current attitudes of personal identity: we do not feel that age, decay, and temporality means a person is "continually losing parts of existence all the while" (219); (3) it is the misleading Aristotelian legacy of the idea that God is "pure act," indeed, the "one pure act"; therefore God should betray no unactualized potency (n. 222). Regarding the latter, Swinburne considers the Thomist conception of fullness of perfection because (as Thomas reckoned, but Swinburne rejects) the obverse im plies God gains something through change, so was less than perfect to begin with. "[A]n obvious answer to this point is to suggest that the perfection of a perfect being might consist not in its being in a certain static condition, but in being in a certain process of change" (215, italics added). That is precisely the contention of Hartshorne's process solution, a God whose "self-surpassing perfection" becomes more perfect in taking contingencies into itself, i.e., a self-surpassing surpasser. Drawing further on the language of process metaphysics, Swinburne recog nizes that, for Hegel, "God was essentially something in process" and, in a similar vein, recognizes that "complete temporality" in Barth's theology (218) threatens the idea of God as "altogether unchangeable." He concedes that God's life must be enriched by God's act in creating; otherwise, "If God has thus fixed his inten tions 'from all eternity,' he would be a very lifeless thing; not a person who reacts to men [sic] with sympathy or anger, pardon or chastening because he chooses to there and then" (214). However, Swinburne pulls back on the concrete require ment: "being creator of the universe . . . does not entail the existence of our uni verse or any other universe" (224). It does from the point of providing grounds for making that claim.</page><page sequence="20">100 Charles Conti never have been." Strictly, one doesn't know this on voluntarist premises, and can't. However, if there was any unrepentant traditionalism in Farrer, it showed itself more in philosophical stubbornness than theological conservatism (which he never was). That is because Farrer preferred to err on the side of ineffableness in preserving the very concept "God" than lower the standards of conceivability, equals "the soul of the world." The point of taking a personalistic approach to transcendence is that one does not have to make it "either/or." One can arrive at a sufficient sense of transcendence from either philosophical or theological grounds. It is the status of the inference to transcendence that separates Ed and myself. The inference from voluntarism does not quite allow God's "self sufficient independence from the world" as a metaphysical first principle (a point which he now concedes) but only as a consequence of tending to consequences engendered or explained. But how does God "tend" to world; and from how high a platform of detached involvement? Not so high, is my reply, to impair the inference. The cosmological schema offered God as "cause" of world, because world is "seen" (interpreted) as the "effect" of God. This "bottom-up" inference can yield the transcendent agent of effect, but only and because it does not stop until it reaches full conse quence of affect. It is the affective "I" of effective causality which yields the conclusion "agent-God." Let me put it another way. If (as Farrer said) every theist is bound to think God with whatever qualifications as the "mind of the world," and if this conception of God is to be done on voluntaristic conditions and not on a priori premises, how (we ask) do we arrive at God's "prior actuality? In short, by not reducing God to the sum total of divine acts. There is a precedent for this in moral agency?the "owner-I" who controls its acts. The status of "prior actuality" is equivalent to not reducing persons to the sum of their activity. Neither, of course, should we allow the cogitatio of detached contemplation. We need both cogitare and ago to infer genuine agency. Thinking is a forum for action, or thought in action. Henderson's contrast between "high" and "low" transcendence is not entirely helpful. All we need, logically, is sufficient transcendence to indemnify the agent "of." This is because action is both a necessary pre condition of identifying any X and a sufficient condition when it identifies "who did what." This sense of transcendence doesn't allow bumptious inferences, those which bedevil theology and discredit it in the eyes of opponents. Even philosophers unhostile to theology feel that "trinity is</page><page sequence="21">The Author Responds 101 Christianity's most exuberant adventure in the incomprehensible."4 Clearly "prior actuality" is not an empirical hypothesis in the sense that it is the identifying mark of ordinary agents; "and yet" (as I tried to alert the reader) Farrer adhered to it. And why??because, without it, we reduce the idea of God to material absurdity, "God, or call it Nature." (Farrer was keen to reclaim his personalist origins.) Also because the agency model allows us to think "from" acts "to" full consciousness of effect. Finally, Farrer was that concerned, yes, even against the natural grain of his own voluntarist thinking, to distinguish himself from process reductionism. But there are liabilities in conceiving "top-down" causality, not only because the natural place setting of "acts" as in the world seems to imply some form of embodiment (as Basil concedes), but because out-and-out transcendence conduces to that mythology which presumes to think "from the God's-eye view," from the origin of things, "from scratch," whereas Finite and Infinite had argued we can only realize God as the "agent of effect." Since God is not an instance of a type of being already elsewhere experienced, The description we give ourselves of Him cannot (with any justification) be independent of the ground on which we propose to believe in Him, viz., the function He performs for all the fin?tes. He must be understood as the Agent of this very effect. If our predecessors have not grasped this function [of the indispensability of predicativity or, in the process lingo, God as the "concres cence" of effect] they have not known God at all. (FI,4) The Freedom of the Will concretized this God of effect in terms of affec tive agency. Faith and Speculation "cashed it in" in terms of "pragmatic" theology, agency involved. From this we infer the reality of God, as an active will. This is, I submit, a very clever use of consequentialist thinking to sub stantiate the "causeological" reality of God on inferential premises, com mon to our involvement with others. God is indissolubly linked to an epis temology of action, satisfying both the God of faith and the God of the philosophers. Consequentialism pioneers a concrete sense of prior causal ity. An entirely independent "prior actuality" is too abstract by comparison. But Farrer's God was not so high as to fail to detect what looks like a prima facie inconsistency in the process account, whose God seems to lack 4William Barrett, The Illusion of Technique, 299.</page><page sequence="22">102 Charles Conti full-blooded agency of affect, since reputedly "deficient" in the primordial mode.5 Whiteheadians protest against this reading as a misreading, but Whitehead's infelicitous division between God in the primordial mode and God in the consequent mode does little to assuage critics. Farrer's God, of the affectivity of effectivity, is more holistically derived from the causa agens of natural acts. It allows for the implication of derivation. No God sans some doing; no doing without a Doer. But why, I ask myself, when we have so much in common and either is prepared to travel half way around the world to be in each other's com pany, and why when we have the pleasure of each other's company, do we talk warmly, profitably, in harmony, and without noticeable disagreement about Farrer and philosophical theology, does Henderson think I say things which "light a fire of dissent" and which I do not even recognize as my position? Is Ed's orality that much more compelling than the nuances of his written word? And is my written treatise that opaque? Do I really proffer the assertorie "We must think of God this way and not that'? Do I scupper the whole kit and caboodle of traditional affirmations which I see myself as working hard to redefine on more viable philosophical premises such as voluntarism which we both share? Do I really have a stake in defending theology, let alone "my view"? Do I really dare say what God's "needs" are: that "God is because of a world" or "because of creatures"? Whereas traditionalists absolutize Absolutivity, do I absolutize relativities, as process theologians undoubtedly do? Do I really say God "cannot be said to exist. . . apart from involvement with a world of creatures," or just insist that "exists" is not the sort of predicate one can tie to the concept perfection by God's apron strings, because it hangs onto the skirt of agency-attributions for dear life, a maternal metaphor I refuse to abandon given its importance to person-concepts. 5Whitehead writes: "The consequent nature of God is the fulfillment of His ex perience by His reception of the multiple freedom of actuality into the harmony of his own actualization. It is God as really actual completing the deficiency of His mere conceptual actuality" {Process and Reality, 400). It is not clear whether God's "consequent" nature provides material compatible with the pr?existent divine harmony, or whether the deficiency implies an additive indispensable to complete the divine primordiality, therefore initially ontological deficient since devoid of acts. The first is compatible with Farrer's position; the second he cate gorically denied in "The Prior Actuality of God." Religious instincts point to the opposite conclusion, of the completeness of God apart from creation.</page><page sequence="23">The Author Responds 103 Having expended as much energy as I have in our recent debate show ing these are caricatures of my position, I can do no better than direct readers to that book for a fuller account of why the answer to all these questions is "No." However, I thank Ed for his attempt to be fair, even helping me against imperceptive critics, and conceding many of my points. The symbiosis is so complete that, the longer we go on in this conversa tion, the harder it is for me to distinguish between us. However, it seems to me he only clears room for his protestation by overstating my position in language, importantly, I do not normally speak. Here we have a living example of Donovan's claim that shared language offers "broader com municative possibilities." This is because we are undoubtedly social beings, in need of nurture and a community of shared ideas. In Donovan's apt words, To sustain plausibility ... a theological rhetoric in personalist terms requires engagement with a practicing constituency, a community of persons immersed in a particular way of living, the social structures and dynamics of which are intimately connected with their beliefs, their habits and their words. But the same principle?of engagement?holds true for God. And it seems that when our view of nature and personal identity changes, the logical grammar of "God" changes with it. A new physics requires a new meta physics; equally, a revitalized conception of God to underwrite it. But this concept of God is as old as the concept of person, what it means to be a living soul. It is at one with the Being who "acts" in the lives of persons. This calls for revision to the static attributes that belong to the older meta physics which Farrer rejected; and that, in turn, calls for a different use of language, less assertorie, more poetic, and more exploratory. I sense a greater reluctance in Henderson to revise theological language than myself, and suspect it has more to do with our respective psycho logies than theology. At the same time, I appreciate Mitchell's conservative point, that the best way to make a good rebel is by offering a strong tradition. I don't doubt that, with sufficient nuance, one might upgrade the ancient formulae?so much of theology seems just that, a salvage operation?and while I do not wish to be seen as denying Henderson's mainstays of traditional theism, indeed cherish our friendship for the gravi ty it offers, I would also think it "exceedingly odd" if when our theistic metaphysic changes, forcing significant alterations upon us (like unalter ability for "changelessness" or "immutability"), some metaphysical</page><page sequence="24">104 Charles Conti dogmas, old trees, didn't topple with it. Theological doctrines are never sacrosanct. "The refinement never ceases," Farrer admonished. Theology is no exact science, only the art of enlightened ignorance, as Ian Crombie put it. That requires fresh saplings. Henderson's holdouts, of "self-sufficiency," "perfection," and its corre lative notion of "condescension," "creation ex nihilo" and "independent prior actuality," are, to my mind, notions more at home with an outdated metaphysic, and, if adhered to uncritically (which he is aware of), are in danger of underselling Farrer's special contribution to the contemporary debate. Farrer had a unique ability to think creatively within the tradition; his was a most original mind. And I hoped that would come across to un original minds, whether traditional theists or process revisionists. There is, perhaps, another explanation for our persistent disagreement (which has become more obvious to me over the years). I am not com posing constructive theology; I am only writing a corrective to theology, even "negative theology." I want to deconstruct theology, as Farrer himself so brilliantly exampled, in order to rein in its speculative excesses and in order to, profitably, allow for positive reconstruction. Perhaps that doesn't pay sufficient homage to traditional dogmas, or remakes Farrer. On the other hand, possibly why traditional critics like Henderson and Mitchell overstate my position is because they impute to theology the sort of propo sitional fidelity neither my use of language nor Farrer's understanding of theology necessitates. I think it is also fair to say?which I would feel much less inclined to say if most were as sensitive as Henderson?I have no vested interest in defending theology because I cannot say, with him or Farrer, "It is too late in the day to tell me that the God with whom I have communed with all my life doesn't exist." There are obviously deep, personal reasons why I have an aversion for stating such things in cold print, or assuming it in my life. However, the attractiveness of Farrer's position is that one doesn't re quire those kind of assurances to test the philosophical merits of personal ism (although one doubtless benefits in immeasurable ways by such prag matic applications). But this cuts two ways. May it not be that a strong, rational defense of traditional theology, which rejects my and Farrer's brand of salutary agnosticism, closes the mind to the dynamic, living reality of God, whereupon the conviction of faith becomes its millstone? Ed is right, just, to describe Farrer as an apologist, even if I believe he was driven to that extreme by a dismissive Positivism, and that once that</page><page sequence="25">The Author Responds 105 curse of polemics is removed, Farrer's prose still stands up to philosophical scrutiny. Doubtless I am less gracious, or secure, than Ed about having Farrer dismissed as a "house" theologian. At the same time I am delighted at Henderson's defense of Farrer's traditionalism. (I confess to allowing myself to be roped into our three-ring circus to engage him and his respon sible scholarship and now feel I can pass on to other things with a sense of relief, debt repaid.) But I want to take a line which I believe equally in keeping with Farrer's metaphysical personalism. Religion is a form-of-life through which Spirit comes to recognize itself in persons. (The Germans had a word for it, Lebenswelt. Even James used it.) I assure readers, "Conti's view" is merely a probe. I have no interests in proving my position as the "reading." Narrow is the way leading to bigotry; broad is the path that leads to philosophical insight. Perhaps that is why I find this dialogue so compelling. I believe theology proceeds by a dialectic comparable to personal interaction?"with any God about whom we have something to do." This is analogous to those others, like those here, who graciously engage us. Perhaps that is why Ed and I "jell" in the spoken mode and our differences are minimized "live"; why more than one "reading" is possible; and why I am absolutely convinced theology is in the gravest danger when it conducts its case from the presumption of assured goods. But that is why, let us not forget it, Farrer took the experience of nurture as the fundamental analogy for grace and why I owe all these conversants an enormous debt of gratitude. Reply to Roger Badham I am indebted to Roger for having worked so effectively under so short a deadline. He has credited me with offering a kind of metaphysics "currently missing in present philosophical and theological discourse." At the same time Roger wonders if I have carried Farrer's reforms far enough to engage contemporary minds. What ingredient is missing? If we accept Roger's account, it has some thing to do with our precarious sense of being a subject or "person." Badham thinks there is something dated in the approach I take to personal identity. He has fingered an important area where my own research has carried me. But Farrer's morally complicitous self not only does not pro hibit, it actually encourages, precisely what Roger sees as the all-important ingredient of modern identity theory, namely, the intrinsic sociality of the self. That I hope to show.</page><page sequence="26">106 Charles Conti After some very generous and, to my mind, perceptive remarks?itself an example of how identity is compounded by interaction?Roger adds, "Farrer does not deal with the problematic raised by the Continental drift of Foucault and many postmodern thinkers regarding the death of the subject. If the death of the human subject presents a degree of problematic, how much more the language of God as subject?" 'Tis true, Farrer was no "postmodern" thinker; but he might have taken some consolation from the fact that the "death of the subject" seems headed where the "death of God" movement took us, away from outmoded transcendence to that venue where any subject-noun has purchase, among others. Roger considers it "unfortunate" I failed to consider the "startling contrast" between those "individual" and "social" models for conceiving God which Wayne Proudfoot presented in God and the Self. Looking on the inside of myself, and underscoring the asymmetry between public and private selves, I assure him nothing preoccupied me more fully in writing Metaphysical Personalism. This is what forced me to look again at what Farrer was doing in Faith and Speculation. I found it merged nicely with Hartshorne's more "social" conception of God. After reconsidering the Farrer corpus, I concluded it was precisely the growing strains on transcendence, an awareness of the disparity between the venerable "Being'-ontology and that "being-for-others" found in all forms of "social" existence, which prompted Farrer to introduce greater sociality in God in the later work. That included receptivity and reactivity, even a degree of "relativity" or relatedness; love as extensional outreach. (Even trinity Farrer took as a minisociety of three-in-one.) Roger writes (or wrongs): "Rather than beginning with the individual person and arguing towards sociality, as Farrer does, Royce inverts the direction." Well before Wittgenstein helped current philosophers dismantle the rickety inferential bridge of analogy, Farrer insisted on "connaturality" (a notion borrowed from Aquinas's philosophical psychology, emphasizing our natural com plicity with others). One doesn't have to proceed "from" self "to" others, since we start from the social genus and differentiate ourselves against a social backdrop of others. Farrer instinctively understood the deconstruc tivist point that self-love is an absurdity, worse, an insipidity, because in Finite and Infinite he charged Descartes and Hume with a similar solipsistic mistake. Selfhood establishes a principle of copresence, and grace (he added in Faith and Speculation) is the "social" paradigm for</page><page sequence="27">The Author Responds 107 spiritual renewal. Farrer, I concluded, anointed "the self with the holy unction of grace, not the extreme unction of the death of the subject. Badham informs us, in no uncertain terms, of the significance of Royce's communitarianism. "The results are by no means trivial. The sociality of persons demands that we understand the dynamic of communi ty through which self-knowledge ... is made possible. Language, as social, is already speech." That reverses even better (as Derrida insisted). Speech as language puts "the social" first. That is why, moreover how, Farrer dismantled the bridge of analogy. "Mentality... is a social product. Thought is the interiorization of dialogue. We should not think at all, were we not mutually aware" (FS, 126). That was the Farrer of Faith and Speculation who, as I argued in Metaphysical Personalism, used the social presumption to reform the austere idea of "divine act." It brought transcen dence more under the cover clause of concepts. Using a similar "bridge" metaphor, Roger writes: We are not trapped in the isolation of thought which must be transformed into the magic bridge of speech in order to communicate with others. Rather we are already social beings, carried within the stream of language which is the currency of our community. Like antiphonal choristers and virtually twinning the same point, Farrer went on to make the social point about speech-acts: "Speech is the stan dard case of mutual communication; but speech is merely a specialized form of intentional action directed at one's fellows, and understanding of speech presupposes acknowledgement of other-personal activity as such." Finishing it off with a flourish even stronger Roger's "already social beings," Farrer stated, "It is not possible to be a mind which neither accepts nor has accepted other-personal activity for what it is." An excerpt from a letter to Henderson (from which Roger quoted to be found in my book) stated unequivocally: Of course I agree that personal "existence" is a function of the community of discourse, and that (transpersonal) talking comes before (interior) thinking. . . . You mention . . . my trivial work Love Almighty; how strongly I embrace the view that humanity (in the "person" sense) is a social product. (Metaphysi cal Personalism, 272) In that book, Farrer offered a Wittgensteinian reminder (also quoted in my book) of the importance of language transmission: "the talking animal is talked into talk by those who talk at him; and how if they talk crooked?"</page><page sequence="28">108 Charles Conti (LAIU, 114; cf. MP, 226n.l5). Not only are persons social "products," they are networked in an extensional sense. That being so, Farrer raised the solipsistic possibility: "[I]s the activity of any agent conceivable without a field constituted by other agents?" Answering his own question in the negative: "The relationship [of interrelations] is constitutive of the exis tence we (and other fin?tes) enjoy. The traditional theology amounts to denying any analogy of it to God, while asserting of him an analogy of interpersonal relations of discourse in the Blessed Trinity." (Notice, even the relation of trinity is conceived linguistically, in terms of "relations of discourse.") Eventually Farrer emended this even more on the social side of the ledger, allowing more sociality in God. (Finite and Infinite had denied "sociality" to God to spare God finite encroachment.) In "The Prior Actuality of God," involvement in creation is "constitutive" of God, the very word once denied. All this, Badham might say, is the later Farrer, after he had read Hart shorne who helped thaw the austere God of Aristotle. Not so. The social dimension of language played a vital part in Finite and Infinite. Written as the German armies were invading Europe, this work was undertaken as an antidote to the solipsistic tendencies of a positivistic Humeanism. Even taking bundles of "sense-presented stuff as "the fundamental world unit"?the way sense-datum philosophers talked back then?Farrer challenged the adequacy of interpreting reality by physical paradigms. We personalize the "raw" stuff of experience, constructing a "pseudogenus" to include "self and "others" in one epistemological continuum. Describing the importance of our receptivity by another in terms that Lacan would welcome, of the "mirror" function by which we admire or satire the other, Farrer wrote: We grow up in a field where individual lives are in mutual relation, each functioning in a way that will maintain it in the face of others or at their expense, unless the laugh happens to be with the others. Our conscious experi ences find themselves framed from the start by this system; the organism or quasi-organism is from the start the natural unit of our thought, and not those sense elements with which a sophisticated analysis first makes us acquainted. (FI, 67) Calling sense-datum philosophy "sophisticated" is, of course, irony; like wise, describing sense-datum philosophy as a "quasi-organism" is a tease. In light of the intrinsic "sociality" of the self, Farrer argued that sense datum particulars offer a specious base from which to infer knowledge of</page><page sequence="29">The Author Responds 109 self or world. Who identifies a pig in terms of tentative sense data: first a pink blob with pointed ears, then details of flat nose, squiggly tail and stumpy legs? Don't we learn the thing entire, in relation to the concept so attired? To students, I caricature it as Ayer's thanksgiving hymn, a two part parody of knowledge: "first the datum doth appear, then interpretation draweth near"?pending, of course, a verificationist test. Too sophistical, was J. L. Austin's response in Sense and Sensibilia. Farrer employed a similar argument regarding personal identity. Coopera tive effect, not the tentative deliverances of sensa, convey our sense of what is real or not. Our sense of who we are takes its cue from the mutual impingement of interactive selves. This interactionist epistemology stands in stark contrast to those "blessed givens" much beloved of English phi losophers. Likewise, chapter 20 of Finite and Infinite argued that interfer ence and "disturbance effect" generate our fundamental sense of "thing hood"?"the immediate effect of being up against that with which we interact in some manner on a level and which must thus be known as to some degree in pari materia with our own activity and being." This Latin tag makes the point that mind is effectively a natural extension of our con crete being-in-a-world, and "world" an ontological construct of mind, logically coterminous. In pari materia appears in all Farrer's major philo sophical books and might have warned against thinking Farrer a metaphys ical "individualist," guilty of constructing a worldview that betrays a basic discontinuity between self and others. We are aware, and only are aware (maintained Farrer) in relation. "For we are social beings, and in a thousand other ways, dependent on what is outside us for the date of our proper and indeed highest activity." That was written in Finite and Infinite, as early as 1943 (FI, 58). All this seems "robustly" social, and allows suffi cient latitude for Roger's insistence that "our thought processes are formed and shaped by our culture." Contrast this "social" Farrer with Proudfoot's representation in God and the Self (as quoted in Metaphysical Personal ism): In the individualistic approach ... the autonomy of the individual is stressed. Individuals initiate acts and are acted upon. They are never able to enter one another or to participate in the being of one another. They attract, repel, collide and cooperate. After debating with my social self whether to go public or no, I tucked a discreet response to Proudfoot's "breaking-and-entering" self in a footnote.</page><page sequence="30">110 Charles Conti (The image which more immediately springs to mind comes from the Oxford story. Never knowing when to use euphemisms?the way the En glish upper class put down strivelings?a certain professor used to receive letters from visiting counterparts asking whether he were free on such-and such a day to have lunch and, please, some social intercourse. That be mused the wife of the sought-after don who never ceased taking delight in retelling it, or gave her some light relief!) As regards Proudfoot's more stealth-footed claim that metaphysical individualists never enter each other, I remarked in that discrete footnote, "At risk of even greater impropriety, Farrer expressed the exact opposite sentiments. 'Substances are really related by entering each into the others, under the form of ingredient.' " So Farrer denied in so many words, being well aware of the danger, his argu ment was 'heading towards solipsism,' the risk of metaphysical individual ism, as Proudfoot sees it," certainly the case in the classical conception of God (see FI, 216; MP, 214n.6). In Metaphysical Personalism, I conceded there was some discrete iso lationism in Farrer's original conception of God. But it wasn't, I insisted, the fault of his philosophical anthropology?which was decidedly "social." It arose from importing some unpurged Aristotelian leaven on the "top end" of the scale. To Aristotle, change meant impermanence, imperma nence implied decay, and decay risked the threat of nonbeing, and one hardly wanted a God who went out of being in time or over time. So God became, by implication, immutable, "above" time. In a catchphrase, Changes all about us in the things we see; changeless must the eternal be. Process theologians retort: Changes all about us in the things we see, dynamic must any Deity be! I reminded readers that the esse of operari is perfectly compatible with this; the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Activity (not mystic Eckhart's pure "Isness"). This brought "being" under the cover clause of active concepts, being as a way of be-ing. Being exists in the adverbial mode, qua becoming. Farrer accepted this "purge" of perfection from the predicate of being, I maintained. To moderns (I remarked in chap. 6), being is the instantiation of linguistic form, characteristically expressed in verbs of doing. The sociality of God happily exists, then, in the theophanic mode, as epiphany. How well this fits the God of the Bible who also acts in the lives of persons. How well, too, it fits the moral moment, when the self reenters its own act, so deconstructs itself with apology or regret, and recenters itself midway in the realm of the "in-between"; that area Buber and L?vinas so</page><page sequence="31">The Author Responds 111 delicately divinized for philosophy. Farrer plumbed the same area in the central chapters of Finite and Infinite for the view that the self regards itself as derivative or dependent on others for its sense of well-being. The charge of metaphysical individualism (I countered in Metaphysical Personalism) results from a failure to appreciate the role moral deliberation played in "de-logicizing"?Farrer's term?the finite/Infinite conjunction of the early work, latterly bringing the terms closer together in a shared universe of discourse; no longer polar opposites, but on a continuum, each participant in the "life" of the other; in fact, so much in tune with the other that Farrer could now speak of the divine/human complementarity: "two agents sharing a single act." But the basis for this sort of complicity began in the central chapters of Finite and Infinite where the natural con junctiveness of "self and others" was taken as providing the "material evi dence" of faith, that the interpretation the theistic believer puts on things, made in the image of some "other," is not without its evidences in the natural world of common experience, equally conjoined with others and in the same moral web that trembles with spiritual concerns, Farrer argued. So phrased, one can see the importance of establishing the category of "otherness" as intrinsic to the subject-self. This section?a fascinating contribution to philosophical psychology, a book within a book, as one reviewer put it?shows the importance of using the idea that we are a subject in an expropriable world to resolve more sanitized theories of knowledge arising from positivistic skepticism, that move which (William James argued) so denuded epistemology. There Farrer "mined" the self for its moral implications. Consciousness is "placed" by our acts of intending, apart from which it would be neither conscious nor even an "act." But it is always a placement a propos the real world. "Always [in analyzing the logic of intentional action] there appears an agent, something he is concerned with, and the act in which he deals with this thing." Extending the notion of concern, he wrote, "The self is a bundle of concernments with that outside world." "The world is still seen through a filter of relatedness to self." Chapter 20 described this as a causal affective theory: it is the experience of impinging or being impinged that gives us our fundamental sense of self in relation to things. "For explore as widely as it may, it is always exploring the world insofar as it impinges on the organism with pressures of such sorts as can affect its existence." Hampshire was to make the same point some twenty years later</page><page sequence="32">112 Charles Conti in devising a philosophy of action to expand the passive theories of percep tion inherited from Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. This qualifies our fundamental unity. "We shall always be baffled [Farrer wrote] if we look within the self for our fundamental unity. Our unity is achieved in relation to acts performed. These obtain their effective ness in relation to "things" suborned. Better to act in relation to others, neither in the Nietzschean dominant mode nor as a sacrificial love-slave victim. "When I experience myself as coming into action against another self, substantial unity is something that I am aware of (see FI, 176, 220, 221,225). But precisely because our fundamental unity is realized "coming up" against another self as a sentient center of consciousness, a being "like" ourself, the individual will does not go unqualified. Although the will enjoys the right of self-determination, being in principle free to choose and implement its acts, we find that the will acts under constraints. (This was part of the larger claim that we "paradoxically qualify" our fundamen tal unity on behalf of others, eschewing "master/slave" relations.) We sense our compresence with others, so intuit the obligation to act. Precisely where esse chooses its acts, conscience is anointed with moral concerns, so finds its sense of appointment in the welfare of others. Free activity of the sort one finds in moral decision making (Farrer concluded) is "an event of unique metaphysical importance" (see FI, 222; cf. 169). It informs us that the will is bound over by the very things that implement it, its interac tion in a world of objects and others, preferred others. It was, I reckoned, a significant "social" metaphysic. We recognize intuitively that we are "connectedly" human; "connatural" with others. In modern idiom, we live an interface metaphysic. We take note of the "outside" implications of act to avoid the "inner" feeling of social embar rassment, to avoid losing face. The "paradox" was no great sacrifice since we already are deeply affected by others. So Finite and Infinite concluded, "we must either support or enhance the best, both in our own pattern of existence and in that of others" (FI, 297). This privileges the person-model, and shows the important use to which Farrer put social sensitivity. It was at the heart of the adoption of my metaphysical personalism, since persons are social beings through and through. Roger is concerned, on the flip side of this, about not overemploying the one person-model. I would reply like this. Since God is unique, it follows that God's relation to the world is also unique. It further follows that no one model or image could possibly do it full justice. So (as</page><page sequence="33">The Author Responds 113 Henderson reminds us) a dialectic of images may enable us to grasp the unique character of the God/world relation. But it is not only a dialectic of images, but images themselves which are dialectical. Images enrich our appreciation by reminding us what language is not, mirror image or picture perfect. Art deprives us of a literal object. Images do the same for lan guage. That is why Farrer used images to resist the claims of Positivism, even though a realism of revealed images might, as a theologian, have come natural to him, as H. D. Lewis defended theism against Logical Positivism. Looking back over history (Farrer wrote) one finds a "fabulous and absurd variety" of theistic models. Wryly he remarked, "the figure of man has been far more constant than the figure of God, for man has kept at least his human lineaments, but God has been a beast, a vapor and a star." He concluded that the history of the Christian religion exhibits "a phantasmagoria of scattered vision slowly unified" (quoted in MP, 70). So much for the unity of images, which looks more like modern-day polysemy. There is another remarkable aspect of Farrer's praxis of language that informs me he was no metaphysical individualist. It is not only that images offer the multifacity of shades of meaning, but that writing is a profoundly social act. Here we come up against other aspects of Proudfoot's reading, this time the more linguistic aspects of individualism. Essentially, Proudfoot contends that the shift from Finite and Infinite, Farrer's magnum opus published in 1943, to The Glass of Vision, his next major work in 1948, roughly parallels Wittgenstein's move from the picture propositional, rigid designator treatment of language in the Tract atus to the more discursive use theory of the Philosophical Investigations.6 In Farrer's case, the shift supposedly entails a move from a "names as tags" (see GS, 94, 101, 120, 132, 148n.27, 150, 152), quasiscientific7, "ejaculatory" (GS, 15, 120 [twice], 132)?one assumes he means some thing like spontaneous?view of language early on, to the more "expres sive" and "imagistic thinking" of the later work.8 Farrer's theory of lan 6God and the Self (hereafter GS) 108, 147n.27; cf. Proudfoot's article "Con ceptions of God and the Self," 63n.25. 7Throwing all caution to the wind, and ignoring the via negativa or "splint ered" analogies of that book, Proudfoot writes, "Language in Finite and Infinite is scientific language" (GS, 110; cf. 120). 8See GS, 144, for the distinctions between the "indicative" and "imaginative."</page><page sequence="34">114 Charles Conti guage (he explains) moved from an analysis of language which was "not complicit" with the reality towards which it points, to a greater, more subtle, appreciation of the role description plays in filling out the facts (see GS, 111, 123, 147nn.l7 and 27). By "noncomplicity," Proudfoot is alluding to language/world commensurability, essentially charging Farrer with wcommensurability, where the object should, but fails to, hold certain consequences for the language user. This produced a theory of language that was (in Proudfoot's estimation) more polarized than bipolar, more dis junctive than showing continuity or conjunctiveness. Finite and Infinite pro duced a disjointed theory of language instead of one that emphasizes the natural cohabitation of percepts and concepts, wedging apart all those deli cate commensurabilities between subject and object, person and world, in cluding the natural concerns of language with reality and all the descriptive opportunities it affords the language user. Although Proudfoot did not say it outright?E. S. Brightman did9 (and so did I in Metaphysical Personalism)?this disjunctiveness left "finite" and "infinite" terms estranged, suffering from a form of discrete particular ism. I conceded there was an element of truth about Proudfoot's criticism theologically, but not in terms of philosophical psychology nor, as I now want to contend, linguistically. Predictably enough, Proudfoot traces this lack of "complicity" to the "autonomous" or "dichotomous"10 philosophy of Descartes who, by a skep tical act of cogitation, cordoned "the self off from others and from its natural setting in the world, resulting in (well-known) solipsism. Purged by proof dissuasion, what one cannot ?febelieve, rather than what one is For the distinction between "expressive" and "descriptive" language, see "Concep tions of God and the Self," 70. In that essay, Proudfoot regrets that this latter dis tinction has been lost in recent theological writing. 9Brightman wrote: "The promise of the title is not fulfilled insofar as it leads the reader to expect a searching examination of various definitions of the Infinite, or of possible conceptions of God as finite (an alternative which Mr. Farrer rejects more vigorously than analytically)." Review of FI, in Philosophical Review (1944): 593. Farrer's eventual confrontation with process theology gave him the means to reconsider Brightman's suggestion. 10See GS, 31, 88-89, 98-99, 100-101, esp. 102, 123, 161. In "Conceptions of God and the Self," he concluded that solipsism is "an ever present threat," "a real possibility' to the individualistic type of metaphysic (62n.20).</page><page sequence="35">The Author Responds 115 naturally inclined to believe or accept about the world, that very rich fund of natural beliefs which Wittgenstein reminded us makes language or con ceptual thought possible, Descartes's methodology takes on the peculiar air of a negative acquisition, a purgatio of rinsed doubt. This overlooks what one is naturally inclined to accept from experience since prompted by experience. Under such an ??natural Cartesian mode of acquisition, words (in Proudfoot's estimation) stand for the "private experience of apprehen sion" (GS, 98). Concepts function as tabloid or "serial" installments of reality, and linguistic acts become those merely pointing to, or labelling "individual sense impressions" prompted by things lying "overagainst" us.11 Under the influence of so particular or discrete a view of language, words function as "tags," designating the designata, like "ejaculatory responses" that accompany the apprehension, running roughly in guttural unison to what is "given." This would surely be a disquieting claim for any true analogician of language who constructed his word bridges with extreme care and used lan guage with great delicacy. Fairer gives the impression of seldom, if ever, setting a foot-syllable wrong. He was, to be sure, a great stylist. As mentioned, the "shadow of logical atomism" supposedly hangs over Farrer's early work (GS, 120). Words are discrete isomorphs or atomic par ticulars corresponding loosely to "what is." Such a bifurcation (Proudfoot contends) "ignores or minimizes" (GS, 148n.27) the "complicity of the observer and speaker in the discovery of the facts, itself ignoring the difference between the two.12 This oversimplified view of Farrer's theory nProudfoot sees the "overagainstness" of things as attesting to metaphysically isolate or discrete isomorphs, succumbing to the threat of solipsism (GS, 101). Hampshire and Farrer, per contra, take the "overagainstness" of things in a logi cally continuous sense, eliciting (moral) response. Only things overagainst one can impinge upon us with any degree of conviction. It was this sense of exterior com pulsion Descartes left behind when he retreated into interior thought. For further discussion of the "conditioned by" and "conditioning" aspect of the impinging "overagainstness" of things, see "Causes" in RF and FI, 67. "I treat the thing as an 'other' overagainst 'me,' and though I do not call myself a 'thing' or the 'thing' a 'self,' I do erect a pseudogenus of which 'thing' and 'self are species." 12Minimizing "the facts" for the sake of their creative representation as in art or visual imagery, is hardly giving them the cold Bavarian shoulder, as when Descartes preferred the comfort of his stove to the society of his fellow persons. On the other hand, to "minimize" or play things down may be the height of social</page><page sequence="36">116 Charles Conti of language allows Proudfoot to sweep Wittgenstein and Farrer into a single generalization. "Both [men] interpret language in a way that is indi vidualistic" (GS, 148n.27). This is as imperceptive of Wittgenstein's "social" theory of the self, making the very idea of a "private language" unintelligible, as it is unjust to the communitarian thrust of Farrer's phi losophy of language. Both philosophers reminded us of the natural "stage setting" or scene setting of language, its social context. Sensing overstatement here, Proudfoot tried to soften the accusation of "noncomplicity." In Wittgenstein's and Farrer's actual use of language (he explained), that is, in the execution of their work, "both men show more recognition of this complicity than their analysis would imply." Apparently we are to be reminded that, although Farrer's and Wittgenstein's booh bordered on theoretical solipsism?because language "stands apart" from what it names, sucking its own denotative thumb?nevertheless these men did write for an audience, so may be exonerated of the charge of philoso phical privatism. Here is discursive balm for the solipsist sore, a sort of social release from metaphysical narcissism. Although Farrer's and Witt genstein's theories of language were denotatively bereft, disestablished by their author's propensity for metaphysical "individualism," their use of language was discursively rich. So the failure to find convincing arguments for their analysis of language was allayed by the aptitude of their art. It is rather like saying one betrays one's truer thoughts on language not when one is writing about it philosophically but when one is talking loosely. But in Farrer's case, I never met a man who spoke more like what he wrote and wrote in the style of natural speech. Mitchell himself men tions how effortlessly he passed between modes of discourse. Unlike the Bourgeois Gentilhomme, he would not have been surprised to learn he talked prose all his life. That is because Farrer realized language making is part and parcel of the "social" fabric of persons, and that, mutatis mutandis, sociality enters deeply into our use of (even) thought-language. The fact that he wrote standing up, as if lecturing to an imaginary audi ence, is perhaps relevant here.13 Farrer's early penchant for "noncomplicity" dramatically changed (or so Proudfoot contends) in The Glass of Vision where the very titles of Far etiquette, not "ignoring" others. 13See CF, 74, also 97,104. Converting this "social" requirement into an aspect of Christology, see 89 and 104-105.</page><page sequence="37">The Author Responds 117 rer's first and second book herald the move away from the crisp disjunc tiveness of "finite" and "infinite" to the altogether richer images of The Glass of Vision. (So too, in Proudfoot's estimation, does the fact that Farrer eventually adopted the literary form of a dialogue in the Gifford Lectures and books thereafter confirm a more "discursive" endorsement of language.) Such charming Alician literalism surely goes too Wonderland far, however, when Proudfoot suggests that the primary analogy for the knowing-act in The Glass of Vision is, as the very title suggests, "still that of the eye" (GS, 137). It never was?certainly not in the "visual" or "focal" sense implied14?so that whe i, re?" ning backwards, Proudfoot con cludes that what is essentially but mispresei/edly bound up with the finite/ Infinite disjunction was not an analogical "dialectic" working in and through language?despite its author's explicit and repeated declamations to that very effect?but something akin to an "existential" act of "seeing" or "Gestalt-switch," "reflecting again the tradition of the visio dei "15, one sees how a wayward metaphor, reflecting (perhaps) its author's own pen chant for descriptive over analytical concepts, can carry grave philoso phical consequences for theology. Farrer certainly had a theory of language and it was entirely commen surate with use, being derived from use; specifically, the textual polyva lence of shared meaning. Such textuality renders possible those moral judg ments that alert one to the descriptive discharge of language, creating moral valences and opening all the finer roads to communication. Like 14See GS, 106, 135-36, 145, for Farrer's alleged stress on "visual imagery": "a term with visual connotations," retaining between FI and GV "the visual model of apprehension." Proudfoot writes that apprehension conveys a moment "caught in an instant like a snapshot" (153). 15Proudfoot writes: But the notion of apprehension to which the book is directed, the vision of God that may be attained if one directs his attention and can grasp the Gestalt of the finite/Infinite relation, is also based on the tradition of the visio dei as the highest achievement of human life and knowledge that is granted to the saints. Farrer entitles his lectures on the inspiration of biblical authors and of the saints of the Church The Glass of Vision, reflecting again the tradition of the visio dei" (GS, 162). This is a serious misrepresentation of the noetic, epistemological role Farrer granted images in the Bampton Lectures, and further overlooks the challenge of FI to recognize a "genuine analogy" using "splintered images" to "leap" to the apprehension of the fin?tes" "participatedness" in an Infinite (see FI, 262-63,293).</page><page sequence="38">118 Charles Conti Wittgenstein, and using nearly the same figure of speech, Farrer tried to woo philosophers from their "fly pitch" on the ceiling, stressing "the rela tion of real propositions to practical responses."16 Philosophers (he warned) are inclined to take too detached view of language, "impartially appreciat ing their own words and gestures as from the vantage point of a fly on the ceiling," whereas the most concrete form of language is "attention to and response to real entities according to their intrinsic worth, their need and also, no doubt, according to the degree in which their enter into the orbit of our own existence" (FI, 101). Intersecting orbits. Are these the cross-al tercations of a theoretical solipsism, or the value modalities which come from taking "the other" with deep philosophical seriousness, even moral sobriety? Farrer did not, I insist, set "the other" overagainst "the self as a meta physical solipsist might mug-arrange them, cold shouldering "I/Thou" rela tionships out of the way. The "intersecting orbits" of Finite and Infinite were deliberately designed to call attention to our moral overlap or con 16FI, 77. For the relation of "the word-using faculty" to "behavior as a whole," see FI, 74-76, 101-102, 153. Proudfoot, in his article version of his book, "Conceptions of God and the Self," quotes FI, 72-78 by way of suggesting that "Farrer understands language to be a conventional response that is independent of apprehension." Slip of pen aside?Proudfoot cited Faith and Speculation?this is still the wrong section to cite and undermines his point. (Farrer dealt with the language of apprehension on 97ff, and even there it is not apparent Proudfoot has completely understood Farrer. In the section Proudfoot cites, FI, 72ff., Farrer held that "language arises from a response of a conscious organism to its environment." He said this by way of enlarging the Positivist's cramped vision, inviting them to align apprehension with practical concerns, not word behavior alone [FI, 72, 75].) Farrer applied this pragmatic test to God in FS, showing how close his early epistemology was to his later theology. It is not plausible "we should be able to talk about things about which we can do nothing but talk." (Cf. FI, 74, also 294 with FS, 22, 28, 36.) This empirical mandate is important not only because it represents real interaction with objects?not just collected observation reports?but prompts such behavior patterns as may be described as "continued apprehension." "[W]e pause in our walk, dilate our nostrils and draw in our breath that we may continue to enjoy a country smell that pleases us" (FI, 75). By "apprehension" Farrer meant sensual and intellectual appreciation. We take apprehensive note of such experiences not only to savor them but by way of calling attention to the continuity between experience and what experience prompts by way of certain forms of appreciative language. Cf. Farrer's "continued apprehension" with Proudfoot's "discontinuous" model, chap. 3, esp. 161.</page><page sequence="39">The Author Responds 119 naturality with others. This "widening" of the social circle was intended to act as a rebuke to the Positivist's preoccupation with factual, atomic propo sitions to the detriment of ethics, aesthetics, and religion, the postulate of loving ideals, all valued aspects of social life. In short, Farrer's under standing of language in its practical, moral bearing clearly affected his theoretical formulation since (he maintained) the art of language is learned by action and interaction. By intercourse with those human others, our fundamental humanity is preserved, even created. So Finite and Infinite emphasized the sociality of "the self in moral exchange with a world of other selves. All this was designed to remind us of natural forms of reverence, creating an analogy for transcendence. "Hallowed" others de mand a sacred response; "otherness" teaches us "thouness." "It'-objects, on the other hand, invite scorn. Moral language thus redresses positivistic shortcomings. That was the function to which Farrer put creative morality in Finite and Infinite, namely and specifically, to enliven and sensitize our social being qua becomings. Moral language informs us of the presence of the other. The language of morality creates a social covenant, no mere social contract. By honoring these, our natural commitments within moral lan guage, Farrer deflated the "contemplative rationality" of which rationalist philosophers are notoriously capable. The view from the fly pitch comes down to earth when we have to make up our minds about what things are and how we are to relate to them (FI, 109). In this way, Finite and Infinite brought our "word-using faculty" to bear on our social behavior "as a whole" (FI, 74). We name things as they impinge upon us; we respond to agents as they affect us. By comparison, Positivism isolated the practical setting of language from just that form of justification which preserves all human interest, which involves the giving and taking of value judgments. Positivists achieved a certain clarity of thought (Farrer conceded) at the expense of life relevance, namely, coveted social responses. Given this highly valued aspect of what it means to be a person, it was natural that morality was, for him, at the crossroads where the practical and the theoretical aspects of language intersect. It is also where philosophy spills over into theology. Valuation leads to "higher goods." Coreferentiality, the natural place setting of language, stretches human sensibilities. And "otherness" is undoubtedly a form of alterity wherein both natural and religious overtones blend as one.</page><page sequence="40">120 Charles Conti Only by overlooking the role of morality in "delogicizing" and reuniting "finite" and "infinite" terms does Proudfoot find it possible to accuse Farrer of metaphysical individualism. I said this loud and clear in Metaphysical Personalism. And even if Proudfoot is correct about the nature of the change in Farrer's language (rather than seeing it as coterminous from the very start), this is only further evidence of Farrer's social-minded self following his Gifford Lectures. To write with an imaginary conversant in mind is why, I suggest, our author was such a good writer. The same sense of "overagainstness" which informed his moral being also informed Farrer's literary style. But why do we identify with conscious mind when we think of per sons? Simply because that is the one aspect with which we can identify. Consciousness holds the key to personal identity. Mind is the instrument of apprehension that identifies the range of atomic, genetic, biological, physical, social, moral, spiritual determinants that make consciousness possible. Isn't it natural to take the most recognizably free aspect of per sonal identity, conscious mind, when we are trying to identify the most creative assets of nature? This is another advantage of doing theology on voluntarist premises. If the capacity to enter the meaning of our act is what makes us causative agents, are we to assume anything less than personal sentience on the part of God? Surely conscious mind is our privileged means of recognizing any parallels in the creative "funding" of a world. We identify with the higher forms of nature, not the genetic undercode or neuronal underlaborer, since we have no access to those atomic depths, nor need to. Also because we are primarily aware of ourselves in relation to others as realized in acts of speech, discourse, utterance, and moral intercourse. It is to sentient-like things we appeal when we want an explanation for the meaning of creative act. To my mind, the most compelling reason why the person-model is the most apt for conceiving God?besides the obvious reason that it is the only product of nature that can reflect back on the entire process and think "gods"?is that it closes the gap between anthropology and theology. The poet Alexander Pope wrote, "Know then thyself, presume not God to scan; / The proper study of mankind is man." But what if in the reflexive self consciousness of persons is a sense of alterity around which the whole idea of personal identity is constructed; something approximating a hint of recognition of some holy other? And what if that sense of "otherness"</page><page sequence="41">The Author Responds 121 carries the sense of a living presence? Wouldn't this be as natural and healthy a way of doing theology as possible, while at the same time beneficial to persons? In my book I argued that if God "theomorphizes" persons, makes us "in the divine image," it might follow that anthropomorphic language draws whatever relevance or cogency it has from this original impress on our minds. A divine similitudo suggests that language about God and per sons must be to some extent isomorphic if the Creator is responsible for the creature and the creature seeks to worship, or just plain comprehend, in terms that are meaningful to it. The truth of a personalist metaphysic is thus twofold: hypothetically, we bear the impress of divinity within us; human sensibilities forever seek the "diviner" mode. But even putting this aside, the fact that we aspire in the form of "gods" not only confirms the stake of theology in anthropology, but shows how to sublime anthropology for persons. Social persons project a loving God, because a loving Deity provides a sound basis for social persons. No coincidence, Feuerbach re marked. The models we use to "think" God reveal as much about ourselves as they facilitate our conception of God. Anthropology thus leads to theology; but theology returns as ethics, to haunt or help us. Credit, then, where credit is due. We learn of the correlation of theolo gy and anthropology in a fresh and exciting way from Proudfoot's fertile book God and the Self. Communal beings conceive "God" in the personal form; a loving God informs us how to be with other persons. The light shines both ways. This can only be the case if God is Person and if the predicates by which we "think" this God share something in common with us. One assumes it is the common coinage of acts that unites agents. That is as social as I can conceive any metaphysical "gospel," even if (as Fairer suggested) the assumptio carnis of God helped the entire project along, the Logos which became flesh by "becoming." That presence is not unlike the blessings we experience in shared discourse, such as this conver sation has generated, and may even be vitally dependent on it, leading me to thank my colleagues for any part they may have played in advancing orality and sociality.</page></plain_text>
