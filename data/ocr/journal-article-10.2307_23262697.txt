<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS Vol. 12:1 (Fall/Winter 84/85) 68-94 THE CONTINUUM OF GODS AND THE PERSONALITIES OF MEN S. Giora Shoham Professor of Criminology Faculty of Law Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv Israel ABSTRACT The paper applies the Shoham personality theory to the classification of religions. The personality theory on the individual level which envisages the object-anchored separant personality as contrasted with the participant object-aversive personality, is raised to the social character and type of religion. The types of religions are classified according to the Sisyphean-Tantalic continuum. The extreme Sisyphean religions are the activist-object manipulated religions like the Greek and the Germanic, whereas on the Tantalic extreme, we have the quietest, resigned religions, like Taoism and Buddhism. Between these two extremes, all religions have been taxonomized according to their theological and behavioral functions. "God does not need the truth, he has it. He needs masks" Isak Dinesan. Seven Gothic Tales In the present paper we shall try and construe a continuum of deities corresponding to man's personality types as presented elsewhere in our personality theory.' We propose to recapitulate here the basic tenets of this theory which are as follows: The two personality core vectors have been denoted by us as "participation" and "separation." By par 68</page><page sequence="2">S. Giora Shoham 69 ticipation we mean the identification of ego with a person(s), an object or a symbolic construct outside himself, and his striving to lose his separate identity by fusion with this other object or sym bol. Separation, of course, is the opposite vector. We have used these opposing vectors of unification-fusion and separation isolation as the main axis of our personality theory in conjunc tion with three major developmental phases. The first is the pro cess of birth. The second phase is the crystallization of an individual ego by the molding of the "ego boundary." The third phase of separation is a corollary of socialization when one reaches one's "ego identity."2 The strain to overcome the separating and dividing pressures never leaves the human individual. The striving to partake in a pantheistic whole is ever present and it takes many forms—if one avenue towards its realization is blocked, it surges out from another channel. Actual participation is unattainable by definition. The objective impossibility of participation is augmented by the countering separating vectors, both instinctual and interactive. At any given moment of our lives there would be a disjuncture, a gap between our desires for participation and our subjectively defined distance from our participatory aims. We have denoted this gap the Tantalus Ratio which is the relationship between the longed for participatory goal and the distance from it as perceived by ego.3 Another basic premise of the theory is the fixation of the separant and participant personality types. These are related to the crystallization at later orality of a separate self out of the pantheistic mass of totality at early orality. This is the ontological base-line by which the self is defined by the non-self—the object. The coagulation of the self marks the cutting-off point for the most basic developmental dichotomy. Two separate developmen tal phases are noted—from birth and early orality to the phase where the ego boundary is formed around the emerging individual separatum, and from later orality onwards. In the first phase, any fixation that might occur and thereby imprint some character traits on the developing personality is not registered by a separate self capable of discerning between the objects which are the sources of the fixation-causing trauma and himself as its recipient. The experiencing entity is a non-differentiated pantheistic totality. On the other hand, if the traumatizing fixa tion occurs at the later oral phase, the self may well be in a posi tion to attribute the cause of pain and deprivation to its proper source—the objects. We therefore propose a personality typology which is anchored on this developmental dichotomy of HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="3">70 The Continuum of Gods and the Personalities of Men pre- and post-differentiation of the self.4 The molding process determines the nature and severity of the fixation which in turn determines the placement of a given individual on the personality type continuum. However, the types themselves are fixated according to developmental chronology: the participant at pre-differentiated early orality and the separant after the formation of the separant self. The partici pant core personality vector operates with varying degrees of potency on both these personality types; but the quest for con gruity manifests itself differently with each polar personality type. The participant aims to achieve congruity by effacing and annihilating himself, that is, by melting back into the object and achieving the pantheistic togetherness and non-differentiation of early orality. The separant type aims to achieve congruity by overpowering or "swallowing" the object. We have denoted the congruity aims of the self-effacing participant as exclusion, whereas the object devouring separant wishes to achieve congrui ty by inclusion, that is, by incorporating the object in his out reaching self. The separant core vector manifests itself in creation, corporeality and developmental growth whereas the participant vector seeks the reversal to the noncorporeality and spirituality of non-being. This might well account for the mind-body controver sy raging in philosophy to this very day, The claim of the Sisyphean object-manipulating materialists concerning the exclusiveness of body-matter, and that of the Tantalic rejectors of appearances postulating the "reality" of spirit-mind may be better understood in the light of these personality core vectors. The crucial point here is that both the Sisyphean quest for regaining pre-differentiated Unity by "swallowing" the object and incorporating it in one's personality and the Tantalic longing to melt back into the pantheism of early orality are unattainable by definition. Hence these quests for impossible ideals are pro jected onto Transcedence where the longed-for perfections are not bound by the limits of spatio-temporality. The Tantalic type who has been fixated on non-differentiated early orality projects his God as a monistic omnipresence; whereas the later-orally fixated Sisyphean externalizes his deity as an omnipotent boundless force. Moreover the later oral fixation of the Sisyphean allows him to identify the "source" of his frustrations. The Sisyphean tends to blame his objective and human surround ings for his frustrations in an extrapunitive manner as concep tualized by Rosenzweig.5 The inevitable rift between the HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="4">S. Giora Shoham 71 Sisyphean's separant ideal of controlling and manipulating his surroundings in an omnipotent Faustian manner and his actual competitive achievement are registered by him as a continuous frustration. This chronic discontent is also projected onto Transcendence and manifested by the separant deity as a cons tant need to reinforce His omnipotence. The prayers in many religions include repetitious flatteries and Byzantine assertions in multiple synonyms of imputations of power, wisdom and greatness, as if to placate the potency anxieties projected onto God by His frustrated Sisyphean initiates. The self-effacing Tantalic type is also constantly frustrated because his quietist ideal of melting back into the omnipresent non-being of Unity cannot be realized. Being intropunitive, that is imputing the causes of his frustrations to himself, he projects onto Transcendence a less than perfect deity like the Kabbalist God who seems to be unable to prevent the catastrophe of the breaking of the cosmic vessels and, thereby allows evil to be created or Rilke's puerile God whose unsynchronized hands are responsible for the sorry mess of temporal creation.6 The following chart summarizes our enumeration of personali ty parameters and their corresponding transcendental projection.

In most of the actual metaphysical projections the Sisyphean and Tantalic elements intermingle in varying pro portions. Our continuum is not confined to acknowledged religions. Each one of us has varying amounts and potencies of metaphysical projections, including the secular religion of Com munism, which has the extreme separant metaphysical projection of dialectical materialism, which has been rightly equated by Russell with the Old Testament Yahweh.8 Metaphysical projections define by contrast the misery and "throwness" of temporal existence. In the first phase of separa tion, Man is ejected from the cosy womb and cruelly exposed to the elements in a manner which was registered mytho-empirically by the catastrophe of the breaking of the vessels. The second phase of separation occurs after the existential coagulation of the separate ego from the pantheistic togetherness of early orality. Its mytho-empirical counterpart, the expulsion from Paradise, has God condemn Man to a cursed land in which he will live in sor row all his temporal life. The third phase of separation involving cruel rites of passage from childhood to puberty has been mytho empirically anchored by us to the normative sacrifices of Isaac9 and Iphigenia10. All this implies that temporal existence is marked by ejection from the uterine wholeness, by separation from the early oral Edenic pantheism and by expulsion from the family fold. The regaining of completeness, wholeness and perfection cannot be accomplished in the dire here and now but only in the ever after within the realm of omnipotence and/or omnipresence, After examining the parameters of divinity as pro jected by man we may try and construe in the present work a con tinuum of deities corresponding to man's personality types. This in a sense would impute human personality archetypes to Gods. The relevance of the continuum of Gods to our present work is that man has perennially relied on divinities (which we hold to be the projected unattainable perfect goals of the human personality core vectors) to bridge the epistemological rift between himself and his surroundings, to imbue his life with meaning and to effect his ultimate return to his perfect origins. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="6">S. Giora Shoham 73 As we have specified, the participant core-vector motivates man to revert back to earlier developmental phases, to the pre puberty family fold, to the omnipresence of early orality and to non-being in utero. Therefore the more participant a person is the more he anchors on the unity of non-differentiation. When this fixation is projected on transcendence it is mostly in the form of monotheism, the unity of emanationist religions and the non being of mysticism. It follows that for strict monism-plurality the divisions of space and the sequences of time are vile, trivial or illusory. Participant monotheism is intolerant of other Gods and creeds because an early oral fixation emphasizes not only unity but also uniqueness. Hence, the monotheistic deity is both single and exclusive. On the other hand, separant polytheistic religions tend to be more tolerant of other dieties but most of the gods are in competition with one another very much like the competitive and arriviste individuals in Sisyphean human societies. The object-related organizing and manipulating separant god is deus faber, that is an active doer-god whereas the participant god is more one of being, manifesting the mystique of ontology. The continuum of divinities is evident in the presence of monistic par ticipant elements in separant pluralistic creeds and vice versa. The trinity in Christianity is an example for the latter whereas Henotheism which postulates a belief in one god yet conceding the existence of others is an instance of the former. Our reliance on myths as mytho-empirical anchors for our con tinuum of gods is linked to our contention that divinities are pro jections of the perfect unattainable goals of our personality core vectors. We hold myths to be collective projections of human developmental phases. They are archetypal processes linked to our prime-motivations inherent in the goals of our core vectors which are projected as gods. Myths are therefore projected most ly as sacred records of events which happened in the archaic before time of ille-tempore and their sources are the common developmental experiences of human beings as ordained and pro grammed by our core vectors and which are projected as divinities. Myths are therefore natural empirical anchors for our work which conceives gods as human projections. We shall build in the present work a continuum of divinities, creeds and theologies as projections of human personalities rang ing from the participant Tantalic pole to the Sisyphean separant extreme. As all classifications are somewhat artificial we might have unduly streamlined some premises relating to creeds and gods. Yet the patterns are there and the underlying similarities HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="7">74 The Continuum of Gods and the Personalities of Men rather than the overt disparities are our main interest while con struing our continuum. We shall start by describing each type of creed separately and at the end of the work we shall present the entire continuum. Deus Absconsus: The Absent or Silent God The extreme participant anchors on non-being and on his blissful non-awareness in utero before the catastrophe of birth, and his ultimate aim is to revert to nothingness. This is the aim of the Hindu Samadhi, the Buddhist Nirvana, the Gnostic "ascent" and the Hasidic lyum which is literally "rendering into nothingness." These are techniques aiming to abrogate the catastrophe of birth, to annihilate the temporal self concept and body image and revert back to the wholeness, perfection and omnipresent non-being. Hence a wide range of participant mystics ranging from Molinos the Christian quietist through the Moslem Sufis to the Hasidic Maggid of Mezhirech taught that the obliteration and the ontological death of the temporal self leads to its resurrection in unity. The human quest of non-being is therefore projected on a transcendent nothingness which represents the non-embodied boundless infinity of pre-being. The contemporary expositions of the dead deity have been dramatized by Nietszche. Some interpreters hold that even with Nietszche the nihilation of God relates to the disclaimer of an objective diety and His transformation into an immanence of subjectivity. This is quite clear with Keirkegaard and Heidegger. Both expound in widely disparate styles their basic doctrine that authentic transcendence can be reached only through the all embracing nothingness within the inner "pure self." The works of Beckett are permeated with the sense of an absent and silent god, yet Godot (God) does not show up and there is an under lying supposition that he need not come because the mere longing for Him is enough. This in many ways is a bold interpretation of Divinity which could be in line with our major premise in the present work: that the existence of God is not a condition prece dent for Man's existential fulfillment in the here-and-now yet the longing for transcendence which is Man's projected quest of the perfection of his personality core vectors is necessary for initia tion of the processes which may lead to creativity and revelation. God may be absent or silent but the longing for him in itself may be sufficient for the dialectics of Man's fulfillment. A dead, absent or dying god is awe-inspiring and romantic. It HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 1 - FALUWINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="8">S. Giora Shoham 75 has been dramatized by numerous myths, elegized by Nietzsche and rapsodized by Wagner. A silent god, however, is not roman tic, quite difficult to understand and even harder to accept. Dostoevsky's god in The Brothers Karamazov remains silent throughout the grand inquisitor's monologue. He is even asked to remain silent and at the end of the encounter he was told "go, and come no more—don't come at all—never, never."" In Beckett's Waiting for Godot, not only does God not appear, but he is incommunicado. He says nothing to those who wait for him. However man persists in praying to a silent God. Beckett's tramps prayed to Godot although he never seems to have noticed them. Bergman's knight of The Seventh Seal shouts to a God "who must be somewhere yet chooses to keep quiet" and the son-God cries to his seemingly non-responsive father-God "Eli Eli lama shabaktani," The supplication to a silent God marks the participant attitude towards prayer. It is mostly a tool to achieve revelation through the blunting of spatiotemporal consciousness. It is a contemplative means which may reveal oneself to one's innermost non-being. To this end a communicative God is unnecessary. A participant, contemplative prayer is marked by its self sufficiency. A form of religious thought quite prevalent among mystics across denominations, is that God is never silent or absent because He is ever present in us and He reveals Himself to us through our innermost being. God is silent or absent if we seek Him outside us and in our objective surroundings, but He is ever present and communicative if we look for Him within us. The foremost contemporary exponent of this view is Kierkegaard, one of whose basic philosphical tenets is that "God is a subject, and therefore exists only for subjectivity in inwardness.'"2 The extreme participant religious orientation of Kierkegaard is that each one of us is plugged through his subjectivity into the generalized subject which is God. Hence the seeking of the exter nal object-bound God is sacriligious. Only the pre-creation, non objective omnipresence can be projected on transcendence as the totality of Divine Unity which is disrupted, fragmented and profaned by objective plurality. The only revelation possible is by inward renewal which has nothing to do with changes in space or movements in time. Kierkegaard's place at the extreme participant pole of our con tinuum of Gods is warranted by his statement that one may even despair of achieving communion with God provided one still HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 — FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="9">76 The Continuum of Gods and the Personalities of Men craves ardently the inward reunion with God,13 In this he joins Beckett and Dostoevsky in the renunciation of the presence of God so long as the longing for Him remains. Kierkegaard's "leap of faith" constitutes, therefore, the renunciation of the "world historic" aims of temporal achievement as well as the waiver of the fulfillment by communion with Divinity. The Divine revela tion through this leap of faith may still be sustained by the "will," which is Kierkegaard's way of expressing the quest for an "ethical," that is direct and inward relationship with God. Kierkegaard hardly needs to project his subjectivity onto God because his inner self is God. The Godless Enlightenment Another extreme participant group of religions quite close to the Tantalic pole of our continuum is the one of Far Eastern creeds which do not postulate a God or Gods but study and teach techniques of extrication, liberation and extasis from spatio temporality. Tao, "The Way, starts with a via negativa. One has to nihilate one's temporal existence by inaction (Wit-Wei), inattention and aimlessness, in order to discover the wholeness of nothingness." Taoism advocates also the liberation from the fetters of socio normativeness and especially from the "cleverness" of the successful arriviste. After discarding of the social norms and the obliteration of cognition, one is confronted with Tao which is the omnipresent void. Another godless creed of enlightenment which also belongs near the participant pole of our continuum is Buddhism. However, the brand which belongs here is the Hinayana (little vehicle) Buddhism of the Pali Canon which postulates techniques for the achievement of the non-being of quietist nirvana. The Mahayana (great vehicle) Buddhism is more varied, pluralistic and is mostly pantheistic, whereas Zen Buddhism is even more separant and we shall deal with both these creeds further on our continuum. Like the Tao, Hinayana Buddhism is the transcendental pro jection of the participant yearning to revert back to pre-birth nothingness. The methods to achieve this are the upaya which are the four noble truths, and the eightfold path. The first truth is that "the true self is non-self,"M meaning that the ego-boundary has to be dissolved and the separate awareness obliterated in order to be ready for the awakening of non-being. The second HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="10">S. Giora Shoharn 77 noble truth is the realization that in spatio-temporality we are in the grip of the illusory and deceiving Maya. We have to wake up from our ignorance (Avidya) that the subject is separate from the object and realize that in the true underlying reality behind the veil of Maya subject and object fuse into the unity of non-being. The third truth is the release from the Samsera wheel of life cycles and the routine of temporal existence by reaching nirvana which is the ultimate quietist goal of the absolute cessation (nir) of movement (vritti). With no movements there are no relationships and without relations both space and time collapse into the nothingness of pre-being. The fourth noble truth embodies the eightfold path to Dharma, which culminates in the pure awareness and revelation that the dualism of the knower and the known does not hold any longer and the unified one point awareness (dhyana) flows and rests into the profound peace of nothingness. Another Far Eastern creed which belongs in the godless pole of our continuum is the Hindu Samkhya. Some equate it with Yoga, yet these two Hindu orthodox systems (dansanas) are quite different for our purposes. Samkhya is godless whereas Yoga postulates the existence of Isvara the Supreme God.15 The Samkhya liberation or release (moksa) is achieved when the purusa the non-embodied soul recognizes its apartness from profane matter (prakrti) and manages to disentangle itself from it. We have discussed up to now some representative instances of godless creeds at the participant tail of our continuum of gods which may be presented as shown on the following page. We shall now proceed to examine some instances of emana tionist religions postulating the transition from a divine nothingness to a profane historic existence. This, we claim, is a transcendental projection of the catastrophic expulsion through birth from the autarchic self sufficience in utero to the savage deprivational interaction with the elements and life forms outside it. Lurianic Kabbala and some of the teachings of the Gnostics envisage birth as a catastrophe and project it onto transcendence as a cosmic disaster. The Kabbala postulates the Tikkun, "the mending" of the "broken vessels" which gave birth to the exile of spatio temporality and implies thereby that salvation is inherent in the nihilation of Man's thrownness into the temporal world. Gnosis regards the created world as a prison in which the convicts seek to HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="11">The Continuum of Gods and the Personalities of Men * o . d — i— , /T) i—t- cd n&gt; ~*0 x •—• ~ ^ p h.

Giora Shoham 79 escape the oppressive yoke of the vigilant archons and rejoin the eternal boundless "light" outside it. The Gnostic "good" God is an "alien" God and the "good" life is "alien" to spatio-temporality and outside it. The Mandaean Hymns thus start their incantations "in the name of the great first alien life from the worlds of light, the sublime that stands above all works." And Marcian preaches in the name of an alien, nameless, hidden and unknown God. Man is thrown in to the vile world of creation which is so unbearably painful in comparison with the blissful contentedness in utero that its metaphysical projection is of a deity entirely distinct from the "alien" god of pre-created non-being. Evil temporal existence cannot be attributed to the same good God. Hence spatio temporality has been created by a vile God who is the irrecon cilable enemy of the alien God of light. Also the extremely participant Gnostic religion envisages the "alien soul" of man ever longing to leave its vile body and return to its pre-creation purity. Plato's conception of divinity is inconsistent and it varies from one dialogue to another. However, in the Timaeus he conceives the everlasting unchangeable and non-concrete God which can not and does not have any relationships with the world-soul which also includes spatiotemporal creation. There is also a demiurgos which is timeless and is above the world-soul. This resembles mutatis-mutandis, the dualism of Gnosis and the Kabbala except that the relationship of the world-soul in the Platonic system to the Godhead is rather unclear. However, a fully fledged emanationist system has been developed by the neo platonists and especially by Plotinus. He envisages a hierarchy of the One from which emanates the Nous, the cosmic intelligence which radiates the world-soul which creates and controls the temporal world. The Plotinic system, however, is highly sophisticated in its con ceptual neatness and streamlined construction of the emana tionist metamorphoses. The transition from the austere non being of unity through the cognition of Nous and world-soul to the plurality of objects and life forms has marked similarities with our separant vector catapulting man from the unity of omnipresent non-being through the deprivational interaction with the elements outside it, to the embodiment of the separate self at orality and later to the confining strictures of social norms. Our participant vector is also present in the system of Plotinus in so far as he envisages all beings and all objects as striving to HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="13">80 The Continuum uj Gods and the Personalities oj Men reunite back into unity. We may present the continuum of projected transcendences as emerging from our deliberations up to the present stage as follows on the next page. The Pantheistic Mystics In pantheism one is in all and all is in one. God is in all creation and all the world is in God. The Following passage from the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas expresses the pantheistic belief as follows: I am the light which is over all of them; I am the all; the All has gone out from me and the All has reached me. Split wood, I am there; take up the stone, and you will find me there."16 In our context, pantheism represents the metaphysical projection of early orality when the neonate still feels at one with everything and an omnipresence which identifies all his surroundings with the engulfing unit of himself. Spinoza's pantheism is expressed in his famous dictum that "whatever is, is in God and nothing can exist or be conceived without God."17 There is, however, a gradation of the "modes" of the created world which are finite yet within the context of the infinity of God. Unio Mystica Mysticism is an intuitive non-rational feeling of an immediate exposure to God and partaking in Him. This is the participant mode of mysticism. Institutionalized religion which is largely separant and theistic recognizes the authority of a God outside creation who controls and manipulates it like a Deus ex machina. The conflict between institutionalized religion and mysticism is inevitable because the priest, the rabbi or the ayatolla are reluctant to relinquish their role and position as agents annointed by God and authorized by the Almighty to handle His worldly interests. It is amazing to note how similar the aims and means of unio mystica are in the various mystical creeds. The names of the mystical goals vary widely and so do the forms and structures of their techniques but their essence and inner dynamics are almost HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS — VOL. 12 NO. 1 — FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="14">S.

The Hindu Moksa, the Buddhist Nirvana and the Sufi Fana have virtually the same goal which Agehananda Bharati calls "the zero content of cognitive experience,"18 which in our context means to annul spatiotemporal awareness in order to re experience the omnipresence of nondifferentiated pantheism. As for the techniques of mysticism Bharati says "fasting, prayer, drugs, self mortification, fornication, standing on his head, grace, listening to Tristan and Isolde unabridged three times in a row...whatever leads to the zero experience is good.'"9 Whatever blunts spatiotemporal awareness of plurality and makes one ready for the feeling of partaking in unity is an effective mystical technique. Whereas Hinayana Buddhism is godless emanationist creed Mahayana Buddhism seems to be pantheistic. Nirvana the wholeness of non-being may thus be attained according to the Mahayana doctrine within the Samsara wheel of spatiotemporal existence. The Tantalic nature of Mahayanic pantheism is apparent from its doctrine that although there are no real separate egos and in true reality all individuals and multiple objects intermingle in a pantheistic whole, yet citta (mind) is not attainable. Revelatory Nirvana may be longed for and this longing in itself may be the basis for a creed even if the actual immersion into the spiritual whole of the pantheistic omnipresence of early orality is not reachable. Zen is more of a way of life than a godless religion. It is a way of liberation from the fetters of spatiotemporality while being within the drudgeries of daily existence. In the Hindu pantheon of varied Gods and religions, there is quite a discernible strain of pantheism. Vishnu is thus described as being within everything in space and time and permeating all objects and life forms. The Brahman may appear in various shapes and forms but it is all just different manifestations of a single substance of cognition which permeates both the overt world and the covert universal unity. A specific instance in Hindu Pantheism is the teachings of Sankara which are mainly based on the pantheistic premises of the Upanishads and the Bhadavad Gita. Brahman, for Sankara, is the self of every individual. The self awareness of each separatum is actually the awareness of the single Brahman because "he is the one God, hidden in all beings, all pervading, HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS — VOL. 12 NO. 1 — FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="16">S. Giora Shoham 83 the self within all beings, the witness, the perceiver, the only one." This is the pantheistic omnipresence of early orality. The single universal Brahman appears as multiplicity, and as the duality of subject and object through the illusions created by nescience. A representative instance of pantheism in Judaism is the teachings of the quietist Hasidim who believed that once they annihilated their separate existence and melted back into God, all reality would consist of an omnipresent Divinity. God is embedded, or rather imprisoned, in Man (as well as in all crea tion). When man annihilates himself he releases the presence of God within him back to his pantheistic omnipresence. This long ing for pantheism should be stressed, according to the Maggid of Mesherich in the daily prayer of "Hear O Israel the Lord our God is one." The accentuation of the One in this prayer is to declare that God is omnipresent in the whole of creation and to beseech Him that the separation of the individual self should be abrogated.20 However, the Maggid realized the Tantalic nature of the longing for pantheism which is ever present yet never realized. Meister Eckhart seems to be an apt illustration of Christian mystics who demonstrate the pantheistic projection on transcendence. For Eckhart "God is the great self-sharer." The Divine Presence permeates the self and one may find God in all things. Moslem mystical Sufism has some marked pantheistic traits. The martyred Mansur al-Hallaj who declared "Ana al Haqq" (I am the truth) and was crucified for it, actually declared his pantheistic conviction that he and God (the truth) are one. His last words before his execution were "Oh my God, who are revealed in every place and who art not in any place."21 This is the projection on metaphysics of the omnipresence of early oral pantheism when the pre-differentiated non-being was within everything and everything was within it. Al Ghazali who was one of the most important orthodox and institutionalized Moslem theologians, describes in a judge penitent manner a la Camus in The Fall, his conversion to pantheistic Sufism through which he sought a sense of oneness with God. Panentheistic Duos Panentheistic creeds as classified and described by Hartshorne and Reese conceive God as both an eternal and temporal HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL7WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="17">84 The Continuum of Gods unci the Personalities of Men consciousness knowing and including the world in His manifest actualization but not in His essence.22 What it means is that the finite temporal world constitutes a part of the eternal and infinite God. The created world constitutes, therefore, a manifest part of the attributeless divinity. Panentheism occupies thence the segment of our continuum in which the infinite atemporal early orality is coagulated into a finite temporal and separate self and projected onto transcendence. It also includes the dividing line between the totality of preseparation and the formation of an individuum confronted by a plurality of objects and life forms. Panentheism contains, therefore, both a boundless essence as projected on it from early oraiity and a concrete self as projected on it right after the crystallization of the ego boundary which marks the beginning of later orality. Once the nascent self is expelled into historicity and plurality it longs to reunite with all the other objects and life forms but from now on not in a partici pant manner of melting into them but by trying to "swallow," overpower and internalize them in a separant Sisyphean manner. On the post separation side of panentheism we find Leibniz's view that each individual sees the world from the point of view of vantage of his different "monad" which is the part of God embedded in every man, life form and object.23 Leibniz regards the plurality of objects and life forms with the separant value judgment that this is "the best of all possible worlds." Moreover each separatum has a direct line to God because every monad is linked to divinity as to a central exchange. Consequently, the em bodied part of the panentheistic scheme which is the concretized manifestation of finite temporality is still linked to predifferen tiated boundlessness by the particles of spirituality and "souls" embedded in the multiple life forms and even objects. Yet the coagulation of the separate self as projected on panentheism makes for a dualistic view of transcendence: God is both within me and outside of me. This internal and external view stemming from the crystallization of a separate self from the boundlessness of early orality, is projected on transcendence as a dimorphism of creation and God posited on the two sides of the ego boundary. Plato's metaphysical system, at least as presented by him in The Timeaus, is quite dualistic and fits into the panentheistic segment of our continuum. His everlasting, boundless and immutable God is abstract and would correspond to the early oral non-crystallized projection of the self whereas the world soul which contains the concrete and finite created world corresponds HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="18">S. Giora Shoham 85 to the projection of the embodied and ego boundaried self. The actual process of the coagulation of the ego boundaried self out of the omnipresence of nondifferentiation is registered by the organism as both contained and boundless, finite and infinite. This is the admixture in the transitional phase of the nascent self of concommittant elements of both being and non being which is felt as conflicting adverse powers within the self. The clearest instance of the metaphysical projection of this developmental transition is Zoroastrianism. The Zoroastrian Ahurmiz, constituting the good mind, the best existence, the holy spirit, corresponds to the timeless, infinite, ethereal and abstract early orality, whereas the timebound and hence doomed creatures of Ahriman correspond to the depraved temporal existence of the individual human separatum. The mytho-empirical basis for our conception of the coagula tion of the separate self as a fall from grace and for the thicken ing of the ego boundary as layers of scar tissue formed by the deprivational interaction of the nascent ego with its sur roundings, was dealt with us extensively elsewhere.24 We have traced there the Biblical account of the Original Sin, the fall from grace and its parallels in other religions. We showed that the developmental meaning of the fall was the embodiment of Adam "in the flesh" and the separation and isolation of the individual from his previously undifferentiated Edenic omnipresence. The separant individuation of the fall rendered Adam ontologically concrete and in competitive and deprivational conflict with his surroundings. The life on earth as an embodied individual is death to the boundlessness of Edenic non-differentiation. After differentia tion there is the basic existential duality of the 1 and the not-I. This differentiation underlies most dichotomies in religion, philosophy and human behavior very much like the fact that man has ten fingers on his hands forms the basis for the decimal system. However, right after the differentiation of the self at the beginning of later orality the relationship between the newly formed individual with his surroundings is still very strong because it learns through an intensive involvement with his surroundings the difference between what is himself and what is not himself. This relational involvement although separant because the self has already separated from the object, has still a strong participant component in it. When projected on transcendence this relational involvement may take the form of Buberian panentheism and the I-thou religion of dialogica. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="19">86 The Continuum of Gods and the Personalities of Men Indeed, for Buber the essence of being both temporal and transcendental is relational involvement. The temporal I-thou may become metaphysical with the I seeking relationship with the divine eternal thou. This longing for the revelatory and partici pant I-thou may deteriorate into the starkly separant and petrified 1-it relationship. What is important here is that the long ing of the newly separated individual for repartaking in unity is projected by Buberian panentheism as a quest for bridging over the rift between the individual and his surroundings by partaking in objects, life forms and ultimately in the absolute thou of god. The God From Heaven The theistic God is outside man and His other creatures.25 He is omnipotent, omniscient and controls all creation. This indeed is the projection of the post oral Sisyphean self onto transcendence and especially the quest of the separant core per sonality vector for total manipulation of the object unrealizable in the here and now but manifest in the perfection of God. Aristotelean theism conceiving God as a final cause and as a prime mover is in line with our conception of the Sisyphean object-manipulating theistic deity as a projection of the perfect goals of our separant personality core vector. Judaism, Christianity and Islam in their institutionalized manifestations are largely theistic. They elevate God to a celestial throne.26 He has created everything but He Himself is outside creation. He is all powerful, knows everything and manipulates the world and its creatures at will. The theistic God is not detached from the world but very much involved in it. He is the incarnation of His separant human projector's wildest competitive dreams. God is the most powerful, the most knowledgeable, the most resourceful and the everlasting. The theistic Divinity is not outside space and time but is the instrumental supremacy over spatiotemporality realized as absolute by the projected goals of the separant core personality vector. The theistic God has supreme authority in His relation ships with objects and life forms. This again is the projected quest of the Sisyphean arriviste to subdue his competitive surroundings. The theistic God knows every object and life form in His crea tion.27 This again is the separant individual's quest to know and hence to control everything in his environment projected on God HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="20">5. Giora Shoham 87 as absolute knowledge. For the Sisyphean separant to know the objective world is to have power over it in the Faustean sense and the most conspicuous characteristic of the theistic God is His power. He is the lord, the King, the omnipotent Majesty. This is the projection of the power craving separant to be the "strongest of them all." Familial Trios Jung examines the psychological sources of the trinity and starts with the Pythagorean assertion as to the perfection of the number three. One is the first from which all other numbers arise, and in which the opposite qualities of numbers, the odd and the even, must therefore be untied; two is the first even number; three the first that is uneven and perfect, because in it we first find beginning, middle, and end.28 Indeed, if dialectics is as potent and widespread as it seems to be, the synthesis is the third resulting from the interaction between the first and the second. In our context the trinity stands for the basic procreative triad of father, mother and child. The Christian trinity has the Holy Ghost instead of the mother because of the Christian overt aver sion to sex which we have explored elsewhere. Not so in the other creeds and mythologies who sanctify the trinity of the archetypal nuclear family of the father, mother and child. Some represen tative instances are the Egyptian trinity of Osiris, Isis and Horus and the Greek triad of Zeus, Semele and Dionysus. Our concern, however, is with the triadic nuclear family as projected on transcendence with the divine son/daughter having a religio normative status of their own vis-a-vis the created world and human society. This relates, naturally to our third social phase of separation where the adolescent offspring is pushed out of the protective family fold by means of rites-of-passage to bear the burdens of social responsibility. This placement within the mesh or pigeonholes of the normative system of society has been dealt with by us when we formulated the "Isaac Syndrome."" We have used the offering of Isaac as a mytho-empirical anchor for the normative separation and placement of adolescents and young adults outside the forgiving protection of HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="21">88 The Continuum of Gods and the Personalities of Men the family. Both Isaac and Jesus Christ have been willing, normative victims of the authoritarian separant mandates of the archetypal father. In similar vein Iphigenia was a willing victim to the normative patriotic mandates of Greece as imposed by her authoritarian father Agammemnon. All these are mytho empirical normative sacrifices which symbolize the harnessing of the young into their separant social burdens. Here we reached the segment of our continuum of Gods where we are nearing its separant extreme. The son-daughter who are normative success stories because they have willingly sacrificed themselves to the normative standards of their society through the authoritarian services of the father, are projected on transcendence as separant son-Gods and martyred redeemers. A Worldful of Gods Polytheism is the most separant form of religion. It constitutes the metaphysically projected strife of man in a world dominated by the competition of multitudes of creatures for lebensraum, by the violence of achievement driven humans and the viscissitudes of success and failure as attributed to skill, fate or chance. The "true" polytheistic creeds anchor on a heirarchy of multiple gods corresponding to the forces and phenomena of nature, social institutions, norms and values and the forms of human inter action. On the typical polytheistic creeds the various Gods in the hierarchy represent some specialized dominion which epitomizes the skill in a given specialization and displays the maximum of power in a given area. Each God is a superman in his realm performing to perfection the projected separant human aims, quests and dreams in an omnipotent and omniscient manner not available to mortals. The polytheistic God is the fulfillment of the Sisyphean personality's phantasies of achievement as envisioned by his separant core vector, anything he can do the God can do better. Indeed, many times humans and the anthropomorphic polytheistic Gods unevenly compete for the same temporal aims and earthly trophies. In the typically polytheistic creeds all objects, life forms, processes and relationships are represented in the pantheon, jostling, pushing, fighting each other and befriending, loving and copulating with one another very much like their human projectors. Polytheistic creeds are varied and many, ranging from the HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984 85</page><page sequence="22">jj Giora Shoham 89 religions of the ancient Near East, through Greece and Rome, to modern India and the Wakan spirit deities of the Dakota Indians. However, the most extreme separant polytheism in the sense of our present work is the religion of ancient Greece which will therefore serve us as a typical case of a most extreme Sisyphean creed. Gilbert Murray has taught us that Greek religion has undergone quite discernible developmental phases,30 from the pre-Olympian "Age of Ignorance" to the Hellenistic absorption of oriental creeds. Naturally many elements of participant creeds could be identified in these phases, e.g. the Orphic mysticism and the emanationist new platonism. However, the extreme separant polytheistic religion is the classic stage of the great Olympian gods which will serve as our model. The Greek Gods are ideals and hence the projected craving in the separant core vectors of Greek men. Zeus, for instance is the controller of the weather and for an agrarian people this is an all important function which might explain his primacy in the Greek pantheon. In a pragmatic activist society work (for a considera tion) is divine. Hence, Apollo herded the cattle of Admetus and Apollo and Poseidon built the walls of Troy. Apollo is also a fighter, a projection of the invincible aggressor in man. Except for his mother Leto and for Zeus all the Olympians are afraid of him. The Olympian Gods always fight or conquer somebody or something.31 They play, fornicate, laugh, compete for money, power and dames. They gossip, slander and ridicule one another. They live the "good life," the do/ce vita, of the upper classes the "beautiful people," and the "jet set." Everything is external ized, hedonized, glorified, inflated to monstrous proportions like a giant budget cinematic saga of the life and loves of the upper crust projected onto eternity. The Olympian gods play the pro jected ideal roles of individuals in a perfectly separant society: competitive, cruel, "each one for himself" without the scruples of guilt, the checks and balances of justice and the mitigations of grace. The Greek Olympian pantheon seems to be dominated by male chauvinist pigs. Yet the separant pragmatic realism is apparent here also. Olympus is very much family centered. The males are loud, boisterous, displaying their energies and prowess, yet the Greek goddess, like her woman projector, had mostly the trump card. She manages, more often than not, to manipulate her man, by love, cunning and emotional blackmail to have it her way. The organization of the world by the Olympian Gods was HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="23">90 The Continuum of Gods and the Personalities of Men based on a power control of the cosmos. The more powerful gods apportioned some controlling powers to their subordinates and these relegated fiefs to their vassals until the whole world was organized into a hierarchial system of controls. The Greeks knew that a disturbance of this system in balance could lead to mental instability, somatic diseases and insanity. Moreover, a disharmony between these opposing vectors leading to a breaking up of the balance would lead to excesses and social deviance punishable by man with ostracism and by gods and furies who are the guardians of the separant metaphysical coor dination of the cosmos and its life forms by the "golden rule" of the "golden mean." After surveying its various components we may present our continuum of Gods as a projection of the human personality continuum as follows: (see pages 91-92) HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="24">S.
