DOI 10.17990/RPF/2017_73_2_0717 Ways of Subordinating God to Human Beings in  Early Modern Philosophy: A General Overview with  Special Attention to the Role played by Mathematics in  Cartesian Epistemology* VIOREL VIZUREANU** Abstract Our paper focuses, from a philosophical standpoint, on a defining phenomenon of modernity  which we will call the subordination of God to the human being. It concerns a complex  and subtle phenomenon, mainly involuntary, due to the fact that many philosophical  strategies were meant to reinforce a declining presence of God in the general framework  of human knowledge. Subsequently, we chose to exemplify this kind of approaches through  the peculiar place occupied by mathematics in modern philosophy, especially in the 17th  century, by making appeal mainly to the works of Descartes, from a perspective which might  be called of a Heideggerian inspiration. We will see that even in this narrower context, the  aforementioned subordination is not simple or unequivocal, but one that possesses multiple  aspects or ways through which it is confirmed. And, of course, speaking in a strictly scientific  manner (for the sake of rigor), we have to limit for the time being the conclusions of our  interpretation only to the latter (Cartesian) context. Keywords: constructivism, Descartes, early modern philosophy, God, mathematics. The purpose of our work is twofold. Firstly, we will try to paint a schematic picture of the background in which we believe was realized what we could call, from a philosophical standpoint, the  subordination of God to the human being, during the first centuries of  modernity, especially through the development of a new model of scien- tific knowledge. It is equally important to notice that this ‘philosophical  secularization’ (or secularization through philosophy) took place even in  * The author wishes to thank the anonymous reviewer for her very useful suggestions  and corrections. ** Institute of Philosophy and Psychology “C.

Secondly, we will focus our research by illustrating this process in  a – we hope – coherent manner through the role played by mathematics in  modern philosophy, especially in the 17th century, in particular in Descartes’  work. We will see that even in this narrower context, the aforementioned  subordination is not simple or unequivocal, but one that possesses multiple  aspects or ways through which it is confirmed. It must be stressed that  mathematics offers just one of the epistemological „strategies” of the  self (subject) developed within this complex process. Moreover, we will  briefly show that mathematics goes through an epistemological and also  an ontological modification of its status, being transformed from a mere  expression or approximation of transcendence into one of the preferred  forms of manifestation of the subject. To oversimplify it, mathematics will  represent, from now on, the self, it will be, before everything, a truth of the  subject, a proof of its cognitive powers.  All the above-mentioned things presuppose, on the whole, not only a  systematization of the concerned elements as they were depicted by other  historians of philosophical ideas, but also a bringing to light of some  paths, up until now well-hidden, through which this subordination took  place. This bringing to light doesn’t mean in this context the uncovering  of some new ‘contents’, but the interpretation of some ‘old’ textual facts,  many of them already well-known.  A clarification should be made here, one according to which, besides  some elements which are very often mentioned in an obsessive manner,  there are numerous other components contained within modernity  –  understood as a process of secularization –, whose ‘potential for under- mining’ is not as investigated as it should be. Various central ideas of the  concerned period might seem ‘innocent’, meaning that we appreciate  them as being purely objective or only technical, limited to evolutions only  in the internal sphere of science. Only in this light should the detailed  analysis which we apply to the significance of mathematics be understood  during the aforementioned historical period – and we admit that for some  such an endeavor might seem (very) suspicious. We could go even further  and state that we can not identify what could be called ‘ideas with neutral  value’ in the (re)configuration of the relationship of modern man with  divine reality – unfortunately, due to space constraints, we can not offer a  more detailed justification for this statement.

Essentially, the choice itself of the ideal of objectivity and its continuous  transformation represents the expression of the power of human beings  of deciding with regard to their own destiny, which is an expression of  human freedom (in its modern understanding) and – following in Kant’s  footsteps – of man’s emergence from immaturity. ‘The Copernican revo- lution’ discussed by the same philosopher is the most suggestive image in  this respect. To put it shortly, this de-anthropologization mainly represents  the concrete sign of the modern re-anthropologization of knowledge, a  reaffirmation of what it is to be human on a different, superior level within  an Enlightenment-inspired reading.  The same explicative mechanism could also be invoked for what  could be called the de-anthropologization of the self (otherwise put, we  are not here dealing with the empirical, psychological self, seen from the  perspective of the ‘concrete man’, but from a transcendental-cognitive  one), which was considered consonant with the de-anthropologization of  the ideal of science above-mentioned.3 In other words, we observe here  modern man’s maneuver resulting in seeing and perceiving himself from  a scientific perspective, as a source / basis of scientificity itself, of ‘objec- tifying’ itself in the form of a knowing subject (and thus the subject of –  1.

We use the term in a sense close to the one established by the Heideggerian concept  of anthropologization of modern metaphysics.

Finally, we believe we can also see here the effect of a return of  man on himself, a reshaping / redefinition of humanity that he himself  produces based on the form of his knowledge which he designates as the  expression of his own cognitive certainties (essentially, the recognized  certainty of the mathematical truth). Which, again, comes back to saying  once again that this de-anthropologization of the self represents, in the  same time, a re-anthropologization of a special kind, a kind of purifi- cation (scientific or transcendental, in a broad sense) of the self operated  on itself. The above-mentioned consonance represents, then, the double  reciprocal conditioning which is realized by the self alongside modern  science: science finally abandons the demands of capturing the ultimate  truths of the world (of the world-in-itself), while the self is built by itself in  conformity with the demands of reality’s (modern) scientificity. Only this  way could the human being become the basis of knowledge in a twofold  manner: as a precise structure of (in)formation of (science’s) theory of  reality and as an epistemological decision of searching for those founda- tions in himself.  However, we would like to draw attention, from the very beginning,  to the fact that we do not want to reduce all the endeavors of modern  philosophy to a sole model, be it a complex one. Pascal’s case, for example,  is too well-known for being easily caught in such an explicative scheme.4  All we are trying to illustrate in this study is the existence of a predom- inant, perhaps even overwhelming movement of reflexive practices in the  frameworks of modern Occidental philosophy – and its existence as such  4. However, in our opinion, even the (critical) reflections on the modern endeavors of  rationalistic philosophy – in a broad sense – be they “existential” (pasCaL, Kierkegaard),  “sentimentalist” (Rousseau, Chateaubriand), “romantic” (the Jena romanticism, partly  Schleiermacher, etc.), share some essential features which brings them near to those  just enumerated. Perhaps, the common key factor that we have to relate to constantly  in all these cases is the one of subjectivity. Heidegger, for example, in the continuation  of a process of historical hermeneutics that has Hegel and Nietzsche as forerunners,  sees in modern philosophy a “philosophy of the subject”, thus talking, for example,  about “the dominance of the subject in the modern age” (title of one of his sections  Nietzsche, Vol. IV, 96-101; GA 6.2 124-129).  Returning to our warning that caused this note, we should mention that in such  historical approaches it is perfectly possible to find in the pre-modern period promoters  of the ideas  – typically modern  – highlighted here. They can even be seen to have  exercised punctual, palpable influences on modern thinkers. Again, what is decisive  in our analysis is the attempt of finding tendencies / currents and not only exponents /  isolated individuals who circulated those ideas.

As such, we can not wish to affirm that  all modern philosophers, that all philosophers who activated in what  is called – not unproblematically!  – (early) modernity, are exponents or  promoters of such a model.  But, in its essential points, the history of modern philosophy is a  proof for such a consonance. So, as Kirk observes,  In different ways, Descartes, Locke and Kant recognized some  need to postulate the ‘existence’ of God, if their respective epis- temological and moral theories were going to succeed. However,  such a token belief amounts to little more than an anthropomorphic  projection of God, as a methodological device, to meet certain needs,  whether these are cognitive, emotive, cultural, social or religious. (my  italics)5 1. A short (and somewhat speculative) intermezzo. What is the  place of God in (a) modern philosophy? And, also, what kind of  God is it? A special look at Descartes  Before properly starting our analysis I would like to invoke a certain,  somehow puzzling, attitude experienced by many readers relative to God’s  presence in the frameworks of modern philosophy, which we will exem- plify by making appeal to Cartesian thinking. But, it must be stressed,  beyond the renown of Cartesian philosophy, this type of reaction could be  linked to the quasi-totality of endeavors of Occidental thinkers belonging  to that epoch, regardless of their religion,6 if one assumes that religion  could be a decisive factor in this matter.  I would like to invoke a longer passage belonging to John Cottingham,  who has the merit of capturing in detail this state of affairs which could be  easily experimented by a new reader of the Cartesian works, in as much as  he will start from the canonical image in the Anglo-Saxon world according  to which Descartes, is above all a secular philosopher. A priori system- builder, advocate of “Cartesian privacy,” philosopher of mind, epistemol- ogist, proto-scientist – all these images fit, for the most part, as models or  5. J.

We should, only in passing, stress the fact that Descartes was a Catholic, Spinoza was  of Jewish origins and Leibniz was a Protestant.

But if readers who are new to Descartes pick up any one of his  great masterpieces, the Discourse, the Meditations, or the Principles, they  will be surprised to find that what has pride of place in the construction  of his philosophical system is something that is almost never found in  today’s typical research agendas – an appeal to God. Within contemporary  philosophy departments there are still, of course, a considerable number  of academics who discuss arguments for God’s existence and other  topics concerned with religious belief; but their work, for the most part,  occurs within the confines of a specialized branch of philosophy called  “philosophy of religion,” and as a general rule it tends not to spill over into  the content of the “mainstream” arguments and debates that preoccupy  those working in the rest of the subject. For Descartes, by contrast, the  nature and existence of the Deity is something that lies at the very heart  of his entire philosophical system – something without which it would be  entirely unrecognizable.7 Several questions, occasioned by reading these passages from  Cottingham, will pop into our mind. What does the presence of God, as  a nominal appearance in the text and as an unavoidable metaphysical  position in the argumentation, express in Cartesian philosophy? Could  this presence / position be hidden, as in the interpretations invoked by  Cottingham (which constitute, in his terms, an ‘eclipse’ of God in the  interpretations of Cartesianism)? Or are these attempts in themselves the  expression of the fact that the profoundness of Cartesian philosophy could  be obtained even by ‘renouncing God’? Why are those philosophers, to  whom Cottingham makes a reference to, inclined to ignore “his arguments  and assertions about God (...) as irrelevant to the central core of modern  mainstream philosophy, or, perhaps, as what they take to be an embar- rassing hangover from the medieval world view that still conditioned the  way Descartes was brought up”?8 Otherwise put, could we talk about a present, but in the same time, still  absent God? Is it a God whose presence (be it textually nominal or meta- physically real) in fact induces the feeling (or perception) of an absence?  Or maybe this divine ‘presence’ under the form of some regularities that  guide, in an ubiquitous and immutable manner, the behavior of all things,  7.

After all, isn’t what Cottingham affirms just a reiteration, after many  centuries, of Pascal’s sentiment stirred up by the realization that Descartes’  need for God is – in essence – just an intellectual one? In a famous passage,  he was confessing that “I cannot forgive Descartes. In all his philosophy he  would have been quite willing to dispense with God. But he had to make  Him give a fillip to set the world in motion; beyond this, he has no further  need of God.”9 In a way, all the above-mentioned things could be translated through  the existence of a mechanistic homogeneous universe, from which the  extra-ordinary presence of miracles and wonders is eliminated. Descartes  explicitly affirms that modern man possesses a priori knowledge as a  fundamental manner of expressing himself and as a way of eliminating  any possibility that this essential determination be affected, „we shall (...)  suppose in addition that God will never perform any miracle in the new  world, and that the intelligences, or the rational souls, which we might  later suppose to be there, will not disrupt in any way the ordinary course  of nature.”10 Coming back to the observation which accompanied Pascal’s  quotation, an intellectual need (be it metaphysical, epistemological, moral  or political and so on11) is a need which appears as a consequence of some  internal and inherent constraints of the use of reason which precedes  through its purposes and decision the apparition in the discourse of a  reality (i.e. God) necessary to its own evolution. In a way, our analysis is  also an answer, multiple in its internal unfoldings, offered to these kinds  of perplexities.12 9. Blaise pasCaL, Pensées, trans. W.F.

And if the first primary subordination would  also seem ‘unconscious’, the second one will be, if not conscious, then  at least ‘subconscious’, i.e. a present thing which we could acknowledge  through a supplementary reflexive effort, but which we would pass by  without grasping its true significance. Which means that maybe, in a para- doxical way, modern man wishes for himself this manner of forgetting (or  of cognitively secularizing...) God.  The key term which would impose itself in this context is irrelevance.  Talking about the role God plays within the Cartesian theory of knowledge,  Schouls affirms that [i]n effect, Descartes’ argument entails the non-existence of a deceiving  god (because “divinity” and “deception” cannot coexist in the same being)  as well as the irrelevance of a veracious god (both because the limitation  of omnipotence is a contradiction in terms and because reason cannot  establish its own trustworthiness and that of the senses).13 theology (...) the concept of God permeates his philosophy and is indispensable to  his project. One can hardly imagine a more religious doctrine than the one we have  just examined, that the universe is continuously saved from oblivion by God’s creative  act. Still, I think it is fair to say that Descartes always puts God in the service of some  pressing metaphysical or scientific problem, rather than vice-versa. The doctrine of  continuous creation should be understood in this light, serving as an effective guard  against the re-introduction of scholastic ideas into modern physics. For if God literally  recreates the entire universe at each instant, preserving all the motions in all the  bodies, then there is nothing left for vital forces, substantial forms, and the like, to do.  In this sense Pascal is right that Descartes needed God only «in order to set the world  in motion»”, Geoffrey gorHaM, “Cartesian Causation: Continuous, Instantaneous,  Overdetermined,” Journal of the History of Philosophy 42, no. 4 (October 2004): 423. 13.

Once again, the problem is not if God appears, but how he  appears in philosophical argumentation. God reveals himself in Descartes’  writings as an epistemological guarantor (of a capacity of seeing the truth  which somehow works ‘by itself’) and, we might be over-speculating, as a  not-present parent (never seen), ‘presumed’ in its continuous presence or  as the expression of an epistemological need of reinventing transcendence  (so not as a presence, as a positivity, as a given).  We will linger a little bit more on the case of the same philosopher and  on the irrelevance of the presence of God within his philosophical frame- works. As Della Rocca observes, „God is, for Descartes, non-threatening  despite being all-powerful; or rather, non-threatening precisely because  he is all-powerful.”15 When we research the traits or concrete behavior of  finite things, „it is almost as if God doesn’t exist, (...) we can proceed freely  without worrying about bumping into God or stepping on his toes, as it  were.”16 More aspects could be stressed in Della Rocca’s observations. First of  all, this “as if God does not exist” does not mean that we are dealing here  (as in the case of the majority of modern philosophers) with an insincere  attempt concerning divinity. It only concerns the way in which God’s  presence is restricted in its apparition and ‘functioning’ within the frame- works of a new philosophy, especially within epistemology, which plays a  central, determining role. Then, it is possible to consider – in Descartes’ works – that the relation  of creatures with God is an overwhelmingly metaphysical one,17 but as long  as it can not be apprehended, hence it can not be cognitively analyzed, it  simply disappears from the horizon of a detailed philosophical investi- gation. It does not even lead to the development of a complex, speculative,  14. Ibid. 15.

We could thus say that Descartes opens the way – or, as Della Rocca  maintains, he makes some “crucial steps” – for a secularized epistemology  which will be the defining trait of modernity in its whole and which we  will encounter afterwards at philosophers such as Hume and Kant. In the  words of the same Della Rocca, “Descartes is (...) preparing the way for the  development of accounts of freedom, substance, causation and modality  that proceed without any invocation of God, accounts that proceed inde- pendently of God.”19 But it is not a question regarding a simple “prepa- ration” or “suggestion” of a road to follow – „the most surprising part of  all this is, perhaps, that these points also apply to Descartes’ epistemology.  In some way, Descartes is starting to make room for the view that episte- mology can proceed without concerning itself with God.”20 Further on, it means that this ‘divorce’ between God and epistemology  is not however complete in Descartes’ writings. We could also add that, at  least at a certain stage of modernity,21 this break up won’t be a total one,  even for those philosophers in whose works the presence of God is much  less felt than in Descartes’ oeuvre.  Anyway, the general observation of Della Rocca fixes as the initial  point of reflection the same puzzling attitude mentioned by Cottingham:  “the paradoxical and intriguing aspect of Descartes’ view here is that he  takes these steps in the context of an epistemology that is explicitly theo- centric in so many ways.”22 We will say more about modern epistemology and, in particular, the  Cartesian one and its role in the modification of the links between human  beings and divinity in the following section.  18. After all, we could envisage that such a “developed” or “complex” apophatism is  an ontological one, i.e. one that places God as a unique trigger of philosophical /  theological interrogation (as did, for example, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite). The  first purpose of the philosophical discourse would be given, in the latter case, by the  possibility of speaking with God, not just through the securing of our knowledge, but  within the ideatic frameworks of modernity.  19.

The amplitude of  the subject constrains us to treat here only what we called the subordi- nation through epistemology (or epistemological subordination), and  only relative to the contribution of the role played by mathematics, as  it is understood by modern philosophers (especially Descartes). We are  thus forced to leave behind alternative or complementary manners of  subordination, like the ones accomplished through ontology or historical  discourse, as well as other epistemological tracks, like the one given by the  generalization of efficient causality.23  2. The epistemological subordination of God  This section, dedicated to the role played by epistemological elements  in what we called the subordination of God in modernity, constitutes the  central point of our present argumentation. We do not want to imply that  all the other aspects mentioned above are not important, but only that in  our opinion there are much more proofs, from this perspective, for the  process discussed. Maybe, all this multitude can not but illustrate a very  scattered reading of modern philosophy, in which the latter is understood  as essentially sharing an epistemological tint. Modernity presupposes, to  put it shortly, what could be called an epistemologizing ontology.24 To a great extent, as we shall see, this process is due to the role played  by mathematics within the new philosophy’s frameworks. But mathe- matics played a role in the configuration of philosophical reflection since  Antiquity (it is not probably by accident that the man who is considered to  be the first philosopher, Thales, is also seen as the first one who developed  deductive reasoning in mathematics, the first proper mathematician), so  it would be more adequate to talk about the new role played now by math- ematics, or about its profound cognitive re-signification which started in  the 17th century.  Evidently, the importance of this phenomenon was also considered  central and stressed by many commentators before. Hence, Heidegger  shows  – in What is a Thing? (Die Frage nach dem Ding)  – that none of  23. Which will constitute the object of a further article.  24.

He  thinks that the fundamental trait of modern science is given by the fact  that it is a mathematised science.25 Heidegger markedly invokes here – by  considering it as not sufficiently well understood in its initial message –  one of Kant’s affirmations in Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science  (Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft), according to which  “I assert, however, that in any special doctrine of nature there can be only  as much proper science as there is mathematics therein.”26 Our contribution in this sense opens the way for a multiple inter- pretation, by way of emphasizing a direct (which is, somehow, “in light”)  subordination of God and also a series of less visible (somehow hidden)  subordinations at a first sight, which we will call indirect.  3. The direct subordination of God through the development of  the epistemological process  The idea that in modern philosophy in general we can find a subor- dination of God to the structure, basic premises and aims of the cognitive  approach of human beings is for many historians of philosophy a common  one. Naturally, as we have already mentioned, in this case, Descartes’  gesture could be appreciated as an exemplary one. He conceives the  fundamental act of philosophy as an endeavor which has the certainty  of its own knowledge as a central, primal objective. Otherwise put, we  can find here the founding cognitive decision which leaves deep traces  in the metaphysical scheme of modernity. To put it shortly, this founding  centrality of subjectivity in Descartes opens the possibility of interrogating  the character of the principle of knowledge of God’s existence, as well as  the circularity attributed to its philosophy.  In a certain sense, there is no need to decide, through rigorous argu- mentation, the aspects contained within the concerned philosophical  25. See Martin Heidegger, What is a Thing?, trans. W.B.

It is sufficient to keep in mind  the prior observation, according to which such an endeavor opens the  possibility of contesting the place occupied by God in knowledge. Some of  the central elements of this situation are very well stressed by Dougherty,  when he points out the fact that using the term “principle” for God’s exis- tence opens the way for its equivocal use for at least two reasons. First  of all, because we can doubt its existence as a principle – that it is thus  subject to a methodological principle of systematic doubt. And secondly,  because, Descartes explicitly affirms that it is deduced (deduit) from the  first principle of his philosophy, the one belonging to the cogitative exis- tence. Hence, “[t]he existence of God may be called a principle insofar as  it serves as a foundation for other arguments to follow in the work, but it  is not unqualifiedly a principle insofar as it requires a demonstration.”27 This epistemological subordination is synthetically captured by J.-M.  Nicolle. In his vision Descartes is a rationalist and his theory about God is largely based on  his philosophy. His God is the God of philosophers and scientists. His  theology is, in spite of his precautions, a theology which serves his theory  of knowledge. When we read his meditations, it is obvious that God is  only an argument in his philosophy.28 After all, even Cottingham, whom as we have seen decries the in-ex- istence of of God’s central role in numerous contemporary interpretations  of Cartesianism, recognizes that the image of God painted by Descartes is  a special one (and that it does not resemble the one we find in Pascal or  Kierkegaard): “God is central, but it is a God who is established by reason,  and who underpins the rationality of a system of science and morality that  offers genuine power to human beings to ameliorate their lives.”29 The most significant sign of this profound philosophical change is the  fact that the first and most direct truth of philosophy is / becomes self-con- sciousness. The first philosophical expression of a truth in the framework  of Cartesian metaphysics consists in recognizing the Cogito’s power of  27.

Moreover, the evidence of this first  truth becomes the model for all further truths, i.e. even for the cognitive  relation with the existence of God. It is the reason for which we could say  that this subordination of God is one directed towards self-consciousness  (or towards the Cogito), towards the human mind and its general activity.  It is remarkable, however, that this gesture of epistemological  reversal, of deriving God’s existence from my own (which, for the moderns,  also means a ‘mentalist’ / ‘intellectualist’ journey to God) can not only be  attributed to the legacy of Cartesianism or to a strictly rationalist depen- dence, because it represents a tendency of philosophical thinking in  general, and therefore of what could be called empirical frames or expres- sions. For example, differentiating between types of truth that are out of  reach to the human mind, Locke will assert the triple knowledge of exis- tence: “we have the knowledge of our own existence by intuition; of the  existence of God by demonstration; and of other things by sensation.”30 The decisive turning point here is – in our opinion – linked to how we  interpret the self-consciousness of the moderns. Of course, pre-modern  man was himself conscious about his own existence as a soul or as a soul  developing a somehow incessant activity. But he did not consider this fact  a truth, and even less the first fundamental truth. In fact, for him it is not  at all a truth – because we have to accept from the outset our finitude,  our integration in a vaster context (be it of nature / cosmos or the whole  Creation of God), our metaphysical finitude – it could not be accepted that  the finite “I” is a truth in itself, and even one that is self-asserting as such.  The truth of the self, if we can call it this way, is given only by the partici- pation of the soul to what is divine, owed to the divine in the human being,  the divine part of the soul.31 30. John LoCke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (The Pennsylvania State  University, 1999), 612. 31. See, for example, pLato, Alcibiade, 133c2-16, where Socrates talks about the region of  the soul (where knowing and understanding take place) that resembles the divine, “[s] o the way that we can best see and know ourselves is to use the finest mirror available  and look at God and, on the human level, at the virtue of the soul”, Complete Works, ed.

It is less important for us, in the context of our analysis, if this  passage is an authentic platonic one, or if it is the result of the interventions of certain  neo-Platonists. What is at stake is the fact that any self-knowledge is deprived of  directedness, it is mediated by the divine (which is understood in a moral sense in the  above quoted passage).

Hence, Pope John Paul II  captures in a synthetic manner exactly this transformation of God from  a living (concrete) presence, into a mental content, a rational possibility:  The Cogito ergo sum radically changed the way of doing philosophy.  In the pre-Cartesian period, philosophy, that is to say the Cogito (‘I am  thinking’) or rather Cognosco (‘I acquire knowledge’) was subordinate to  esse [being], which was considered primary. For Descartes, by contrast,  esse appeared secondary, while he viewed the Cogito as primary. This ...  marked the decisive abandonment of what philosophy had been hitherto,  particularly that of St. Thomas Aquinas ... [For Aquinas] God as fully  self-sufficient being (Ens subsistens) was considered as the indispensable  support for every ens non subsistens, for every ens participatum, that is  to say, for every created being, and hence for man. The Cogito ergo sum  carried within it a rupture with this line of thought. The ens cogitans  (thinking being) thus became primary. After Descartes, philosophy  became a science of pure thought: all that is being – the created world,  and even the Creator, is situated within the ambit of the Cogito, as  contents of human consciousness. Philosophy is concerned with beings  as contained in consciousness, and not as existing independently of it.32 But, if our analysis proves to be correct, we could identify more than  one way of subordinating God to the knowledge developed by the human  being for its own sake in the wake of modernity. In fact, beside what might  be called a direct epistemological subordination of God, testified mostly  by the aforementioned Cartesian reversal of the order between the truth  of the self and the truth of God, we find some other ways in which this  subordination is not so explicit or obvious – it only uses the framework  of a further interpretation or, at least, minimal inspection. We have called  them ways of an indirect subordination of God. 32. joHn pauL ii, Memory and Identity (London: Orion, 2005), 9, apud CottingHaM, “The  Role of God,” 291.

Evidence, certainty and the  mathematical as a norm of truth  The shaping of truth after the mathematical one, especially because  it concerns the essence of truth, brings with it many profound changes in  the metaphysical scheme of modernity. In this regard, the interpretation  offered by Heidegger is especially instructive.  It is no exaggeration if we consider, from his perspective, that  “Descartes’ metaphysics is the decisive beginning of the foundation of  metaphysics in the modern age. It was his task to ground the metaphysical  ground of man’s liberation in the new freedom of self-assured self-legisla- tion.”33 Mathematics is exactly the original, unique expression of this  auto-legislative power of modern man. Although innate in Descartes’  view – imprinted in the human intellect – these eternal or primal truths  are, in the same time, the concrete proof of man’s cognitive power to cover  them in their entirety which guarantees  their truth as such(= certainty),  without the need of God’s presence, other than in a formal manner.  But Heidegger does not see here a total break, but a fundamental  continuity.34 For him “[t]he history of modern mankind (...) was medi- ately prepared by Christian man, who was oriented toward the certitude  of salvation.”35 Alongside Descartes, Heidegger highlights that modern man’s freedom  (which must be understood as a liberation) presupposes that “in place of  the certitude of salvation, which was the standard for all truth, man posits  the kind of certitude by virtue of which and in which he becomes certain  of himself as the being that thus founds itself on itself.”36 Or, otherwise  put, “[l]iberation from the revealed certitude of the salvation of individual  immortal souls is in itself liberation to a certitude in which man can by  himself be sure of his own definition and task.”37  33. Martin Heidegger, Nietzsche, Vol. IV, trans. Joan Stambaugh et al. (San Francisco:  Harper, 1991), 100; GA 6.2 129. 34. After all predictable, if we take into consideration that we face an author who thought  of the whole history of Western metaphysics as the expression of a unique process  of the forgetting of being, a unitary paradigm which affirms the historical synthesis  between ontology and theology (onto-theology). 35.

The certitude of the mathematical truth takes  the place (in the sense that it occupies the function) of the certitude of the  revealed truth. Which means that, prior to modernity, mathematics wasn’t  thought of (or, at least, not in a decisive manner) from the perspective of  the category of certitude – but from stances like perfection, beauty, immu- tability etc. In a way, it could be said that pre-modern mathematics was  certain without offering certainty. Certainty is not just a simple quality  of mathematical reasonings, but, especially, an existential-ontological  category (more than a simple epistemological one). Otherwise put, it is  about the securing of existence within the modern frameworks of reality.  Hence, the subordination given by the manifestation of mathe- matical truth, its understanding as a ‘standard of truth’, as in Spinoza’s  case,38 does not represent solely a cognitive change. Moreover, for Spinoza  it comes to understanding mathematics as giving an entirely different rule  to the truth, uncontaminated by the teleology that had affected other types  of knowledge, including theology, or God’s thinking in general. Heidegger  is therefore right to talk about a move from the certainty of salvation to  the “secularized” certainty of mathematics. But it must be stressed: this  concerns the passage from a certainty offered by God (the existence of tran- scendence), to one established through its self-evidence (thus immanent).  It is this transition that certifies the appearance of the modern subject. We might add that Cartesian Platonism is a sui generis one that tries  to capture an inverse endeavor. The transcendence of the mathematical  object occurs after the internal (immanent) epistemological inspection  conducted by a mind which establishes truth. In short, transcendence  “corresponds” to mathematics and not vice versa. We believe that  Cartesian innatism is only a way to reconcile a constructivist epistemo- logical mentalism with the requirement of ontological independence of  the mathematical object (still being felt as a needed one).39 38.

A (unfortunately) short parenthesis for an important issue: it is a difficult problem to  justly appreciate the Platonic character of the mathematics of modern rationalism  or, even better, of whatever might be Platonic within it. Only briefly put, we should  differentiate, in my opinion, between a Platonism of mathematical objects, which  leads desCartes, for example, to his doctrine of innate ideas (the example of chiliagon  is very instructive here), and the way in which mathematics is intended – by means  of mathematical equations  – to express the mechanical character of the universe,  Vol. 73 Vol. 73 Fasc. 2 RPF 2017 Fasc. 2 RPF 2017 Provided for Personal License use.

And whether  we understand this endeavor in the horizon of intuition or in that of  deduction, joining these two truths “works” very well. However, the two  cognitive mechanisms mentioned are themselves taken from the pursuit  of mathematical knowledge and afterwards generalized for all knowl- edge,40 regardless of its subject – i.e. for God too. Hence, maybe the most known passage in which we find this  connection is found in Descartes’ formulation of the ontological argu- ment.41 With this occasion, he mentions that  when I looked (...) at the idea I had of a perfect being, I found that this  included existence in the same way as – or even more evidently than –  the idea of a triangle includes the equality of its three angles to two right  angles, or the idea of a sphere includes the equidistance of all the points  on the surface from the centre. Thus I concluded that it is at least as  certain as any geometrical proof that God, who is this perfect being, is  or exists.42  This process may seem today a perfectly legitimate one, even if  invalid (if we are to follow a Kantian line of argumentation). Ultimately,  both concepts  – as logical and linguistic entities  – can be put together  and analyzed with ease through the same process of the knowing subject.  This transpires clearly from the Replies that Descartes gives to Gassendi’s  Objections, where he states that “[t]o list existence among the properties  which belong to the nature of God is no more ‘begging the question’ than  listing among the properties of a triangle the fact that its angles are equal  to two right angles.”43 In Descartes’s view we are confronted with a fundamental possibility  of the human mind, justified since the first lines of his Rules, through the  claim that in all disciplines of knowledge one has to do with the exercise of  its concrete and regular functioning. Moreover, the Platonism of mathematics is not  ontological, but epistemological. Numbers, geometrical figures, are neither ontological  models per se for the rest of reality, nor steps for apprehending superior metaphysical  realities or essences. The question here has to do with the certainty of the properties (i.e.  a model of functional truth) that could be deduced from (or in) them, one that exceeds  entirely the possibility of emerging through the uses (exercises) of the senses. 40. See the Cartesian endeavor from Rules for the Direction of the Mind, especially Rule III. 41. But, as we will see, not only here. 42. AT VI 36, CSM I 129. 43. AT VII 383, CSM II 263.

This is the reason why Descartes will respond to Gassendi, discon- certed by the possibility of the concerned link, that  you are quite mistaken when you say that the demonstration of God’s  existence is not like the demonstration that the three angles of a triangle  are equal to two right angles. The reasoning is the same in both cases,  except that the demonstration which establishes God’s existence is much  simpler and clearer than the corresponding demonstration about the  triangle.45 I would just like to stress that this alethic approach could be read  in two distinct ways, both particularly significant for our discussion: 1)  as the founding possibility (opening) of our minds which enable them to  put together in a pure and simple manner the two truths side by side,  i.e. to perceive their common cognitive significance, their epistemological  continuity (which also means the homogeneity of the cognitive domain in  general, announced in Rule I); and this is a “psychological” perspective, but  about what gives birth to a decisive metaphysical reading for the destiny  of humanity, in a Heideggerian sense; 2) as the ability to establish and  further provide (translate) a formal mechanism to guarantee the assertion  / demonstration of the existence of God. Regarding the first point, in Descartes’ case we can identify countless  other pairings between mathematical truths (ideas) and God. Nicolle’s  observation according to which, during the fourth set of Answers to  Objections, “Descartes maintains the constant Analogy Between theo- logical Truths and mathematical Truths”46 must be extended to the whole  Cartesian oeuvre. Maybe the most significant paragraph in this sense is the one from  Meditations, where Descartes noted that [c]ertainly, the idea of God, or a supremely perfect being, is one which I  find within me just as surely as the idea of any shape or number. And my  understanding that it belongs to his nature that he always exists is no less  44. niCoLLe, “The Mathematical Analogy,” 400. 45.

Hence, even  if it turned out that not everything on which I have meditated in these  past days is true, I ought still to regard the existence of God as having at  least the same level of certainty as I have hitherto attributed to the truths  of mathematics.47  In fact, The Fifth Meditation in its entirety is full of examples and  analogies between God and mathematical entities (form, number, triangle,  right triangle etc.).  It is worth highlighting that, in addition, mathematical truth (its  “behavior”) becomes an epistemological model for us in modernity, and  thus also for our cognitive approach of God,48 independently of the epis- temological status of mathematical ideas, be they innate, as in Descartes’  case, or acquired, as Locke thought49 – otherwise put, whether we approach  this issue from a realist or nominalist stance. I would not like to enter a detailed discussion concerning the second  point, the one that could be identified with the formal issue of the onto- logical argument. What is of interest here is not necessarily the validity  of this reasoning, but the possibility itself of transferring a mathematical  procedure in onto-theology. But, of course, there are numerous such  analysis, like the very detailed one belonging to Dougherty50 who, starting  47. AT VII 65-66; CSM II 45. 48. Of course, in a completely different framework of thinking than the ontological one  offered in Antiquity for mathematical entities, like the one in Plato’s Republic.  49. For Locke “that the three angles of a triangle are quite equal to two right ones is a  truth as certain as anything can be, and I think more evident than many of those  propositions that go for principles; and yet there are millions, however expert in other  things, who know not this at all, because they never set their thoughts on work about  such angles” (Essay, 82). It must be remarked that also in this context of the critique  of Cartesian innetism there is a passage from the certainty of mathematical truth  (non-evident through itself) to that of the existence of God: “And he that certainly  knows this proposition may yet be utterly ignorant of the truth of other propositions,  in mathematics itself, which are as clear and evident as this; because, in his search  of those mathematical truths, he stopped his thoughts short and went not so far. The  same may happen concerning the notions we have of the being of a Deity. For, though  there be no truth which a man may more evidently make out to himself than the  existence of a God, yet he that shall content himself with things as he finds them in  this world, as they minister to his pleasures and passions, and not make inquiry a little  further into their causes, ends, and admirable contrivances, and pursue the thoughts  thereof with diligence and attention, may live long without any notion of such a Being”  (Ibid., 82-83). 50.  “The Importance of Cartesian Triangles.” Vol. 73 Vol. 73 Fasc. 2 RPF 2017 Fasc. 2 RPF 2017 Provided for Personal License use.

There are many resemblances and differ- ences that must be questioned when addressing the “technical” possibility  of transferring the mechanism of the relation between essence and its  properties in mathematics to God and its existence in philosophy.  We believe, alongside Nicolle, that this benchmark is the necessary  connection obvious in both cases: “the main similarity between these two  ideas is the necessity of the link between the essence and its properties.  (...) Necessity: this is the real link which is the basis, beyond the apparent  difference, of the analogy between God and a triangle.”51 The same author states, in regard to the “benefits and losses” that we  feel when such a transfer of procedures of argumentation takes place:  The mathematical analogy in the proof of God’s existence is at the same  time strong and feeble. It is strong because it shows very well that the way  to truth is the same for divine truths and for mathematical truths. (...)  On the other hand, the analogy is feeble because it ignores an essential  difference between metaphysics which deals with the question of exis- tence and mathematics which rules out this question.52 Descartes’s rationalistic example is not an isolated one, the mech- anism of extreme analogy / rapprochement, in its formal-deductive aspect  between the two types of alethic determinations is also to be found in an  empiricist context in Locke. For this latter, We are capable of knowing certainly that there is a God. Though  God has given us no innate ideas of himself (...) But, though this be the  most obvious truth that reason discovers, and though its evidence be (if I  mistake not) equal to mathematical certainty: yet it requires thought and  attention; and the mind must apply itself to a regular deduction of it from  some part of our intuitive knowledge, or else we shall be as uncertain  and ignorant of this as of other propositions, which are in themselves  capable of clear demonstration. To show, therefore, that we are capable  of knowing, i.e. being certain that there is a God, and how we may come  by this certainty, I think we need go no further than ourselves, and that  undoubted knowledge we have of our own existence.53 51. niCoLLe, “The Mathematical Analogy,” 401. 52.

The indirect subordination of God through the imposition of an  a priori method of researching truth of mathematical origin  We are also dealing here with a well-known aspect – and again, the  Cartesian model is exemplary in this respect. For Descartes, the concerned  method is analytical, of a mathematical inspiration – i.e. inspired by the  only sciences that offer absolutely certain truths. Both theology, and  metaphysics are left behind in the process of selection of a method,54 only  mathematics is the one which offers the concrete proof of the fact that it  already possesses in itself this absolute certain method that I can use in  order to advance in knowledge.  Or, this method pre-exists the manifestation of God, it “guides” him  in its path towards us; moreover, it is a negative method, a method of  doubt (from which it will appear that the first and most manifest truth  is the one of the presentation of the self to itself in its pure cogitative  activity), which throws into a shadow the positivity of the divine presence.  Let us not also talk about the sui generis, formal, equivalence (omnipotent  God – evil demon) at the end of the first meditation, meant only to evoke  some possible objections regarding the possibility inherent in transcen- dence of fooling us with regard to everything we know. In a certain sense,  this method is meant to offer human being the possibility to start, by itself,  an absolutely certain cognitive move in a setting where neither God, nor  any other type of truth (apart from the primary truth of the method / the  subject) is present. The Cartesian subject is, initially, a lonely, isolated one,  and the method – instituted by itself – represents exactly that instrument  that allows it to institute itself. The only reality on which it could count  will appear as a result of applying this method.  We can also add here that for Spinoza the axiomatic method plays  the same role of intellectual / cognitive constraints, from a formal point  of view, and in spite of the difference between his synthetic method and  the Cartesian one. An important aspect in this case is played by the fact  that the axiomatic explanation somehow reproduces the manifestation,  “the unfolding” of God. For Windelband, the axiomatic method has the  54. But for different reasons. Metaphysics offers the image of a perpetual war theater, with  its changeable, uncertain, truths, while theology does not open at all the horizons of  knowledge, and hence of scientific certainty, since, in what concerns the heavens, the  road that leads there “is open no less to the most ignorant than to the most learned,  and the revealed truths which guide us there are beyond our understanding” (AT VI 8;  CSM I 114).

But  we should not restrict the meaning of what was said only to the so-called  strict epistemological issues, because there is also a deeper significance,  given in this case by the analysis of the relation of the human being with  reality in general and God in particular56.  The possibility of using the Cartesian method and, consequently,  structured rationalism through the implementation of the former is open  not only to the philosophy of rationalistic inspiration, but also to theology  or religious practice. Thus, in Max Weber’s view, it is not a coincidence  that the last great revival of Puritanism in the eighteenth century bears the  name of “Methodism”, making a reference to the attempt of its members  55. Wilhelm windeLBand, A History of Philosophy, with Especial Reference to the Formation  and Development of Its Problems and Conceptions, sec. ed., trans. James H. Tufts (New  York: The Macmillan Company, 1901), 396. An important difference should (at least)  be noted, however, between the Cartesian and Spinozean method; if in the case of  the former we stress its negativity, for the second we remark precisely its positivity,  as highlighted by Wildenband. In other words, it is about the positivity of the divine  presence, subordinate to the “operation” of the mathematical method involved. 56. This does not entail, of course, the acceptance of such an epistemological strategy  by all the modern thinkers. Moreover, even some of those considered close to this  philosophical framework, which in this case is rationalism, do not accept this  development. Leibniz, for example, will amend exactly this possibility of a Cartesian  inspiration of extending beyond its area of application and in an automated fashion  a method valid only in mathematics (see the passage „La vraie Methode”). Which  does not mean that he will not make appeal to such strategies – some influenced by  mathematics! – through which he aims to contribute to the consolidation of the process  of the epistemological subordination of God. Ultimately, the same fragment offers the  solution for the construal of a universal language and calculus, of a mathematical  inspiration, which would allow the acquisition of the truth of science in all disciplines  which use the deductive reasoning starting from experience (ex datis). See also  Lachterman’s observation in footnote 59. This footnote is, in its first part, the result of  one of the reviewer’s very relevant observations.

The reference to Descartes is obvious,  especially since the implementation of this method involves a constant  reflexivity of the human subject. In other words, “Descartes’ «cogito ergo  sum» was taken over by contemporary Puritans in this ethical reinterpre- tation.”57 6. The indirect subordination of God through the fundamentally  constructive character of mathematics (through mathematic  constructivism)  One of the most important points of our present argumentation  concerns the specific significance (which presupposes in itself numerous  fruitful semantic openings) of what could be called the constructive char- acter of mathematics in modernity (or its constructivism) – an element  which marks a radical change in the understanding and practice of mathe- matics and also (in tight connection with the previous statement) a change  in the profoundness of the relation between human beings and God or  reality, understood in a general manner.58 In what follows we will follow some ideas and conclusions espoused  by David R. Lachterman in his important work The Ethics of Geometry,  subtitled A Genealogy of Modernity, although we will not limit ourselves to  57. Max weBer, The Protestant Ethic and the “Spirit” of Capitalism and Other Writings,  trans. Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells (New York, etc.: Penguin Books, 2002), 80sq.  But, some authors believe that Descartes’ presence in Weber’s text is “somewhat  unlikely”, Peter gHosH, Max Weber and The Protestant Ethic: Twin Histories (New  York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 106. One of the problems which Weber’s analysis  confronts is that he invokes desCartes, and his opponent Voet (Voetius) in the attempt  of maintaining a modernized protestant ascetism, which rationalizes, Peter gHosH, A  Historian Reads Max Weber: Essays on the Protestant Ethic (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz  Verlag, 2008), 58, n. 22. 58. As we have already mentioned, our interpretation does not exclude the possibility  of identifying thinkers who intuited one way or another some ideas of the moderns  concerning this subject. Thus, we could enumerate, just as an example, Proclus (for  which the soul, in the case of mathematics, oscillates between the intellect and the  sensible, being a “generatrix of mathematical forms and ideas” and characterized  through „life-giving activity) or Cusanus (where we encounter an activity of the intellect  that produces the line, the surface).

If we are to synthesize the general conception of the same author,  we could make the following affirmations: 1) constructivism is one of  the fundamental traits of modernity; 2) mathematical (constructivism)  covers the whole (early) modern philosophy, from Descartes to Kant;59 3)  constructivism is not and should not only be linked with epistemology or  (philosophy) of mathematics, but also with a manner of thinking (or relate  to reality) in general.60 If we are to constrain ourselves only to what happens within the  frameworks of mathematical activity, then we could identify, following  the same author, two important modifications. Thus, in modernity, 1)  “mathematics is essentially occupied with the solution of problems, not  with the proof of theorems”; 2) “mathematics is most fertilely pursued  as the «construction of problems or equations» – that is, as the transpo- sition of mathematical intelligibility and certainty from the algebraic to  the geometrical domain, or from the interior forum of the mind to the  external forum of space and body.”61 It is interesting to note that also for  Lachterman, the trigger for this ample historical process is Descartes, the  two prior statements finding their source “at the deepest stratum of the  «Cartesian» soul.”62  Technically speaking, all this process is about the passage from a  mathematical model based on theorem-proving to one concerning prob- lem-solving,63 accompanied by the wish “to move from conceptual  59. “A fairly direct line runs (...) from the «construction of a problem» (Descartes), through  the «construction of an equation» (Leibniz), to Kant’s «construction of a concept»”,  David Rapport LaCHterMan, The Ethics of Geometry: A Genealogy of Modernity (New  York and London: Routledge, 1989), vii. 60. “Kant’s «revolution in [our] style of thinking» showed up (...) as an attempt to expend  the entire capital of this constructivist legacy within every philosophical domain  he sought to occupy or to transform, including epistemology, the theory of natural  science, ethics, and his oblique, truncated, but nonetheless seminal philosophy of  history”, Ibid. 61. Ibid., viii. 62. Ibid. 63. In another context, Ortega y Gasset observed that modern science does not aim to  (“directly”) know things / reality, but will convert them into issues (questions); the role  of science is to solve problems defined as scientific. In addition, there are no absolute  problems for modern deductive theory, but only issues relative to specific preliminary  data (freely “selected” by the knowing subject in order to configure a matter of  knowledge). This also means that scientific issues – the proper “object” of knowledge –  are special: they are open, can be modified, changed, abandoned etc. See José ortega  y gasset, L’Évolution de la théorie déductive.

For Lachterman what we discover here is not a matter of reference or meaning; rather, the difference concerns  the source of the intelligibility of the figure (or statement) at issue: in the  one, the ancient case, this source is the nature of the figure in its own  right, while in the other, modern, case, it is to be found in the strategies  and tactics certain to bring the figure into visible or “bodily” being. A  distinction in the manner of knowing entails a difference in the mode of  being.64  Instead of the subject conforming to a truth, we have a truth (and  a “reality”) that is instituted through its activity. This truth must be  produced, fabricated, it is man’s duty to do it. We must not be surprised,  consequentially, that this change has profound effects, ethical effects as  Lachterman maintains,65 which concern the behavior of the human being  in the world and towards the world.  From this perspective, we identify not only the highlighting of a funda- mental activism of the (non-contemplative) human being, that we ourselves  stressed earlier, but also the essence of the endeavor of conquering nature  as some of the profound consequences of mathematical constructivism in  early modernity. We do not treat here the strictly concrete aspect of taking  into possession, but the more subtle one that concerns the elimination of  a fundamental otherness understood as Nature (by building this otherness  starting from itself, or better said by designating this self starting from  the impositions of a subjectivity avid of certitude and exactitude), of initi- ation – we might add – into a process that continues up until our days  through the abolition of transcendence. In Lachterman’s words,  [t]he constructivist project, rooted in Descartes’ geometry and exfoliated  in Kant’s critical enterprise, took its bearings from the desire to master  and possess nature, where nature was understood as the locus of appar- ently ineliminable or intractable otherness. Mind could aspire to master  its other (in the form of extension, or the manifold of given sensations)  by externalizing itself in a construction carrying the clear marks of its  inward and deliberate origin.66 64.

The mind is not nature’s mirror; it is  nature’s generative or creative source. (my italics)67 In other words, the very capacity of the human mind of producing  (constructing) truth through itself, of not just thinking an ‘imposed’ truth  as a transcendence, is affirmed through the way in which moderns under- stand mathematics. The movement of mathematical construction inaugu- rates through the ‘meaning’ of truth, in spite of a contemplation that tried  to capture exactly what it lacks: immutability, eternity, purity of a form, all  of them attributes belonging to the divine.  From Descartes to Kant (we only stop at these references), we  find such well defined projects, through which mathematics will firmly  maintain a new type of relating of the human being to reality and God.  Maybe one of the most suggestive passages in this sense can be found in  Salomon Maimon, a contemporary of Kant’s maturity period. For him,  “[a]ll of the concepts of mathematics are thought by us and at the same  time exhibited as real objects [als reelle Objekte] through construction a  priori. We are, in this respect, similar to God. (my italics)”68 But the concerned similarity might seem a little too less. As a short  adagio to this subject that has echoes up until our days, we should take  notice of the fact that there is one more step to make – the total, program- matic elimination of any transcendence from the activity of the mathema- tician (a self-censuring with the ultimate aim of total auto-referentiality)  and this will be realized in the XXth century by mathematical construc- tivism.69 To put it shortly, this means leaving mathematics to man and only  to him. Errett Bishop stressed that: 1) classical mathematics presupposes  operations that could be developed (only) by God;70 2) we should reject  67. Ibid., ix 68. Quoted in LaCHterMan, The Ethics of Geometry, 18. 69. Critics including intuitionist mathematicians (in particular Brouwer) whom are anti- realistic (anti-platonists) are representatives of this school. In their view, math was not  totally purged of those items that can not be subject to a strict constructivist procedure. 70.

In his own words,  [m]athematics belongs to man, not to God. We are not interested in prop- erties of the positive integers that have no descriptive meaning for finite  man. When a man proves a positive integer to exist, he should show how  to find it. If God has mathematics of his own that needs to be done, let  him do it himself (my italics).71 7. Conclusion The following idea, which I will only sketchily develop here, is still  worth stressing; it concerns the fact that there is a decisive correspondence  (both from an epistemological and ontological point of view) between  the dynamism of the intellect expressed through mathematical construc- tivism and the centrality of the category of movement in the bigger picture  of reality.  First and foremost, we can remark, in a much more restrained  context, a correspondence between the manner in which mathematical  constructivism is thought of and the one in which visible movements in  the physical realm are conceived. As Domski showed, by making appeal to  the Cartesian approach of movement in nature in Le monde, [t]he visible motions of his new world are thereby modeled on the  continuous motions used by geometers to generate clearly conceivable  curves; and thus, we see Descartes integrating his approach to geometry,  and his geometrical standard of intelligibility in particular, with his early  mechanical account of nature.72 Of course, what we could call the standard reading concerning this issue,  sees in God the source of the reason for the existence of this situation. The  same Domski mentions that  71. Errett BisHop, Foundations of Constructive Analysis (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967),  2.

Put differently, God  creates motion in the simplest possible way, where simplicity is deter- mined by appeal to that which is clearest and most distinct to the human  intellect  – the very same standard embraced in the geometrical works  written around the same time.73 But, in an opposite manner, which takes into consideration that  the attributes of clarity and difference could become (and they indeed  become!) the expression of a self-sufficient, wholly immanent, intellectual  power, we could read this state of affairs as a collapse of the expression  of divinity within the frameworks of nature – by way of mathematics –  through what is ‘allowed’ to the human intellect, through the instituted  constraints.  Secondly, this correspondence could be extended to a specific  cognitive behavior which is observed within the frameworks of a new  constructive manner of understanding mathematics by moderns and an  universalization of the category of movement, from an epistemological  and ontological point of view, which determines a profound movement of  the way in which God is incorporated into reality, with the latent supple- mentary effect of his subordination.  We are also dealing here with a correspondence between the inherent  activism of the human subject (in a cognitive sense, but with decisive  effects towards the physical and social reality) and the immanent-con- structive endeavor through which the internal necessity of the object to be  known is determined. Cassirer, when talking about Galileo in his Dialogue  Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, stressed that we are dealing here  with a new synthesis within the world of mind, and together with it a new  correlation of “subject” and “object”. Reflection on human freedom, on  man’s original, creative force, requires as its complement and its confir- mation the concept of the immanent “necessity” of the natural object.74 Moreover, if we are allowed an over-simplification, the same process  is about understanding the ‘object’ of physical analysis not in the horizon  of the determination of individual substance (of the thing), but in the  73.

The centrality of movement is not the only thing to be considered.  The unification / homogenization of physical reality, which institutes  the sublunary / superlunary Aristotelian division corresponding to two  different ontological realms is another issue. To put it shortly, movement  thus understood appears as a unifying explicative factor of phenomenal  diversity. This also means an ‘indifference’ towards individual substance  (towards the in-itself of things) and a focus on processes, movements – in  other words, on the relations between them. And this endeavor will be  realized by way of mathematics. Thus, within the frameworks of a new  mathematical physics,  [t]he task has been to attempt to unite what superficially appears to be  separate. It was not the things in themselves which were sorted out and  compared, but their motions and behaviours. Mathematics furnished the  tools. Newton succeeded in describing the commonalities in the fall of  an apple, the motions of the moon and the planets, the tides, and much  more.75 God is not totally eliminated from this picture of physical reality,  he is still present in the form of immutable laws that regulate various  processes. God is not (exactly) equivalent with moving matter (with  continually moving it, with sustaining, in a way, its movement, with even  its existence – as movement / moved). God is not at all eliminated from the  (concrete) phenomenal register, its presence is palpable, even necessary,  through movement. But this movement (given by or through God) can be  judged by way of mathematical equations (relations), and, hence, precisely  through the human intellect. It is a God (in or as movement...) transparent  for the human being. Given for its evidence. From this perspective, math- 75.

The same authors observe that:  a) on the one side, in the medieval period, the concept of movement has suffered an  accentuated impoverishment, being reduced to two types of movement corresponding  to two ontological domains; the concepts of change, modification, transgression,  perishability etc., as they were mentioned by Aristotle, were left behind (Ibid., 315);  b) on the other hand, we are dealing with a program that is only now triggered by its  fundamental traits – „[ot]hers took up where he left off. Örsted connected magnetism  and electricity. Then Maxwell introduced light into the same conceptual apparatus.  And so it has continued inward towards the microcosm and outwards towards the  macrocosm.” (Ibid., 317). Ultimately, today’s science is about the continuation of the  same type of endeavor.

God is confounded with the total transparency of its presence  in the phenomenal, a presence without mystery, miracles or wonders.  *** Ultimately, this constructivism characteristic to mathematics is found  in numerous – and only apparently disparate – realms of human thought  and action in modernity. For Lachterman, the idea of a ‘constructive’  human being, of a ‘productive’ mind, allows us  to make coherent sense of a wide range of phenomena, all of which we  have good reason to associate with modernity even when they stand at  considerable distances from one another – phenomena such as individu- alism and the mechanical organization of the «state,» a belief in human  perfectibility and in the ineluctable need or desire for self-preservation,  the inwardness of selfhood and the program of conquering external  “Nature”.76 It is self-evident that all these elements have a potential of profoundly  changing the connections between human beings and divinity.  As a very concise conclusion of our whole contribution, we want to  stress that mathematics is not,stricto sensu, the unique source77 of this  modification, both in the ontology of the human and in that of nature  (in all its various modalities quoted above), but besides other endeavors,  mathematics comes with a decisive contribution, as it can be seen as a  model for the cognitive success within the new configuration, belonging  not only to science in a restricted sense, but also to spirituality in general.  76. LaCHterMan, The Ethics of Geometry, 4-5. 77. Here we part LaCHterMan, for whom the constructivism characteristic to modern  mathematics is indeed the source of all other fundamental aspects of modernity.  For him “«construction» in the strict and technical sense in which it issued in late  sixteenth – and seventeenth-century mathematics (...) stands patently at the center of  the modern constellation in this inaugural, self-formative period.” (Ibid., 5).
