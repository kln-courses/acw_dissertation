<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL G. MORRISON TWO KINDS OF THEORY IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES INTRODUCTION In one sense, not every science of social phenomena qualifies as a social science, but only one which investigates the structure of one or more entire societies or cultures. It is within this context, perhaps, that historical linguistics, despite its central concern with an important variety of socially transmitted behavior and its largely deductive character, is less often classified with the social sciences than with the humanities. From a broader standpoint, however, one may construe as a social science any science which investigates a complex of human behavior, attitude and belief that is transmitted, maintained, modified or discon- tinued through interpersonal influence. If the social sciences are under- stood in this broad sense, it is possible to distinguish two kinds of theory at work in them. On one hand, we may discern theories of social phenome- na which function in deductive-nomothetic explanation. Atypical example is the theory of the evolution of the Indo-European languages. On the other hand, we also come across passages in the works of leading social scientists which combine apparently untestable theories about whole societies, cultures or institutions with methodological prescriptions for investigating them. Examples from social anthropology are Radcliffe- Brown's early functionalism and the organismic theory of Ruth Benedict. Following a brief account and a preliminary critique of the theories cited, I shall argue that theories of the second sort are not adequately inter- preted as bad theories of the first sort, but are better viewed as serving a persistent noncognitive function in fostering indirectly the pursuit of deductive-nomothetic reasoning about social phenomena. 1. A THEORY OF LINGUISTIC EVOLUTION Starting from perceived similarities in word form and grammatical com- position from one observed language to another, the 'Young Grammari- Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, VIII.

They did so by postulating sets of laws which account for pervasive sound shifts distinguishing the word forms of a parent language from those of a tongue immediately derived from it. Since the word forms of the ancestral languages had to be reconstructed right down to their inflections, their postulation together with the sound laws linking them to one another and to the recorded languages comprise a vast testable theoretic edifice. One way of testing this structure involves projecting the form of an expression in one recorded member language from its cognate in another by recourse to appropriate sound laws from the theoretical superstructure, and then trying to confirm the projection - for example, by looking for the deduced form in a dictionary of the target language. In this way, starting from the East Germanic or Gothic expression '-faths', meaning 'master', one might seek to project its Greek cognate as follows. Applying sound laws which postulate that an initial 'f' in a Germanic language derives from an initial 'p' in the hypothetical Indo-European parent language; that a short 'a' in Germanic roots of the kind in question comes from a short 'o' in Indo-European; and that Germanic regularly dropped unaccented 'e' before final 's' in nominative singular forms, we reconstruct the parent form of the Gothic word '-faths' as the Indo-European word '-potes'. And since the sound laws connecting the reconstructed parent language with Greek call for no changes in that particular form, we next seek confirmation by looking for a cognate Greek word, having to do with dominion, and containing the form '-potes'. And success is at hand when we hit upon the Greek compound from which our own word 'despot' is borrowed. Now each such projection qualifies as an empirical inference in Israel Scheffler's sense, since temporally it involves what he has called forward and backward nomic regularities.' The uncanny frequency with which such projections can be made shows historical linguistics to be a deductive-nomothetic science of social phenomena. 2. ANTHROPOLOGICAL THEORIES OF SOCIETY AND CULTURE The functionalist view expressed in Radcliffe-Browns' book The Andaman Islanders contrasts sharply with deductive-nomothetic theories. For</page><page sequence="3">TWO KINDS OF THEORY IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 567 although he seeks empirical laws, he holds that hypothetical reconstruc- tions of prehistoric cultural practices are not verifiable.2 The trouble with this is that law-like generalizations in any field refer indifferently to historic and prehistoric events alike. What would become of geology, paleon- tology or astrophysics, for example, if Radcliffe-Brown's methodological dictum were applied to them? In disciplines in which prehistoric recon- structions are routinely rejected, is not the process of law-like generaliza- tion ruled out as well? Radcliffe-Brown's careful study of the Andamanese surely points up the value of functional studies of stable systems of concurrent practices. On the other hand, much can also be said for studies of major cultural change. The history of the Fiji Islanders provides a case in point. A recent visitor to the Fijis reports that its people are friendly, mild-mannered and happy, in contrast to their anxiety-ridden forebears a hundred years ago, who were "known ... as the most blood-thirsty, flesh-craving cannibals in the world." 3 In those days, a Fijian was apprehensive about going outside of his village alone, for fear of being clubbed and eaten by other Fijians at a feast in some neighboring village. While a functional anthropologist of Radcliffe-Brown's persuasion might prefer to investigate whatever culture was extant in those islands at the time of his study, a devotee of an organismic theory of culture like Ruth Benedict's might prefer to deal with the whole period in which the drastic changes occurred. For on an account like hers, one might hold that the pattern of Fiji culture was discarding cannibalism, and modifying its other practices to support civic, religious and ethical attitudes imported from the West which militate against feasting on human flesh.4 From the foregoing, it is evident that there are at least two ways in which one might be tempted to employ the term 'culture' in describing the Fiji experience. One might, in Ruth Benedict's tradition, construe the whole historical spread of changing practices in the Islands as the Fiji culture. Or again, in Radcliffe-Browns' functionalist way, one might want to take some maximum structure of concurrent institutions, customs and beliefs as the Fiji culture of the nineteenth century, or as the Fiji culture of the twentieth century - denying that there is anything spanning both centuries which could properly be called the Fiji culture. Another feature of the social theories just considered which, like Rad- cliffe-Brown's injunction against hypothetical reconstructions, would be</page><page sequence="4">568 PAUL G. MORRISON suspect in the natural sciences, is their anthropomorphism. For Radcliffe- Brown, societies and the ceremonials which keep them in force have needs of their own.5 For Benedict, the purpose of a culture selects, recasts, or discards various traits. Moreover, that purpose makes demands with which the traits that it uses must conform.6 In defense of Ruth Benedict, one might observe that she immediately disavows that any conscious choice or purpose is actually involved in cultural change. It is only that "when we describe the process historically, we inevitably use animistic forms of expression" - as though choice and purpose were involved.7 On her account, our language initially forces us to claim something that we do not literally mean. Luckily, though, we are subsequently able to make amends for this linguistic compulsion by denying voluntary attributes to a culture pattern. Hers, then, is only a retractile anthropomorphism. Maurice Mandelbaum makes a similar defense of Radcliffe-Brown's position, denying that the latter meant to speak of a "selective power in the society ... which accepts or rejects specific beliefs and customs ... "8 Even if the anthropomorphic overtones of the two theories are not to be taken seriously, however, it is still not clear that either author has a definite concept of what a society or culture is. Of course, those familar with these theories may object that the holistic emphasis of each shows that a definite notion of society or culture is employed in it. For Benedict's insistence that a culture is more than the sum of its traits (since it embodies them in a unique arrangement)9 suggests that she had in mind a criterion for identifying a culture. Moreover, to recommend, as Radcliffe-Brown does, that we investigate the relation between a whole system of ritual and myth and the entire culture within which it operates10 is, in part, to suggest that we must know how to identify any such whole system and any such entire culture. The big difficulty, however, is that neither theory reveals how we are to tell when a cultural pattern is finally broken. What is it about these concepts of society or culture which lets us know when the historical complexies to which they refer have come to an end? It is much easier to tell when the social transmission of the Gothic language ceased between native speakers than to tell when the social system of Ancient Greece expired. Radcliffe-Brown was aware of the problem. For in his essay 'Patrilineal</page><page sequence="5">TWO KINDS OF THEORY IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 569 and Matrilineal Succession', he declared that any social system, "to sur- vive, must conform to certain conditions. If we can define adequately one of these universal conditions ... we have a sociological law. Thereupon if it can be shown that a particular institution in a particular society is the means by which that society conforms to the law ... we may speak of this as the 'sociological origin' of the institution."1 The trouble with this position is that we would need to identify all of the institutions essential to the survival of a society, rather than just one or several, in order to know when or under what conditions a particular cociety would become defunct. And the situation is complicated by the fact that two or more competitive institutions for accomplishing the same end are often present in the same populated locality. In Istanbul under the Ottomans, for example, monogamy and polygamy coexisted. But surely these are competitive institutions satisfying the same general needs. How, in such cases, may we determine which of several concurrent alter- native institutions with the same general function is 'the' means by which a society conforms to a sociological law? If there can be only one such institutional means, must its competitors not be considered deviant institutions? From these considerations, it appears that Radcliffe-Brown's criterion for selecting the essential components of a social system is at best a sub- jective one for backing a personal preference for one competitive institu- tion over its rivals. But this leaves room for an indissoluble disagreement as to which of several largely overlapping institutional complexes comprise the actual social system in a particular locale, since investigators of social phenomena have no special immunity to the random conditioning which brings about virtually ineradicable differences in personal prefer- ence. The same difficulty crops up in Ruth Benedict's theory, according to which a culture selects, modifies or discards social practices. How, for example, would her theory apply to the revolution in the eating habits of the Fiji Islanders? During the transition period, while the eating of human flesh and the Western eating customs which later displaced them were both in vogue, was the culture continuing while discarding cannibalism? Or was it perhaps expiring because cannibalism was dying out? Or had that culture ever selected eating practices of any kind as essential parts of its structure? Benedict's theory provides no means of gauging whether</page><page sequence="6">570 PAUL G. MORRISON the discontinuance of a practice spells the involuntary death of a culture, or merely shows the culture to be flourishing while discarding that prac- tice. It is noncommittal as to which of several rival kinds of traits or successions of traits are essential features of their cultures and which are only accidental to them. It would appear, then, that neither Radcliffe-Brown nor Ruth Benedict had a determinate concept of a social system or culture after all. Although each of these authors thought of his field as an empirical science, and although each may have thought that he was developing an empirical concept of society or culture, neither of them, in the last analysis, could bring himself to do so. In my concluding remarks, I shall present a hypothesis to explain why I believe that this was so. 3. THE FUNCTION OF RECENT THEORIES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES The basic mechanism by which attitudes and kinds of behavior are exemplified and maintained in force is the influence, often unconscious, of one person upon another. Individual human beings almost routinely and automatically conform their attitudes and ways of behaving to those of their neighbors. It is in this way that they learn to express themselves and to deal with their relatives and other associates. When these inter- personally transmitted and reinforced attitudes and ways of behaving are fairly widespread in a community, and when they persist for some time, they may be considered cultural traits. Time-extended networks of people linked by the transmission and rein- forcement of cultural traits stretch from the dawn of the human species down to the present, and show promise of continuing until mankind becomes extinct. If we may refer to these networks of interacting human beings as social media, we may distinguish two basic ways in which such media embody cultural traits. First, it is possible to discriminate long periods during which a compatible set of dominant cultural traits holds sway in a social medium. If the traits are mutually supporting, and if they apply to a maximum set of interacting persons, they comprise, roughly speaking, what Radcliffe-Brown called a social system. And it is the presence of such a system of dominant cultural traits that attracts field investigators to make synchronic studies.</page><page sequence="7">TWO KINDS OF THEORY IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 571 In the second place, we find periods during which the members of a social medium let one social system die out in the medium to be replaced by another. In such cases, it seems natural to speak of a social or cultural revolution in the medium. And it is populations undergoing this sort of change to which diachronic studies are customarily directed. Whether a field investigator is concerned with making a synchronic or a diachronic study, however, he will tend to identify with the social medium whose structure he seeks out. And because the future form of that structure, in the most interesting cases, can never be anticipated completely, he will tend to sympathize with the people who exhibit the attitudes and engage in the practices currently fashionable in the social medium, and to share their untestable belief in an ongoing societal force which sometimes causes a cultural trait to persist, and which sometimes brings about its replacement. If an investigator is inspired by such a feeling, however, he cannot afford in his theorizing to make precise a set of practices, beliefs and attitudes, however general, which might be construed as structural features of the social complex he is studying. For test results might then awkwardly reveal that the object of his inspiration, the social medium, had outlasted the social structure which was the professed object of his scientific con- cern. As long as his primary allegiance is to the social medium itself, whatever unanticipated forms it may assume, rather than to a particular set or system of structural relations, any empirical notion of a society, culture or complex institution must remain, for him, unspecifiable. To say this is not to condemn the authors of theories which make use of indeterminate notions of society or culture. For these theories are, never- theless, quite useful, if only indirectly so, in the quest for nomic regulari- ties about societies or cultures. In conclusion, I would like to state my view concerning the positive function of such theories. To being with, the members of each community investigated tend to share a group rationale - an untestable body of beliefs about the history nature and fate of the community as a whole. After conducting field investigations of several such communities, a veteran investigator like Benedict or Radcliffe-Brown generalizes from the rationales of the various groups, and in this way, arrives at a pure rationale which serves, in lieu of a currently unattainable deductive-nomothetic theory, as a theory of society or culture in general.</page><page sequence="8">572 PAUL G. MORRISON Such pro tempore theories, moreover, serve an important social function within the community of social scientists itself. For they provide an im- portant auxiliary means both of instilling, and of maintaining, a suitable professional attitude in serious students of society or culture who, in anticipation of the discovery of general causal regularities between cultural traits, must meanwhile persist in carefully tracing in further populations the socially transmitted machinery of need satisfaction mentioned earlier, in the hope that some future Kepler or Newton of the social sciences will perceive in it the patterns that sustain the long-awaited law-like connec- tions. Just as in psychotherapy, the treatment of individual patients must go on even where knowledge of relevant psychological laws is lacking;12 so in the social sciences, the study of individual social or cultural media must go on even though relevant systematic knowledge is not available. And hopefully, in the latter case as in the former, theoretical knowledge and knowledge gained by piecemeal observation of particular cases will sup- port one another more and more with the passage of time.
