<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Kiwis on ice: Defining the ways in  which the New Zealand identity is   reflected in the Antarctic-inspired  works of four New Zealand  composers  Patrick Shepherd1 Antarctica — ‘a poetical fantasy to range in’2 With the substantial body of work which has been produced by artists all over  the world from many artistic disciplines, critics are now in a good position to  examine exactly what the artist’s relationship is with Antarctica, both from the  artists’ own words and the work they have produced. Bringing the world to  the continent is certainly a literal reality for those who travel to Antarctica, but  the converse is also true, as each artist brings the continent back to the world.  It may also be true that Antarctica is the ultimate silence, a blank canvas upon  which each artist can project their own imagination. Interpreted differently,  it may be the ultimate silence because of the unique challenges it offers, what  Pyne describes as ‘an esthetic sink, not an inspiration. Its landscape erased those  elements which provided worlds accessible, and its fantastic isolation seemingly  defied any but self-referential attempts to assimilate it’.3  In looking at how the New Zealand artists relate to Antarctica — and in  particular the four composers discussed in this paper — it is perhaps helpful  to ascertain first what drivers New Zealanders exhibit. To merely describe  the Kiwi relationship with Antarctica as ‘unique’ is unhelpful. To paraphrase  Animal Farm, ‘Everyone is unique; we’re just more unique than them’, says  little about how one country relates to the continent. On a practical level, there  are the obvious geographical, political and economic links, but they are hardly  unique. The historical links such as Lyttelton and Timaru — places the heroic  1 Dr Patrick Shepherd, College of Education, University of Canterbury, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch,  New Zealand, patrick.shepherd@canterbury.ac.nz. 2 A Kippis (1788) The life of Captain James Cook.

New Zealand was also one of the countries to set up education, artists and writers  programs. The New Zealand government was a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty.  The Gateway Antarctica program continues to flourish at the University of  Canterbury where, incidentally, the Council of Managers of National Antarctic  Program currently resides. Of course, the Erebus disaster of 1979 where a  sightseeing plane crashed into Mount Erebus killing all 257 people on board is  still very raw in the Kiwi psyche.  Key indicators for the New Zealand identity Antarctica provides the ultimate wilderness for a country whose residents  exhibit a world-renowned sense of adventure and travel, as well as a love of the  outdoors and nature. New Zealand is an eco-friendly country, as well it might  be, for if climate change becomes a terminal reality and Antarctica reduces in  size through melting, New Zealand will be one of the first places to be affected.  Given all these factors the Kiwis’ near-obsession with their relationship to the  land is hardly surprising, particularly in the strong cultural and spiritual ties  exhibited by the Maori.  The relationship with the land is argued for strongly in the album Home,  Land and Sea (Trinity Roots 2004). Situating music in Aotearoa New Zealand4  follows on from Glenda Keam’s PhD thesis on the notions of national style in  contemporary New Zealand music, of which landscape plays a significant part.  Douglas Lilburn, the grandfather of modern New Zealand art music, believed  that the land and the environment could contribute to a national musical style  that he felt was missing. He also believed that there was a process whereby New  Zealand composers were being subconsciously formed and creatively affected  by the land and the environment, as evident in his claim that ‘this environment  of ours is shaping us into characteristic rhythms of living’.5 Of course, when all else fails, New Zealanders blame Australians, so perhaps  the whole New Zealand obsession with national identity in music was in part  due to Percy Grainger who spoke on New Zealand radio in 1935 giving New  Zealand composers their cue to look to the landscape for musical significance,  4 Glenda Keam and Tony Mitchell (2011) Home, land and sea: situating music in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Practica’s research — as  reported in Jane Clifton’s article ‘Choice, bro’7 — identified seven ‘legends’  (defining characteristics) for New Zealanders: relationship with the land,  independence and freedom, masculinity of expression, importance of sport,  ‘mateship’, being easy-going and non-confrontational, and a sense of humour.  Of these, perhaps ‘masculinity of expression’ and ‘mateship’ provide some of  the more subtle identifiers between Antarctica and New Zealand, a place to  get away from it all with your mates in much the same way as the hunter or  fisherman might trek off into the bush or high country for days on end. On a slightly less formal note — and out of the mouths of babes, as so often  the simple truths are — one need look no further than the website of Mrs  Brunton’s Year 8 class in room 28 at Marina View School who came up with,  ‘To me, being a Kiwi means that you box above your weight’; ‘It means NZ has  no pollution, great greenery, great oceans. Kiwis have freedom’; ‘We have the  chance to achieve great things’; and finally, ‘To watch the All Blacks versus the  Wallabies’.8 New Zealand’s relationship with Antarctica may also be seen as part of a ‘coming  of age’. In much the same way as the British Empire regarded it in the heroic  age, so Australia and New Zealand claiming their parts of Antarctica has been  part of those countries’ coming of age. Nazi Germany also saw it as strategically  desirable, establishing a base there during World War II, and the Americans  currently have a military presence, albeit benign. Hollywood has done much to  cement Antarctica in the popular culture through movies such as The Thing and  Alien vs Predator which choose the brutal isolation of Antarctica on which to  project the drama. Artist programs The US, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Chile and Argentina are  some of the countries that run — or have run — Antarctic artist schemes. From  all the different countries a significant body of Antarctic-related art has been  6 Keam and Mitchell (2011), p. 219. 7 New Zealand Listener (Online), 3 Jul 2010, vol 224(3660) issn:0110-5787. 8 http://www.marinav.school.nz/Site/Archive/2007/Team_Brunton/Room_28_-_Mrs_Brunton_-_Year_8. ashx, retrieved 19 June 2011. 153 </page> <page sequence="4"> Antarctica: Music, sounds and cultural connections established. The artists who have headed to Antarctica from New Zealand have  not always done so through government-assisted schemes. The practice started  in 1957 with painter Peter McIntyre and, later in 1970, with Royal New Zealand  Air Force official artist Maurice Conly. The New Zealand Artists to Antarctica  scheme (and a parallel education scheme) ran from 1997 to 2007 in conjunction  with Creative New Zealand, New Zealand’s main arts funding body. Currently,  two to three artists are selected annually by a panel and ‘shoulder-tapped’. The  45 artists New Zealand has sent to Antarctica represent most artistic disciplines:  painting, sculpture, musical composition and performance, furniture-making,  choreography, play and novel writing, poetry, photography, fashion design,  ceramics, printmaking, jewellery, and textile art. The Postgraduate Certificate  in Antarctic Studies, part of the University of Canterbury’s Gateway Antarctica  program, has also seen several artists including Laura Taylor (Antarctic Lullaby)  and Julian Evans (ice pipe installation) head south as part of their studies.  The four composers The four composers who are the subject of this paper are Chris Cree Brown,  Phil Dadson, myself and Gareth Farr. They are listed in the order in which  they travelled to Antarctica, Chris Cree Brown being the first, with the musical  excerpts played during the oral presentation at the conference listed at the start. Chris Cree Brown Under Erebus (2000) — electroacoustic Icescape (2003) — symphony orchestra  I had hoped to find sounds whose morphology and spectra I could  digitally transform to create abstract sounds that would reflect some  of the magnificence of the continent. This would create an expressive  link between a real, unaltered and recognisable sound source and more  abstract textures. My goal was to create an expressive work of sonic art that reflected  my personal interpretation of the environment of Antarctica and my  experiences while in Antarctica.  Prior to going down to the Ice, I classified the Antarctic sounds into four  different categories: 154 </page> <page sequence="5"> Kiwis on ice i) Environmental sounds: ice cracking, breaking and rumbling on the  Erebus ice tongue, tapping ice crystals, ice crystals shattering, and the  various types of wind (polar wind, Antarctic white out, katabatic wind).  ii) Wildlife: various species of penguins, skuas, petrels and underwater  vocalisations of seals. iii) Human activity: the effort in walking (panting), the squeaking of  footprints on snow (the snow in New Zealand is not dry enough for this  sound), ice breakers and the radio communications.  iv) Silence. Such a significant experience as Antarctica is bound to influence one  in a myriad of ways, and the Antarctic experience has allowed a new  perspective on environmental issues, and the fragility of our planet. One of the striking aspects of the Antarctic sound world is the apparent  incongruity of many sounds when compared to the environment. The  massive, majestic icescapes and graceful, sweeping glaciers evoke a  music that embodies grand, slow moving, dense and interweaving  textures. These characteristics seem to be the antithesis of the sounds  that are heard on the continent. The Antarctic Treaty acknowledges sound ecology and has set aside  some few thousand square miles where mechanical and other human  noise is prohibited. Ours is a world where noise (defined here as the  undesirable sonic by-product of human activity) and its insidious  psychological consequences on humanity has largely been ignored. In  the words of Canadian sound ecologist, R Murray Schafer, ‘It would  seem that noise pollution has reached an apex of vulgarity in our time’.  Antarctica, by contrast, appears as a near pristine environment, not  only with regard to its visual and physical environment, but also in its  sonic landscape. The tranquility in Antarctica is unfamiliar and, as a  consequence, marginally disturbing, especially when exacerbated by the  absence of ambient sound. The sociological, psychological and cultural  changes that have occurred as a direct consequence of the unrestrained  increase in and excessive intensity of noise pollution must be profound.  However, it is reassuring that our species has saved some small piece  of the planet in terms of sound ecology, even if there is nothing there  except ice. There is little doubt that when tourism in Antarctica becomes further  established, a corresponding quantity of noise will ensue and, as  elsewhere on the planet, assume a low priority in the pollution stakes.  155 </page> <page sequence="6"> Antarctica: Music, sounds and cultural connections Phil Dadson Flutter (2004) Stonemap (2005)  Chthonian Pulse (2005)  Excerpts played from Polar Projects (Flutter; Stonemap; Aerial Farms; Echo Logo) Any preconceptions I did have were made up of mental images conjured  from reading explorer accounts and from photographs, all fairly typical.  The actual experience far surpassed any imaginings, especially those  in the Dry Valleys. Nothing prepared me for the pristine temple-like  atmosphere of one stone valley floor in particular, which I nicknamed  ‘valley of the gods’. Wind-sculpted granite ventifacts, some strangely  anthropomorphic, surreally backgrounded against giant dunes of black  sand banked half way up one hundred foot high crystalline walls of ice.  The Antarctic experience was one I went into with all antennae bristling,  heightened somewhat by the prosthetics of a camera lens and a high- quality microphone. Above all, it reinforced for me the attitude of going  into a situation with as few preconceptions as possible; keeping an ear  and eye out for sounds and sonic images that might catch my attention,  and welcoming the unexpected — the ‘improviser’ sensibility. I was making field recordings with a Uher tape recorder around the  same time I first got interested in composing, and then later as a film- sound recordist, so the tape-recording medium and structuring and  editing processes have always been part of my compositional thinking.  I don’t make any separation really, between the act of composing in one  medium or another — whether it’s film, video, audio, an installation, a  music ensemble or combinations of — the process for me is very similar.  Summertime, January 2003, and a 24/7 period of daylight. I was going  out filming and recording most nights around 8 or 9 pm and returning  to the tent site at 3,4 or 5 in the morning. The light at so-called ‘night- time’ was so much better for recording video. It was like continuous  early morning or late afternoon light, devoid of the harshness of full  daytime sunlight. The sun would appear to strike a medium arc across  the sky during the main hours of daytime and then, at late afternoon  appear to just sit at one level close to the horizon line and remain there.  I was recording ice cracks for one entire night (without too much luck  I have to say) and during this time sat motionless, simply watching and  listening, much of the time focused on my relationship with the planet  156 </page> <page sequence="7"> Kiwis on ice and to the sun. Instead of watching the sun slowly creeping along the  horizon line, I could literally sense the earth turning around the sun. It  was a simple and profound sensation and it has stayed with me.  Polar Projects is as much a composition of elements, from my perspective,  as an installation. One [memory] I regularly return[ed] to was the physical  sensation of feeling an absolutely minuscule remote and insignificant  dot on the surface of the planet, and at the same time, awestruck with  a physical sensation of the me as a tiny dot on the earth turning around  the sun. It’s a rare opportunity and one that should be available to as many artists  as possible. Another time, I’d like to do a sequel that interfaced more  intentionally with specific locations, and with science teams as performer/ collaborators, maybe via another nation’s program. It’s provided a  heightened sense of urgency about the politics of impermanence. It’s  also polished the lens through which I view landscape and geography. Patrick Shepherd Katabatic (2005) — chamber ensemble Adeliesong (2005) — two clarinets Fanfare for a Frozen Land (2005) — orchestra Cryosphere (2005) — orchestra  I’ve always loved the ice and snow. Coming from the north of England  some of my earliest childhood memories are associated with snow —  that amazing light you sense when you first wake up and it’s lighter,  brighter and crisper than it usually is. I needed inspiration and thought  Antarctica might be interesting. I knew Chris [Cree Brown] had gone  and he reckoned it was life-changing so I decided to give it a go. I didn’t  expect it to become an all-consuming passion. Conrad’s Heart of Darkness is often used as a metaphor for Antarctic  — and Arctic — exploration, and I think that anyone who goes  there faces the ultimate truth that in an environment stripped bare of  virtually everything there really is nowhere else to run to — it’s you and  nature, face-to-face. Shackleton got it right when he said that Antarctic  exploration was not an outward journey but rather an inward journey  of discovery. 157 </page> <page sequence="8"> Antarctica: Music, sounds and cultural connections It’s really hard to try and see a stylistic change in my music, perhaps  because I’m too emotionally and chronologically close to the event.  Besides, people who claim they’ve ‘changed’ rarely have. I’m not  concerned as much with my audience, maybe. Don’t get me wrong, I  want to connect but I’m less concerned with the performance playing  out in my head as I write and more with the effect of the sounds. I  still write at the computer but I tend to sketch first on paper; there’s a  freedom of expression there that you just don’t get on the sequential  thinking of the computer.  I’m up the top of Observation Hill, which separates Scott Base from  McMurdo Station. It’s snowing, I’m scared stiff because I’ve just climbed  up a steep hill having not told anyone where I am (an absolute no-no  down there) and I’m looking at the jarrah cross that bears the famous  quote from Ulysses in memory of Scott and his four doomed companions.  I was very proud to be British, very proud to be a Kiwi and ecstatic that  I was an Antarctican. Anyone who calls Scott an idiot misses the point  — there’s some stuff in life bigger than life itself and dying might be the  last thing that happens to you but it may not be the worst.  I expected to come away so full of inspiration that the artistic juices  would flow freely. Instead, I got a kind of block which lasted for over  six months. Science — that was my only way through. I had a kind of  block, the subject matter was so big and there’s only so much stuff you  can write that sounds like Arvo Pärt, so I moved away from the purely  descriptive and found inspiration in the little things, the minutiae,  the scientific stuff — and the human interest aspects. I started on  Katabatic — which was a 30 second microscore — to get me working,  then I moved on to Adeliesong, replicating the additive rhythm call of  the penguins, which I then orchestrated out into Fanfare for a Frozen  Land. The layering of the orchestration in Cryosphere took its inspiration  from using a Kovacs drill on field training at Scott Base and seeing the  different strata of ice and debris.  Stephen Pyne’s book The Ice was brilliant. When you’re there the beakers  (scientists) tend to regard the artists as a bit ‘arty-farty’ (which we know  can be true) but we also end up putting a human and a more publicly  accessible front to much of the hard science they’re dealing with. If we  (the artists) can bring the issues closer to people, particularly in schools,  we might have a chance of getting science front and centre, too. 158 </page> <page sequence="9"> Kiwis on ice Gareth Farr Terra Incognita (2007) — tenor, chorus and orchestra  There are two overwhelming things that hit you in the face when you go  to Antarctica. The first is that the world is a very scary place. It’s fierce,  unrelenting, and non-negotiable. The second is that the world is a very  fragile place. If something that appears so invincible, so powerful, and  so eternal can be falling apart because of what us humans have done in  the last hundred years or so, then we have really screwed up badly. I went to Antarctica with the expectation of discovering a landscape,  a physical geographical experience — but returned to New Zealand  having not only experienced that, but also a foreign culture, in exactly  the same way as I have in the US, in Indonesia, in Australia. There is  Scott Base, which is obviously profoundly Kiwi, and there is McMurdo  Station — five minutes away by road — which is just like being in  the US — currency, accents, everything. But there is an overriding  Antarctic culture there — an understanding of things that they all have  in common that are utterly peculiar to Antarctica — such as safety/  survival issues, scientific issues, general things you just have to know to  exist in a space station-like environment. I don’t think my compositional style has altered because of Antarctica  per se — writing a piece for bass voice and orchestra taught me a huge  amount about balancing a singer with an orchestra, which will impact  on every piece I write for singer (or any soloist for that matter) and  orchestra in the future. It also was my first major dramatic piece, where  I had to look at the piece as a piece of theatre, and structure/pace it  accordingly. I’m not a word person — I’d be an author otherwise — it’s not my talent  to put an experience into words. I’ve always hated the idea of expressing  landscape in music — in fact I’ve never been that keen on expressing  anything visual in music — because I don’t think that music exists for  that purpose. Music is music. I don’t even like writing program notes  — to me they seem like an apology because the music wasn’t capable of  communicating to the audience.  So to write a piece of music inspired by my experience in Antarctica was  utterly impossible, based on my self-imposed restrictions! But there was  a moment — the epiphany moment! — when I realised that it was the  people who have been to Antarctica in the last hundred years; that is  what I can reflect in my music.  159 </page> <page sequence="10"> Antarctica: Music, sounds and cultural connections Basically what happened is that the minute I realised the project was  about people and their relationship to the continent, as opposed to  a musical representation of the geographical features, I had a major  epiphany. I had talked to Paul Whelan (Kiwi singer, then based in  London) about a piece a few years earlier, and we had in mind a piece  for bass voice and orchestra — but as always happens the idea had fallen  by the wayside because neither of us had the funding to do anything.  The epiphany was — ‘oh my God, this is the piece — I need the epic  sound of an orchestra, and I need the human communication of a singer  — this is the piece!’ My general outlook changed in a very specific way — ecologically. Conclusion The experiences of the four New Zealand composers demonstrates not only  how their personal horizons broadened but also how the journey south offers  a unique opportunity to compare and contrast their work in a unique way. It  is indeed rare to be able to make such direct comparisons between the works  of people operating in a similar discipline exposed to exactly the same stimuli  and as such provides an invaluable insight into not only how the creative mind  operates but also how art interacts with life on the ice. 160 </page> </plain_text>
