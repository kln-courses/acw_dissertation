<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sexual Discourse in the Parisian Chanson: A Libidinous Aviary* BY KATE VAN ORDEN TN 1571, there appeared from the Parisian presses of Jean Ruelle a I small book in the form of a recueil de poesie entitled La Description philosophale, de la nature &amp; condition des oyseaux, &amp; de l'inclination &amp; proprifti d'iceux. The book was a pocket encyclopedia of birds, including for each entry a miniature engraving, prose information on habitat, mating rituals, nesting habits, physiology, edibility, and so forth, and two poems, the first descriptive and the second a poetic moral. Its melange of myth, facts gained through observation, dietary recommendations based on elemental science, poetry, and moraliza- tion of natural philosophy typifies the breadth of mid-century scien- tific inquiries. Of the sparrow, for example, we learn that it is one of the most lustful birds in the world owing to its great heat, and for this reason-here is the moral-it represents a lewd and carnal man who hides in his house, immersed in libidinous behavior. We are also warned that the sparrow's inclination to sing provokes "the desire of lust" in those who consume its flesh. In the most general sense, La Description philosophale is the product of a sixteenth-century vogue for cataloguing flora and fauna, especially the monstrous and exotic. Its text is so limited and its engravings so generic in their tiny one-by-one-inch format that the book's actual descriptive capabilities are reduced to almost nothing, however. Rather than listing birds in an encyclopedic style, La Description philosophale is finally much more concerned with the philosophical cataloguing of human morality through images of birds. The poetic morals in La Description philosophale that liken various species of birds to the denizens of French society convey each bird's natural attributes as human characteristics (see Table I). The songbirds, as a class, are used to comment on the vices and virtues surrounding sexual behav- *An earlier version of this essay was presented at the Fifty-ninth Annual Meeting of the American Musicological Society, Montreal, November 1993.

The whores and trollops of society are represented not by songbirds, but by the duck, quail, and partridge for their closeness to the earth, to dirt in the most physical sense. Birds like the parrot, sparrow, and cuckoo depict masculine sexual errancy, while the songs of the cicada and nightingale are said to express religious faith. The fidelity of men, we might note, is not registered within the marital bond that women are meant to honor, but is owed to God. In sum, the moralizing poems serve as a field guide to French society, turning each bird into the icon of a moral state and eliding the encyclopedic tradition with another trend in which the French became obsessed with ordering their members according to social class against the measure of noble behavior. The sixteenth century witnessed an unsettling social mobility in France that seems to have been balanced by a rigidification of social hierarchies in the seventeenth century. New sumptuary laws and increasingly fine legal definitions of noble status were only the initial outward consequences of this classifying process.' Such class con- sciousness also produced a whole literature outlining the kinds of behavior that would lead to true nobility of character, a body of texts to which we shall return at the end of this essay.2 La Description ' See especially Michel de Montaigne, "Des loix somptuaires" in the Essais, ed.

If the sparrow's song led inexorably to sexual activity, what was the effect of human song? How did the chanson-man's artificial version of nature's song as sounded by birds-express erotic desire and encode moral dicta? The question inspires a revisiting of the Parisian chanson repertory. Why did composers turn again and again to texts featuring birds? Was the intention a pursuit of eros? Unlike any other animal, songbirds recur with impressive frequency in the chanson repertory, symbolizing song's sexual power. In the i570s alone, sixty-five chansons printed in Paris set texts featuring birds (see Table 2).3 The importance of birds as a chansonesque icon for the handling of sexuality can be partially explained by the poetic conventions organizing modes of erotic expression in mid-century French lyric poetry. Early sixteenth-century poetic conventions, defined largely by their opposing treatments of eroticism, tended to make a sharp distinction between a high style of lyric utterance tied to the spiritual aims of courtly love and a lower, vulgar style-carnivalesque, it has been called-that accommodated sexually explicit material.4 In the 3Bird imagery in music has a venerable history predating the repertory I discuss here, most proximately in Clement Janequin's musical imitations of bird songs, "Le Chant des oyseaux," "Le Chant du rossignol," and "Le Chant de l'alouette," all printed in the Verger de musique (Paris: Le Roy &amp; Ballard, 1559). A recent study by Richard d'A. Jensen traces the musical imitation of birdsong in the Western repertory, discussing the transcription of birdsong in musical notation and providing a compre- hensive list of these imitative songs. See his "Birdsong and the Imitation of Birdsong in the Music of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance," Current Musicology 40 (1985): 50-65. Birds as songsters are also recurrent images in Western art. See, for example, A. P. de Mirimonde, "Les Concerts parodiques chez les maitres du Nord," Gazette des beaux-arts 64 (1964): 253-84. The theme of "concerts d'oiseaux," or birds singing from musical scores, is one used in illuminating fourteenth-century missals. It became quite popular as a subject for oil paintings in the seventeenth-century Flemish school of Jan Breugel the Younger and his students Jan Fyt and Hans Snyders. 4 Several previous studies have proposed typologies of the sixteenth-century chanson that are text-based. Scholars working with early sixteenth-century chansons have regularly described their repertories in terms of a courtly-gaulois opposition much like the one I adopt. Such studies include most recently Howard Mayer Brown, A Florentine Chansonnier from the Time of Lorenzo the Magnificent: Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale MS Banco Rari 229, vol. 7 of Monuments of Renaissance Music (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, I983), pt. 2, 52-70; Leeman Perkins and Howard Garey, eds., The Mellon Chansonier (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1979), 2:63-79; and Lawrence Bernstein, ed., La Couronne et fleur des chansons a troys, vol. 3 of Masters and Monuments of the Renaissance (New York: Broude Trust, 1984), pt. 2, 24-27. Bernstein's typology is based on the one set forth in Marcel Franqon, ed., Ponmes de transition (XVe-XVIe sicles): Rondeaux du Ms. 402 de Lille (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, and Paris: Droz, 1938), 40-47 (Franqon, however, explains what he sees as the schizophrenic erotic dualism of this literature in</page><page sequence="4">4 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY first part of this essay, I focus on the means by which bird songs conveyed their erotic messages through the idioms of the courtly style and its carnivalesque reversal. In the second part, we will see that Pierre de Ronsard's transformation of avian topoi forges a more fully sexual lyricism that moves within the conventions traditionally sepa- rating love and sex at the same time that it exceeds those boundaries and seeks to efface them. Courtly and Carnivalesque Birds Representing the singing courtier who languishes from unrequited love and his sexual organ in turn, birds were special signifiers linking song and sex in unique sets of references that played both sides of the courtly-carnivalesque bifurcation. These complex associations polar- ized the body itself along a vertical axis; speech, the spiritual aspects of love, and lyric creation were situated in the upper bodily stratum while sexuality, the physicality of love, and procreation were confined to the lower bodily stratum.5 In this paradigm, the proscriptions against sex terms of societal upheaval and transition-thus the tide of the collection). For a similar bipartite typology of an Italian repertory, see William F. Prizer, "Games of Venus: Secular Vocal Music in the Late Quattrocento and Early Cinquecento," The Journal of Musicology 9 (i99I): 3-56. Leeman Perkins, in his recent article "Toward a Typology of the 'Renaissance' Chanson," The Journal ofMusicology 6 (1988): 421-47, distinguishes three categories of texts in the mid-century chanson-courtly, rural, urban-but tends to deal with them in his essay in the traditional bifurcation of courtly and popular (pp. 426-32). The idea of courtly love has been under considerable attack in scholarly literature during the past few decades, resulting in some provocative studies, both pro and con. I adopt the stance that whatever the roots of the term itself, the concept had powerful currency in the late sixteenth-century chanson repertory. As Peter Dronke sagely remarked in Medieval Latin and the Rise of European Love-Lyric (Oxford: Clarendon, 1965), the idea of courtly love "is a garden in which roots can seldom be disentangled, and in which it is far more important to watch the growth of the flowers" (p. 56). The most important scholarly literature speaking against the use of the term includes D. W. Robertson, "The Concept of Courtly Love as an Impediment to the Understanding of Medieval Texts," in The Meaning of Courtly Love, ed. F. X. Newman (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1968), i-18, and reprinted in his Essays in Medieval Culture (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980); and E. T. Donaldson, "The Myth of Courtly Love," in Speaking of Chaucer (London: Athlone Press, 1970), 154-63. The debate is summarized in Roger Boase, The Origin and Meaning of Courtly Love: A Critical Study of European Scholarship (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977). 5 Our current critical ways of thinking about carnivalesque rhetoric are indebted to Mikhail Bakhtin's seminal study Rabelais and His World, trans. Hel6ne Iswolsky (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1984). Bakhtin's thesis was that the gro- tesque figures and wild exaggeration in Rabelais that gave rise to Gargantua and Pantagruel provided a mirror reversal of authority, whether represented by the</page><page sequence="5">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 5 TABLE 2 Texts Featuring Birds Used in Polyphonic Chansons Printed in Paris, 157o-80 Poet/Textual Incipit Sourcea Composer(s) Arreste un peu mon coeur Desportes Costeley Au bois, au bois Madame Moulu Bel Aubepin verdissant Ronsard Janequin, Millot Bon jour mon coeur Ronsard Castro, Lassus, Monte Ce que mon coeur pense Mouton Comme l'aigle fond Ronsard Cl reau Comme la torterelle - Ou t'attend ta Castro, Lassus, Monte maitresse Dedans ce bois ny a beste Regnard Dieu te gard, bergere Nicolas, De Bussi En ce beau moys Costeley En escoutant le chant Recueil tout soulas Certon En revenant du bois Jardin du plaisance Richafort Herbes &amp; fleurs Costeley, Hauville He que voulez vous dire Ronsard Boni, Millot Il est bon enfant Nicolas Il estjour dict l'Alouette Certon Ilfait bon aymer l'oysillon Chans. 1538 Penet(?)

First, courtly love lyrics employ a series of conceits that accommodate the treatment of sexuality through double-entendre: the poet's love-death is understood simultaneously as the result of mortal languishing and sexual climax.6 The second mode of erotic discourse allows for explicit depiction of sexual acts in carnivalesque language, engaging popular characters such as libidinous shepherds and shepherdesses or amorous birds in its stories of bucolic sexual encounter. One of the oldest and most persistent images in the courtly chanson repertory is that of the caged nightingale.7 "The nightin- gale," we learn from La Description philosophale, "does not want to be held encaged and one can only feed it with great difficulty if it is not free." The poet, whose heart is bound by love, similarly languishes with passion; the song of the imprisoned bird gives voice to the courtier's plaint. In the chanson "O ma belle maitresse," with a text by Ronsard, the caged nightingale is a gift from the lover to his mistress. church, the academy, or the monarchy. Many of these images of abasement, argued Bakhtin, could be tied to traditions of popular-festive merriment such as carnival, markets and fairs, and the informal popular celebrations (like carnival) that came along with religious feasts: St. John's Day and Corpus Christi to name but two. With carnival came a subversion of the status quo: it was a period during which marital vows of fidelity were temporarily suspended, a time to crown fools as kings or to uncrown these royal travesties with thrashings. All-important among the many dichotomies that Bakhtin describes is the oppo- sition between high and low. Heaven and hell, holy and profane, courtly and popular are all oppositions built on the high/low vertical axis along which carnivalesque debasement takes place. The body itself is divided into strata of high and low where the functions of the upper body are dominated by thought and speech while those of the "material bodily lower stratum," as Bakhtin calls it, are governed by the materiality of physical existence: defecation, copulation, pregnancy, and childbirth. In Rabelais's amazingly fecund idealization of the bodily lower stratum, even excrement is linked to generative forces and fertility (pp. 173-76). For him, moreover, the body itself allowed for carnivalesque reversal: the nose was linked to the phallus in assumptions that they were related in size (pp. 86-87), and the ass was considered a "second face." 6 The conceits of the illness of love/desire to which the mistress holds the cure and the love-death constitute the most prevalent courtly themes in the late sixteenth- century chanson repertory. For a more general discussion of courtly love at this time, see Boase, Origin and Meaning, 5-53, who describes the characteristics of courtly love as seen by various writers from the sixteenth century on. See also the important study by D. W. Robertson, A Preface to Chaucer: Studies in Medieval Perspectives (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1962). 7 In a reversal of this common theme, "Le Rossignol plaisant et gracieux" contrasts the freedom of the uncaged bird with the lover's heart held hostage by the snares of sadness.</page><page sequence="7">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 7 By sounding the poet's grief in her ear with its warbling, the nightingale transforms the verse emanating from the poet's lyre into pure music, and acts as an agent of desire reminiscent of Cupid: Allez donc Roussignol, en sa chambre, &amp; sonnez Mon dueil a son oreille avec vostre ramage, Et s'il vous est possible 6mouvez le courage De ma dame a pitie, puis vous en revenez. (11. 5-8)8 The nightingale's song holds the promise of persuading the beloved's heart to greater tenderness for her suitor, since music stirs the passions. The nightingale has a privileged access to the bedroom of the mistress, in which it serves as the lover's envoy. Its voice in her private chambers is a reminder of her suitor's desires. In this, as in many other chansons, the nightingale also acts as the lover's confidant and a messenger to the beloved. One of the more popular chanson texts of the sixteenth century, "Je suis desherit6e," features the nightingale in the reverse role of the mistress's envoy.9 Rossignol du bois joly, Sans plus faire demeur&amp;e, Va t'en dire a mon amy, Que pour luy suis tourment6e. (11. 5-8)'o Likewise, in the Anacreontic verse "Mignarde colombelle," Venus has sold her dove to the "pobte gaillard" Anacreon, who sends it off to deliver a sonnet to his mistress. The nightingale, or rossignol, was easily the most popular of the songbirds featured in the chanson repertory, its lesser colleagues including the turtledove, dove, sparrow, lark, swallow, hoopoe, cuckoo, woodpigeon, chaffinch, and linnet (respectively tourterelle, columbelle, passereau, allouette, hirondelle, huppe, coucou, ramier, pinson, and lynote). The popularity of the nightingale with lyric poets likely arose not only from the beauty of its song but also from its notoriety-according to the natural historian Pierre Belon-as the only bird who sang the entire night without sleeping." It easily 8 "Go therefore Nightingale, in her bedroom, &amp; sound My grief in her ear with your warbling, And if it is possible for you to rouse the heart Of my Lady to pity, then return [from there]." 9 "Je m'en vois au vert bois" and "Herbes &amp; fleurs" also feature birds in role of messengers. " "Beautiful nightingale of the woods, Without remaining any longer, Go to tell my lover, That for him I am tormented." " Pierre Belon, L'Histoire de la nature des oyseaux, avec leurs descriptions; &amp; naifs portraicts retirez du naturel: escrite en sept livres, par Pierre Belon du Mans (Paris: Cavellat, 1555), 335-</page><page sequence="8">8 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY symbolized the lover's restless heart, as its nocturnal song conjured notions of amorous serenades. The nightingale's ancient mythical origin is recounted in the sixth book of Ovid's Metamorphoses with the story of Philomela, for which it was named. I paraphrase the myth as recounted in Belon's impres- sive seven-volume compendium on bird life, Nature des oyseaux: Tereus, the king of Thrace, upon first meeting his sister-in-law Philomela, became quite amorous, but concealed his love. In the end, to obtain his desire he raped her, cutting out her tongue to prevent her from telling her sister, Procne. Procne discovered the crime nevertheless, and the two sisters together killed the son of Tereus, that he should be made to eat his son for dinner. At the meal, Philomela hid herself behind a curtain and when Tereus asked for his son, she threw the still bloody head at his face. Tereus was so frightened that he took his sword to kill the two sisters, but by the will of the gods, Tereus was changed into a hoopoe, Procne was changed into a swallow, and Philomela was changed into a nightingale, that she would lament incessantly, decrying the injury against her with her languorous song." ." "Ceux qui le nommerent Phylomela, emprunterent le nom d'une fable anci- enne, qui dit que Pandion Roy d'Athenes eut deux filles, l'une Progn6, I'autre Phlyomela. Progn6 estoit mariee ' Tereus Roy de Thrace. Icelle ayant demeur6 avec luy l'espace de cinq ans, luy vint vouloir de voir sa soeur qui estoit en Athenes: parquoy pria Tereus vouloir qu'il l'envoyast querir: mais il y voulut aller luy mesme. Et s'estants embarquez passerent la mer. Estant Tereus arriv6 li, des-ce qu'il eut veue Phylomela, en devint amoureux: toutesfois celant son amour, en fin obtint son desir, il la viola. Iceluy voyant qu'elle en estoit moult courroucee, luy coupa la langue, de peur qu'elle ne le signifiast a sa soeur: joinct qu'il la tenoit enfermee. Alors Phylomela se va aviser de tirer a l'eguille sur la toile, le tort que Tereus luy avoit fait, &amp; l'envoya a sa soeur: laquelle pour venger l'injure, fit venir Phylomela, &amp; tuerent Itis fils de Tereus, pour luy en faire manger a disner. Phylomela se tenoit cachee derriere une tapisserie jusques a ce que Tereus demanda ou estoit Itis. Alors Phylomela, que en tenoit la teste encore sanglante, la rua au visage de Tereus: lequel s'estant effray6 de ce qui en estoit advenu, tira son espee pour les tuer toutes deux. Mais par le vouloir des dieux Tereus fut converty en Hupe, Progn6 fut convertie en Hirondelle, dont est que les poetes escrivent que l'Hirondel le pleure la mort d'Itis: &amp; Phylomela fut convertie en Rossignol, affin que se lamentant incessamment, elle enseignast l'injure du meffait avec son chant langoreux. II semble que Martial veuille parler de luy, quand il dit, Sic vbi multisona feruet sacer Atide lucus" (ibid., 355-56). Belon's final quote is drawn from Martial's epigrams, I, 53. In a general way, Nature des oyseaux relies heavily on Aristotle's Historia animalium and Pliny's Historia naturalis, gleaning names and descriptions of some birds from the ancients, as well as mining sources such as Ovid for myths relating to birds. Although Belon's version of Ovid's myth is fairly faithful, there are some differences. For example, in Ovid, the sisters actually serve Itys, dismembered and cooked, at the banquet, and Tereus eats him. Also, in Ovid's tale it is Procne who becomes a nightingale and Philomela a swallow. In this detail Ovid follows Sophocles. In Vergil, however, Philomela is the nightingale, and so in most Roman writers thereafter and in Western tradition. I thank Leofranc A.</page><page sequence="9">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 9 In this gruesome tale, the crime of sexual transgression and the murder it spawns are punished with the transformation of all three characters into birds. Philomela's metamorphosis reverses the silence brutally imposed upon her by making her the most vocal of birds, the nightingale. But in her avian form, Philomela-along with Tereus and Procne-reminds the reader that one consequence of sexuality is speechlessness. In the end, although no longer mute, Philomela's defilement robs her of her higher powers of speech and casts her into a perpetual state of inarticulate lamentation. While birds in chanson texts typically served as symbols of lyric utterance, they also often mirrored the love relations of humans, an aspect of their multiple associations evident in La Description philos- ophale discussed above. The turtledove, for example, was a frequent symbol of fidelity in courtly chansons: it was thought to live in chastity if its mate died, and to sing only if in love, thus guarding against the excessive passion song could inspire. Like the courtly suitor, ever faithful to his mistress, the turtledove preferred to languish to its death rather than take another mate. Belon reports in his Nature des oyseaux that the turtledove "is said to be chaste and not to search for companionship when its mate has died."'3 In the hands of Ronsard, the turtledove's traditional plaint is enhanced by allusions to classical mythology. T. Un cruel oyselleur par glueuse cautelle L'a prise, &amp; l'a tu6e: &amp; nuit &amp; jour je chante Son trespas dans ces bois, nommant la mort m6chante Qu'elle ne m'a tu6e aveques ma fidelle. R. Voudrois-tu bien mourir aveques ta compaigne? T. Oui, car aussi bien je languis de douleur, Et toujours le regret de sa mort m'acompaigne. (11. 5-11)'4 Here, Orpheus's lament upon losing Eurydice resonates below the surface of the text, linking the lyricism of the turtledove's courtly lament with the founder of lyric poetry himself and underscoring the image of birds as nature's lyric poets. Holford-Strevens for bringing this discrepancy to my attention and for his helpful explanation of this myth's various traditions. 13 Belon, Nature des oyseaux, 3 10. '4 "Turtledove: A cruel bird-catcher by sticky guile Took her and killed her: and night and day I sing Her death in these woods, calling death evil That it did not kill me with my love. Ronsard: Would you really want to die with your companion? Turtledove: Yes, for I languish just as well from grief And the regret of her death always accompanies me."</page><page sequence="10">IO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY As noted above, birds played an important role in carnivalesque chanson verse alongside their place as a staple theme of courtly lyric poetry. One way in which these ribald and sexually more explicit chansons were distanced from the courtly style was through the careful choice of subjects: the carnivalesque world was popu- lated not by courtiers and their ladies, but by errant nuns, shepherds, shepherdesses, and libidinous birds.'5 Expressions of carnal desire deemed intolerable within the courtly sphere were permissible in this libidinous underworld where fantasies with no place in the pristine "high" style might be played out among birds and paysans for the amusement of courtiers. This is not to deny the truly popular origins of some of these chansons; it is rather to recognize that even "popular" chansons appropriated or groomed for the courtly sphere must be viewed as part of the courtly dialectic in which references to physical desire may take only very specific forms. As circulated in popularesque idioms, the fiction of upper-class decorum operates under the assumption that inter- course was for birds, servants, and errant clergy. In their reversal of courtly tenets, such chansons seem both to reinscribe the nobility of sexual abstinence and to question it at the same time. Birds were central carnivalesque subjects. The members of this feathered society made it possible to play out the low physicality of sexual stories through a particularly graphic set of associations, for in chansons birds were often featured as referents for male and female genitalia. In the anonymous text of "Dieu te gard, bergere," a hunter asks the shepherdess he meets, "Haven't you seen my wild bird?"'6 Ne l'as-tu point veu, mon oyseau sauvage? Depuis le matin, il est au rivage, 's Bakhtin's characterization of carnivalesque popular-festive merriment in Rabe- lais and His World informs my typology of eroticism: chansons that can be considered "carnivalesque" act to reverse or overturn the tenets of courtly love. In their downward movements, these chansons often focus on the genitalia, sexual intercourse, and the transgression of vows of celibacy, chastity, and fidelity. Through recourse to licentiousness, carnivalesque chansons undermine the authority of unrequited love that governs the idioms of courtly lyric. '6This chanson plays off of the "Robin and Marion" story familiar to musicolo- gists from Adam de la Halle's "Jeux de Robin et Marion" in which the sexual subtext turns around a knight-errant's falcon.</page><page sequence="11">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY I I Mon oyseau sauvage, mon joly faucon, don, don, Qui prent la becasse, connins de saison, don don. (11. 5-8)'7 Oiseau has long been a word with phallic meaning in French. Were there any doubt that this passage reads as an invitation to sex, then certainly the image of the "oyseau sauvage" catching the "connins de saison" would make the symbolism explicit. Connin, while it can be read to mean rabbit, was also widely used in the sixteenth century as the diminutive form of a now vulgar term for female genitalia. Its common usage is attested by this anonymous Blason du corps fminin to the vagina: Petit mouflard, petit con rebondy, Petit connin plus que levrier hardy'8 Thus the story told in "Dieu te gard, bergere" is one in which the hunter's falcon is lost chasing rabbits, just as the hunter plans to "lose" his own sexual member in the shepherdess. Birds most commonly represent male desire in the chanson repertory through such stock associations. In a softening of oiseau's phallic implications, birds often portray popularesque suitors in a more general sense. Both "Il est bon enfant" and "Ce que mon coeur pense" are cast in the feminine voice and speak of a singing bird in the garden as a metaphor for a visiting lover. "Ce que mon coeur pense," extending this metaphor, comments on the transitory nature of love by referring to the flightiness of birds. Elsewhere in chansons, women are also associated with bird life. Whereas the bird often represented the masculine sexual member, its nest, not surprisingly, referred to female genitalia. "Au bois, au bois madame," a rondeau set by Moulu, features this image of a nest while encouraging the lady to whom the song is addressed to come into the woods with the singer. Au bois, au bois ma dame, Au joli bois m'en vois. En celui bois ma dame Sqav6s vous qu'il y a, '7 "Haven't you seen my wild bird? Since the morning, he is at the river, My wild bird, my pretty falcon, don, don, Who catches the woodcock, rabbits in season, don, don." s8 "Little fat-cheeked one, little rounded vagina, Little rabbit rather than a bold greyhound" (Pontes du XVIe sidcle, ed. Albert-Marie Schmidt [Paris: Gallimard, 1953], 337).</page><page sequence="12">12 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY Un nid, un nid ma dame Un nid d'oyseaux y a. Au bois, au bois ma dame, Au joli bois m'en vois. En celui nid ma dame Sqav6s vous qu'il y a, Trois vifz, trois vifz ma dame Trois vifz oyseaux y a. Au bois, au bois ma dame, Aujoli bois m'en vois.'9 The speaker only gradually reveals what fills the nest in the woods, pausing to repeat the refrain that ushers the lady into the forest. In a titillating play of visual metaphor the moment of revelation is equated with the act of sexual penetration, as she visualizes the nest full of birds and becomes the bird-filled nest herself. The linking of penetrating sight and the awakening of desire is pervasive in chansons, where the moment of first attraction is typically expressed in ocular images."2 "Au bois, au bois, madame" transforms that courtly metaphor, figuring sight in terms of carnal knowledge and in this way perhaps drawing on an ancient, classical tradition."2 Finally, in the carnivalesque chansons of the early sixteenth century, birds are occasionally depicted in the act of making love. A particularly graphic chanson in this regard, "Sur la rous6e," seems to have held an endless fascination for its audience: the text appears in at least four recueils de podsie, 2 in musical settings printed by Attaingnant, and in two settings printed by Le Roy &amp; Ballard, including one in the seminal 15 572 Mellange de chansons.

To the woods, to the woods my lady, To the beautiful woods I am going. In this nest my lady Do you know what there is, Three lively, three lively my lady There are three lively birds. To the woods, to the woods my lady, To the beautiful woods I am going." 2o See, most importantly, the first four sonnets in Ronsard's Les Amours, ed. Henri Weber and Catherine Weber (Paris: Classiques Gamier, i993), 4-6, all of which were set as chansons and all of which liken the moment of first love to darts thrown from the mistress's eyes that pierce the lover's heart. Likewise, see the character "Doux Regard" in the Roman de la rose (11. 906-30), who also throws penetrating ocular "arrows.7" 2" For an excellent exploration of the Diana myth and the operation of visual- sexual metaphors, particularly in Petrarch's verse, see Nancy Vickers, "Diana Described: Scattered Woman and Scattered Rhyme," in Writing and Sexual Diference, ed.

Et puis la renverser en bas, Comme amoureux font par esbas, Sur la rousee.23 The refrain of this song-"sur la rous e"-apparently carried special implications all its own, for the image of dew in other chansons is invariably linked to stories of pastoral escapades."4 We will see that in songs setting Pierre de Ronsard's verse, the poetics of birds is situated in just such a bucolic setting, where sexuality can take a more natural turn. In this respect Ronsard's bird songs resonate with earlier carnivalesque lyrics like "Sur la rous6e," turning to rustic erotic idioms as they question the artificiality of moral constructs in the face of nature's power. Birds, Cosmic Harmony, and Ronsardian Eroticism As the above examples illustrate, birds had long been associated with libidinous behavior, but in the mid-sixteenth century, as the continued recovery and dispersion of classical texts reshaped the sciences, the common vision of birds as highly sexed entities came to be explained in light of a new rationalism as well. Many of these descriptions were couched in the familiar Aristotelian terms of elements and humors fundamental to scholastic philosophy, in which the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire) provided physicians with a system for the interpretation of disease through the humors they created. Taking Girolamo Cardano's De subtilitate as a guide (in a 23 "Over the dew I must go in the morning, To listen to the Rossignol under the arbor, Holding his lady under the arms, Asking an embrace of him for pleasure, And then to throw her down beneath him, Like lovers do for pleasure, Over the dew. And then to throw her down beneath him, Like lovers do for pleasure, Over the dew." 24 As in "La rousee de mois de may, M'a gast6 ma verte cotte, Par un matin m'y levay, En un jardin m'en entray, Dittes vous que je suis sotte" ("The dew of the month of May, Has spoiled my green skirt, One morning I was awakened, I entered a garden, You say that I am crazy"). This song shares with "Sur la rousee" not only the image of morning dew but also the idea of entering a garden or arbor, reminiscent of the Roman de la rose.</page><page sequence="14">14 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY contemporary French translation entitled De la subtiliti),25 we see that the elements of fire and water were considered to be the principal ingredients of man.'6 L'homme donques est tres chaud &amp; humide naturellement, pource il est de mauvaises moeurs, par la chaleur il devient cruel, fraudulent, incon- stant, &amp; plein d'ire: par l'humidite il est mal, effemin6, impatient de labeur, &amp; amateur des delices: par les deux, sqavoir est, par chaleur &amp; humidit6, il est gourmand &amp; libidineux.7 Here, heat and moisture function together to define the qualities leading to sexual activity in a subtly gendered characterization. Heat seems to give rise to the male-oriented Martial traits of wrath and cruelty while Venusian feminine traits such as weakness and the love of sensual pleasures are attributed to moisture. As the passage continues, Cardano embroiders his text with further examples of the elements' effects, and as he reaffirms the libidinous aspect of their properties, we find that these are elements shared by birds. Small wonder, then, that in this chapter "On the nature and temperament of man," birds form a frequent source of comparison, notably in the discussion of male sexuality: Pourtant l'homme entre tous animaux terrestres est le plus prepat6 " Venus, pource qu'il est tres chaud &amp; humide: il est toutesfois surmont6 25 Les Livres de Hierosme Cardanus medecin milannois intitulez de la subtiliti &amp; subtiles inventions, ensemble les causes occultes &amp; raisons d'icelles traduits de latin en frangois par Richard le Blanc (Paris: Abel I'Angelier, 1584).

Ronsard's copy of the book is preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, with the shelf number Res. R. 2775- 26 Cardano presents a perfect example of how the Aristotelian tradition was gradually eroded through critique brought to bear on it by newer natural philosophies such as hermeticism and Paracelsianism based on the recovery of classical texts, or by philosophies based on individual scientific observation. Cardano was a mathematician, alchemist, and doctor. While these excerpts from De la subtiliti might seem to align his work with a scholastic, Aristotelian tradition, elsewhere, for example, he ques- tioned fire's place as one of the elements. Cardano might thus best be thought of as working within a newer philosophical framework that elides the old and the new. For an excellent overview of the schools of French natural philosophy at midcentury, see Allen G. Debus, The French Paracelsians: The Chemical Challenge to Medical and Scientific Traditions in Early Modern France (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 1-16. 27 "Man is therefore naturally very hot and moist, because of this he is of poor morals; from the heat he becomes cruel, fraudulent, unfaithful and full of wrath, from the moisture he is sickly, effeminate, incapable of hard work and a lover of delights: from the two, it is known, by heat and moisture, he is a glutton and libidinous" (Cardano, De la subtiliti, fol. 314v).</page><page sequence="15">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 15 des oyseaux, pourtant qu'ils ne jectent guere de semence pour la proportion du corps, &amp; pource qu'ils ont les couillons dedans le corps.28 De la subtiliti illustrates one way in which the sexual acts of birds were likened to those of humans in sixteenth-century scientific discourses--or were men likened to birds? That birds were considered to be, alongside man, the animal most driven by nature to sex promoted the tendency of bird talk to double as sexual slang in the humanistic circles where these books circulated, reinventing the old phallic currency of oiseau. This network of associations between men and birds served to situate fragments of the discourse on human sexuality in sites osten- sibly committed to cataloguing bird life. Pierre Belon's Nature des oyseaux functions in part as an explication of human reproduction through the comparison of human behavior to that of the birds it seeks to catalogue."9 Belon explains that the contemplation of questions such as how great trees sprout from tiny seeds, or how a small amount of material issuing from the entrails of an animal could engender a large mass of flesh, or how a small egg might give birth to a great bird are all worthy of attention from thoughtful men.30 So Nature des oyseaux becomes the ground for a lengthy and wandering discussion of human sexuality ranging from the description of menstrual fluid as a sort of barren semen to the use of eunuchs as lovers to the queens of Egypt. The facing plates reproduced in the following pages make amply evident the continuities Belon proposes to draw between the human body and that of birds (Fig. I).32 Belon's illustration of the parallel skeletal structures of birds and humans reveals what he considers fundamental affinities, resemblances that serve to map avian qualities onto human beings in one-to-one correspondences. Physical likenesses are spun into the fabric of natural and moral philosophy such that the instincts of birds are invested with ethical import. Indeed, both Belon and Cardano depict Nature as a benevolent overseer in a system of moral anthropomorphism common to Renaissance natural philosophers, endowing birds with human charac- teristics both physical and moral. For this reason, Belon's self-conscious 2s "Yet man among all earthly animals is the most drawn to Venus, because he is very hot and moist: he is however surpassed by birds, even though they give out little semen for the proportion of the body, and because they have the testicles inside the body" (ibid.). 29 Belon cites Aristotle as the justification and legitimization of his expose of human reproduction in chapters 3 and 4. 30 Ibid.,I3. 3~ Ibid., 41-42.</page><page sequence="16">16 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY DES OYSEAVX, PAR P.

The writtenness of printed language becomes the focus of attention as Belon sets out to commit to paper what is typically unspeakable: "By putting such things in writing, and wanting that chaste persons do not feel offended by the reading of them, we will make it so that they will not find these things in words which are inappropriate to the honesty of our language."32 In fact Belon concludes that, although the knowledge of nature's secrets is both pleasing and reputedly honneste, anyone who should utter ("pronounceroit") these secrets would be found deshonneste. In an unusual reversal, Belon's belabored reasoning concludes that printing this sexual material defuses the charged nature of oral discourse. With this disclaimer he opens the door on sexual reproduction. The discourse on human sexuality hidden within Belon's book reinforces the popular image of birds as sexually charged, and illustrates the ways in which sexual discourses had no fixed space in contemporary society. Scattered in fragments across the field of writing, from Belon's Nature des oyseaux to the chanson repertory, the discourse was itself "comme l'oiseau sur la branche"-unsettled, agitated, displaced. The opening of the chanson "Rossignol mon mignon" depicts, in just this errant state, the songbird "who goes alone from branch to branch, flying at his will, singing." Likewise, the text of"Oeil, qui mes pleurs" likens the poet's desire for his mistress to the flight of a restless bird.33 The songbird serves as a metaphor for sexual discourse itself: with few conventional literary forums, it was rarely set to the page. In Ronsard's fecund idealization of the bocage (literally, "forest clearing"), birds are the principal denizens of nature, ruled by natural sensibilities. While the language in which Ronsard describes his ideal countryside is often drawn from the literary traditions of the early sixteenth-century chanson repertory, it is enlivened by a greater richness of detail, movement, and intention. Ever springtime, the vegetation is described with active verbs; the air is full of amorous bird songs and the rustle of avian lovemaking: Je mourois de plaisir oyant les dous langages Des hupes, &amp; coqus, &amp; des ramiers rouhars 32 Ibid., 14- 33 Thomas M. Greene, in his seminal study of imitation in Renaissance poetry, reads Ronsard's metaphors of errancy as part of the discourse on imitation, drawing an interesting connection between sexual infidelity and an anti-Ciceronian poetics of imitation that uses multiple models. See The Light in Troy: Imitation and Discovery in Renaissance Poetry (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1982), I97-2 13.</page><page sequence="19">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 19 Sur le haut d'un fouteau bec en bec fretillars.34 Ronsard's birds illustrate how thoroughly Nature, as depicted in the bocage, is steeped in passion. In "Je mourois de plaisir" their sweet songs promise the love-death of sexual fulfillment. Giselle Mathieu- Castellani, in Les Themes amoureux dans la podsie franfaise (1570o- 6oo), calls Ronsardian nature "shining in its springtime like the youth of the world, entirely occupied with love. The sea makes love with the wind, the flowers offer themselves to the caresses of the sun, and the rose suffers the erotic violence of the rain, which crushes it under its ardent kisses."35 She concludes that for Ronsard, "desire itself finds its justification in cosmic forces."36 Thus the bocage emerges as the site of a truly natural-and therefore divine-state, a space far from the artificial moral constraints of court and civilization.37 The rise of a philosophy of natural love that accommodates desire represents a true turning point in the understanding of human sexuality, folding man's anthropomorphic projection of sexual desire onto birds back upon itself and making birds into models of natural morality. Lyric poetry and song, having traditionally provided the forum for the expression of love, in this way became the locus of a new ideology based on the naturalization of the human sciences that 34 Ronsard, "Je mourois de plaisir," Les Amours, 207, 11. 5-7. A translation of the full text illustrates the points made above: "I could die of pleasure seeing in these groves The trees clasped by scattered ivy, And the wild vine wandering in a thousand places Among the hawthorns blooming near the wild roses. I could die of pleasure hearing the sweet tongues Of hoopoes, &amp; cuckoos, &amp; of woodpigeons cooing In the top of a stand of beech trees, restlessly beak in beak, And of the turtledoves, too, seeing the marriages. I could die of pleasure seeing in these lovely months The roe deer venture outside the woods in the early morning, And to see the lark flit in the sky. I could die of pleasure, whereas I die of worries, Never seeing the eyes of the one whom I wish Alone, one hour in my arms in this very grove." 3s Gisele Mathieu-Castellani, Les Thcmes amoureux dans la poisie franfaise (1570- I6oo) (Paris: Klincksieck, 1975), 169; my translation. 36 Ibid. 37 Ronsard's chanson "Bon jour mon cueur" establishes the countryside as the site of his "doulce vie," and in a literal sense nature represents "the good life" far from the court at which he was forced "aller suivre le Roy, mandiant je ne sqay quoy que le vulgaire appelle une largesse" (11. I3-i5). Also see Ronsard, "La Vie loin de la cour," Les Amours, 187, and Nouvelle Continuation (1556), sonnet 18. For a study of the general trend toward idealizations of the French countryside at this time, see Jacqueline Boucher, "Vrai ou faux amour de la campagne a la cour des derniers Valois?" in Essais sur la campagne a* la renaissance: Mythes et realitis (Paris: Socidtd Frangaise des Seizidmistes, 1991), 57-72. Ronsard's most important statement on the moral quality of life at court is to be found in his Discours des miseres de ce temps (I560).</page><page sequence="20">20 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY worked to efface the conventions separating love from desire, high from low, the courtly from the carnivalesque. Ronsardian poetics imbued the bucolic imagery of the carnivalesque chanson with a sophisticated natural philosophy that expanded avian sexual meta- phors to include a conception of cosmic forces underlying the primitive desire of birds. In this dual system of celestial and terrestrial sciences combined, birds resonate with nature's true voice, making audible the harmonies of heavenly bodies and the planetary aspects they form with earth in a song that is natural through and through. Belon, in his chapter on bird songs, says: Parquoy l'homme curieux de sqavoir l'harmonie tant des corps celestes qui vivants, ne doit prendre moindre estimation d'iceux, les oyant avoir divers tons de leurs siflets, que de l'accord des corps celestes, &amp; concurrences d'iceux avec les substances terrestres.38 The planetary forces exerted on the earth through conjunctions and other heavenly gyrations are intoned in the multiple pitches of bird songs. Indeed, as Belon continues, it becomes clear that the role of birds in this Neoplatonic view of nature is that of a celestial instru- ment: Car qui vouldra prendre garde aux oyseaux, &amp; les ou'ir attentivement, recevra un parfait sentiment de la douceur de leurs chansons gratieuses, non moins armonieuses que le ronflement des nerfs d'animaux entenduz sur divers instruments de musique, ou d'un vent entonne bien delicate- ment es dulcines d'iviere.39 Birds are likened to human instruments made from the bones or tusks and "nerves" (gut) of animals, so that we are led to understand that birds, likewise, are plucked or "inspired" (in the literal sense of being blown into) by heavenly forces to produce their music. Such philosophies of bird song were not restricted to the circle of the Plkiade. Several of the anonymous chanson texts in the repertory take up notions of the ravishing effects of the nightingale's singing 38 "For this reason the man who is curious to understand the harmony of celestial and living bodies should not undervalue them (bird songs), hearing them to have a variety of tones in their whistles that accord with the celestial bodies and their conjunctions with terrestrial substances" (Belon, Nature des oyseaux, 49)- 39 "For he who would take heed of birds and listen to them attentively will receive a perfect understanding of the sweetness of their gracious songs, no less harmonious than the vibration of animal nerves heard on various musical instruments, or of a wind delicately intoned on ivory dulcians" (ibid.).</page><page sequence="21">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 21 within the context of bucolic sexual imagery. In "Un Jour m'en alloys seulette," for example, a shepherdess sings of her enchantment by the song of the wild nightingale in the woods and of how she is overcome with sleepiness. In her charmed state she is subsequently raped by a knight-errant.4o Likewise, the bird chanson best known to modem scholars, Clement Janequin's "Chant des oyseaux," commences by informing the listeners that their hearts and joy will be awakened by the marvels of bird song. The rest of the chanson imitates bird songs in music, capturing their ravishing tones in human vocalise in order to reenact their enchanting effects. In another anonymous text, "En ce beau moys," a girl and her lover passing beneath a hawthorn hear the song of two amorous nightingales and follow it with their own voices, "perfectly matched in sweet Chromatic."4' Costeley's sophisticated setting of this text for five voices employs mild chromaticism for these words, the significance of which might point to the effect of the chromatic genus, which was considered to be utterly licentious.42 Despite the pervasiveness of Neoplatonism in France at the time, I am inclined to attribute the text of "En ce beau moys" to the circle of the Pleiade and, more particularly, to Jean-Antoine de Baif's Acad6mie de poesie et de musique.43 The textual reference to the chromatic genus, even though it is not fully manifest in the music, is underscored by Neoplatonic theories of erotic ravissement associated by Ronsard with chromaticism.44 Employed in this context, the description of the 40 One wonders if Millot's unusual choice of three high voices to set this text might be related to the text's use of the feminine voice. 4' For a modern edition of this song, see Franqois Lesure, ed., Anthologie de la chanson parisienne au XVIe si'cle (Monaco: iditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre, 1953), 78-84- 42 On the licentiousness of the chromatic genus, see Ronsard's preface to Le Roy &amp; Ballard's I572 Mellange de chansons in Ronsard, Oeuvres complftes, ed. Paul Laumonier, 18 vols. (Paris: Hachette, 1914-67), 18:480-88. What I consider to be the moderate use of chromaticism in this passage might be an indication of Costeley's use of the chromatic genus as he conceived of it. Carl Dahlhaus, "Zu Costeleys chromatischer Chanson," Die Musikforschung 16 (1963): 253-65, gives an example of what he believes is a chanson by Costeley in the chromatic genus based on the use of specific hexachords. 43 "En ce beau moys" was published in Le Roy &amp; Ballard's Musique de Guillaume Costeley (1570). The print opens with two dedicatory poems to Costeley from Baif and one from Remy Belleau, another Academy member. The dedicatory poems are reprinted by Henri Expert in Guillaume Costeley, vol. 3 of Les Maitres Musiciens de la renaissance franfaise (Paris: Leduc, 1896). On the members of the Acadbmie and Costeley's participation in it, see Frances Yates, The French Academies of the Sixteenth Century (i947; reprint, London and New York: Routledge, 1988), 43- 44Ronsard's preface to Le Roy &amp; Ballard's 1572 Mellange de chansons relates that the chromatic genus was banished from the republics by the ancients because of its lasciviousness. See Ronsard, Oeuvres compl/tes, ed. Laumonier, 483-</page><page sequence="22">22 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY lovers' song as "Parfait l'accord en douce Cromatique" heightens the implication that the nightingale's song will lead to sexual abandon. Such an implication recalls the myth of Philomela, for whom the nightingale is named, seeming to turn her into a willing object of ravissement, or to merge the offender and the lamenting victim in one. Belon's Nature des oyseaux is particularly relevant to our under- standing of the place of birds in the erotic verse of the Pl6iade poets. Belon relates how in 1551 Jean Dorat, Ronsard, and others studied bird song;4s indeed, the proliferation of songbirds in Ronsard's verse alone suggests that bird-watching and -listening must have been a popular pastime at court.46 In this regard we should remember that for the Pl6iade and for French humanists in general, the study of natural philosophy formed an important part of a series of encyclo- pedic projects characterized perhaps most profoundly by the experi- ments seeking the union of poetry and music first voiced by the philosopher Pontus de Tyard and subsequently taken up by Baff's Acadimie and the later Palace Academy.47 In his Solitaire second ou 45 In book 4, chapter 26 of Nature des oyseaux, Belon recalls that in 155 1 he and "une trouppe des plus doctes, &amp; excellents poetes de ce temps" assembled at the country home of Jean Brinon at M6dan-Villaines along the Seine for several days of pastoral amusement enjoying the exotic wildlife kept there, after which they wrote "sonnets, odes, &amp; epigrammes Grecs, Latins, &amp; Frangoys" (p. 222). Only two individuals are specifically mentioned by Belon: Jean Dorat and Nicolas Denisot, though there is good reason to suppose that Ronsard (then a young poet) was among the gathering. Dorat was the older humanist around whose teaching the Pleiade was formed-at that time they still called themselves "la Brigade." Additionally, Denisot and Ronsard were good friends in these years and both shared a common patron: Brinon. It would seem that Estienne Pasquier had also become interested in bird song, which he introduced into his poetry: a letter to "Maistre Etienne Taberot des Accords" includes a poem based on the song of the nightingale. See Estienne Pasquier, Les Oeuvres d'Estienne Pasquier (Amsterdam: La Compagnie des Libraires Associez, 1723), vol. 2, letter 12. For a more comprehensive discussion of Belon's relationship with PlCiade poets, see HClene Nais, Les Animaux dans la poisie franCaise de la renaissance (Paris: Didier, I96I), I48-6o. 46 For an account of menageries at the French court in the mid-sixteenth century, see Nais, Les Animaux, 142-48. 47 Regarding the education of the Plkiade, we can suppose that the instruction Ronsard and Baif received under Dorat in the I540s undoubtedly included the medieval philosophical and scientific tradition, as well as Neoplatonic thought. On this see Yates, The French Academies, 14-15. If what we know of Ronsard's library is any indication, the sciences occupied his interests in one form or another for most of his adult life. Ronsard owned, for example, De subilitate by Cardano, Aurelii Cor. Celsi de re medica libri octo. - Q. Sereni medicinale Poema - Rhemnii Po&amp;na de Pond. et mensuris. Cum adnotationibus et correctionibus R. Constantini by Aulus Cornelius Celsus (Lyon, 1566), Theriaca et Alexipharmaca by Nicander (Cologne, 1530), and George Agricola's De re metallica (Basel, 1546). The most complete study of Ronsard's library remains Paul Laumonier, "Sur la bibliotheque de Ronsard."</page><page sequence="23">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 23 discours de la musique (i555), Tyard maintained that music was the "image of the whole Encyclopedia," encompassing both moral and natural philosophy in all their forms.48 Perhaps for this reason, the intense preoccupation of musical humanists with questions of "num- ber" and "measure"-although it has not yet been investigated thoroughly-emerges in Tyard's encyclopedia as the point of inter- section between the cosmic sciences and moral philosophies based on the musician's role in Plato's republic.49 The Nature des oyseaux resonates with the aims of Pl6iade poetics precisely through Belon's choice of the vernacular. Rejecting Latin sets his work at odds with the Aristotelian scholastic tradition that is none- theless acknowledged through numerous quotations from the Historia animalium-a text lauded for its observational method by anti-scholastic scientists as well, giving it an ambivalent status in the scholastic canon.5o Because it is written in French, Belon's construction of a vernacular ornithographic nomenclature serves to enrich the French language in much the same way as Ronsard's frequent neologisms. Belon's use of the vernacular appropriates the birds in Nature des oyseaux-ancient, mythi- cal, exotic, and common alike-for French. Ronsard, in a different but related appropriation, filled his verse with flora and fauna indigenous to France as part of his "translation" of classical poetic models into idiomatically French lyrics.5' While this late sixteenth-century interest in birds is more com- monly understood as an occupation of the elite culture of the court, the Pl6iade, and various French academies, it seems to have had more widespread manifestations as well. La Description philosophale, by virtue of its small format, poetic quatrains, and anonymity, is related to the ubiquitous recueils de poesie that collected chanson verse and other anonymous lyric poetry for popular consumption. Its moralizing tone seems to have been addressed to a public sooner bourgeois than aristocratic, and if the continuing interest in this book is any indica- tion (six editions were printed between 1561 and 1584), it found a 48 Pontus de Tyard, Solitaire second, ed.

Belon . . . , le tout enrichy de quatrains, pour plus facile cognoissance des oyseaux (I557).53 The Portraits d'oyseaux was a commercial venture on the part of the publisher, Cavellat, who cut most of the text from Belon's expansive seven-volume Nature des oyseaux and turned the emphasis to the beautiful engravings instead.54 To this picture book-probably sold with hand-colored illustrations-was added poetry: decasyllabic qua- trains encapsulating what must have seemed like the most relevant bits of information on each bird.55 Finally, in an appeal to the Italian market, the Portraits d'oyseaux adds the Italian name of each bird to the list of Greek, Latin, and French ones from Nature des oyseaux. In its popularizing combination of pictures and poetry, Portraits d'oyseaux might be considered the model for La Description philosophale. Their editorial history describes the disseminating of elitist discourses to lower, larger social strata. Current philosophies of human sexuality had always been in- scribed in the chanson repertory. One song in particular, "Quand ce beau printemps je voy," transmitted the Ronsardian philosophy of Nature to a vast public. Ronsard, leading his mistress to the bocage, points to the doves making love there. 52 These collections vary-sometimes significantly-in content, but are funda- mentally related texts: La Description philosophale . . des oyseaux (Lyon: Benoist Rigaud, 1561); La Description philosophale . . . des oyseaux (Paris: Jean Ruelle, I571); De la propriiti et nature d'aucuns oyseaux (Paris: vefve Jean Bonfons, n.d.

"See the sparrows who make love, see the doves, look at the woodpigeon, see the turtledove," the poet complains to his unyielding mistress (11. 2-4); "a little shepherdess sings of her love and the shepherd responds," but the courtly mistress is silent (11. 11-14).

Beak in beak, in a flurry of wings, they act as messengers of a new eroticism. The first print to include a musical setting of "Quand ce beau printemps je voy" was Nicolas de la Grotte's Chansons de P. de Ronsard (1569). Jean Chardavoine subsequently reprinted the monophonic melody forming the superius of La Grotte's chanson in his Recueil des plus belles et excellentes chansons of 1576, calling it a voix de ville.58ss Chardavoine's designation would seem to indicate that La Grotte's polyphonic chanson was the harmonization of a monophonic version of "Quand ce beau printemps je voy" that was part of an oral is used to distinguish and comment on unnatural (chaste) and natural (sexually active) behavior. Sometimes birds themselves take up the tune of Ronsard's philosophy, coaching amorous couples in the games of love: in the anonymous text of "Un jour l'amant &amp; l'amie," two lovers involved in "les jeux d'amour" beneath the green cover of a bush are encouraged from on high by songbirds. 58 On Chardavoine's print, see Andre Verchaly, "Le Recueil authentique des chansons de Jehan Chardavoine (1576)," Revue de musicologie 49 (1963): 203-I9; and Claude Frissard, "A propos d'un recueil de 'Chansons' de Jehan Chardavoine," Revue de musicologie 27 (1948): 58-75; facs. ed., Geneva: Minkoff, 1980.</page><page sequence="27">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 27 repertory, for in his preface to the print, Chardavoine describes the repertory he collects there as one based on popular dance tunes and "tant d'autres chansons que l'on dance et que l'on chante ordinare- ment par les villes."59 Whether or not Chardavoine's monophonic melody represents a preexistent version of the one employed by La Grotte, it seems to have been quite popular. "Quand ce beau printemps" traveled as a monophonic chanson in the contemporary traffic of anonymous chanson texts contained in recueils de poesie, its tune widely suggested as a timbre in numerous recueils.6' Table 3 lists the early prints transmitting the chanson, giving us a small measure of its popularity, which only peaked in the following decade. Char- davoine already seems to use the "Quand ce beau printemps" melody as a timbre in his Recueil of 1576, employing it to set a second, anonymous text in his collection that is fashioned after the same loping rhyme scheme, "Que ne m'a la mort tout droit" (Fig. 2). "Quand ce beau printemps je voy" was, without question, success- ful in its polyphonic setting by Nicolas de la Grotte, which was reprinted five times in the decade 1570-80 and inspired an intabula- tion for solo voice and lute by the printer himself, Adrian Le Roy. Le Roy's Livre d'airs de cour miz sur le luth is noteworthy for being the first print to use the term air de cour; he describes the pieces as a light, simple type of song previously known as voix de ville, suggesting yet again that the La Grotte chansons may indeed be harmonizations of monophonic tunes for singing strophic verse.6' La Grotte's setting of "Quand ce beau printemps je voy," for example, seems ready-made for intabulation as a solo lute song: its four voices proceed in a homorhythmic texture, declaiming the text syllabically, with the melody in the superius (Ex. i). The tonal structure is formed by a superius-bassus duet with the tenor harmonizing the superius at a sixth below; this proto-monodic style of superius melody with realized 59 On the voix de ville genre and its basis in the dance repertory, see Daniel Heartz, "Voix de ville: Between Humanist Ideals and Musical Realities," in Words and Music: The Scholar's View.

Perhaps the simplicity of this superius-oriented polyphonic style-signaled by Le Roy himself in the advertissement to the print-helps explain the subsequent independence of the mono- phonic melody. Or, conversely, perhaps it confirms that La Grotte was working with a preexistent, orally transmitted air (a supposition that is supported by the variants among the versions given in Figure i and Example i, and the internal musical repetition characteristic of improvisatory formulae evident in all three versions). Either way, the print history of La Grotte's chansons provides a remarkable example of polyphonic chansons that shed their music, circulating first as monophonic melodies and finally as airs or timbres in the repertory of recueils de poesie (see Table 4). The fact that "Quand ce beau printemps je voy" was well known in a monophonic version transmitted by Chardavoine points to a popular success among a wide audience: this tune had enough currency to be used in recueils de poesie as the timbre for contrafacta texts with no need to include the music, so that, as Chardavoine advertises in his preface, "everyone can sing [it] wherever they might find themselves, with the voice as easily as with instruments." The popularity that "Quand ce beau printemps je voy" enjoyed in recueils de poisie we may wish to attribute to the wider public addressed by the recueils, a public not circumscribed by advanced musical literacy and that extended beyond the courtly and aristocratic one that we have come to associate with the polyphonic repertory.

This particular audience, typically referred to as nouveaux nobles, was characterized by an ideology of labor that distinguished its tastes and moral stance from the traditional courtly embrace of pleasure. But in an environment where attitudes of nobility helped define social position, the value newly placed on work clashed with the leisure deeply ingrained in the lifestyle of the aristocracy. Long an important aristocratic pastime, music making was now viewed with ambivalence by these "new nobles" who questioned its moral value even as they sought to place it in their revised formulations of noble comportment. The defining proclivities of this class contributed to the shape of a sexual discourse in which the chanson had become enmeshed. The tension between morality and eroticism can be located through two different modes of inquiry: the first considers how chanson prints were addressed to members of this class, and the second describes a reception history of the chanson within it. These modes work to excavate meaning from the publisher's side, from which chanson prints were directed to specific publics, and from the audience's side, where the chanson was received. In the first case, we shall see how Le Roy &amp; Ballard seem to have expressly catered to the tastes of the nouveaux nobles in the Livre d'airs de cour miz sur le luth. In the second, the reception of the chanson among the nouveaux nobles, as voiced in contemporary treatises on noble behavior, suggests that the fear of sexual depravity organized their attitudes toward chanson singing. Oisivet6 and the Nouveaux Nobles In the late sixteenth century, the social order in France was suffering a shift in fiscal power away from the increasingly impover- ished old aristocracy to a class of nouveaux nobles to whom the monarchy sold noble titles.63 These new nobles, with wealth acquired Natalie Zemon Davis, "Printing and the People," in Society and Culture in Early Modern France (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1975), 192-93- 63 Some of the best general studies of the social and financial position of this new nobiliary class include George Huppert, Les Bourgeois Gentilshommes (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1977); Davis Bitton, The French Nobility in Crisis, 156o-164o (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1969); Jean-Richard Bloch, L 'Anoblissement en France au temps de Francois Ier (Paris: F.

Meanwhile, many aristocrats came to be not only financially disempowered (there are stories of such gentlemen being forced to work in the shops of artisans),64 but the target of social derision on the part of the new nobility, which valued the humanistic educational program of France's colleges above a traditional education in the military arts.65 In short, the social hierarchy in France in the second half of the sixteenth century was overturned by money itself as the monarchy came to pay its war debt to bourgeois, merchants, and bankers through the selling of noble offices, thereby inciting the social ascent of the recently monied.66 Nobility had always been defined largely in terms of retirement from commercial activity. In fact, noble titles were originally granted only to those families who could document having "lived nobly" (that is, refrained from commerce) for three generations.6' Thus noble life involved a certain amount of free time. Michel de Montaigne, one of the class of nouveaux nobles, professed to have retreated to the library in his tower for days of contemplation. Although Montaigne does not seem to have been an amateur musician himself, the place of music as an important part of the cultivation of nobility is clear both in the in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986); and James Supple, Arms Versus Letters: The Military and Literary Ideals in the "Essais" of Montaigne. 64 Philippe Desan, Les Commerces de Montaigne: Le Discours 6conomique des Essais (Paris: Nizet, 1992), 39. 65s The educational program of Petrus Ramus (Pierre de la Ramee) probably best describes the type of "useful" humanistic education that was geared to the members of a mercantile class who were determined to get value for their money "invested" in their sons' education.

Adrian Le Roy's print of airs de cour seems specifically destined for the public of aspiring nobles, for its title transforms the urban associations of the voix de ville into something more courtly while yet maintaining the music's idiomatic simplicity to attract the amateur. Certainly one can conclude that in the social discourse of the nouveaux nobles, the chanson had a role to play.70 The picture we fashion of noble life, then, seems to be one in which the function of music is quite similar to its use at court, a scenario in which the homes of nouveaux nobles were formed as distant 68 Michel de Montaigne, Essais 1:26. See also Rabelais, Gargantua, chap. 23. My thanks to Professor Leeman Perkins for pointing out to me the passage on Montaigne's own "musical education" related in the introduction to the Essais, p. xviii: "De peur d'arracher trop brusquement Michel au sommeil, il [his father] le faisait eveiller en musique; et il eut toujours au service de l'enfant un joueur d'epinette pour cet effet." 69 The French music treatises of the 1570s listed in Ake Davidsson, Bibliographie der musiktheoretischen Drucke des i6. Jahrhunderts (Baden-Baden: Verlag Heitz GmbH, 1962), include Corneille de Montfort Blockland, Instruction de musique (Lyons: Jean de Tournes, 1573), which contains twenty-two four-voice chansons used as examples and twelve monophonic chansons; Pierre Julien, Le Vrai Chemin pour apprendre ai chanter toute sorte de musique (Lyons, 1570); Anonymous, La Main harmonique, ou les principes de musique antique et moderne, et les propriftis que la moderne refoit de sept planettes (Paris: Nicolas du Chemin, i571), of which there is no known exemplar; Adrien Le Roy, Insruction de partir toute musique des huit divers tons, en tablature de luth (Paris, 1557, 1576), which intabulates eleven chansons by Lassus, one by Arcadelt, and three for which no composer is identifed; Michel de Menehou, Nouvelle Instruction contenant en brief les priceptes, ou fondements de musique tant pleine que figurie (Paris: Nicolas du Chemin, 1558, i571), which uses polyphonic examples without texts or incipits and prints a chanson in choirbook format at the end, "Le Souvenir de madame jolie." 70 Jeanice Brooks offers an excellent example of just such a nouveau noble who cultivated music as part of his new lifestyle, in her article "Jean de Castro, the Pense Partbooks and Musical Culture in Sixteenth-Century Lyons," Early Music History i i (1992): 91-149. These beautiful partbooks were commissioned by Justinien Pense, a member of one of the most important Lyonnais merchant families engaged in the textile trade with Antwerp. The chansons they collect include settings by Castro of Pense's own texts, evidence that he was an avid connoisseur of the chanson. See especially Brooks's archival research that illustrates how Pense styled himself as noble by using the business's profits to buy land at the Seigneurie de Ste-Croix, giving himself the title "noble Justinien Pense, gentilhomme ordinaire de la maison du roi et seigneur de Sainte-Croix" (p. 129).</page><page sequence="34">34 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY reflections of the court of the Valois. But this does not account for all the meanings surrounding the pastime of music making: what is clear in Montaigne and demonstrable in the chanson repertory is that the nouveaux nobles harbored an ambivalence toward leisure. Tied to their bourgeois roots, they espoused an ideology of labor that ultimately replaced the older, more courtly ideology based upon idleness and pleasure.7' In the meantime, the problem of how the virtuous might pass the time with "honest" activities-neither laborious nor too pleasurable-remained to be resolved. This ambivalence toward leisure is manifest in Montaigne's essay "De l'oisivet6," in which he recounts the dangers of oisivet6, or idleness-paradoxically the very same leisure that he sought as he withdrew to his tower. This essay continually uses reproductive images to illustrate idleness's evils: idle land, though fertile, will produce wild and useless plants, and idle women conceive "masses and pieces of unformed flesh" unless impregnated with the male seed.72 The obvious subtext of Montaigne's essay "De l'oisivet6" is that idleness generates disorder, monstrosities. And further, that this degenerate behavior is linked to reproductive and sexual acts. In chansons of the I570s, the connection of idleness with the wanton sexuality of young ladies (damoiselles) is quite clear. One example among many is Ronsard's "Mignonne leves-vous," part of a whole subgenre of "levez-vous" chansons popular at the time. Mignonne, lev6s-vous, vous estes paresseuse, Ja la gaye alouette au ciel a fredonne6, Et ja le rossignol frisquement jargonne, Dessus l'espine assis, sa complainte amoureuse. 7' Hugo Friedrich, Montaigne, ed. Philippe Desan, trans. Dawn Eng (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 199 1), xiv. Desan gives as one example of this "mercantilist and exchange" ideology the common attitude at the time that the French language was impoverished, but could be enriched "through the slow and laborious accumulation of new words and expressions within the lexicon." Thus the accumulation of linguistic capital helps form the basis of intellectual wealth. This thesis underpins Desan's Les Commerces de Montaigne as well as his most recent monograph, L'Imaginaire iconomique de la Renaissance (Paris: Jditions InterUniversi- taires, 1993). A musical parallel, Antoine de Bertrand's project to enrich the contemporary musical lexicon through the use of the chromatic and enharmonic genera, is similarly cast in terms of "travaille," "dilligence," "un laborieux &amp; long estude," and so on in the preface to his Premier Livre des amours of 1576. 72 Montaigne, Essais 1:8, 33-34-</page><page sequence="35">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 35 Ian, je vous punirai du pech6 de paresse, Je vois baiser cent fois vostre oeil, vostre tetin, Afin de vous aprendre a vous lever matin. (11. 1-4, I2-14)73 In this song, the poet's mignonne is punished for her paresse or laziness by sexual titillation. Indeed, her laziness in bed culminates in erotic adventure. Montaigne argues that oisiveti brings on a state of restless- ness and aimlessness. Like the "oiseau sur la branche," the idle spirit "loses itself: for, as they say, it is not in one place, but everywhere."74 In the sixteenth century, the word damoiselle referred principally to a woman of "petite noblesse": above a woman of the bourgeoisie and yet below the most noble dames. In the word damoiselle, we find the intersection of these ideas: the class of the "petits nobles" (damoiselle), oisiveti in its feminine adjectival form (oiselle), and the feminine form of oiseau (oiselle). On what level could women of this class have been likened to birds? The damoiselle was in a state of perpetual movement, aspiring to nobility on an upward-bound social path. Unmarried, not yet fixed to one man, she was "comme l'oiseau sur la branche," unsettled, looking for a mate. In another formulation contrasting noble behavior with the negative quality of oisiveti by juxtaposing two meanings of oyseaux, La Description philosophale relates that the night- ingale is the most noble of all the little birds (oyseaux) and not naturally lazy (oyseaux): "C'est le plus noble de tous les petiz oyseaux, &amp; n'est oyseaux de son naturel: car il chante incessament tout la nuict sans dormir."75 Perhaps, then, it is not mere lexical fortune that the ideas of unrestrained sexuality represented by oiseaux, the dangerous idle- ness of oisiveti, and the associations with petite noblesse all merge in the word damoiselle.76 Like Ronsard's mignonne, the damoiselle was often a woman fallen prey to the oisiveti of her class and in danger of licentiousness. 73 "Little one, get up, you are lazy, Already the gay lark is singing in the sky, And the nightingale gracefully sings Its amorous plaint sitting under the pine.... Yes, I will punish you for the sin of laziness, I'm going to kiss your eyes, your breasts, a hundred times To finally teach you to get up in the morning." 74 Montaigne, Essais 1:8, 33- 75 La Description philosophale, fol. 16v. 7' The word damoiselle was derived from the Latin domnicella; its etymology does not connect it to oiseau or oisiveti. Nevertheless, sixteenth-century writers seem to have been very conscious of the way in which "oiselle" and "dames" are linked in this word. I offer but two examples. In the scenes on the bird-filled "Isle Sonante" (Le Cinquiesme Livre ... Pantagruel, chaps. 1-6), Rabelais consistently uses a hyphenated form of the word-"dame-oiselle"-to mean "bird-lady" or "idle-lady." Marot, too, plays on the adjectival "oiselle" in damoiselle in poems such as "Aux Damoyselles paresseuses, d'escrire a leurs amys."</page><page sequence="36">36 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY We do not usually stress this median class of gentry as consumers of a repertory typically taken to be courtly, but there is evidence that it had become a significant public for the chanson. Not only did the nouveaux nobles possess the money to purchase chanson prints, but the changing complexion of the chansons printed by Le Roy &amp; Ballard during the latter third of the sixteenth century reflects their new concerns. This is readily apparent in the simpler musical style advertised by Adrian Le Roy in the preface to the Livre d'airs de cour miz sur le luth, and in the new generic label he introduces there. His renaming of the voix de ville describes a different origin for these tunes, relocating them from the city (voix de ville) to the court (air de cour), conferring nobility upon these common melodies. The new nobility sought to create an aristocratic heritage for itself, professing a nostalgic yearning for a courtly past in which it never participated. Surrounding themselves with noble accoutrements and fictionalizing their heritage perforce, the nouveaux nobles were re- sponding to the cloying proximity of their too-recent commercial backgrounds. They worked to distance themselves from their bour- geois roots, hardening the class lines through legal means, treatises on nobility, and sumptuary laws: the profusion of literature and laws codifying "la vie noble" only belies the fragility of contemporary distinctions between nobleman and bourgeois. Adrian Le Roy, the driving force behind the firm of Le Roy &amp; Ballard, held the legal status of "bourgeois de Paris" and apparently owed his success in part to his willingness to accommodate the tastes of this growing class of consumers.77 The suppression of the designation voix de ville in Le Roy's Livre d'airs de cour miz sur le luth is significant in that the epithet "ville" bore an extremely derogatory connotation when applied to questions of noblity. As Estienne Pasquier explains, since the owner- ship of a fief had so long defined the class of old aristocratic nobility, a country residence contributed greatly to noble status.78 Unlanded gentry with noble aspiration-those who "lived softly in the cities, in delight and leisure"-were called "villains" by the landed nobility to distinguish them from "true" gentlemen. "Gentil-homme de ville" was an appellation of ridicule and mockery, as Pasquier reminds his readers. Le Roy's airs de cour repackages the accessible voix de ville with a title that would appeal to-rather than offend-a public of nouveaux nobles. 77 Franqois Lesure and Genevieve Thibault, Bibliographie des iditions d'Adrian Le Roy et Robert Ballard (i55I-I598) (Paris: Soci6t6 Franqaise de Musicologie, i955), I2. 78 Pasquier, Les Oeuvres d'Estienne Pasquier I:I35-</page><page sequence="37">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 37 The moral certitude of the gentry, and its suspicion of oisiveti, surfaces in texts engaging the sexual discourses located in the chanson repertory. Their critiques of chanson evince a characteristically repressive reaction to the pervasive language of sexual liberty con- veyed in songs like "Quand ce beau printemps je voy." Indeed, it is as if they sought to cultivate the moral-but fictional-high road of courtly unrequited love while attempting to repudiate the carni- valesque sexual underworld that is part and parcel of it. Or, in reaction to the newer, Ronsardian formulation, it is as if they would engage the beneficent Neoplatonic effects of music said to enhance the morality of Plato's citizens without risking musical ravissement. We might here recall that Plato's own ambivalence toward music's moral effects led him to be very discriminating in his musical recommendations.79 In this respect, the skepticism of the nouveaux nobles is hardly new. What distinguishes their attitude toward chanson is the intersection of this moral doubt with the overall suspicion, ingrained in the bourgeoisie, of idle courtly pleasures. Michel Foucault, in The History of Sexuality, links the rise of sexual repression at this time with the empowerment of the bourgeoisie.s8 As part of this repressiveness, he proposes, it had first been necessary "to subjugate [sexuality] at the level of language, control its free circula- tion in speech, expunge it from the things that were said, and extinguish the words that rendered it too visibly present."8' Ever watchful of repressive regimes, Foucault sees these new rules of propriety as the means by which speech came to be policed. Yet at the same time, argues Foucault, this repressive tendency resulted para- doxically in the incitement to discourse: "around and apropos of sex, one sees a veritable discursive explosion.""8 It is at the level of so-called discursive formations that Foucault develops his history of 79 See especially The Republic, trans.

The most obscene recueils sometimes suppressed even the publisher's name, the height of anonymity; even Ronsard felt constrained to publish his carnivalesque Les Foldstries anonymously.85 The tiny physical format of chanson prints and recueils de poesie also seemed to contribute to their free and anonymous circulation. When they were bound for preservation, they tended to be grouped together in a milange or inserted amongst works of other genres and thereby hidden.86 The licentiousness of the chanson repertory was hardly a secret, however. It caused some consternation among writers on nobility who recommended music as an appropriate pastime for those aspiring to noble lifestyles. Traditionally situated among the classical liberal arts, music was invariably indicated as a necessary part of the humanistic education that contributed so greatly to noble affect. Yet many authors felt obliged to signal to their public the dangers of chanson despite the 83 Ibid., 67-73- 84 In two related articles, Michel Simonin tries to reconstruct what might have constituted a late sixteenth-century French ars erotica using chanson texts, confes- sional manuals, and medicinals that recommend the reading of erotic literature as therapy for certain disorders.

One younger friend and admirer of Montaigne, Antoine Math6 de Laval, struggled with the volubility of music's meanings in his treatise on noble life, Desseins de professions nobles.87 Having counseled his readers to study music, Laval then qualifies his advice, oscillating between proscription and prescription. Referring to music as "this Circe," he confesses that "it is so suspect to me that I do not dare to advise its use nor that of poetry to young people who want to employ themselves at one of the professions useful to the service of the public." Then, in a typically Montaignesque reversal, Laval proceeds, in the very next line, to place music among "the most elevated and sublime of the liberal, noble, and honorable Arts."88 But the rhetoric against music and poetry (and here he must be talking about chanson for he refers to "ces Syrenes de jeu de Luth, de Musique &amp; de vers") seems to win out. Laval's vilification of the lyric arts as Sirens draws upon a bird myth that tells of music's sensual and deadly potential, for "the Sirens are little birds, having a face like a woman, who sing very melodiously: but the single end of their music's sensuality is death."'9 Half human, half bird, the Sirens embody the damoiselle's allure in their enchanting song. Al- though Laval acknowledges that the lyric arts can "elevate the spirit," he is quick to identify the risky moral decline that the pleasure of such ravissement entails: Mais le chatoiiillement &amp; le transport y est si grand qu'a qui ne prend garde a se roydir contre ces Ministres de volupte, ils vous troussent court un homme &amp; l'emportent tout entier, croupir au sein de la faineantise &amp; de l'oysiviet6.90 Despite his colloquial language, Laval's warning against the destruc- tive potential of chanson is cast in terms reminiscent of Tyard's Neoplatonism. Yet what is, for the courtly Tyard, an upward spiritual 87 Antoine Mathe de Laval, Desseins de professions nobles et publiques (Paris: Abel l'Angelier, 1605). On Laval's friendship with Montaigne, see Mario Schiff, La Fille d'alliance de Montaigne, Mademoiselle de Gournay (Paris: Champion, 1910), 130. 88 "Ceste Circe m'est si suspecte que je n'ose en conseiller l'usage non plus que de la Poesie h la jeunesse qui veut s'employer i quelqu'une des Professions utiles a servir le public" (ibid., fol. 5r). 89 Pontus de Tyard, Solitaire premier, ed. Silvio Baridon (Geneva: Droz, 1950): "Les Sirenes sont petits oiseaux, ayans la face comme une femme, qui chantent fort melodieusement: mais l'unique fin de la volupt6 de leur musique, est la mort" (p. 52). 90 "But the tickling &amp; the transport there is so great that for he who does not take care to harden himself against these ministers of sensual delight, they will quickly truss up a man &amp; carry him off whole, to stagnate his breast with laziness and idleness" (fol. 5v).</page><page sequence="40">40 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY transport of the listener begun by the incursion of the fureur poFtique becomes, in Laval's world view, a somewhat diabolic ravishing of the victim's soul. The ambivalence that Laval evinces toward the chanson is em- blematic of an author's struggle to accommodate an older, aristocratic art form that arose from a society espousing an ideology of leisure to a newer, bourgeois conception of noble life with a vastly different ideological heritage. The nouveau noble ideology of labor strikes an uneasy balance with the chanson: at the same time authors like Laval suggest the cultivation of music as part of a humanistic education, and publishers like Adrian Le Roy are supplying amateurs with "chansons ... beaucoup plus legieres," the moral value of song is deeply suspect. Ostensibly, chanson singing was a means by which to pass leisure time without falling into idleness. Such titles as Recueil de tout soulas et plaisir pour re~souir et passer temps, La Ricriation et passetemps des tristes, or L'Amoureux passetemps make their intentions clear.9' While chan- sons and recueils de poisie were thus seen as an honest occupation to avert the sexual abandon that might arise during idle hours, musical pastimes could dangerously invite lascivious behavior through the new eroticism encoded in popular texts like "Quand ce beau printemps je voy," through carnivalesque imagery, and through the sensual "tick- ling and transport" of the music itself. Couched in terms of the songbird, the ideological strands shot through the chanson draw together in a topos that is at once courtly, popular, sexual, and musical. The University of Chicago ABSTRACT Chanson texts featuring birds form a unique nexus of voices in the sexual discourse pervading the Parisian repertory of the late sixteenth century. The eroticism of these chansons is often expressed according to the older poetic conventions of unrequited courtly love and its carnivalesque abasement focusing on the lower body, or by a synthesis of the two characterized by the poetry of Pierre de Ronsard. Ronsard's sensual lyricism tended to employ avian imagery in support of a naturalized philosophy of love encouraging sexuality. Birds, considered to have a libido surpassing that of humans, became a favored theme, and composers set many of these Ronsardian texts. In the second part of this essay, I contextualize the reception of the erotic Nevertheless, the prefatory poem of La R"cr ation, "Aux Dames," warns: "Beware of touching this book (my ladies), it speaks of love."</page><page sequence="41">A LIBIDINOUS AVIARY 41 chanson among France's upper classes, relating it to the crisis of the French aristocracy and the noble aspirations of the bourgeoisie. The nouveaux nobles, or bourgeois that ennobled themselves with the purchase of seigneurial titles, had the fiscal power to acquire music and seem to have evinced the same sexual repression that Foucault saw as emblematic of bourgeois society itself-a repression that spawned a whole literature on sex. Around and in the chanson formed a rich locus of this contemporary discourse on sex, noble comportment, and the moral effects of music.</page></plain_text>
