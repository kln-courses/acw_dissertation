<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYLONOPOULOS (J.) Ed. Divine Images and Human Imaginations in Ancient Greece and Rome (Religions in the Graeco-Roman World 170). Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2010. Pp. xvi + 437, illus. €135/$200. 9789004179301. doi: 10. 1017/S0075426911000814 The outcome of a conference held at the University of Erfurt in 2007, this volume brings together a stellar cast of scholars who work at the interface between religion and material culture, from Minoan and Mycenaean iconography (F. Blakolmer) right through to the reception of Greek religious statuary in Christian Constantinople (A. Bravi). While recent schol- arship on sacred images by A.A. Donohue, T. Scheer and S. Bettinetti has done much to elucidate problems relating to the terminology of so-called 'cult statues' in Greek texts, Divine Images and Human Imaginations attempts to move the debate forward, bringing this philo- logical work into conversation with both objects themselves and broader themes relating to the religious and political significance of images in Greek and Roman cult. Published entirely in English, the volume offers Anglo-American scholars less familiar with work on the Continent the chance to survey a range of approaches and methodologies, and is thus particularly useful for those teaching students without French or German. It is especially gratifying to see the work of F. Hölscher, V. Pirenne-Delforge and T. Scheer available in English, each of whom has done so much to advance our understanding of the archaeology and aesthetics of the sacred; it certainly makes up for occasional infelicities in translation (the volume would have benefitted from a final copy-edit). As Mylonopoulos points out in his brief but helpful introduction, modern distinctions between 'cult' and 'votive' images in antiquity are methodologically problematic. Rather than making a doomed attempt to settle this tired debate, the volume explores how statues conven- tionally identified as the focus of cultic activity relate to broader practices of visualizing and worshipping the divine. Thus M. Gaifman offers an important corrective to scholarly assumptions about the dominance of anthropomorphic depic- tions of the gods by emphasizing the role played by aniconic objects in Greek image-worship, while Pirenne-Delforge offers an innovative (and much needed) analysis of parallels between the ways in which priests and cult statues mediated</page><page sequence="2">ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY 257 between communities and their gods, demon- strating the high degree of instrumental and ontological correspondence between cultic performances and material representations. The relationship between votive images and the deities to whom they are dedicated is addressed by C. Keesling, who reopens the question (explored in her 2003 book, The Votive Statues of the Athenian Acropolis) of the identity of kore statues, reiterating her thesis that, in certain key locations (such as Athens and Cyprus), they should be understood as goddesses rather than generic attendants or cultic personnel. In a partic- ularly illuminating paper, S. Estienne confronts the relationship between cult and votive images in Roman contexts; here she suggests that the distinction drawn in Latin between simulacra deorum and ornamenta aedium offers a means of differentiating between inalienable images acting as the focus of worship (often associated with the foundation of a cult) and objects treated as supplementary (and therefore alienable) posses- sions. In this sense, Roman legal texts provide a degree of precision that is not necessarily found in Greek contexts; it would have been fascinating to learn more about how and why this might be the case. Indeed, the volume's inclusion of Roman attitudes to sacred images is particularly welcome. Two of the strongest papers are Scheer's account of the removal of the statue of Athena Alea from Tegea by Augustus and its installation at the entrance to his Forum (which weaves together an analysis of the statue's role within Arcadian religion and politics with a subtle interpretation of its relative status and newly acquired connotations at Rome) and D. Steuernagel 's examination of the shifting ways in which statues of the imperial family were displayed in Greek temples. The latter gives an elegant account of the means by which potentially conflicting models of divine power were placed in dialogue with each other, to the benefit of both local and imperial élites. While several papers offer more traditional analyses of cultic iconography (such as G. Ekroth's interpretation of a well-known but problematic Athenian relief dedicated to Theseus, which she relates to the Horkomosion , where oaths were taken in the Archaic Agora), the volume's most methodologically nuanced contri- butions are concerned with the reception and afterlife of divine images. Gaifman's piece, for example, not only dismantles the ideological agendas behind attitudes to aniconism in schol- arship from Winckelmann to M.R Nilsson, but also demonstrates through close readings of authors such as Pausanias how aniconic objects did not function as a single category. Indeed, they served a variety of purposes both in the context of cult and in later Greek discourse on the materi- ality of the sacred. Likewise, I. Petrovic gives a delightfully sophisticated reading of Callimachus' Seventh Iambus , in which the speaking form of Hermes Perpheraios offers a commentary on Hellenistic attitudes to statues of miraculous origin, whilst functioning as the voice of Archaic Iambus itself. The text thus yokes Callimachus' interest in the representational complexities of sacred images (as explored elsewhere in his poetry) to his concern with the poetics of genre. One hopes that the presence of this paper in a volume otherwise focused on material culture will not prevent scholars from reading it as a pendant to Petrovic's equally illuminating piece on the role of the Pheidian Zeus in Callimachus' Sixth Iambus ('Delusions of grandeur: Homer, Zeus and the Telchines in Callimachus' reply (Aida Fr. 1) and Iambus 6', Antike und Abendland 52 (2006) 16-41). Ultimately, the range of scholarly approaches and varied interests of its contributors constitute this book's strength and its weakness. Like so many edited volumes, it brings together an impressive cast and raises many important (and importantly different) questions, yet leaves it up to the reader to find coherence within its loosely chronological structure. Although each paper is accompanied by relevant pictures, the reader will not find much here on the framing or archaeo- logical context of divine images, nor reflections on style, medium or issues of representation. The focus is not so much on the actual visual work that such images did in constructing 'human imaginations' of the gods (with the exception, perhaps, of Mylonopoulos' own contribution, on divine attributes), which makes the volume's title somewhat misleading. Rather, we find an interest in the instrumentality or ritual function of divine images, their broader political significance and their literary reception. Nevertheless, the collection offers a number of welcome ways forward for a field that has until recently suffered from methodological aporia; if it is a foretaste of things to come, then we are fortunate indeed.
