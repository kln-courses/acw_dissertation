<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOUCH-THE NEGLECTED SENSE An Inquiry into the Reasons for our Comparative Failure to Create and Enjoy Tactile Art Forms FRANCES W. HERRING Are there compelling reasons, aesthetic or psychological, for the virtual absence in Western countries of an art form which appeals primarily to the sense of touch? Or do we in America and Europe share a kind of cultural poverty in this regard, brought about by aesthetically irrelevant circumstances and attitudes? Whatever the reasons, there can be little doubt of the fact that touch is re- garded as an unimportant sense by most Occidental writers on aesthetic theory. The usual view is that, along with taste and smell, touch is unsuited to serve as the basis of an art form or of aesthetic experience. Consult the index of any book on art, whether written from a psychological, logical, technical or philo- sophical viewpoint, and the likelihood is that you will find touch not even men- tioned in the index. A sentence or two in the text will suffice to dismiss the subject. Visit any art museum in America; the likelihood is that you will find</page><page sequence="2">200 FRANCES W. HERRING exhibits of beautiful objects locked securely behind glass, and prominent signs, "Please Do Not Touch", displayed in proximity to every tempting textile, pot- tery or piece of sculpture. This state of affairs has come to seem to the writer so remarkable that it has provoked a prolonged examination of the literature of the subject, as well as many talks with artists and others, with a view to discovering why it exists. Among writers on aesthetics some, one finds, hold disparaging opinions about the sense of touch, considered as an avenue of artistic experience. They state with conviction and finality that touch, taste and smell are lower senses, less honorific in a Platonic moral sense, than vision and hearing. But for the ma- jority of theorists, it seems rather to be the case that, having noted painting, sculpture, music, literature, drama and the dance to be the chief art forms of Europe and America, they find it correct to ignore the sense of touch, to which no art form uniquely corresponds, as obviously (though not invidiously) ir- relevant to the subject at hand. Some writers, however, justify briefly their rather summary treatment of the subject, and these statements have been culled and carefully considered. The reasons advanced for regarding the sense of touch as non-aesthetic may without strain be classified as variants of three main argu- ments which may be styled the psychological, the technical and the philosophical arguments, which will be here recapitulated. I. The Psychological Argument. Touch, like taste and smell, is predominantly utilitarian in function. In touching an object, our reactions are instinctively practical and instrumental, leading to further bodily activity of an interested sort. This is sometimes expressed as the fact that toward touch data it is almost impossible to maintain psychological distance-the degree of detachment neces- sary to the aesthetic reaction. DeWitt Parker (Analysis of Art, p. 45) expresses this objection as follows: The object of touch, and of taste ... has to be brought into contact with the body; the practical reaction then follows; there is no time during which it may be suspended. And Irwin Edman (The World, the Arts and the Artist, p. 24) puts it this way: The other senses too have their possible aesthetic exploitation, but touch, taste and smell are not as finely manipulable, not as easily incorporated in objects or detached from practi- cal biological interests as are sight and sound. This judgment is, of course, as old as the Greeks, although it is usually ad- vanced today for other than the moral reasons adduced by Plato and Aristotle. It is also close to that of Aquinas (Summa Theologica): Those senses are most concerned with beauty which are most concerned in apprehension, namely the sight and hearing, which ministers to reason. For we speak of beautiful sights and sounds but do not give the name of beauty to the objects of other senses, such as tastes or smells . . . what simply satisfies desire is called good, but that whose very apprehension pleases is called beautiful. Modern opinion supporting this view is even more closely related, perhaps, to that of Schopenhauer (The World as Will and Idea), who graded the senses in a</page><page sequence="3">TOUCH-THE NEGLECTED SENSE 201 scale of aesthetic fitness according as they were closely or remotely related to the will: Sight, unlike the affections of the other senses, cannot, in itself, directly and through its sensuous effect, make the sensation of the special organ agreeable or disagreeable; that is, it has no immediate connexion with the will. In the case of hearing, this is to some extent otherwise; sounds can give pain directly, and they may also be sensuously agreeable directly and without regard to harmony or melody. Touch, as one with the feeling of the whole body, is still more subordinated to this direct influence upon the will; and yet there is such a thing as a sensation of touch which is neither painful nor pleasant. But smells are always either agreeable or disagreeable, and tastes still more so. Thus the last two senses are most closely related to the will-therefore they are always the most ignoble. Many other illustrations of this argument could be quoted, for there is a long and weighty tradition behind the view that the psychological difficulty of divorc- ing the senses of touch, taste and smell from their utilitarian functions is virtually insurmountable. We should note here one other point of view which seems to fall within the category of psychological, or perhaps of a sociological, argument. D. W. Got- shalk, whose new book, Art and the Social Order, follows DeWitt Parker to a large extent in his analysis of this particular problem, adds what he calls an "artificial" reason to Parker's "natural" ones explaining why sight and hearing are aesthetically superior to the other three senses, i.e. (p. 89): that sight and hearing are the customary everyday sensory channels of expression and communication . . . smell and touch, and taste, too, are not the most usual sensory channels of public expression and communication in human life. Sight and hearing are. We express and communicate publicly by writing, pointing, speaking, gesticulating-by visual and auditory signs-and other signs are usually ancillary to these. Possibly major fine arts can be developed which appeal primarily to taste, touch, or smell. These senses have con- siderable potentialities as avenues of aesthetic perception. But at present they are aes- thetically inferior to sight and hearing ... and under existing circumstances the appeal of the materials of art primarily to sight and hearing is therefore inevitable in view of the differential character of fine art. While Gotshalk here grants a deal more than other writers so far quoted as to the possible future development of tactile art, he seems to conclude that existing difficulties are not likely to be overcome because of firmly established psycho- logical habits. II. The Technical Argument. There are no intrinsic principles of order in tactile sensations. They do not readily lend themselves to scalar arrangements of any sort. In fact, the fine discrimination required to distinguish one quality from another is rarely found in people. Only the blind have developed a lan- guage of touch. Yet, without such ordering principles, the necessary control of the medium is lacking. The aesthetic experience, even though genuine, must remain private. It cannot be communicated to others, given a dependable public character. This explanation of the case appears more and more frequently from the 19th century on. One or two quotations may be in order. Aram Torossian (A Guide to Aesthetics, 1937) says: Works of art are visual or auditory objects simply because, as we have seen, their creation from olfactory, gustatory, or tactile sense-matter alone is extremely difficult if not im-</page><page sequence="4">202 FRANCES W. HERRING possible. (p. 37) ... because the pattern involved in them cannot be made sufficiently complex to satisfy the shifting nature of our perception, not to mention also the difficulty of making the pattern sufficiently definite and permanent to be contemplated by others be- sides the creator himself. It is not easy to control the intensity, duration, mixture, and relationships of odors and tastes in order to convey the same or nearly the same impressions to different persons. I have found no case in which such an experiment has been tried with tactual sense-matter alone. (pp. 33-34). DeWitt Parker, quoted above, agrees on this point (p. 45): From the time of Plato, who writes of 'fair sights and sounds' only, vision and hearing have been recognized as the preeminently aesthetic senses.... And there are good reasons for their special fitness.... Important ... is our greater power to control sensations of vision and hearing. Only colors, lines and sounds can be woven into complex and stable wholes. III. The Philosophical Argument. Touch, unlike sight and hearing, is in- capable of expressing the larger and deeper life experiences; of expressing values. Even when this view is not explicitly stated, it is the clear implication of the definition or analysis of aesthetic experience, taken with the failure to include tactile experiences as possible sources of aesthetic emotion or appreciation. "Significance," "expressiveness," the argument goes, are not easily conveyed or realized through touch. To quote Parker once more (p. 46): Nevertheless, the possibility of controlling colors and sounds and of creating stable and public objects out of them, is only a secondary reason for their aesthetic fitness.... The fundamental reason for the superiority of sights and sounds remains the possibility of communicating the larger and deeper life of feeling and thought through them. These are three powerful arguments indeed, and should they prove unshakable, would be sufficient to account for the neglect which tactile experiences have cus- tomarily received at the hands of most aesthetic theorists, artists and the ap- preciative public in the countries of the West. Before we venture upon an analysis of these arguments, however, let us ob- serve that in rather recent times voices have been raised in question of these views. Beginning with Bernard Bosanquet, whose emphasis on the importance of the medium in determining art form perhaps naturally led him to recognize tactile qualities as significant', a growing chorus of artists and thinkers have testified to the aesthetic reality and possible significance of tactile experiences. Bosanquet gives to touch a tempered and qualified recognition, to be sure (Proceedings of Aristotelian Society, Vol. I, No. 3, Part II, p. 98): Witness the following passage: "You cannot make the same things in clay as you can in wrought-iron, except by a tour de force. The feeling of the work is, I suppose, altogether different. The metal challenges you, coaxes you, as William Morris said of the molten glass, to do a particular kind of thing with it, where its tenacity and ductility make them- selves felt. The clay, again, is delightful, I take it, to handle, to those who have a talent for it; but it is delightful of course in quite different manipulations from those of the wrought-iron . . . when you come to carry (patterns) out in the medium, then, if they are appropriate, or if you succeed in adapting them, they become each a special phase of the embodiment of your whole delight and interest of 'body-and-mind' in handling the clay or metal or wood or molten glass. It is alive in your hands, and its life grows or rather magi- cally springs into shapes which it, and you in it, seem to desire and feel inevitable."</page><page sequence="5">TOUCH-THE NEGLECTED SENSE 203 It is undoubtedly a remarkable fact that only sight and hearing are capable of aesthetic perception; or if it is maintained that pure touch without sight can apprehend the beauty of a pattern in relief or of a statue, then we must take in touch, so far as it deals with solid- ity. I mean as distinguished from the feeling of heat or cold. I suppose that the charac- teristic which makes these senses capable of being channels of the aesthetic perception is their ability to appreciate a structural whole, which seems to differentiate them from the senses of taste and smell, or of touch as dealing with mere heat and cold. L. A. Reid, writing in 1931, leaves the door a little further ajar (A Study in Aesthetics, pp. 70-71, 396-397): As in developed aesthetic experience the discrimination of form plays such an important part, it is natural and right that the objects of the two 'senses' whose discrimination of form is most highly evolved, namely vision and hearing, should receive in aesthetic practice and aesthetic writings the lion's share of attention. (Author's footnote: Touch is in a peculiar position. It is immensely important in coming to know the external world, and has therefore probably more significance at that stage, e.g., in the case of children or blind persons, Normally it acts as an adjunct of visual apprehension through tactual imagery.) Harold Newton Lee, writing in 1938, marks the prevalence of the opinion that touch is outside the realm of genuine aesthetic experience, but in the end dis- agrees with this view (Perception and Aesthetic Value, pp. 26-27): Ever since Plato and Aristotle, it has been maintained by some that sight and hearing are the aesthetic senses; sensations of sight and hearing can be beautiful, but the stimulation of the "lower senses" cannot. This view has a specious plausibility, but it is fundamentally in error in assuming that any sensations, as sensations, are aesthetic. The material of the aesthetic experience is perception. The plausibility arises from the fact that most perceptions are built around sight and hearing; therefore the material of most aesthetic experiences is made up largely of sights and sounds. ... any attempt to maintain that aesthetic experiences must in the nature of the case be visual or auditory and that the "lower senses" cannot furnish the material of beauty seems to be based on sheer dogmatism. Possibly the most vigorous defense of touch as aesthetic agent, however, comes from Helen Huss Parkhurst, writing in 1930 (Beauty, p. 67 ff.): Against touch at least the argument of formlessness, of lack of structure, cannot be directed. Tactual qualities are a primitive, and remain a permanent, means of apprehension of size and shape. In the process of their gradual fusion with other qualities they become indeed so bound up with those of sight that blind handling of familiar things produces a no less complete realization of their appearance than of their form and dimensions. Conversely, the mere visual appearance of an object is sufficient to stimulate clear images of temper- ature, texture, and resistance. . .. the tactile sense is the reality sense par excellence. From childhood forward we assist, when we can, our visual knowledge of things with their acquaintance through handling. ... What we care for, if the caring is bound up with qualities of touch, will be doubly, trebly, missed when it is taken from us. It is a question whether the loss of a little child or of a pet animal upon which protective fondling has been lavished could leave behind a sense of void so aching and poignant were it not that, besides the heart, the hands and the embracing arms are left yearning and empty.... In view of the varied emotional significance of tactual sensations and of their combining power with qualities derived from sight, there would therefore seem to be little room for</page><page sequence="6">204 FRANCES W. HERRING doubt as to the propriety of locating the tactile and kinaesthetic senses in the same class with the organs that mediate colour and sound. Sufficient indication-has been given of the intensity and volume of the sentiments engendered in this lowly way. Such challenges, issued by some authorities to the views of other authorities, perhaps justify us in regarding the possibility of aesthetic tactile experience as at least worth further consideration. Let us therefore examine with some care the prevalent assumption that our reactions to tactile stimuli are almost nec- essarily non-aesthetic, because inevitably practical or instrumental. IV. Consideration of the Psychological Argument. This argument is some- times indirectly and tacitly developed by maintaining that in point of fact one seldom encounters the person who cultivates touch experiences for their intrinsic value; which gives weight to the idea that tactile sensa are not naturally aes- thetic in character. The assertion is often positively made, however, that such cultivation is psychologically difficult, if not indeed impossible. It seems clear that to hold the extreme latter view-that aesthetic tactile ex- perience is impossible-is, to say the least, dogmatic. It ignores, for example, the development of the art forms appealing primarily to the sense of touch, as practiced for centuries by the Chinese. Most of us have seen in museums the delightful small objects shaped to the hand and often beautifully carved, which were designed by the Chinese artist to be carried about in the pocket for the joy of handling them. Authorities on art of the Orient attest that Chinese pottery, jade and ivory are consciously worked with a view to their being handled. Warren E. Cox, writing in 1946 on "Chinese Ivory Sculpture" says: In my book on "Pottery and Porcelain" I spoke of the "tactile appeal" which a fine glaze has; that appeal which causes a Chinese collector to take a piece in his hands and run his fingers over it. The tactile appeal of old ivory is even greater than of an old glazed pottery. This is because, first of all, the surface is a carved one and not simply a melted one. The carver can work exactly the soft change of planes and subtility of curves he wishes.... But the tactile appeal of a piece of old ivory gains in another way: the touches of many hands over a long period of years impart a warm human quality that is hard to describe, but that certainly adds to its charm, and no amount of staining and rubbing can produce the same effect.... A writer on "Chinese Jade: The Sense of Touch," in an article appearing in Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs (1940, pp. 192 if.), makes an even more unreserved statement, suggesting cultural causes for our Western attitude to- ward touch, and possible subtle psychological effects: Jn public collections visitors have little opportunity to appreciate the more subtle aspect of this beautiful material. It needs very careful lighting if it is to be seen at all . . . moreover the material, so cool to the touch, needs to be handled-one might almost say caressed-if one is to understand its peculiar virtue. This is something rather beyond the experience of the average European, though the Chinese have known it for centuries. We take it for granted that the sculptor should have sensitive fingers: it is a little strange to be told that the fingers of the beholder should be no less sensitive. Many an Englishman, bravely struggling upwards to the light from his Puritan past (which, be it said, has, as often as not, given his ear an exquisite judgment on the modulations of music, whether expressed in the verse of Milton or the harmonies of Purcell) has accepted the pleasures of sight with grateful enthusiasm but has shied away</page><page sequence="7">TOUCH--THE NEGLECTED SENSE 205 from the pleasures of touch. Indeed, it may be that a blind man might be a finer connois- seur of jade than one with normal sight. Rather oddly, this point of view has received little more than perfunctory notice in the usual literature on the subject-which is, in any case, small enough, but it has been marked, and memorably, by a modern master of English romantic prose, Mr. H. M. Tomlinson, in Gallions Reach. The reference is quite casual and fleeting but well worth bringing to the notice of collectors of jade. "What at once was seen there, and nothing else, was a bowl of pale jade that appeared to give the silence a faint light, as though it were a lamp. It was honorably isolated and elevated, as though it were the significance of a poet . . . he did not care to approach that luminous fragility ... That? That bowl? Come and handle it. Such things are made to be touched as well as looked at. The touch should know as much as the eye . . . 'Sometimes,' said the Chinaman, 'I have wondered whether Western culture turned into chimney-smoke because of a neglected sense of touch.' " Such comments seize the gauntlet and hurl it boldly at the feet of any Western theorist who would deny what is a palpable fact in the experience of millions of Eastern people. But even if we had not the experience of the Chinese to explode the theory that touch cannot be cultivated for the intrinsic disinterested pleasure of touching, we would be led to question it by the testimony of blind persons, by our observations of children and of artists, and by what we have learned of the art of primitive peoples. More and more since the war, the art museums of America are assuming the task of providing "exhibits" for the blind, and their curators are beginning to remark that blind persons experience a keenness and wholeness of aesthetic de- light as they approach art works through their fingers and hands, which those gifted with sight often seem to miss, and which those with sight might equally well receive. In an article "Fine Arts for the Blind," published in the Magazine of Art for January, 1943, John D. Morse suggests such a conclusion from his experience in conducting classes of blind children through the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. After reporting their exclamations of delight as they classified works of art, by touch, as belonging to one art period rather than another, and such discerning comments as: "We (Americans) resemble the Egyp- tians more than the Romans in our art forms today," Morse observes: Deprived of the pleasure of color, these twenty blind children found the pleasure of texture and sculptural form which other museum visitors must get second-hand through their eyes . . . they were forced to concentrate all their attention on the works of art them- selves . . . I anticipate the day when our museums will have rooms set aside fitted with "touchable" things from every country and period. It is the writer's impression from reading and conversation that the curators of art museums in America are rapidly becoming ardent advocates of tactilism as one means of appreciating certain appropriate art forms; finding neither practical nor aesthetic reasons for discriminating against the sense of touch. Normal children, one half-remembers, and easily confirms in conversation with those who work closely with them, derive pure delight from exploring the tactile qualities of objects-in the same direct way in which they enjoy, without instruction, visual shapes, colors and sounds for their intrinsic quality. Their reactions to objects cannot by any means be reduced to the utilitarian one of "coming to know" the world in a practical sense. They develop games, the point</page><page sequence="8">206 FRANCES W. HERRING of which lies in the repetition of tactile rhythms (often combined with sounds), and exhibit marked preferences for objects on the basis of tactile impressions alone. Which of us has not carried horsechestnuts about in his pocket for the pleasure of handling their satin round solidity? Who has not sifted warm sea-sand through his fingers; ground smooth rubbed stones together in his hand; explored with his fingers the whorls and interstices of beach-worn wood, or pressed a sharp flint against his palm for the pleasure-pain of its unyielding edged resistance? Even those aesthetic theorists who deny to touch any function as mediator of artistic material, occasionally emphasize that much of our aesthetic reaction to nature consists of tactile experiences. But if this is admitted, where is the case for the impossibility of tactilism as mediator of beauty? The argument is no longer one of the psychological impossibility of experiencing beauty through touch, but of some preferred definition as to the object of such experiences.2 Much evidence can be adduced as to the natural tactile pleasures to be re- ceived through sculpture. In point are the art and the art-responses of primitive peoples, as well as of medieval Europe; of children; and of artists themselves. Anyone familiar with the art of early African cultures, or of the Indians of North, South and Central America, can hardly have failed to mark that their objects of art seem to call out irresistibly to be handled. And many of the sculptures of medieval Europe have come down to us with the face of the Babe (for instance) almost obliterated, yet still infinitely appealing, by the loving hands that have passed across it, each one receiving something in the gesture. W. R. Valentiner, speaking of the importance of touch in creating and appre- ciating this art form, brings forth evidence from each of these sources (Origins of Modern Sculpture, 1946): One can touch a piece of sculpture as if it were an organic being; it reminds one of organic forms ... The earliest art we know, that of the paleolithic period, is plastic art. The beautifully cut stone implements of this epoch, and of the neolithic age, appeal at least as much to the sense of touch as they do to the eye. The stone hammers and knives are indeed visually pleasing in outline and form, but we cannot understand their artistic value if we see them only exhibited in cases. We have to take them into our hands and feel their pleasant smoothness, they are made to fit the hand. It was the warmth of touch which the earliest stone sculptor sought. The same generalization applies to early pottery. The best pieces of pre-Columbian, Peruvian and Central American ceramics, for instance, have to be handled if we want to understand the remarkable sensitiveness of their makers in modeling the surfaces... How closely art is connected with the sense of touch can be easily observed in museums, where visitors can hardly be prevented from handling the objects . . . 2W. R. Valentiner, in Origins of Modern Sculpture, puts it this way: "A piece of sculpture like the Human Concretion by the Swiss sculptor, Hans Arp, . . . affects us as beautifully shaped pebbles on some beaches do, but it has an additional aesthetic value given it by a conscious artist's mind, a symbolism expressed in a carefully-thought-out composition; while the pebbles have only accidental forms."</page><page sequence="9">TOUCH--'HE NEGLECTED SENSE 207 Sculpture can give a great deal of pleasure to the blind, as we learn from the visits Helen Keller paid to certain sculptors' studios ... Children are especially fond of fingering sculpture ... In the Detroit Museum there is a piece of bronze sculpture . . . representing a young donkey in about half-size. The mouth, ears and back of the animal have been so rubbed by childrens' hands that the gold-colored metal now shines through the black patina, resulting in a very pleasing effect . . . Sculptures are not always damaged by being touched a great deal. Indeed, certain kinds have their surface appearance improved by frequent rubbing; such, for instance, is the case with African Negro carvings and Renaissance bronzes . . . As with certain prehistoric im- plements, the quality of these sculptures cannot be completely understood unless their forms are felt by the fingers . . it is less generally known that this applies also to medieval plastic art. The great sculptors could not develop in us the strong appeal of the tactile sense if they did not themselves possess the emotional and sensual qualities necessary to produce such effects . . . When Maillol . . went with his friends to the Acropolis in Athens . . he used to caress the ancient stone with an almost religious love, while he meditated on the classical masters who seemed so close to him. Such wealth of evidence as to its existence makes it somewhat ridiculous, then to maintain that aesthetic response to tactile sensa is psychologically impossible* One may hold, however, and many writers have done so, that the supremely practical uses to which our sensitive hands are put, in daily living, have destroyed or overlaid their capacity for disinterested aesthetic response for most of us. To this, the observation is germane that if it is desired to do so, it should be possible with training to recapture, or with earlier training to keep alive, this capacity. The Bauhaus tradition, for example, makes much of tactile-training of children and of adults, both for its intrinsic satisfactions and as a means of developing the ability to render tactual qualities in painting and sculpture. Of course, persons probably differ as much in their capacities in this direction as in their sensitivities to colors and sounds. But it seems highly likely that any faculty which exists so universally in childhood and which is so highly developed in some adults, could be retained by most of us as we grow older and could per- haps be expanded in new aesthetic directions. Gotshalk's observation that art follows communication in favoring sight and hearing over touch perhaps needs to be qualified by the reflection that even in matters of the customary channels of public expression, the use of touch is not outside our usual practice. The handclasp of greeting and parting, the French embrace of salute, the nose-rubbing of Eskimos, the hand-play of primitive dancers, are examples coming readily to mind. Through gestures and speech we may achieve the greatest impersonality of social contact-an advantage no one would deny-but the contribution of con- ventionalized touch to the warmth of human gatherings is a quality most of us would not willingly forego. It is possible thereby to express and receive simple, massive and profound impressions which it is doubtful whether any distance receptor can produce. But there is another facet to the argument that our responses to tactile</page><page sequence="10">208 FRANCES W. HERRING stimuli are instinctively interested and therefore non-aesthetic. This is the view that because the sense of touch is so intimately bound up with erotic expression, its exercise for the apprehending of form, texture, solidity for their own sakes is virtually a psychological impossibility. The writer has wondered, indeed, that this objection has not been more openly advanced in the literature of art; but at least it has been delicately suggested, and in modern writing is occasionally overtly stated. The close association of touch with eroticism may indeed go as far as any single reason toward explaining why there has been so little done with an art form appealing to this sense. If the psychological tie is too close to per- mit the unhinging, as it were, of the association, then tactilism is indeed outside the pale of Western society. But is the sense of touch really unique in this respect? Can we deny that there is also a remarkably intimate relationship between the visual and auditory senses and erotic experience? We must remember that Plato held that only martial music was free of dan- gerous and softening influence, pointing out the efficacy of music in arousing sexual desire. And the church has condemned in turn sculpture, drama and the dance as immoral for the same reason. Many of us who endured a Puritanical upbringing will attest that the novel and lyric poetry were regarded with sus- picion as tending to relax moral firmness. It need hardly be said that there are persons whose interest in painting, sculp- ture, music and the dance is so interwoven with primary sexual reactions that they cannot be said to know the aesthetic experience as such at all. Without doubt, also, the untutored first reactions of sexually awakened persons to the nude human figure in the arts, or to certain suggestive musical or choreographic rhythms, are far indeed from the responses which they may later be able to give to the same stimuli. There is often at the very least a kind of provincial em- barrassment felt by those brought up in an unaesthetic tradition, which inter- feres for a time with the acquiring of the necessary detachment and self-forget- fulness to permit them to see and hear a work of art in a disinterested fashion. Nevertheless, few would deny that the erotic significance of the work of art is an integral and legitimate part of the work's expressiveness. The question is not, whether a sense preeminently fitted to arouse erotic re- sponse is therefore incapable of serving as an avenue to "pure" aesthetic ex- perience, but rather whether the sense of touch, alone of all the senses, is in fact found to be incapable of the degree of divorcement such experience requires. In answer to this question I can do no more than elicit the aesthetic responses of the blind, of Orientals nurtured in another art tradition, of artists themselves and of that growing number of Western moderns who have had the experience of appreciating tactile art, and art tactually, in proof of the fact that such de- tachment has in fact proved to be not difficult to attain. Our answer to the psychological objection to tactile art-experience, then, may be summarized by saying that while touch, like the other senses, serves pre- eminently practical uses, and although it may function as stimulant to erotic response, it is apparently capable of independent development as agent of aes- thetic emotions, in a degree comparable to that attained by the senses of sight and hearing.</page><page sequence="11">TOUCH-THE NEGLECTED SENSE 209 V. Consideration of the Technical Argument. In spite of the invention, by Christian Morgenstern's fictional character, Korff, of a smell-organ, and in spite of the rumored creation, in France, between the wars, of a "symphony for cheese," most of us would agree upon reflection that stable art forms directed toward the senses of smell and taste suffer from the transient character of the responses they evoke and the inherent difficulties of ordering them according to any aesthetic principles whatever. But do the same objections hold for touch? Are the structural elements common to the visual and auditory arts-such elements as unity in variety, dominance and equilibrium-inapplicable to touch experiences? More: do the sense data uniquely given by touch correspond to no objectively measurable scales of order such as underlie hue, value and its intensity of color; or pitch, timbre, and intensity of tone? In one sense this whole question lies outside the field of aesthetics. But be- cause of the prominence given to the mechanics of measurement of music and painting, for example, and the familiar argument that the senses appealed to by these arts are adapted to aesthetic reaction partly because of our capacity to enjoy unconsciously the mathematically exact relationships between contrasting tones and hues, it seems necessary to spend a little time investigating the anal- ogous position of touch in this regard. One meaning of the assertion that tactile sensations have no principles of order is that they cannot be measured. Now it is obvious that units of measure do not present themselves ready-made on the surface of any type of sensa. What is required, if we are to measure any quality, is first of all the ability to dis- tinguish it as present or absent, all or none, there or not there. Then, with attention and training, it may be possible to distinguish degrees (quantities) of presence of a quality (an ordinal dimension). The last step is to invent and name units which correspond to our perceptive abilities to distinguish such quantities, and to arrange them on a scale in order of size (a cardinal dimension). Is anyone prepared to say that the qualities discernible through touch are in- trinsically a-dimensional in the first (ordinal) sense? Surely the ability to detect degrees of presence of tactile quality is within the power of most of us. We can distinguish degrees of lightness to heaviness-a weight dimension; we can dis- tinguish degrees of softness to hardness-a solidity dimension; degrees of warmth to coldness-a temperature dimension; degrees of smoothness to roughness-a texture dimension. Other scales, less frequently used are theoretically possible: pliability to rigidity; friability to strength, etc. And experiments have shown that sensitivity of discrimination in all these directions can be greatly refined with practice.3 3 Cf. the following instructions to buyers, appearing in Isabel Wingate's Textile Fabric8 (1942, p. 49 if., "Ways of Recognizing Textile Fabrics"): "The warmth, coolness, softness, pliability, smoothness or strength of a cloth can best be judged by the sense of touch. Buyers should feel every piece of textile merchandise that is offered them . .. To feel goods, grasp the edge of a cloth between the thumb and index finger, with the thumb on top. Rub the thumb and forefinger across the cloth, then lengthwise, then in a circle. Each time a fabric is felt, words that best describe the feel should be brought to mind: pliability, elas- ticity or 'give', warmth, softness, smoothness, and so on."</page><page sequence="12">210 FRANCES W. HERRING This analysis reveals a tactile situation analogous to that in which we say that a person can recognize differences of tone, or shades of a color, by the appropriate sense. But aesthetic theory has customarily regarded as significant the ex- istence, in the case of music and painting, of an underlying physical structure which accounts for the order of our sense impressions. Are there no such phys- ical measurables underlying the phenomena apprehended through the sense of touch? Of course there are. Cardinal units for measuring weight and temperature are among the first invented by man; and the needs of modern industry have stimulated the development of uniform measures of many other tactilely dis- tinguishable qualities. Texture, for example, is shown to be a matter of size of surface interstices; and it is possible to measure with increasing accuracy the tensile strength, rigidity, friability of objects. Experiments are continually being performed with a view to standardization of measures and of terminology, regarding other qualities ordinarily distinguishable in a rough way by touch, or by touch-and-sight. There has been a deal of confused thinking on this subject in the literature. One source of confusion here has been the failure to keep clearly in mind the fact that many sense data apprehended as sight and sound, are actually complex in origin, having been built by the combined action of eyes, ears and hands. In experience our sense organs are seldom exercised separately but are simul- taneously engaged in exploring objects which appeal to several senses at once. After the interrelations of the various qualities of experience have been learned- the correspondence of a visual patch of color with a certain felt shape, with a certain kinesthetically measured distance, with a certain felt texture, hardness, weight or temperature-we can then get the complex of these qualities indirectly through the mediation of any one of the senses involved. Those who make much of the fact that only eyes and ears are capable of giving us finely distinct impressions are inadvertently, perhaps, crediting to those or- gans an apperceptive acuity which has in fact been derived partly, and in part uniquely, through touch. This fact is the more readily forgotten because we have given the same name in many cases to qualities mediated by more than one sense. Impressions of shape and size, for instance, are constructed from data received by either eye or hand; and to some extent this is true of texture as well. Yet whatever the source of the impression, the same name serves. Color, on the other hand, belongs to sight alone; while for the most part weight, temperature, solidity belong to touch alone. Those who hold that touch data are difficult if not impossible to order are referring to data received uniquely through touch, no doubt. But these, we have shown, unquestionably yield to ordering relationships. The evidence is replete, then, that our tactile impressions resemble those of sight and hearing both in their capacity for organization on "natural" scales of perceived degrees of a quality and in their correspondence to certain structural relations in the object which may be measured with any desired degree of re- finement. Let us now return to the earlier question: whether widely accepted aesthetic</page><page sequence="13">TOUCH-THE NEGLECTED SENSE 211 canons, such as Parker's unity in variety, dominance and equilibrium are or are not applicable to touch experiences. To this writer it seems obvious-and it has been the unanimous report of those to whom inquiry has been made on the subject-that it is natural, meaningful and accurate to say that in experiencing an object through the sense of touch we experience organic wholes on the tactile level. Within the unified experience it is possible to discern elements of theme and thematic variation; of balance, symmetrical or otherwise; of rhythm; of dominance. Inasmuch as direct or in- direct tactile experiences are part of the whole impressions received through all the arts (with the possible exception of music), what more to be expected than that our analysis of the structural principles underlying good art should not in- frequently take account of them? To put it another way, the so-called principles of aesthetic form are those structural elements by which it is possible to grasp perceptually the complex object through touch, just as through sight. The writer agrees with Harold Newton Lee, quoted above, in holding: Aesthetic form is the organization of perceptual materials according to those structural and qualitative relations which are given in immediate apprehension . .. Rhythm, proportion, balance . . . are structural elements . the objective factors in many of the situations in which beauty is experienced. To summarize: tactile impressions exhibit principles of order, both in the sense of yielding clearlydistinguishable and objectivelymeasurable qualities analagous to those of sight and sound; and in the sense of being appropriately judged by the aesthetic canons applicable to all the arts. VI. Consideration of the Philosophical Argument. There remains the most significant and telling objection of all-the view that touch data are incapable of expressing our larger and deeper life experiences. When all is said and done, what matter whether it is psychologically and technically possible to create and enjoy tactile art, if the experiences to which it gives rise are essentially shallow and unimportant? Any branch of art, we legitimately feel, would be intrinsically superficial if it were limited in its appeal to the arousing of our appreciation of its "surface," "material" or "formal" beauty. The great masterpieces of any art formulate and quicken our deepest insights into life's promise and significance. Art has a vital and central role to play in real life. That part, we say, is to express values. Even though there is less than full agreement among artists and aestheticians as to precisely what this phrase connotes, there is a wide-spread effort to give it. concrete meaning. Hospers, in Meaning and Truth in the Arts, (p. 12) is explicit that it is one of the chief functions of art to express the larger life of feeling and thought: Only a small part of our enjoyment of the arts ... consists in enjoyment of aesthetic sur- face or aesthetic form simply in themselves. Indeed our appreciation of works of art does not usually consist primarily of these at all . .. The sensuous surface . . . is to say the least, not predominant; and if the form is, it is employed chiefly as a vehicle for something beyond itself-something conveyed through the form and upon the aesthetic surface. This some-</page><page sequence="14">212 FRANCES W. HERRING thing comes from life, from the world of experience outside art, and for lack of a better term I shall call what is thus conveyed life-values. This forthright statement goes somewhat beyond what many writers would be willing to assert, in its apparently unguarded opening of the door to "the world of experience outside art." A. R. Chandler, for example, in Beauty and Human Nature (pp. 12-13), is more cautious in his wording of the phrase, and inclined to point out qualifications as to its full place in aesthetic experience. After de- fining the typical aesthetic impression as having three characteristics: (1) iso- lation ("Aesthetic experience is complete in itself"); (2) unity ("Its parts all hang together;" "It should be impossible to add to it or subtract from it, or to change the relations among its parts, without impairing the effect"); and (3) significance ("The intuition usually expresses something which is important to us"); he adds: Whether some degree of significance is indispensable may be left an open question for the present. At any rate, there is an extraordinary variation in the degree of significance. And Bosanquet, quoted above, warns: When the communication of the idea substitutes itself as a purpose for the need of expres- sion in sensuous form, the limit of art is overstepped and . . . becomes didactic. We may properly insist that art be not asked to take the place of science and morals in discovering and interpreting the meanings of life. Nevertheless we may hold that art is peculiarly fitted to express certain unique aspects of ex- perience, and may inquire what these aspects are. Parker, in his two illuminating chapters on the definition and the intrinsic value of art (The Principles of Aesthetics), brings together the ideas of many other writers on this subject in such phrases as these: The work of art should "produce an imaginative realization of tendencies which cannot find play in real life." It should "help us master our emotions, bring them into the light, order them in articulate form, receive assuagement and peace." It should "universalize and communicate feeling, socialize feeling, widen the scope of common life." It should "embrace the values of ideas which lie behind the form." And he sum- marizes these chapters, giving his own view, as follows (p. 42): Art is expression, not of mere things or ideas, but of concrete experience with its values, for its own sake. It is experience held in a delightful, highly organized sensuous medium, and objectified there for communication and reflection. Its value is in the sympathetic mastery and preservation of life in the imagination. Using such expressions as these, as at least partially satisfactory yardsticks, we must now inquire whether, when the sense of touch is called into play as the agent of aesthetic emotion, such meanings must inevitably fail to be involved. Perusal of the literature reveals that modern writers on sculpture and its aes- thetic principles find in plastic art-touchable art large symbolic meanings, very far indeed from being limited to appreciation of surface or formal beauty. Valentiner, for example, quoted earlier for his emphasis on the importance of touch in creating and appreciating art, is concerned to point out the deep ex-</page><page sequence="15">TOUCH-THE NEGLECTED SENSE 213 pressiveness of plastic art forms. He sees the abstract sculpture of our times as peculiarly fitted to convey our contemporary preoccupation with the "creative energies which initiate and sustain life." To quote him further: The sculptors of our time are interested in what was formerly called the lower forms of life, in animals like reptiles and fish which were among the first to inhabit the earth. Brancusi shows the beginning of organic life in his egg-shaped forms. Flannagan has created more than once the moment when life penetrated the shell of the egg and produced an animal out of the seemingly inorganic materials ... In Henry Moore's art the human beings are devel- oping from the first unconscious state of mind into reality, their transformation from earth to life being hardly completed; while Lipchitz' bodies appear as if they had just been created out of earth by God's hands, carrying with them still all the qualities of earth in their heavy massive shapes. The most characteristic expression of active life energy penetrating into the body and pressing violently through its veins is seen in the art of Gaston Lachaise. Whether or not one agrees with Valentiner's analysis of the import and sig- nificance of much modern sculpture, the capacity of such art to express values is clearly assumed by him as too obvious to need comment or defense. And no one can follow the controversies which flourish among devotees of differ- ent schools of sculptural expression without admitting that the appropriateness of the medium to render deep life meanings is taken for granted by all. To de- fend the view that touch is impotent to deliver vital immediate insights into life-values, one must hold that it not permissible to use the hands in appre- ciating plastic art a position which we have tried to show is indefensible, from any purely aesthetic standpoint. One may speculate on the possibility that the opinion of Bosanquet (in which he follows Kant and others) that "the art of sculpture admits, compared with the other arts, of very little ideality, that is, of very little subtlety of variety of intellectual or emotional interpretation" arises from the comparatively late de- velopment, in our culture, of abstract sculpture. European music and painting freed themselves of crude anthropomorphism earlier than the other arts, leaving sculpture far behind. But primitive sculp- ture, Egyptian sculpture, modern sculpture all speak to us through relatively abstract or stylized forms in which the symbolic meanings peculiarly expressible in plastic media may be clearly apprehended. The impression that through touch we cannot comprehend life-values may, then, derive partially from the fact that the works of art open to tactile appreciation were not themselves con- cerned with the expression of such values. Neither eye nor hand could extract from them what was not there. If this is so, the movement of interest in modern sculpture away from the sheerly representative may well bring with it a quickened realization of the role which the touching hand may play, as well as the seeing eye, in appreciating values. It should be clear from this discussion that in this writer's opinion it would partake of aesthetic artificiality to attempt to separate the contribution of the sense of touch from one's total reaction to a work of art. Tactile appreciation is not something to be cultivated as a tour de force, in isolation from other aes- thetic stimuli with which it is associated naturally, as if it were necessary or</page><page sequence="16">214 FRANCES W. HERRING desirable to give constant evidence of its capacity to mediate aesthetic experience. Marcel Duchamps' experiments, for example, in creating plastic art forms which are to be enjoyed by thrusting one's hand inside a box to move over the form within, seem to be in the nature of a piano exercise, justifiable perhaps as a device for training the sense of touch to greater fineness of discrimination. It is not a promising approach to the creation of genuinely enjoyable tactile art, which, no more than drama or the dance, should be shorn of the accompaniments of those contributory arts which sharpen and intensify the whole aesthetic experience. In whatever way eye and hand may cooperate in bringing us delight, each makes its unique contribution. What is it that touch uniquely contributes? One may only try to suggest in an evocative way what it is. To anyone to whom the avenues of aesthetic tactile pleasure are closed, the description is sure to remain verbal. On the basis of introspection, then, extended by questioning of artists and those who live with art, as well as of the blind, one finds a remarkable concur- rence of report that aesthetic tactile experiences are among the most profoundly integrating of any obtainable through art. Perhaps because it is biologically the oldest sense, out of which the other senses have developed through the long ages, it seems psychologically easiest to achieve a sense of restoration to simplicity, of unity, through touch. Through touch one participates imaginatively in the "sensations" of lower and simpler life forms-of ivy clinging to crevices and trees swaying in the wind; of sea-wrack swinging with the tide, and yellow verbena sprawling over the hot sand in the sun. Touch reweaves our ties with the early far-off things. Contrary to Bosanquet's intellectualistic distinction, touch, even in its aspect as "dealing with mere heat and cold," can bring us an animistic sense of identity with the inanimate, as the cold polished stone or metal takes our own warmth and life, cools our thought-engendered fevers, calms and quiets us. Touch gives us the "insides" of things. Many writers have noticed this. The careful analytical statement of H. H. Price deserves quotation (Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, n.s. Vol. 44, "Touch and Organic Sensation"): A visible object, if you consider it as being merely visible, consists merely of outsides. If you call it "solid" you are using that word in a purely geometrical sense; you mean merely that a three-dimensional volume of space is completely surrounded by color expanses. Even if the object breaks into bits or is cut open, you still see nothing but new outsides . . But the tangible object (i.e., the object revealed by muscular sensation and contact sen- sation combined) is actually experienced as having an inside . . . As Locke said, "If anyone asks me what this solidity is, I send him to his senses to inform him. Let him put a flint or a football between his hands and then endeavor to join them, and he will know." ... it may ... be true that although visual experience is more extensive, tactuo-muscular experience is more profound.4 4Price makes some enormously suggestive observations on the different types of causal theory developed by visual-minded as contrasted with tactuo-muscular-minded philoso- phers. If it is possibly true that atrophy of tactile experiences in certain philosophical thinkers has tended to produce reductive theories as to the character of fundamental world- processes, we should indeed have a dignified "case" for supporting art-forms which would cultivate these neglected powers and intuitions!</page><page sequence="17">TOUCH-THE NEGLECTED SENSE 215 We have already quoted Helen Parkhurst as holding that touch is the reality sense par excellence; a view shared by psychologists who, in administering the Rohrschach tests, interpret the reaction of the person who responds to a visual surface in terms of felt textures-"it is rough," "it is like fur"-as being "in touch with reality." The contention that touch is inherently unsuited to express the deeper values of life may indeed be a kind of rationalization after the fact. Possibly it is the practical functions of eyes and ears which have crowded touch to the wall in Western civilization and thus cut short the aesthetic career of this sense. Eyes and ears are supreme after all in practical living because they report conditions at a distance and thus permit time for adjustment of the organism short of actual (possibly harmful) contact. Such a function, while immensely useful, surely warrants no conclusions as to the intrinsic fitness of these organs, rather than the hands, to serve as agents of aesthetic response. It is possible today to live on levels more and more distantly removed from the rich manifold of experience, substituting the symbolic gesture for the par- ticipating act throughout great areas of life. There are even strong practical advantages in so living. But can one believe that the texture of experience is made richer, thicker, warmer thereby? Those who dwell in a reductive aes- thetic world-a world in which the joys of touch are given only indirectly, at second-hand, through sight-seem to this writer to inhabit an impoverished, an infra-real world. It is now possible to answer briefly the question with which this inquiry began: whether there are sound aesthetic reasons for the meagreness of tactile art ex- pression in Western cultures. After this arraignment of the sense of touch before the bar of investigation and judgment, we charge that no sound case against the aesthetic fitness of the sense has been established by witnesses against it. Reasons which are aes- thetically irrelevant, offshoots of practical, religious, or other strands of our cultural heritage seem to be responsible for our lamentable condition of poverty in tactile art. In conclusion, one may note with satisfaction that the movement toward ex- plicit recognition of the function of touch in aesthetic experience is already dis- cernibly under way in Europe and America. It deserves to be encouraged by artists and public alike, as a healthy rounding-out and enrichment of aesthetic life, and enhancement of the value-expressiveness of art.</page></plain_text>
