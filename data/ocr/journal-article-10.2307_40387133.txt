A review of the evidence, with new AMS determinations BRUNO DAVID, RUTH ANN ARMITAGE, MARIAN HYMAN, MARVIN W. ROWE and EWAN LAWSON Abstract It has been 18 years since Andrée Rosenfeld suggested that the rock-art of north Queensland changed from non-figurative to mainly figurative forms some 5-4000 years ago. Her views were based on a small regional database and on indirect chronological evidence. This paper looks afresh at the antiquity of north Queensland's rock-art by reviewing the existing evidence - much elaborated since Rosenfeld's pioneering work - and by present- ing new AMS radiocarbon results undertaken directly on rock-art. Her general chronological model is supported and refined by these new findings. In 1981, Andrée Rosenfeld suggested that Aboriginal people at Laura (SE Cape York) had changed the way they decorated caves and rockshelters sometime around 5-4000 BP (Rosenfeld et α/., 1981). Following upon her archaeological excavations at the Early Man Rocksheiter, she argued that before 13,000 BP Aboriginal people were decorating rockshelters by pecking1 abstract designs such as tridents, pits, mazes, rings and rounded enclosures with internal patterns. At the Early Man site, such pecked designs had been uncovered, buried beneath stratified deposits of that age. In many other sites, similar peckings had attained a deep surface patina, testimony of their considerable age. Andrée Rosenfeld also observed that in some sites, less patinated peckings could also be found. These were similar in shape to the older Early Man designs, although new forms also appeared. Such a pattern of continuity with change was in many ways akin to observations made 16 years earlier by John Mulvaney for stone arte- facts at Kenniff Cave some 1100 km to the south, where he had argued that around 5000 years ago new tool types began to be manufactured and used together with a conti- nuity of older forms (Mulvaney &amp; Joyce, 1965). At Laura, Andrée thus argued that motifs such as mazes and tridents continued to be made, probably for thousands of years, while other designs such as discs at the Quinkan Galleries, macropod tracks and star-shapes were added onto the pecked corpus. However, figurative designs still failed to appear (apart for some animal tracks) (Rosenfeld et ai, 1981:86-7). The great antiquity of the former, she argued, could be seen in the buried peckings at Early Man and in the heavy to moderate patina which had accumulated over them at other sites. But peckings were not simply old. Andrée also argued that figurative motifs were added onto the reper- toire of Laura's rock- art late during the course of his- tory. This was evident in the engravings, where animal and human tracks, anthropomorphs and boomerangs began to be depicted, perhaps 5-4000 years ago, at vari- ous sites around Laura (including Early Man). 'It is probable', she concluded (Rosenfeld et al., 1981:88), 'that figurative engravings continued until "the recent past'", meaning until the arrival of Europeans. Based on the distribution of ochre in her excavations, she further argued that it was during this period of time (from 5-4000 BP until less than 200 years ago) that Laura's cave paintings also began to be systematically made (in this paper, we use the term 'painting' to refer to both wet and dry pigment art (i.e. including drawings). Paintings and drawings proper occur contemporane- ously in the rock-art sequence). She concluded (Rosenfeld et al, 1981:34): It seems clear, therefore, that some rock engravings are contemporary with the tradition of rock painting, whereas between the early engraved frieze and the painted frieze [at Early Man] there is virtually no overlap. ... It is more difficult to assess the probable origins of the painting tradition, but two factors indicate that it is unlikely to be older than some 4000-5000 years . . . Andrée's chronology for Laura's rock-art has consid- erable implications for SE Cape York history. While her dating of the art has recently been revised by indepen- dent researchers (in particular Noelene Cole, Alan Watchman, Mike Morwood and the present authors; see below), her general schema has withstood the test of time.

In this paper, the term 'pecking' refers to any engraved picture resulting from the repeated percussion of a sur- face, irrespective of whether or not a chisel or punch was used between the hammer and the rock surface. In the vast majority of cases, we do not think it is possi- ble to distinguish between pictures pecked by direct or by indirect (chisel/punch) percussion. 103</page><page sequence="2">early pecking tradition dominated by non-figurative motifs, followed by paintings and engravings of both fig- urative and non-figurative forms. There is also general agreement that the majority of Laura's extant paintings date to the mid to late Holocene period, although the degree to which earlier pigment art has disappeared from the walls is a matter for debate. Of archaeological interest is the more recent observa- tion that while the old, patinated pecked motifs are wide- spread, Laura's paintings are more restricted in their dis- tribution, being formally different to those of neighbouring regions, such as the Koolburra Plateau to the northwest, Princess Charlotte Bay to the north, and the Mitchell-Palmer and Chillagoe to the south (see David &amp; Chant, 1995; David &amp; Lourandos, 1998 for dis- cussions). The significance of this is that if the paintings of SE Cape York indeed only date to the mid to late Holocene, as originally suggested by Andrée, then also implicated is a régionalisation of artistic practices since that time. This has considerable ramifications for our understanding of past socio-demographic trends, in par- ticular for changes in the way people expressed and organised themselves on the ground through symbolic behaviour (David &amp; Lourandos, 1998). There is, therefore, a need to test and refine our under- standing of north Queensland's rock-art, both for its own sake and for its broader implications concerning past rela- tions between people and place. Much circumstantial evi- dence has already been accumulated generally supporting and refining Andrée's original chronological model. Some 'direct' AMS radiocarbon dates have also appeared in press. It is now time to review this diverse evidence, which lies scattered in various books and journals, at times in obscure places. This paper thus attempts to test and further refine existing chronological models for north Queensland's cave paintings, by both reviewing the post- Rosenfeld evidence for the antiquity of north Queensland's rock-art, as well as by presenting new AMS results directly undertaken on a series of charcoal paintings from the Chillagoe region, located 100 km to the south of the Laura sandstone belt. These chronological models grew from Andrée's pioneering work at Laura, and now require to be tested by a joining of forces between archaeologists, chemists and dating experts (see also Cole et al, 1995). The region Cape York2 is Australia's largest peninsula (Fig. 1). It juts north of latitude 17°30', pointing towards the island of Papua New Guinea to which it was attached during the last glacial maximum. The region is monsoonal, receiving heavy rains during the wet season (November- April), and less than 10% of its mean annual rainfall dur- ing the rest of the year. The eastern coastal strip is rarely over 5 km wide. To the west is the Great Dividing Range, its gentle western slopes leading to extensive flat plains extending further westward to the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is on the Great Dividing Range and along its western slopes that rock outcrops are commonly found, many of which are decorated with rock-art. Geologically, Cape York is diverse, containing vol- canic (mainly granite and basalt) and sedimentary rocks (mainly sandstone and limestone). It is among the latter that most of the rock-art has been recorded, especially in the Koolburra Plateau, Laura and Ngarrabullgan (sand- stone), and the Mitchell-Palmer and Chillagoe-Mungana- Rookwood (limestone) regions. The rock-art of SE Cape York Almost all of the rock-art of SE Cape York is found in caves or rockshelters. It is very rarely found on rock out- crops or pavements, unless these occur in close associa- tion with overhangs. SE Cape York is renowned as one of the world's great rock-art regions, popularly captured in the label 'Quinkan Country' (Trezise, 1969, 1971). However, this is somewhat of a misnomer. Quinkans are Dreaming beings that frequent only certain parts of the region, in particular the area around Laura (Cole, 1992). Accordingly, depictions of Quinkans in the art are only found in the Laura district, being totally absent from areas further afield such as Ootan, Chillagoe, Mungana, Rookwood and Ngarrabullgan to the south, and Jane Table Hill, Clack Island, Cliff Island and the Flinders Island group to the north3. Even at Laura, depictions of Quinkans are not found amongst all types of rock-art, being restricted to the paintings which Andrée had sug- gested are no more than 5000 years old. Therefore, if Andrée's general chronology is correct, even at Laura Quinkans emerged in the rock-art only late in history. The rock-art of SE Cape York has traditionally been divided into three broad techniques by archaeologists, stencils, engravings and paintings. Stencils are geograph- ically widespread, occurring in all regions where system- atic surveys have been undertaken. Engravings tend to be restricted to limestone and sandstone country; they are almost never found on the harder granites or basalts (but see David &amp; Wilson, 1998). Engravings Most of SE Cape York's engravings are pecked, although abrasions and poundings are also found. Heavily pati- 2. Cape York refers to both the very tip of the peninsula and to the peninsula as a whole. In this paper, the term is only used in its latter sense. 3. Three Quinkan paintings have been recorded from the Mitchell-Palmer limestone belt to the immediate south of Laura. Two of these are painted in juxtaposi- tion at a site known as People's Palace; the third is in a cave near Mitchell River Cave (David &amp; Chant, 1995: fig. 98). 104</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1 . SE Cape York, showing location of regions from which rock-art has been systematically recorded. nated peckings are found in all regions where engravings have been recorded: the Koolburra Plateau, Laura, the Mitchell-Palmer and Chillagoe-Mungana-Rookwood. Patinated peckings include mazes, pits (sometimes singly, sometimes in rows or sets), star-shapes, circles and their variants, single or sets of lines and structurally simple linear, non-figurative designs. In the Koolburra Plateau, Mitchell-Palmer and Chillagoe-Mungana- Rookwood, macropod and bird tracks are also present. Patinated pickings have been argued to possess consider- able antiquity by all researchers who have come across them during the course of their research in SE Cape York, from Trezise in the 1960s (e.g. 1969, 1971), to Rosenfeld who was able to convincingly argue for their minimum age of ~13,000BP at the Early Man site, to Flood (1987) who argued for a minimum age of 7280±130 BP (ARL-155) in the Koolburra Plateau (based on associations with occupied deposits). At Sandy Creek 1 near Laura, a pecked sandstone fragment was found buried beneath sediments dated to 12,620±370 BP (Beta 51089) (Morwood et al, 1995:78-79). Other buried peckings have been found beneath sediments at Green Ant Shelter (Koolburra Plateau) (&gt;1570±60 BP (Beta 3777)); Sandy Creek 1 (&gt;1890±70 BP (SUA 2887)); and Yam Camp (Laura) (&gt;950±50 BP (Beta 35291)) (Flood, 1987; Morwood &amp; Dagg, 1995; 105 ~~T ' Flinders Island Group ' J3^ Λ r^-r Princess ^ /' / Γ Λ / ' Charlotte Γν_^ / s^ ' y [ ' Bay J L Γ L ' ( ' Koolburra / ( '"ν/^Λ V ^y~^J ' Plateau·) / I ) ? /~^~ / / ) '^-^^' (/^^^Cooktown r Laura ·ν ' ' f ^MITCHELL-PALME» · '' V.

At Chillagoe, David and Chant (1995) also argued for their Pleistocene antiquity through their association with dated occupation at Fern Cave (now dated as beginning 30,300±800 BP (OZD 205)) and Walkunder Arch Cave (beginning around 15,950±770 BP (Beta 17358)) (Campbell &amp; Mardaga- Campbell, 1993), while at Magnificent Gallery, Cole et al. (1995:154) have argued for their maximum antiquity shortly before 10,250±90 BP (SUA 2876) by association with the commencement of human occupation. Recently, Cole et al. (1995) and Campbell and Mardaga-Campbell (1993) have obtained minimum AMS radiocarbon determinations for oxalates captured in stratified, laminated cortex found immediately over peckings. At Walkunder Arch Cave near Chillagoe, Campbell and Mardaga-Campbell (1993:59) have reported a single radiocarbon date of 7085±135 BP (AA 9220) for oxalates over a patinated, pecked star-shape, indicating its minimum age. At Sandy Creek 1, a mini- mum date of 2810+150 BP (NZA 1206) has been obtained for accumulated crust deposits over a linear non-figurative pecking, but we are not told whether or not this picture is patinated (Cole et al, 1995:155-156). At Deighton Lady, a reworked pecked maze, parts of which are very patinated and others fresh and unpati- nated, has been dated to more than 2784±85 BP (NZA 2575). However, Cole et al (1995:156) warn that this radiocarbon date probably represents 'the most recent refurbishing of much older engravings'. At the Kennedy River site, a lightly pecked bird track with unreported degrees of patination has been dated to over 1210±245 BP (AA 9221) (Cole et al 1995:156). And in Quinkan B6 Rocksheiter, a set of radiating lines was similarly dated to &gt;2850±115 BP (AA 9222) (Cole et al. 1995:156). The level of patination on this picture was not reported. The patinated, non-figurative peckings of SE Cape York thus appear to have some considerable antiquity, at least in some cases going back to Pleistocene times. This is consistent with Rosenfeld's original views. Unfortunately, all of the radiocarbon determinations dating cortex development in direct association with peckings are minimal dates, so it is not possible to argue with any conviction the spread of time involved in their creation. However, there are also now further data to test Andrée's contention that peckings are not restricted to Pleistocene or early Holocene times. In addition to the patinated engravings, there are also what appear to be more recent, unpatinated peckings in some regions, par- ticularly at Laura and the Koolburra Plateau. In the Koolburra Plateau, Flood (1987) has reported two cases of unpatinated over patinated peckings. Cole et al (1995:156) have argued that the pecking from Deighton Lady reported above was last reworked around 2784±85 BP (NZA 2575), even though the original pecking is probably much older than this, while the figurative peck- ings (including a dingo) at the Amphitheatre Site must date to less than 4000-3500 BP (time of arrival of dogs in Australia). A very few unpatinated peckings have also been found in the Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone (from the People's Palace site only). These unpatinated peck- ings include both figurative and non-figurative forms, reminiscent of the late Holocene paintings (see below). A small number of what appear to be very recent, unpati- nated, shallow pounded pits have also been recorded from the Chillagoe-Mungana-Rookwood region further to the south (David &amp; David, 1988). In sum, we can say that patinated peckings throughout SE Cape York tend to be very old, dating to the early Holocene and/or late Pleistocene. At Laura they are in some cases older than 13,000 BP. In the Koolburra Plateau, patinated peckings are believed to be more than -7300 BP by association with occupied deposits. Motif forms consist of patinated pits, circles and their variants, mazes, star-shapes, single and multiple lines, and simple linear motifs. In the Koolburra Plateau, Laura, and in some very rare cases in the Mitchell-Palmer area, peck- ings were also undertaken during more recent, mid to late Holocene times, by then including both non-figura- tive and figurative designs (including dogs and anthropo- morphs). We do not know whether this indicates a conti- nuity of tradition, or whether pecking activity stopped, perhaps around the early Holocene, to resume again dur- ing the mid to late Holocene (see Cole et al, 1995; Flood, 1987; and Rosenfeld et al, 1981 for further details). Paintings SE Cape York's paintings are geographically highly regionalised (see David &amp; Chant, 1995; David &amp; Lourandos, 1998 for discussions). This is so of motif forms and of design linearity, use of infilling and of internal decorations. To a lesser extent, regionalism is also apparent in the use of specific colours (see David &amp; Chant (1995) for multivariate statistical results). If the paintings are highly regionalised but the old, patinated peckings are not, are we seeing the operation of a synchronous, dual system of some considerable antiquity (for discussion of dual artistic systems in the Sydney Basin see McDonald, 1994)? Or are we rather observing evidence of change through time, from a rela- tively widespread pecking tradition to the emergence of regionalised painting (and pecking) conventions? The latter has considerable implications for our understand- ing of landed, symbolic behaviour, demography and ter- ritoriality in northeastern Australian history (see David, in press a; in press b for discussions). Resolution of these two alternatives rests with our ability to understand the art's antiquity. How old are SE Cape York's paintings? There are a number of ways in which the absolute or rel- ative age of SE Cape York's cave paintings have been 106</page><page sequence="5">estimated. Each approach, of its own, does not say much about the antiquity of the paintings as a whole. Together, however, they offer considerable circumstantial evidence for their late Holocene antiquity. Animals of known antiquity In most parts of SE Cape York where figurative art is found, paintings of animals of known antiquity are depicted. Such animals fall into two categories; in addi- tion, the absence of some species in the art adds further support for its apparent age. Firstly, none of the paintings have been identified as of extinct animals - such as thy- lacines or megafauna - by any of the archaeologists who have worked in the region, implying that the paint- ings date to a time after their extinction (given the over- whelmingly figurative nature of the northern paintings). Megafauna almost certainly became extinct during the late Pleistocene (and most likely before 30,000, and per- haps even before 50,000 BP); an absence of such Pleistocene fauna in the art likely rules out a pre-30,000 BP for figurative depictions. Thylacines, however, became extinct much later, during the mid Holocene, probably around the time dingoes arrived. A total absence of thylacines in the art implies that figurative traditions largely, if not entirely, date to the last 4000 years (contrast with the paintings in Arnhem Land), although using absence of evidence as evidence of absence has of course to be treated cautiously. Secondly, there is the presence of dogs in the paint- ings. Dogs never occur among the patinated peckings found in caves or rockshelters. However, the finding of a pecked dingo in an open setting at the Amphitheatre Site near Laura (Cole &amp; Trezise, 1992) supports Andrée's contention that certain peckings, including some of figu- rative form, were undertaken as recently as the mid to late Holocene, overlapping with the period of figurative paintings. As Cole et al. (1995:148) have further noted, 'stylistic affinities between this engraving and painted dingoes provides additional evidence for the overlap between the two rock art techniques'. In some areas, such as the Mitchell River and Bonney Glen Station, paintings of dogs are relatively common. In many areas, including Laura, they are often incorpo- rated within larger painted panels. In some sites, such as Magnificent Gallery and Death Adder near Laura, paint- ings of dogs are superimposed by large numbers of figu- rative paintings, including anthropomorphs, echidnas, lizards/crocodiles and flying foxes (Cole et al. 1995: figs. 13.4a &amp; 13.4c). The implication is that it is not only the individual dog paintings that must be less than 4000-3500 years old, but also the broader panels of which they are a part. Thirdly, animals (and items of material culture) imported into Australia from Europe occur in some regions, including Laura (e.g. pigs, horses, letters of the alphabet, anthropomorphs in European clothing), the Mitchell-Palmer (pig), Bonney Glen Station (horse) and Princess Charlotte Bay and the Flinders Island group (e.g. ships), indicating continuity of tradition into very recent times. This does not mean that most of the indi- vidual paintings found in SE Cape York need date to the last 200 years, but that the painting traditions which included these pictures continued until this time. In situ ochres Thirty painted caves and rockshelters have been exca- vated, radiocarbon dated and published from SE Cape York. All of these have revealed the presence of strati- fied ochre fragments in the ground. In some sites, pig- ments occur since earliest times, including Sandy Creek 1 where two use- worn fragments of ochre were found in levels dated to around 32,000 BP (Morwood et al., 1995). The precise timing of peak ochre deposition rates varies site by site, and in some cases there is more than one peak. In every painted site excavated, however, peak rates are evident sometime during the last 3500 years, especially during the last 2000 years (see David &amp; Chant, 1995, and David &amp; Lourandos, 1998, in press, for site details). At Ngarrabullgan Cave, a paint palette was also found just above charcoal dated to 3990±70 (OZB 090). In many sites, ochre is found only in mid to late Holocene levels (e.g. Mordor Cave, Lookout Shelter, Painted Ell, Initiation Cave, Kookaburra Rock, Dragonfly Hollow, Mitchell River Cave, Giant Horse Gallery, Ngarrabullgan Cave). This is despite the fact that approximately half the excavated sites also possess earlier deposits, often extending into the Pleistocene (see Cole et al. 1995; David &amp; Chant, 1995; David &amp; Lourandos, 1997, 1998, in press; Morwood &amp; Hobbs, 1995 for further details). It is such observations that has led Flood (1987:117) to argue for 'the flowering of the Koolburra stencil and painting art' after 2500 years ago. Superimpositions Patterns of superimposition consistently show paintings over patinated peckings, but never the reverse. At Jowalbinna near Laura, Cole et al. (1995:149) report 'at least 15 examples ... in which paintings occur over engravings', but 'no cases ... in which deeply pecked engravings overlie paintings'. In the Koolburra Plateau, Flood and Horsfall (1986:26) report that 'all the rock paintings at Green Ant Shelter seem fresh and overlie the engravings'. Flood (1987:95-96) further notes that while paintings have been seen to occur over peckings, no examples of engravings over pigment art have been recorded. In the Mitchell-Palmer region, David and Chant (1995:465) report that 'the only cases of paintings and [patinated] peckings occurring in superimposition are at Hearth Cave, where paintings are repeatedly placed over peckings'. David and David (1988) report no obvious patterns of change in motif form through time following an exami- 107</page><page sequence="6">nation of superimpositions among paintings at Ootan, Chillagoe, Mungana and Rookwood. Similarly, Cole et al (1995:149) note for the Laura paintings that 'analysis of superimpositions in the Jowalbinna data . . . shows no correlation between attributes such as motif, form, dimensions and position in the sequence'. David (per- sonal observation) likewise sees no clear-cut motif changes through time for the Mitchell-Palmer region via superimpositions. However, both at Laura and in the Mitchell-Palmer there are hints that an early painting tra- dition, distinct from the predominantly figurative tradi- tions that today characterise these regions, may once have existed. At Jowalbinna Cole et al (1995:149) note that 'stylistically different paintings covered by mineral deposits have been recorded at Red Lady, Echidna People, Magnificent Gallery, and Kennedy River'. Unfortunately, we are not told what these 'stylistically different paintings' look like. However, the fact that human occupation at Magnificent Gallery is known to have begun sometime before 10,250±90 BP (SUA-2876) (Morwood &amp; Jung, 1995) allows for a considerable period of time for artistic change. In the Mitchell-Palmer region, the only cases of superimposition involving non- figurative and figurative paintings have the former underlying the latter. In this case, barred, irregular ovals are superimposed by a painted anthropomorph typical of the paintings of the region. The underlying non-figura- tive paintings are, like the Magnificent Gallery old paint- ings, covered by mineral crusts, lending further support to their greater antiquity than the superimposing figura- tive paintings. Fragile pigments In many parts of SE Cape York, fragile pigments have been used for painting. This is the case especially of brown mud and white clays (in particular kaolinite). In all regions to the south of the Mitchell and Walsh Rivers, white is very common, as we have already noted, accounting for more than one quarter of the paintings. That this pigment has survived suggests a relatively young age for much of the art of these regions. While less common to the north, fragile white kaolinite and brown mud pigments also account for many paintings - around one in 10 - executed in similar artistic conven- tions as the paintings found in other colours. Again, the implication is that the painting traditions of each region have an antiquity which continues late into history (con- trast this situation, for example, with the oldest paintings of Arnhem Land and the Kimberley, where white pig- ments are almost entirely absent). AMS dates of lazer-ablated samples: pigments in microstratified rock cortex Recently, a number of researchers have attempted to bet- ter understand the antiquity of SE Cape York's rock-art by obtaining AMS determinations on carbon-bearing compounds closely associated with pigment art. One method, developed by Watchman (e.g. 1993), aims to reveal the presence of ancient pigments now buried above and/or beneath laminae within the rock cortex, and to extract datable materials by lazer- ablating adjacent carbon-bearing layers for AMS dating. Such methods of micro-excavation have enabled the acquisition of sequences of dates, giving envelopes of time (minimum and maximum ages) for artistic events (such coloured pigments have been interpreted as anthropogenic; we do not contest this interpretation here, although in some cases doubts still exist). In perhaps the best example of this technique, a sequence of 10 radiocarbon determina- tions was obtained from a 2.1mm-thick gypsum-oxalate crust from Walkunder Arch Cave. All dates were in sequence, the oldest (29,700±500 BP, OZA 390) near the base of the crust and the youngest (3340±60 BP, OZA 399) near the present rock surface (Campbell et al, 1996) (see below for implications of results). These internatlly consistent results offer confidence to the indi- vidual dates as well as to the technique as a whole. However, since the pigment has only been revealed in cross-section, we do not know if it relates to paintings or stencils or to some other form of pigment art. Nor do we know the shapes of the motifs. So far this method has been applied to two regions only, Laura and Chillagoe. At Laura, Watchman has found traces of pigment in rock cortex from a number of sites. At Yam Camp, two radiocarbon dates around 730 BP (see below) provide a minimum age for underlying pigment art (Cole et al, 1995:155). At Sandy Creek 2, AMS determinations indicate the presence of haematite 24,600±220 BP (NZA 2559), -16-15,000 BP, and 6655±80 BP (AA 7723) (Cole et al, 1995:156). At Sandy Creek 1, laminae possessing traces of red pigment have been dated to shortly before 2810±150 BP (NZA 1206), while a layer of yellow pigment was dated to &gt;2850±115 BP (AA 9222) at Quinkan B6 Rocksheiter (Colera/., 1995:156). At Walkunder Arch Cave (Chillagoe), Watchman and Campbell (1996), Campbell and Mardaga-Campbell (1993), Campbell et al (1996) and Watchman and Hatte (1996:90-91) have reported earth pigments dating to 28,100±400 BP (OZA 391), 16,100±130 BP (OZA 395) and 6790±70 BP (OZA 398) (red haematite), yellow goethite (25,800±280 BP, OZA 392; 22,800±210 BP, OZA 393), and one layer of white clay embedded in lam- inated rock cortex. These have been interpreted as pig- ment art. In another part of the cave, Campbell et al (1996:233) report a maximum AMS date of 9470±120 BP (NZA 2574) 'for a painting [read pigment art?] which has been obscured by crustal growth' (see also Wachman &amp; Hatte, 1996). The pigment art (painting, stencil or print) must therefore be younger than this. These results strongly imply that the creation of pigment art - paintings, stencils and/or prints - was undertaken before 3500 BP. They are an important line of evidence to the emerging chronology of north Queensland's rock 108</page><page sequence="7">art, indicating that pigment art (of undetermined tech- nique) did not suddenly begin during the mid to late Holocene, but has a much older antiquity. Direct AMS dates on paintings Apart for the Chillagoe dates discussed below, direct AMS dates are only available for two paintings currently exposed on rock walls, both from Yam Camp, Laura (Watchman &amp; Cole, 1992). The determinations, of 725±115 (AA 7679) and 730±75 (AA 7719), were undertaken on plant fibres (probably brush filaments) incorporated within the earth pigments. Discussion on the antiquity of paintings If these lines of argument are reliable, they imply that painting activity in SE Cape York dates largely to the last 3500 years BP, and especially to the last 2000 BP, although older pigment art clearly also took place, as indicated by Watchman's research on microstratification of rock cortex. One implication of this contrast between late regional painting traditions and earlier homogeneous peckings (and possibly paintings) is that the process of artistic régionalisation itself is relatively recent, not exceeding 3500 BP and coming into full force especially during the last 2000 years. It is, therefore, not just the art that is being dated, but the very geographical structure of the archaeological record. Some of the implications of this trend have already been discussed elsewhere (David &amp; Chant, 1995; David &amp; Lourandos, 1998). However, few AMS radiocarbon dates have ever been obtained on the art, those that have usually simply identifying the presence of pigment in cross-section. In such cases we know neither the technique (painting, stencil, print) nor the general or specific form of the art (figurative, non- figurative). The purported late antiquity of SE Cape York's cave paintings therefore remains to be tested, in the process also testing the validity of the suggested régionalisation model. In the following pages we there- fore present new AMS radiocarbon dates directly under- taken on paintings from the Chillagoe-Mungana- Rookwood limestone belt. The prediction previously made (David &amp; Chant, 1995), based on the above lines of circumstantial evidence, is that the (regionalised) paintings should mostly date to the last 3500 BP, and to the last 2000 years BP especially. The rock-art of Chillagoe-Mungana-Rookwood The Chillagoe-Mungana-Rookwood limestone belt con- sists of a string of isolated towers, ranging from a few metres to over lkm in length. The tallest of these rise approximately 100 m above the surrounding landscape. Each tower is littered with caves and rockshelters, some of which possess rock-art near their entrances. Art is almost never found in the dark chambers not reached by sunlight (but see Watchman &amp; Hatte, 1996). The rock paintings consist almost entirely of non-figu- rative designs. Predominant motifs include grids, radiat- ing lines (including star-shapes), geometric figures (including circles), sets of lines and other simple linear designs (David &amp; David, 1988). The AMS dating program Recently, we began a long-term research project aimed at dating the rock paintings of the Chillagoe-Mungana- Rookwood limestone belt and nearby Ootan. Our pri- mary aims were to test and refine the above coarse- grained temporal model for SE Cape York rock-art. With this in mind, we decided to start by sampling a number of charcoal paintings, as AMS determinations on char- coal were believed to be less difficult to interpret then on other sources of carbon. We decided not to attempt to extract potentially existing organic binders, such as blood or plant extracts, from paintings during the early stages of this project, as extraction protocols had not yet been firmly established and technical limitations may have rendered results difficult to interpret. Eighteen charcoal paintings were therefore sampled by scraping small amounts of charcoal into aluminium foil envelopes, which were then sealed in individual plastic bags. This procedure was followed for each sam- ple except for the initial seven samples, where alu- minium foil envelopes were not used (Armitage et ai, 1998; David et al., in press). A new, sterile scalpel blade was used for each scraping. New latex gloves were worn during collection of each sample and when handling the foil to prevent contamination. Some paintings were sam- pled twice so as to enable individual results to be tested by multiple dates or via the use of different preparation techniques (see below). In addition, a charcoal graffito from Echidna's Rest was also sampled to enable a further assessment of the technique, the assumption being that the radiocarbon determination should be no older then the age of charcoal readily available on the present cave floor. The preparation (chemistry) protocols employed are described in the Appendix. The radiocarbon results are shown in Table 1. Filtrate samples provided additional results from some samples prepared by the Texas A&amp;M team (see Armitage et al., 1998 for details). Large uncertainties reflect the poor sta- tistical precision resulting from the low output (14C counts and 13C current) of small samples. We emphasise that the dates listed in Table 1 are dates for the charcoal; as always in archaeology, the charcoal age does not nec- essarily date the archaeological event desired, in this case the time of painting of the motif (the Old wood' and 'old charcoal' problems). However, in the Chillagoe region we would argue that while it is possible that old charcoal was picked-up from ancient floor surfaces rather than created afresh for rock drawing, the Old wood problem' - that the wood was old before burning 109</page><page sequence="8">Picture description Site name Laboratory # Original Mass of C Sample Radiocarbon and number mass (mg) as a percentage preparation date (BP) of original mass (chemistry) Barred outlined Echidna's Rest OZA576 56.4 0.44 ANSTO Modern design (site 56) Infilled geometric Echidna's Rest OZA577 127.8 0.78 ANSTO Modern design (circle) (site 56) Infilled geometric Echidna's Rest OZA578 55.7 0.45 ANSTO Modern design (circle) (site 56) Irregular lines Echidna's Rest OZA579 36.0 0.39 ANSTO Modern (site 56) Elongated, Echidna's Rest OZA573 30.9 0.49 ANSTO 400±60 net-like grid (site 56) Barred outlined Echidna's Rest OZA575 75.9 0.66 ANSTO 440±55 design (site 56) 2 concentric ovals (site 55) OZC441 32.3 0.37 Texas A&amp;M 530±105 with internal circle barred 3 concentric arcs (site 55) OZC440 38.7 0.26 Texas A&amp;M 620±170 meeting at 1 end Elongated, Echidna's Rest OZA574 32.4 0.77 ANSTO 840±70 net-like grid (site 56) Striped, irregular, (site 55) OZD423 Texas A&amp;M 1000±120 partly enclosed elongated design Elongated, striped (site 55) OZC 853 Texas A&amp;M 1150+90 tapering oval Sub-parallel lines (site 62) OZB 586+ 263.0* 0.04 Texas A&amp;M 1220±220 OZB765 (averaged) Elongated grid (site 55) OZC 438 38.7 0.08 Texas A&amp;M 1750±180 Irregular lines Racecourse Site NZA2738 NZA 2056±81 (site 59) Irregular, elongated, (site 55) OZC 852 Texas A&amp;M 2080(100 curved comb-shaped design Star-shape with (site 75) OZB 587+ 66.4 0.16 Texas A&amp;M 2500±250 7 radiating lines OZB 782 (averaged) 2 concentric arcs (site 55) OZC 439 Texas A&amp;M 3330±440 Star-shape with MunganaSite OZB 783 19.4 0.15 Texas A&amp;M 3350±350 14 radiating lines (site 2) Table 1.

Once dead, plant material (including wood) does not last very long on the ground (a maximum of tens of years), given the tropical nature of the area and the activity of termites. Therefore, the difference between the age of the archaeological event and the time of burning of the wood may be of a few hundred years, but it is even more likely to be of the order of tens of years only, given that the vast majority of tree species last only a few decades in this tropical, termite-ridden environment. The dated graffito The sampled graffito from Echidna's Rest came from the words 'Mr. C.B. Ross', written in charcoal (Fig. 2).

It is therefore assumed that the charcoal graffito sampled for AMS dating was done in or around 1894. Near-surface charcoal from Echidna's Rest was sam- pled by David (1990), revealing a radiocarbon date of 690±90 BP (ANU 4812). Other radiocarbon determina- tions, dating to 1470±170 BP (ANU 5154), were also obtained on charcoal from the depth of the treadage zone in some parts of the cave (top 10 cm of deposit) (David, 1990:79).

The AMS date on 'Mr. C.B. Ross' is 1310±460 BP (OZC 437). Given its similarity to the age of charcoal found near the ground surface, this result does not place in question our ability to AMS date charcoal paintings at Echidna's Rest. 112</page><page sequence="11">440±55bp(OZA575) À?

The paintings sampled for dating The paintings reported here include 17 which came from the Chillagoe-Mungana-Rookwood limestone outcrops, and one from a granite boulder near Ootan (sample OZB 587+OZB 782) located a few kilometres to the south of Chillagoe. All of the readily accessible charcoal paint- ings were sampled; all radiocarbon determinations obtained so far are presented below. Other charcoal paintings are currently awaiting AMS dating. The dated paintings include examples of each of the major motif categories: star-shapes (e.g. Fig. 3), grids and barred enclosed designs (Figs. 2, 4-9), geometric shapes (Figs 10-11) and other simple linear forms (Figs 7 &amp; 12). They come from six sites (Table 1), spanning various parts of the Chillagoe-Mungana-Rookwood limestone belt and Ootan. In some cases, the sampled paintings are subimposed underneath other (undated) paintings, in which case they give a maximum date for the overlying art. In other cases, two paintings lying in superimposition are each dated. The overlying painting should be younger than that underlying it, offering an independent test of the dating method itself. Results The results of the dating program are presented in Table 1. As predicted by the existing chronological model, the paintings returned radiocarbon determinations less than 3500 BP.

Furthermore, most of the radiocarbon determinations pertain to the last 2000 years, again as predicted by the chronological model (see Armitage et al., 1998 and David et al., in press for discussions of dat- ing and chemistry procedures on individual samples). These results show no obvious temporal ordering by motif forms. This is not surprising, as previous analyses of superimpositions had revealed no significant patterns (David &amp; David, 1988). Rather, the entire set of motifs appear to pertain to the entire period of time covered by the paintings. These observations are not questioned by the present results. The overlying paintings The painting represented by sample OZC423 lies under- neath that represented by OZC440. It should, therefore, be older or of similar age. This is borne-out by the results, with the underlying painting dated to 1000±120 BP, and the overlying one to 620±170 BP. A number of red and white paintings are superim- posed over the dated ones. Like the vast majority of paintings from this region, they are all non-figurative in form. The superimposed paintings are presented in Figures 13-14, and by definition must post-date the underlying, dated charcoal pictures. In addition, a faded red painting, probably an anthro- pomorph, lies underneath OZC853. It therefore dates around or before 1 150±90 BP. Discussion It has now been 18 years since Andrée Rosenfeld pro- posed that figurative motifs and intensive painting activ- ity first began in SE Cape York 5-4000 years ago at the earliest. Although closely investigated by various archae- ologists and rock-art specialists, and while aspects have been refined, her general chronological model remains unchallenged to this day. The new results presented in 114</page><page sequence="13">i/í//// I» ·Μ 1 (j i ' ' ». Tí O 5 i 1 4 V * 1 V ι cm © * Vi Λ! Figure 9. Painting sampled as OZC 853, from Chillagoe- Mungana-Rookwood site 55. this paper, aimed at testing aspects of Rosenfeld's chronology, add further weight to her views. It could be argued, however, that the increased rates of cortex development after -3000 BP found by Alan Watchman and his co-workers at Chillagoe and Laura signal a masking of earlier cave paintings by mineral crusts. If this was the case, the apparent change from non-figurative to figurative motifs during the mid Holocene could be a taphonomic illusion. However, we would argue against this for the following reasons: 1 . Increases in rates of cortex formation after -3000 BP suggest an increased incidence of air-born particles subsequently adhering to rock surfaces. Watchman et al. (in press) have elsewhere argued that such evidence may indicate increasing anthropogenic disturbance of the landscape through burning. Such trends are consistent with the independent archaeological evidence for increasing intensities of site and regional land use throughout SE Cape York at this time, including increased intensities of painting activity (David &amp; Chant, 1995; David &amp; Lourandos, 1998). 2. Commencement of a predominantly figurative artis- tic tradition to the north of the Mitchell and Walsh Rivers during the mid Holocene is evident amongst both paint- ings and engravings. Figurative motifs, including dogs, occur only among poorly patinated peckings in caves and rockshelters. 0 5 &gt; r· Figure 10. Painting sampled as OZA 577, from Chillagoe-Mungana-Rookwood site 56. 3. The circumstantial dating evidence used to create the chronological model in the first place had indicated that paintings were of a mid to late Holocene antiquity. Such evidence included the timing of major increases in ochre deposition rates within all excavated sites. 'Direct' AMS determinations on paintings were not used to cre- ate the original chronological model tested in this paper. While pigment art was undoubtedly made before the mid Holocene (as is apparent in Watchman's microstrati- graphic cortex sections), evidence from superimpositions in some regions (e.g. Mitchell-Palmer) also hint at a change in motif forms, from non-figurative to figurative paintings (consistent with the evidence from the pati- nated to unpatinated peckings). That the régionalisation model was built entirely on circumstantial dating evi- dence - direct AMS dates on painted walls were not then available - implies that the former can now be tested by the latter as independent evidence. We there- fore suggest that socio-cultural, rather than taphonomic, interpretations for this change in rock-art practices are valid (see David, in press a). This paper has aimed to review, test and refine Andrée Rosenfeld's chronology for north Queensland's rock-art. It finds support for her original temporal model, indicating the emergence of intensive painting activity after around 3500 BP, as well as the less frequent, but none-the-less occurring, older pigment art. Yet in writing this paper, we originally aimed to find inconsistencies in the pre-existing chronological data; to find problematic dates that could justifiably be rejected, individual or systemic problems that necessitated a re-assessment of the existing, published data. But we did not find such problems (unlike the case with the radiocarbon dates from the excavated sites - see 115</page><page sequence="14">O I CM .' .*&gt; .τ*". • · % · Figure 11. Painting sampled as OZA 578, from Chillagoe-Mungana-Rookwood site 56. David and Chant [1995] for a review). Each line of evi- dence revealed its own, internally consistent patterns (see also Watchman et al., in press). The types of inconsisten- cies encountered in the 'direct' AMS dating of Sydney Sandstone Basin pigment art by McDonald et al. (1990), or systematic laboratory errors such as those elsewhere reported by Spriggs (1989), or internal contradictions such as those reported by Anderson and Clark (1999) for the age of Lapita in Fiji, were not encountered. This is, we suspect, at least partly a result of the relative recency of all the radiocarbon dating programs reported here (late 1980s onwards) leading to some degree of methodological con- sistency, and the small number of dates yet obtained. It may also be partly due to the extreme caution exhibited by the few specialists and laboratories who have attempted to pre-treat and/or date samples in what are still treated largely as experimental techniques - Watchman, Rowe's Texas A&amp;M team, ANSTO, and the University of Arizona laboratories in particular. Also, it must not be forgotten that we are dealing with fairly broad time-frames (the last 3500 years BP as a single block of time); this helps enor- mously when dealing with issues of this kind, for potential minor errors in dating are not at stake. In this sense, our interpretations are constrained by a coarse chronology. But this has been a necessary state of affairs, one that can now only be transcended because of the groundwork set by Andrée Rosenfeld in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Dating protocols: sample preparation and chemistry Rock-art samples were collected in the field by BD and MWR. Photographs were taken before and after sample removal. Particular care was taken to keep the visual effects of sampling to a minimum. The sampled powder was a mixture of limestone (CaCO3) substrate, charcoal pigment and overlying accretion. All samples except for NZA 2738 and OZA 573-579 were enclosed in alu- minium foil, sealed in a zipper-seal polyethlene bag and labeled. The exceptions were placed straight into zip- per-seal polyethlene bags and labeled, by-passing the aluminium foil stage. Some samples were then taken to the plasma-chemical laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University for preparation, while others were sent straight to ANSTO's ANTARES AMS radiocarbon lab- oratory for chemistry and dating. A single sample (NZA 2738) was prepared and dated at the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences Limited in New Zealand via the NWG Macintosh Centre for Quaternary Dating in Sydney. Analytical Procedure: the Texas A&amp;M University method The samples taken by MWR to the Texas A&amp;M University were photographed under magnification and weighed after foreign matter was removed. They were prepared following the standard NaOH treatment to remove humic acids (Ilger et al. 1995, 1996; Armitage et al. 1998; and references therein). This procedure has been followed both here and in other rock-art dating pro- jects by the Texas A&amp;M team, irrespective of whether pigments are charcoal or inorganic. Rock painting sam- ples are routinely treated with NaOH, with ultrasonica- tion for ~1 hour at ~50°C. We filter the NaOH wash through binder-free, borosilicate-glass filters that were baked at ~600°C. Humic acids present stay in solution, passing through the glass filter. Plasma extractions are performed on dried filtrate material. Radio frequency generated, low-temperature (~150°C), low-pressure (~1 torr) oxygen plasmas ensure that the reaction chamber is free of organic material before insertion of a sample. Argon is flowed through the chamber as a sample is placed inside to reduce introduc- tion of atmospheric CO2 into the plasma chamber. The chamber is evacuated to -IO"4 torr after a sample is loaded and then filled with -0.2 torr ultra-high purity argon. Argon plasmas are run on each sample to remove adsorbed CO2 by inelastic collision of the unreactive, but energetic argon atoms and ions. We repeat this process until the amount of CO2 desorbed by the plasma is equivalent to &lt;1 μg carbon. That has a negligible effect on an age estimate. Following the final argon plasma, the chamber is pumped to ~10~7 torr. Vacuum pumps are then closed and pressure rise is recorded for an hour or more to mon- itor air leakage into the plasma chamber; no significant leaks were ever found. With these precautions, only neg- ligible amounts (&lt;1 μ g carbon) of adsorbed CO2 are released from the system or sample surfaces during car- bon extraction from a rock painting sample. We then use another oxygen-plasma to remove organic matter in the paint leaving the substrate rock and carbonate/oxalate accretions intact. Plasma conditions were similar for all samples. CO2 produced from the pigment is collected and its pressure measured after the H2O produced in the plasma reaction is removed by freezing. CO2 is then frozen at -194°C, sealed into a glass finger, and sent to the ANSTO AMS facility for 14C analysis. Analytical Procedure: the ANSTO method Samples derived from charcoal were prepared in a con- ventional manner at the ANTARES AMS Centre of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. AAA pre-treatment removed possible contamination from carbonates, fulvic and humic acids. Combustion was performed in a sealed tube at 900°C for four hours in the presence of pre-cleaned CuO. A portion of the CO2 was collected for 13C determination on a stable isotope mass spectrometer. The remaining CO2 was reduced to graphite at 600°C using a Fe catalyst in the presence of Zn (held at 400°C), the process lasting from six to 10 hours. The mixture of graphite (1 to 1.5 mg) and iron (~1 mg) was loaded into aluminium cathodes for 14C measurement on the accelerator. Samples received from the plasma laboratory at the Texas A&amp;M University were in the form of CO2 in breakseal vials. The CO2 was graphitised in a small (3 mL) graphitisation vessel in order to obtain pressures high enough to allow the reduction process to proceed efficiently. Blanks were prepared at the plasma labora- tory from 14C-free graphite supplied by the ANTARES AMS Centre. After graphitisation these indicated that the plasma combustion process added a negligible amount of modern carbon. Measurement The samples were measured on the FN tandem accelera- tor. The accelerator uses SF6 insulating gas, Dowlish accelerator tubes, Pelletron charging and a gas stripper. Measurements of 14C were made at 5.2 MV using a 59-sample ion source and fast isotope cycling. In general samples were measured at least once for a minimum of 200 seconds, but three measurements were commonly made on modern and near-modern samples to obtain good precision. A conservative estimate was taken for the precision by selecting the larger of the Poisson preci- sion and the standard error. Corrections were applied for the machine background (at least 55,000 years) and for the contamination introduced in the preparation of the graphite target. 118</page><page sequence="17">Acknowledgements We thank Meredith Wilson and Ursula Frederick for the opportunity to write this paper; the people of Chillagoe, particularly Rita Maddigan, William Johnston, Daphne Brumby and Lana Little, for permission and assistance in undertaking this work; Gary Swinton, Department Geography and Environmental Science (GES) at Monash University for drawing Figure 1; GES and Monash University for awarding BD a Logan Fellowship for this research; Earthwatch and the Earthcorps (1995-7) for assisting with fieldwork; the US National Center for Preservation Training and Technology for partial support for the Texas A&amp;M University laboratory; and most of all Andrée Rosenfeld for her past and continued inspira- tion and friendship.
