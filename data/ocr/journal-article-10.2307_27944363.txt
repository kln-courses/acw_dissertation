<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theology of Spirit: Personalist Idealism, Neis F. S. Ferr?, and the Universal Word Gary Dorrien / Union Theological Seminary The personalist school of theology, like the evangelical liberal tradition with which it was connected, declined precipitously in the 1960s, and for some of the same reasons. In its third generation, approximately 1945 to 1965, the school of personalist idealism centered at Boston University featured an important social ethicist, Walter Muelder; an equally accomplished philosopher, Peter Bertocci; and two able theologians, L. Harold DeWolf and S. Paul Schilling. The third generation personalists, however, were not as intellectually creative as their teachers, Edgar Brightman and Albert Knudson, and more importantly, they did not replace themselves. In the 1960s, while process theology became an important school, the personalist school faded from view, despite its connection to Martin Luther King, Jr. Personalist theology in its fourth generation had no prominent theorists, and thus it lost intellectual energy and convicting influence. The downward trend was not immediately obvious. Muelder, Bertocci, DeWolf, and Schilling remained active in the 1960s, and they took pride in their influence on King. Yet personalism faded just as King became a world-historical figure. Personalist idealism was fundamentally a metaphysical theory of personality, but the dominant movements in American philosophy were anti-metaphysical: linguistic philosophy, existentialism, pragmatism, and empiricism. The personalists were further handicapped by an idealistic approach to nature, unlike the Whiteheadians, who at least had realism on their side. Moreover, Brightman's system of universal moral laws deeply influenced Muelder, DeWolf, and Bertocci, but it made personalist idealism seem quaint to a succeeding generation that emphasized social context and history. The third generation personalists had the unenviable task of refashioning the most attractive parts of German idealism after it fell out of fashion. Personalism was a theology of spiritual personality, but it might have been more compelling and long-lasting as a theology of personal spirit. Instead of defining the spiritual in terms of the personal and the moral, the personalist theologians and philosophers might have</page><page sequence="2">4 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy done better to define the personal and the moral in terms of the spiritual. That was the view of theologian Neis F. S. Ferr?, whose complex and distinctive theology was essentially personalist but never quite of the personalist school, and who never won the standing that he deserved. Neis F. S. Ferr? and the Spirit of Divine Love els Fredrik Solomon Ferr? was born in 1908 in Lulea, Sweden, to L Maria Wickman Ferr?, a deeply pious, loving, and irrepressible mother, and Frans August Ferr?, a stern, fundamentalist father and leading pastor of the conservative Swedish Baptist church. His birth name was Nils. As a youth he anguished over his father's insistence that God condemns to eternal damnation all who do not believe in Jesus; Nils took comfort in his mother's quiet belief that God gives unregenerate souls a "second chance" after death. At the age of thirteen he emigrated to the U.S. to obtain an education. His seventeen-year-old brother George had emigrated to Minnesota the year before, and despite his brother's plea to remain in Sweden, Nils joined him. Years later, to his children, Ferr? often told the story of his departure from Sweden. Tearfully he had waved goodbye to his parents, brothers, and sisters while the train pulled away, but glancing back for a last look, he saw his mother running frantically alongside the train. Ferr? opened the window and heard his mother call to him, "Nils, remember Jesus! Remember Jesus!" 1 In the U.S. he was detained on Ellis Island, joined his brother in St. Paul, Minnesota, and worked for his keep with a farming family. Reluctantly, Ferr? accepted a teacher's decree that he was now to be called Neis. When Ferr? was sixteen his family emigrated to 1 Thyra Ferr? Bj?rn, "The Wonderful Arrival of Nils," 1-2.

Winning a scholarship to Boston University, he studied under Edgar Brightman and dropped his fundamentalism. Brightman later recalled: "I recognized him as a man of native gifts in the field of philosophy, a remarkably quick and logical mind, and a brilliant discusser." At a more personal level Ferr? was influenced by the religious liberalism of his fianc?, classmate Katharine Pond, the daughter of a Boston physician, who was an unlikely match for him. His upbringing had been hard-pressed, dramatic, and militantly evangelical; hers had been privileged, staid, and cultured. Often they discussed religion, and in his junior year Ferr? resolved to accept no belief on the basis of external authority. Intellectually and emotionally he flourished at Boston University. In 1931 he graduated as class valedictorian and enrolled at Andover Newton Theological School; the following year he and Katharine married. For the rest of his life he stressed that she was his most important teacher: "My wife's liberal theology centered in constructive and forgiving good will. I pitied her faith; she loved me into newness of life." 2 Ferr? was fond of saying that he was the product of three conversions. The first was to conservative orthodoxy, at the age of twelve; the second was to intellectual honesty, during college; the third was to "the love of God and man," during seminary. At Andover Newton his chief influences were the books he read on his own, especially George A. Gordon's My Education and Religion. Ferr? never doubted his father's stern admonition that God is severe, but Gordon convinced him that even God's judgment and severity are aspects of the divine love. God uses freedom and suffering to fulfill God's purpose of bringing human subjects into loving union with God's self. 3 After graduating from Andover Newton in 1934 Ferr? was ordained to the Congregational ministry, served briefly as a pastor, and undertook doctoral studies at Harvard, where he served as a graduate assistant to Alfred North Whitehead. He spent a year in Sweden on a 2 Bj?rn, "The Wonderful Arrival of Nils," 2-15; Edgar S. Brightman, "Report to Guggenheim Foundation on Neis Ferr?," October 1939, Edgar S.

Eleven years later Ferr? recalled that he tacked back and forth between liberal theology and neo-orthodoxy until he realized that neither tradition adequately appreciated the primacy of the Holy Spirit in Christian life. That was his mainstay: the transforming power of God's Spirit as the spirit of love. In 1937 he joined the faculty of Andover Newton, where two years later, at the age of thirty-one, he was appointed to the oldest endowed chair of theology in the United States, the Abbott Professorship of Systematic Theology, and where his first tenure lasted thirteen years. 4 From the beginning he wrote prolifically in an intensely earnest, personal, and sometimes cheeky style, often oscillating between opaque abstractions and vividly direct prose, and his central theme was that love is the ultimate category of reality because God is love. Early in Ferr?'s career he settled on the view that the agape-motif of the Lundensian school recovered the key to Christianity and cosmic truth. His first book, Swedish Contributions to Modern Theology (1939), described Christianity as the revelation "that God is spontaneous, unmotivated, value-indifferent love creative of fellowship." Human eros is self-centered desire, Ferr? argued, but divine agap? is unconditional, unmotivated, self-giving love. Agap? is the essence of the divine nature; it shatters all legalistic and rationalistic understandings of religion; and all true statements about God's power, holiness, or anything else are fundamentally about God's love. Ferr?'s version of agap? theology was warmer and more ethically-oriented than the austere Lutheranism of the Lundensians. He corrected the churchly dualism of Aul?n and Anders Nygren by insisting that divine love "must in some way be organically related to the whole of man, the whole of history, and the whole of nature." The Lundensians emphasized the faith of the church, but Ferr? stressed personal experience, especially what he later called the "Event-Meaning" of Christ as divine love and truth.5 4 Ferr?, "Beyond Liberalism and Neo-Orthodoxy," 363; Bjorn, 'The Wonderful Arrival of Nils," 15-17; David Wesley Soper, Major Voices in American Theology: Six Contemporary Leaders (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1953), 74-77. 3 Neis F.

The pain was so crippling that his students sometimes had to carry him into class. His overweening ambition, however, alienated faculty colleagues. "I felt too free to correct my colleagues," he later recalled. "Exploding with ideas, I talked too much. I wanted to be accepted, but the more I tried to prove myself worthy of belonging, the less welcome I was." He found greater acceptance in the classroom, sitting on the edge of his desk to lecture. Ferr?'s brilliant intellect and personality made him an unforgettable teacher. Though he was feared as a grader, his personal asides were irresistible to seminarians, he radiated spiritual sincerity, and he could be vulnerably forward on the topic of suffering. To Brightman he confided that his poor health was turning him into a recluse. Later he recalled that "my wife and family are the heroes of those strange years." Katharine Ferr? nursed his constant ailments and typed his books; Brightman became a trusted friend, cautioning him against reading too much; and gradually Ferr? came to the view that God used his suffering to cure him of presumption, insecurity, and aggressiveness: "Without sentimentality he took away my health and gave me years of pain, of constant physical handicap. Never can I stop thanking God for the purgatorial fire of those years. In them God's severity became personally accepted as goodness, and part of the process of conversion was actually effected." 6 Ferr?'s essentially liberal theology retained a strong evangelical flavor; buoyantly he urged his students to pray for and expect a bright new age of the Spirit. In 1939 he told Brightman that although his position was "thoroughly liberal," he had doubts about the "mood and method of liberalism." The following year he called for a spiritually renewed evangelical liberalism. Liberal theology needed to reclaim the reality of divine love as the absolute basis of Christian conviction, he argued. Having begun as a gospel-centered theology that used history and reason to win its freedom, liberalism had degenerated into "an apology for the possession of that freedom" without its evangelical "Event-Meaning," 54; Gustaf Aul?n, The Faith of the Christian Church, trans.

Brightman, 15 March 1943; Brightman to Ferr?, 4 April 1943, Brightman Papers, Boston University.</page><page sequence="6">8 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy elements. Liberal theology no longer exuded the joyful liberation of the Ritschlian school because liberals didn't know what to do with their freedom. It lacked inspiring convictions because they were soaked in relativism. Ferr? countered that liberals needed to give up their shyness about possessing absolute convictions: "Religiously we can unreservedly accept Jesus as God and Savior if with that is meant that Jesus truly revealed the nature and will of God to create by the Christian Cross a full and free fellowship based on a self-transcending, uncalculating, God-given love." Years later he took back the part about calling Jesus "the Savior." 7 Critical methods are legitimate and necessary, but they do not yield ultimate truths. The truth of God's ever-gracious love is known by grace, Ferr? urged, not method. Because God is the ultimate reality, and God is love, all history and experience are the pedagogy of divine love. Love is the end of life and also the spiritual and ethical means to the divine end. Ferr? poured out books on these themes and waited anxiously for academic renown that was slow to come. Later he reflected that all his life he had to "wait abnormally long" for things he wanted desperately. Some reviewers complained that his opaque speculations and tangent-lurching asides were hard to follow; others were put off by his sweeping dogmatic claims and the burning religious intensity that pervaded his work. Ferr?'s self-description emphasized the latter quality: "I possessed a high, zealous theology and the intensity of spirit to match it." To him, divine agap? was the normative core of biblical faith, the solution to the world's problems, and the core of cosmic truth itself. Ferr? agreed with pragmatic liberals that experience provides the data for religious belief, but cautioned that "average experience" is precisely what needs to be transformed. Theology is about the transformation of the world through the love-transforming power of God's Spirit.8 7 Neis F. S. Ferr? to Edgar S.

Religious truth is always about the instantiation of the good within history. Through the incarnation of God's love in Christ, human beings perceive the trajectory of the creative and infinite love of God retrospectively from the perspective of its telos; Ferr? called this phenomenon the "reflexive superspective." The superspective is the highest spiritual standpoint and the focus of spiritual process; it is reflexive because the process conforms completely to its goal. Appropriating themes from Bergsonian vitalism, existentialism, and Whiteheadian organicism, Ferr? taught that the highest truth within process always consists of that which is most fully good; spiritual reality is rooted individually in personal inwardness and decision; and truth within process is fluid and dynamic. Religious truth is progressively self-verifying, because everything is in process and spirit is self-authenticating.9 His view of the relation of faith and reason was a variation of the personalist theory of functional interdependence. To Ferr?, faith was the conviction that ideality is ultimately more real than the world of everyday actuality, and reason was the critical perception of actuality. Reason perceives what exists and what is possible within actuality; to have faith is to believe that some ideal possesses a deeper reality than average actuality and that this ideal has transformative power. Reason studies the nature of things, while faith is the vision of the ideal and the affirmation of the spiritual truth of this vision. Thus Faith and reason are essentially different, for faith is primarily grounded in ideality and reason in actuality. Yet faith and reason need each other, for without reason, faith is ignorant and blind, and without faith, reason lacks inspired vision and moral concern. 10 Working together, faith and reason disclose the "cosmic swoosh" of God's process of saving the world. Ferr? taught that knowledge and truth are not the same thing, for knowledge always points beyond itself as a point in a moving process, "an actual among actuals." Knowledge is provisional and fragmentary, and the idealizing thrust of faith anticipates truths that are ultimately more real than the totality of the process. Unlike philosophy, which is bound to the actual, 9 Neis F. S. Ferr?, Faith and Reason (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1946), 148-153. 10 Ibid., 217-232.</page><page sequence="8">10 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy theology is ultimately oriented to the "cosmic swoosh" of emergent process. Ferr?'s theodicy emphasized the reflexive superspective. Viewed from any point within the process, God may seem to permit far too much suffering and evil, but the ultimately relevant perspective views the world process from the standpoint of God's saving, universal, loving purpose. Repeatedly Ferr? cautioned that apart from God's consummating telos, theology has no answer to problems concerning natural and moral evil. The world process is a school of salvation, and even our highest ideas of God's loving wisdom, power, and glory pale before the reality to which they point. 11 His governing theme was always the ultimate sovereignty of divine love, which he applied to all theological and ethical topics, sometimes controversially. Ferr? told readers that his chief purpose as an author was to share with them "some of my sense of being overwhelmed by the greatness and goodness of God." His son, religious philosopher Frederick Ferr?, later put it more aptly: "God as agap? revealed in Christ lit up his mind and satisfied his heart." Ferr?'s politics blended Swedish social democracy and the American social gospel, and in his early career he converted to Christian pacifism. In 1950, shortly after assuming the chair of Philosophical Theology at Vanderbilt Divinity School, he examined current social issues from a theological perspective. On the ethics of war Ferr? espoused a distinctly Christian pacifism, while criticizing idealistic and absolute pacifisms. On political economics he advocated a cooperativist form of social democracy, while adding that if economic democracy didn't work, perhaps a "thoroughgoing Christian communism" might be the answer to the ills of capitalist civilization. The Christian church was undeniably "slow and conservative" as a social institution, but it contained the seed of a world-transforming faith in its divine call to become "an unbreakable fellowship in God's love." 12 Vanderbilt Divinity School was not a major seminary in 1950, but it had ambitions of becoming one.

Ferr?'s answer was a light teaching schedule and a secretary. He arrived at Vanderbilt in February, 1950, exulting in his star treatment and the warm hospitality of Vanderbilt colleagues, and his tenure there was highly productive. It was also bitterly embattled, however. Vanderbilt Divinity School was quite public about its desire to shed its backwater image and join Yale, Union, and Chicago as a top ranked institution. Ferr? was its first theological star. His colleagues came to include Langdon Gilkey, Roger L. Shinn, J. Robert Nelson, and Gordon Kaufman, but Ferr? was the pioneer and symbol of Vanderbilt's push for a national reputation, and he paid for it. 13 McCarthy-style anti-communism was in the ascendancy throughout the U.S., and at Vanderbilt fundamentalists had far more influence than anything Ferr? had experienced at Andover Newton. He had barely arrived in Nashville when local preachers began to protest that the divinity school had hired a communist and atheist. His sensitive spirit notwithstanding, Ferr? took the attacks remarkably in stride. He understood the religious anxieties of fundamentalists; often he admonished friends and family that Christians are called to love their enemies; and he never wavered from his conviction that his adopted country needed a strong dose of Swedish-style democratic socialism. At Vanderbilt he wrote a popular book on personal religion that affirmed his gospel center; a major work on God that contained fresh provocations; books on education and practical religion that showed his breadth of interests; and two books that poured gasoline on the fires around him, The Sun and the Umbrella (1953) and Christ and the Christian (1958). The latter book was his swan song from Vanderbilt, published just after he returned to Andover Newton and the Abbott Chair. 14 His major work, The Christian Understanding of God (1951) expounded Ferr?'s thesis that divine love is the "category of categories" for the realms of being and becoming, and that time and eternity are complementary in the symphonic expression of divine love.

Love acts out of pure and total concern for the good, and thus lacks any exact analogy to undirected or determined forms of energy. If God is love, Ferr? reasoned, and love is ultimate, the Christian understanding of God is rightly monistic, dualistic, and pluralistic. It is monistic because God as love constitutes the nature of ultimate being. It is dualistic because if love is ultimate, the ultimate is both self-existing and self-directing energy, and it requires a relational object of concern; God's need to create life and enjoy fellowship shows the strength of God's love, not a weakness. And it is pluralistic in a derivative sense, because time, nature, and the human spirit are all real. Brightman had a tendency to overidentify God with the world process, Ferr? judged, but he was right that time is real, reality is not limited by time, and time has always been and always will be. Love as ultimate being is indivisibly infinite, not a serial phenomenon. The ultimate is inexhaustible, growing infinitely by its free, selective, creative works, and it never exhausts its possibilities or the realm of non-being. 15 With the personalist school Ferr? contended that God is truly personal and the affirmation of God's personality is indispensable to Christian faith. As the fullness of personal outpouring love, God epitomizes the categories of personality: God becomes through genuine other-love, and is therefore perfectly self-transcendent. God knows God's self directly, yet with a creative and redemptive focus that is outside God's self; thus God is perfectly self-conscious. God becomes through the achievement of goals and the bestowal of freedom on God's subjects; thus God is perfectly self-directive. God's love is creative and purposive, and because becoming belongs to the same fundamental level of reality as being, God is (not merely "has") creative purpose. Like Bowne and Knudson, Ferr? emphasized that purpose is constitutive of personal self-being, not merely a means to personality. Like the personalists generally, he conceived the body as a medium of communication, the means by which selves participate in nature and communicate with each other. Understood as the capacity to communicate with other selves, Ferr? reasoned, it is appropriate to speak of God as possessing a body. Though the world is not God's body, God's embodiment interpenetrates the world, eternally creating 15 Ferr?, The Christian Understanding of God, 15-29, 104-105, quote, 104.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 27, No. 1, January 2006 13 and sustaining it. Spirit creates spirit through the communicative medium of embodiment. Thus personality involves not only self transcendence, self-consciousness, self-direction, and creative purpose, but also the selfs desire to perpetuate itself and create loving community. 16 But the personalists, in Ferr?'s view, were strangely weak on the reality of divine personality. They stressed the personality of God, but not personality in God. He gave no examples, but probably had in mind Knudson's guarded discussions of the trinity and his weak concept of the Holy Spirit, as well as the typical personalist lack of a theory of coinherence. To Ferr? it was crucial to conceive love not only as being, becoming, and personality, but also as Spirit. Affirming God as Spirit was the answer to the standard objections to divine personality. Is the idea of divine personality necessarily anthropomorphic? Does it idealize human being, limiting God to human reality within space and time? Is it too selective and dependent on a social environment to represent infinite, ultimate being? Ferr? respected the usual personalist answer, that personalist theory makes God, not human beings, the standard of personality. He told Brightman that he couldn't understand why personality was not more widely accepted as a metaphysical principle, since logos and agap? are merely abstractions "except as contents of Personality." On the other hand he lamented that the personalists failed to emphasize that God is Spirit, existing everywhere in the world without being everything: "It is love as spirit that gives the ultimate cohesiveness to being. It is love as spirit that relates the infinite being and the infinite nonbeing, giving structure one from the other or eliminating structure as one passes into the other." Belonging neither to being nor nonbeing, spirit is the unique means of relation between these incommensurate infinities; it is the union of being and nonbeing. God comes into being, and is, through the spirit, which is the means and power by which all things can be made new. Ferr? wrote: "It is through the spirit that Deity always exceeds in possibility any and every actuality or sum of actualities. It is through the spirit that evil consequences can be canceled; that the past as past can die." 17 16 Ibid., 30-39. 17 Neis F. S. Ferr? to Edgar S. Brightman, 18 May 1947, Brightman Papers; Ferr?, The Christian Understanding of God, quotes, 41.</page><page sequence="12">14 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy If being is creative, existence can be a predicate of being; and if being becomes what it is only through becoming, actualization is a predicate of being also. Ferr? reasoned that being plus becoming is greater than being minus becoming, just as the cause plus the effect that it actualizes is greater than the cause minus its effect. By this logic, God plus God's creation is greater than God minus God's creative work. Against the classical abstraction of the existence of being from the quality of being, Ferr? held that God's goodness is equally as certain as God's existence; against Thomas Aquinas in particular, he denied that being is logically prior to goodness. Goodness demands a category superior to being, Ferr? believed; even Aquinas came close to this verdict when he observed that "the good, in a sense, extends further than being." Instead of arbitrarily abstracting being from goodness, Aquinas and classical theology should have privileged the scriptural affirmation that God is Spirit and love. Christian thinking rightly begins with the perception that the nature of being is creative love, and love is the endless becoming of infinite being in relation to infinite nonbeing. The thrust of agapic love is to create a state of being that is not merely static or dynamic, "but actually different from and more than either separately or both together." 18 On the level of being and becoming, spirit was Ferr?'s ultimate category. Spirit is superpersonal, and the Spirit of God works on the sub-agapic level, deepening the personal being of spiritual selves through the drives of eros. Ferr? sharply distinguished between the intensifying, pedagogical work of the Spirit of God and the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God works on all levels below agap?, while the Holy Spirit works within the personal and communal context of God's agapic love. The Spirit of God works on the relation between eros and altruism, while the Holy Spirit works on those who come to Jesus and live in his transpowering light and love. Ontologically the spirit, the Spirit of God, and the Holy Spirit are the same and work together, but functionally they have different operations. God operates differently in different people, and the different levels of reality possess different ultimates. On the level of being and becoming, spirit is the ultimate category; on the level of purpose or meaning, 18 Ferr?, The Christian Understanding of God, quote 43; Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica I, v, 2; Aquinas, Selected Writings, ed. F. M. D'Arcy (New York: Everyman, 1941), "the good, in a sense," 93.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 27, No. 1, January 2006 15 which are personal, personality is the ultimate category; the category that unites these two ultimates is divine love. 19 Ferr?'s academic theology was long on metaphysical word spinning and constructing concepts out of concepts, but when he turned to the specific implications of his positions, he could be disarmingly frank. One of his rhetorical firecrackers became notorious; closer to his purpose, his book on God otherwise attracted attention for his frank repudiation of the doctrine of eternal hell and his insistence that faith in God's sovereign love requires a doctrine of God's total eschatological victory. "Either God is sovereign love or He is not," Ferr? declared. If God is not actually sovereign, the outcome of the world process is in doubt; and if God is not actually loving, the traditional Christian doctrine of eternal hell may be correct. God may be a sadist who tortures condemned souls forever. But if God is actually sovereign love, God's total victory is assured: "We must be unequivocally emphatic. If He is sovereign love, the question as to the outcome is completely closed. Love will win unconditional surrender from all that is not love, and God will rule everywhere and forever, apart only from new pedagogical processes where God works to share yet more His boundless grace." Traditional Christianity was terribly wrong to suppose that God condemns finite sinners to infinite punishment, Ferr? contended; however, it was not wrong to claim that no one is saved apart from God's gracious purpose in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is more than the historical Jesus, and God's gracious purpose is to win the redemption of all creation.20 "It is not necessary to know the historic Jesus in order for God's will and way to be accepted," Ferr? explained. "The eternal God is not exhausted by the historic Jesus and not to be equated with him in such a sense." God's Spirit works on people differently, according to circumstance, but God's love in Christ is constitutive of reality itself, and thus the requirements for the salvation of all persons are invariant. Only God can save anyone, and the God of Jesus Christ and the Spirit wills the salvation of all people. Hell is real, Ferr? assured, and the gospels rightly warn of it, but the idea of eternal hell is an abomination: "The very conception of an eternal hell is monstrous and an insult to the conception of last things in other religions, not to mention the Christian 19 Ferr?, The Christian Understanding of God, 44-46; Ferr?, Christianity and Society, 88-113,152-177. 20 Ferr?, The Christian Understanding of God, 219-224, quotes, 219, 219-220.</page><page sequence="14">16 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy doctrine of God's sovereign love." Putting it sharply, Ferr? remarked that Adolf Hitler would be a "third degree saint" compared to a God that tortures people forever. The fact that Christians even imagined such an idea, much less accepted it as doctrine, showed that they comprehended very little about the gospel: "No worse insult could be offered to Christ and no blasphemy of God could go deeper than this. God's name has been libeled beyond belief by those who sincerely think they know Him, love Him, and serve Him." 21 Ferr? allowed that the New Testament portrays Jesus as having taught the idea of eternal hell and it contains other passages that seem to teach this notion. It was possible that the New Testament writers actually had no concept of eternity as endless duration, but he did not rest his case on this argument. Ferr? countered that the Jesus sayings about hell are parables not to be taken literally, the message of Jesus "comes from some distance and with much dilution" in the New Testament, and Jesus and the New Testament writers also make strongly universalistic statements about God's love and salvation. In its "highest and deepest" passages, Ferr? argued, scripture teaches the logic of God's sovereign love: God is love, love never fails, God's mercy is everlasting, God shall be all in all, every knee shall bow. Scripture does not develop the implications of these assertions, partly because it is mostly existential, containing little explanatory discussion. More importantly, "this position is so high that the implications of it come but slowly." The disciples of Jesus did not grasp the logic of divine love; Jesus may not have grasped it either, though there are contrary clues; Paul may not have grasped it either, though the contrary clues are stronger in Paul. These questions of historical evidence and probability make "little difference" to the crucial matter of defining the Christian faith, Ferr? judged, "because when a basic truth comes bursting into history, it startles and shakes the first to see it, while the implications of that truth are so revolutionary and so far-ranging that those who first see the truth cannot necessarily see all the implications."22 That the earliest Christian communities did not preach the doctrine of universal salvation was understandable; that most contemporary churches still did not was unbelievable. Ferr? exhorted: "It is time that we think high thoughts in the realm of God's work in 21 Ibid., quotes, 224, 228. 22 Ibid., quotes, 245, 246, 247.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 27, No. 1, January 2006 17 last things." The church should not dispense with hell, but it needed to preach that hell has "a school and a door in it." The early church betrayed the gospel by condemning Origen for teaching universal salvation; classical theology sustained this betrayal for centuries and thus "crucified Christ afresh by condemning the full Gospel itself that God is sovereign love." Ferr?'s idea of a worthy corrective was Barth's God-centered doctrine of reconciliation, not liberal sentimentality. He rejoiced that Barth's (nearly explicit) universalism gleamed "like the sun." On the other hand, "major sections of actual Christendom" were far inferior to Hinduism and Buddhism. Ferr? admonished that modern Christianity could not preach a morally repugnant version of its gospel and successfully compete with Hinduism and Buddhism: "We must either present truth high enough to be acknowledged as spiritually and morally real and intellectually compelling or stand, in the end, to lose our Christian following." Everything in the world, including the words of scripture, must be interpreted and judged by the highest Christian norm, the divine love.23 Most of Ferr?'s arguments about universal salvation were staples of the liberal tradition, and his favorite liberal theologian, George Gordon, was eloquent on this theme. But Ferr? wrote for a wider theological audience than other liberals of his generation, and he rejected the typical liberal emphasis on human goodness. By taking an aggressive position on issues that liberal theologians had mostly stopped talking about, Ferr? outflanked the liberal movement to the left and right. He retained a prominent place for the language of hell, divine judgment, and conversion, but gave special offense to conservatives by blasting their theology as repugnant, grotesque, and un-Christian.24 He was sensitive to the question of audience. Ferr? wrote to provoke and persuade, and increasingly, his books did both. He came into international prominence during his Vanderbilt years; taught for two years in England; and was the only American theologian of his generation who was regularly invited to speak at seminaries across the 2 Ibid., quotes, 241, 246, 247; see Miliard J.

Writing in the style of an impassioned moderate, Ferr? seemed determined to show that the middle-ground does not have to be boring or lukewarm. One of his later and most characteristic sermons appealed for "extremism without extremity ... the extremism that is at the extreme center." In his telling, liberalism was confused and overly idealistic; the extreme left abandoned Christianity; and neo-orthodoxy was too negative and pessimistic, lacking faith in the transforming power of the Spirit. As for the theological right: "So-called orthodoxy is always man's meanest and most dangerous heresy." Ferr? conceived the "extreme center" as the homeland of genuine faithfulness, good-spiritedness, and agap? theology.25 Persistently he urged that liberal and traditional forms of Christianity both shortchanged the consuming love and glory of God. His book on God heightened his reputation as a theological provocateur, but not for the reason that he intended. In a fateful aside, Ferr? cited the Nazi legend that the father of Jesus was a German soldier stationed at a Roman garrison. He did not endorse this legend; his point was merely that it doesn't matter, religiously, whether Jesus was born of a virgin. This passage was red meat for fundamentalists, however, who attacked him ferociously. Fundamentalist leader John R. Rice's newspaper, Sword of the Lord, condemned Ferr? repeatedly as a communist, heretic, and "enemy of Christianity," admonishing readers against supporting "any school" that hired him. Vanderbilt chancellor Harvie Branscomb replied to critics that Ferr? was a man of integrity, albeit one prone to make "unneccesary remarks." Meanwhile theologians treated the book more respectfully, but with caveats. Writing in the Christian Century, W. B. Blakemore commented that Ferr?'s style was "torrential rather than fluent," and perhaps too lively; in the Journal of Religion, Edwin E. Aubrey protested that Ferr?'s conclusions derived from his definitional presuppositions, not from inductive reasoning. The firestorm came with Ferr?'s next book, The 25 Neis F. S.

A young prophet tried to persuade the group to experience the sun directly by venturing into its light, but they killed him for disrespecting their religious tradition. Over time the sunworshippers erected various small umbrellas underneath the big one, which recorded the prophet's sayings, codified the group's structure and beliefs, and identified different creedal factions; meanwhile they argued about the sun while refusing to experience it. Ferr? likened the shielded sunworshippers to modern Christians. Instead of living in the sunshine of God's universal love, Christians hid under idolatrous doctrines of Christ, the Bible, and the church. They called Jesus the Savior and forgot that "God alone is to be worshiped"; many treated the Bible as revelation rather than a witness to revelation; in various ways they allowed disagreements over church polity to thwart God's will for the church. Ferr? charged: "Our faith is in umbrellas. We trust generally in the historic Jesus, in the Bible and in the Church, but have no vital, personal, all-absorbing life with God Himself. We pray 'through Jesus Christ our Lord,' but we seldom get through! We do not personally get through to God. God Himself is a stranger to us, although God is Himself the God of all comforts, before, beyond and through all things." 27 Rightly understood and experienced, he argued, Christianity is about the relationship between personal Spirit and personal spirit: "The living personal Spirit is the heart of truth. The more our spirits live with Him and in line with His purpose the more truth we know."

On the ethics of the latter point, Ferr? gave only a paragraph to racial prejudice and segregation, which he called "the sign and seal of sin," but it was noticed in 1953. Genuine cultural pluralism is a social and moral good, he allowed, but segregation of racial groups based on compulsion is morally unacceptable and incompatible with the gospel. The church has a moral imperative to welcome all God's children into the loving arms of the community of God.28 Ferr? acknowledged that healing the broken relation between Christians and Jews was more complicated theologically, but here as well, the answer was the love ethic of a liberalized agap?-theology. Jesus did not invent the religion of divine love; rather, he stood within a Jewish tradition which taught that the essence of true religion is the love of God and persons. Most provocatively of all in 1953 Ferr? stressed that Communism was essentially a secularized form of Jewish messianism, and though much of it was false and evil, it rested on a bedrock of truth about the reality of the class war and the predatory nature of capitalism. Unlike most of the Christian church, the Communists had a recent history of caring about the suffering masses of humanity; on the other hand, the Communists were wrong in believing that violence and revolutionary dictatorship are redemptive.29 The Sun and the Umbrella inspired a barrage of indignant sermons, editorials, and unwelcome mail, and heightened the popular pressure on Vanderbilt to get rid of Ferr?. One influential Memphis banker and member of the university's board of trust, Vance Alexander, campaigned continually against him; and a popular radio program, Hunt's Facts Forum, denounced him repeatedly. Ferr?'s fervently evangelical style of expression may have heightened the rage that some fundamentalists felt toward him. His earlier provocations about pacifism, capitalism, social democracy, the virgin birth, the historical Jesus, and traditional orthodoxy were recycled, and he provided fresh material. Various groups cancelled lecture invitations, though others filled his crowded speaking schedule. By the time that Ferr? published 28 Ibid., quotes, 81,95. 29 Ibid., 101-126, 146-149.</page><page sequence="19">Vol. 27, No. 1, January 2006 21 Christ and the Christian in 1958, he had returned to Andover Newton, where Chancellor Branscomb was happy to see him go.30 The key to Ferr?'s Christology was his point of departure from personalist idealism. Though his theology was essentially personalist, and the personalists at Boston University regarded him as belonging to their school, his early writings criticized personalism for detracting from "the fullness of the Christian faith." Personalist idealism invested too heavily in its theory of personality, he believed, and classical orthodoxy had done well not to define God ultimately in personalistic categories. Though personality is very important, the personalists erred in lifting it above the categories of spirit and love. Ferr?'s later work amplified this argument by focusing on the relation between encounter and coinherence. Personalism was a theology of spiritual Personality, but Ferr? admonished that God is a personal Spirit. The difference was crucial because "persons" do not coinhere and the idea of God as personal Spirit better fits the Chalcedonian affirmation that God is beyond Jesus and in Jesus.31 In essence, Ferr? espoused a modified adoptionism. Nicaea (325 CE) affirmed the full deity of Jesus; Constantinople (381) affirmed the full humanity of Jesus; Chalcedon (451) formulated the doctrine of the two natures of Christ in one person, affirming the unity of Jesus's personality; and the third council of Constantinople (681) declared the perpetual distinction and separate fullness of Christ's two natures. Ferr? accepted the theological framework of the councils while noting that its fundamental structure, formulated at Chalcedon, was undermined before and after it was established by the Athanasian identification of the second person of the Trinity with the ego of Jesus. The latter position bonded the personal God to an impersonal humanity, turning the baby Jesus into a sovereign deity that only appeared to grow in wisdom and stature. Ferr? believed that Chalcedonian orthodoxy made sense if it was stripped of its acquired Athanasian mistakes.32 What was needed was a stable grundmotif that integrated the New Testament's various Christologies and the truth of religious ,0 "Methodists Cancel Ferr?

The New Testament interprets Jesus as the Messiah, the Logos, the first-born of creation, God, and the adopted Son of God. Ferr? argued that these significantly different models had a common motif: Jesus Christ as the event and meaning of divine agap?. Christ incarnates the unconditional and self-sufficient divine love that saves the world, recapitulating the history of humankind by fully entering human experience and fulfilling it. Jesus entered humanity like all other human beings, and he fulfilled human history by allowing his life to be fully controlled by God's loving nature. Like all human beings, Ferr? explained, Jesus was born and developed within the human history that he recapitulated and he was born and developed as a child of God's Spirit: "We need to see in Jesus a real human being, fulfilled by God to the point where God was the consummating co-Subject along with an accepting human subject, but both within a truly united and genuine personality." Qualitatively, God was literally present in Jesus in the same way that God is present through grace in other human beings. The point of Christianity is not to make an idol of Jesus, but to become as much like Jesus as possible. Jesus was the "Godman" whose ego was neither divine or human, but rather a new spiritual union of divine and human nature. He should not be called the Savior, for it was God who carried the burden of human sin upon the cross. And he should not be confessed in the categories of substance philosophy, because the incarnation is essentially relational.33 The key to incarnation is the claim that the divine and human realms can coexist and actually indwell each other. Ferr? judged that the early church grasped this idea, but its substantialist language of essence and persons undermined the Chalcedonian affirmation of incarnational union. God and human beings were conceived as different substances, and much of the church followed Cyril of Alexandria and Leontius of Byzantium in conceptualizing the incarnation as the union of a full divine nature with an impersonal, incomplete human nature (anhypostasia). Ferr? believed that personalist theology had similar problems, because personalities are distinct unities of experience that do not overlap as personalities. Whiteheadian organicism was also inadequate, because it was too biological and impersonal to express the highest claims of Christian faith. Ferr?'s alternative was a Spirit coinherence revision of personalist idealism and Whiteheadian process. 33 Ibid., 54, 94-117, 141-187, quote 97.</page><page sequence="21">Vol. 27, No. 1, January 2006 23 The Whiteheadians rightly emphasized that structure is changed by function within process, and the personalists did justice to Christian personal theism. But personalism had no basis for speaking of actual coinherence, which made Paul's confession that Christ lived in him (Galatians 2:20) merely paradoxical from a personalist standpoint. Ferr? countered that the realm of paradox ends at the level of spiritual reality. Kierkegaard, upon turning to matters of Spirit in his later life, dropped his paradoxical spinning, for he shared Ferr?'s perception that spiritual reality is "the land of true explanation." Ferr? argued that God is Spirit, and the form of Spirit is personal, and the content of Spirit is love: "Spirit is the capacity to be oneself and yet to create what is other than self; Spirit is the ability to be in oneself and yet to communicate with what is not self; Spirit is the power thus to transcend self by creative society and communication." In Christianity the Spirit is revealed as Father-love, and the order of this revelation is crucial. It is not the trinity of Father, Love, and Spirit, which makes the personal category ultimate; the actual order and content of revelation is that "the Spirit is a Person who is Love." By beginning with the Spirit, Christianity lays hold of the most inclusive category of reality, one that makes a genuinely relational incarnation the center of Christian proclamation. Christianity is about the making of a new creation by the interp?n?tration of Spirit and spirit. Human beings are so designed by the Creator Spirit to find fulfillment only through the experience of God's presence as loving Spirit, and as the actual presence of God's Spirit in and with human existence, Jesus initiated the new creation that God's covenant relationship with Israel prefigured. All agap? is of God, who is personal Spirit; human beings are spirits who love conditionally out of self-desire; God incarnate is the personal Word in whom the Spirit of divine love and the spirit of eros coinhere. Though he avoided the term "deification" and only mentioned Orthodoxy in the context of referring to the early Greek Fathers, Ferr? was a prophet of the faith that Christians are joint-heirs with Christ.35 His christology was ferociously condemned by conservatives for humanizing Christ and denying the virginal conception. Attacks on Ferr?'s position and character went on for years; radio and newspaper campaigns against him were organized; effigies of him were burned and hanged; and more speaking invitations were withdrawn?while others 34 Ibid., quotes, 126, 129-130. 35 Ibid., 130-133.</page><page sequence="22">24 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy poured in. Though he held warm feelings for his many friends at Vanderbilt and throughout the South, Ferr? was relieved to spend his later career at Andover Newton, where he felt safer and better supported. Frederick Ferr? recalls that even in family conversations, his father did not fuss about the attacks upon him: "It hurt him, but he preferred to absorb the pain and go on to the next attempt to convince them." Typically, Ferr?'s mainline reviewers split between lauding his profundity and chiding his religious fervor. Kirkus described Christ and the Christian as "a profound, but at the same time almost lyrical book"; Walter Weist remarked in the Princeton Seminary Bulletin that Ferr? presented "his sometimes unorthodox positions with originality, courage, and considerable verve," though he worried that Ferr? again provoked "the hounds of orthodoxy"; in the Christian Century, Joseph Haroutunian panned: "The reader hardly dares criticize here, for fear that to do such a thing would be to admit that he neither has the vision nor is a Christian. Indeed he has the uncomfortable sense that he is being subjected to a browbeating as sustained as it is 'inspired.'" 36 Ferr? evoked similar reactions throughout his career. Repeatedly praised for his brilliance, creativity, and spiritual sincerity, and showered with lecture invitations across North America and Great Britain, he alienated others with his sweeping claims to cosmic truth and religious certainty, and offended many by aggressively suggesting that Tillich was not a Christian. Though he claimed to think "as little as possible" about the thoughts of others and as much as possible about "permanent truth," Ferr? wrote at length about theological trends, was often rough on fellow theologians, and made no secret of his disappointment that he lacked the stature or following of Tillich and Niebuhr.37 36 Frederick Ferr? to author, 10 September 2002; review of Christ and the Christian, by Neis F.

Ferr? developed this idea in his last years. Resigning from Andover Newton in 1965, he moved to Parsons College as a scholar in residence, but Parsons lost its accreditation, and Ferr? moved to the College of Wooster, where he taught until his death in 1971. His last substantial works, The Living God of Nowhere and Nothing (1966) and The Universal Word (1969), restated his distinctive themes, but the former book was a patchwork that he threw together just after his travels in East Asia. The latter book was his masterwork.38 The Universal Word had a wider theoretical frame than Ferr?'s previous writings and a new name for his social ideal, "unimunity." Theology deals with ultimates, he argued, and ultimates are universal. If spirit and love are ultimates, they cannot be ultimates only for Christianity, but rather possess a fulfilling dimension of truth universally. Christianity is worth talking about only if it is universally true, and it is true because it centers in a universal Word that outstrips all religions and philosophies, including Christianity. Long after the coded term "one world" had passed out of favor in American politics, Ferr? continued to use it. His Whiteheadian-like ideal was a full unity of distinct entities that coinhere in the richest possible variety of difference. In his last book he blended the words "unity" and "community" to create a new name for this ideal, "unimunity." Everything that exists comes from one Spirit, he reasoned, and spirit/Spirit is multidimensional. It is the power of being that has the capacity to remain selfsame and yet participate through coinherence in all forms and dimensions of being, becoming, and non-being. As love and personal purpose, Spirit is meaning-creative and dynamic; more broadly, Spirit is the ultimately inclusive ultimate, "the category of identity in reality."

Ferr? left Hegel alone, borrowing from him only the term "concrete Universal." Referring to the Vedarthasamgraha debate between Ramanuja and Sankara on whether God can be an entity, Ferr? urged that contrapletal logic is not exclusively Eastern.39 Western philosophy contains the contrapletal idea that contradictions on one level or dimension can be non-contradictory on another level or dimension, he noted; something that doesn't exist on one level may be necessary on another. Yin and yang polarities such as light and darkness make easy examples; more importantly, spirit can be present and absent at the same time. Though God is personal Spirit and the source and power of personality, in some respects God is also transpersonal spirit, working impersonally, as in the stirrings of human conscience. In other words, Ferr? wrote, "predicates which can only be mutually contradictory in one dimension become contrapletal within the multidimensional ontology." God can be simultaneously present and absent in a given person without contradiction, because God is Spirit. Unlike two objects, spirit and object can occupy the same space at the same time. Two personalities cannot occupy the same physical or psychic space at the same time, because personalities are distinct, "but in spirit two persons can be one, and spirit and a person can be one." Spirit is indivisible, yet infinitely multidimensional. Ferr? urged that this is the key to the universality of the Word. Christ cannot be divided if "the Lord is the Spirit." The Word is universal because spirit is the indivisible and always-present identity of reality. 40 The Universal Word recycled Ferr?'s usual themes, that God is creative and personal Spirit, motivated by love; the Incarnate Word is the God of personal love and the all-inclusive Spirit; love is the final meaning of spirit and the personal; the spirit of cooperation must replace all forms of individualism and authoritarianism; creation is a pedagogical process that stretches into eternity; eternity is the life of divine love; being is not the best ultimate, either as substance or process; theology must move beyond the categories of substance and process; and spirit is the most inclusive and universal ultimate. But Ferr?'s argument and field of vision were wider and more ambitious in his last book. Though he sorely regretted that Whitehead and Tillich didn't believe in personal life after death, his affinities with their 39 Ibid., 130-133. 40 Ibid., quotes, 133, 135.</page><page sequence="25">Vol. 27, No. 1, January 2006 27 thought grew stronger in his theology. He loved Whitehead's description of the flow of experience, remarking that the Whiteheadian vision became "more real and grasping" to him in his later years. In phrases that resembled Tillich's later thinking on the universality of the Logos and the provincialism of classical Christianity, Ferr? also criticized Western Christianity for substituting a ghettoized Christ-idol for the Universal Word. The real Christ is not "the divisive Word of an ingroup religion," he protested. Christianity does not own Christ, for "all religions belong within and through the Universal Word." 41 This was not an argument for a monolithic super-religion or a new eclecticism. Ferr? believed in the normative truth of the universal Word, but in the field of religions he believed in the Word's normative universality only as "unimunity." It was not a question of advocating, defending, or refuting any particular religion or many religions. "The gifts of the Spirit come in the forms of many religions, according to need, background, and response," he explained. Religions are not created by winning arguments and are not reducible to any particular constellation of events or doctrines: "The eternal faithfulness of the Spirit, the inclusive Love, the Universal Word, is and always will be one. The Source of Significance is one. Yet that one is an eternal unconditional for-ness in human history that all religions find their own proper nature and fulfillment." 42 Ferr? and the Personalist Tradition Afew months before Tillich died in 1965, Ferr? told him that he should recast his entire theology in the category of spirit instead of being. Tillich had recently made a beginning toward this end in the third volume of his Systematic Theology and his lectures on the universal religion of concrete spirit. He replied that, indeed, his system worked better as a theology of spirit, but cautioned that "no undertaking could be more profound and complicated." He had run out of time to write new volumes of theology. Though Ferr? had struggled with poor 41 Ibid., 86-88, 245-247, quotes, 245, 233, 232; see Paul Tillich, Christianity and the Encounter of World Religions (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963; reprint, Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1994), 26-47; Tillich, "The Significance of the History of Religions for the Systematic Theologian," The Future of Religions, ed.

He hoped that he still had time to write major works; his later thinking had strong affinities with Tillich's theology of ultimate concern; and he viewed his later work as a neo-supernaturalist improvement on Tillich. Tillich's vague ground of being was not the God of eternal life and love; Ferr? countered that the "most adequate worship of God" must allow meaning to be infused by "the eternal mystery of the Father of our spirits and the reality of our love." 43 The Universal Word was merely a beginning, as Ferr? realized. What was needed was a fully-developed theology of universal faith. His next book, a theory of symbols and myths as channels of transcendence, was to be called The Explanatory Word, and he had further books in mind. One of them would rethink Whitehead's cosmological system in terms of metaphysical universals. In Ferr?'s graduate school days, while discussing with Whitehead the differences between cosmology and metaphysics, Whitehead had acknowledged that he was "only nascently a metaphysical thinker." His cosmology was basically an extrapolation upon his earlier work as a philosopher of science. Whitehead thought in terms of physics and biology; thus his cosmological system was predominantly geocentric, not theocentric. According to Ferr?, "He confessed this fact to me frankly and hoped that some theologian would lift the discussion to a different, a distinctly theological dimension." Ferr? viewed himself as that theologian?"It is this very task to which I now address myself?but worried that he was running out of time. Even if he lived to write more books, he could only make a beginning on a universal theology of spirit that moved beyond Tillich and Whitehead. This project would need a school of successors: "Most of the work along these lines must be done by vigorous thinkers with interest to explore trails I have hardly begun to blaze." 44 Had he taught at Boston University, Ferr? might have inspired a Brightman-like rethinking of personalist idealism in its third and fourth generations. He and Muelder were good friends, he was widely viewed as a borderline personalist, and he made his critique of the personalist school at a time when even Brightman's disciples were deeply concerned about the limitations of their school's mind-centered idealism. Ferr?'s critiques of personalist epistemological dualism and its lack of a theory of coinherence or mutual immanence were not 43 Ferr?, "Tillich and the Nature of Transcendence," quotes, 16, 17. 44 Ferr?, 77z&lt;? Universal Word, quotes, 140, 246-247.</page><page sequence="27">Vol. 27, No. 1, January 2006 29 subjects on which personalist theory was impervious to revision. Similarly, he justly complained that personalism remained stuck in the problems of substantialist metaphysics, but the personalists were strong critics of substantialism, too, and Brightman labored for many years to strip Bowne's theory of the self of its substantialist glue. Ferr?'s claim that personalism was committed to a "separate Personality" concept of God, modeled on the supreme being of classical theism, was a fair description of Knudson's theology, but not of the temporalist theism of Brightman, Muelder, and Schilling. He seemed to forget that he once criticized Brightman for overidentifying God with the world process. Though Ferr? had significant differences with personalist theory, he tended to exaggerate his departure from it, and to overidentify personalism with Bowne and Knudson. Like Brightman, and unlike DeWolf and Schilling, he brimmed with paradigm-changing intellectual energy, and Ferr?'s later interest in developing a metaphysically-grounded universal faith was one of Brightman's strongest concerns, though Brightman wrote little about it. Though forceful in his insistence that the personalists mistakenly defined the spiritual in terms of the personal and the moral, Ferr? was certainly a personalist in the broad sense of the term that Knudson, Brightman, and Muelder invoked. Had he been a Methodist or taught at Boston University, he might have identified enough with the personalist school to revise its theology in something like the ways that Brightman revised Bowne's philosophy and Muelder revised Brightman's theory of the self. But Ferr? was an intellectual loner, his position blended a host of perspectives, and his style was too personalized to build a school of his own. James Duke observes that his position was virtually inimitable because of its patchwork of motifs and Ferr?'s emphasis on "the Holy Spirit's synergistic promptings." Duke underestimates the essential coherence and continuity of Ferr?'s position, but he is right that its highly personal appropriation of evangelical, personalist, Lundensian, social gospel, social democratic, Tillichian, Whiteheadian, and Eastern perspectives militated against the making of a school. Though widely read and heard, he produced no disciples who wrote theology in his fashion. The most accomplished religious thinker to be directly influenced by him, Frederick Ferr?, remarked of his father's personality and legacy: "He was always a shy immigrant boy inside. I think he was quite conscious of his 'outsider' position and knew himself worthy of</page><page sequence="28">30 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy disciples like his counterparts, the Niebuhr brothers and Tillich, and grieved quietly that his vision was not more widely shared." 45 Elsewhere Frederick Ferr? commented on the fervently spiritual character of his father's work: "For him, merely academic theology was unthinkable. Those who remember him will recall the glow of spirituality that marked his presence. That spirituality was deep and real. He immersed himself in personal daily readings from his well thumbed and underlined Bibles, sturdy books but worn out regularly in less than a year by his passionate attentions." Ferr? prayed to the point of exhaustion throughout his life. He once recalled that during his years of intense physical suffering his wife scolded him for praying too much, believing that it worsened his illness. He responded by learning to pray in new ways that lifted his spirit, and his family accepted that prayer was his spiritual wellspring. Frederick Ferr? recalled that his father found prayer "more refreshing than sleep." Though critical of "average Christianity," Ferr? loved the church and thus wrote more than one third of his books for laypeople; Frederick Ferr? remarked: "Theology was to be edifying, not simply scholarly, no matter who the intended reader; and, consequently, even in his most technical books ecstatic passages break forth almost into song, to the astonished embarrassment, I suppose, of the purely professional reader."46 Frederick Ferr? was one of those embarrassed academics. For many years, he recalled in 1978, he winced at his father's displays of religious feeling, which threatened his own sense of rational control. Partly as a self-defense from his father's pietism, some of it unconscious, he took a more rationalistic and academy-centered approach to the philosophy of religion. Only in the mid-1970s did he come to appreciate that Neis Ferr?'s violations of academic form were connected to his insistence that the function of theology is to transform the world. Neis Ferr? believed that theology must not settle for anything 45 Duke, "A Century and a Quarter of Theology," 344; Frederick Ferr? to author, 10 September 2002; see Frederick Ferr?, Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1967); Frederick Ferr?, Hellfire and Lightning Rods: Liberating Science, Technology and Religion (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1993); Frederick Ferr?, Being and Value: Toward a Constructive Postmodern Metaphysics (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996); Frederick Ferr? and Kent Bendall, Exploring the Logic of Faith: A Dialogue on the Relation of Modern Philosophy to Christian Faith (New York: Association Press, 1962). 46 Frederick Ferr?, 'Toward Transformational Theology: A Dialogue with My Father," 13; Neis F.
