<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECTRUM Dramatic beds JAMES PRYDE 1866-1941 Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh 14 August-11 October 1992 Asked near the end of his life how he was, James Pryde responded 'One foot in the grave and the other on a banana skin'.1 We laugh; and yet the remark goes right to the heart of his black comedy, violent enigma and, sometimes, plainly flawed artistic performance. Brought up in Edinburgh in a theatre-loving family, Pryde himself acted and he painted his friends Sir Henry Irving and Ellen Terry. His career was launched when, as he put it, 'I decided to become half a poster artist',2 forming the 'BeggarstafF' partnership with his brother-in-law William Nicholson; division and fracture were to become a life-long preoccupation. Pryde's reputation has relied heavily on his 1890s work with Nicholson. Posters like Hamlet , with its compelling symbolism of cut-out black on plain brown wrapping paper, were inspired by Beardsley, Lautrec and the French Nabis and caused a revolution in British design. Nowadays it seems but a small step from the blank square 'window' in the Beggarstaffs' Chinaman to the abstract art of William Nicholson's son Ben. Yet the Edinburgh exhibition, the first devoted to Pryde in his own right for 50 years, was a timely reminder that this was actually a stride across a subtle and complex phase of British art. What Augustus John described as a typical Pryde, 'displaying under an ominous green sky the dilapidated grandeur of a building, haunted rather than tenanted by the unclassified tatterdemalions of Jimmy's dreams'3 can been seen, as the soundly researched and beautifully produced catalogue suggests, as the spiritual forefather of John Piper's blitzed churches and even Francis Bacon's figurai distortions. Some of Pryde's pictures were undoubtedly formulaic: near monochrome, Piranesi-scaled ruins, draped with rags or blotched with blood, and always on rough canvas. Giant ruined architecture and Hogarthian beggars were arguably much better painted by Brangwyn, whilst Sickert's analyses of an audience as dramatis personae are probably more penetrating than Pryde's device of landscape framed by a 'proscenium arch'. Though the show might have been more selective, the best of Pryde's work was deeply impressive, like the purple-shadowed Casa Rosa with its rare sunburst of dull tangerine, painted on a trip to Venice in 191 1- 12, and there was an indubitably Surrealist note (he was called a British de Chirico). His art recalls the violent Romanticism of Gustav Doré's London and Géricault's mad people, and the exhibition gave fascinating insights into relationships with music, theatre and decorative design. One of the most striking images was the 1897 pencil portrait of Pierrot, cipher-like and anticipating Egon Schiele. RSA JOURNAL, NOVEMBER 1992 Provoking the spectator's imagination to supply colour from minimal hints - red coxcomb and black eye-patch - it was a graphic illustration of Pryde's belief that 'It is the conception which matters'.4 In later work this found expression through visual Leitmotive, just as he paid overt homage to Wagner in his Flying Dutchman pictures, so that inanimate objects like the 'Great Bed', recur with inner, even anthropomorphic significance. Inspired by a four-poster at Holyrood House, this took the leading role in his 1 3 Human Comedy canvases which culminate in The Death of the Great Bed itself, its giant hangings collapsed and smothering it;s occupant. A Baroque extravaganza which Pryde distorted into a towering edifice, the Bed's hangings are sometimes in shreds; sometimes like the curtains of a stage. It reappeared in his stark stage sets for the 1930 Othello at the Savoy Theatre with Paul Robeson, Peggy Ashcroft and Sybil Thorndike, and its hangings were transformed into the tattered tricoloured drapes blowing in the vast doorway of The Ragged Room of c. 1923, in what 791 (collation: Witional (iallcrics of Scotland) Sir Henry Irving as Dubose in ' The Lyons Mail '</page><page sequence="2">must surely have been ironic mockery of the Versailles Peace Treaty. Personal bereavement and the Great War significantly darkened Pryde's mood, perhaps most poignantly in his 17 paintings of 1912-22 for Lady Cowdray at Dunecht House in Aberdeenshire. The exhibition's centrepiece, their cyclic exploration of ruin and destruction loosely illustrates Dunecht history, with one picture sombrely celebrating Lord Cowdray's restorations. Pryde complemented the series with a mural of The Madonna of the Ruins , perhaps unconsciously seeking catharsis in his construction of a decorative ensemble which was, of course, also the natural counterpart to his poster and stage design. Some of the Dunecht works are 'capriccios', appropriat- ing Edinburgh landmarks such as the British Linen Bank as 'stage property', but most frequently his architecture finds its closest counterpart in the monumental closed arches of railway cuttings and the arcading of viaducts. Its desecration with fire and blood subverts the classicism of his Paris teacher Bouguereau, but, more profoundly, suggests revulsion against the industrial age in the same way as Pryde's Celebrated Criminals. These included the legendary French- man Cartouche, and characters from Wilkinson's Newgate Calendar such as 'Hook-handed' Gamaliel Ratsey, Jack 792 Sheppard the robber, John Price the public executioner, and Dick Turpin. For all the Beggarstaffs' radicalism and their influence on Edward Gordon Craig's simplified stage design, Pryde's world was a retreat from, rather than reconciliation with, his times. His rediscovery gives a new dimension to British figurative art. CLARE A. P. WILLSDON Lecturer in History of Art, University of Glasgow 1. Recounted by W. O.
