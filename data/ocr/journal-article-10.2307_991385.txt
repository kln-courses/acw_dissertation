Cornered and beaten silly, knotted with complexities and deconstructions, the claims of truth and essence have a way of rising up for the next round. You might think that the thirty-year poststructuralist 212 JSAH / 57:2, JUNE 1998</page><page sequence="2">assault on the master narratives would have driven transcendence into the locker room, leaving the ring to earthbound and culture- based analyses. Hasn't the crisis of totality revolutionized arguments about architec- tural meaning and beauty? Don't abnor- mality, the everyday, and the exceptional now constitute "other" nomenclatures for architecture, ones that elide the aphoristic flash of authenticity? Alas, such is not al- ways the case. Essentialist architectural fantasies have not vanished; they have not even gone underground. True, they are less numer- ous than in recent history and profess more modest goals. But, absent Archimedean doctrines of theological or epistemological authority, essentialist thinkers have only looked to other grounds. Most often, they are drawn to anthropomorphic terms and to verbs like "building," "inhabiting," and "perceiving." The most influential essen- tialist theory of architecture is that of phe- nomenology, anchored by Martin Heideg- ger's often read but less often grasped essay, "Building, Dwelling, Thinking" (originally published in Vortrdge und Auf- sdtze [Pfullingen, 1954], 145-162). The lat- est entry in this tradition is Karsten Har- ries's The Ethical Function of Architecture, a summation statement by a philosopher who has written extensively about art and archi- tecture for over thirty years. Harries does not conceive of ethics in the sense commonly understood. As he sees it, ethics long ago lost its original and full meaning. The word was impoverished by its severance from beauty and knowl- edge during the Enlightenment, when each of these terms was instrumentalized and objectivized. For Harries, the point of writ- ing architectural theory is to recover the earlier humanistic meaning of ethics, to understand the word as ethos, and to pro- mulgate a lasting and authentic architec- ture in our time. For phenomenologists, the poetic and performative lives of words are the princi- pal routes to ethos and real meaning. Po- etry, almost alone of human creations, is what remains of ages-old ethos. Its words provide insight into what matters. Heideg- ger wrote that language is the key to man- kind, the source of his greatest insights but also his rudest alienations. In that tradi- tion, Harries's book is a struggle with lan- guage, and specifically a struggle with that language developed over the past half- millennium by aesthetic philosophers and architectural theorists. Presumably, through hermeneutical excavations of key theoreti- cal terms, architecture may be led back from the precipice of instrumentality, that edge where reason emptied actions of val- ues, and where the discipline was unfruit- fully divided between viewing subjects and viewed objects. As is typically the case with phenom- enologists, Harries takes a decidedly nega- tive stance with regard to the built environ- ments of the past two hundred years. Like Heidegger, he regards capitalism and tech- nology as the main culprits. Contra post- modernism and its acceptance of market- place fragmentation and technological invasiveness, Harries wants us to re-create a purer time of widespread and readily un- derstood meanings. Contra individualism and the cult of originality, he seeks a long- lost communal architectural voice to speak across time and geography. The EthicalFunc- tion of Architecture attempts to lead architec- ture back from the labyrinths of the self epitomized by Robert Venturi's decorated shed and toward a type of communal de- sign ethos once embodied by sacral archi- tecture. Harries writes: "What architecture lacks today is what the great styles of the past provided: a developed system of sym- bols that architects could presuppose and therefore did not have to invent" (133). The chief culprit for Harries is aesthet- ics, the point of view that sees architecture either as a combination of real construc- tion and significatory decoration or as a negation of one by the other. Harries re- gards decoration as an arbitrary, aesthetic addition to building and, most damningly, the cause of superficiality and illegibility in modern and postmodern architecture. Aes- thetics, in this sense, amounts to a fascina- tion with marketplace trends and avant- gardist posturing. Harries prefers the idea of ornament, despite the pejorative associations given to it by architects earlier in this century. In contrast to the decadence of decoration, ornament articulates a shared ethos: "all genuine ornament carries the promise of an integrated way of life, a promise of full humanity and thus also of genuine commu- nity" (60). The wonder of ornament, like many crucial phenomenological concepts, is its mimetic quality. Harries understands mi- mesis not as servile copying but rather as the human act of representing the world. Architectural mimesis tells us what it means to be in a world by acting in that world, by humanizing the world of materials within the presentation of architecture. Interest- ingly, ornamental mimesis expresses truth precisely because of its second-order, repre- sentational nature. For Harries, architects give shape to the functions of life by repre- senting building as architecture and by turning shelter into home. They ornament their world. Moreover, the repetitive qual- ity of mimesis with regard to its actions upon the history of architecture allows ar- chitectural meaning to become universal: "repetition recognizes time even as it re- fuses to recognize death" (258). Orna- ment establishes truth and the everlasting. Through exhaustive historical case stud- ies, ranging from the Renaissance to the contemporary era, Harries drives home ornament's mimetic wonders. Paraphras- ing Marc-Antoine Laugier, he argues that architecture became an art to the extent that it imitated natural processes. Laugier conceived of ornament as a double repre- sentation of nature and the humanized nature of Classical Greek architecture; it connected architecture to both nature and culture, more specifically the local con- texts of the French woodlands and the ancien retgime. An example of a modern ornament is Louis Kahn's creation of con- centrated expressions out of the idea that governs the structure. At the Yale Art Gal- lery, a triangle is ringed by a light crowning stairway: "the abbreviated signature of that building's idea: the penetration of horizon- tal, tetrahedral slabs by the stairwell's cylin- drical shaft" (56). Modern architectural ornament is an ironic double play on the world of nature as understood through geometry and on the world of culture as created with advanced construction techniques. Finally and fundamentally, ornament is true because it creates place--one of archi- tecture's most important tasks. Genuine ornament is an act of being-in-the-world, putting individuals in a shared place that enables them to form a community: "a space of intelligibility implying a definite stance toward persons and things" (62). Place, in this sense, is wrested architectur- ally from space; it is the outline of design BOOKS 213</page><page sequence="3">created in response to the vast formless expanses of the macrocosm. Consequently, Harries is opposed to uncentered space, the kind of space inaugurated by the mechanistic theories of Rene Descartes and Isaac Newton. He has no patience with the kind of dynamic, fluctuating space con- structed in the wake of vehicular, super- sonic, and Web communication. Instead, he envisions architecture as a conservative act: a struggle to set boundaries on any new unlimited spaces that may emerge and an act of centering to establish human- istic coherence. Harries's book reinterprets architec- tural history from a narrow point of view. He covers a vast number of buildings and theories but adds little to the historical literature. He enters into no contempo- rary debates on theory and largely ignores contemporary design. His observations on architecture, although voluminous, are ei- ther gleaned from secondary sources or unduly driven by his Heideggerian agenda. This mode of operative history is not convincing because it creates divisions that end up repudiating the great bulk of archi- tecture of the past three hundred years. As depicted by Harries, the world has three parts: (1) the authentic originary relation- ships that existed before technology, being-in-the-world; (2) contemporary traces of these relationships in poetry and art that can function to lead back to that ethos of performance; and (3) all else, the vast bulk of inauthentic, technological manifestations of architecture. He summa- rizes the last condition as follows: "We have only to walk through one of our cities or just flip through our architectural jour- nals to get a sense that architecture still has not found its way" (6). Put simply, the mass of stuff out there is problematic. In his quest for authenticity, Harries condemns humanity's development of a massive tech- nological and artistic enterprise, both its factual/scientific analyses and imaginative speculations. He also condemns by implica- tion all features of the modernist and post- modern eras: the photographic camera and charge-coupling devices, engineering and machines, steel and plastic, advertis- ing and real estate development, neurosis and hysteria. Throughout the book, the use of terms like "place," "ornament," "ethos," and "community" remind the reader of the superiority of premodern times. Can there be any positive appraisal of a modern- postmodern culture within this type of nar- rative? And what would it mean if contem- porary architects also repudiated the plethora of mediating technologies men- tioned above in order to focus on immedi- ately experienced phenomena or the per- fectly framed place? At one point Harries asks if he is guilty of a backward-looking, false essentialism. His quick dismissal of this moment of self-revelation is disappoint- ing. The question, if taken more seriously, might have resulted in a more nuanced response to the complex relationship be- tween architecture, technology, and the marketplace. Harries briefly mentions the impor- tance of social concerns in architecture, yet this direction does not force his train of thought. The interaction between architecture and religion, philosophy, eco- nomic systems, and politics is of distant relevance to this book. Despite consider- able theoretical attention in recent years to cultural studies, reception theory, and the new historicism, Harries has written a book on architectural meaning that argues once again for universal, timeless meaning and, in effect, denies cultural pluralism. Given its distrust of the contemporary world and refusal to see architecture as culturally contingent and composed of con- flicting and unpredictable elements, this book could well have appeared thirty years ago. - Mitchell Schwarzer California College of Arts and Crafts</page></plain_text>
