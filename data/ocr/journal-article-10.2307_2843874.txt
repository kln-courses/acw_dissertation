<plain_text><page sequence="1">xvii PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. THE "ECCENTRIC FLINTS " OF CENTRAL AMERICA. [WITH PLATES I-VIII.] By T. A. JOYCE, O.B.E., M.A. THE term " Eccentric Flints " is sanctified by usage, but these peculiar examples of Stone-Age art and craftsmanship include specimens made of obsidian, a volcanic glass which is a little harder than the hardest glass of our commercial age. Their meaning is obscure, their technique equals the finest products of Denmark, and, if it can be surpassed, is surpassed only bv the finest " ripple-flaked " blades of Egypt. Early excavation associated them particularly with the Cayo District of British Honduras, the region of Benque Viejo and the ruins of Xunantunich; but later researches have produced similar examples as far north as Tikal, and, further south, at Lubaantun, Pusilha (in considerable numbers), and Quirigua. As far as we know at present they are found only in the area occupied by the early Maya; an inverted triangle with its base lying between Palenque and Belize on the north, and the apex at Copan in the Republic of Honduras. And the sites where they have been discovered are situated in the east of this area-Tikal, Benque Viejo, Lubaantun, Pusilha and Quirigua. Early finds of objects of this nature were sporadic, and are not accurately documented. "British Honduras " or " Guatemala " sufficed for the time. But later expeditions, conducted under more rigorous conditions, have shown that these peculiar examples of primitive stone craft are generally associated in groups, occasionally in graves, but more often under sculptured stelve, bearing dates which can be approximately related to our own chronology. For instance, the British Museum Expedition of 1928 found a deposit of nearly one hundred " eccentric" flints and obsidians (including flakes and cores) under the base of Stela E. at Pusilha. The date of this stela is read as 9.15.0.0.0., 4 Ahau, 13 Yax, which would place it, according to the Bowditch correlation, about A.D. 202. The correlation accepted in America would place it some three hundred years later, but three hundred years is not much in the scheme of time; the study of the Maya calendar carried on by such experts as Morley, Long, Teeple, Thompson, Beyer and Spinden, will eventually lead us to an exact dating somewhere within those limits. Hitherto these stone and obsidian " eccentrics " have drifted into museums and private collections in units. But, by gift, purchase and official expeditions, the British Museum has acquired a large series, sufficient to show that these peculiar products of a Stone-Age people can be placed in definite relation artistically, and classed according to type.

The materials used by the Early Maya stone-worker are, in the main, varieties of chert, chalcedony and obsidian. The latter is a volcanic product, and I have never found it occurring naturally in any of the limestone or granite valleys of British Honduras where I have travelled, or indeed anywhere in the colony at all. It is possible that there may be deposits in the Cockscomb Mountains, but none have yet been reported. However, worked obsidian, flakes, cores and finished implements, are found throughout the colony, even on the little island, Wild Cane Cay, some fifteen miles from Punta Gorda. Probably the main supply came from Guatemala, and it is very evident that the material was an object of widespread intertribal trade. The " eccentrics," to anticipate, appear to have served no utilitarian purpose, but to be purely " ceremonial " objects. At the same time their forms bear, in many cases, a definite relation to the normal forms of spear and knife, as explained below. For this reason I illustrate, on P1. VI, a series of spearheads, hastate and tanged, of a type which appears to be typical of the Belize River. I have figured these as examples of the supreme skill of the Maya in the art of pfimary percussion. The undersides of these spearheads are unworked, showing only the natural fracture. The visible surfaces show that the artisan has split a flake from a core, so as to obtain, as far as possible, a median ridge, in order to give the weapon the necessary strength. The tangs have necessarily been worked out by later per- cussion and flaking, and, in some cases the edges and points have been trimmed by pressure, but the shape of the implement was determined by the first blow struck (e.g. P1. VI 3 c and 4 c). Technique of this class seems to be closely associated with the Belize River, as said above, especially the lower reaches and the estuary. But, as yet, we have no evidence to differentiate either in time or culture, between these simple weapons, and the highly elaborate chalcedony blades, worked on both sides by secondary pressure flaking, such as the example illustrated in P1. VI, 1 d. Most of the stone spearheads portrayed on Early Maya monuments seem, however, to conform to another type, symmetrical " laurel-leaf," to which I shall refer as " leaf-" shaped. These blades occur in numbers, and were used, no doubt interchangeably, as spears or knives. Both " hastate " and " leaf " type seem to have played a part in the development of certain types of " eccentrics." I append a short outline scheme which may be useful for reference. In doing so, I wish to make it quite clear that this scheme relates only to artistic grouping, and bears no necessary relation to the relative age of individual modifications of a type. The series which I illustrate falls, I suggest, into groups, but I do not claim that they are " developmental " in time. That contention would be impossible in view of the facts, that representatives of successive stages of artistic development often occur in the same cache; that the prototype is not always certain; and that there are numerous " cross-references" between types. I will start with what, for convenience, I call the " Blade " main type, the varieties of which seem, by artistic elaboration, to run in three directions, culminating respectively in the " Serpen- tine," the " Winged," and the " Waisted " (the last, possibly but doubtfully, linking up with the anthropomorphic forms) and the " Gruciform."</page><page sequence="4">xx Presidentic4 Address. BLADE" TYPE AND DERIVATIVES. I have already made allusion to the two main forms of utilitarian blades, " hastate" and "leaf." I do not illustrate a "leaf " utilitarian blade, because the type is well known; but P1. I, 1 a, shows an " eccentric" of the type, with serrated edges, before the " eccentricity " of 3 a is introduced; 2 a is an " eccentric " of the hastate variety, and the illustrations on P1. I, from 4 a to 4 d, show the final merging of both types, by the multiplication of alternate bilateral "notches," into what I call the " Serpentine." P1. I, 1 d to 6 d, shows a similar series in respect to obsidians.1 The " Winged " type appears to branch off from the last series at about the stage of the specimen P1. I, 8 a. A similar specimen is figured on P1. II, 1 a, and the remaining examples 2 a to 6 a indicate the typological evolution, which is in the direction of symmetry. Un- fortunately the specimens became disarranged in the studio; 5 a was turned upside-down in relation to the rest, and the whole plate was photographed in the reverse manner to which I had intended. But, I think, with a little explanation, the artistic continuity can be indicated. Suppose P1. II, 1 a, be regarded as a snake (merely for descriptive purposes), 3 a presents the same form, but the head and tail of the " snake " are brought into symmetry, and the belly becomes a kind of " crest." In 4 a the crest is developed, while the head and tail have shrunk. In 6 a the notch in the back is enclosed in a circle (owing to a convenient sponge-hole, of which the artisan has taken full advantage), and the original head and tail of the " snake " begin to assume the form of animal heads. 5 a (considered as upside-down) is the same form as 6 a, without the sponge-hole, but with the wings assuming an even more theriomorphic appearance. And 2 a stands between 4 a and 5 a. Obviously linked with these forms are the obsidians illustrated on P1. I, 7 d to 10 d; and of these, 9 d is of interest from the technological point of view, because it is fashioned, not from a flake, but from a core. The " waisted " type is not so common, but could be easily derived from the " leaf," simply by introducing two symmetrical lateral notches. Examples, both with serrated and with plain edges, are illustrated on 2 b to 5 b, and, in obsidian, on 1 d of the same plate and 6 b and 7 b of P1. III; 6 b and 7 b, approaching an anthropomorphic form, might, by the exercise of a little imagination, be reckoned as connected, but I doubt it, especially as definite anthropomorphs have been discovered, such as the magnificent specimen, formerly in the Northesk, and now in the Wellcome, Collection, a cast of which I figure on P1. V, 2 d. As comparative material, I illustrate two miniature examples in obsidian from the Toltec site of San Juan Teotihuacan in Mexico, far outside the area with which I am dealing, but connected with the Maya in so far as it was influenced by their culture. Obviously connected with the " leaf " is the " flanged " sub-type, which, instead of the bilateral notches, exhibits bilateral projections. Two are illustrated, one in P1. VI, 7 a: and another (obsidian) P1. II, 2 d. 1 Owing to difficulties involved in photography, it has been necessary to group obsidians together.</page><page sequence="5">Presidential Address. xxi The " Cruciform " sub-type might have developed from the notched " leaf," a suggestion in support of which the specimens figured on P1. II, 1 c to 7 c might be regarded as evidence. But, at the same time, it must be remembered that the cross, typifying the four " world- directions," is a common feature in Central American symbolism. "SCORPION" TYPE. The examples of this type are illustrated on P1. III, 1 a to 8 a and 1 b to 4 b (4 b represented upside-down). These specimens are worked from chert in the case of " a," and from obsidian in the case of " b." 1 b gives the clue, which leads to the puzzling forms 5 a and 6 a, by the very common process of symmetrization. It is interesting to see how the legs of the scorpion have, as it were, " crawled " up round the head and obscured the " pincers "; but the (literally) fundamental point of the creature, the curved tail, is maintained throughout. "CENTIPEDE" TYPE. The " Scorpion " may seem to merge into the " Centipede," as illustrated in P1. III, 8 b (obsidian), and P1. III, 1 c and 2 c. But I know that both these animals are well differentiated by the native Maya, and regarded with hostile respect as co-occupants of a hut, or, occasionally, bedfellows. The interesting fact is that the series of " eccentrics " shown in P1. III, 1 c to 2 d, illustrates the " shrinking " of the centipede's poisonous front legs, and he subsides into a mere serrated disc. Attention may be called to the large and boldly flaked example illustrated on P1. III, 1 d, which is a very fine specimen regarded from the point of view of technique. "ANNULETS AND CRESCENTS." Plates IV and V illustrate examples of this type in chert, and P1. II, 6 d and 8 d, crescents in obsidian. The making of a stone ring by percussion and flaking is a matter of extreme difficulty, and in many cases (such as P1. IV, figs. 2 a and 5 a) the artisan has taken advantage of a convenient sponge-hole; but in others (most notably the small specimen, P1. IV, 6 a, and the magnificent example figured on P1. V, 1 a and Fig. 2 in the text), the aperture has been definitely finished by pressure flaking. It is possible, I understand, by vertical percussion on the flat surface, to break a cone out of a flint disc, and thereby produce a central aperture which would provide the opportunity for secondary flaking. But the number of " wasters," owing to the shattering of the disc, must have been very high in proportion. And, in this respect, it is more likely that many of the " crescents " were meant to be " annulets," but went astray in the process of breaking out the central aperture. Some support to this suggestion is given by P1. IV, 1 c, which is technically an annulet, although the form approximates far more closely to a crescent with conjoined " horns." Annulets and crescents can be either plain (P1. IV, 3 a and 2 c) or serrated (P1. IV, 1 a and 5 b). The serrations, in the case of the crescents, occasionally develop into long spikes, as exemplified in the large specimen figured on P1. V, 2 b, which is shown with a crescent of more or less the normal size; and also the unique specimen,</page><page sequence="6">xxi; Presidential Address. P1. V, 1 a, to which allusion has been made above (see also text-fig. No. 1). Further evidence of the variation in size of the crescent form is illustrated on P1. IV, 1 d and 2 d. Apart from "plain " and " serrated," crescents can also be classed as "pointed" (e.g. P1. IV, I b) and "truncate (e.g. P1. IV, 4 c). x~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FIG. 2.-RCCENTRIC FLINT FROM THE CAYO DISTRICT, BRITISH HONDURAS. (L. 785 IN.). (See also PI. V a. OTHER TYPES. Occasional specimens have been found which rather defy grouping, and I figure, on PI. VII, a most remarkable example of the art of the stone-flaker. The material is chert, and, if the outlines are studied, it will be seen that the main " stem " of this forked object is fashioned in the form of a human profile, showing the artificial deformation of the forehead characteristic of the Maya. Below this, the two lateral projections (unfortunately broken) have been also flaked to represent human heads, but only the noses and lips are now apparent. A fourth human profile with elaborate headdress can be seen on the branch of the " fork " which over- hangs the face on the " stem." This most remarkable specimen, which is in private hands, is said to have been found at Quirigua.</page><page sequence="7">Presidential Address. xxiii ENGRAVED FLAKES. Quite recently, at the very early and long-occupied site of Tikal, was discovered, incor- porated in a deposit of " eccentrics," a series of engraved obsidian flakes, of a type hitherto unknown. A representative selection is illustrated on P1. VIII. These are for the most part simple flakes, without secondary trimming, except in a few instances, but engraved on the flat side with the figures of Maya Gods, in the style of the Dresden Codex, and occasional formal designs. Objects of an entirely new type are always a little open to suspicion in these days when antiquities have a marketable value. But these have been accepted by the principal Americanists. (I had the opportunity of showing them privately to individuals at the International Congress at Hamburg in 1930.) In any case the iconography is correct. The lines of engraving, viewed under magnification, show a " chattering " groove. I have experimented on obsidian, and find that it cannot be grooved with a hard steel nail-file, nor with obsidian itself. Quartz crystal will scratch it; but I obtained identical results with one of the " eccentric " flakes from Pusilha. A lapidary's wheel gives an entirely different result. The cumulative evidence suggests that these engravings were made by an artist who knew the local iconography thoroughly and was accustomed to engraving by Stone-Age methods, with chert points, that is to say an Early Maya. Personally I have no doubt of the genuineness of these specimens. According to Schelhas' classification, the deities pictured in Maya MSS. are known as God A, B, C, and so forth. Their name-glyphs have been identified almost with certainty, but there is not unanimous agreement regarding their functions. A selection of typical figures of these supernatural persons, taken from the Dresden Codex, is shown on pp. 222 and 223 of my Mexican Archceology.1 A shorter series is illustrated in the " Guide to the Maudslay Collection of Maya Sculptures " published by the British Museum. The latter series I publish here (Fig. 3) with grateful acknowledgment to the Trustees. To take the figures of the Tikal deposit individually (P1. VIII), it is clear that Nos. 1 and 11 represent the thick-lipped " God C." (See text-fig. 3.) This personage has, on rather doubtful evidence, been regarded as the god of the planet Venus. But there is no doubt of his importance, because masks representing him have been found at several sites. Notably the fine jadeite mask in the possession of Mr. Louis Clarke,2 and the equally interesting lime- stone mask, excavated by the British Museum expedition at Pusilha in 1928.3 Figs. 2 and 10 (on the plate to which reference has been made), obviously portray " God K," the prototype of the Mexican deity Eecatl, the god of the wind, with his long snouty mouth- mask, Fig. 3 is " God B," who is generally shown carrying an axe, and is probably the rain god, the predecessor of the Mexican Tlaloc. Figs. 4 and 9 appear to be " God E," the Maize-god, who bears on his head the efflorescence of the food plant which he represents. 1 London, 1914, Messrs.

Fig. 6 is clearly " God D," usually identified as Itzamna, the sky-god and prototype of the Aztec Tezeatlipoca. Fig. 12 is interesting because it represents one of the heads, which, in certain inscriptions, stand for numerals. The present example is either " one " or " eight." The two are very similar in the inscriptions on the monuments, and not easy to differentiate. But I think this is number eight." 0~~~~ A B 0 DJ E : G C FIG. 3.-MAYA GODS, FROM THE DRESDEN CODEX. SUMMARY. These "Eccentrics" suggest several problems, to which, quite frankly, I have no answer. As I have remarked above, modern intensive excavation seems to indicate that they were deposited in groups on sites of importance. Each group which I have personally handled as a group, includes every variety in every stage of construction, perfect specimens, wasters, flakes, and cores. No single specimen shows the least sign of use or wear on its edges. And the specimens in each cache were evidently deposited in " mint state." They seem, since they are usually found as foundation deposits under stelee which were erected periodically, to fall into</page><page sequence="9">Presidential Address. xxv that vague group of objects known as " votive deposits " of ceremonial significance. It is noteworthy that both the serpent and the scorpion figure prominently in the surviving codices. Technique, again, provides another aspect of interest which may well enlist the attention of those specialists who have fixed their attention on the Stone-Age of the Old World. I suggest that this subject is one of the many in which Sociologists and Technologists meet on common ground. I offer my grateful thanks to Mr. Henry Balfour and Mr. Miles C. Burkitt for their kind advice on flint technology. EXPLANATION OF PLATES.
