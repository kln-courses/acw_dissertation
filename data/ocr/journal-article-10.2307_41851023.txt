<plain_text><page sequence="1">Catesby's Owl Christoph Irmscher Indiana University It had been a long voyage. Not a tedious one, though. Every day, Mark Catesby was finding new things to admire. The ocean was alive with sharks, dolphins, porpoises. He never tired of watching them. And he ate them too. The sailors would strike at the dolphins with their poles or would catch them in nets, hauling them on board, to the loud halloos of the rest of the crew, starved for anything that was not salted meat. And while the men went after the dolphins, the dolphins in turn went after the flying fish, keeping pace with them, pursuing them for so long that, as he later wrote, "their wings tired" and they dropped back into the water, right into the jaws of their pursuers. If they escaped the dolphins, a voracious bird would grab them right out of the air. If you were a flying fish, life definitely had its challenges (Catesby, Natural History 1: iii). But then something unexpected happened. On 22 March 1722 (or 1723, if we follow the Gregorian calendar, as Catesby himself would have done), near the 26th parallel, halfway between Africa and North America, an owl appeared, hovering uncertainly over their ships. Mark Catesby knew owls well. Back home in Sudbury, the boys had been fond of running them down. The unfortunate birds would take wing once, twice, maybe a third time, and then they would give up, easy prey for rough little hands. Owls, he was sure, could not fly long distances. This owl, after some attempts to rest, disappeared. Later that same day, a hawk showed up and then, the next day, a few swallows. Those birds he knew could last. But, he wrote, "that an Owl should be able to hold out so long a flight, is to me most surprising" (Natural History 1: iii). I have been quoting from the preface to one of the most remarkable works of colonial natural history, actually in the entire annals of natural history: Mark Catesby's Natural History of Carolina , Florida &amp; the Bahama Islands , a sumptuously illustrated work consisting of 200 plates showing New World birds, snakes, turtles, insects, and mammals, along with extensive textual commentary in both English and French. The first comprehensive treatment, in image and text, of North American fauna and flora, Catesby's Natural History , one of the most expensive natural history books of the eighteenth century (Brigham 83), was also a crowning achievement in the history of printmaking. Catesby had done the engravings himself and hand-colored them. Although he claimed that a French-born "Doctor of Physick," so modest that he would not allow him to use his name, had done the French translations (Natural 153</page><page sequence="2">154 Christoph Irmscher History 1: vii), it is quite possible that he wrote even those himself. So many years of work- and yet so many questions remained, like the one about the appearance of that strange owl half-way between England and America, strange enough to be given pride of place in his preface. Was Catesby so intrigued by that animal because it also seemed like a perfect metaphor for himself, caught as he was between the Old World, where owls tire easily, and the New World, where they might do who-knows-what? At any rate, the experience was important enough for him to refer to it right on the second page of the preface to a work that ended up being as much about the things we do not know as about the things we do. The exact species of owl Catesby had seen mid-ocean remains a mystery. The owl he would have been most familiar with from Suffolk would have been the barn owl. Here is an image of a screech owl or, as Catesby knew it, a "Little Owl" (fig. 1), the New World cousin of the species the bad boys of Suffolk had hunted until the birds would collapse with exhaustion. The image appears in the first volume of the Natural History of Carolina, which took Mark Catesby six years to complete. (The second volume would preoccupy him for another decade). The bird sits firmly on a stump, its eyes trained on the viewer, as if to affirm its terrestrial mode of existence and the comfortable relationship it appears to entertain with human settlement. And yet something is off even in this picture. It is, perhaps, only a matter of scale. One would expect that lone stump to be bigger, bigger at any rate than a bird that, according to Catesby's text, is the size of a jack-daw. And then there is the penetrating look, the owl's unique, forward-facing eyes, unique at any rate in Catesby's book, where most animals, with the exception of a snake or two, are rendered in profile. They are turned directly towards the viewer, in a gesture that, precisely because it seems so anthropomorphic, suggests nothing at all, nothing shareable in human terms, that is.</page><page sequence="3">Catesby's Owl 155 Fig. 1: Noctiia Aurita Minor: The Little Owl Hand-colored engraving from Mark Catesby, Natural History 1, pl. 7. All plates from Catesby's work appear here courtesy of the Lilly Library. Catesby's unidentifiable owl will also hover over this essay, as it once did over his ship, in which I attempt to offer a new reading of Catesby's magnum opus seen through an ecocritical lens. Previous critics have chided Catesby for his obvious flaws - his "stiff and flat" representation of birds especially (Walters 44) - or they have highlighted his complicity with British imperialism or his racially tinged references to blacks and indigenous people (Meyers). In a more positive vein, others have begun to celebrate him as a kind of ecologist avant la lettre, one of the first artists to think coherently about species as engaged in intimate relationships with their environment (Wilson 123-85). All these approaches have more or less measured Catesby against the accomplishments or deficiencies of our own time, that is, against our own more accomplished ways of representing nature or our failure to honor what Rachel Carson, following Darwin, has called the web of life. They have, in my opinion, obscured what a wonderfully strange work Catesby's Natural History was and still is, one of the first sustained attempts in the Anglo-American canon to question our way of seeing nature humanly. In a sense, Catesby will also allow me to test my own eclectic brand of environmental criticism. Inspired by Lawrence Buell's musings on the "environmental imagination," I have over the years become more and more interested in the ways in which human artifacts - texts, paintings, prints, even pieces of music - challenge the notion of the human point of view as the only adequate lens through which to</page><page sequence="4">156 Christoph Irmscher view the non-human world. And yet, how can we see nature other than through human eyes? In the eyes of some, this would make me an unrepentant member of what is now often defined as the "first wave" of ecocriticism- one that is more preoccupied with the cultural artifact itself than with the questions of environmental justice it opens up. But this separation of aesthetics from politics is, as my reading of Catesby shows, an artificial and unhelpful distinction. What I would like to describe as Catesby' s uneasiness about the colonial project to which he nevertheless contributes so much is in fact intimately connected to his often fantastical portraits of the non-human world. Finally, my attempt to push beyond the boundaries of a narrow concept of "text" takes my analysis beyond even the current "second wave" of ecocriticism.1 The Design of the Whole The owl incident took place on Mr. Catesby' s second voyage to the New World, in the spring of 1622. With glowing recommendations from nurserymen and scientists back home, the Royal Society had sponsored a new trip to the colonies for one of England's most promising collectors of foreign seeds and other specimens. Although this was his second trip across the Atlantic, Catesby still had Sudbury in his blood, the medieval town south of London where he grew up. Even in his middle age, it apparently continued to irk him that he hailed from the countryside, a two days' ride away from the great metropolis with its nurseries and learned societies. The year Catesby returned from his second stint in the American colonies, Sudbury saw the birth of painter Thomas Gainsborough (1727-88). And a few decades later, the Suffolk landscape would find its best-known interpreter in another painter born there, John Constable (1776-1837). For Catesby, though, Suffolk was a dead end, an obstacle to the development of his "genus for natural history."2 He hankered after different things. The same preface that mentions the mysterious owl also contains this undisguised wail of deprivation: "The early Inclination I had to search after Plants, and other productions in nature, being much suppressed by my residing too far from London , the centre of all Science, I was deprived of all opportunities and examples to excite me to a stronger pursuit after those things to which I was naturally bent" (Natural History 1: i). Mark Catesby was born on 24 March 1682. He was also born on 3 April 1683. It all depends on whom you asked. The former date appears in the parish register at St. Nicholas, the church of a medieval village called Castle Hedingham, so named after a 110 feet-high fortification going back to the days of the Normans, a so-called motte castle, the ancestral seat of the de Veres. If the confusion surrounding Catesby's birth date is easily clarified- until 1751,</page><page sequence="5">Catesby's Owl 157 Britain was still measuring the progress of the year by the Julian calendar, according to which the new year began on 25 March- other questions surrounding Catesby's early life remain. For reasons unknown, his mother, Elizabeth Jekyll, had given birth to him in her parents' house at the south end of the village, a handsome building, now marked by a plaque. Catesby spent his youth in his parents' house in Sudbury, eight miles to the north of Castle Hedingham, a town already mentioned in the Domesday Book. His father, a lawyer of some means, had served as the town's mayor. Much of Catesby's childhood and youth is shrouded in mystery today, though we know that he went back more than one time to Castle Hedingham to visit his uncle Nicholas Jekyll' s botanical garden. We can imagine young Catesby and his friends roaming the castle grounds, chasing owls or climbing the trees along the banks of the river Stour. Though we do not know where he went to school, the Sudbury Grammar school would have been a likely place. It is not clear either when he became interested in painting or how much formal instruction, if any, he had in it.3 He must have taken advantage of whatever opportunities were offered him. He knew Latin and possibly French, and his letters as well as the descriptions in Natural History show that words for him were more than tools. Just yield yourself to the delights of Catesby's prose as it evokes the shimmering softness of the smooth, shallow water in a bay in the West Indies, "so exceeding clear, that the smallest shell may be distinctly seen at several fathom depth" (Natural History 2: 10). Catesby's first chance for a transatlantic venture came in 1712, when he accompanied his sister Elizabeth to Virginia, where she joined her husband, Dr. William Cocke, in Williamsburg. (Catesby's father, who apparently opposed Elizabeth's marriage, had passed away in 1705; ironically, Catesby used part of his inheritance to pay for his transatlantic travel). He seems to have behaved there pretty much like any other youngish gentleman let out of the cage of English provincial propriety. The bawdy diarist of Westover, Virginia planter William Byrd, recorded that Catesby could party with the best of them- one night, he said, they all got so merry together that "Mr. Catesby sang" (14 June 1712; Byrd 234). Nor were his dealings with nature shaped by notable empathy: on his walks with Byrd, he shot some snakes and a bear out of a tree where it was eating grapes (Byrd, normally not easily made squeamish, pointed out that the animal had been a mere cub). And he watched, apparently without intervening, as Byrd beat one of his slaves for sleeping on the job. In other words, there was almost nothing about Mr. Catesby that would have made him stand out in colonial society, except his love of horticulture, which allowed him to point out several possibilities for improvement in Byrd's garden. Catesby boasted that during his time in the colonies he transplanted hundreds of trees from the frontier to the gardens of</page><page sequence="6">158 Christoph Irmscher wealthy Virginians such as Byrd (Frick and Stearns 12, 91). And something else stood out about him: his restlessness. His meanderings took him as far as the West Indies. Seven years he spent in the New World, gratifying his scientific inclinations, sending some plants home, either in dried form or planted in "tubs of earth," to collectors like Samuel Dale and Thomas Fairchild, but otherwise accomplishing very little that would have been publishable ( Natural History 1: i). He claimed, with perhaps exaggerated sheepishness, in his preface to the Natural History , "I thought then so little of prosecuting a design of the Nature of this Work, that in the seven years I resided in that country, (I am ashamed to own it) I chiefly gratified my inclination in observing and admiring the various Productions of those Countries" (Natural History 1: i). We do not know when Catesby first conceived of the idea of a comprehensive work on American natural history. There is evidence that, for a while, he contemplated a trip to Africa. Fortunately, a group of collectors impressed by the tubs he had sent home from his first American sojourn, combined their efforts to send him back to the colonies again. Catesby' s sponsors included England's foremost botanist, Dr. William Sherard, as well as the Royal Society, whose president, Sir Hans Sloane, was no doubt intrigued by the fact that Catesby had been to Jamaica, one of Sloane' s many fields of interest. After Catesby had left for his second voyage, it seems that soon all he could think about was his book. On 15 August 1724, he wrote to Hans Sloane, who had apparently asked for some sketches of New World fauna and flora: "My design was Sir [...] to keep my Drawingfs] entire that I may get them Graved, in order to give a general History of the Birds and other Animals which to distribute separately would wholly frustrate that designe, and be of little value to those who would have so small fragments of the whole."4 The "design of the whole" -that was what Catesby was after now. By 1726, he was back in England, putting his nose to the grindstone, producing plate after plate. He was the first naturalist to pick folio-sized paper for his prints because he wanted to be able to reproduce at least some of the birds and other animals he had seen in their natural size. The cost of the project exceeded Catesby' s budget. Again a benefactor, the Quaker milliner Peter Collinson, had to step in. But Catesby was able to gather 160 subscribers or "encouragers," as he called them in the list he included in his Natural History. They would, he promised, receive ten parts of twenty plates each, for the price of two guineas a part. By the time he was finally finished, in 1742, Catesby was sixty years old. The Natural History had become his life's work. In 1746 an appendix of twenty plates followed, based on specimens sent to him mostly by John Bartram, the eminent Philadelphia botanist. Catesby was done. Touchingly it was then that</page><page sequence="7">Catesby's Owl 159 he, by now an old man, finally got married. Two years later, shortly before Christmas 1749, he died. His wife apparently knew the value of his work; in her will, written a couple of years later, she named as her primary asset a second volume of the Natural History , which she left to her brother-in-law "to make his sett compleat" (Frick and Stearns 49). Nature's Parts The Natural History of Carolina is an unimaginably gorgeous work. At Indiana University's Lilly Library, where I do most of my research, I have daily access to a second edition, completed in 1751 by Catesby's disciple George Edwards. It was subsequently owned by book collector extraordinaire Josiah. K. Lilly. Turning its pages is a feast for the senses, delight of the first order. Consider the sheer weight of the volumes, the luminous color of the plates, the beautifully ornamented capitals at the beginning of the descriptions, the size of the pages, which do not seem so enormous anymore only because Catesby's attentive successor, John James Audubon, wanted to best him and had his birds printed on double-elephant folio-sized sheets. Maybe it is indeed because of Audubon that historians of art and scientific illustrations have been a little muted in their response to Catesby's work.5 Critics point to the conspicuous flaws in Catesby's work, for example, the often outrageous combination of backgrounds - as in one of his most frequently reproduced plates, which features an intensely red and decidedly un-pink flamingo standing against the incongruous background of a fantastical coral tree, which Catesby could not have known is not a plant.6 Catesby did know that "coralline Plants" grew in the water, not outside of it, which makes his representation even more puzzling.7 Though he was not yet familiar with the term, Catesby basically knew what a "habitat" was. Other plates in the Natural History feature the birds with the berries they feed on or the fish they devour. In fact, Catesby's obvious awareness of the connections between organisms and their environment or food sources found its way into his preface where he explains that he usually painted his birds and that "where it could be admitted, I have adapted the Birds to those Plants on which they fed, or have any relation to" (Natural History V. vi). Based on Catesby's experience in the field, and Catesby's own illustrations such as plate 15, which shows a blue jay sitting on a branch of smilax, Amy Meyers concludes that by the time Catesby had begun to work on the first plates of his Natural History , "It is clear [...] he had fully committed himself to the depiction of the ways in which he believed flora and fauna to be associated in their natural habitats" and that he "determined his basic compositional approach to the creation of such pictures" (Meyers 234).</page><page sequence="8">160 Christoph Irmscher Fig. 2: Caput Phoenicopteri Naturalis Magnitudinis : The Bill of the Flamingo in Its full Dimensions, from Catesby, Natural History 1, pl. 74. But had he? What, then, are we to make of the famous image of the bison rubbing against a rose acacia, a tree Catesby himself admits he only encountered once, in the Appalachian Mountains (Natural History 2, Appendix, pl. 20)? And what about those other confusing images where Catesby features dismembered birds, decapitated heads floating in space or on water, which are almost scary in their intensity: yet another flamingo posed in front of a coral, though this time we only see the bird's head (Natural History 1, pl. 74; fig. 2); a northern ganneťs head rising from the bottom of the sea or a river, with a white mangrove draped around the base of its neck; the severed neck and head of a Canada Goose laid over a background of a species Catesby merely identifies as a chrysanthemum, but which is more likely the rong-bush, Wedelia bahamensis, a plant that grows in the coastal thickets of the Caribbean- not where we would normally see Canada geese (Natural History 1, pl. 92).8 Added sources of confusion for modern readers are the texts that accompany the plates. The fact that they exist in two different languages is only the beginning.9 What are these texts? Mini-essays? Field notes? Scientific</page><page sequence="9">Catesby's Owl 161 descriptions? Apart from the preface and a longer, ambitious essay on the "Account of Carolina and the Bahama Islands" (inserted into the first volume in the Lilly copy), Catesby's Natural History consists exclusively of plates with accompanying notes or prose vignettes. Fragmentary and unpredictable, most of these texts are marked by an almost deliberate avoidance of what makes a narrative a narrative. Take the following throwaway sentence from the description of the great crested flycatcher: "This Bird by its ungrateful brawling noise, seems at variance and displeased with all others" (Natural History 1: 52). There are certainly the outlines of a story here - one that lets us suspect that Catesby was so irritated by the loudness of this colorful flycatcher's call that he reimagined it as being at war with the entire avian world. The great crested flycatcher is an aggressive bird, to be sure, though not more so than the blue jay or the mockingbird (both earn high praise from Catesby). As it stands, Catesby's sentence provides us only glimpses of his motivation for arriving at such a verdict. Only rarely does Catesby allow himself to become a character in his own book. When he does appear- as someone who has listened to someone else's stories or as someone who can corroborate that a certain bird or fruit tastes good because he too has eaten of it- we realize what is missing from other sections. A few times, we even see him actively handling the species he collects, plucking little sucker-fish off the body of a shark- "It required great strength to separate them" ( Natural History 2: 26) - or dissecting the stomach of a loggerhead turtle, in which he finds pieces of broken shells. In one particularly memorable instance, one of the few where a memory is extended into something like a story in its own right, Catesby describes how he was sitting outdoors, enjoying a "sultry evening" somewhere in Virginia or Carolina. A member of his party was smoking a pipe and dropped some hot ashes on the ground, which were immediately gobbled up by a little frog, which provides an occasion for more experimentation: "This put us upon tempting him with a red-hot wood-coal, not less than the end of ones finger, which he also swallowed greedily; thus afterwards I always found one or other of them cagily deceived in this manner." Catesby concludes that these "frogs"- common American toads- were under the impression that the burning ashes or coal pieces were fireflies, their preferred food ( Natural History 2: 69). For the most, however, Catesby, in his own narrative, is mostly an ear or a mouth, not a naturalist who is, or wants to be, fully in control of his material. "I don't remember," he writes about a species of coral he has observed, "in what manner these grow, whether erect or lying on the ground, I rather think the latter from its flexibility and weightiness of its branches" (Natural History 2: 21).</page><page sequence="10">1 62 Christoph Irmscher Catesby was, as he told Hans Sloane, worried about the "design of the whole." He had reason to be: the information he was gathering for his book (the local details, the observations he made on the spot, the information he gleaned from others) refused to fit effortlessly into the "design of the whole." His work as a collector did not help: he constantly found himself sending dried skins or, worse, parts of specimens to his sponsors, the head of a gannet, for example, or the head of an oyster-catcher, or the head of a hooded merganser (see Natural History 1: pl. 94).10 Catesby sometimes did not conceal his irritation with Sloane: responding to Sloane' s order to send him drawings, he testily pointed out that if he were expected to do so he would have to make duplicates of each of these sketches, since he required them for his own work. He would end up sending fewer fresh specimens to Sloane, if he were forced to send him drawings as well.11 But the real difficulty did not come from the collectors' incessant demands. Catesby was dealing with a more general problem. As he tried to grasp the design of the whole, reminders of the limits of human understanding kept popping up. For example, a matter that bothered him to no end was the migration of birds. "Whence they come, and where they breed, is to me unknown," he writes plaintively about the blue heron, in a deliberately inverted sentence, which occupies a paragraph of its own (Natural History 1: 76). An alternative, less artful version of the same sentence might have been: "I do not know whence they come and where they breed." By letting the sentence end with unknown and by relegating the subject of potential (un- )knowledge to a prepositional phrase ("to me"), Catesby succeeds in expressing both his personal disappointment as well as a larger truth - that this world does not exist for the benefit of the human observer. Birds come and go, and we get only glimpses of their lives- just as Catesby saw his owl come out of nowhere and leave soon into that same nowhere. The story of avian migration became more complicated because of the intervention of humans. Bobolinks, for example, came to Carolina in September, just when the rice fields were ready for ravaging. Once, lying on deck of a ship near Andros Island in the Bahamas, Catesby saw these "rice-birds," as he called them, passing in the sky and immediately assumed that, having exhausted the rice fields in Cuba, they were now on their way to Carolina, "an easy Morning's Ride," to quote Emily Dickinson's hyperbolic phrase about the hummingbird's migration.12 One can imagine how Catesby, prostrate on the rough planks of his ship, followed these birds with his eyes. To them, distances posed no problem. Yesterday they were in Cuba; the day after tomorrow they would be feasting on rice in Carolina (Natural History 1: 14). And there were so many other things he simply did not know: why, for example, did sharks not eat the little pilchards, the small fish that constantly hovered near their mouths? What</page><page sequence="11">Catesby's Owl 163 did the female of the laughing gull look like? And why were fish of the same species poisonous in some parts of the Bahamas and not in others? And why, oh why were there no observers "nice enough" to tell him what kind of a plant the Indians of Carolina had been seen using to protect themselves against the bite of the rattlesnake ( Natural History 35)? While Catesby was hunting after nature's parts -sending New World fauna and flora home piecemeal, carefully wrapped and crated- nature itself, as if to mock his efforts, would occasionally make fragments of itself. A flood he witnessed in September 1722 at Fort Moor on the Savannah River made a big impression on him. The water rose, he remembered, 29 feet in less than forty hours: "It came rushing down the river so suddenly, and with that impetuosity that it not only destroyed all their grain, but sweeped away and drowned the cattle belonging to the garison. Islands were formed, and others joined to the land" ("Account," Natural History 1: vii). In some places, the course of the river seemed reversed. In this topsy-turvy world, all that was left to Catesby was to survey the damage: "A large and fertile tract of low land, lying on the south side of the river, opposite to the Fort, which was a former settlement of the Savannah Indians, was covered with sand three feet in depth, and made unfit for cultivation. [...] Panthers, Bears and Deer, were drowned, and found lodged on the limbs of trees." Once this had been Indian land, but now the traces of white settlement were being erased too. Even reptiles and insects were affected by the upheaval, thrown out of their holes and nests and "violently hurried away." They ended up dismembered, beaten into pieces and mixed with harder matter: "Their fragments (after the waters fell) were seen in many places to cover the ground." Catesby realized, the hard way, that whatever arrangements we make as to putting animals, plants, and people where we think they ought belong and whatever arrangements we think nature has made are temporary. Every Feather And so Catesby, frustrated in his efforts to capture the design of the whole, turns instead to a better understanding of detail, of nature's minutiae. The same writer who had announced, in his preface, that he had no intention of describing a bird's every feather, settled in, quill in hand, and often did just that. Writing about the "summer duck" (wonderfully named Anas Americanus cristatus elegans - a. wood duck, as we would say prosaically today), a bird of "a mean Size, between the common Wild Duck and Teal," his eye glides over the bird's body feather by feather, caressing it as a cascade of words pours down the page (fig. 3).</page><page sequence="12">164 Christoph Irmscher The bill is red, with a black spot on the middle of it, and a black nail or horny substance on the end, the basis of the bill is edged about with a yellow fleshy protuberance, pointing on each Side towards the eyes, the Irides of which are very large and red, encompassed with a red circle. The crown of the head is elegantly covered with a double plume of long feathers composed of blue, green and purple colours, hanging down separately behind its head, and divided by a narrow white line, extending from the upper part of the basis of the bill backward: the lower plume is likewise bordered with a white line, beginning at the eyes and running parallel with the other, dividing the plume from the under part of the head, which is purple. The throat is white, from each side whereof proceed two white lines, one branching up towards the crown of the head, and the other below it, crossing the neck. The breast is of a muddy red, sprinkled thick over with white spots, like ermine. A little above the shoulder is a broad white line, extended transversely, below which, and joining to it, runs a broad black lift. The back and upper parts of the wings are variously and changeably coloured with brown, blue, and purple. The small feathers near the vent, are of a reddish purple, from amongst which spring two small yellow feathers. The tail is blue and purple. (Natural History 1: 97). Relying on numerous present participles ("pointing/' "hanging down," "extending," " running," "branching") as well as on the repetition of color adjectives, such as "red" and "white," his description animates the bird- but only up to a point. His hand leads the pen as it would touch the feathers of the bird, tracing the circles and lines and "lifts" that create patterns on its plumage. Before he is even done, Catesby also acknowledges that his language cannot freeze the bird into iconic silence. What he has just recreated for the reader may indeed vary when the bird moves again. So far the bird seems to have compliantly sat still for its portrait, but by the end of the passage Catesby releases it again, a reminder that what we have read and seen is an arrangement made by the human imagination, an attempt to animate on the page what in nature moves on its own. The lower part or verge of the wings are lapped over and covered by the small downy side feathers, extending from the shoulders halfway the wings, displaying alternately and in a wonderful manner black and white pointed lines, varying in appearance according to the motion of the Bird, and different position it puts its feathers into, which adds much to the beauty of it. (Natural History 1: 97)</page><page sequence="13">Catesby's Owl 165 Fig. 3: Anas Americanus cristatus elegans: The Summer Duck ; from Catesby, Natural History 1, pl. 97. After so much wonder, the end of the passage comes as an anticlimax, but one that Catesby seems to have carefully orchestrated: "The sides of the body below the wings are brown, with transverse waved lines, as in many of the Duck kind; the legs and feet of a reddish brown" (Natural History 1: 97). The reminder that this bird shares features with the rest of the "Duck kind" does not qualify the eruption of line and color the passage has just attached to it; rather, it highlights what is so unique about the "summer duck," one of those birds that, come fall, will vanish from human view. Visual Play Certainly, Catesby's image of the wood duck is one of his less spectacular or odd ones. One sees no outrageous background, dismembered body parts, nor pseudo-plants without any discernible relation to the animal depicted. As in many of the more conventional natural history illustrations at the time, the faintly delineated rock serves as a kind of pedestal for a bird whose strange beauty Catesby must have felt does not need any particular staging. Things are a little different in one of Natural History's more memorable images, a plate</page><page sequence="14">166 Christoph Irmscher overwhelming in its funkiness which shows a puffer fish- most likely Spheroides testudineus, or a checkered puffer- beneath a tree and a climbing plant (fig. 4). Here the image rather than the text tells the story. It dramatizes the process of seeing. The "tapered" (Catesby' s own phrase) leaves of the black torch, called "Cornus" by Catesby, and the elongated pod of the climbing plant create an effective contrast with the globular shape of the puffer fish. The tree's tiny, similarly colored fruit further highlights the fish's odd shape, which is, as Catesby states in the accompanying description, the most remarkable thing about it. So many leaves, but only one fish. Though nothing goes together here, the image jolts us into awareness: how outrageous this fish is after all! It is not clear whether or not Catesby knew how toxic puffers are; his rendering is virtually identical with a watercolor of the same species by John White, a copy of which Catesby would have found in an album owned by Hans Sloane (see Sloan 194-95). But White's fish is floating, contextless, in empty space; there is none of the weird botanicals to offset its outrageous shape that we find in Catesby. Fig. 4: Orbis Laevis Variegatus: The Globe Fish, from Catesby, Natural History 2, pl. 28.</page><page sequence="15">Catesby's Owl 167 It is possible that Catesby, while working on his magnum opus , had at least heard about, if not seen, the images produced by a variety of engravers and colorists for the Dutch pharmacist and naturalist Albertus Seba, a famous collector of natural curiosities. Seba's name was well-known to many of Catesby's contemporaries, including Linnaeus, who relied on several of Seba' s specimens for the descriptions in Systema naturae. Whether Catesby had seen Seba's first volume or not, the Dutch naturalist's unabashedly baroque work provides an interesting contrast with the intellectually and visually more concentrated power of Catesby's images. Unlike Seba's often bizarre combinations, Catesby's juxtapositions do not serve primarily decorative purposes. Here is a plate from the first volume of Seba's Thesaurus that shows a papyrus plant, the paper mulberry (now considered an invasive species in the United States), spread out over two pages, with a small Japanese water snake featured at the bottom of the page. We are thus confronted with two species that would be found in proximity to each other only in a naturalist's Wunderkammer (fig. 5). Compare this composition with a plate in Catesby's second volume, featuring a bluish green snake wrapped around a French mulberry (fig. 6). This time, Catesby's composition is less about "seeing round" than about "seeing green," a color Catesby acknowledges in his preface is very difficult to reproduce. There is, he writes, "no degree of Green but what some Plants are possess' d of at different times of the year" (Catesby, Natural History 1: vii). In the animal world, the Carolina parakeet seems "green" only to a casual observer: "Upon nearer scrutiny the interior vanes of most of the wing-feathers are dark-brown: the upper-parts of the exterior vanes of the larger wing or quill-feathers, are yellow, proceeding gradually deeper colour' d to the end, from yellow to green, and from green to blue" (Catesby, Natural History 1: 11). In the case of the particular snake represented here, green is not just green. Its color inclines, says Catesby, "more to blue than yellow" (Natural History 2: 47). Seba's snake rests comfortably at the bottom of the picture, but Catesby's snake turns and twists around the mulberry branch just as his leaves turn and twist, too.</page><page sequence="16">168 Christoph Irmscher Fig. 5: Broussonecia papyrifera, Hoinalopsis buccata ; from Seba, Thesauri description 1, pl. 28 (1734).

Once the viewer knows where to look and how to look, Catesby's infinite cross-referencing of shapes and colors reveals itself. One sees how the hard, round black berries of the darling plum comment on the round, black eye of the crane, whereas the tree's scrappy branches highlight the sheer solidity of the bird's beak (Natural History 1, pl. 75). Likewise, the branches of the coral - over, under, and above the flamingo's head in fig. 2- make us take another look at the bird's beak, which is much bigger and more important than the bird's head. Catesby's composition has an almost abstract effect: instead of normalizing the bird's shape and color, it draws attention to it. The flamingo's bill, says Catesby, quoting a description by naturalist Nehemiah Grew, is "truly hyperbolical" - a deliberate pun, it seems, which refers both the beak's shape and its sheer outrageousness.13 Next to the massive hyperbolical branch</page><page sequence="18">1 70 Christoph Irmscher of the Flamingo's beak, the "branches" of the coral recede as merely parts of an ornamental pattern. Later naturalists learned from Catesby' s visual play, the witty echoes that establish correspondences between specimen and background. Audubon loved them, as did his unjustly forgotten son John Woodhouse Audubon (1812-62), who, in this plate from the Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America, invites us to contemplate the similarities between the pointy, elongated shape of the Armadillo's ears and the leaves of the aloe plant in the background (fig. 7).14 John Woodhouse Audubon, painting around the middle of nineteenth century, succeeds where Catesby still has trouble- he fills the canvas, creating a densely textured composition, making both the armadillo's skin and the leaves of the plant palpable.

Courtesy of the Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington "M.C." I have been arguing that Catesby, realizing the impossibility of seeing things in their proper contexts, instead draws our attention to, and delights in showing us, the provisional contexts that we make when we see things. Image and text work together in this process. Catesby highlights this interpénétration of text and image- as well as his own agency in making his illustrations what</page><page sequence="19">Catesby'sOwl 171 they are- by including his initials in many of his plates, in increasingly ornate form. Catesby's initials first show up in his plate of the yellow-bellied woodpecker ( Natural History 1, pl. 21): a simple fusion of "M" and "C" appears next to the tree. But over the course of his work on his Natural History , they get more elaborate, a statement of artistic pride and authorship rather than a mere maker's mark. Often the "MC" simply drifts in empty space, putting itself in close proximity to a species name, mocking the rigidity of the typeface used. Sometimes it floats in the water (Natural History 1, pl. 98) or sits on the rocky ground of an island (Natural History 1, pl. 99). But then we also see it in the mouth of a Margate fish (fig. 8); attached to the stalks of plants or the end of the branch of a maple (Natural History 1, pl. 62); tucked away in the roots of the trillium, whose fine-filigreed structure it imitates (Natural History 1, pl. 50); or hanging from a twig of swamp honeysuckle (Natural History 1, pl. 57). Fig. 8: Detail from Perca Marina Gibbosa Cinerea: The Margate Fish; from Catesby, Natural History 2, pl. 2. If they merely appeared in the margins of his prints, we could say that the purpose of Catesby's initials was to authenticate the image, to identify it as the product of "MC"' s artistic effort. But then there are those plates in which the "MC" enters the space of the composition itself, and the boundaries between the artist and his image, between nature and art become fluid. Appearing in the mouth of one of his fish, growing out of the roots of one of his plants, or dangling from the branch of one of his shrubs, "MC" enters the world of his</page><page sequence="20">1 72 Christoph Irmscher plates, accepting that, like one of his fish, they might devour him. Rather than intruding on the world of plants, birds, and fish, the wandering "MC" compensates for what, as a printmaker, he inevitably destroys. In Catesby's world, making images of things was roughly equivalent to taking things, which was precisely what Catesby did for a living. As a collector of seeds, he was actively contributing to the colonialist enterprise, putting plants into ever new contexts - the nurseries and private gardens of wealthy collectors. Many entries in the Natural History refer to the plants now flourishing on the estates of Mr. Collinson in Peckham, Mr. Fairchild in Hoxton, or Mr. Gray in Fulham. The ships visible in the background of the plate showing "The Noddy," one of the few signs of direct human presence in Catesby's plates seem ominous, harbingers of a more permanent displacement than any flood can accomplish. Noddies are, he writes in the accompanying text, so trusting or, from Catesby's human point of view, "stupid" that they "will suffer themselves to be laid hands on and taken from off the yards or parts of the Ships on which they alight" (Natural History 1: pl. 88). Unlike the ships, "MC" has come to stay, if only in the world of his plate, a world where the pieces still can be made to speak to each other. But the very fact that the "M" and "C" became ever more ornamental over time highlights how artificial, how fantastical that rapprochement between the human and the natural is. The "design of the whole" -emerging from the parts of his volume Catesby sent out to his subscribers over a period of 17 years- is the printmaker' s, not nature's, design. Nature's fragments will not cohere for the human observer- a fact that may perhaps become more evident to the colonialist abroad with conquest on his mind, than to the observer at home. Catesby already glimpsed what George Perkins Marsh observed more than a hundred years later: "Man is everywhere a disturbing agent" (Marsh 36). For Catesby, there is an analogy between the displacement caused by the colonial enterprise (which makes trees native to South Carolina grow in Mr. Fairchild's garden) and his own alienation as a natural observer in the New World who cannot make sense, on the page before him, of all the things he sees. Catesby is never overtly critical of colonialism as such. He will stand idly by while his host beats his slaves, and he is none too perturbed as he notes the diminishment of the indigenous people as a result of the diseases the ships from Europe have brought with them. If Catesby does not advocate for slaves or indigenous tribes, this reticence has to do with a general skepticism about the way humans interact with their environments. Catesby's often bizarre arrangements- the severed heads, dead birds, crazy plants- are, in my reading, acknowledgements of the inevitable distance between humans and nature, one that colonialism cannot but make worse. But</page><page sequence="21">Catesby' s Owl 173 Catesby already knew that we cannot see nature other than through human eyes. Even the Indians, whom Catesby characterized as irremediably savage but kind, ultimately cannot claim to be much closer to understanding the "design of the whole." In a wry aside borrowed from his main source on Indian affairs, John Lawson, Catesby describes how they would dress up as deer for hunting purposes and end up shooting each other: "In these habilements an Indian will approach as near a deer as he pleases, the exact motion or behaviour of a deer being so well counterfeited by them, that it has been frequently known for two hunters to come up with stalking heads together, and unknown to each other, so that an Indian has been kill' d instead of a deer" ( Natural History 1: "Account," p. xii). Compare these ill-fated attempts to "counterfeit" animals with those rare moments of surprise Catesby knew all about: moments when a creature we thought we knew (say, an owl, of the very kind we remember from our childhood) materializes in a place where we think it does not belong and then leaves we do not know for what; moments in which we are reminded that there are limits to our mastery - colonial, artistic, scientific, and otherwise; moments in which we suddenly realize that it is we who do not belong. Notes 1. For the distinction between " first " and "second-wave" environmentalism see Buell, Environmental Critidsm 21-28. Even Buell's most recent definition of environmental criticism- an invitation to think of " environmentality" as the property of "any text" (Environmental Criticism 25)- remains indebted to the humanistic understanding that words say more than any image For an attempt to apply ecocritical analysis to works of American art, see Alan Braddock and Christoph Irmscher, "Introduction." 2. This turn of phrase comes from Catesby' s disciple George Edwards, the librarian at the Royal College of Physicians, who obviously meant "genius," an amusing slip for a natural historian. See Jackson 76. 3. In 1724, when Catesby wants to discuss the possibility of a new trip to Mexico with Sloan, he is still contemplating bringing "A Painter" from London or, failing that, Amsterdam or Paris with him, and this despite the fact that in the same letter he, for the first time, takes pride in his drawings and their importance for his work as a whole (Catesby to Hans Sloane, 15 August 1724, Sloane ms. 4047, fol. 212-13). Thanks to the staff at the British Library for making Catesby7 s correspondence with Sloan available to me. 4. Catesby to Sloane, 15 August 1724, Sloane ms. 4047, fol. 212-13. 5. In a recent interview for the Audubon Magazine Blog , Robert Robertson, formerly of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, expresses doubt that Audubon "actually saw Catesby' s illustrations" (Leihbach). But there is in fact evidence that Audubon had seen Catesby' s plates. His Mangrove Cuckoo (pl. 169 in the Double Elephant Folio edition of Birds of America) appears perched on a branch of a seven-year-apple shrub which the corresponding text in Audubon's Ornithological Biography explains is also featured in plate 59 of Catesby' s Natural History, an image of the "Bahama Titmouse" (Audubon 391). The plant for</page><page sequence="22">1 74 Christoph Irmscher Audubon's plate was drawn by George Lehman; the similarities between Lehman's and Catesby's renderings are obvious. In a letter written to John Bachman on 4 October 1837, Audubon also reports that "Old Catesby did publish the Rocky Mountain blue bird of Nuttall," a reference to plate 47 in Catesby's Natural History (Audubon, Writings and Drawings 845). Even in the early 1840s, when he was drafting biographies for his projected edition of the Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America, he takes care to mention his predecessor Catesby, making specific references to his plates: "The original Sciurus niger of Catesby is the black variety of the Fox Squirrel" (Audubon, "Sciurus niger, Linn.," John James Audubon Collection, C0006, Box 1, folder 6, Special Collections, Princeton University Library). 6. The French physician and naturalist Jean- André de Peysonnel was the first to discover, in 1725, that corals responded to touch like animals. Peysonnel shared his findings with the Académie des Sciences in 1725, though he had to wait to receive credit for his discovery until 1753 when an abridged form of a longer treatise on corals that he had written was published in the Transactions of the Royal Society.
