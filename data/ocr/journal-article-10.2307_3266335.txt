<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Biblical Literature nine stylistic features in Group A, sixty-five in Group B, and sixty-two in Group C. These three groups are labels of convenience to congregate stylistic features in descend- ing order of importance. Most of the rest of the book lists these stylistic features with critical notes, and then classifies them in various ways. For example, part of chapter 6 indexes the stylistic features against each verse in John; another part plots them against each pericope. The strongly worded conclusion of Ruckstuhl and Dschulnigg is that one writer wrote all of the Fourth Gospel, or that if parts of it sprang from discrete sources the reworking of the material is so thorough that the existence of discrete sources is simply not provable. In many ways this book is a delight to read. The aim is clear and the method well executed. Numerous charts summarize a great deal of useful material, and the authors take pains to stop now and then and review the evidence and its significance. Apart from a selected subject index and an alphabetical listing of the stylistic features in John (with page references), there are no indexes. But the strengths of the book are also its weaknesses. Ruckstuhl and Dschulnigg do not probe very far outside German literature. For instance, they do not mention D. Moody Smith's book, and they do not refer to numerous articles in French and English (to go no further) that bear on their theme. For instance, they do not cite the impor- tant essays by Vern Poythress on intersentence conjunctions in John (NovT 26 [1984] 312-40; WTJ 46 [1984] 350-69). More importantly, they focus so narrowly on stylistic features peculiar to John that their argument, important as it is, lacks nuance. What are we to make, for instance, of the 150 words that the evangelist places on Jesus' lips that are not found elsewhere in the Fourth Gospel- a list published in H. R. Reynolds's commentary in 1906? Although I am in entire sympathy with the conclusions advanced by Ruckstuhl and Dschulnigg, and warmly welcome this addition to the literature, I wonder if questions of source criticism and the uniformity of the style can be adequately handled on so narrow a basis. Donald A. Carson Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, IL 60015 Sophia and the Johannine Jesus, by Martin Scott. JSNT Sup 71. Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992. Pp. 276. ?35.00/$57.50 (?26.00/$42.95 subscriber). This book, originally a 1990 University of Durham dissertation under James D. G. Dunn, grew out of contemporary questions concerning the role of women in the Chris- tian community. Noting the influence of wisdom traditions on Johannine Christology, Scott seeks to identify the impact of the feminine gender of the personified figure of wisdom, Sophia, on the Johannine portrait of Jesus and women. The investigation begins by exploring the role of gender in goddess worship and in the development of the feminine wisdom figure in Israel's thought. Acknowledging that biblical writers unequivocally condemned the polytheistic cults of neighboring peoples. Scott tries to show the "limitations of this exclusive, patriarchal attitude," point- ing out that such cultic practices reflect a universal need for revitalization which includes both masculine and feminine principles, in contrast to the "male God, Yahweh," who "existed in splendid isolation" and "created 'his' own without the assistance of afeminine principle" (pp. 46-47). In Proverbs, Sophia is said to replace God in many respects, her gender personifyng God's appeal to men; but Sirach, with his "negative, male- 152</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews chauvinistic attitude towards women" (p. 78), attempts to control women's influence and to confine the feminine Sophia to the manageable limits of a book, the impersonal Torah. The Wisdom of Solomon presents Sophia as a feminine replacement for God, a figure neither dependent on nor subordinate to Yahweh, but Philo is said to mount a concerted effort "to strip Sophia of her feminine influence; largely because of his antipathy toward that gender group and his inherent sense of supremacy of all that is male, including God 'himself" (p. 61). Throughout this section there is a curious lack of attention to biblical criticism of the notion that God is a male. The idea that God could not be imaged in the form of any created being was basic to Israel's faith, and the prophets attacked the cults' male deities like Baal as forcefully as they rejected goddess worship. Some passages in Sirach do evince negative attitudes toward women, and Sirach does locate wisdom's tabernacle in the Torah; but it is at least questionable to think that his portrayal of wisdom-which includes her performing priestly service and pouring forth rivers of understanding (Sirach 24)-should be construed negatively as confinement. Philo's concept of God was not the deification of maleness; he stressed divine transcendence, abhorred anthropomorphism, and as a designation for God preferred the neuter 6o ov to the masculine 6 xSv used in Exod 3:14 LXX. The third chapter explores the impact of the feminine personification of wisdom on the Johannine presentation of Jesus. Scott explores the many connections between wisdom traditions and the prologue, arguing that the text describes the ministry of Sophia through 1:12 and that Jesus' earthly ministry begins in 1:14. He concludes that the use of the masculine word logos in the prologue "is largely a cover for the gender problem surrounding the identification of Jesus with the female Sophia" (p. 115). The remainder of the chapter explores the role of wisdom in the body of the Gospel, such as the transfer to Jesus of images traditionally used for wisdom, such as bread, light, and the vine. Other similarities include descent from above, revelation, and intimacy with God. Although the Fourth Gospel repeatedly presents this intimacy as that of Father and Son, Scott suggests that the evangelist used masculine language because the historical Jesus was a male who called God "Abba" in prayer. Nevertheless, Scott contends that the Johannine Jesus is "a unique blend of the male and female"; he "is a man who exhibits all the characteristic traits of the woman Sophia" (p. 174). Few would deny that wisdom traditions contribute significantly to Johannine Christology and that the impact of these traditions extends beyond the prologue. Scott's elevation of wisdom to a position of primacy, however, is more problematic. The Johan- nine portrait of Jesus fuses and recasts multiple christological strains, including Davidic and prophetic understandings of Jesus' identity along with wisdom traditions. When each of these elements is given due weight it becomes difficult to speak of"Jesus Sophia" as Scott does. Moreover, the repeated references to Jesus' relationship to God as that of Father and Son make it implausible to think that readers can be expected to under- stand it in feminine terms. Scott rightly cautions against taking Jesus' maleness as "an ontological statement about the nature of God" (p. 171), but his arguments for an androgynous Christology and theology remain unconvincing. The fourth chapter seeks to correlate this claim with the portrayal of women in John's Gospel. He suggests that Jesus' mother was confident that Jesus could provide wine at Cana, since Sophia was said to be a source of wine (Prov 9:5; cf. Sir 24:21), and that by telling the servants what to do she assumed a leadership role. Although 153</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Biblical Literature these observations are helpful, the repeated attempts to contrast the activity of Jesus' mother with the passivity of his disciples minimize the disciples' active role in the section leading up to Cana (e.g., John 1:41, 45). The discussion of the Samaritan woman rightly accents her role as a witness to her townspeople, though playing down the tentativeness in her words (4:29). Martha's confession of faith in Jesus (11:27) is rightly identified as representative of the Johannine community's confession (cf. 20:31), though the argument that by her words she replaces Peter is less than convincing. Scott's most helpful remarks pertain to John 12. He notes that if true discipleship means "serving," it is Martha who exemplifies such service (diakonein, 12:2, 26). Similarly, if Jesus washed his disciples' feet to demonstrate the kind of service they were to perform for each other (13:14-15), Mary anointed Jesus' feet even before he had called his followers to such tasks (11:2; 12:3). Thus in John 12 both Martha and Mary epitomize discipleship. Attention is also given to Jesus' mother at the cross and Mary Magdalene at the tomb. Scott is certainly right that the women in the Gospel illustrate what discipleship means from a Johannine perspective and that attention needs to be given to women's roles in Johannine community life. Nevertheless, when Scott concludes that John places women in "the central position" while leaving the men "on the margin" (p. 238) he fails adequately to account for the attention given to the man born blind and the Beloved Disciple as major examples of discipleship. Early in his study Scott noted that there is often no clear connection between worship of a feminine deity and high regard for women in community life (p. 49). This caution is well-taken. The Fourth Gospel portrays Christian community in a remarkably egalitarian way, which can make an important contribution to contemporary Christian life; yet this pattern does not seem to stem from an androgynous portrayal of Jesus or God. Craig R. Koester Luther Theological Seminary, St. Paul, MN 55108 Historiography and Self-Definition: Josephos, Luke-Acts and Apologetic Historiography, by Gregory E. Sterling. NovTSup 64. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1992. Pp. xvi + 500. Gld. 220/$125.75. This ambitious project, a revision of Sterling's 1989 Graduate Theological Union dissertation under John R. Donahue, illustrates the way in which NT scholars often come to adopt classical studies as a second home. Sterling set out to clarify the genre of Luke-Acts. Noting similarities with Josephus's Antiquities, he then discovered that the genre of the latter had not been adequately explained. That led him in turn to a detailed examination of Josephus's literary precursors. In the process, he discovered a whole new genre: apologetic historiography (p. 3). Of its 393 text pages, the present book devotes about eighty pages each to Josephus and Luke-Acts; the bulk of the study aims at establishing the new genre, which both the Jewish and the Christian work are said to exemplify. Sterling takes seven chapters to develop his thesis. The first deals with issues of background, method, and procedure. Finding current classifications of ancient history helpful (e.g., the distinction between Near Eastern and Western types) but inadequate, Sterling adopts a theory of genre that pays equal attention to a work's content, form, and function. He then summarizes his findings: such a model has uncovered apologetic 154</page></plain_text>
