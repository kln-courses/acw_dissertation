<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Family Museum Experience: A Review of the Literature Marcia Brumit Kropf THE LAST DECADE, A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS HAVE begun to examine the experiences family visitor groups have in museums. This focus on families is part of an effort to gain a clearer understanding of these experiences and of the learning that takes place. Researchers have found that learning is not the primary reason families visit museums. Nevertheless, they have consistently observed the teaching and learning behaviors of family members. These behav- iors focus on three sources of information and ideas: the exhibits, the labels and educational materials accompany- ing the exhibits, and other people. This article will exam- ine the relationship of family visitors to each of these sources of information as described by recent research (see Further Reading, p. 4): ■ Deborah P. Benton (1979) studied the interactions of family group members with each other and the exhibits by conducting unobtrusive observations of a minimum of 25 adult-child visitor groups at specific ex- hibit areas at four museums in the New York City area: the American Museum of Natural History, the Bronx Zoo, the Brooklyn Children's Museum, and the Metro- politan Museum of Art. ■ Robert L. Wolf and Barbara L. Tymitz (1979) studied visitors' perceptions by conducting several hundred hours of unobtrusive observations and interviewing 300 visitors at the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C. ■ Sherman B. Rosenfeld (1980) studied family visits in order to develop strategies for enhancing learning at zoos. He interviewed 80 family groups at the San Francisco Zoo, unobtrusively observed and then inter- viewed 25 family groups for the duration of their visits, recorded and transcribed the conversations of 65 groups at specific exhibits, unobtrusively observed questions visitors asked at specific exhibits, and interviewed the eight student docents being questioned. He also de- signed an experimental mini-zoo, unobtrusively ob- Marcia Brumit Kropf is an educator with a background in teaching, teacher training, reading education, and the design of educational materials.

The families gave her permission to observe, so she was able to be close to the group and note subtle behaviors and verbal information. ■ D. D. Hilke and John D. Balling (1985) studied the learning agenda of family visitors, the strategies used to meet it, and the roles of family members in relation to it. They observed, with permission, 42 family groups at a traditional exhibit hall and a participatory exhibit hall at a large museum of natural history in an urban area. ■ Samuel M. Taylor (1986) studied the behavior and interests of visitors to the Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco by observing, with permission, the entire visits of 25 family groups, collecting 418 visitor questions re- garding specific displays, and conducting many unobtru- sive observations and informal interviews. Exhibits Researchers found that observation of exhibits was the most prevalent learning behavior for family visitors. Not surprisingly, this behavior was dramatically affected by the exhibit type, the museum environment, and the family's orientation to the museum. Museum staff can influence family learning behavior when designing exhibits, deter- mining exhibit location, and planning the museum envi- ronment. How Long Did Families Spend at Exhibits? The length of time spent at an exhibit provides some indication of the learning that may take place. For ex- ample, Rosenfeld found that the exhibits where children spent the most time were the exhibits they recalled the best. Typically, however, family visitors were observed walking past exhibits and looking at them without breaking stride. Researchers give this behavior various names: exploratory behavior (Rosenfeld), shopping around (Diamond), and move-on looking (Hilke and Balling). In these studies, family visitors viewed most exhibits for less than 45 sec- onds and only a small number of exhibits for three minutes or more. Visitors spent longer periods viewing exhibits at the beginning of their visit, Taylor observed, and much less time at individual exhibits as the visit progressed and museum fatigue developed. Rosenfeld found that some families returned to an exhibit during the course of the museum visit, and the second visit was significantly longer than the first. What Type of Exhibits Sustained the Interest of Families? In these studies, the type of exhibit appeared to influence the time families spent observing it. Families spent several minutes at exhibits that were participatory, allowed touch- ing, or involved physical activities such as crawling and climbing. They showed less move-on looking behavior at participatory exhibits. When a staff member or docent was available to answer questions informally, the time spent at an exhibit increased to as much as 22 minutes. Researchers consistently found that families spent more time at the exhibits that involved interaction between visitors and the Volume 14, Number 2 Spring-Summer 1989 / 5</page><page sequence="2">exhibit, between visitors and docents, or - in zoos - be- tween animals or between zookeepers and animals. In ad- dition, novel or unusual exhibit content attracted families for longer periods, in spite of a pattern of decreasing viewing times due to museum fatigue. How Does the Museum Environment Influence a Family's Response to an Exhibit? A number of environmental factors influenced the amount of time families spent at an exhibit. Benton found that they spent less time at exhibits with dim lighting and at exhibits that were visually inaccessible for children either because of the exhibit's height or because of the presence of physi- cal barriers. These results led Benton to the conclusion that museums predetermine visitor attention to an exhibit when making decisions about the design, the location, and the lighting. This conclusion is reiterated in Taylor's work, which confirms earlier studies of visitor traffic patterns and the existence of two dominant patterns. He found that right- hand turns were predominant and that, as the visits pro- gressed, visitors spent decreasing times at each display. Taylor concluded that the museum layout did determine visitors' traffic patterns and, therefore, the exhibits they visited. Benton found that the museum environment also influenced both the appropriateness of the children's behavior and the need for adults to restrict that behavior. As a result, the environment also influenced the group's attention to an exhibit. Children tended to walk with the adults in quiet indoor settings where guards were present. They tended to behave more exuberantly in outdoor settings where adults did not restrict their behavior. Activities other than exhibits also attracted fami- lies. Rosenfeld found that families spent about one- third of their time in the zoo watching animals. They spent the rest of the time walking, using the play- ground, eating, and riding on the zoo train. He noted that most families spent more time at the food concessions than at any exhibit. The presence of other museum visitors influenced a family's attention to an exhibit. Families in Benton's study tended to walk past exhibits when other visitors were blocking their view. If an exhibit included a lot of viewing space, the family stopped to view it only when they found an empty space. Taylor found that in a museum layout with a determined traffic pattern, a new family group arriving at an exhibit would "bump" the family on to a new exhibit, limiting their time at the display. In fact, Wolf and Tymitz found that visitors planned their visits to avoid crowds. How Do Other Exhibits Influence a Family's Response to a Specific Exhibit? Some exhibits, because of their size or attractiveness, can distract the family from viewing exhibits nearby. Visitors were attracted to interactive exhibits, for example, while they neglected the noninteractive ones. Wolf and Tymitz found that visitors compared specific exhibits with other exhibits in the zoo and with other zoo trips. Visitors tried to draw associations, transferring information learned at one exhibit to another. This behavior led Wolf and Tymitz to recommend that the museum facilitate the transfer of learning and help the visitor integrate observations. Taylor also made this recommendation, noting that in museums where the layout causes visitors to travel in one direction, museum educators have an opportunity to use sequential displays for more in-depth interpretation. How Does the Length of the Museum Visit Influence a Family's Response to an Exhibit? Rosenfeld found that most families viewed less than half the zoo's exhibits. He also found a direct relationship between the time spent watching animals and the number of exhibits viewed for at least two minutes. Diamond observed that the amount of reading and the amount of describing decreased as the visit progressed. She also found that aggressive behaviors increased during the second quarter of the visit and that interactions with people outside the family group increased during the third quarter of the visit. How Does a Family's Familiarity with the Museum Influence the Response to an Exhibit? Orientation to the museum's floor plan seemed to be a problem for many families in these studies. Taylor found that many groups missed exhibits because, in an effort to avoid backtracking, they tended to leave the aquarium when they came to an exit. What Questions Do Families Have about the Exhibits? Researchers commonly found that visitors were interested in concrete information about what they were seeing. Wolf and Tymitz observed that visitors asked about the animal, the species, and zoo care. Rosenfeld also found that most questions concerned a specific animal. In addition, he discovered that children asked most questions and that these commonly concerned the animal's name and their personal interactions with the animal. Hilke and Balling concluded that the majority of behaviors involving the acquisition and exchange of information dealt with simple facts. And in Taylor's study, the most frequently asked questions concerned concrete, visually verifiable aspects of the fish exhibits. Labels Research shows that family visitors read labels and signage infrequently. They do not use exhibit labels accurately or to their fullest potential, an indication that museum staff could use labels more effectively to influence the informa- tion families share. What Family Members Read the Labels? Benton found that 5 to 10 percent of the adults read the labels and that this group was largely composed of men who read silently, sharing the information only when asked. Rosenfeld also found that reading labels and signs was infrequent, occurring at only 8 percent of the exhibits, and that the immediate sharing of information read was rare. In Hilke and Balling's study, less than 18 percent of the learning strategies recorded involved reading labels and diagrams; most family members focused on acquiring firsthand information from the exhibit. Taylor frequently observed the scanning behavior of the adult men in the family group, who scanned the labels as they walked, 6 / Journal of Museum Education</page><page sequence="3">stopping to look at an exhibit when a name or a picture captured their attention. Do Labels Provide the Information Family Visitors Seek? Taylor found little relationship between the information visitors sought and the information the labels provided. The visitors were interested in concrete information about the aspects of the display that immediately caught their attention, but the labels were often focused on more abstract concepts. Taylor suggested that museums design labels that provide information of immediate relevance to visitors and capitalize on this information to introduce important concepts. People Taylor points out that "in terms of sheer quantity of information, nothing comes close to that exchanged be- tween members of a group of visitors." There is some evidence across these studies, however, that the informa- tion exchanged is inaccurate or misunderstood. This ex- change of misconceptions can undermine the learning that might take place and is of critical concern for museum staff, who can address misconceptions through exhibit design, label design and content, and staff training. How Do Individual Family Members Influence the Family's Response to the Exhibit? Adults tended to pace the visit, select exhibits to view, and determine the time spent at specific exhibits either by calling and sustaining the children's attention to an ex- hibit or by motivating the children to move on. Although children might be allowed to select an exhibit, they rarely led the group away from the exhibit. In small, enclosed settings, however, children did lead the groups. Adults were often required to carry or lift small children to enable them to view an exhibit, fatiguing the parents and contributing to a shorter museum visit. Taylor found that "scouts" (usually young boys) would investigate ex- hibits ahead of the family group, encourage the family to visit the next exhibit, and quickly move on. This behavior seemed to limit the time the whole family spent at exhibits. Children also tended to motivate activities that were not exhibit related, such as eating. Benton found that the leadership style of the family tended to influence the time spent at exhibits. Families in which children had some leadership spent less time with disciplinary issues and more time in exhibit- directed behavior. Those that were led by the adults tended to spend a short time at each exhibit. What Roles Do Individuals Take in the Family? Adults tended to interact more often with children than with other adults, and children tended to interact more often with adults than with other children. Parents took on the role of showing their children what to do in a museum: how to behave, how to use labels, what to look at. In groups that included adult males, the male was the dominant leader. At interactive exhibits, children tended to be the ones who interacted with the exhibits, while the adults watched and read instructions. Rosenfeld found that families came to the zoo with a range of social agendas, such as spending time together, that were as important or more so than viewing the exhib- its. Taylor reiterated the importance of these social factors in influencing the family's experiences in museums. What Do Families Talk about and How? In the Wolf and Tymitz study, the most common form of conversation was descriptions of observed animal behav- ior; the second most common was questions about the animal, species, or zoo care. In Rosenfeld's study, the major conversational themes included naming the animal, point- ing out an animal's behavior or a physical attribute, insti- gating animal behavior, and reflecting on related issues. In Taylor's study, families talked about what they knew from previous experiences, discussing the exhibits in terms of these experiences and memories. As Taylor observed, these discussions provide parents with opportunities to reinforce past experiences and family history and to de- velop a shared understanding among the family members. In fact, Taylor writes that "the use of the aquarium as an environment for reinforcement of previously held knowl- edge or experience is far more frequent than is using the aquarium for the acquisition of new knowledge." The leadership style of the family tended to influence the tìnte spent at exhibits. Families in "which children had some leadership spent less time with disciplinary issues and more time in exhibit-directed behavior. How Do Family Members Provide Information? Wolf and Tymitz found that individuals tended to share their interpretations of what they observed with other members of the group. In their study, these interpreta- tions - which were described in general terms- concerned animal habitat, structural characteristics, and activity. Wolf and Tymitz noted many examples of misconceptions, espe- cially in relation to animal activity where visitor comments were anthropomorphic, assigning human reactions and emotions to animals. Rosenfeld and Taylor also observed that comments and questions were anthropomorphic. Wolf and Tymitz found many examples of direct teach- ing on the part of individuals in the group, including children. When parents took on the role of teacher, there appeared to be two patterns. Mothers with young children tended to teach about animal activity and the discussions were overwhelmingly anthropomorphic. Fathers tended to take on the direct teaching role and to focus on animal characteristics and specific behavior, relying on outside in- formation that was correct and incorrect. Diamond found that teaching was a reciprocal activity, but that "different family members teach in different contexts and for different reasons." Children tended to share information about the operation of the exhibit and the phenomena being observed. Adults tended to share symbolic information gained from reading the labels and from their previous experience. Hilke and Balling also Volume 14, Number 2 Spring-Summer 1989 / 7</page><page sequence="4">found that children and parents shared control of the family's learning processes. Taylor observed visitors reading labels and then sharing the information they acquired. In some cases, visitors shared inaccurate information, both from misinterpreta- tion of the labels and from passing on their own incorrect knowledge. In the case of parents of young children, the la- bels were read aloud, but difficult words were simultane- ously translated to simpler words What Information Do People outside the Croup Provide? Benton found that guards primarily provided directions and guidance as to appropriate behavior, but they did not encourage any interaction with exhibits. She found, how- ever, that staff at the children's museum encouraged inter- action with exhibits. Wolf and Tymitz observed that visitors initiated infor- mal conversations with zoo personnel in order to acquire information about the animals. These conversations were repeated to family members who had not heard the discus- sion, and, following the conversation, children continued to question their parents. Wolf and Tymitz recommended the increased use of well-trained roving guides, especially to address the misinformation visitors share. In the Rosen- feld study, however, families did not listen to the commen- tary by the trained guides on the zoo train, nor did they ask questions. Taylor found that volunteer interpreters fre- quently did not have enough training or knowledge to re- spond to visitor questions and saw their role as policemen rather than explainers. Recent research has provided a clearer picture of the expe- riences family groups have in museums and contributed to our understanding of the informal learning that takes place. Museum educators can use this new understanding to improve learning by family visitors through the design and placement of exhibits, the use of labels, and the training of museum staff. The research described here was conducted, for the most part, in zoos, aquariums, natural history museums, and science museums. The experiences families have in these types of museums may be quite different from the experiences they have in art museums. Further research incorporating a wider range of museums would be of great value to museum educators as they shape their vision of how families learn together and what muse- ums can offer family visitors. 8 / Journal of Museum Education</page></plain_text>
