Children, Scientists, and the Invocation of Hidden Causal Powers Paul L. Harris It is often assumed that scientific thinking displaces magical thinking, both historically and ontogenetically, but the tendency to invoke hidden causal powers straddles both modes of thought. The strength of this disposi- tion among children and adults alike stands in need of explanation. INTRODUCTION At an auction sale in 1936, Keynes, the economist, bought a set of manuscripts written by Isaac Newton. On finding that many of them were devoted to al- chemy, Keynes concluded that-contrary to popular mythology-Newton was not the first representative of the Age of Reason. Rather, he was "the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago" (Keynes, 1951, pp. 363- 364). Recent analysis offers a less schismatic account of Newton's intellectual preoccupations. His passion- ate interest in occult forces was not just an ancient legacy that stood in the way of his scientific moder- nity: There are important continuities between the concepts that Newton found in alchemy and those that he deployed in his cosmology. In particular, to the dismay of some of his scientific contemporaries, he invoked the alchemical notion of hidden and un- known forces of attraction and repulsion between bodies, as against the straightforward mechanistic notion of force via impact (Henry, 1990). Keynes's eloquent but flawed characterization of Newton illustrates the unthinking tendency to con- sider magical thinking as being in historical opposi- tion to, and eventually supplanted by, scientific thinking. More reflective scholarship underlines the ultimate difficulty of drawing any sharp line of de- marcation between the two modes of thought. Wool- ley's review points to a similar conclusion for ontoge- netic development. In this commentary, I consider the theoretical background for contrasting magical with scientific thinking and elaborate on a neglected affinity between them (Harris, 1994). THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK At first glance, Woolley's conclusion that there are no qualitative differences between young children and adults in their susceptibility to magical or fantastical thinking is disconcerting. After all, a prevalent model of ontogenetic development echoes Keynes's concep- tion of the history of science: A disposition toward irrational or magical thinking is gradually displaced by more rational and scientific thinking. The tradi- tional Piagetian account of development implies such a developmental shift. Admittedly, recent research on cognitive develop- ment has undermined Piaget's theoretical stance. Many findings over the last 20-30 years have shown that young children are more rational than Piaget al- lowed. Indeed, one influential group of investigators argues that there is an important sense in which even the young child is a scientist (Carey &amp; Spelke, 1994; Gopnik &amp; Meltzoff, 1997; Wellman, 1990). Still, it is worth noting that this critical stance still incorporates a central-but questionable-assumption of Piaget's, namely, that cognitive development and modern sci- ence are similar because in each context corrigible theories are constructed, tested, found wanting, and revised. My own view is that this canon for cognitive development is misleading. Once its weaknesses are exposed, the important continuities between children and adults reviewed by Woolley fall into place and the agenda for research on cognitive development looks different. The implausibility of the analogy between cogni- tive development and theory testing in science can be highlighted by examining the historical record. Archaeological evidence indicates that our own spe- cies (Homo sapiens sapiens) emerged approximately 100,000 years ago (Mithen, 1996).

Harris 1019 backdrop, science as a systematic, collective enter- prise in which theories are tested and revised is a re- cent and local phenomenon; it appeared only in the last 3 or 4 centuries and only in certain parts of the world. More graphically, if we imagine the history of our species compressed into 24 hours, then modern institutionalized science appears only in selected lo- cations in the last few minutes of the final hour. We find a very different timetable and dispersion for magical or religious thinking. Complex burial pat- terns, including the adornment of the body with beads, bracelets, and belts, date back 28,000 years (White, 1993). It seems likely that these elaborate burials were sustained by a belief in an afterlife. Dat- ing from the same period of the Upper Paleolithic are examples of anthropomorphic art-impossible fu- sions of, for instance, the legs of a human with the head and torso of a bison. More generally, magic and religion, unlike the institutionalized practice of science, are universal features of human culture, whether we look at contemporary hunter-gatherer societies or at the recorded history of ancient civiliza- tions. So, when we regard theory testing as a canon for cognitive development, we use a set of practices that is highly uncharacteristic of our species. By con- trast, magic and religion have much deeper roots and are ubiquitous. On this analysis, magical thinking is not likely to disappear during adulthood, even in a scientific genius of the stature of Newton. Hence, the evidence that Woolley reviews for widespread magi- cal thinking among adults is just what we might expect. On the other hand, her review does include a major surprise. The cultural history of mankind offers every reason to expect that adults will be dis- posed to magical thinking, but offers no solid reason for expecting that mode of thinking to be wide- spread among children. Yet the evidence reviewed by Woolley suggests that young children are natu- rally disposed to engage in magical thinking. In my judgment, that phenomenon stands in need of explanation. I elaborate this point in the next section. THE NATURE OF METAPHYSICAL THINKING From a biological point of view, we might expect minds that construct accurate representations of events and of their causal mechanisms to have an evolutionary advantage. On this view, any disposi- tion to engage in fantasy and pretense, to consider counterfactual alternatives, to entertain impossible outcomes, or invoke occult forces would be maladap- tive, especially in the young, who must interpret and predict a relatively novel environment. Thus, we must either assume that such a biological viewpoint is an inappropriate framework for thinking about cognitive development, or rethink our assumption that veridicality necessarily confers a selective edge. Faced with that dilemma, I think it wiser to take the second option-to consider the possibility that we have been too quick to see the negative or maladap- tive features of magical thinking, and too insistent on the advantages of corrigibility and veridicality. As an example, we may consider in more detail the invocation of occult forces. Many natural phenomena cannot be readily understood by considering only their outer physical structure. Human action offers an obvious example. When we witness a human ac- tion, especially a goal-directed action, we see only a body in motion. However, when we explain that mo- tion, we invoke a set of hidden forces-beliefs and desires that allegedly motivate and guide the action. Note that we need not specify the composition or me- dium of those hidden forces. We can successfully in- terpret human action in terms of psychological forces even if we know nothing of the brain. In several re- spects, therefore, our naive psychology is akin to magical thinking: We make the assumption that the outward structure of events can be explained by in- voking an invisible set of hidden processes that lack any known physical embodiment. This conceptual maneuver was adopted by Newton as described ear- lier; it was adopted by the Azande in their elaborate accounts of witchcraft (Evans-Pritchard, 1937); it is routinely adopted in most religions (Boyer, 1994). Fi- nally, it is widespread among young children, who invoke beliefs and desires to explain not just human action but inanimate movements of rivers and clouds (Berzonsky, 1971), as well as the "actions" of lifeless dolls (Wolf, Rygh, &amp; Altshuler, 1984), and of imag- ined companions (Taylor, Cartwright, &amp; Carlson, 1993) and monsters (Johnson &amp; Harris, 1994). In sum, it is plausible to suppose that magical thinking is part of a wider disposition to invoke a hidden causal structure beneath the surface appear- ance of phenomena. Sometimes it yields what we take to be a veridical, or at least a corrigible, causal account, as in the case of folk psychology; it may also yield what we may judge (from a contemporary per- spective) to be persistent and incorrigible magical be- liefs-as in the case of witchcraft. Woolley's review has done a great service by showing that this disposi- tion is present in adults and children alike. Indeed, a plausible lesson to draw from her review is that in future research we need not concern ourselves too much with the exact proportion of veridical to magi- cal beliefs, nor even with the question of whether that</page><page sequence="3">1020 Child Development proportion changes in the course of development. Re- call that scientific concern for the veridicality and cor- rigibility of such hidden causal structures has been with us for only a few minutes of the last hour of our cultural history. What we do need is a more rigorous analysis of the disposition to invoke such causal structures in the first place. As I have tried to suggest, that disposition straddles the ultimately problematic distinction between magical and scientific thinking.
