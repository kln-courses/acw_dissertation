<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OTHER CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA: COSMIC HIERARCHY AND INTERIORIZED APOCALYPTICISM' BY BOGDAN G. BUCUR ABSTRACT: Clement of Alexandria's Excerpta ex Theodoto, Eclogae Propheticae, and Adumbrationes depict a cosmic hierarchy featuring, in descending order, the divine Face, the seven beings first created, the archangels, and the angels. This account is problematic in that it seems to incorporate a contradiction: one set of texts presents a fix cosmic hierarchy populated by different types having at its top the seven protoctists. A second set of texts, however, interprets this process of initiation as a continuous ascent on the cosmic ladder, marked by an ongo ing cyclical transformation of humans into angels, of angels into archangels, and of archangels into protoctists. This article sets forth the principles governing Clement's hierarchical cos mos, and proposes a solution to the apparent contradiction between the two accounts. In essence, Clement of Alexandria internalizes the cosmic ladder and the associated experience of ascent and transformation, offering an early exam ple of what scholars have termed "interiorized apocalypticism." 1 (*) An earlier version of this study was presented before the Seminar on the Jewish Roots of Eastern Christian Mysticism at Marquette University (www.mu.edu/maqom), in April of 2004. I would like to thank the participants, and especially Fr. Alexander Golitzin, Dr. Andrei Orlov, and Dr. Kevin Sullivan, for their pertinent observations and critique. Many thanks also to Fr.

"The Other Clement" and the Secret Tradition Dwarfed and almost obscured by the "canonical" Clement of Alexandria the Hellenist, the Christian Middle Platonist and Stoic, the heir to Philo, the precursor of Origen there exists, as it were, "another" Clement. The voice of this "other Clement," echoing the theology and practices of the "elders"-Jewish Christian teachers of earlier generations is dominant in the surviving fragments of the Hypotyposes: the Excerpta ex Theodoto, the Eclogae Propheticae, and the Adumbrationes.2 The "other Clement" is one of our most eminent witnesses of secret tra ditions ascribed to the apostles and circulating among Jewish Christian teachers during the first three centuries of the common era.3 According to Jean Danielou, this secret tradition, imparted orally, only to advanced Christians, was "the continuation within Christianity of aJewish esotericism that existed at the time of the Apostles" and concerned in large measure the mysteries of the heavenly worlds; more precisely, amongJewish-Christians, starting as early as the apostles themselves, the concern was to relate the mystery of Christ's death and resurrection to the mysteries of the heavenly world.4 In his own exploration of this topic, Gedaliahu Guy Stroumsa sug 2 On the Hypotyposes and their place in the Clementinian corpus, see Pierre Nautin, "La fin des Stromates et les Hypotyposes de Cl?ment d'Alexandrie," VigChr 30 (1976), 268-302. For a survey of other theories pertaining to the origin and function of the Excerpta and the Eclogae, see 270-282. On the presence of Jewish and Jewish Christian' traditions in these works by Clement, see Jean Dani?lou, 'Les traditions secr?tes des Ap?tres,' ?ranos Jahrbuch 31 (1962), 199-215. Throughout this essay, the term Jewish Christian' will be taken in the sense described by Dani?lou in his classic work The Theology of Jewish Christianity (London: Darton, Longman &amp; Todd, 1964). As long as the narrative of an early and radical parting of the ways between 'Christianity' and Judaism' remains normative, despite its inability to explain a great deal of textual evidence from the first four centuries, the term Jewish Christianity' remains useful as a description of 'Chris tianity' itself. For more recent treatments of this problem, see the essays collected in A.H. Becker, A.Y. Reed (eds.), The Ways that Never Parted (TSAJ 95; T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003); Daniel Boyar?n, Border Lines: The Partition ofJudaeo-Christianity (Philadelphia, Pa.: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004). 3 Clement mentions such Jewish Christian teachers?"the elders"?and their oral teaching with great reverence: Eclogae 11; 27.1; Adumbrationes in 1 Jn 1:1; fragments 8, 14, and 25 (in Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 6.14.5, 6.9.2, 6.13.9). 4 "Le contenu de cette tradition secr?te concerne les secrets du monde c?leste, qui ?tait d?j? dans le juda?sme l'objet d'un savoir r?serv?.

According to Clement, "the gnostic tradition according to the canon of the truth" comprises first an account of the world's coming into being (irep' Koc,URoyovia;), beginning with "the prophetic utterances of Genesis" (aio tij; npO(poyCT00Ci0%... y6V?Ce?5;), followed by an ascent to "the subject-matter of theology" (?x1 tb OeoXoytcKOv el6og).6 This 0?XooytKOV ?60o; is elsewhere (Strom 1.28.176) also described as a matter of visionary contemplation, Fio7C0re_a, and explained in light of Plato and Aristotle.7 Yet el6o; also hap pens to be the term used by the LXX version of Ezekiel 1:26 (6goigROxC 6; el8og &amp;vOp' ou). Moreover, we know thatJews and Christians of the Greek diaspora were fond of drawing a connection between Ezekiel 1:26 and the Platonic theory of forms (e.g., l60o; a&amp;vpdoo in Parm 130 C).8 It appears quite likely, then, that "the subject-matter of theology" that Clement has in l'enseignement commun, mais d'une initiation plus pouss?e, de caract?re oral" (Dani?lou, "Les traditions secr?tes des Ap?tres," ?ranos Jahrbuch 31 (1962), 214. 5 Gedaliahu G.

BUCUR mind concerns both Plato's "vision of truly great mysteries," and Ezekiel's vision of the divine chariot-throne.9 Within this second area of speculative concern "the ascent to the sub ject-matter of theology," to use the phrase in Strom 4:1:3 the following pages will discuss the hierarchical cosmology that Clement inherited from earlier tradition, and the way in which he modified it to suit his own theo logical concerns. 2. Clement of Alexandria's Celestial Hierarchy On the basis of a theological tradition inherited from Jewish Christian "elders," Clement of Alexandria furnishes a detailed description of the hier archical structure of the universe.'0 a. 7he Pranciples of the Hierarchy This celestial "hierarchy" if the anachronism is acceptable features, in descending order, the Face, the seven beings first created, the archangels, finally the angels." Clement's "celestial hierarchy" comprising the Logos, 9 The oudined similarity is, of course, not suggestive of any sort of direct borrowing. "Clement does not reflect living contacts with Jewish scholars" (Annewies van den Hoek, "The 'Catechetical' School of Early Christian Alexandria and Its Philonic Heritage," HTR 90 [1997], 80). However, Jewish traditions of the second Temple are influential in the shaping of both Christianity and Judaism. 10 The fact that Clement's strictly hierarchical universe goes back to earlier tradition has been demonstrated by older research: Paul Collomp, "Une source de Cl?ment d'Alexandrie et les Hom?lies Pseudo?Cl?mentines," Revue de philologie et litt?rature et d'his toire anciennes 37 (1913), 19-46; Wilhelm Bousset, J?disch-christlicher Schulbetrieb in Alexandria und Rom: Literarische Untersuchungen zu Philo und Clemens von Alexandria, Justin und Iren?us (G?ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1915). Despite the pertinent critique of some of Bousset's conclusions (Johannes Munck, Untersuchungen ?ber Klemens von Alexandria [Stutt gart: Kohlhammer, 1933], 127-204), the thesis of a Jewish and Jewish-Christian literary source behind Clement remains solidly established (see Georg Kretschmar, Studien zur fr?hchristlichen Trinit?tstheologie [T?bingen: Mohr, 1956], 68, n. 3). 11 The term "hierarchy" was coined centuries later by the anonymous author of the Pseudo-Areopagitic Corpus. I have taken the liberty to use it for Clement's description of the celestial realm, because the fundamental operating principles of the Clementinian and Dionysian universes are quite similar. This fact has been noted in passing by Alexander Golitzin (Et Introibo Ad Altare Dei: The Mystagogy ofDionysius Areopagita, with Special Reference to its Predecessors in the Eastern Christian Tradition [Analekta Vlatadon 59; Thessalonica: 1994], 265), but has not yet received adequate treatment.</page><page sequence="5">THE OTHER CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 255 the seven protoctists, the archangels, and the angels'2 seems to be continued by an ecclesiastical hierarchy, since Clement affirms that "the advancements (npoKonat) pertaining to the Church here below, namely those of bishops, presbyters and deacons, are imitations (pgi 'wxt) of the angelic glory" (Strom. 6:13:107). The orienting principle (&amp;pxi'j) of the hierarchy is the "Face of God," a theme whose prominence in the apocalyptic literature of Second Temple Judaism was only amplified with the emergence of Christianity.'3 More than "the radiant facade of God's anthropomorphic extent," more than a code-expression for "a vision of the enthroned Glory,"'4 the Face of God is for Clement, as for some later Hekhalot traditions, a hypostatic "Face."'5 For Clement, "the Face of God is the Son" (Excerpta 10:6) an 12 Since God is neither an accident (Gi)u?e?r|KOc), nor described by anything acciden tal (Strom. 5:12:81), he is beyond the hierarchy, and should not be counted as the first of five hierarchical levels (pace Collomp, "Une source," 24, and Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie 20). To designate the Father, Clement repeatedly alludes to the famous Platonic "beyond ousia" (?TCEKEiva xfj? o?G?ac, Rep 509b), which had been already appropriated by Justin (?rc?iceiva 7iaofj? o?aioc?, Dial 4:1). God is one and beyond the one and the monad (Paed. 1:8:71), and beyond cause (x? ?rc?iceiva a?xiov, Strom. 7:2:2). 13 CL. Seow, "Face," in K. van der Toorn, B. Becking, P.W. van der Horst (eds.), Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible (Leiden; Boston: Brill; Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1999), 322-325. According to Andrei Orlov (The Enoch-Metatron Tradition [TSAJ, 107; T?bingen: Mohr-Siebeck; 2005], 153, 279), early Enochic texts, such as 1 Enoch, Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, or the Book of Giants, make little use of "face" imagery; however, in the context of an ongoing polemic against other Jewish traditions of divine mediatorship, later Enochic booklets?2 Enoch, 3 Enoch?produce extensive reflections on the Face. For a theological evaluation of the theme of the Face in the Pseudepigrapha, see Orlov, The Enoch-Metatron Tradition', "Exodus 33 on God's Face: A Lesson From the Enochic Tradition," SBLSP 39 (2000), 130-147; "The Face as the Heavenly Counterpart of the Visionary in the Slavonic Ladder of Jacob," in C.A.

Lewis, eds. The Jewish Roots of Christological Monotheism [JSJ 63; Leiden: Brill, 1999], 327-29. 14 Orlov, The Enoch-Metatron Tradition, 282: "It is evident that all four accounts, Exodus 33:18-23, Psalm 17:15, 1 Enoch 14, and 2 Enoch 39:3-6, represent a single tradition in which the divine Face serves as the terminus technicus for the designation of the Lord's anthropomorphic extent." 15 According to Nathaniel Deutsch (Guardians of the Gate: Angelic Vice Regency In Late Antiquity [Leiden; Boston: Brill, 1999], 43), at least one Merkabah passage (?? 396-397), "explicidy identifies Metatron as the hypostatic face of God," so that "the tide sar ha panim... is better understood as 'prince who is the face [of God].'" See also Orlov, The Enoch-Metatron Tradition, 124-125.</page><page sequence="6">256 BOGDAN G. BUCUR affirmation repeated elsewhere.'6 To describe the continual propagation of light from the Face down to the lowest level of existence, Clement uses the adverb npo?Ye%XC;, suggesting immediacy, the lack of any interval between the levels: each rank of spiritual entities is "moved" by the one above it, and will, in turn, "move" the immediately lower level. The purpose of hierarchy consists in the spiritual progress, or "advancement" (7rpoKo7n) of each of the spiritual levels, or The first level of celestial entities contemplating the Face is constituted by the seven npConoKxtiarol, celestial beings "first created." On the one hand, these protoctists are numbered with the angels and archangels, their subordi nates.'8 On the other hand, they are bearers of the divine Name, and, as such, they are called "gods."'9 Clement equates them with "the seven eyes 16 Excerpta 12:1: "But the Son is the beginning of the vision of the Father [lit.: 'fatherly vision'], called 'the Face (?p?Gomov) of the Father.'" April DeConick ("Heavenly Temple Traditions," 325) states that "the image of the Son as the Father's Face may have played a significant role in Valentinian theologies." However, the repeated occurrence of the same designation in Clement of Alexandria (Paed 1:57 and 1:124:4, Strom 7:58, as well as in Tertullian (Adv. Prax. 14), suggests that "Face" as a Christological title was at least as popular in the "Great Church" (to use Celsus' designation: Origen, Against Celsus 5:59) as it was in Valentinian tradition. 17 According to Fran?ois Sagnard, 7ipoae%co? "indique la continuit? dans l'espace, sans interm?diaire. La dynamis (ou: le logos) du P?re passe continuellement dans le Monog?ne pour l'engendrer. On peut dire aussi que le Monog?ne est cette dynamis du P?re" (Excerpta, 79, n. 2; Emphasis mine); "P u?tEpo^rj est la diff?rence entre deux ?chelons" de la 7cpoK07TT| (Sagnard, Extraits 11, n. 3). Pointing to Strom. 7:2:10, Christian Oeyen explains: "Die verschiedenen Stufen des Fortschrittes heissen . . . la^ei?, das Fortschreiten von einer zur anderen 7CpoK07ir|" (Eine fr?hchristliche Engelpneumatologie bei Klemens von Alexandrien [Bern, 1966], 9). 18 "Hae namque primitivae virtutes ac primo creatae (rendering TtpcoT?yovoi Kai TCpcoT?KTiaxoi ?uvdcu?i?), inmobiles exsistentes secundum substantiam, cum subiectis ange lis et archangelis" (Adumbrationes in 1 Jn 2:1). St?hlin's critical edition introduces a comma between "inmobiles" and "exsistentes." I prefer to revert to Zahn's text, which has no comma. Thus, I take "inmobiles exsistentes secundum substantiam" to mean that their substance is immovable according to substance, i.e., does not undergo change. A num ber of scholars (Zahn, Kretschmar, Barbel) identified these "powers" with two paracletes; on the other hand, the idea that the "powers" under discussion are the seven protoctists is supported by Fran?ois Sagnard, the editor and translator of the Excerpta for Sources Chr?tiennes (Excerpta 11', n. 2), and, more recently, by Henning Ziebritzki (Heiliger Geist und Weltseele: das Problem der dritten Hypostase bei Or?genes, Plotin und ihren Vorl?ufern [T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1994], 122, n. 148). But the most extensive argumentation has been fur nished by Oeyen (Engelpneumatologie, 31-33). 19 "Now, in the Gospel according to Mark, when the Lord was interrogated by the high priest if He was 'the Christ, the Son of the blessed God,' He answered saying, 'I</page><page sequence="7">THE OTHER CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 257 of the Lord" (Zech 3:9, 4:10; Rev 5:6), the "thrones" (Col 1:16), and the "angels ever contemplating the Face of God" (Mat 18:10).20 The protoctists are seven, but they are simultaneously characterized by unity and multi plicity: although distinct in number, Clement writes, "their liturgy is com mon and undivided."21 The protoctists fulfill multiple functions: in relation to Christ, they present the prayers ascending from below (Excerpta 27:2); on the other hand, they function as "high priests" with regard to the archangels, just as the archangels are "high priests" to the angels, and so forth (Excerpta 27:2). In their unceasing contemplation of the Face of God, they represent the model (npoKdvTRuu) of perfected souls (Excerpta 10:6; 11:1). Here we find a definite echo of theJewish andJewish-Christian traditions about the highest angelic company. The group of seven is found in Ezekiel am; and you shall see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power (a dextris virtutis).' But 'powers' indicates the holy angels. Further, when He says 'at the right hand of God,' he means the same ones, on account of the equality and likeness of the angelic and holy powers, which are called by the one name of God (quae uno nominabantur nomine dei)" (Adumbrationes in Juda 5:24). Clement equates here "power" in the Gospel text with "angels"; in an earlier sentence, he had equated "glory" with "angels": "In the presence of His glory: he means before the angels ..." (Adumbrationes in Juda 5:24). 20 Excerpta 10; Eclogae 57:1. For a synthetic presentation of the protoctists, see A.

BUCUR 9:2-3 (seven angelic beings, of which the seventh is more important than the other six), Tob 12:15 (seven "holy angels" who have access before the Glory, where they present the prayers of "the saints"), and 1 Enoch.22 A list of references to "angel/angels of the face" in the Pseudepigrapha is fur nished by Seow, in his article on "Face," referred to above.23 The notion of "first created" is important to the author of Jubilees: the angels of the pres ence are said to be circumcised from their creation on the second day, thus possessing a certain perfection, and functioning as heavenly models and final destination of the people of Israel (Jub 2:2; 15:27). The Prayer of Joseph seems to imply that Israel ranks higher than the seven archangels, as chief captain and first minister before the face of God.24 Among the Christian texts available to Clement, Revelation mentions seven spirits/angels before the divine throne (1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6; 8:2), and the Shepherd of Hermas knows of a group of seven consisting of the six "first cre ated ones" (np&amp;Tot KTt6T0E'V;) who accompany the Son of God as their sev enth (Vis 3:4:1; Sim 5:5:3). Moving on to laterJewish writings, 3 En 10:2-6 mentions that Metatron is exalted above the "eight great princes" who bear the divine Name. Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, composed around 750 CE, but incorporating material going back to the Pseudepigrapha, combines the number seven and the notion of "first created."25 It is quite clear that Clement's references to protoctists reflect ancient angelological speculations characteristic of Second Temple Judaism. How ever, it should be noted that Clement subjects this material to the spiritual izing interpretation and the Logos-theology inherited from Philo. The 22 1 En 20 (The Book of the Watchers) features seven archangels, echoed by "the seven first snow-white ones" in 1 En 90:21 (Dream Visions); 1 En 40:9 (Similitudes) counts only four archangels. 23 Jub 2:2, 18; 15:27; 31:14; T.

Smith in OTP 2:704, where Christ and the seven protoctists in the Excerpta are offered as a parallel! 25 God "has a scepter of fire in his hand, and a veil spread before him, and his eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth, and the seven angels which were created first minister before him within the veil, and this (veil) is called Pargod" (Pirk? de Rabbi Eliezer [The Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer the Great] According to the Text of the Manuscript Belonging to Abraham Epstein of Vienna [tr.

According to Lilla, "Clement found already formed in Philo the doctrine of the Logos as the totality of powers which are identical with the ideas" (Salvatore Lilla, Clement, 204. Eric Osborn [The Philosophy of Clement 41] affirms that Clement "explained the existence and nature of things by 'pow ers' just as Plato had done by 'forms' and the earlier Stoics had done by immanent rea son or divine fire"). However, the simple equation of the "powers" with the Platonic ideas does not account for the complexity of the text. I submit that he is here attempting to fuse the Logos-speculation with an earlier and established teaching on the "powers of the spirit," a teaching originating not in the philosophical tradition, but in Jewish or Jewish Christian speculation about angelic "powers." It is significant in this respect that Clement immediately quotes the Book of Revelation: "the Word is called the Alpha and the Omega. . . ." (Rev 1:8; also 21:6; 22:13). What he has in mind is surely the throne-visions of Revelation, depicting Christ and the seven spirits or angels in attendance before the throne (Rev. 1:4; 8:2). 27 As Collomp ("Une source," 34; 39) has already demonstrated, here Clement seems to be reworking a source either identical or similar to what has been preserved in the Ps.-Clementine Homilies (17:7), featuring much cruder descriptions. 28 Excerpta 10:1: 'AM/ o??? x? 7tv?U|LiaxiK?

The Function of the Hierarchy The advancement on the cosmic ladder leads to the progressive transfor mation of one level into the next, an idea for which Clement offers a highly complex account.32 According to Clement's Eclogae Propheticae, the believers are being instructed by the angels; their horizon is one of angelification. At the end of a millennial cycle, they are translated into the rank of angels, while their instructors become archangels, replacing their own instructors who are also promoted to a higher level. All degrees of the hierarchy move one step higher every one thousand years; humans become angels, and will function as the angelic guides and teachers of humans: For those among humans who start being transformed into angels are instructed by the angels for a thousand years, in order to be restored to per fection. Then the instructors are translated into archangelic authority, while those who have received instruction will in turn instruct those among humans who are transformed into angels; thereupon they are, at the specified period, reestablished into the proper angelic state of the body (Eclogae 57:5). This periodic "upgrading" also applies to the top level of the hierarchy. Even the protoctists, "the first-created, at the highest level of restoration" (Eclogae 57:1) are "set" higher, so that they may no longer exercise a definite ministry, according to provi dence, but may abide in rest and solely in the contemplation of God alone. But those closest to them will advance to the degree that they themselves have left; and the same occurs by analogy with those on an inferior level (Eclogae 56:5). among spiritual beings"; the protoctists have form and shape "in proportion to the level of the beings below them."

The Problem As Christian Oeyen has rightly noted, in his fundamental study dedicated to Clement's Engelpneumatologie, this raises numerous problems.33 Have the protoctists been created perfect and immutable (Excerpta 10:3; 11:4), or have they acquired perfection? (Eclogae 57)? How can the protoctists be a group of no more and no less than seven, given that no limitation on the number of those "promoted" in their stead has been mentioned? If the protoctists are "the highest level of disposition" (Eclogae 57:1), to what "higher" level can they be translated?34 4. Towards a Solution: "Interiorized Apocalypticism" To answer the questions just raised, it is necessary to determine in how far the Alexandrian master is in agreement with the Jewish and Jewish Christian traditions that he is drawing on. It is well-known that Clement shares Philo's interest in "noetic exegesis."35 I submit that the result of such exegesis is the internalization of the cosmic ladder and of the associated experience of ascent and transformation. a. Clement on the Interior Ascent In Strom 4:25:158, Clement discusses the necessity of the seven-day purification required for the priest who has touched a corpse (Ezekiel 44:26). Since the entire text is a prophetic vision about the eschatological temple and its ministers, Clement can easily allude to an interpretation of the seven days of purification and subsequent entry into the temple as a purification 33 Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie, 12. 34 It should be mentioned that the vast majority of scholars are in agreement that all of these passages belong to Clement. Salvatore Lilla (Clement of Alexandria: A Study in Christian Platonism and Gnosticism [Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1971], 176-183) instead, attributes them to a Gnostic source (179: "perhaps to Theodotus himself"), argu ing that the type of Himmelsreise present in these passages "plunges directiy into Gnosticism" (181, cf. 183). The underlying understanding of "Gnosticism" has in the meantime become untenable. But even if one were to concede the Gnostic character of Excerpta 10-15 and 27, the problem remains no less acute, because Eclogae 57 would then also be labeled as "Gnostic" (see Lilla, Clement, 185; 179, n. 6). In short, whether Clementinian, "Jewish-Christian," or Gnostic, these passages incorporate a contradiction. 35 Osborn, "Philo and Clement: Quiet Conversion and Noetic Exegesis," in The Studia Philonica Annual 10 (1998), 108-124.</page><page sequence="12">262 BOGDAN G. BUCUR from moral corruption,36 followed by the ascent through the seven heavens.37 However, Clement moves beyond the traditional seven-storied cosmology: Whether, then, the time be that which through the seven periods enumerated returns to the chiefest rest, or the seven heavens, which some reckon one above the other; or whether also the fixed sphere which borders on the intellectual world be called the eighth, the expression denotes that the Gnostic ought to rise out of the sphere of creation and of sin.38 It seems that all imagistic details, such as specific intervals of space or time are emptied of the literal meaning they had had in the apocalyptic cosmo logy inherited from the "elders." Whether "seven days," or "one thousand years," or "seven heavens," or "archangels," or "protoctists," the details of the cosmic-ladder imagery become images of interior transformation. This is why the inconsistencies in Clement's account about the protoctists are only apparent. At times, Clement refers to the data he has received from tradi tion. Thus, in the Stromata, he shows himself familiar with the idea that "the whole world of creatures ... revolves in sevens" and that "the first-born princes of the angels (npot6Oyovot &amp;1'CyXov i`pxovtr;), who have the greatest power, are seven";39 and in the Excerpta he presents a detailed description of the entire hierarchy. At other times, however, Clement suggests that these data ought to be further interpreted. For instance, he speaks of ... gnostic souls that surpass in the greatness of contemplation the mode of life of each of the holy ranks (tjn IsyaXoipeztei t Is OCpix; ep oiaa; eKa, ll; &amp;yia , tcEo) Tiv WoXTEiav) ... ever moving to higher and yet higher places Pitt. "reaching places better than the better places," a&amp;gcivoli; agEwvvow 0ronov t6onou;], embracing the divine vision (O&amp;opfrov) not in mirrors or by means of mirrors. This is the vision attainable by "the pure in heart"; this is the function (?v?pysta) of the Gnostic, who has been perfected, to have con vene with God through the great High Priest ... The Gnostic even forms and 36 Clement explicitly rejects anti-somatic ideas: "not that the body was polluted, but that sin and disobedience were incarnate, and embodied, and dead, and therefore abominable." 37 For the origin of the seven-heaven cosmology in Second Temple Judaism and Christianity, see Ioan-Petru Culianu, Psychanodia: A Survey of the Evidence Concerning the Ascension of the Soul and its Relevance (Leiden: Brill, 1983), and Adela Yarbro-Collins, "The Seven Heavens in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses," in JJ.

"This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the Face of the God ofJacob" (Ps. 24:3-6). The prophet has, in my opinion, concisely indi cated the Gnostic. David, as appears, has cursorily demonstrated the Savior to be God, by calling Him "the Face of the God of Jacob" . . .42 In these passages, the "Gnostic soul" is described as possessing unmediated, perfect access to the vision of the Face, taking its stand in His immediate proximity, catC Tor itpo%EX5; (cf. the repeated use of npo6%X&amp;; in the Excerpta to express the immediacy, the lack of any interval between the levels of the hierarchy!). The true Gnostic has been brought "in the presence of His glory: he means before the angels, faultless in joyousness, having become angels."43 The Gnostic "has pitched his tent in El, that is, in God."44 Clement arrives at this conclusion after a creative exegesis of Ps 18:2 ("he pitched his tent in the sun"), by moving from ?V TX i1iXis to ?v TX iX, on the basis of similar ity of sound,45 and from ?V T X to ix t4 0e on the basis of Mark 15:34 ("Eli, Eli, that is, my God, my God").46 Moreover, when Clement says that "the function (ixVipyeua) of the Gnostic who has been perfected" is such that "he even forms and creates himself (vac ,i1v E'uwotv Krti~E Kcat 8qIoupyei" (Strom 7:3:13), the verbs (Kiccti and anotoVpyc?) are a transparent allusion to Gen 40 Strom 7:3:13, ANF slightly modified. 41 Strom 7:10:56-57. 42 Strom 7:10:58. 43 Adumbrationes in Juda 5:24. 44 Eclogae 57.3. 45 It appears that "aspiration had ceased in Athens already before the end of the clas sical period.

According to the rhetorician Tryphon, living in the first century BCE, aspiration was "a rule of the ancients, which the moderns set aside" (Caragounis, Development 391, n. 166). 46 Eclogae 57:3: Kai ut| xi x? ??v xco r\km eOexo x? aicf|v?u?; a?xo?? ouxco? ?^aKo?exai ?v xco f|X?co ?Gexo, xoux?oxw ?v xco r\k fjyouv 0ecp, co? ?v xco e?ayye^icp ?f|?,i T|A,l? ?vxi xo? ?6e? uou, 0e? uou?.

BUCUR 1:26, and signal the transfer of divine functions to the Gnostic.47 One could well say that the Gnostics actually become protoctists, since Clement states that "they are called by the appellation of 'gods,' being destined to sit on thrones with the other gods that have been first put in their places by the Savior."48 There can be no doubt that Clement preserves something that will be eliminated in mainstream Christian theology, but retained by certain strands ofJudaism: the real, ontological "angelification." In 2 Enoch, the patriarch is not merely a visitor to the heavenly realms, but "a servant permanently installed in the office of the sar happanim."49 Similarly, Test Levi 4:2 is explicit about the possibility of becoming a "prince of the presence." Hekhalot lore speaks about becoming superior, more glorious than the "eight great princes" (3 Enoch 10:2-6), becoming "little YHWH" (3 Enoch 12).50 In Christian tradition, however, despite extensive talk about the ascetical holy man living as an "angel in the body," and despite the depiction of an angelic life in heaven, the transformed human being appears "angelomor phic," rather than ontologically "angelic."51 The "real angelification" of the earlier tradition, echoed by Clement, was eventually discarded. The cause had probably something to do with the concern for the Incarnation as a "confirmation" of human existence, and with an awareness of the difficulties that Clement's worldview raises for eschatology.52 47 Alain Le Boulluec, the editor and translator of Strom 1 for the Sources Chr?tiennes series, draws attention to the verbs (Clement d'Alexandrie, Stromate VII; [SC 428 Paris: Cerf, 1997] 70, footnote 2). 48 Strom 7:10:56-57. 49 Orlov, The Enoch-Metatron Tradition, 156. 50 According to Deutsch (Guardians of the Gate, 32-34), "Metatron's. . . transformation from a human being into an angel reflects an ontological process which may be repeated by mystics. ..." 51 I am using the term "angelomorphic" according to the following definition: "Though it has been used in different ways by various scholars, without clear definition, we propose its use wherever there are signs that an individual or community possesses specifically angelic characteristics or status, though for whom identity cannot be reduced to that of an angel" (Crispin H.T. Fletcher-Louis, Luke-Acts: Angels, Christology and Soteriology (WUNT 94; T?bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1997), 14-15. 52 In his concise but very dense treatment of Clement's eschatology, Brian Daley notes that Clement's dynamic conception of "a painstaking development rather than . . . escha tological crisis" is consonant with his view of the punishments after death as "a medici nal and therefore temporary measure" (The Hope of the Early Church: A Handbook of Patristic Eschatology [reprint; Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 2003], 46).</page><page sequence="15">THE OTHER CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 265 I conclude that Clement interprets the tradition about millennial cycles and the ascent on the cosmic ladder as descriptions of an interior phenom enon. He also happens to have been the one to supply the convenient short hand for this interiorized ascent to heaven and transformation before the divine Face: Noxyt;, "deification." b. The Relevance of the Church Hierarchy Confirmation of this view can be found in Clement's affirmations about the church hierarchy. I have noted earlier his conviction that "the advance ments (mpoKonari) pertaining to the Church here below, namely those of bishops, presbyters and deacons, are imitations (,ugi 'gata) of the angelic glory."53 This would yield a model of "church hierarchy," composed of bish ops, priests, and deacons, quite similar to that advocated by Ignatius of Antioch. However, Clement undermines this edifice, by offering the following exegesis: Such a one is in reality a presbyter of the Church, and a true minister (dea con) of the will of God, if he do and teach what is the Lord's; not as being ordained by men, nor regarded righteous because a presbyter, but enrolled in the presbyterate because righteous. And although here upon earth he be not honored with the chief seat, he will sit down on the four-and-twenty thrones, judging the people, as John says in the Apocalypse.54 Quite clearly, Clement takes "bishop," "priest," or "deacon" not as desig nations of ecclesiastical office-holders he appears, in fact, quite unhappy with those "ordained by men" and "honored with the chief seat" , but rather as functional designations of the stages of spiritual advancement.55 For Clement (and, later, for Origen), the function trumps the degree; or, to be more accurate, the inner quality creates the function, which is then reflected in the degree.56 53 Strom 6:13:107. Cf. Strom 7:1:3: the presbyters and deacons are "images" of the (angelic) models of superordinate and subordinate activities (mx? xt]v eKK^naiav xfjv uiv ?e^xicoxiKTiv oi rcpec?uxepoi ocp?ouaiv e?K?va, xf|v ?7ir|pexiKf|v ?? oi ?kxkovoi). 54 Strom 6:13:106, ANF. 55 Evidently, Clement's assertions about Church hierarchy imply their real existence of ecclesiastical office holders in Alexandria (Jakab, Ecclesia Alexandrina, 183). 56 This point is argued emphatically and supported by quotations from Origen and Cyprian of Carthage, by Roncaglia, Histoire de l'?glise copte (Beirut: Dar al-Kalima, 1971), 3:187-189, 192-194. Jakab (Ecclesia Alexandrina, 183) offers the same interpretation.</page><page sequence="16">266 BOGDAN G. BUCUR The "promotion" from one level of the hierarchy to the next reflects the one's spiritual progress: ... those who, following the footsteps of the apostles, have lived in perfection of righteousness according to the Gospel ... [are] taken up in the clouds, the apostle writes, will first minister [as deacons], then be classed in the presbyter ate, by promotion in glory (for glory differs from glory) till they grow into "a perfect man."57 If the affirmation that the church hierarchy is an imitation of the celestial hierarchy is given full weight, it would seem logical for Clement to posit the same sort of "promotion" and transformation on the cosmic ladder-from "angels" to "archangels" to "protoctists" as dependent solely upon the deg ree of spiritual progress. Obviously, the number twenty-four in the case of the elders from Revelation is not taken any more literally than the number seven in the case of the protoctists. Conclusions The "celestial hierarchy" echoed by Clement, goes back not only to Pantaenus, but to an older generation ofJewish-Christian "elders."58 Clement's hierarchy has, on this point, great affinities with that of Dionysius. However, in order to uphold the perfect mirroring between the celestial and the ecclesiastical hier archies in spite of a disappointing historical reality, they adopt divergent strategies: while Clement approaches the issue from the perspective of "function" and thus challenges the authenticity of any "degree" that does not fully mirror the "function," Dionysius writes from the perspective of "degree" and is forced to paint a "supremely idealistic?to say the least?portrait of the Christian clergy . . ." (Golitzin, Et Introibo, 134). For the ongo ing tension between hierarchy and personal holiness in ascetic literature (reaching back to Origen), see Golitzin, "Hierarchy Versus Anarchy? Dionysius Areopagita, Symeon the New Theologian, Nicetas Stethatos, and Their Common Roots in Ascetical Tradition," SVTQ,38 (1994), 131-179. 57 Strom 6:13:107, ANF. 58 On the place of Pantaenus in the development of Alexandrian catechetical tradition, see Martiniano Pellegrino Roncaglia, "Pant?ne et le didascal?e d'Alexandrie: du Jud?o Christianisme au Christianisme Hell?nistique," in Robert Fisher (ed.), A Tribute to Arthur V??bus: Studies in Early Christian Literature and Its Environment, Primarily in the Christian East (Chicago: The Lutheran School of Theology, 1977), 211-223. Other scholars judge the evidence about Pantaenus insufficient for an assessment of his theology: Attila Jakab, Ecclesia Alexandrina: Evolution sociale et institutionelle du christianisme alexandrin (IIe et IIP si?cles) (Bern/Berlin/Bruxelles/Frankfurt a. M./New York/Oxford/Vienna: Peter Lang, 2004), 111, 115.</page><page sequence="17">THE OTHER CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 267 A fitting formula to describe Clement of Alexandria's treatment of the inherited apocalyptic cosmology of the elders would be "interiorized apoc alyptic." This term-which, in keeping with the established definitions,59 I would change to "interiorized apocalypticism" has been proposed for the use of apocalyptic motifs in Byzantine monastic literature, and its definition seems perfectly applicable to Clement: "the transposition of the cosmic set ting of apocalyptic literature, and in particular of the 'out of body' experi ence of heavenly ascent and transformation, to the inner theater of the soul."60 Golitzin has furnished proof of this transposition as early as the fourth and early fifth century Eastern monastic literature; Stroumsa, on the other hand, argues that the shift was completed, at least in the Christian West, with Augustine of Hippo.6' I believe that we may safely affirm that Clement of Alexandria offers one of the earliest examples of "interiorized apocalypticism." The archaic theory of the elders, postulating the celestial hierarchy as the locus of a real transformation from archangels into protoctists, from angels into archangels, and from humans into angels, may prove illumining for our understanding of Clement's statements about the perfected human as "liv ing as an angel on earth, but already luminous, and resplendent like the sun," igayyEo; ,U?v ?vrnaia pweT1VO6; &amp;6 i Kaj 60; o b ijXto; XiRnOv (Strom 7:10:57). Clearly, such views are not unrelated to the later notion of the ascetical bios angelikos. However, if the Jewish-Christian worldview echoed by Clement constitutes the original framework of the "angelification," provid ing it with a very specific meaning, it would be interesting to see to what degree later ascetical literature retained these cosmological associations. 59 Credit goes to John J. Collins (The Apocalyptic Imagination: An Introduction to the Jewish Matrix of Christianity [New York: Crossroad, 1984], 2-11) for the distinction between "apocalypticism" as a worldview and "apocalypse" as a literary form. Apocalypticism is "a worldview in which supernatural revelation, the heavenly world and eschatological judgment play an essential role" (10). 60 Golitzin, "Earthly Angels and Heavenly Men: the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Nicetas Stethatos, and the Tradition of Interiorized Apocalyptic in Eastern Christian Ascetical and Mystical Literature," Dumbarton Oaks Papers 55 (2001), 125-153. 61 "For him [Augustine], the real secrets are no longer those of God, but those of the individual, hidden in the depth of his or her heart, or soul. With him, we witness more clearly than elsewhere, perhaps, the link between the end of esotericism and the devel opment of a new interiorization. This process of interiorization is ipso facto a process of demotization: there remains no place for esoteric doctrine in such an approach" (Stroumsa, Hidden Wisdom, 1).</page><page sequence="18">268 BOGDAN G. BUCUR The texts discussed in these pages are paradigmatic for the widespread hierarchical cosmology in the early centuries of the common era, as well as for the type of difficulties faced by the emerging Christian theology. The most acute problem was the necessity of adapting the hierarchical frame work to a theology of the Trinity; more precisely, the difficulty of "fitting" the Holy Spirit in the hierarchy. In relation to Clement of Alexandria, this topic has been dealt with masterfully and in great detail by Christian Oeyen, in his Engelpneumatologie. A larger presentation would have to take into account the conjunction of hierarchy, prophecy, and the angelic spirit, characteristic not only of "the other Clement," but also of other early Christian authors. I leave the demonstration of this thesis for a later and much larger undertaking. Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI 53233 U.S.A.</page></plain_text>
