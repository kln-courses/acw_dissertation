<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dataism Tom DeWitt Dizzyingly rapid changes in the fine arts during the past century have induced a measure of exhilara- tion. When Dadaists promulgated a Manifesto, their critical attack on the mystique of illusionist art was bracing and re- freshing [1]. Defiance of tradition was liberation, and the arts again brimmed with raw creative energy. Much as a log fire can be stoked to burn with renewed vigor until its last fuel is exhausted, each emerging art movement was ex- coriated long before it could impose its nascent discipline on an entire generation of artists. The twentieth century has given us little to build upon other than an institutionalized iconoclasm. Now this process has run its course. Today the dead embers of modern art may be feverishly stirred by con- temporary cognoscenti, but there is no new light. Those who have championed Schnabel are fully worthy of the double entendre implied by his assemblages of cracked pots [2]. What has happened? The twentieth century obsession with novelty for its own sake is reviewed in Robert Hughes' study of Modern art, The Shock of the New [3]. Contemporary artists fly in the face of established aesthetics, reasonable expectations, conventional wisdom, or other constraints forced upon them by social norms and art history. Theirs is an Age of Outrage; they have a compulsion to offend. Hughes pronounces Modernism moribund. This sentiment is seconded by critic Suzi Gablik, whose treatise, Has Mod- ernism Failed?, raises the specter of a self-perpetuating art market in which aesthetic base metal is transformed into gal- lery gold through an arcane curatorial alchemy [4]. Central to the alchemical formula of successful art mar- keting is the purveyance of unique collectible objects. Origi- nal objets d'art are distinguished from copies by a broad divide. The premier scandal of the collector's world is to be defrauded by a copy. Since the singularity of an object be- comes a measure of its worth, the emergence of repro- ducible media such as lithography and photography creates a dilemma. This dramatic shift from painting, a technology little advanced since the Stone Age, seems to intimidate even the unflappable Robert Hughes: Because nothing could be retrieved or reproduced... the pre- technological eye was obliged to scrutinize-one thing at a time. Objects and images could not, except at the cost of great labor, be reproduced or multiplied.... Today, the object splits into a swarm of images of itself, clones, copies. Mass produc- tion strips every image of its singularity [5]. One solution to the marketability of reproducible media, actually practiced in lithography, has been the deliberate destruction by the artist of a master template after it has pro- duced a finite number of copies. While this approach might satisfy the craven dictates of the marketplace for objets d'art, the consequences are regressive to the culture as a whole. The evolution of literature from handwritten manuscripts Tom DeWitt (artist), Ancramdale, NY, 12503-0083, U.S.A. ? 1989 SAST Pergamon Press plc. Printed in Japan. 0024-094X/89 $3.00+0.00 to printing press reproductions illustrates my point. Hughes' protests notwithstanding, the availability of books sharpened appreciation for the written word, even among collectors. To have limited the number of copies for the sake of enhanc- ing the market worth of each copy would have ill-served our civilization, to say nothing of how it would have limited the circulation of John Hughes' thesis. The issue of duplicable vis- ual art media will not go away. With the advent of computers, the problem has resurfaced. Digital copies are identical to their masters. Scratching an original plate does not work here. Since each digital copy is itself a perfect master, the art- work is the data that describes ABSTRACT Dataism is a term coined to designate computer art. In contrast to the iconoclasm of Modernism, in general, and Dadaism, in particular, Dataism restates traditional aes- thetics through formal practices. Dataist works are not singular objets d'art, but algorithmic proce- dures and digital data bases that have a symbolic description. They can be perfectly duplicated and widely distributed. Dataist artworks can appear to exist in three di- mensions and move in the time dimension, but they may be entirely synthesized, that is, a manifesta- tion of imagination. it. For the purpose of this inquiry, I will call computer art Dataism and its proponents Dataists. A contrary allusion to Dada is deliberate. FOUNDATIONS Our cultural heritage has been transmitted to us, and the arts have played a key role in the transmission. A dynamic culture such as ours has accommodated change. Construc- tive or destructive, the changes are premised on a knowl- edge of precedent, for it is knowledge that is evolving. A broad foundation of precedent offers many choices for artists seeking expression, because they enjoy a broad set of aesthetic premises. How do visual artists formalize an aesthetic so it can be transmitted? Obviously the works of art themselves embody aesthetic intent, but is there a detailed formalism express- ing the process of creation? Certainly art historians have been able to identify cultural periods that produced works sharing a common aesthetic. However, these analyses have proceeded without the benefit of a specialized language that was invoked by the artists during the creative act. A clear contrast exists with Western music. It has compositional formalism complete with a notational system. The role of notation in the development of Western music has been significant. Without the compositional score, the evolution of now-familiar harmonies and orches- trations would have been stunted. The notational system re- flects an aesthetic, a system of discrete sound frequencies LEONARDO, ComputerArt in Context Supplemental Issue. pp. 57-61, 1989 57</page><page sequence="2">and temporal progressions. From this foundation rose musical creations that rank among our culture's greatest in- tellectual achievements. The transmis- sion of these works from their com- posers to our ears depends largely on the acceptance of a formal abstract language and its notation. There is some precedent for ab- stract formalism in the visual arts, par- ticularly in architecture. The rigorous mathematical discipline of geometry gave artists and artisans notational and computational tools for designing buildings and decorations. During the Renaissance the formalism of perspec- tive drawing was introduced, and this procedure has been employed by many subsequent generations of visual artists. But for the large part, image- making has been an intuitive pursuit, carried out by talented individuals whose inspirations are manifest in their work but whose methods are sub- jects of conjecture. Dataism brings with it an innate formalism, because computers are ma- chines programmed using procedural languages. In order to create images on a computer, the artist must invoke specific processes that are expressed in a defined notation. Images that are themselves very large data bases may be created from compact and manage- able algorithms that automatically cal- culate complex images point by point. Even so-called 'paint' programs, which mimic the tactile application of color on canvas, are precise, detailed programs. Computer art calls upon the mathematics of geometry, includ- ing perspective rendering, linking Dataism with the extant foundation of visual formalism. Future develop- ments promise to be much broader than any precedent, because mathe- matics has broadened enormously since it last played a role in the arts. Mathematics is not a visual art. The void that separates the creative artist from the creative mathematician rarely has been bridged, the Renais- sance being a period of notable excep- tions. Yet recently, collaborations have spontaneously formed around the computer screen. In the sciences, the flood of data pouring from engines of calculation has been dammed up be- hind the CRT, triggering a need for visual thinkers. Artists stand at the ready, for they have already been drawn, moth-like, to the flickering light. These Dataists will now build a foundation for aesthetic structures. Their work will enjoy an integrity that is possible only when a common lan- guage is used to communicate the pro- cesses of creation from generation to generation. PRACTICES When photography was invented, the status of representational painting began to wane. The camera produced realistic images with such facility that, by the turn of this century, the talent of a draughtsperson could be eclipsed by any rank amateur toying with his Kodak box camera. Photography, a tri- umph of technology, precipitated a diversion in the fine art mainstream away from illusionism. Photography may have diverted some artists from traditional practices to forms of expression beyond the reach of technology, but many artists embraced the emerging image- making technologies. These artists then had the challenge of bringing the traditions of art to technology. Photo- graphs intrinsically possess much of the realism found in representational painting, but there is a catch. Com- monplace reality is not necessarily as beautiful as the ideal imagery depicted in the great classics. In fact, photogra- phy may have proven better at captur- ing the banal, the pathetic, the comic, and the ugly than ideal beauty. Ideals exist only in the mind. The photo- graph documents reality, not fantasy. To reach the ideal, an attempt was made to place fantasies in front of the camera. This invoked the appearance of other arts as the subject for the pho- tographer, particularly theater with its retinue of writers, players, directors, set designers, costumers, cosmetici- ans, puppeteers, et al. When motion pictures were invented, so was the 'fan- tasy factory' of the film industry. The camera operator became primarily a technician serving at the pleasure of other creative artists who precon- ceived the work and took primary credit for its success. Limitations aside, moving pictures altered a basic assumption about vis- ual art-that images were static. The manipulation of time gave the film- maker an awesome new power of ex- pression. The camera operator could dynamically change the window of view with a mere twist of the camera. Armed with no more than a pair of scissors and a pot of glue, the editor could alter time and place. As in music and theatre, deep emotions could be evoked by artificially changing images. This artifice was an art. It was visual art. It was new art. However, it remained dependent upon what was placed in front of the camera for initial re- cording. The ultimate cinematographic technique for the manipulation of time is animation. For fine artists dedi- cated to bringing aesthetics to tech- nology, stop action photography provided a path to outwit the uncom- promising realism of photography. Since the audience could not see what was going on while the camera was not looking, media magicians were able to practice the sleight of eye, the trompe d'oeil, that makes imagination mani- fest. Painters and draughtspersons were attracted to animation, but the price exacted in toil and treasure tended to compromise artistic integrity. An in- dividual practicing creativity in the tra- dition of the solitary artist was faced with the Herculean task of feeding a medium that consumes up to 24 im- ages a second. Pioneers such as Oskar Fischinger and Len Lye made heroic efforts, but both artists ultimately re- turned to the creation of objects: paintings and sculptures [6]. When the resources of the indus- trial fantasy factories were summoned to provide armies of draughtspeople, creative inspirations were diluted to conform to the economies of the mass audience. Fischinger tragically en- countered this dilemma during the production of Fantasia [7]. Moreover, industrial factories were not capable of producing images of classic beauty. The term 'cartoon' came to imply a re- duced standard of finesse in visual art. Characters were reduced to carica- ture, and stylization was often the forced by-product of an economy of means. I do not wish to dismiss the sincere efforts of creative artists working in the media of photography and filmmak- ing but rather to identify a critical weakness in practice. There is a litmus test to assay the practical limits of a me- dium; namely, does it make the imagina- tion manifest? In photography and film, so much depends on reality, i.e. the objects being recorded, that there is an unavoidable verisimilitude in style among all works in these media. Ani- mation offers the potential for greater variety in visual style, but primarily through the intervention of the classi- cal plastic arts: drawing, painting and 58 DeWitt, Dataism</page><page sequence="3">sculpture. Painting and sculpture are versatile art media, accommodating virtually any visual preconception. Artists of every stripe have expressed their divergent visions through these ancient art forms. Can photographs and films accommodate such di- versity? Consider this archaeological para- digm. To decorate their caves, Cro- Magnon artists used silhouettes de- posited by objects held against a surface and sprayed with smoke or pig- ment. This process created perma- nent negative shadows, suggestive of photographic contact printing [8]. The creative horizons of such an art are limited. Although contact printing allows anyone to make some kind of image, it prohibits the making of most images. The medium that survived these Paleolithic times was another contemporaneous invention: paint- ing. Over 10,000 years of practice have shown that, with painting, imagina- tion alone is the primary limit of expression. The visual similitude among films, at least in comparison with the varied styles found in painting, may partially explain the slow acceptance of cinema as fine art. Television seemingly would have fared no better, since it was orig- inally conceived of as instant cinema. However, the translation of camera- recorded images into an intermediate representation as electronic signals presented artists with some, perhaps unanticipated, possibilities: proces- sing and synthesis. Most video effects are not far re- moved from process photography and have ample precedent. Superimposi- tion, split screen, matting, blue screen recording, contrast enhancement, edge enhancement, and pseudo- colorization have photographic equiv- alents. However, video processing per- mitted the instantaneous production of these 'special' effects, restoring some of the creative spontaneity of painting that film had removed. Pho- tographers work in the dark, both lit- erally and figuratively, due to the delay between exposure and processing. Video synthesis, the creation of im- ages without cameras, has virtually no precedent in photography and film- making. An electronic signal is gen- erated to fit the technical specifica- tions of a camera signal, but the point of origin is within the electronic cir- cuits themselves. Synthesis demands formalism both in the design of cir- cuits and the resultant imagery. Typi- cally, synthesizers produce two-dimen- sional geometric shapes, reminiscent of traditional decorative arts. Video synthesis opened a new realm of expression-visual music. The vis- ual vocabulary in video synthesis is relatively small, if carefully selected. Synthesizers are the kind of special- ized, well-defined instruments that lend themselves well to communica- tions protocols. Both traditional music and contemporary electronic music offer instruction on appropriate prac- tices to formalize the new art. How- ever, video synthesizers cannot begin to encompass the entire realm of vis- ual imagination. The promise of visual music is that within its defined vocabu- lary of expression will be found an aes- thetic of the same universality that makes aural music so emotionally evo- cative [9]. Whatever the limits of video syn- thesis, the production of images from nothing more than electrons is remi- niscent of painting's startling econ- omy-illusions formed from little more than colored mud. With the inception of the computer, a single electronic tool stands between the pre- conception and the conception of a visualization. The correctly pro- grammed computer can synthesize virtually any image. Taming electrons to produce pic- tures presents challenges, especially as the technology passes through early stages of development. For some ar- tists the technology may seem forbid- ding; but if the Renaissance is an in- structive precedent, artists will submit contributions that fall outside scien- tific intuition. Making imagination manifest requires imagination. Dur- ing the Renaissance, artists posed the problem of perspective and provided key intuitive solutions [10]. Dataists must engage in the process of reducing concepts to practice. One process is a recapitulation of the hand/eye coordination of the painter, carried out in the three-dimensional world of the sculptor. The artist grasps a stylus and draws in three-space- touching nothing, but imagining everything [11]. Another avenue is three-dimensional image acquisition, an extension of photography distin- guished by the treatment of real objects as volumes rather than flat surfaces. Holographers have already pointed the way, but for Dataists the volumes must be captured numeri- cally. Just as artists recognized the value of the camera obscura, their experimentation with range finding cameras will catalyze needed engin- eering developments. Another major preoccupation for Dataists must be the display of their works. If they are three-dimensional, should they not float in space? Artists have already contributed to inventing these display technologies, such as filmmaker Lenny Lipton's electroni- cally shuttered stereopticon [12] and the work of Dan Sandin, Mark Resch et al. in the field of parallax-barrier panoramagrams [13]. Artist hologra- phers have developed their medium in the face of technical challenges that have tempered the enthusiasm of sci- entists. Today holography is best ex- plored in museums specific to the pro- cess as an art [14]. Much of the three-dimensional work of Dataists is remarkable in that, unlike sculpture, its physical mass is that of the medium rather than the mass of a real object. The display itself is a real object, but the art is the image representation as data. With many im- plementations, one display can serve countless artworks, much as a televi- sion set exists as an entity separate from the videotapes it displays. This does not exclude a Dataist from making a solid sculpture based on the three-dimensional model, but such manufacture can postdate the forma- tive creative process. The dimension of time also falls well within the province of numerical analysis. Even a simple hand calcula- tor is a tool of enormous utility in film and video editing. The strict formal- isms of tempo in music may have evolved from an aesthetic necessity, and tempi deserve serious considera- tion in temporal visual art. Empirical data derived from recording video syn- thesis performances are one source of timing. These data can be character- ized by analysis and can engender formalisms. Complex rhythmic struc- tures that scarcely can be performed by a human [15] suggest that com- puted time relationships will open subtleties of expression. Just as the economics of cinema are much more burdensome than those of still photography, Dataists must deal with the cost multiplier of making moving pictures. It can be argued that Dataist engines of calculation are an expense far greater than the price of paint. Just as artistic integrity is com- promised by the huge budgets of the film studio, are not Dataists con- strained by equipment costs? Again, I DeWitt, Dataism 59</page><page sequence="4">turn to an archaeological example. In some primeval societies, red ocher was a decorative pigment available only to the privileged [16]. The silicon in a computer is smart sand, not a com- modity destined to be forever dear. When financial support is required, modest means can produce a telling sketch or sample of the funded work, inviting further investment. This is al- ready the practice when a script, story board or pilot production is submitted to producers, but how can visual artists participate? Consider that one expense in com- puter art is the measured resolution of the image. A motion image idea can be developed in low-resolution at low cost before a commitment is made to produce the final product [17]. In- deed, one low-resolution technology, the stroke display, presents a close analogy to the way in which a pencil sketch serves the painter. Although large and expensive com- puters may be called upon in indus- trial production, a curious facet of the so-called Turing Machine is that any digital computer can achieve equiv- alent results. The tradeoff is solely in time of execution [18]. Although there is a thousand-to-one difference between a million versus a billion cal- culations a second, the humblest micro can take on the mightiest super- computer when a timeless inspiration is at stake. When the Dataist uses a computer, regardless of its size, some of the labor in production has been automated. In contrast to the practices of filmmak- ing, where large groups of collabora- tors must be organized, the Dataist calls upon programs and digital im- ages from prior endeavors. With the development of their programming skills, Dataists can maintain the kind of creative integrity enjoyed by paint- ers, composers and writers in their solitary pursuits. The capacity to begin building where predecessors have stopped dis- tinguishes Dataists from the devolving world of modern art. An impetus to re- fine and perfect prior art is a reversal of the iconoclasm found in Dada and similar anti-art movements. When practices of the past become resources of the present, practice makes perfect. VENUES Artists who use computers face a di- lemma if they are lumped together by curators and critics solely on the basis of their medium. If computer art shows such as SIGGRAPH are primary venues, eclecticism blurs the distinc- tion between styles of expression. The grouping of artists by their medium is a curator's convenience, but categori- zation of artworks by their style, con- tent or historical cultural period is the preferred distinction for art historians and critics. The traditional media of drawing, painting and sculpture have been practiced throughout all history. They are generally grouped and ex- hibited according to their epoch. On the other hand, the new media of photography, motion pictures, video and computers have burst on the scene within a single century. Moreover, their appearance has been sequential over time. In this unprece- dented circumstance, it is not surpris- ing to encounter the categorization of artists by their medium rather than by their style of expression. Different styles may be lost on those curators who cannot see beyond the medium each artist uses. If computer art were routinely in- cluded in collections defined by style, the dilemma would be resolved; how- ever, rarely is this the case. The new media are excluded from collections, in part because they are not collectible in a traditional sense. There is no sin- gular objet d'art but rather a master template for striking endless copies. Collectors have small economic incen- tive to deal in cheap copies. Ironically, the very media that are excluded from collections are rou- tinely used as a service to document and study singular objets d'art. Com- puter image acquisition and analysis can produce objective data for archiv- al documentation [19]. Lithographic reproduction of photographs can publicize specific pieces, augmenting market value of each object. Interac- tive video can tour through collections [20]; films can introduce practicing artists; computers can inventory col- lections. The use of new media to document old media can be reversed. Works in old media-that is, drawings, paint- ings or sculptures-can be based on data generated by computers. The fin- ished objets d'art then fit into conven- tional art collections. Ronald Resch's Vegreville Pysanka [21] and Jean-Paul Agosti's Les Soixante-TreizeJardins [22] are examples of this antithesis. Al- though ingenious, it is disingenuous to insinuate Dataism into the collec- tors' marketplace through a Trojan horse strategy. A more enduring penetration of the fine art marketplace would call on the strength of Dataist art rather than mask it. For example, there is scarcely a museum that does not have an associated book store. These outlets provide some cash income for the mu- seum, but the shops also bestow credi- bility on the works of art celebrated in the purveyed literature. Normally, one does not buy the curated artworks themselves in the museum book store, but Dataist art could prove the excep- tion. Be it quality reproductions, vid- eotapes or computer disks, the mu- seum goer could return home with an equivalent to the art on display within the museum. The museum book store venue pre- sumes museum exhibition, not a likely scenario if collectors have a vested in- terest in non-duplicable art works. Yet risk-taking investors need not be de- prived of their rightful earnings. Art patrons simply need to accept that one measure of worth will include the copyrighted works of music and litera- ture. Ubiquitous distribution of per- fect copies in these arts has not dimin- ished the role of primary venues such as concert halls or libraries. Exclusive social circles may conse- crate artists from the avant-garde for exhibition in name galleries and pres- tigious museums [23], but Dataists can make a direct appeal to the public. The ubiquitous media of print and video can easily assimilate Dataist work. Color separations and video re- cordings are a windfall by-product of computer graphics. Desktop publish- ing, electronic mail networks and computer bulletin boards give the Dataist communications routes to re- place or bypass the cliques from which they are excluded [24]. A broadened marketplace for fine art does pose the question of univer- sality, and this test of aesthetic merit presents a meaningful challenge. What makes a work of art attractive? Why do certain works endure? It takes far more than novelty to meet these criteria. The test is not how Dataism would fare as a yet another ephemeral 'Post Modern' fad laden with aesthetic non sequiturs. It is not sufficient to say, 'made with a computer'. The question is, How would a broad audience re- spond to ownership of these art works? I believe that the qualities that will characterize successful Dataist art might be summarized in the word 60 DeWitt, Dataism</page><page sequence="5">'beauty'. This art will provide both immediate appeal and inexhaustible pleasure upon repeated viewings. Such criteria are not reserved for any one aesthetic. Dataism will encompass the work of many artists and many visions, but they will share an aspira- tion toward perfection. SUMMARY Conventions of the art marketplace, where objects are measured in worth by their singularity, are now chal- lenged by Dataists, whose works are perfectly duplicable. Dataism posits that aesthetic merit determines worth. Dataists are developing a formalism by using computer programs to promul- gate their artworks but, unlike sculp- ture, the works may have no physical mass. The time dimension can be in- voked to produce visualizations that dynamically change. Limits in expres- sion imposed by earlier forms of tech- nological art such as photography, motion pictures and video are now being rolled back, because Dataist art is not camera-dependent. Dataism will supplant the moribund epoch of Mod- ernism, its Establishment venues not- withstanding. In the arts, the power of beauty is greater than the beauty of power. References and Notes 1.
