Our "I" and history: cultural consciousness re gards its inner life as a self-creative and self sufficient process which consists of assimilating values and meanings generated by history; these values produced historically possess their own historical logic; by assimilating them, we intro duce to our interior all of history; the historical drama of Europe unfolds itself within us. The character of Western culture depends on striv ing for conscious creation of pure psyche, of pure history. A psyche which accumulates within itself the values generated by European history can find no freedom but by mastering the his torical process which creates all of psychic Eu rope. The society of conscious and liberated work is an historical model toward which culture gravitates by force of its internal logic. Cultural consciousness develops today in the direction of exploiting past labor for an ahistorical subjectiv ism. Thus arises the principal contradiction of modern culture: it cannot be equalized through some automatic progress . . . but requires a heroic turn of the will: an historical heroism as a life plan.

Everything may well be in excellent agreement, but usually there is some minute link overlooked, and it is this link which gives the chain the opposite meaning. ?Czeslaw Milosz, Man among Scorpion? I. Introduction The present paper addresses itself not to the Polish or even to the Eastern European reader. Its primary purpose is to introduce and contextualize Stanislaw Brzozowski (1878-1911), a figure little known in the West, and absent from the curriculum of the study of Continental philosophy and social theory. (Brzozowski's numerous writings remain untranslated into English.) This undertaking becomes all the more important once we consider that increasingly, after years of surreptitious recognition and ostensible disavowal, Polish letters deems Brzozowski one of the most fertile and fascinating Polish thinkers of the twentieth century. WTiat follows is an analysis focused on just one of many strands of one special text in his very broad oeuvre. Anchored in the contemporaneous reception of his Legend of Young Poland: Studies in the Structure of a Cultural Soul (1909)?a controversial critique of contem porary Polish society and literature?as well as in Brzozowski's turbulent</page><page sequence="3">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 523 career, my analysis offers a gradual exposition of his thoughts on history, on its nature and role in human life. Emerging at a time when the philosophy of history was reformulating conceptions of action, agency, and nationhood, Brzozowski's ideas on humanity, history, and historicity serve to problematize the host of post-Hegelian and Marxist discourses before the Great War.3 II. Brzozowski It is, nonetheless, the events of Brzozowski's public and private life? events bent on his destruction?that initially led me to take interest in his reflections on human agency vis-?-vis history. Brzozowski's faith in human ability and liberty over against brute force, as well as his erudition and diacritical incisiveness, seem ironic when juxtaposed with his biography: stricken by disease (tuberculosis), hounded by rumor, accused of collaborating with tsarism, and all at the height of Polish anti Russianness.4 The irony apparent here is what demands consideration of Brzozowski's notions of history and humanity?inconclusive though it may ultimately prove. "No! Io non sono morto. / Die tro me?cadavere / Lasciai la prima vita!" (No! I am not dead. / Inside me?a cadaver / I left my first life!) reads the first of its two telling mottoes.5 Making his publishing debut in 1900, Brzozowski established himself as a gadfly with the publication, four years later, of a series of trenchant polemical articles in the weekly Glos (Voice) .6 As a critic, he made it his rule to question all that is static and traditional; he was unsympathetic and uncompromising. On a metalevel, he was critical of mildness in critique as a sign of intellectual feebleness; in a Nietzschean cadence, he called for pitiless writing, "with blood, poison, bile, whatever is in you, only not lymph."7 It is, then, little wonder that Brzozowski came to be grossly misunderstood. According to Milosz, this was fundamentally because "the problems which occupied him came to the surface in Polish and European intellectual circles only after the Second World War."8 Ahead of his time, he laid the foundations for a new national problematic and the emergence of new currents in Polish cultural life.9 Brzozowski's intellectual trajectory began, partly in revolt against his Catholic environment, with Darwinism?soon rejected by him, along with the deterministic scientific worldview in general, when he came under the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche. He eventually "converted" to Karl Marx (though not to Marxist orthodoxy) and arrived at a socialism invested with strong ethical commitment (though without joining the Polish Socialist Party). After the Russian and Polish revolu tions of 1905-7, his views on Marxism underwent some modification.</page><page sequence="4">524 NEW LITERARY HISTORY He saw the need to defend early Marxian thought against Engelsianism, and against its frequent misapplication or falsification?this he did without abandoning his own critical perspective on it. According to Andrzej Walicki, Marxism "appeared to him in a dual guise: as a radical negation of the creative act, and at the same time as its magnificent confirmation."10 As the organization of a collective effort and the formulation of a "philosophy of labor" became his primary concerns, Brzozowski was in favor of the voluntaristic, activist reading of Marx. Through this constantly refined ideological positioning, he became a major exponent of the antipositivist generation of Polish modernists. As Milosz summarily put it, "At first an advocate of Young Poland [Polish modernism], then its accuser, he never forfeited the sense of solidarity with the 'new wave'" (MS 39). Still critical of the Church, he in the end approached the Catholic-modernist view of humanity. A misdemeanor at nineteen effectively ruined Brzozowski's life. After his arrest (and brief incarceration) on political grounds soon afterward, the unfortunate incident, interpreted as embezzlement, became a source of scandal and a link in the gathering "evidence" of espionage for Okhrana, the late Russian Empire's secret police.11 Brzozowski steadfastly denied the charge and demanded legal justice for calumny. The ensuing persecution, which intensified after his departure from Russian terri tory, was never balanced by a campaign to exculpate him. With few allies and many enemies, Brzozowski became a "one-man army." In 1905, faced with mounting adversity and deteriorating health, he left and eventually settled in Italy, from which twice he returned for inconclusive public hearings organized by the Socialist Party in Krakow. In Florentine self-exile, charged with treason by Polish authorities and sentenced therefore to a "civil death," he was meanwhile feverishly active as a writer. All of his major, most ambitious writings date from this period. He left behind an impressive body of work, which, after his death, gained him still greater fame and notoriety as a versatile, formidable thinker. A statement from 1926, by his contemporary Witold Klinger, implies a lasting regard for Brzozowski's legacy but also the lingering stigma attached to his name. Like Brzozowski before him, Klinger lays responsibility and blame on "Poles in general, their mentality, their habits," calling at once for an expiatory gesture: "But guilt demands expiation ... I call on the representatives of literature ... I call on people who, despite their party membership are still capable of indepen dent thought ... I call on the free citizens of a free country, whose honor will not I hope allow them to echo the whisperings of Okhrana, to pay belated tribute to his [Brzozowski's] creative efforts and flights, his martyrdom and saintly death, his forgotten, exiled grave, and so mistakenly profaned memory" (MS 183). Brzozowski's personal struggle</page><page sequence="5">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 525 was palpably intertwined with the raison d'?tre for his work. His critical and philosophical fervor was most intense in Idee: Wst?p do filozofii dojrzalosci dziejowej [Ideas: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Histori cal Maturity] (1910), Giosy wsr?d nocy: Studia nad przesileniem romantycznym kultury europejskiej (Voices in the Night: Studies on the Romantic Solstice of European Culture), and Pami?tnik (Diary) most notably, however, it pervades the more than 500 pages comprising his Legend of Young Poland}2 The latter is, in every sense, a lived book, as a glance at its poignant dedication can confirm: "most dreaded moments, when the soul hangs in a vacuum beset by the world's hatred?To you, whose devoted, precious friendship was my sustenance, the ground to which tended the unspoken word, as a seed to its soil... I dedicate and ascribe this book." Legend, written two years before his death, secured Brzozowski's reputation as an engag? thinker. It is by far his most important intellec tual contribution, and the only one to see two editions during his lifetime. Andrzej Mencwel "defines" Legendas "constituting], in [Polish] letters, its own genre of critical-cultural treatise, without precedents and prob ably without imitations."13 Analyzing responses to the book, he writes: [Its] reception meant?for some?making it into a national bible, into a holy book; one should view from its horizon not only the literature of Young Poland [Mloda Polska], but our entire literature, and even cultural history. Its prophe cies foretold a future in which a new visionary figure of national fate ought to fulfill itself. The negation of Legend. . . , its criticism, did not at all mean treating this work as debatable, doubtful or abortive, as the expression of another, though legitimate cultural position, but carried its exposure and rejection?the work was to be deprived of its right to existence, condemned to non-being and oblivion. It is only an exaggeration, and not a fallacy, to say that Legend . . . was long suspended between consecration and burning (HR6).14 Mencwel sees these two "legends"?the apologetic and the liquidating?as "constantly intersect [ing] with the dominant ideological orders and political camps of early twentieth-century Poland: the national, with its division into folk and nationalistic; the Catholic, with its conservative and reformist wings; finally, the socialist, with first its revolutionary and evolutionary, and later its communist and democratic currents" (HR 9 10). It appears that a stark duality o? Legend's reception was in place from the beginning. This may be because Brzozowski's convictions fall between two opposing notions of social history: Christian idealism and the dialectical materialism of Marx. Both groups laid claim to his writing, just as both fell short of fully justifying these claims. Again, Mencwel's holistic observations prove valuable: "The dissertation 'works,' so to speak, on several levels at once?ontology of culture, its epistemol ogy, ethics and aesthetics, having also social and political consequences"</page><page sequence="6">526 NEW LITERARY HISTORY (HR 12). The early reception, unprepared to deal with the work in all of these dimensions simultaneously, challenged by its complexity, was therefore marked by unidimensional interests, primarily the social political kind. "Hence the patent and flat ideologization of reception at least in its initial decades. Brzozowski's thesis, while presenting a suggestive phenomenology of Polish and European culture, was also, a personal dismissal of its author's accusers" (HR 12). "Trovan mi duro / E io lo so: / Pensar li fo!" (They find me tough / And I know it: / I make them think!) reads, aptly, the book's second motto.15 With its checkered reception, the result of a dynamic, densely checkered cultural land scape, Legend was too often perceived as the fruit of a checkered past. III. Historiosophy, Historicism, Society As a prelude to discussing Brzozowski's philosophy of history?or historiosophy, to borrow from Polish scholarship16?we must, if only briefly, address the role and character of philosophical thought in the writer's output as a whole. For in this respect, too, Legend holds a privileged place. Though not a systematic presentation of a doctrine, it was intended to conclude his life's work up to that point (L 543n). The author, in his dialectical pursuit of legitimate theoretical ground and support for his endeavor,17 refers to an array of thinkers, freely borrow ing, expanding upon, or discrediting their ideas. His is not an operation planned rigidly in advance?and from this it derives its beauty. This, however, makes difficult a clean extraction of the book's philosophical tissue. The nonsystematic and eclectic nature of his presentation reflects the dynamism of Brzozowski's critical views, something which may well have been a matter of principle: "Any detached idea, any individual thought, is only true to the extent to which it is capable of life transformations; what cannot change and live is nothing" (L 548). To philosophize is to transform one's existence; when thought lives, it is itself transformed. Opening his study of Legend, Cezary Rowi?ski notes: "Stanislaw Brzozowski's thought has nothing of the static in it, all the elements of his work are in constant motion."18 Further on, he argues that Brzozowski's "historicism does not constitute a cohesive, compre hensive historiosophic system in the sense that Giambattista Vico's, G. W. F. Hegel's, or even Oswald Spengler's or Arnold Toynbee's does. It was merely a nodal point of his ideology, of his worldview"; he should be understood not as a philosopher per se, but as an ideologue and a creator of a Weltanschauung (SB 8, 26). Philosophy figures in Brzozowski's work only insofar as it serves social transformation; its function is secondary to that of ideology.</page><page sequence="7">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 527 Most importantly, Brzozowski contests the materialistic conception of historical dialectical inevitability championed by Marx. His own version of historical materialism is nonteleological and nonrationalistic.19 Strongly inspired by Vico, he believes truth?the principle of history?to be the work (intellectual and physical) of men. For Vico, history was scienza: made by man from within each historical moment, and known in the making. To the degree that the universal cyclical pattern of corsi e ricorsi (advances and regressions) was governed by Providence, it was unpre dictable, eternal, and ideal (storia ideale eterna). Brzozowski, by compari son, sees history as linear and attributes its unpredictability to the irrational creative power of humanity and to nature, which humanity transforms into culture. Social life, as it springs from the elementary creative energy of the "deep I," is "the capacity to counter the [inhu man] unknown with the [human] unknown" (L 131-32). Citing Vico, he describes society as an "irrational, deepest psychic relationship," an "emotional fact," and a "variously felt blind necessity [mus] for the coordination of our acts" (L 112; L2 109). In general, the social, collective nature of our psyche remains under the surface of conscious societal convictions (L 112); it persists as a "dark collective 7," situated "beyond the rim of our logical, conscious thought, open to clear formulation" (L2 109). This emphasis on the subliminal, irrational basis of society is a considerable difference between Brzozowski's take on history and that of Vico. Elaborating on the affinities between Brzozowski and Vico, Rowi?ski maintains that it is from the latter that the Polish thinker adopts historical relativism, where the self is a historical construct and truth resides not in correspondence of concepts to external reality, in abstract conceptual stability, but in human acts of creation (SB 24). History?as the product of humanity?is neither divine design nor an automatic, mechanical progression imposed upon life. It cannot exist or be comprehended apart from human creative activity, from an "active logic" (as opposed to the "straightforward logic of concepts" [L2 110]), individual and collective. "The primal fact is the real, immediate, living relations between sympathizing people, all else is just a product and result" (L 112). Society goes hand-in-hand with humanity?a common wealth (wsp?lnota) uniting the dead, the living, and the still unborn. Although Brzozowski does not refer to the study of history as la scienza nuova, and so does not situate it among other human sciences, he takes Vico's argument to support a realist view: history is everywhere and exceeds individual experience. This makes it the absolute, universal ground for all philosophical inquiry and the totality of human discourse (L 8). "I believe," writes Brzozowski, "there exists a certain reality to the concept of history and the fundamental ideas of the philosophy of</page><page sequence="8">528 NEW LITERARY HISTORY history. There exists a certain collective, self-creative reality that corre sponds more or less to what the philosophers of history called the spirit of history, the idea of humanity. Only it is not any idea of providence, nor any verdict or plan suspended above humankind" (L 242). Reading Brzozowski's work, one is struck by his awareness of the past and yet his firm situatedness in the present. The historical density of his own day was, to him, no point of saturation: not quite a turning point, or merely a period of instability and transition (unless all else is also seen as transitory). The state of crisis perceived by Marx as well as by Edmund Husserl was diagnosed in the rhetoric of finalism.20 History was directed toward a specific (approaching) end as, in the words of sociologist Zdzislaw Krasnod?bski, the "ultimate, definitive settlement of the fate of humankind."21 But unlike Marx or Husserl?for whom, regardless of its crisis, the superiority of the present was certain?Brzozowski sees modernity as being at stake. The aesthetic posturing of European modernism has led to "intellectual incoherence" (L 256), indifference, and stagnation, where genuine values were at risk of disintegration. In contrast to historical whiggery or presentism, Brzozowski's historiogra phy is prospective and fraught with apprehension.22 Above all, he ad dresses futurity as a constitutive dimension of history?with the hope it will discover for itself the viability of current ideas, making effective use of them in the conscious creation of history. Rowi?ski stipulates that in Brzozowski's grounded historiosophy there is no place for transcen dence as such (SB 26). But with the "Age of Ideology" in perspective, however, it is equally fair to say that Brzozowski's idea of a creative human conquest of nature and his tendency to absolutize history are indeed transcendental. In lieu of historical determinism?be it teleological predeterminism (cosmic necessity) or scientific-positivist determinism (materialistic in evitability)23?Brzozowski offers a fundamental indeterminism of his tory (L 130). Randomness, seen as a loss of man's control over the inhuman elements and historical events, has an important, albeit subordinate, place in Brzozowski's worldview; it is there to incite human action by wrestling with our creativity. Randomness is mirrored in spontaneity (as different from systematic organization), which likewise presupposes and reinforces social dynamism?society being "an instinctually, sponta neously self-assembling coordination of active dispositions" (L2 111). When Brzozowski declares that "to live spiritually means to toe the line of greatest resistance [to impersonal nature]," he is incorporating spontane ity into a durable self-creative, self-liberatory type of existence. The social individual must not lapse into ahistorical subjectivism, but learn to make and absorb history of his own accord, freely and responsibly, remember ing that he is as much a part of the future as of the distant past.24</page><page sequence="9">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 529 At the same time, an overarching metaphysical continuity, the unin terrupted flow of cause and effect, has no place in Brzozowski's notion of history. Instead, "[e]ach cultural world, at the moment of its inception, was something new, unparalleled, unwarranted, chaotic, sinful: it came into being with the birth of some new type of existence, a type which was a negation of those types preceding it, a revolt against them, a break in continuity" (L 18). That is, an emerging epoch is an unforeseeable but virtually limitless possibility, a confrontation, and although the Hegelian antithesis comes to mind, nowhere do the specters of necessity, inevitability, and revolution based on class struggle rear their heads. For modernism, as one such historical-cultural forma tion, a synthesis with the past was not forthcoming. It is because of this that Brzozowski mourns: " [ W] e have lost our sense of historical causality, the deep linkage of the various spheres of life. We have become accustomed to considering modern culture a result. A result from which we draw only so much as we need for our individual?reduced, cut to a humiliating, immature size by the needs of a society without self-rule? one who makes almost exclusively individual use of his historical aspirations. That is why we cannot think of culture as a great collective work, and do not experience it [culture] from its active side" (L 281). The reasons for historical uncertainty and unease are clear: humanity must continuously struggle to transform or transcend the inhuman forces of nature, with the real possibility of defeat. This emphasis on human fortitude and order arising from spontaneous action in the face of chaos orients most of Legends argument. He writes with vibrant urgency, with anxiety but also with hope for the future of Young Poland, which he sees as being at the crossroads of cultural consciousness: "History is a human creation, and now is the moment when buds are forming, centuries coming of age" (L 58). Brzozowski's ideal society is an open one.25 The liberated life consists in truth that is not merely theoretical or conceptual, but practical and self-evident. Truth must be understood qualitatively as the historical valuation of our experience as productive members of society, since "[o]nly when considered part of the historical experience of human collectivity does thought reveal its efficiency" (L 110). Truth is accessible to individuals who actively partake in social activity; if it is to be found in humanity at all, it is manifest in social existence (L 542). Truth can only be thought if that thought translates itself into, is subsumed by, willful collective action; otherwise thought lies fallow. Neither, for that matter, should truth be sought in the past, under the assumption that it has been deposited there, accumulated in the form of collective memory awaiting revitalization, for "he who seeks 'truth' of 'knowledge' in the fossils of bygone life, in the province of already completed being, is a</page><page sequence="10">530 NEW LITERARY HISTORY theologian" (L 99). Only the current historical moment, if imbued with genuine creative effort, vigorous will, fresh awareness, and socially oriented cognition can assure individual liberty (swoboda) and imbue life with truth. The individual and the collective, though both unable to compre hend history as a totality, should methodically engage in historical hermeneutics. "Only a thorough acquaintance with the psychical struc ture of an age, with the whole composition of contemporary culture, in a word, only an understanding of historical language," might prevent misrepresentation (L 203). Attention to the language of history is a must, since words, by obscuring their own historicity, obscure history. They become a source of dogmatism, metaphysics, and mysticism, suppressing historical consciousness, oppressing creativity, and severing our ties with the present?so that we are ruled by, instead of ruling, history. This regimen opens onto the broader issue of intellectual discipline. For Brzozowski, "lack of mental discipline, the lack of a culture of thought?makes our struggle with bad antiquated habits of thought very difficult" (L 113). Progressive, liberating thought consists of "the discovery of all the secret passages and crannies, through which escapes our intellectual integrity, masculine will, through which black waters of sloth and passivity intrude into and flood the earthwork of lucid thought" (L 113). It is the awareness and analysis of fault lines?of displacement and flattening of both affect and intellect?that safeguard the historical moment against crisis. IV. History and Young Poland Nietzsche, highly esteemed by Brzozowski,26 believed that "History, so far as it serves life, serves an unhistorical power" and "Only that which has no history is definable."27 To this, Brzozowski could have responded: Life can only be comprehended within history and what has no history is not worth definition. He anchors his ideas in the historical contingency of all individual/collective knowledge of history: "Each self is a point tra versed by history, in everyone keeps watch an historical sentinel," and each self cannot conceive of history outside of itself (L 257). This is not to advocate any extreme or Nietzschean subjectivism. Such "poeticized slavery" (L 266) disempowers thought, to the extent that one ceases to be able to construct solid notions of the past?or, for that matter, to commit oneself to the productive organism that is society. As long as one does not translate subjectivity into subjectivism/solipsism?and so, into radical skepticism toward universal truths and values?extreme historiocultural relativism can in fact be avoided. Brzozowski contends</page><page sequence="11">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 531 that "life carried out in society, the unceasing transformation of our collective psyche, constitutes not the content of our conscious life but merely its background. Our thought does not strive to master this process, but only stems from it and converts it into its own purely subjective experience" (L 287). It is this background that is probed in historicizing the foreground. Though cognition cannot reconstitute the entirety of an individual life, as it springs from the social, it can express it: "Man is more profound than any thought, any statement articulated by him: to discover life beyond thought, to present it?means to reveal thought's deepest substance. Man, living and dying once and for all in a certain way: is not this . . . reality of the greatest substance" (L 157). Hence, the historical nature of human existence, its collective psychical constitution and its inexpressible depth, can be studied by interpretive thought that refrains from subjectivism and accepts its own partiality and contingency. WTien assessing claims to historical objectivity, collec tive ideas must be weighed against subjective experience. In his study of Young Poland, Brzozowski deploys the concept of epoch, or epochal spirit, but in fact a major thrust of his thought is in direct opposition to historical generalizations that are operational and explana tory}9, Brzozowski's historicism is not guilty of any of the three historicist fallacies: the inscrutable past, the homogenous past, the homogenous present-day perspective.29 He fills a generalized vision of romanticism and Polish moderna with exceptions, differentiations, and links that make any generalization tentative. There is talk of "identity," yet this applies chiefly to the cultural milieu of Polish artists and intelligentsia. On the other hand, it is individuals from such groups who, he hopes, will (soon, someday?) understand and take up his complaints against the general cultural milieu. Brzozowski argues for a future cultural synthesis of a scattered national will and a "half-unwitting socioeconomic process" into a potent organism?a postulate he invokes with the emotional energy of a revolutionary (L 114-15). He notes that in order to provide a firm, organic foundation for action, our consciousness must develop cultural forms capable of summing up the consequences of our daily life "in an extraconscious basis of action" (L 117). Brzozowski's statements on the imperative to think and think through the present historical moment are in keeping with the responsible resolution to learn from history, as opposed to recasting or rehearsing the past?itself an act of violence, reduction, and, ultimately, destruction. At the same time, it is our emotions and our will, rather than reason, that integrate (or discard) new experiences in a causal chain, aggregating lived experi ence to history (L 440). Brzozowski's about-face on Young Poland was an attempt to conceptu alize, however provisionally and critically, his own time. Mloda Polska is</page><page sequence="12">532 NEW LITERARY HISTORY represented as a perspectival, heterogenous historical moment (unique on all counts), making one celebrate it on some levels while condemn ing it on others. In one of his earlier works, Brzozowski claims that national spirit is the "creative fountainhead of individual souls" and an "elemental spiritual act" exceeding all naturalistic and evolutionary conceptualizations of the human species.30 He envisions Young Poland, moderna, as just such a deeply felt "act"?the forging of new spiritual substance. The movement is not, therefore, to be identified with Western modernism, which encompasses for him the clash and fusion of old and new hierarchies, reckless technological progress, and biological emancipation, buttressed by conflicting theories about the past, present, and future. At its worst, modernism ushers in decadence and the atrophy of human will, negating human values and humanity altogether. Although strongly influenced by modernism, moderna is principally a quest for novel, independent cultural sources of national activity. It is as much the result of modernism as it is a rebellion against its emptiness. As such, moderna is a working term to be discarded once this goal is achieved or, alternatively, when the goal proves increasingly unattain able and in need of substantial revision to suit changing historical realities. Considering Brzozowski's stance as a cultural commentator on his time, it is crucial to understand that he saw himself virtually alone in a battle for authentic values and against the affectation he saw as pervasive in contemporary society.31 His individuality and individualism were in large part provoked by the surrounding myopias and blindnesses. His appeal is not to commonly held beliefs about the significance or insignificance of historical phenomena, but to those traditional values that have become neglected and distorted in the modern cultural malaise. Responsible for directing the energy of the masses?uncon scious of their own historical context, power, and historicity?the historian, aware of the historical in its multiple dimensions, possesses the authority and the autonomy to diagnose the status quo and propose remedies, in the hope of communicating his ideas to whoever is prepared to listen. The historical cycle and the writing of history continue on every level in the manner of repetition with variation. This accounts equally for a belief in the irretrievable loss of the past as for the hope of an eventual awareness of the historical process and our role in it. V. Crisis Discourse In The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (1937), Husserl sought to establish the telos of philosophy. Writing more</page><page sequence="13">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 533 than twenty years after Brzozowski, he had the advantage of seeing the world come asunder and reintegrate itself under an altered power structure, swollen with international popular ideologies. Both writers share a sustained diagnosis of crisis at two weighty, precarious moments in history: the first shortly before World War I, the second directly preceding World War II. Indeed, Brzozowski deserves to be placed in the tradition of modern crisis discourse that began with Vico and passed through Husserl. In his study of Polish catastrophism, Leszek Gawor discusses the emergence, following the antipositivist revolt against rationalized, pro gressive history, of a new interpretation of historical change. This reinterpretation opened up the possibility of an unexpected, telos-free break in the historical process through a cataclysm. Progress was replaced by crisis, which broke with the principle of linear historical continuity. Crisis became a fundamental principle and norm in early twentieth century analyses of European ferment. As an integral part of cata strophic thought, it was interpreted still more pessimistically as a "fall, a radical break in the functioning of a given society."32 Catastrophism also emphasized the irrationality of human activity as an internal force of disintegration in social formations. The concomitant divergence of individual and societal goals undercut a common value system, splitting society into the elite and the masses, the latter impulse-driven and destructive to all individual creative initiative (43-45). Brzozowski's historical diagnosis has elements of catastrophism, as does Husserl's. Both qualify as alternative particular catastrophism, one of four categories distinguished by Gawor, and the most moderate one (24-25). This type of catastrophism "accentuates above all the erosion of all essential values deciding the specificity of individual cultures (civilizations). . . . The destruction of these values is, however, not final, but is formulated as a state of emergency or crisis which it is possible to overcome" (24-25). For reasons that are unclear, Gawor regards all four models of catastrophism as "the purest form of historiosophic pessimism" (25). Brzozowski's breed of historical relativism, however, presents an antidote for the crisis of Polish culture. History and culture continue to be reproduced even by individuals who lack an active-critical (as opposed to passive-contemplative) consciousness of their historicity. In fact, the material participant-makers of history are often devoid of reflexive thought, and spared its pitfalls. By contrast, thinkers and artists have every means of becoming a social force, of creating a novel, ideogenetic type of man.33 Instead of shouldering this responsibility, however, the modernists withdrew into an asocial realm, resorting to delusions of sovereignty, to consumption, and to parasitism. In this way, Brzozowski argues, they contribute only to social discontinuity and</page><page sequence="14">534 NEW LITERARY HISTORY discontent. It is they who perpetuate the crisis in Poland's cultural and political life; but it is also they who could stimulate and consolidate a national consciousness. Brzozowski insists that, as conscious selves, we are largely formations of historical circumstances. This, however, does not prevent us from positioning ourselves on the boundaries of history: "[0]ne must em brace history, take it into one's breast so as to call out to oneself, to the world, on its behalf a threatening and essential: what for?" (L 9). The answer to this question should, first and foremost, be concrete. We are responsible for history and for the effort to understand it. Because our psyche and our present position always spring from a specific social context, "to dream of independence from history is to dream of self annihilation" (L 7). History is at once everything we do and all of our projections?the fixed identities, images, myths, phantasms, and abso lutes issuing from our mind.34 It can only be shaped from within, through active participation in it, beyond which humanity cannot claim its existence. [B]eyond every psyche and its forms there is that which produces them: the collective struggle of humanity for its life and maintenance. The history of humanity is for us an undeniable and ultimate, concrete reality: it is in it that man meets the extrahuman and creates his destiny. When we strive to understand this destiny independently of history, we hypostasize only moments of the latter and change them into sovereign entities. When we strive to liberate ourselves from history, we fall prey to uncomprehended history. And every metaphysics, every supra- or extrahistorical conception of life is uncomprehended history, a mythology of history. (L 9) Brzozowski locates in this very epistemic picture the source of all modern error and illusion (L 9). The Legend of Young Poland is in part an inventory of failings in fin-de-si?cle European society. Brzozowski con cedes that the project is more fundamental than he previously thought: "One should create the very ground one wants to plough, substantiate, bring to consciousness the mistakes one wants to fight" (L 304). He traces the general unawareness of faults to the mistaken sense of identity in which, instead of identification with history (a particular time), the psyche ideologically assimilates the historical past to its own present, seen as the culmination of history. "Until we seek absolute sense in ourselves only, in the accidental configuration of our consciousness," until we continue to ascribe to it "permanent ontic value," we will not surpass the epistemic limitations of our derivativeness (L 9, 314). Because of this derivative status "it is clear that [the psyche] will be prone to collisions when it chooses to take itself for the basis of action" (L15).</page><page sequence="15">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 535 The greatest, underlying flaw is, then, an extrahistorical view of our historical time?"taking that which is only a moment and an outcome of human history for the key of being" (L 9). Our experience of reality must be consensual in order to be a referent in the world. Otherwise, it remains in the isolated subjective domain, outside the social, where "our spiritual transformations appear to us as changes in the very essence of the world" (L 37). As long as such atomism holds sway, it is impossible for the individual to recognize the vital coherence and progression of history, in which no one historical time is privileged, no final end is achieved, and yet the present does not succumb to passivity as a result. Rather, it continues the struggle for humanity's survival, where the past left off, as its direct result. VI. Myth and Legend In Legend, Brzozowski emphasizes his uninterest in formulating a genealogy (as a static structural framework) of Polish modernism, choos ing instead to conduct an inquest into its desired demise. It is Brzozowski's conviction that only such a method could bring about an affirmative solution. Brzozowski endorses the theory of myth found in the Marxist revisionist philosophy of Georges Sorel. In Sorel's conception, myth, based on the accumulated knowledge of past generations, is a mental image for galvanizing the will and transforming individuals into histori cal actors.35 Sorel sets myth above reason as a valuable framework for interpreting social reality, its antirationalism allowing for the legitima tion of revolutionary activity in the face of the status quo. Brzozowski trades the Sorelian discussion of proletarian anarchy for one about creativity, partly because he seems to understand revolution as a critical shift in social consciousness without recourse to irrational violence. He envisions creative change as a great, birthlike exertion, a straining against personal boundaries and cultural demarcations, though not eliminating them: "Life's limit?it is always a line of resistance, never of serenity, never of possession. The creator's truth is always how he sustained and created and not how he considered and possessed himself. That which exists in the creator, as consciousness, is always relatively late, less profound; the rigidity of death rather than the thrust of life. The most essential life is not where one is already conscious, but where consciousness is produced, mined" (L 198). The dangers of noncreative living are self-evident: "He who does not create [tworzy] permanent things is himself processed \przetwarzanyY (L 75). Brzozowski describes social myth as capable of "attracting not established, mechanized forms of action, but precisely creativity" (L</page><page sequence="16">536 NEW LITERARY HISTORY 132). It is for him a heroic "plan of action," a "building of life into the future" (L 132, 134). He also refers to myth as the "logic of creation" that "gives us methods of thinking about what must be accomplished," facilitating our conscious and conscientious preparation for carrying it out (L 133). The inverse of this creative logic, as manifested by the modernists interrogated in Legend, is described in the following passage: To see, to become aware of our creativity, we must associate it with some mental shape: when we do not rely on a myth that leads us to real deeds, we must fall prey to one of these formations of past culture which comprise our intellectual atmosphere. If the world were the work of a pure and lawless ego, if society consisted of magi holding supernatural power over the world, if life was only someone's dream or contemplation, our self could find its liberty without leaving itself. Today, explaining the self with the aid of the products of thought and culture belonging to other epochs, we attain essentially only this: that our own self becomes a legend which can be told, which can be dreamt of. (L 118) The "legend" of Ml oda Polska is a reversible concept; the term is meant at once to castigate the status quo and to rouse the ethos of mlodopolskosc.36 Brzozowski repeatedly qualifies what factors contribute to legend-formation in a society where entire strata profit from the self motivated labor of others (namely, the real members of an institution or nation). These are, it appears, accumulations of previous myths that have been decontextualized and aestheticized. Contrary to social myth, legends are mental constructs debilitating, paralyzing the psyche: they do not lead to productivity, but to laxity, atomization, and death. Thus, modernism is a "legend of lawlessness," as opposed to the moral mythopoeic freedom of the preceding Zeitgeist (L 218). The myth of Young Poland, then, burns bright as "free labor, mature law, beaming thought"; the awakening of Young Poland, a battlefield (pobojowisko), to this myth is wholly contingent upon a "real flesh-and-blood victory" of the working class (L 135-36). Brzozowski aims to unify Poland "as active idea, as myth, with the elementary and direct nature of life and its deliberate, economic exertion"?a process described elsewhere in the book as an "act of synthesis of the cultural will, consumed by impotence yet reliable, with an un- or semi-conscious socioeconomic process" (L 221). This brings me to the question of history and nationhood. One of the last passages of Legend reads: "Our thought demands, in effect, a position that would be able to encompass, to unify in itself, the manifold postulates growing out of cultural life. Stemming from the nation and growing into it, our thought must find a point of view that would allow it to encompass mentally and simultaneously its difference from and unity with the thought of other nations" (L 549). Thought seeks empowerment, a domination over the cultural event, the ultimate</page><page sequence="17">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 537 purpose of which would be a consciousness of history and one's active participation in it?the conscious creation of history. Further, history is never just national: it is also world history, the history of the human race, without fixed arbitrary and geopolitical or ethnic divisions, united in its labor. The nation is merely a complex that allows one to grasp one's historicity in more detail by encouraging contrasts/comparisons with other ethnic unities. Brzozowski's obsession with creativity/productivity?the one coexten sive with the other?must, therefore, be understood within the greater, supra-Polish context. Progress is embraced locally in order to fulfill humanity's potential at each historical moment. Poland's sociohistorical and biological weakness in the face of transformative tasks puts it at risk of historical insignificance and continuing cultural corruption and disintegration (L 335). What for Polish ?migr? romanticism (in Brzozowski's dialectical view, activistic and voluntaristic) was a bonafide situation of crisis, of cultural thought in physical exile?forced to withdraw from the nation but connected with it spiritually, symbolically, and politically?is for Polish modernism an idle aesthetic choice over multiple possibilities of action, a justification for exaggerated and counterproductive passions. Alienation, severing one's productive ties with the nation, while continuing to live off its economic effort, can only be detrimental. Its result: spiritual death, since "[t]he nation is the psyche's relation to being: the psyche's existential significance is within it, grows out of it. It cannot find its life beyond the nation" (L 500). Romanticism's weakness persists into modernism "only as an error, but voluntary weakness, weakness as idea, lifelessness?as the purpose of life?is an enemy and an obstacle" (L 239). Such intentional ineffective ness, immaturity, infantility even, is eminently false (as truth cannot exist without human strength) and not history-worthy (L 224, 142). Reading the sweeping complaints levelled at his contemporaries by Brzozowski, belaboring especially their lack of stamina, one is reminded of Gianni Vattimo's ilpensiero dehole, or "weak thought," as elaborated in The End of Modernity: Nihilism and Hermeneutics in Postmodern Culture. Although Vattimo reserves the term for postmodern philosophy, it has relevance for historical hermeneutics. The interpreter leaves his object of interpretation without certainty of its significance, resulting in a weak (postfoundationalist) ontology, nihilistic at the core: nothing has the status of Being, but can only represent ephemeral being (s) .37 The gist of Brzozowski's charges against Mloda Polska is its "weak thought." His interest lies not in possibilities, but in actualities, in the praxis of truth and the truth of praxis?this monism missing from the stunted creative impulses of mlodopolskosc. The idea of intellectual vulnerability is con veyed by terms such as cultural automystification or autohypnosis, used to</page><page sequence="18">538 NEW LITERARY HISTORY describe the Polish modernists' preoccupation with form and perfor mance, their disenchantment with and mistrust of history (L 336). Noteworthy here is their transvaluation of romantic ideals, whereby ethics (like politics) becomes aestheticized?an idea traceable to Nietzsche's statements about modernity. Modernism's suspension be tween the historical past and an actual present or future brings to mind the Nietzschean notions of the negation and affirmation of becoming. These two cultural models each lead to the establishment of a wilt one weak, slavish, the other strong, masterly. Polish modernism seems to be suspended between alternatives, unable to define itself due to its contradictory relationship with reality, as if any choice would be too concrete, hence reconciliatory or capitulatory. The mask of superiority so characteristic of modernism is built around this position of nonacqui escence toward any concretization, whether as action or inaction (both of which could then be judged by a collective, working-class ethic). Furthermore, the state of suspension benefits a kind of pretentious, provisional cultural production that removes the pressure of definite decisions and postpones unequivocal outside judgment. It is clear why a position of this kind is fraught with contradictions ultimately threaten ing even to destroy the sum total of aesthetic sensibilities and elements utilized and reproduced in it. In Brzozowski's view, the corollary of such a tentative, unfounded participation in the social sphere is an individual shorn of creativity, victim of his own self-distinction and enshrinement, for whom society is necessary even as he overtly denounces its values. (This perspective renders all attempts at resistance to society absurd.) Feebleness of thought is categorized as imitative and uncreative. The true motor of a creative act is a powerful irrational conception of the future creation, and not a mere channelling of historical circumstances to new local syntheses. "To think of creation, one must think in categories of the non existent, and make this thought of the non-existent one's force leading to its creation. . . . the logical self becomes here only the scaffolding of a crane. That which one wishes to create becomes a force that creates itself (L236). The history of civilization is, for Brzozowski, a process of increasing sociobiological complexity. It takes place by "fits and starts" of creative revolution, rather than in a uniform, gradual manner. The reference to Henri-Louis Bergson 's 1907 work is deliberate. Brzozowski became familiar with Creative Evolution while revising Legend (of which he composed three versions between 1906 and 1909), even though the former was first published in English in 1907. Many of the observations voiced by Bergson resonate with Brzozowski; the main relevant differ ence between them seems to be the former's belief that creativity (and</page><page sequence="19">STANISLAW BRZOZOWSKI, PHILOSOPHER 539 existence, qua persistence) is possible only by way of evolution (which absorbs past achievements, providing memory and identity), and not, as for Brzozowski, revolution (which Bergson sees as an inherently destruc tive event).38 It is because of the intrinsically confrontational, conflictual nature of sociocultural existence with respect to the past that Brzozowski conceptualizes change as revolutionary. "Every cultural world arose not from a logical analysis of the preceding one, but from a completely new theme, from a negation ofthat preceding it" (L 21). Cultural conscious ness, in its tendency to break with the past, must mature into a "consciousness creating culture" (L 337) that incorporates and pre serves what it challenges. Analysis, criticism, reinterpretation of the past are formative aspects of contemporaneity and the actuality of subsequent ages. Most important, then, is continuity with the past?an awareness of one's participation in the creative process of history that is not contin gent upon the forgetting or destruction of the past. Brzozowski does not envision human transformation as something uniform or gradual, but as an elemental upheaval causing an upsurge in productivity. VII. Conclusion In 1904, writing for The Polish Gazette on the topic of his own contribution to Poland's cultural debate, Brzozowski names ideological courage as a crucial component of visionary historical insight: "To take upon oneself the role of a historiographer of acts undone, of a disciple of and commentator on ideas, works, and souls unborn . . .?this, I avow, requires great courage."39 Brzozowski himself proved a spirited if discomfiting critic-historian, relentless in his attempts to erase cultural errors, to raise national consciousness from its inertia by understanding history as dziejowosc, as man-made change. It is tempting to conclude that the absence of overruling historical necessity in his vision arose from an apprehension of an end to history, in the event of extinction of historically responsible, heroic agents. By the same token, Brzozowski's selfless anxiety for his nation's cultural condition?the impetus for his concern with history?may have carried a timely prognosis of approach ing catastrophe. We owe it to our historical understanding of that momentous period, the forces acting upon European society pending the world wars, to take a more comprehensive look at its intellectual heritage and its philosophical underpinnings.

In his 1999 preface to Man among Scorpions, Milosz draws a parallel between his own career and that of Brzozowski, the "wretch," the "?crivain maudit." Though maybe for different reasons, Milosz's attention was also drawn to the historical dimension of Brzozowski's writings: "I think that most important for me was his juxtaposition of the 'human' with the 'transhuman,' that is the juxtaposition of humanity as history with the mute regions of nature" (MS 6). 10 Walicki, Stanislaw Brzozowski, 7. 11 Granted, Brzozowski's express pro-Russianness was no invention: unlike most Poles living under Russian rule, he left undisguised his appreciation for Russian culture. He was well-versed in Russian literature and ideas, and kept up-to-date on Russian politics. 12 Brzozowski made also several novelistic attempts, though relatively unknown (pub lished posthumously): the youthful Pod cieiarem Boga [Under the Burden of God] (1901) and Wiry [Whirls], Plomienie: Zpapier?wpoMichaleKaniowskim [Flames: From the Papers of Micha!

Brzozowski, like G. W. F. Hegel, sees the object of historiosophy as an autonomous ontic domain. 17 Brzozowski's notion of dialectics is still largely Hegelian, yet his idea diverges from Hegel's dialectics precisely where it merges with Marx's, that is, in the movement from idealism to materialism. Admixed with this progressive dialectical understanding (the Viconian "recoursive" scheme absent) was Catholic eschatology: in the end, homo Jaber can only be redeemed through his own work. 18 Cezary Rowi?ski, Stanislawa Brzozowskiego "Legenda Mlodej Polski" na tie epoki [Stanislaw Brzozowski's The Legend of Young Poland against Its Historical Background] (Wroclaw: Wydawnictwo Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Zaklad Narodowy im.

Rowi?ski affords a plausible explanation of why Brzozowski never referred to and probably never read Edmund Husserl. He writes that, on the one hand, "[in Brzozowski's] opinion Cartesianism was once and for all overcome as a stage in the development of European thought" (Husserl continued where Ren? Descartes left off, albeit his notion of intentionality was a means of overcoming mind-body dualism), while on the other, "Brzozowski's intellectual horizon was limited by the problematic of modernism ... he did not, at bottom, overstep the frame of concerns vital to Young Poland" (157-58). While the latter may be true, the excesses of orthodox rationalism bearing on modernism were very much Brzozowski's concern. He opposed the prioritization of reason over will (to action) in science and other potentially productive areas. 21 Zdzisfaw Krasnodebski, Postmodernistyczne rozterki kultury [Postmodern Perplexities of Culture] (Warsaw: Oficyna Naukowa, 1996), 11. 22 I take whiggery to mean interpretation of the past as continuous and progressive in light of the present day, while presentism I take to be an interpretation of the past as noncontinuous, where the present can be more freely interpreted. Brzozowski, on the other hand, seems to interpret the present and past in light of a highly uncertain future. 23 Whereas the former narrative posits the present as the motivated aim and apogee of previous ages, the finale to a purposeful historical progression, the latter sees the present as an irreversible moment always determined by what preceded it in the natural regularity of cause and effect?both, in their own way, imbue history with necessity. 24 Insincerity toward the past reveals itself as a self-serving eclecticism, the collecting of dead types of existence. Brzozowski uses similar rhetoric when speaking of artistic escapism: "Here on this precipice that leads nowhere, one can sink into visions of buried worlds, and send to their dying land 'swans of longing,' but one must know the nature of that vision: only those prepared for and reconciled with death may see it" (L 505). 25 A "closed world" arises from hardline rationalism, finalism, teleology, or determinism (L230). 26 And to whom, ca. 1905, he dedicated a monograph. 27 Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life, trans.

Brzozowski's great appreciation of Nietzsche ended his romance with Darwinism and the scientific worldview.</page><page sequence="22">542 NEW LITERARY HISTORY In Legend alone Brzozowski refers to Nietzsche on a number of occasions; he recalls, for example, his acknowledgement of myth in intellectual formation (L2 142), and brings up what he nominally sees as an illusion of self-instantiation and differentiation of the individual from the rest of society as a unique creative prerogative. He admits the importance of difference ("not in that which makes men similar, but in what differentiates them in the countless new forms of life does collective force reside"), and values individualism, insofar as it benefits the production of collective energy (L2 394). His idealistic view of the individual posits the individual inextricably within the social sphere as its contributor. 28 I use Calinescu's distinction with respect to his own analysis: Five Faces, 311. 29 As famously discussed by E. D. Hirsch, Jr., in "Faulty Perspectives," in Modern Criticism and Theory: A Reader, ed.

The essay was originally printed in 1904, in Gazeta Polska (The Polish Gazette). 31 It is conceivably because of this that he does not use the "we"-form in his appeals. 32 Leszek Gawor, Katastrofizm w polskiej mysli spolecznej i filozoficznej, 1918-1939 [Catastrophism in Polish Social and Philosophical Thought, 1918-1939] (Lublin: Wyd. Uniw. Marii-Curie Sklodowskiej, 1999), 44 (hereafter cited in text). 33 For a discussion of ideogenetic types see L, 91-95. 34 The following passage may serve as elaboration: "The illusion arises that [the word] expresses something trans-existential, transhuman, distinct from and deeper than human coexistence. The word?the organ of human interaction over which it prevails; its content reveals itself as the basis for coexistence, independent of it, preceding it. The external world, constant complexes?whether we designate them as nature, God or matter? existing objectively, independent of coexistence, of the fluctuating stream of experience? all these are hypostases of concrete coordinations of human coexistence brought about by the involvement of speech" (L 98). In brief, they are forms of anthropomorphism proceeding from misidentification. 35 Georges Sorel's theory can be traced to Vico and Henri Bergson. 36 The Latin adjective legenda means "for reading, to be read," pertaining only to written stories, not to traditional ones transmitted orally. Also, an idealized tale set in a quasi imaginary past. A legend is, then, both something "for reading," such as the pseudoliterary fertility of moderna, and something "worth reading," which it is uncertain that the products of Polish modernism will become. WTiereas legends are rooted in popular history, myths are generally thought of as transcendental narratives. 37 Gianni Vattimo, "An Apology for Nihilism," in The End of Modernity: Nihilism and Hermeneutics in Postmodern Culture, trans.
