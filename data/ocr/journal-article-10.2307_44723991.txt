<plain_text><page sequence="1">741192 Simulation of Head Injury Due to Combined Rotation and Translation of the Brain Nabih M. Alem Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan THE HUMAN HEAD may be considered a physical system. Given such a system, simulation is resorted to in lieu of direct experimentation with the system itself. This is ob- viously necessary since experimentation with the system itself cannot exceed the tolerance of volunteers, and there- fore results of such experiments have limited values. Simu- lation implies conducting experiments on a model that is a simplified representation of the real system. Two approaches to mathematical modeling may be follow- ed; one resulting in a model of the head and the other in a model for head injury. The first one attempts to represent the physical and structural characteristics of the head and assumes that the structural similarities between model and head imply similarities between corresponding responses. The second model gives minor importance to the structural similarities and concerns itself primarily with the math- ematical reproduction of those responses that are critical to the prediction of an injury. The first type of model may thus be considered as structural and the second as function- al. If the two models are soundly formulated, they should then reach similar predictions of injury when they are sub- jected to similar loading or boundary conditions. The mathematical description of an actual human head must be based on great simplification of its material proper- ties as well as its geometrical structure. Most of the analytic- al models (1-6) were developed based on the similarity between the head and a spherical shell. In addition to this simplification, other idealizations in the material properties have been included in these models in order to obtain for- mulations which can be mathematically solved. Instead of reproducing the structural characteristics of the head, and later associating certain responses with the injury, many investigators emphasize the functional relationships between impact conditions and some indication of injury. * Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT This paper describes a mathematical model for head injury prediction based on the hypothesis that injury results from a combination of displacement and rotation of the brain inside the skull. The model is a 12-degrees-of-freedom mechanical system consisting of masses, dashpots, and springs. The classical Lagrange's method is used informulating the equations of motion. Numerical integration is used to obtain their solu- tion. Constants for the elements of the model are obtained from published experimental measurements. Other lumped parameters which have not yet been measured are deter- mined by adjusting them until a satisfactory agreement is obtained between the model's response and equivalent measured responses. The frequency and time responses of the model, for a variety of loading conditions, are studied. Results show a good agreement between experimentally observed and mathematically generated responses. Quantitative validation of some responses was prevented for the lack of experi- mental measurements. Nevertheless, the model provides a way of using multiple injury criteria to estimate the injury potential of severe impact environments. 3826</page><page sequence="2">A "Black-box" model transforms the input (impact) into an output (impact response) on which an injury criterion may be applied. The Wayne State Tolerance Curve (7,8) is essentially a functional model describing an input- (average g ) output (injury or noninjury) relationship. The Gadd Severity Index (GSI) (9) and the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) (10,1 1) are also functional relationships between an input (time history of acceleration) and an output (injury index). Other functional models, based more or less on some physical reality, have also been developed. These are lumped-parameter models with various degrees of lumpings and different bases for selection of parameters. These models accept acceleration as input and generate a physical response whose maximum is taken as an indication of im- pact severity. Currently, there are four of these models: J-Tole ranee Index (JTI) (12), Revised Brain Model (RBM) (13), and the Effective Displacement Index (EDI) (14), all based on a single-degree-of-freedom model, and the Maxi- mum Strain Criterion (MSC) (15), which is based on a two- degrees-of-freedom model. Another approach was taken by Roberts (16), who de- veloped a lumped-parameter model of the whole body in anterior-posterior (A-P) motion. The head was represented by a rigid sphere (skull) inside which a rigid mass (brain) is attached. This model is too general for localized study of head injury, since it simulates the motion of the body in addition to that of the head. All of the criteria and models have a limited range of application. When impact conditions change, so much the criteria of injury. The head injury model proposed in this paper satisfies two essential needs in the techniques used today for injury prediction. First, it is capable of simulating various possible head injury mechanisms, and second, it is flexible enough to accept a variety of impact loading condi- tions. INJURY MECHANISMS AND DESCRIPTION OF MODEL Most head injury hypotheses suggest that the motion of the brain inside the skull is of critical importance. This mo- tion is therefore given primary consideration in the pro- posed model. Skull deflection and its possible fracture is another possible mode of injury that is simulated. In addi- tion, the overall motion of the head about the first and second cervical vertebrae is simulated to give an indication of a possible neck injury. The anatomy of the head and neck is geometrically too complex to simulate in detail in a practical model. More or less gross approximations and idealizations must be made in order to achieve a practical model capable of simulating the desired injury mechanisms. Roughly speaking, the head consists of a brain surrounded by a skull, which is mounted on a neck. The characteristics of these elements (brain, skull, and neck) and their inter- connections as they relate to the injury mechanisms of con- cern may be lumped in a model consisting of rigid bodies, concentrated masses, and viscoelastic elements connecting them. Consequently, the model proposed here is a lumped- paràmeter one, where the parameters are obtained from the actual anatomy of the head, published and measured head responses, and, as necessary, actual measurements of these parameters. The actual human neck consists of seven cervical vertebrae joined by ligaments, fiber cartilages, and membranes to form a curved-beam column. The relative movements of the individual vertebrae are lumped in one single movement between the first and second vertebrae (atlas and epistroph- eus) and the seventh cervical one. Thus, the multielement curved neck is simulated by a single straight column. The bending characteristic of the neck itself is simulated by a torsional viscoelastic element at the cervial-thoracic articula- tion, and the compression-tension properties of the inter- vertebral ligaments and fibro cartilage s are represented by two translational viscoelastic elements along the axis of the simulated straight neck. Finally, the inertial properties of the neck are represented by a concentrated mass placed at the junction of the two translational elements. This mass is equal to that of the neck, and its location along the axis of the neck determines the moment of inertial property of the simulated neck. The submodel of the neck is shown in Fig. 1A. For the purposes of head injury simulation, the cerebral cranium, which consists of occipital, lateral, temporal, Fig. 1 - Elements of three submodels of proposed head injury model (A) NECK (B) SKULL (C) BRAIN d -w- t ι K3S Μ3 K4S ! ļ Ι C3S C4S ι K4 ^ &lt; Κ1Ν ! «τ*« ' L . /"-W"» C3ł « &lt;C1N ļ &gt;C2S 1 c" . i*- Ä ¡ ·« f -, 1 1 c" 1 Ä Q KIS ] CIS ^ K2N L / ^ CONCENTRATED MASS &gt; C2N f© J KTS ' &gt; [ Vex J CTS ) «'«'D RODY kv LEGEND' &lt; (VISCOELASTIC KELVIN ELEMENT /¿Λ KTN Ι -ν'Λ· ( (translational) VeX CTN ( (ř?L- (VISCOELASTIC KELVIN ELEMENT f ' vsT" I (torsional) 3827</page><page sequence="3">3828 NABIH M. ALEM spheroid, and ethmoid bones, may be considered as an en- closure housing the brain. The eight bones of the cerebral cranium and the visceral cranium are lumped into an en- closure shown in Fig. 1 B. This submodel simulates the skull and provides "walls" to which the brain can be attached. In addition, the inertial and viscoelastic properties of this enclosure represent similar characteristics of the actual skull itself. First, the two masses m^ and ιτ^ are connected by a Kelvin translational element and may be considered as the lateral walls of the skull. The third mass m 3 may be considered as the "roof' of the skull, and the mj-n^ axis as the "floor." The three masses are lumped so as to match impedance characteristics of the skull, and their distances are selected so as to give the skull submodel the same moment of inertia of the actual "rigid" skull. The four im- aginary surfaces formed by the three lumped masses of the skull are constrained by relatively stiff viscoelastic Kelvin elements, as shown in Fig. IB. The proposed model is a two-dimensional (planar) one. The actual movement of the skull relative to the neck is usually a combination of rolling, gliding, and rotation, which results in forward-backward pitching, left-right bending (or rolling), and left-right (L-R) twisting (or yawing). Since the model is planar, the yaw motion is not modeled, and only pitching and rolling are allowed for the A-P and L-R models, respectively. For the pitching motion of the skull, there is no precise axis of rotation because this motion is a mixed gliding and rolling of the two condyles of the occipital bones about the two articular pits of the atlas (first cervical vertebra). How- ever, the gliding is so small that it may be lumped with the rolling motion into a simple rotation about the lateral axis passing through the atlanto-occipital articulation. The cartilages, membranes, and muscles effecting the motion of ' φ"1η (S)&lt;TN) Fig. 2 - Assembled head injury model consisting of one rigid body, four concentrated masses, and ten translational and three torsional viscoelastic elements. Symbols in parentheses represent springs and dashpots in parallel this articulation are all lumped into a single torsional vis- coeleastic element. The rolling motion is also considered as a pure rotation, even though the mechanics of this L-R motion are not pre- cisely a simple rotation. When the skull "rolls" about the neck, the atlas remains almost fixed to the occipital con- dyles, and the skull-atlas combination rotates about a pair of lateral atlanto-epistrophic joints symmetrically situated on either side of the middle line. In the model, this motion is considered as a simple rotation about an A-P axis passing through a point halfway between the pair of lateral atlanto- epistorphic (first and second vertebrae) joints. The visco- elastic properties of cartilages, muscles, and ligaments are represented by a single torsional Kelvin element. Finally, the brain is simulated by a rigid body with mass and moment of inertia. The attachment of the brain to the skull is so designed as to allow three types of motion of the brain relative to the skull. Two translational Kelvin elements secure the brain to the two vertical walls of the skull and control the horizontal brain-skull motion. Two other visco- elastic elements attach the brain to the roof and the floor of the skull and control the vertical relative motion between the skull and the brain. The rotation of the brain inside the skull is controlled by a single torsional Kelvin element, which is grounded to an axis parallel to the m^-nr^ axis of the skull. The submodel of the brain and its attachments is shown in Fig. 1C. When the submodels of Fig. 1 are assembled, they form a model of the head which may be used to simulate the mo- tion of the brain, skull, and neck under impact conditions. This head-neck model (Fig. 2) is a two-dimensional one, and therefore would represent a planar motion in either the L-R or the A-P vertical planes. The constants of the model (values for masses, springs, dashpots, and distances) would then have to be different for an A-P impact from those for an L-R impact. This does not mean a change in the structure of the model, but a change in the values of the model's parameters. ALLOWED TYPES OF IMPACTS The proposed head injury model is designed to simulate injury mechanisms under impact conditions. The most common types of impacts are blows to the skull (direct im- pact) and sudden stops of the torso (indirect impact) ex- emplified by whiplash injuries. In order to keep the input to the model as simple as practicable, while providing enough flexibility of varying the impact conditions, the following forces, torques, and accelerations are allowed: 1 . Three forces Pļ , P2» anc^ P3 maY applied to the skull at mj , n^, and m^, respectively. The point of applica- tion of each force is at a distance (u, v) relative to its cor- responding mass, and its direction is denoted by an angle a from the horizontal axis of the skull. 2. A torque Ts may be applied to the enclosure formed</page><page sequence="4">SIMULATION OF HEAD INJURY 3 829 by m j , 1TI2, and that is, the torque acts on the skull as a rigid body. 3. A torque Tn may be applied to the neck, usually at the neck-torso joint, but could be interpreted to act on the angle of the neck. 4. At the neck-torso articulation, chosen as the inter- vertebral joint between the seventh cervical and first thor- acic vertebrae, two types of inputs are allowed. Either vertical and horizontal motions are specified. The rationale behind specifying the motion of this point is the difficulty of obtaining experimental measurements of the forces act- ing at this joint and the relative ease of obtaining its time- history motion. The external loading forces, torques, and acceleration input to the model are shown in Fig. 3. AVAILABLE EXPERIMENTAL DATA Because of wide variations in the biological properties and observed responses between various human heads, it is difficult to ascertain the statistical value of the measured properties. This is further compounded by the limitations in obtaining human responses to impact beyond voluntary tolerance levels. It seems, therefore, that no set of constants obtained from these data can result in a single model which can be matched by an actual human head. However, the selection of constants can be made from ranges or bands of acceptable experimental data, bearing in mind that, while the resulting model may not duplicate a human head, it can serve effectively to show trends in responses and patterns of injury mechanisms under varying impact conditions. p»/ A * p»/ / V" y'v / ~ V" ' v y'v 'V / Xk. ~ ' ^ v y'v 'V 'Λ--' ' ^ ' t • Fig. 3 - External forces and torques which may be applied to model.

Given a set of constants describing the model, it should be pointed out that the choice of the constants is based on ex- perimental data recorded under specific impact conditions. It has been shown that when these conditions change, it is very likely that the corresponding responses also change. This justifies the need for idfferent models to be used for different impacts. Thus, an A-P model should not be used for side impacts; instead, an L-R model must be used for these impacts. Such separation is perfectly acceptable since the model is conceived for short-duration impacts, during which the initial motions are essentially planar. Most of the anatomical properties of human and Rhesus heads have been measured and published. These are proper- ties relevant to the model and include such inertial proper- ties as average head weights, average brain weights, and move- ments of inertia of the head about various axes. Dimensions of the skull and neck have also been measured; however, data on the locations of the skull e.g., brain e.g., and distance be- tween neck-skull articulation to skull e.g. are rare in the liter- ature. This may attributed to the uncertainty about the precise axis of rotation of the skull about the atlas, and possi- bly to the difficulty of pinpointing the exact location of the skull e.g. relative to some well-known bone "landmark." Modelers had to assume reasonable values for these distances. Therefore, in addition to actual measurements, assumed values, which have been used in similar models, are used in the present model as initial estimates of many of its param- eters. The geometrical and inertial properties of the head are only partial requirements to describe the model. Other in- formation is needed about the dynamic behavior of the head. Such information is usually available in the form of load- deflection curves under quasi-static or dynamic loading, natural motion of the brain inside the skull, steady -state response of the head to forced vibrations given in the form of impedance-frequency curves, and occasionally impact- response of the head given as acceleration-time histories.

ALEM information is contained implicitly in these curves. Typical available data are given in Figs. 4-7, along with their sources. Several observations should be made at this point about the experimental data. First, the spread in most of reported data is wide, which decreases the confidence in the validity of any selected set of constants. Second, many of the "constants" of the model are neither constant nor linear. This is not uncommon in modeling situations where idealiza- tions and simplifying assumptions are usually made in order to develop a simple and practical model. However, some elements, critical to the performance of the model, have been so designed that they may be described by nonlinear, piecewise load-deflection curves (Fig. 8). Third, it should be pointed out that in a discrete-element model, many of the elements are conceptual and do not physically exist. By the virtue of "creating" these elements, the problem of assign- ing properties to them always arises. Some arbitrary, but reasonable, values must be chosen. This choice may later be adjusted during the validation phase of model development. 7- 9 i:: / l·· IM / /X IM /X Č 3- ytT IM / û y 2 - &gt;/ y o υ L 1 » I I o υ L 1000 2000 FORCE (N) Fig. 5 - Static load-deflection curve of human skull in A-P direction (18).

Solid curve is used in model and initially divided equally between two torsional springs at each end of neck submodel FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF MODEL The impedance-frequency curve of a mechanical system is an implicit description of most of its elements. The driving- point impedance is one of the mechanical properties which have been extensively measured on human cadaver heads and on various primates' heads. The same property may be obtained for the model by using the generalized technique developed by the author for a linear mechanical network. For illustration purposes, the driving-point impedance of the model of a human head in the A-P direction is compared in Fig. 9 with actual measured impedances of two cadaver heads. The immediate, but not surprising, observation is that the impedance-frequency curve of the model depends, indeed, on the values assigned to the various constants. An important implication is that these constants can be tuned- as finely as desired, but within the limitations of the model- to match the measured impedance of a real head.

However, the maximum number of resonances that can be generated by the model is three, which corresponds to the three natural frequencies of the horizontal model. One of these frequen- cies is very low (3-5 Hz) and does not appear on most of the measured impedance curves. This frequency is attributed to the motion of the brain (heavy mass) inside the skull (soft coupling springs). It is interesting to note that not all the elements of the model have significant effects on the generated impedance curve. As might have been expected, the further an element gets away from the driven point, the less effect it has on the frequency response of the driving-point impedance. In general, stiffer springs tend to shift the midportion of the curve to the right (higher frequency), and heavy damp- ings tend to round off the peaks of the curve (lower anti- resonance and higher resonance). Masses have various effects, but they basically shift the curve upward when their values are increased. TIME RESPONSES OF THE MODEL The immediate result of the present study is the generation of a time response of the proposed model by numerically solving the equations of motion. This initial result has both academic and practical values. The academic value lies in the methods used to obtain a solution to a complex mechanical system. More important are the practical applications of the model, where the solution plays an essential role. In order to demonstrate the use of the model in simulating impact situations, only one case is presented here. It is a sim- ulation of a direct side impact to the skull, performed on a Rhesus L-R model. This simulation is based on one of a series of side impact tests conducted by Stalnaker (21). This test (RH-70-22) is selected because the measurements and data obtained were as complete as possible. ι I I I I 1 1 1 1 1000- 1 500 - / ' I o L - i - - - - -500 - 'y l·5™ &gt;1 TIME Fig. 10 - Absolute angular velocity of skull -I - I - I I I 1 1 I 1 40 - Í ' g 20- / ' ^ &gt; ' -20 - ' I 1 1 I h 5m&gt; *| TIME Fig. 1 1 - Absolute angular velocity of brain Reportedly, the impact force, which is almost triangular in shape, had a duration of 3.5 ms and a peak of 9100 N. This resulted in a maximum head acceleration of 940 g, a maxi- mum head angular acceleration of 75000 rad/s^, and a maxi- mum angular velocity of 180 rad/s. The injury was reported just at the threshold of survival (index 3 on a scale of 1 to 5), with no skull fractures or loss of consciousness. The purpose of this simulation is to compare the results of the model to the experimental result. The biggest problem in re-creating the impact conditions is the description of the forces (or accelerations) at the bottom of the neck, which were not measured during the experimental test. Therefore, some reasonable boundary conditions must be assumed in order to run the model. Consider the experimental results of test RH-70-22. These show that peak recorded forces and accelerations are reached within 3 ms from the beginning of the impact. Examination of the high-speed film of the event shows that the torso, be- cause of its large inertia, remains almost stationary while the head moves, and the peaks are reached during the initial period of 3 ms. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the accelerations of the neck-torso pivot are zero, at least during the first few critical milliseconds. Furthermore, forces acting on this point are not zero, but must "balance" the impact</page><page sequence="7">3832 NABIH M.

This leads to the conclusion that, insofar as the initial period of the simulation is concerned, the boundary condi- tions at the neck-torso point are zero accelerations. Only some of the results of the simulation are shown in graphic forms in Figs. 10-21. Based on these results, the following comments may be made. 1 . The skull and brain angular velocities, shown in Figs. 10 and 1 1 , show that the skull reaches a substantially higher peak angular velocity than the brain. In the actual test, the reported experimental head angular velocity of 180 rad/s is much lower than the simulated 950 rad/s of the skull. 2. The reported maximum head acceleration for test RH- 70-22 is 940 g. The simulation shows a maximum of 780 g for the skull and 950 g for the brain (Figs. 12 and 13). Here, there seems to be an agreement between the results of the simulation and the actual test. 3. Angular accelerations have been the center of much of the attention in head injury assessment. The simulation pre- dicts (Figs. 14 and 15) that the skull would reach a peak 550,000 rad/s angular acceleration, while the brain reaches a peak 18,500 rad/s2. In the actual test RH-70-22, it is re- ported that the head angular acceleration reaches a peak of 75,000 rad/s2. - I - I I I I' 1 1 1 1 ' - "1 5*105-/' Z ' « I / ^ Ul 1 / UJ I I *-5* IO5- ļ / μ 5m&gt; »I TIME Fig. 14 - Angular acceleration of skull I ! ι III 1 » I 1 20X103 - ί ι ' ~ 10x10' - I ' Ζ I 1 O / I 5 * 7 /1 ' * /1 UJ ^ J I -10x10' ■ V/ v ι ι ι ι ι v * ■ ' ι I· 5m$ -I TIME Fig. 15 - Angular acceleration of brain - ι - I - ι - ι - ι 1 1 1 1 9 - 8 - 7 - UJ 5- / ' pLn ι ι ι ι ι 1 1 1 |, 5 m» rļ TIME Fig. 1 6 - Translation of brain relative to skull, measured as change of distance between their centers of mass 4.

This implies that the present model may be used as a substitute for the MSC model, since it offers, in addition to the maximum strain, other variables that could be used as criteria for injury under a variety of impact conditions. 6. In a direct impact test, some of the variables that might offer a clue to head injury tolerance are the forces and moment at the occipital condyles, simulated in the present model by the skull-neck pivot point. Figs. 19-21 show the moment, axial, and shear forces acting on this joint. These are typical variables that are difficult to measure experi- mentally, but they can easily be obtained in the simulation. The peaks are approximately 350 N-m for the moment, 6230 Ν for the axial force, and 4900 Ν for the shear force. While there are no experimental records to compare against these results, these values are not unreasonable, considering the 8900 Ν force applied as input. The irregular behavior of these three curves is a result of two facts. First, the head is attach- ed to a neck that oscillates such that its acceleration (neck- torso pivot) is zero. Second, the neck-skull pivot is character- ized by the model by nonlinear springs. However, it could be safely assumed that the responses in the initial period (two or three times the duration of the impact pulse) are reliable, at</page><page sequence="9">3834 NABIH M. ALEM least as far as most of the experimentally available results show. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The analytical model developed in this study responds to a variety of impact loading conditions and produces a variety of responses. Simpler models do not provide the versatility that this current model does. Some of the difficulties encountered were the determina- tion of mechanical characteristics of the various elements of the model. Most were overcome by reasonable assumptions based on the available experimental measurements. Results show that the model response shows a qualitative agreement with the measured responses of human and Rhesus heads, but the detailed response of the model cannot be validated unless more measurements, specifically oriented to this end, are made. The experimental data used to obtain constants for the model are the result of years of research and experimentation by many individuals and institutions. The fact that most of the data cannot directly result in the desired constants of the model shows that more experiments should be conducted to measure specifically the parameters required by this model. The difficulty of measuring the motion of the brain in vivo, for example, may be surmounted by designing an experiment- al setup that can, in fact, monitor this motion. The model provides a basis for conducting these experiments and, when more reliable data become available, may be used for actual simulations of the head. As it is now, the model can only be used to study the effects of the physical parameters of im- pact on head injury and to draw some general conclusions about it. While a major hurdle has been passed by developing this model, further research must follow it, by using it both as a guide in experimental head injury and as a tool in devel- oping injury criteria. It is suggested that: 1 . The motion of the brain be accurately observed during forced and impact vibrations. The state-of-the-art in radio- cinematography is now capable of observing and recording the motion of the brain under these conditions. 2. Torsional forced-vibration tests should be conducted on the head in order to obtain a more reliable experimental basis for determining the brain-skull torsional coupling. 3. Extensive parametric studies of the model should be conducted in order to tune the model and to isolate critical variables that could be used as criteria for injury. 4. Full-size whiplash and direct impact tests must be con- ducted, and variables must be recorded in the light of the detailed responses generated by the model.
