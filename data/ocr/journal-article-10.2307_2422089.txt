Schuster Department of Botany, University of Minnesota, Minneapolisf Introduction The Hepaticae, or Liverworts, as they are popularly called, include moss- like plants that differ from the "true?' mosses in a number of ways (see pp. 283), but most obviously in that they are more or less strongly flattened and dorsiventral (i.e., expanded in a horizontal plane). The amateur can profitably study the Hepaticae because his local studies often can conitribute materially to what is known about the group. It is in the hope of makilng study of a difficult group easier for the non-specialist that this manual has been written. For this reason many illustrations are substi- tuted for extensive descriptions, since it has been found through experience that one good figure is better than a page of description.T The numerous figures are integrated as much as possible, with the keys, text, and glossary. For the student who wants to advance to more technical works after exhausting the aid this work offers, the writer recommends the following: * Because of length, the present work will be published in two parts. The present part carries the information through the taxonomic section. The final part will include the sections on ecology anid phytogeography. f Present address: University of Mississippi, University, Miss. : Furthermore, the keys can be read backward to obtain a description of the more salient structural features. For instance the following description of Lophozia (Ortho- caulis) kunzeanus emerges from the keys: Leaves mostly bilobed (a few trilobed); sinus descending 1/3 - 1/2 the leaf-length; underleaves small, with 0-3 cilia; ventral leaf-base mostly lacking cilia; gemmae occurring rarely, and present at the apices of normal leaves occurring on normal shoots; leaves sub- transverse, slightly succuLbous, with acute sinuses; cells of leaf-middle 14-24 A; plants erect or suberect in growth; perianth plicate, lacking a beak; leaves symmetrical or nearly so, the lobes subequal. Stern with homogeneous medulla; oil-bodies as in Dilophozia. Leaves distinctly succubously inserted . . . never concave-canaliculate (p. 314). Together with the discussion of differentiation of the species, such a description gener- ally should suffice for its identification. 257</page><page sequence="2">258 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) The Student's Handbook of British Hepdtics by S.

It is a large, fully illustrated work of importance to the research worker for its critical treatment.* The North American Flora (Vol. 14, Pt. I). This portion of the work covers the Sphaerocarpales and Marchantiales, but does not treat the much larger group of leafy forms, nor the Anthocerotales. It has been prepared by able specialists (C. C.

This work, started in 1937, was finished in 1947. It is a useful compilation, largely the work of Miuller, Evans, Macvicar, Howe, and Buch, and of that in The North American Flora. It unfortunately lacks the useful discussions of Macvicar's work and is of limited usefulness because of occasionally poor keys (and their absence in some difficult groups where they are especially needed), frequent errors, and the nature of the illustrations (generally redrawings, on a smaller scale, of illustrations used by Muller, Macvicar, or other students). If a supplementary paper with corrections were published, the usefulness of the work would be much increased. The work also lacks detailed data on ecology and distribution.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The writer hereby acknowledges the interest and support given by Dr. E. C. Abbe in the initiation and preparation of this handbook; the support of Dr. A. 0. Dahl in the completion of the work; and the help given by Dr. E. C. Abbe and Dr. C. 0. Rosen- dahl in finding interesting and fruitful collecting places. The writer is also indebted to the Graduate School of the University of Minnesota, which provided funds for part of the work and also to the Hayden Fund of the University of Minnesota, which provided a subsidy toward publication. Finally, the writer would like to express his gratitude to his wife, Olga M. Schuster, who helped on countless occasions, both in the field and in the final reading of this manuscript. The writer also acknowledges the painstaking and conscien- tious help of Miss Wilma Monserud in the assembly of the plates and insertions of figure- numbers and symbols. Most of the figures were drawn by the writer. Several, however, were drawn by Miss Monserud, under the direction of the writer and bear the initials WM. A very few figures are redrawn from the publications of K. Muller and of A. W. Evans; these are acknowledged in their proper place. Some of the writer's illustrations previously appeared in The American Midland' Naturalist, and are used again through the courtesy of Dr. John D. Mizelle, editor of this journal. Collection, Study and Preservationi of Materials Collection.-For the purposes of the general student, the methods em- ployed in Hepaticology are very simple. In general, for field work one needs a good doublet or triplet lens, of about 10-15 x, with a field at least 10 mm (preferably more) wide, as well as a large, rather sharp knife. Take the material collected with as little substrate as possible, and place each collec- tion in an envelope or a small paper bag (one pound brown paper sacks are useful and inexpensive). Write the pertinent data on the bag, such as: Type of habitat: rock faces or crevices, bark, logs, or humus; in a swamp, a ravine, a bog, etc. Type of Forest: density; coniferous or deciduous, etc. Type of rock substrate (igneous or sedimentary, calcareous or acid). Date and collector. Exact locality data. Moisture and shade conditions. On longer trips, this data may be much condensed for individual collec- tions, and collections from the same type of habitat placed in a larger bag, or small corrugated box, with full data written on it. When paper bags are unavailable wrap each collection from the same type of site in newspaper, and place all specimens in a box or large paper sack with the pertinent data written on it. Study.-Material collected in this manner may be treated in one of two</page><page sequence="4">260 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) ways: 1) Allow to dry and work over at leisure (many professional workers do not work on material collected in summer until the following fall and winter). This treatment is satisfactory if the material is sufficiently separated to admit air, so that it will not decay and mold before drying, or, 2) Take back while fresh and work over in the laboratory or at home. If the material is dried first, soak it in warm water, drain until just moist, and examine under the lens, or, preferably, with a low power binocular micro- scope. Smaller species (and individual shoots of larger species) are advan- tageously studied if placed in water (or water with a little glycerine added to prevent too rapid drving), in a watch-glass or a petri dish. Material growing on soil often must be washed, preferably under cold or lukewarm tap-water, until free of sand particles. Alternatively, the material may be kneaded softly while in petri dishes until the soil is removed. It may then be transferred to a clean dish of water. When the material is studied with the binocular microscope, or hand lens, only a limited knowledge (often insufficient for definite identification) can be gained of the species:* in leafy forms the type of leaf and its insertion, the shape of the perianth, the size and nature of underleaves, etc. can be ascer- tained (unless very minute), but in thallose forms the size and nature of the ventral scales and tlle shape of the archegoniophores and antheridiophores are almost all that can be determined. For critical study, examine individual plants of the smaller species mounted on a slide and under a coverslip (in water or water with added glycerine) with the low power of a compound microscope. In the case of the larger thallose species, dissect the ventral scales and mount on a slide. Strip off the dorsal epidermis and examine microscopically. In the case of leafy forms, part of a leaf often may be enough to give a clue to its identity. The leaf cells should be studied: their size and the nature of the walls are often critical characters that must be ascer- tained (these usually necessitate use of high dry power, or even of oil-immer- sion lenses), while the oil-bodies must also sometimes be studied for absolute determination.t For the dissection and sectioning of materiaI very few tools are needed: 1. Very fine needles mounted with sealing wax in glass tubes. 2. Small scalpels, made most easily as follows: Take a new razor blade and break off a narrow, acutely tapering splinter, using a pair of long-nose pliers. Mount the broad end of this sliver in the end of a piece of narrow-diameter glass tubing with sealing wax. * Popular works often stress the fact that mosses and hepatics can be easily studied "with a hand lens." This is an unfortunate misconception because, while a few large species, such as Ptilidium, 7Trichocolea, and Bazzania trilobata, can be identified without a microscope, the others almost always have to be recognized first by intensive microscopic study, after which they can be recognized in the field with a hand lens, or even with the naked eye. It is only after the species are well known through study under the micro- scope that a field knowledge can be attained, and even then, for the sake of accuracy, the material should be checked again with the microscope. t The oil-bodies disintegrate after the plant has been dried for some time (the time interval being a variable dependent on the species, the method of drying, and other factors). In material dried for less than two years at least the younger leaves often show some oil-bodies. Never mount plants to be examined for oil-bodies in glycerine and water, since the glycerine almost invariably causes the swift disintegration of the oil-bodies.</page><page sequence="5">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 261 3. Good razor blades. 4. Elder pith (a fresh piece of raw carrot makes a good substitute). For sectioning the stems of leafy species or thalli of thallose forms, insert a piece of plant in a cut' in the pith (which has been saturated by soaking in 701%o alcohol), and make thin sections with a razor blade. Mount these sec- tions on a slide in water or water and glycerine, and then observe. Dry material of thallose forms often recovers little of its turgidity when soaked in water, but usually regains its form when soaked in lactic acid or lactophenol. Preservation of Dissections.-It is often advantageous to preserve perma- nently dissections of plants, or of spores, etc. Such dissections need only to be placed on a slide in a little molten glycerine jelly, arranged while the slide is still warm, and covered with a cover slip.* To make them fairly permanent, the cover slip should be ringed with a good ringing cement or thin Canada balsam. It is quite possible, by using large cover slips and smalt pieces of broken cover slip (or thick celluloid, etc.) as "props" on the corners of slides, to make preparations of entire plants of even the larger leafy forms. Some, prepared by the writer nearly ten years ago, are still in such good condition that the cells can be studied with oil-immersion. It is important to avoid using too much jelly (or to carefully wash away the excess with a small brush after the slide has set), and to ring the slide carefully so that it is air tight. A little practice and ingenuity are all that is needed. Making a Collection.-Preservation of collected materials entails very little difficulty. In general, material studied and identified as above, while fresh or after being soaked in water, is allowed to dry under very gentle pressure (in order to ensure a less bulky specimen and at the same time prevent so mucl compression that the material, on being soaked again, will not regain its normal form). It is advantageous to remove as much as possible of the sub- strate, in order to get specimens that are quite thin (1/16 -1/4"). These small moss-mats are placed in envelopes, on which are written the collection data and the name. If much material is collected, a printed label carrying as much as possible of the data, is advantageous. A good size for such a label is 3"x5". The type used by the writer is illustrated on p. 262. Such labels preferably are glued on the front flap of the envelope or "packet." The writer uses 4" x 6"' packets; another good size is 3" by 5". Either size can be filed conveniently in a card file. In many large herbaria the packets are glued on herbarium sheets, which are placed in folders in large drawers. This practice has little to recommend it, and is used, chiefly by people more interested in higher plants, in an attempt to introduce uniformity * The more delicate species frequently show a disturbing amount of shrinkage when transferred directly from water to glycerine jelly. In such cases, the writer recommends the following procedure: 1) Cover the dissection (mounted in water) with a cover-slip. 2) Introduce a small drop of glycerine at edge of cover-slip and allow to diffuse through the water-mount. 3) Allow to stand for 12-48 hours, until most of the water has evap- orated and glycerine has become concentrated. 4) Place small mass of glycerine jelly at edge of slide, heat, and allow to diffuse through the preparation.</page><page sequence="6">262 THE AMERICAN MVIIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) into a herbarium. The amateur will find that filing packets alphabetically by genera, or by families, in a card file or in boxes of card-file size, will facilitate access and shifting of material. Although some workers use ordinary stationer's envelopes, it is quite simple to make "packets" by folding heavy paper of good quality. The following is one of a number of procedures used: Take a sheet of 81/V x 11" bond paper (preferably a heavy weight paper, of at least 24 lb. weight), and place on it a 4 x 6" file card (indicated by the cross-hatched area in Fig. 2) 4" above the bottom margin of the paper. Fold up (over the file card) the bottom 4 inches, of the paper, as in Fig. 2. Fold in the margins of the sheet over the sides of the file-card (as in Fig. 3), giving about a 1?4" flap on each side. Fold down the upper margin of the paper (the upper 3Y2", as in Fig. 4). HEPATICAE OF MINNESOTA Collected by R. M. Schuster No. 14330 May 31,1949 Reboulia hemisphaerica (Le.)

(pH 7.9) Occurring with: carpocephala Fig. 1.-Sample label used for herbarium specimens The label made (in this manner) can be glued on the flap of this enve- lope. Another alternative is to have the data shown on the specimen label printed, or mimeographed, directly on the packet (preferably boxed in a rec- tangle about the size of the label). In the latter case, the additional data can be either written (or typed) directly on the packet. In "packeting;" specimens it should be kept in mind that often rare species are found in admixture, with occasionally only a few stems of the desired plant occurring. In such cases, it is often desirable to pull out several (or most) of the individual plants of that species and wrap them in small, indi- vidual packets made of lens-tissue or other soft, absorbent tissue as "Kleenex." In this way, individual plants of a very rare species can be isolated. The same can be done for fertile plants of a species, when only a few of these occur in a mat, and when these should be singled out.</page><page sequence="7">.1953 SCHUSTER: BOREEAL HEPATICAE 263 The Life History, Structure and Position of Hepaticae and Their Classification LIFE HISTORY In order that the reader may understand the structure of the Liverworts, it seems necessary to briefly review the life cycle, the terms applied to the various stages, and their terminology. The typical life cycle of a leafy liverwort is illustrated in Fig. 3. It can be seen here that the green plant, or dominant generation (called the haploid generation, or gametophyte), bears sexual organs (antheridia, producing an- therozoids that, when there is present a film of water, actively swim to the archegonia, each of which produces a single egg-cell); this may be schematical- ly represented by Fig. 3:1. Upon fertilization of the elgg-cell, which is con- tained in a flask-shaped archegonium (Fig. 3:1), there is a combination of the nuclei of the sperm and of the egg-cell; this results in a zygote (Fig. 3:2), which normally has twice as many chromosomes as either egg or sperm. For that reason, the generation that results from this zygote is called the diploid generation, or sporophyte. In Fig. 3:2-7, the development of this sporophyte generation is shown diagramatically. The sporophyte generation is distin- guished from the gametophyte by stippling. The development of the diploid generation, or sporophyte, takes place within the archegonium of the parent (gametophyte) generation. As the zygote undergoes progressive division (Fig. 3:3-6), the archegonial venter, or lower swollen portions of the archegonium, becomes gradually larger, to accom- 31L -------- ' ' ,,, , 4 6" : 3 Fig. 2.

As the sporophyte grows, it differentiates into three regions, the basal foot (f), the seta (s), and a terminal sporangium (sp); the foot grows, to a greater or lesser extent, into the stem tissue of the gametophyte parent (Fig. 3:6-7). At maturity, the stalk, or seta of the sporophyte generally suddenly elongates, bursting through the calyptra, elevating the sporangium far above the level of the gametophyte to which it is still attached (Fig. 3:7); when this process is completed, the sporangium ruptures, often into four valves (Fig. 3:7), releasing the contents of the sporangium. The cells within the sporangium, while this process of increase in size has taken place, have undergone a peculiar type of development. All (or most) of these cells within the sporangium, or capsule, round off from their neighbors, and divide by two successive divisions to give a cluster (tetrad or quartet) of spores. These two successive divisions always result in a reduc- tion in chromosome number, specifically in a halving of the chromosome num- ber, and are therefore collectively called reduction division, or meiosis.

Among these may be certain elongate cells, which generally function to loosen up the spore mass, when the capsule opens, or to effectively propel the spores out and away from the capsule (or both); these cells are the elaters. After being propelled away from the capsule (by the elaters, by wind, or by water-or by several of these means in combination), the spores may land on a favorable substrate. Should this happen, the spore will generally swell somewhat and burst, upon which the cell within will send out a slender tube, the germination-tube (Fig. 3:8), which soon becomes septate, or divides into daughter cells. This process of growth and cell-division gradually goes on to give a more or less brief filamentous, green stage, the protonema (Fig. 3:9), from which eventually develops a new, juvenile plant (Fig. 3:10). By a process of further growth and differentiation, this grows eventually into a new plant, or gametophyte, which again develops sex organs (and again initiates a new cycle). It should be noted that the haploid generation (gametophyte) is green, manufactures its own food, and is totally free-living. On the other hand, the sporoplhyte (diploid) generation, by virtue of the fact that fertilization occurs within the tissues of the gametophyte, is of necessity dependent on the gameto- phyte generation, at least while it undergoes its early development. Biologists today generally concede that this dependency of the sporophyte, or parasitism on the gametophyte, is a specialized feature, the "opportunity" for whose origin must implicitly have been present because of the type and place of ferti- lization. The evolutionary position of the Hepaticae is a very direct conse- quence of the biological interrelationships between these two generations. This topic is of such interest it may well be taken up in more detail in the following section. POSITION OF HEPATICAE IN THE PLANT KINGDOM The Hepaticae agree with the lower vascular plants and the mosses in that they possess multicellular archegonia and antheridia surrounded by a "sterile jacket layer" of cells, and in that, primitively, they have a distinctly radially symmetrical sporophyte (or asexually reproducing) generation. All such forms are classed together as the Archegoniates, in contrast to the lower "Thallophytes." Unlike the higher land plants, such as Ferns, Horsetails, Conifers, and Flowering Plants (i.e., the "vascular" plants), the Hepaticae (and the related mosses) have no trace of a true vascular system. For this reason mosses and Hepaticae are placed together in a major division, or phylum, the Bryophyta. The Bryophyta probably constitutes an artificial group, because it includes a variety of distinct dtvelopmental lines, each of which differs from the vascular plants in that the asexually reproducing sporophyte has become more or less dependent (or parasitic) on the gametophyte, and is attached to it through. out its life. It is obviously impossible for the sporophyte to attain a much larger size than the sexually reproducing stage (gametophyte). In the Hepat- icae (and mosses), therefore, the gametophyte is the prominent generation or</page><page sequence="10">266 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) "plant," in contrast to the higher plants, in which the sporophyte is not de- pendent (except sometimes in its immature stages) on the gametophyte, and eventually becomes free from it. The sporophyte, in the higher plants (or Tracheophytes), thus can, and does, grow to a much larger size than the gametophyte, thus becoming the dominant generation (what we commonly consider the "plant"). It is chiefly in the predominance of the gametophyte generation that the Liverworts (and mosses) differ from the higher plants. Because their sporophytes are so small, the Liverworts either have never devel- oped, or have lost, the vascular tissue. Because the gametophyte must be covered with a film of water at the time of discharge of the antherozoids ("sperms"), the gametophyte can grow in general only slightly higher than the surface of the soil: hence the "'plants"' of the Hepaticae (and mosses) are of necessity limited in size. Therefore, except in the Arctic regions,* they always play a very subsidiary role in the vegetation, compared to the higher plants. The fact that the sporophyte (which is dependent on the gametophyte) and the gametophyte (which must at times be covered with a film of water) are limited in size, arid the fact that selection continually tends to eliminate the larger forms rising higher above the ground, have been the major factors in limiting the development of the Bryophyta. To all effects, because the Hepaticae and mosses have gone astray in a blind alley leading to virtual oblivion, it is impossible for them to attain the high state of development, large size, and dominant position that the Tracheophytes, in which the sporo- phyte never becomes "parasitic" on the gametophyte, have attained. It therefore seems, to the present writer at least, rather difficult to attempt to maintain the largely discredited notion that the Bryophytes "led"t to the higher plants. A group that has become lost in such a cul de sac and has been "driven" to the most inhlospitable and unfavorable environments is certainly scarcely one from which anything could be derived. In respect to derivation, it would be more sensible, in many ways, to say that the Bryophytes developed from forms near the Psilophytales (a generalized group that had not, obvious- ly, lost all opportunity for evolution towards higher, more complex types). For this reason the entire viewpoint of reduction as the major evolutionary tendency has been accepted for the Bryophytes. With the realization that the Bryophytes "made the mistake" of attaining "security" of the sporophyte generation at the expense of all possibility of evolution toward higher types, it seems scarcely possible to hypothesize successfully that there has been pro- gressive evolution in the Bryophyta. This can be expressed in another way: when size and complexity of the sporophyte are "sacrificed" in order to attain a greater "security" (by making the sporophyte parasitic on the gametophyte), the one stage of the life cycle * Climatic conditions are such in the Arctic that the larger vascular plants cannot attain any degree of dominance. Hence, Bryophytes and Lichens form the bulk of the vegetation in much of the treeless Tundra. t The teleological and anthropomorphic mode of expression in this and the succeeding paragraphs is used advisedly for the sake of ease of expression, and for the sake of brevity.</page><page sequence="11">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 267 that is potentially able to rise more than a few inches above a substrate continu- ally free of water is no longer able to do so, and is completely "shackled" by the inadequacy of the gametophyte for a terrestrial existence. In brief, one can scarcely expect a group that has so unsatisfactorily resolved the problem of the "inadequacy" of the gametophyte for a terrestrial existence to "lead" to anything else. A group so firnly "committed" to reduc- tion of the sporophyte generation cannot well be considered to have "led" to groups in which the opposite tendency (sporophyte elaboration correlated with gametophyte elimination) prevails. This seems quite impossible, since environ- mental pressure clearly would constantly be effective in tending to reduce the gametophyte (and consequently the attached sporophyte). Therefore the concept of evolution from a Riccia-like type with a reduced sporophyte to an Anthoceros-like type with a complex sporophyte can scarcely be maintained.* A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF STRUCTURE OF THE HEPATICAE In order to identify liverworts, one must have some understanding of the structure or morphology of various types. The present account does not go into any more detaii than is needed for a complete understanding of the keys to families, genera, and species. THE GAMETOPHYTE (or "Plant") In the preceding section on life cycle, it was stated that the "plant" or dominant "generation" is the gametophyte. Since this stage is the one usually found, it has been common practice to use variations in its structure for the erection of families, genera, and species. This, for the sake of convenience, is desirable, since it allows one to determine "sterile" material (i.e., material lacking sporophytes and associated organs developed for their protection by the gametophyte). Therefore the structure of the gametophyte will be de- scribed in greater detail. There are, in the liverworts (unlike in the mosses, which are all leafy), two fundamentally distinct types of plant body, which are connected by inter- mediate types: A. The erect, radially symmetrical leafy type, exemplified by such genera as Haplomitrium; similar to the typical moss. Because this form of plant body does not occur in our region, it is possible at once to separate the Hepati- cae from most mosses.t This type is therefore not discussed further here. B. The flattened or dorsiventral type. All our Hepaticae are various modifications of this type. For convenience, this structural type is divided into two further groups: * The retention of vestigial stomata on the undersurface of the gametophyte of certain species of Anthoceros, the large size and indefinite growth, and nutritional inde- pendence of the sporophyte generation (as well as its functional stomates) all argue that Anthoceros is less reduced (hence more primitive) than Riccia-like types. The occurrence of stomates on the underside of the thallus can only be interpreted as vestigial structures, not structures in-process-of evolution. Hence Anthoceros probably evolved from an extinct, even more complex ancestor. t Unfortunately a few mosses also have become flattened.</page><page sequence="12">268 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) The leafy, or foliose type, treated in detail immediately below. The thalloid, or frondose type, discussed beginning p. 278. THE LEAFY OR FOLIOSE TYPE Because most of our iocal species, and about 80-90% of the species of the world, belong to this type it is discussed more fully than the thallose. The leafy type consists essentially of an axis or stem, 'bearing a series of lateral leaves (called simply "leaves") on each side, and usually a third row of smaller ventral leaves, called underleaves or amphigastria. The ventral or postical side of the stem bears, in addition, unicellular, hair-like structures called rhizoids. UNDERLEAVES The form, size, and presence or absence of the underleaves are important in identification of Hepaticae. In the primitive, radially symmetrical type, they are identical in form and size with the lateral leaves. In all of our species they are smaller than the lateral leaves, usually of a different form, and oftenl entirely lacking. The form of the underleaves varies greatly but they are never complicate, as the lateral leaves often are. They may be entire (Figs. 13:2; 15:3), retuse, bifid or bilobed (Figs. 13:3; 14:4), or 3- to 4-lobed (Fig. 14:3); the lateral margins nmay be entire (Fig. 14:7) or provided with cilia (Fig. 13:3). In some cases the entire underleaf may be divided into cilia (Fig. 14:3); in other cases olily the lobes may be ciliate. In most cases the underleaves are entirely distinct and free from the leaves, but in a few cases they are connate, or fused, with a lateral leaf on one or both sides (Fig. 13:2) :* LEAVES The lateral leaves are attached in three fundamentally different ways: transverse (Fig. 14:1), succubously oblique, or succubous (Fig. 4:2-4), and incubously oblique, or incubous (Fig. 4:5, 6). The line of insertion, as has been shown by Buch, is determined by the position of the apical cell A (Fig. 4), whether it is strictly terminal (Fig. 4:1), dorsally displaced (Fig. 4:2-4), or ventrally displaced (Fig. 4:5, 6). In addition to these three distinct types of insertion, due to basic differences in the form of the growing point, there are various modifications of the line of insertion, and of the orientation of the leaf-planes, which are very significant in the determination of material. These may be grouped as follows: Transverse-This type of insertion (Figs. 4:1; 12:6; 14:6) is very rare among our species; only Anthelia, and to a less perfect degree Marsupella, show an insertion of this type. There are no significant variations of it. A * Often they are more or less hidden among the rhizoids, and barely perceptible; sometimes they are so small that they are seen with difficulty under the binocular micro- scope; at other times they are distinct near the stem apices only. Before one concludes that they are absent one must examine the under side of the stem with the 100 or 400 magnification of the compound microscope.</page><page sequence="13">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 269 shoot apex, showing this type of leaf-insertion is shown, less diagrammatically, in Fig. 5:1. Succubous-Various modifications of the succubously oblique type of inser- tion are characteristic of the large majority of our leafy Hepaticae. These modifications fall into four general types: a. Simnple succubous (Figs. 4:2; 5:3-4, 6-7, 11; 13:2). In this type both the dorsal and ventral portions of the cline of insertion are oblique. Associated with this type of insertion we generally find that the leaf-planes are oblique or nearly horizontal (Figs. 4:7; 5:11; 13:1-3, 8). Cephalozia, Lophozia, and Jungermannia are common genera with this type of insertion. b. Succubous-transverse. (Fig. 4:3, 8). This type of leaf-insertion shows a distinctly succubously oblique ventral line of insertion, but the dorsal por- tion is nearly or quite transverse. In consequence, species with this type of insertion usually show complicate leaves, e.g., they have the dorsal half folded over the ventral leaf (Figs. 4:8; 13:6, 7; 15:2). When the dorsal half of the leaf is loosely folded over the ventral half, a more or less concave leaf results, often known as complicate-concave.

(A. apical cell; B. zone of cell- division; C. zone of cell-elongation.)</page><page sequence="14">270 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) is a genus with this type of leaf-insertion and leaf-blade orientation. An extreme derivation from this type is the following: c. Succubously complicate-bilobed (Figs. 4:4, 9; 15:1-2). In this type there has been development of a sharp folding-over region between the dorsal and ventral halves of the leaf; this sharp fold is called the keel, or commissure (Fig. 4:9). Very generally plants with leaves of this type also show a phenomenon called decurrence, in which the dorsal and ventral leaf-bases (or both) appear to "run" down the stem (Fig. 4:9). The succubously compli- cate bilobed type of leaf occurs only in the Scapaniaceae, among our families. It is often referred to merely as "complicate-bilobed," but this does not distin- guish it from the incubously complicate-bilobed type of leaf; see below. In the succubously complicate-bilobed type of leaf the dorsal half of the leaf is always appreciably smaller than the ventral half. Incubous-This form of leaf-insertion is relatively infrequent. Two sub- types may be distinguished: a. Simple incubous (Figs. 4:5, 10; 5:5; 14:4, 5). In this type both dorsal and ventral portions of the leaf-insertion are oblique, and the leaf lies, in consequence, in a single plane. This type of insertion occurs in Calypogeia and Bazzania, among our genera. An intermediate type occurs between this and the transverse type of insertion in genera such as Ptilidium, where the dorsal half of the insertion is slightly incubous, while the ventral half is virtu- ally transverse. b. Incubously complicate-bilobed (Figs. 4:6, 11; 15:4-6, 8). In this type of leaf, the dorsal half of the line of insertion is incubous, while the ventral half is bent under, and more or less succubous. In all species with this type of leaf-insertion, the dorsal lobe is larger than the ventral half of the leaf, and the two halves are folded over each other. In consequence, the incubously shingled dorsal portions of the leaves hide under them the smaller ventral halves of the leaf (Fig. 15:7). The beginner may easily overlook the small, hidden ventral lobe of such complicate-bilobed types, and will then consider the leaf-insertion to be simply incubous. The leaves also vary greatly in form. They may be entire (Figs. 13:8; 14:5), with denticulate margins (Fig. 15:1), or variously lobed or divided. The divided leaves fall into several classes: 1) simply bilobed type (Figs. 12:6; 13:1, 2), with no keel between the two lobes. 2) complicate-bilobed type (Fig. 13:6-7) with the lobes folded over each other. 3) complicate- carinate type with the two lobes sharply separated by an angular or keeled folded region. The complicate-carinate type falls in two distinct classes: one with the dorsal lobe smaller (Fig. 15:1, 2), and one with the ventral lobe smaller (Fig. 15:4-5, 8). The latter type is again subject to many variations: the ventral lobe (often called the "lobule") may be inflated (Fig. 15:6, 8), or flat (Fig. 15:3, 4), or it may become modified to form a small sac (Fig. 15:6), in which case it is commonly called galeate; 4) 3- to many-lobed type (Figs. 13:4; 14:3), with the leaves transverse or succubously inserted, and the apices 3-5-lobed. 5) Ciliate or fimbriate type (Fig. 14:1-2); with the leaf- lamina nearly, or entirely, lost by division into capillary filaments, or cilia,</page><page sequence="15">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 271 (.M d~~~~~~~~ v~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ v d~~~~ 2. 3v: d 6. 1~~~~~~4 7.~~~~~~~0 Fig. 5.-Mode of insertion of the leaves in Jungermanniae (from Buch). which are only a singie cell wide; the plants therefore with a fringed or fimbri- ate appearanice. LEAF-CELLS The forms of the cells, and of the thickenings between them, are of great use in determining genera and species, since this is readily ascertained by tear- ing a leaf loose from the plant and studying it under the monocular micro- scope. The cells may have thin walls (Fig. 6:6), uniformly thick walls (Fig. 6:1, 5), or collenchymnatous walls, in which case they have distinct thickenings, called trigones, at the angles (Fig. 6:2, 3, 7). The trigones vary in size, within definite limits, in each species, and their prominence is of importance in separating species: they may be small, with concave sides (Fig. 6:3), or large, with bulging, or convex, sides (Fig. 6:2, 7).

The chloroplasts generally do not have much importance in determination, but their size is constant, within limits, for a given species. They may be larger than the oil-bodies (Fig. 6:1), equal to them in size, or somewhat to distinctly smaller (Fig. 6:6). The size relationship between chloroplasts and oil-bodies has not been noted in the literature, but often gives valuable clues to the identity of a species. The oil-bodies have recently received much attention, since they are fre- quently of an extremely characteristic form, peculiar to a single species or genus. They usually disappear rapidly after the death of the plant, hence must be studied in living plants. In many cases even fragments of living plants can be determined on the basis of the type of cell-wall, cell-size, and oil-body. For that reason, the oil-body form is stressed in some cases in the present work. Some of the more distinctive types of oil-bodies are pictured in Figs. 6 and 7. On the basis of their structure, they have been classified into 7-8 types (K. Muller, 1939, 1939a) The most obvious types are as follows: Oil-bodies quite homogeneous within (Fig. 7:6), not appearing to be composed of small oil-spherules. Oil-bodies many per cell, composed of numerous small oil-spherules, which protrude very slightly through the common containing membrane, giving the surface a more or less papillose or warty appearance (Fig. 6:1-2, 5, 7). Oil-bodies as in preceding, but very large and plate-like and occurring singly per cell. Oil-bodies distinctly segmented, composed of obvious (and usually relatively few) strongly protuberant oil-globules, often giving the entire oil-body the appearance of a cluster of grapes (Figs. 6:3, 4, 6; 7:7). In most cases the oil-globules are nearly uni- form in size (Fig. 6:3, 4, 6), but sometimes they may be extremely unequal in size (Fig. 7:7). In addition to these more obvious (but not sharply isolated) morphological types there is much difference between various species as to 1) size, 2) number per cell of the oil-bodies. Unless otherwise noted, oil-body size and number data given refer to median leaf-cells; the basal celis are often larger and have a greater number of oil-bodies, while the marginal and apical cells may have fewer and smaller bodies, or may quite lack them (note Fig. 6:7). Finally, though the oil-bodies are usually of a glistening, hyaline, colorless appearance, they may have a distinct pigmentation. In C'alypogeia tricho- manis, for instance, they are distinctly bluish, while in Geocalyx graveolans they are quite brownish in color. RHIZOIDS The rhizoids and their occurrence have been virtually ignored in the identi- fication and classification of the leafy liverworts because, in contrast to rhizoids of Marchantiales, they are always simple and smooth (lack internal thicken- ings) in the leafy liverworts. However, in the determination of genera and their classification they may be very important, and liverworts fall into two distinct types on the basis of distribution of the rhizoids. a) Those with scattered rhizoids that occur over the entire ventral stem surface (Fig. 13:2).</page><page sequence="18">Oo O o% 2. ~ ~ ~ ~~~~ o~~~~2 ~ o 0 000c Fig. 7.-Cell-types and oil-body types; cross-sections of setae. 1.

STEM The stem is structurally quite simple in leafy Hepaticae, and in general is of little importance in the identification of species and genera. It is developed from a tetrahedral apical cell that has three cutting faces at its posterior end (Fig. 5:1a). The apical cell regularly cuts off cells behind it, and each of these cells forms a stem-segment (merophyte). The merophyte (Fig. 5:1, m) results from the gradual cell-division and cell-differentiation of this single original cell. In the process of division, an anterior region is differentiated (stippled dark in Fig. 5:1, 5, 7), that eventually bulges out and cuts off the leaf-rudiment. The leaf, therefore, is essentially developed from the anterior margin of the merophyte; the rest of the merophyte consists of stem-tissue. Various modifications (Figs. 5:5, 7) have developed, in which there is modi- fication of the origina'l division into an anterior region, producing the leaf, and a posterior region, developing stem-tissue. The stem usually shows little dorsiventral differentiation, and often shows little difference between the outer cell-layers (cortex) and the inner cell-layers (medulla). Although the structure of the stem is unimportant, in general, for our purposes, its mode of branching is often very important. There are two basic types, superficially: a) the dichotomous type, as in Bazzania, in which there is division into two equal or nearly equal branches, with no obvious division into "stem" and "branch." This type is rare in leafy liverworts, but common in thallose forms. b) the pinnate type, in which there is an axis with branches, obviously of lesser importance, arising at various points on the main shoot. On the basis of origin of the branches one can distinguish several important types, usually limited to a family or groups of genera: a) branches originating in or near the axil of a lateral leaf, with the sub- tending leaf unmodified (the axillary type). b) branches originating laterally but occupying the position of part of the nearest leaf (eitlhir the dorsal or ventral half, usually the ventral). c) branches originating in the axil of an underleaf, or originating ventral- ly, i.e., postical branching. d) the endogenous type, (distinguished from all three above in that the branches originate from mature parts of shoots) in which a group of internal cells proliferates and forms a "bud" which breaks through mature stem tissue to form a new shoot. This type is usually not of importance in classification. STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH REPRODUCTION These fall into two logical types: Male structures-The antheridia universally occur in the axils of lateral leaves. These leaves are, as a rule, variously modified, often concave, or sac- cate, at the base: often with an additional dorsal tooth; sometimes larger than</page><page sequence="20">276 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) normal leaves, sometimes smaller, and, in the aggregate, form the androecium, together with the antheridia. The position and size of the androecium are important for classification, but are of little use here. The androecia may be small and lateral, small and postical, or terminal or intercalary. Their bracts may be diffuse, or very closely aggregated. The leaves in which the antheridia are found are called the perigonal bracts. Female structures-The female sexual organs in leafy Hepaticae always occur at the apex of a main shoot, a short lateral shoot or a short or long ventral or postical slhoot. The position of these shoots is often important in determination. In iimany groups with female inflcrescences on lateral or ven- tral shoots, the shoot may be so reduced in length that the inflorescence seems sessile laterally or ventrally on the main axis. However, in the Jungermanniales the female inflorescence is always strictly terminal, the apical growth region (apical cell) being used up during arche- gonia formation. The female sexual organs, or archegonia, are flask-shaped. They occur in groups, usually surrounded by a gametophytic structure called the perianth. In most leafy Hepaticae (Julgermanninae, Ptilidiinae) there are a larger number of archegonia in each inflorescence, but in the most specialized sub- order (Porellinae) there has been progressive reduction of the number of archegonia, until we find only two per inflorescence. The perianths may assume very different forms, the more dominant types of which are: 1. The terete, or cylindrical type. This occurs in the Ptilidiaceae, Lopho- ziaceae, and Jungernanniaceae. In some cases (Jungermannia lanceolata, Leiocolea) it may be suddenly narrowed to a beak at the apex; it is then called rostellate. 2. The trigonous type. This occurs in 'Cephaloziaceae and Harpantha- ceae, Lophocoleaceae, etc. It falls into two basically different categories: a. Third keel postical, the Cephalozia type. b. Third keel dorsal, or antical, the Lophocolea type. 3. The compressed type. This, too, can be divided into two fundamen- tally distinct categories, as follows: a. The dorsiventrally compressed perianth. This is the so-called scapaniate type, found in Radulaceae and Scapaniaceae. b. The laterally compressed type, found in the Plagiochilaceae. The perianth typically extends far beyond the leaves (perichaetial bracts) which occur immediately below it; it is then considered to be exserted beyond the bracts. Occasionally, however, it is much reduced in length, and does not extend beyond the bracts (which then hide it); in such cases it is considered to be included. Such genera as Marsupella and Cryptocolea have included reduced perianths; these very generally show a corresponding tubular extension of the apex of the shoot, below the perianth and perichaetial bracts; this tubu- lar extension of the peripheral portions of the stem is called the perigynium.* * The perigynium, superficially, appears to be the result of the fusion of the bases of the bracts with the perianth-base. Knapp has recently shown that ontogenetically no such fusion occurs, but that the perigynium results actually from the tubular outgrowth of the shoot-apex.</page><page sequence="21">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAF 277 In most cases the perigynium lies in the axis of the stem, but in some cases it becomes pendent and lies at right angle. to the stem apex, as in Calypogeia. With elaboration of the perigynium, the perianth is usually nearly or quite lost (as in Geocalyx and Caiypogeia), and the perigynium becomes pendent and penetrates into the substrate. The pendent, subterranean perigynium also becomes more or less fleshy and covered with a thick outer layer of rhizoids. The perianth, when present, often shows clearly its origin from leaf-like structures. In Lophocolea, for instance, the perianth-mouth is deeply trilobed, with each lobe again bifid; indicating an origin from a ring of three bilobed leaves, such as occur below the inflorescences. In Cryptocolea the bilateral perianth is incised dorsally and ventrally, and shows a clear origin from a pair of lateral leaves. The hypothesized origins of the various perianth-types is suggested in Fig. 8. 3. Fig. 8.-Diagrammatic representation of peri- anth cross-sections, showing their origin, 1. Ceph- alozia-type; 2. Lophocolea-type; 3. Plagiochila- type (laterally compressed); 4. Radula-type (dor- siventrally compressed). 2. 4. Within the perianth lies the developing ovary, whose wall forms the calyptra. In most cases the calyptra is completely hidden within the perianth, but it may be exserted beyond it. The nature of the perianth mouth is of some specific importance because it may vary, in different species of one genus, for instance from crenulate to denticulate to ciliate. Below the perianth, and often sheathing it to some degree, occurs a pair of lateral leaves, called the perichaetial bracts, female bracts or sometimes (in proper context) simply bracts. They are usually larger than normal leaves, but may be equal to them in size, as in Gymnocolea. They usually differ somewhat from normal leaves, in form, in that they may have more lobes, or in that they may have dentate margins. The relaLionship of the male and female inflorescences is often important in determining species. The male bracts may occur on the same plant with the female bracts (the plants are then called monoecious, or bisexual), or on separate plants (then called dioecious, or unisexual). The monoecious types are further divided, on tlhe basis of the relationships of the male to the female organs, as follows: 1. Paroecious: the male bracts occur directly below the female bracts, on the same shoot. 2. Autoecious: the male and female bracts occur on separate shoots or branches. 3. Heteroecious: the male and female bracts occur indiscriminately either as in 1 or 2, sometimes on the same plant.</page><page sequence="22">278 TI-IE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Very rarely, the antheridia may occur in the same inflorescence with the archegonia; this condition is known as synoecious. The types of arrangement of the inflorescences is extremely important in determining species of some genera (such as Solenostoma and Cephaloziella). The various relations are schematically portrayed in Fig. 9.* SYNOECIOUS PAOCIOUS AUTOECIOUS HETEROECIOUS SYNOECIOUS MONOECIOUS DIOECIOUS BISEXUAL UNISEXUAL Fig. 9.-Diagrammatic representation of types of inflorescences. THE THALLOID OR FRONDOSE TYPE OF GAMETOPHYTE The various types of thalloid gametophytest are believed by many students to be originally derived from erect, terete, possibly dichotomously branching shoots: i.e., shoots with the radial symmetry found in most existing sporo- phytes. Certainly the existence of so many types of thallose gametophytes indicates that tlhey derived separately from several ancestral types. The funda- mental differences in organization of these gametophytes permits us to disctlss them under three distinct headings: * Several suggestions in tthis connection may prove useful. Firstly, if a plant is abundantly fertile, it is usually autoecious or paroecious. If sporophytes are present, the antheridia are usually disintegrated. In such cases, the plants may be mistakenly consid- cred to be unisexual. However, careful study of such plants will usually show that the male bracts differ sufficiently from the leaves (often by their stronger adaxial concavity), so that male bracts, sans antheridia, can be identified. Secondly, in the case of autoecioLs species, the connection between male and female branches may no longer be evident, duLe to decay of older parts of the plant, by the time capsules arel formed. It is usually safe to conclude a plant is autoecious, if male and female inflorescences are consistently found intermingled. Usually, if a tuft of plants is very carefully pulled apart with dissecting needles, while lying in water, whole plants can be isolated showing organic connection between male and female branches. Thirdly, it is often the case that dioecious plants are habitually sterile. However, it is quite unsafe to presume that because a plant is habitual- ly sterile, or produces only gemmae, it is of necessity dioecious. j Some students, among them Evans (1939), would derive all the thalloid types from erect radial forms that bear "leaves"; this, to my mind, is unwarranted because the polyphyletic origin of the group (which even Evans tentatively accepts) does not necessi- tate derivation of all the thallose forms from leafy forms. In the case of such genera as Blasia, Fossombronia, etc., there is good reason to believe that they are derived from erect, leafy forms. In the case of the Anthocerotales and Marchantiales there is no direct evidence indicating such derivation, although there is evidence pointing to possible deriva- tion from enation-free types similar to Rhynia.</page><page sequence="23">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 279 Metzgerine Type-In this type the thallus consists of uniform or nearly uniform cells, without differentiation into distinct tissues. The derivation from leafy types is indicated in some forms by th- presence of lateral lobes or scallops (for instance, in Blasia), as well as 'by the retention of a distinct "midrib" or "vein," undoubtedly representing the stem, or axis, of ancestral forms. The members of this type agree with- the Anthocerotales in the slight degree of specialization into tissues (and a'bsence of such specializations as air-chambers, pores, etc.). Unlike the Anthocerotales, the intracellular organ- ization is quite like that of the Jungermanniales: there are many small chloro- plasts, and there are (with a very few exceptions) distinct oil-bodies present. As in the Jungermaniniales, all the rhizoids are smooth; and the sex organs are usually surrounded by protective sheaths (involucres), or similar struc- tures. In the Metzgerine type, unlike the Jungermanniales, the cells are all thin-walled and never become collenchymatous; at most the walls become equally thickened. There is never any trace of underleaves (although ventral scales or papillae occur in some genera, such as Blasia, Moerkia, etc.). The female sex organs do not terminate a shoot, but are dorsal on the thallus (or dorsal on short ventral branches of the thallus). The latter difference is often difficult to appreciate because the developing sporophytes may occur at wllat appears to be the apex of short lateral thallus-branches (as in Riccardia), or may occur on very short ventral branches (as in Metzgeria). In all these cases, histologists have been able to demonstrate that the apical cell (from which all growth proceeds) is not used up in the formation of the sex organs. This is in direct contrast to the Jungermanniales. As in the Jungermanniales, the developing sporophyte is usually surrounded by a sheath (called the pseudoperianth, because it is considered to be not homologous to the perianth). There may be a single sheath, varyingly flap- like, tube-like, etc., or, as in one group, there may be two sheaths: an outer one, of scales, that develops first, and an inner one, more or less tubular, that develops later. Two related famiiies, in which the pseudoperianth either has been lost or has never evolved, have developed a club-shaped, fleshy calyptra. Anthocerotean Type-The thallus in this type is like that of the Metz- geriales in that there is little or no specialization into tissue, all the cells being parenchymatous. There are in some cases, however, distinct stomata on the underside which may open into slime cavities (usually filled with blue-green algae). Unlike in the Metzgeriales there is never distinct indication of deriva- tion from a leafy type* and our forms are all in distinct rosettes, or in circles. The most characteristic feature of the gametophyte, is the intracellular organization: each cell has a large plate-like lhIoroplast, containing a complex starch-organizing central pyrenoid. There is no indication of the presence of oil-bodies, and the cell-walls lack tlhe ability to produce trigonous thickenings. * Kashyap, however, described Anthoceros erectus, a species in which there appears to be some indication of an erect terete form of gametophyte in the older portions of the plant. Such types do not occur in our area.</page><page sequence="24">280 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) As in the Jungermainniae the rhizoids are all simple, and as in most Metz- geriales, there are no traces of ventral scales or leaves. Internal development of the sex organs is unique in this group. The androecia are grouped in small cavities, opening by a dorsal pore, within the thallus. The archegonia develop singly within such a cavity, and gradually become surrounded by a tube-like involucral sheath, quite unlike anything found elsewhere in the bryophytes. The reduction of the calyptra is also noteworthy. Both the above thalloid types differ from tlhe next one in superficial appear- ance: they are more transparent or translucent and always are more delicate, never at all leathery, in texture. Marchantiine Type-In this type of thallus there is a distinct differentia- tion into tissues (a dorsal epidermis, always with more or less distinct pores; directly beneath, a loose aerated tissue (with chloroplasts) containing large air-spaces; beneath the aerated tissue, a solid parenchyma-like tissue largely lacking in chloroplasts. The fleshy-to-leathery texture of the thallus and its constant opaquenless are characteristics that distinguish it to the naked eye. There is never indication of direct derivation from leafy forms* and the plants do not contain a distinct "midrib+." The rhizoids of this type are also distinctive: they are always of two kinds, one.smooth and one with peg-like thickenings. In intracellular organization, this type of thallus comes closer to Junger- manniae than to Anthocerotales. The cells contain numerous small chloro- plasts and lack complex pyrenoids. In the oil-bodies (which are absent in Clevea and many Riccias), the group is also different from the other two: the oil-bodies are large structures, 20 ,u or larger, and occur singly in specialized cells that lack chloroplasts. These cells are usually scattered throughout the thallus, and stand out quite noticeably under the monocular microscope. In many forms they are most obvious in the ventral scales, because the cells con- taining them are unpigmented, while all surrounding cells are purplish. The ventral scales of this type of plant-body are characteristic: they occur in 2 to 6 rows, usually in 2, and most often serve as protective structures for the delicate ventral thallus-surface. Similar ventral scales do not occur else- where (except in Blasia). In many of the Riccias they are much reduced and not obvious. In position and organization of sex organs the present type of thallus is distinctive, in that the antheridia occur usually in groups, or androecia, which may be more or less specialized. In some genera the antheridia are aggregated loosely on the thallus surface (and do not inhibit further growth of the branch * The ventral side has ventral scales, often large and with purplish pigment, which some students believe are possibly homologous with leaves. This seems highly unlikely to the writer, who would rather believe that such enation-like structures could have had several separate origins, and are therefore to be interpreted as analogous, rather than homologous, structures.</page><page sequence="25">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 281 on which they occur, as in Mannia fragrans). In other groups they occur in distinct disks, below the female inflorescences, and also do not inhibit further growth of the shoot (Reboulia). In still other types they occur at the apices of short lateral shoots in disk-like receptacles, whose formation totally stops further growth of the shoot (Mannia pilosa); in still other groups they occur at the apices of elongate shoots, whose growth they inhibit (Conocepha- lum). Even more specialized than any of these types is the condition found in Preissia and Marchdntia, where the antheridial disks are elevated on stalks formed of gametophyte tissue, and form peltate structures (antheridiophores). The archegonia, like the antheridia, may occur in groups, and normally many or all of them develop. These groups, in our forms, are always on stalked peltate receptacles (archegoniophores, carpocephala), similar in type to the stalked antheridiophores mentioned above. In the Riccias, however, the archegonia do not occur in shlarply circumscribed groups, but are scattered in depressions over the tlhallus, and are not elevated; in fact, after fertilization they become completely immersed in gametophyte tissue, and are sunk in the thallus. THE SPOROPHYTE For our purposes the spore-producing generation, which is always attached to the gametophyte, is of relatively little importance in determination. Be- cause it is of relatively little use in keys, it will be very summarily discussed here.* There are, in the Hepaticae, radially symmetrical sporophytes only (in the mosses they often become more or less bilaterally symmetrical). In a division according to form, they fall into two major types that have very little in common: Primitive Anthocerotean Type-This type retains, in most forms, a zone of meristematic tissue that permits indefinite continuance of growth; in addi- tion, the seta, if present at all, is very small. The type can be recognized at once by its cylindrical form: the capsule is many times longer than wide, usually filiform; at maturity it splits into two valves. The wall of the capsule consists of at least three layers of cells, of which the outer bears distinct stomata. Such stomata do not occur elsewhere in Hepaticae. In addition, there is retained in this type a distinct central strand of sterile cells, the coli- melia; a columella does not occur elsewhere in Hepaticae, but occurs in many moss-types, and also occurred in many primitive Psilophytales. Finally, the contents of the capsule are characteristic: there are no spiral elaters, as there are in all our other forms. These are replaced by unique, often multicellular, more or less geniculate and angularly bent pseudoelaters. The spores, as in other thallose forms, are large, and over 35 ,u in diameter. Reduced Type of Sporophyte-This type differs from the above in that * The sporophytic features, however, are very important in classification into major categories (orders, families).</page><page sequence="26">282 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) there is a small, much reduced capsule, usually more or less brown in color, that lacks stomata and is rarely more than 2-5 cells thick. This capsule is spherical or shortly cylindrical, and rarely dehisces into two valves. There is a complete loss of the columella, and there are usually (in our forms) dis- tinct sterile cells, scattered amidst the spores, called elaters, each consisting of a single cell bearing spiral thickenings. The capsule usually is elevated on a more or less elongate seta (although there are some exceptions here), which lacks ability for indefinite growth. From this type of sporophyte (occurring throughout the JUNGERMAN- NIAE) consistintg of a brown, usually 4-valved capsule on an elongate stalk (seta), and a basal region, or foot, which forms an anchor in the gametophyte tissue, there has been modification by reduction, in two steps, as follows: The Jungermannine type. The least modified type. The AIarchantiine type. In this type the seta is reduced to a very short stalk, and the capsule is not exserted far beyond the containing gametophyte tissue. Indeed, the capsule usually remains more or less surrounded by gametophyte tissue. There has also been reduction in the capsule-wall in this type: it consists, except for the terminal part, of one layer of cells. The Ricciine typc. In this type the seta has been lost, and the sporophyce is reduced to a mass of large spores contained in a sporangium, consisting of a single layer of cells, lacking thickenings, that forms a delicate wall. This sporanigium is sunk witllin the thallus, and spores are freed by rupture of the upper or lower thallus surface upon local decay of the parent gametophyte. Because the capsule wall is often of some importance in classification, it is discussed in more detail. It may bear various forms of pigmented thickenings (which usually give it the brownish color) that fall into several types: a) an- nular, the complete ring-like type; b) semiannular, the semicomplete type (in which there is an incomplete ring formed, with complete bands on the radial walls and bands on one of the tangential walls); and c) the nodular type (so named because the radiaIl walls have bands which, in surface view, are seen end-on, causing the ends of the rods to appear as nodules attached to the tangential wall). In almost all Hepaticae of the Jungermannine type one of the three types of thickening occurs in the capsules (often there are two types present, one in the inner layer, one in the outer). In many of the Marchan- tiine type bands of thickening also occur in the capsule, but in quite a number the walls are not at all thickened. In all Hepaticae of the Ricciine type there is no trace of bands of thickening in the capsule. DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN HEPATICAE AND MOSSES Although traditionally the bryophytes are divided into two equal categories, variously considered as subphIyla or classes, the Hepaticae and Musci, there is evidence to indicate the following is a more natural division:</page><page sequence="27">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 283 Class I ANTHOCEPOTAE - Order 1 Anthocerotales [Order 1 Calobryales fSubclass 1 Jungermanniae Order 2 Jungermanniales Order 3 Metzgeriales Class II HEPATICAE [Order 4 Monocleales LSubclass 2 Marchantiae JOrder 5 Naijaditales Order 6 Sphaerocarpales lOrder 7 Marchantiales rSubclass 1 Andreobrya Class III Musci Subclass 2 Sphagnobrya lSubclass 3 Eubrya Of these groups, Classes I + II constitute the Liverworts, Class III, the Mosses. Of the Hepaticae, only orders 2, 3 and 7 are represented locally. The reasons for the above classification (as well as for the division of the various orders given into suborders, as on the following pages) are discussed in another connectioln (Schuster, MS). LIVERWORTS Usually dorsiventrally compressed: i.e., possessing dorsiventrality, often becoming thallose. Capsule never with a complex dehiscent lid, never with a peristome, rarely with a columella (in the Anthocerotales). Capsule and seta usually delicate and the entire sporop-hyte short-lived. Capsule never cernuous, and the sporo- phyte always radially symmetrical. Leaves (except rarely at base) of a single layer of cells, without a median vein, never strongly bristle-tipped (in leafy forms) -the leaves always appearing two- ranked. Calyptra ruptured at tip when sporo- phyte is exserted. Protonema ephemeral. Rhizoids one-celled. MOSSES Usually radially symmetrical and erect; never thallose. Capsule usually with a dehiscent lid, a peristome, and columella (splitting into four valves in the Andreales, however, and with no peristome in some forms). Sporophyte and its capsule usually of firmi tissue, long-persistent. Capsule often cernuous, the sporophyte sometimes only bilaterally symmetrical. Leaves with at least a median vein-like region several cells thick, the vein often ex- tending to the end of the leaf as a mu- cronate or bristle-like point. Leaves rarely two-ranked. Calyptra usually dehiscent basally when sporophyte is exserted, and thus carried aloft at apex of capsule. Protonema well-developed, persistent. Rhizoids many-celled. Since all thallose bryophytes belong to the Hepaticae, difficulty in separat- ing mosses from liverworts will be experienced only with the foliose forms. As is evident from the above table, the pronounced dorsiventrality (flatten- ing) of the Hepaticae, with the leaves reduced to a pair of large lateral leaves, and the presence of a row of small ventral leaves (underleaves, that are often minute or absent) gives them a very different aspect from the true mosses.</page><page sequence="28">284 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 2.

The group is strongly isolated from other liverworts in that the sporophyte is not an ephemeral, transient affair, but persists usually until the death of the supporting gametophyte. It continues to grow from a constricted region at the base of the slender, 2-valved capsule. No other Bryophytes possess such a meristematic region. The spo- rophyte also approachles that of mosses (but not liverworts) in that there are- generally stomata in the walls (Fig. 10:5), and in the presence of a more or less distinct central strand, the columella (Fig. 16:1), of the capsule. One of our genera (Notothylas) is much reduced, has lost the stomata, and shows loss of the columella. Although the sporophyte of the Anthocerotae is complex (probably be- cause it has not been as highly reduced as that of other Hepaticae), the gametophyte, or thiallus, is quite simple. It is a rosette-like structure, quite translucent green, which consists of numerous similar cells, each of which contains a single large, plate- or saucer-like chloroplast (Fig. 11:4). In its rosette-like structure (Figs. 11: 1; 16:7, 10) the gametophyte is reminiscent of Riccia, a genus which often occurs under similar conditions. The Anthocerotae are characterized by a lack of oig-bodies, and by thin-walled cells (which never produce trigones). There is only one family, the Anthocerotaceae.* Three genera occur locally, separable as follows: 1. Sporophytes tall, erect, long and cylindrical, projecting far beyond the perichaetia at maturity (Figs. 11:1; 16:1, 7), with distinct stomates in the walls (Fig. 10:5); cells of the capsule-wall relatively thin; columella distinct (Figs. 11:1; 16:1); pseudoelaters fuscous or grayish, usually 1-3-celled and rod-like to vary- ingly bent or geniculate (Fig. 16:4) - 2 2.

The writer had, independently, arrived at the identical conclusion arrived at by Proskauer, and (1947, MS) had selected the name Xanthoceros for the yellow-spored species, a name which now becomes quite unneces- sary.

Fig. 16:7 Distributed like P. laevis, but much less common, and more restricted in occurrence. In Minnesota--known only from the Minnesota River Valley, but undoubtedly occurring in the St. Croix and Mississippi valleys and elsewhere in the southeastern third of the state. Because of the low precipitation in Minnesota this species (as well as others of the family) occurs only along river or stteam beds, on moist, alluvial soil or on the seepage- moistened, springy soil of their banks. Also occurring occasionally in moist ditches, and elsewhere (in areas with a more adequate water supply) in fallow fields. The species is a pioneer, like other Anthoceros species, and frequently occurs with others of its genus (especially macounii, crispulus and P. laevis), as well as with Pellia and Blasia, more occasionally with Plectocolea crenulata. This species resembles P. Iaevis in the tall, slender sporophytes (that look much like small grass seedlings), but differs from it in the more deeply divided thallus-lobes, the paler green color 'of the thallus, and the blackish spores. It is related1 much more closely to A. macounii, with which it shares the lacerately divided pale green thallus and the black spores. Unlike in A. macounii, the sporophytes are at least a centimeter tall at maturity, very slender, and have twisted, flexuous valves; the bases of, the sporophytes are surrounded by a cylindrical, tubular perichaetium 2.5-4.5 mm high. The spores, under the high power of the microscope, offer the surest means of separation: the outer (con- vex) face has numerous sharp spines, whose bases are connected to form a hexagonal meshwork; the inner faces, however, are flat, with foveate depressions or pits. In A. macounii outer and inner faces agree in having minute tubercles or irregular papillae, which are free and not connected to form a network: Distribution.-BROWN: New Ulm, Fink.

It occurs essentially in the Coniferous Forest Biome, but is also found to a restricted degree in the Deciduous Forest Region. In Minnesota this species appears to occur only in the</page><page sequence="39">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 295 easternmost part of the state, but will probably be found further westward. The two records cited below represent the westernmost records of the species. A. macounii, like the other species of its genus, is a member of the A nthoceros-Pellia- Blasia community (or Associule) of loamy, or clayey, moist banks. It occurs most com- monly on the lower edges of loamy-clayey, sprinigy, river banks, below the high-water level of spring floods. Apparently it is largely a species of such alluvial, fine-grained soils, and appears to be distributed through the agency of water (spring floods, wave action in lakes, etc.). On such moist banks it occurs most typically with P. laevis, Pellia epiphylla and neesiana, Blasia pusilla, Fossombronia foveolata, Marchantia, etc. Further eastward we have found it also with A. punctatus and F. wondraczekii. The vascular species, Gratiola neglecta (G. uliginosa), is often associated with it under such conditions. Although A. macounii agrees with the other members of the Anthoceros-Associule in occur- ring under conditions of direct sunlight, it differs from P. laevis, at least, in its pH requirements. At St. Croix State Park, where it is found with P. laevis, the latter occurs under a pH of 6:0-5.3, A. macounii, a pH of 5.4-4.9; only at about pH 5.3 do the two species actually grow together. The two species also occur with F. fovealata, at pH 5.8-4.9 (i.e., the latter has an intermediate range overlapping that of both). Readings for A. macounii had the following range: 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4. This species, when mature, can scarcely be confused with any other form. The short capsules (Fig. 16:1), usually 2-8 mm long, with relatively stiff andl, brittle valves (not spirally twisted), separate the species from our other Anthoceros, all of which have slender, long valves 10-30 mm long. The thallus is deeply lobed, with the lobes again divided into numerous small, truncate, or rectangular, to obcuneate lobes (much as in A. puncta- tus). As in A. punctatus, the spores are black, but 48-65 , and the inner faces of the spores are finely muriculate (papillose-spinulose), instead of being foveate (as in the case in A. punctatus). Furthermore, in A. macounii the elaters are rudimentary and very nminute, in punctatus, elongate and of 2-3 cells (Fig. 16:4). In its very short capsules and rudimentary elaters the species recalls Notothylas. The similarity is increased by the form of the thallus, and the (usually) small size. Because immature A. macounii plants with unripe capsules (which I have found as late as Oct. 30) are extremely superficially similar to those of Notothytas, the two will be confused by the beginner unless the following differences are noted: in A. macounii the capsules, even when immature, are more or less erect, and protrude somewhat through the perichaetia (in Notothylas they do not protrude yet have fully ripe spores before protrusion and are nearly horizontal). There is a distinct columella in A. macounii, and the capsule-walls have noticeable stomata (in Notothylas these are absent). In A. macounii the spores are black (in Notothylas yellowish).

The plants can be told from those of A. punctatus most easily by vegeta- tive characters: the thalli are prominently crispate, the dorsal surface with, many (rarely few), usually crowded lamellae. A. crispulus also has somewhat larger pseudoelaters, often 3-5 cells long (and then up to 200 j1 in length); the majority of pseudoelaters are, however, only 1-2 cells long, as is more typical of A. punctatus. PHAEOCEROS Proskauer (Bull. Torr. Bot. Club 78:346, 1951) PHAEOCEROS LAEVIS (L.) Proskauer Fig. 16:5-6 Very widely distributed, throughout most of the temperate regions of the world, north- ward well into the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, but becoming rarer there. In Minnesota found along river-courses, probably throughout the state (but unknown from the north- western quarter). The species, like other Nearctic Anthocerotales, is a pioneer on non- organic soils, chiefly of a fine, heavy consistency (loam or clay), at the edges of lakes, or stream-beds, along paths and wagon roads. Very infrequently it grows on rocks in brooks (as at Taylors Falls) or on the vertical sides of moist, soft sandstone, with Plectocolea hyalina (as at Taylors Falls). The species is typically a member of the Anthoceros- Pellia-Blasia Associule, occurring with A. macounii (at St. Croix), A. punctatus (Granite Falls), and occasionally with A. crispulus, as well as with Pellia epiphylla and neesiana (St. Croix), or Notothylas.* The species occurs under circumneutral to slightly acid con- ditions (pH 5.3-6.0, with actual measurements 5.3, 5.4, 5.7, 5.9, 6.0), and appears to occur with A. macounii only near its lower pH tolerance. Occasionally (when it occurs on calcareous sandstone, as at Taylor's Falls), it may occur under a pH as high as 6.8- 7.3 The species, like other members of its genius, occurs under conditions of intermittent to nearly constant sunlight, only occasionally growing in shade. This species is easily separated from the species of Anthoceros: the capsules, when mature, appear yellowish under the green walls, because of the dense yellow spores. Our other species have black spores, and the capsules at maturity are blackish. The sterile plants of this species are quite flat, with the broad main lobes undivided or obscurely lobed; never with numerous truncate, or obcuneate, marginal lobes (P1. 1:5). The deep green color of sterile plants also distinguishes them from the black-spored species. Distribution.-BROWN: New Ulm, Fink. KooCHICHING: Rainy Lake City, Fink; Big Falls, Nelson.

Phaeoceros laevis fo. carolinianus (Schweinitz) comb. n. Anthoceros carolinianus Michx., Fl. Bor. Am. 2:280, 1803. This variant has generally been considered a discrete species, with a more southern distribution than the species proper (i.e. than laevis). I fail to find any characters of specific importance separating the two, and can at best consider carotinianus a form occur- ring under more moist conditions. Typically carolinianus has the involucres taller and not at all expanded at the mouth, while laevis proper has shorter involucres, expanded distally. In carolinianus, green, glandular, marginal thickenings of the thallus (Fig. 16:6) are supposedly commonly pres- ent; in laevis proper, rare. In carolinianus the spores are given as 35-56 ,u in diameter; in laevis 30-40 A. Finally, the sporophytes are supposed to be larger in carolinianus, attain- ing a height of 35 mm or more in many cases, while those of typical laevis are rarely * More rarely P. laevis occurs as a member of the Preissia-Mannia rupestris Associule, as on vertical basic sandstone walls in Winona and Houston counties, associated with Preissia quadrata, Lophocolea minor, and other calciphytes.</page><page sequence="41">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 297 more than 20-30 mm tall. It is apparent that the above characters are all comparative. At St. Croix State Park the writer found laevis common: the material there grew on a moist, often dripping, wet bank, under unusually hygric conditions (even in October, 1948, one of the driest autumns on record). This material had involucres uniformly narrowed near the tip, never expanded (as in carolinianus), but only 2-2.8 mm tall (nearer the size in laevis); glandular, thickened, green, marginal growths extremely abun- dant and conspicuous (Fig. 16:6); spores varying from 38-50 ,u, with the average 40-48 A (nearer carolinianus); the sporophytes were mostly 2-2.5 cm tall (as in laevis). Thus, in mnost characters, the material was more nearly typical of carolinianus, while the site was unusually wet for typical laevis. The probability that carolinian,us is merely a modifi- cation of laevis produced under more moist conditions, while yet to be proved, seems to be borne out by the present evidence. The spore-size is extremely variable, even in the same patch of plants: some capsules have spores that largely average 45 ju others, spores mostly 38-42 ,u. Age possibly may be a factor here. NOTOTHYLAS Sulliv. NOTOTHYLAS ORBICULARIS (Schwein.) Sulliv. Fig. 16:8-10 Widely distributed throughout the Deciduous Forest region of the eastern United States becoming rare in the lower part of the Coniferous Biome. In Minnesota appar- ently restricted, like Anthoceros, to the Mississippi, St. Croix and Minnesota river systens, although known from but a single locality; undoubtedly of wide distribution, but every- where infrequent and often rare. The species, like Anthoceros, often occurs along the edges of streams and rivers, where it invades alluvial, sandy soil, usually with Blasia pusilla, P. Iaevis, and A. punctatus, occa- sionally with A. macounii, Pellia epiphylla and Fossombronia species. More rarely the species occurs on moist loamy or clayey soil at the edges of disturbed paths. The basic requirements appear to be an entirely mineral substrate of a compact or} fine texture (i.e., of a high water-retaining capacity), and a rather constant but moderate water supply. The species (together with Anthoceros) is quite unable to exist under conditions of consider- ably intermittent moisture. Like Anthoceros and Blasia, the species is able to tolerate much direct sunlight: hence it often invades the moist soil of sand bars, where it may occur with terrestrial forms of Riccia fluitans and Ricciocarpus. N. orbicularis can scarcely be confused with other Hepaticae. The horizontal capsules, included at maturity within the perichaetia (except for the extreme apex) are character- istic. Anthoceros macounii has short (but erect) sporophytes; it furthermore has black, inot yellow, spores. Immature plants of A. macounii may be confused with Notothylas, h-owever. Distribfition.-WINONA: Mississippi River bottoms, H.</page><page sequence="42">298 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 'Class HEPATICAE The Hepaticae (s. str.) include a great diversity of types, which differ in several fundamental respects from both the Anthocerotae and Musci. Among some of these circumscribing features are the absence of a columella, or central sterile axis of the sporangium (present in both Anthocerotae and Musci), and the presence of oil-bodies (see Figs. 6, 7), in all or some cells (absent in both Anthocerotae and Musci). Furthermore, the Hepaticae always possess a very delicate, ephemeral sporophyte, whose seta (where present) is built up of delicate cells that soon collapse; in the Anthocerotae and Musci the sporophyte is more robust, less ephemeral, and often persists for many months. Corre- lated with the greater robustness of the sporophyte in these latter two groups, we often find the presence of stomata (or their rudiments), and the presence of chloroplasts. The Hepaticae show neither chloroplasts nor stomates. A final difference of some significance is the means of dehiscence of the capsule. In the Hepaticae we generally have dehiscence by four valves, and dehiscence is accomplished by the more rapid drying-out of the external layers of the capsule-wall (compared with the inner layers); correlated we find a series of specialized thickenings or supporting rods and bands, of the capsule-wall cells, that aid in this process. In the Anthocerotae and Musci (except for some species of the anomalous genus Andreaea) the capsule-wall, which is usually many cell-layers thick, does not dehisce into four valves and has no system of localized stiffening bands and rods that are effective in aiding dehiscence. Numerous other differences separate the Hepaticae from the Anthocerotae, among them: the presence of many chloroplasts per cell; the 4-valved, little elongate capsule (vs. the 2-valved, fusiform to linear capsule of the Antho- cerotae); the absence of stomata of both gametophyte and sporophyte (vs. their presence in at least sporophyte, and frequently gametophyte, in Antho- cerotae); the exogenous origin (i.e., from a superficial cell) of the sex organs (vs. the endogenous origin in the Anthocerotae); the strictly determinate type of growth of the sporophyte (vs. the indeterminate growth of the sporophyte in the Anthocerotae, in which we find a "basal" meristem, below the capsule). In the writer's opinion, therefore, the classification of the Bryophyta into three classes, following Howe, appears warranted. The 'Class Hepaticae, it is believed, can be separated most conveniently into two phylogenetic series, the Subclass Jungermanniae (in which we would include the following orders, forming an ascen-ding, thlough not necessarily linear, series: Calobryales, Jun- germanniales, Metzgeriales) and the Subclass Marchantiae (including, simi- larly, a series of orders not forminig a linear series: Monocleales, Sphaerocar- pales, Naijaditales, Marchantiales). These two subclasses, and their included orders, are separated by the gen- eral key (p. 285). The above classification is based on a series of postulates as follows: 1. The ancestral type of gametophyte was simple, possibly erect and terete and dichotomously branching (perhaps like a miniature Psilophy- tan), and underwent parallel evolution towards a flattened, dorsiventral type</page><page sequence="43">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 299 as a consequence to more perfect adaptation to a land environment; conse- quently, in each subclass there is postulated increasing dorsiventrality (often together with intemal differentiation between the secondarily upper and lower surfaces of the gametophyte). 2. Leaves, if present at all in the common ancestral form, might best be compared to gametophyte-enations, that may be modified and retained (Jungermanniales) or lost (Metzgeriales) with in- creased dorsiventrality; conceivably, in some groups, leaves may have developed independently; it is therefore postulated that the presence or absence of leaves is a character of slight phyletic value, since their absence or presence, and form, appear to be easily modified with adaptation towards different environmental extremes. 3. The sporophyte, since it is so ephemeral (and since it is only indirectly affected by the environment, due to its parasitism on the gameto- phyte) is less apt to show vacillation in form; this is postulated on the basis of the obvious fact that since this generation is short-lived, since it does not have to be covered by a film of water in order that spores be formed, and since it can only indirectly be affected by the environment, it should show less response to environmeintal pressures. It is easy to demonstrate that the sporo- phyte in Hepaticae shows infinitely less diversity, while the gametophyte exhib- its tremendous degrees of enviroinmentally "induced" variation.* 4. Since the sporophyte is more or less parasitic on the gametophyte, we should expect more primitive groups to show sporophytes that are morphologically more complex, less reduced; inversely, more highIy evolved or "specialized" groups, should show (consequent upon a longer history of parasitism of the sporo- phyte on the gametophyte) a more reduced, simpler sporophyte. 5. The hypothetical ancestral type showed a sporophyte with a discrete seta, with a thick sporangium wall, with chloroplasts and relative nutritional independence; such sporophytes were probably not as strongly inhibited in their growth by size restrictions placed upon them by the gametophyte. Inversely, with greater parasitism, the sporophyte became more "dependent" and thus was more lim- ited by the size of its host; hence "tended' to become smaller with the passage of time, through a process of selection, resulting in elimination of sterile tis- sues. 6. The gametophyte, because of the aquatic type of fertilization, could not grow beyond certain obvious size limits. 7. Therefore, we should expect to find a pattern of evolution in the group in which we find correlated a pro- gressive specialization of the gametophyte, linked with a progressive simplifi- cation (reduction) of the sporophyte. The above classification has been worked in such a fashion that it will reflect (as well as any linear classification can) these basic postulates that have been outlined above.t * The writer would therefore agree with Muller (1939-1940) in placing the greatest emphasis on the sporophyte generation, in the classification of the Hepaticae. t The entire problem of the classification of the Hepaticae will be examined in much more detail, in an exhaustive treatment of the problem to appaar elsewhere (Schuster, Mss, in press).</page><page sequence="44">300 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Subclass JUNGERMANNIAE The Jungermanniae include all the "leafy" liverworts, and many of the simpler frondose or thallose types. The group is essentially circumscribed by a number of cytological and embryological characters that are not easily ascer- tained with ordinary techniques. The most important of these characters are the numerous chloroplasts per cell (in contrast to Anthocerotae), and the generally small and more or less numerous oil-bodies, which usually occur in nearly all of the somatic cells (in contrast to Anthocerotae and Marchantiae). The more obvious differences in structure that separate the Jungermanniae are the retentioni by the sporophyte of a lol'g seta (short or absent in Antho- cerotae and Marchantiae), which is very delicate; hence the sporophytes are very ephemeral. The sporophytes also have a 4-valved capsule: a condition never existing in the Anthocerotae, and of very exceptional occurrence in the Marchantiae. In addition, the capsule-wall is normally 2-8 cell-layers thick (like Anthocerotae, unlike Marchantiae), but lacks all trace of stomates (like Marchantiae, but unlike Anthocerotae). The Jungermanniae agree with most Marchantiae in having spiral, 1-celled elaters (unlike most Antho- cerotae). The gametophyte (or green "plant") of the Junfgermanniae is extremely variable. The thallose types (when sterile) may be confused by the beginner with thalli of both Anthocerotae and some Marchantiae. Under the micro- scope the small, numerous chloroplasts at once eliminate the Anthocerotae, and the usual presence of many small oil-bodies, the Marchantiae. The rhi- zoids in the Jungermanniae are always uniform; in Marchantiae they are always dimorpllic: smooth and pegged. Furthermore, in the thallose Junger- manniae the thalli are parencllymatous, and consist of uniform cells without any air-chambers; in all of our Marchantiae the thalli are opaque, quite com- plex in their organizationi, and have dorsal layers of air-chambers. The Jungermanniae include three major groups (orders), of which two occur in Minnesota. However, because a single species (Haplomitrium hook- eni) of the third order may be found to occur in Minnesota, the group is included in the key: KEY TO ORDERS 1.

Plants anisophyllous: the ventral row of leaves slightly to strongly reduced or eliminated; leaves 2-several lobed (at least during their early ontogeny); cells normally more or less collenchymatous, with small to large trigones; rhizoids present; perianth surrounding the calyptra (or replaced by a fleshy perigynium).</page><page sequence="45">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 301 Sporophytes with capsule-wall 2-8 cells thick, the cells normally with numerous thickenings forming partial, or complete, transverse bands; spores generally small, 6-20 u; antheridia small, occurring only in axils of leaves .

Sporophytes with capsule-wall 2-4 cells thick, with thickenings (when present) transversely oriented; spores large, 25-60 tu, occa- sionally to 110 tu, diameter usually 4-8 times that of elaters - Metzgeria'es ORDER JUNGERMANNIALES The Jungermanniales, because of the dorsiventral organization of the plant, and because of the scale-like, overlapping leaves, have often been called "scale- mosses." The group includes over two-thirds of all known liverworts (and almost exactly four-fifths of the species of liverworts known from Minnesota). The order is rich in families (about 30 are recognized), which are very diffi- cult to separate without careful anatomical and cytological study. Many of these families are of doubtful status, and some conservative students place them all in a single family. (The only recent workers to adopt such a course are Frye and Clark.) Because of the difficulty of separating the families, a key to separate them is rarely attempted. The following key (written to include the North Ameri- can genera only) is the first devised to separate the families. It will not be usable for most sterile material (because the more fundamental family charac- ters often are based on the sporophyte). For that reason an artificial key to genera is added (p. 305). The numerous families of the leafy liverworts can be organized, in the writer's opinion, into four ch-ief groups (suborders). One of these suborders (the Pleuroziinae) does not occur locally; it differs from the other three in that the gametophyte grows frbm a 2-sided apical cell. KEY TO SUBORDERS OF JUNGERMANNIALESt 1. Leaves very variable, but without a specialized ventral "lobule" hidden beneath the larger dorsal "lobe" (Figs. 13:1, 3, 8; 14:1, 4, 6; 15:2); 1-2-celled gemmae fre- quently present in most groups; protonemal stage filamentous, without apical cell.

It is, however, vtery differ- ent from the leafy forms found in the Jungermanniales: the leaves are irregular, not distinctly lobed, and horizontally inserted; there is no trace of underleaves. t This classification is based on a recent paper (Schuster, MS, in press), which the student can consult for further details. The basic division of the leafy liverworts into ihree developmental series, each containing numerous families, is believed to be natural since it is based on: 1. Gross morphology of the gametophyte (leaf-insertion and type); 2. Type of rhizoid-initials; 3. Type of vegetative reproduction; 4. Type of development of sporeling; 5. Degree of preservation of sporophyte seta; 6. Spore-elater ratio; and 7. Bio- logical and ecological features of the major groups. One or two of these characters mav break down in individual cases, but the characters taken as a whole appear to be valid for the differentiation of major evolutionary lines.</page><page sequence="46">302 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) perianth (Fig. 12:3, 6); spores usually 7-20 ,u (rarely larger),* diameter 1-3 times that of the elaters (Fig. 12:4-5).

T Only the side-wise specialized Lophocoleaceae as well as a few other extraterritorial genera have developed (certainly independently) restricted rhizoid-initial regions. ? Only some species of the extremely specialized genus Calypogeia have developed bilobed or entire leaves, and more rarely subentire underleaves (Figs. 12:3; 14:4-5). 11 In a few genera of Lejeuneaceae the underleaves have been lost; in Radula the underleaves also have been lost, and the rhizoid-initial region has been reduced to a spe- cialized, restricted area on the lobules (Fig. 15:5). Occasionally rhizoids occur at the bases of only scattered underleaves. 4I This key is greatly simplified and is expressly intended to include only those genera and (sometimes species) occurring in this region.

They share, in common, a generally moderate or large size (only A. hellerianum, P1. 24:3 is minute), have transverse (PIs. 22:1; 23:2) or succubous, (Pls. 3:1; 5:1), 2-4-lobed leaves, and have reduced underleaves in some species, (PIs. 1:6; 7:4; 8:9-12; 10:4), but most often lack them (PIs. 13:5, 16:6). In addition, they have an obtusely plicate (PI. 18:1) (or occasionally terete, P1. 7:1), cylindrical free perianth, always situated at the apex of a main shoot: the androecia are similarly situated with the bracts subequal in size to leaves, but become intercalary with age (Pls. 18:2; 24:14). Unlike the Lophocoleaceae, the Lophoziaceae have the rhizoids scattered irregularly over the postical stem surface, often forming a dense ventral mat (P1s. 3:4; 5:1; 18:2; 27:1; 28:8), and generally have distinct (PI. 3:7) or large (PI. 4:2) trigones. They differ from the Harpanthaceae in the terminal position of the perianth (PI. 7:1) and of the androecia (the latter becoming intercalary by subsequent growth of the shoot). Confusion, except with these two fami- lies, is unlikely (except perhaps with the Marsupellaceae). The latter family, however, consists of species with shallowly bilobed leaves, often with obtuse apices, quite transverse in insertion, and have the stems usually provided with * The genus Solenostoma is generally divided into three genera, which are not sharply separated. These genera are here considered as merely subgenera, separable by the kev on p. 389.</page><page sequence="55">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 311 stolons; in addition, they have a reduced inconspicuous perianth hidden be- tween the longer, larger bracts; they also never produce gemnmae. The classification of this family has been very subjective, and is likely to remaini so, since so many annectant forms exist between what have been called genera. For tlhat reason the writer prefers to follow a conservative scheme, first elaborated in 1949.* The genera, and subgenera, may be separated by the following key. Since this entails sections of the stem in some cases, and the presence of gemmae and perianths in others, a purely artificial key, going right to species, is appended (see p. 314). The very diverse Lophozioid flora of this region makes the determination of the species rather difficult. In several cases a clear-cut determination can be made only from living material that bears perianths. Several of the best characters for dctermining members of the group have been overlooked until comparatively recelntly: the stem structure and the oil-bodies. To study the first, hand sections of stem placed between pith, which can be prepared in a minute or two, must be studied under the high dry oiective. To clearly see the oil-bodies, a magiification of 1000 or more must be used (i.e., oil-immer- sion). In the large majority of cases, however, the species can be determined with certainty with lower powers, and after they have been once recognized, can usually be determined with the hand-lens in the field. Some complexes are very difficult, however: the ventricosa complex of the gelnus Lophozia is notorious in this regard. Extreme specimens in this com- plex, that bear perialiths, can usually be placed. There is frequent develop- ment of phenocopiest in this complex, however, and these cannot be deter- mined at all by the usual taxonomic methods. These difficult species are discussed in detail in their proper connection.

(Dilophozia) porphyrolefca Genus LOPHOZIA Dumort. This large genus includes a great diversity of types, whose regional species have been split up into a few (Barbilophozia, Tritomaria, Lophozia) or many genera (Barbilophozia, Tritomaria, Orthocaulis, Isopaches, Lophozia, Leio- colea). Of these groups, Tritomaria is the only one I believe merits generic separation, while the rest of the genera are all so connected by intermediate forms that these "generic" groups are better recognized as subgenera. In this, with a few modifications. I follow Miuller (1939); and my own treatment (Schuster, 1949), in "The Hepaticae of Central and Western New York." Such a conservative treatment appears to be necessary from the point of practi- cability, since it is virtually impossible to make a key that will separate out the genera into discrete units.* I recognize a rather large number of subgeneric groups, of which one or two are of doubtful standing (Isopaches). These are separable in the key on p. 311. The species are separable by the artificial key to species on p. 314 In addition, keys to species of the various su'bgenera are given, under the sub- generic headings. * See in this connection the detailed study of this family in Schuster (1951).</page><page sequence="64">320 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Subgenus ORTHOCAULIS Buch This subgenus differs considerably in facies from the related subgenera, Leiocolea and Barbilophozia. Unlike these two groups, the leaves are rela- tively little oblique in insertion, and therefore often are nearly transversely oriented and the leaves are generally trilobate, on at least a few leaves (PIs. 1:3, 6; 3:1; 4:1, 3). Furthermore, underleaves occur frequently (except in attanuata and atlantica, where they are rare and minute) (P1. 1:6, 7, 10). The species also frequently grow suberect or erect: with the dorsiventrality less marked than in the species of Leiocolea and Barbilophozila. The leaves are more or less erect, with the lobes often more or less incurved (the leaves thus becoming somewhat concave, and shaped like a cupped hand) (Pls. 1:1; 3:1; 4:3). Since the leaves are less spreading than in the other two related sub- genera, the plants acquire a more terete appearance. The plicate perianth is similar to that of Dilophozia and Barbilophozia. In the more or less sub- transverse leaves, the subgenus approaches Tritomaria and Anastrophyllum. The usual presence of underleaves, the subsymmetrical leaves (PIs. 1:6, 8; 3:5-6), and their slightly oblique insertion separates the subgenus from Trito- maria.* Two species occur infrequently in the Spruce-Fir Climax region of Minne- sota, while a third has been found once in the "Tundra Strip." These species are separable as follows: all are robust species, over 1.5 mm wide and 2-4, or rarely 3-5 cm lonlg. KEY TO SPECIES 1.

(O.) quadrilobal LOPHOZIA (ORTHOCAULIS) KUNZEANA (Hueb.) Evs. P1. 1 This species is one of the limited number of Arctic-alpine "relics" occurring in Minre- sota. It has been found at the upper edges of moist ledges and cliffs, where -a dense carpet of mosses and hepatics hangs down. Here it is associated with such northern forms as Odontoschisma macounii, and with the vascular species, Empetrum nigrum, Ptimula mistassinica and Vaccinium uliginosum. Other frequently associated Hepaticae are: Ptilidium ciliare, Scapania nemorosa, Lepidozia reptans, Anastrophyllum micha,uxii, Tritomaria quinquedentata, Lophozia ventricosa, etc. The species also occurs often around acid, sunny rock pools, together with Sphagnum (as on Belle Rose I., and at Grand Marais), with Gymnocolea inflata, and the sundew, Drosera rotundifolia. One of the major requirements of the species seems to be a rather great amount of sunlight: it occurs most abundantly over rocks where there is moisture from seepage, but where the plants are often exposed to full sun. The species occurs under moderately acid conditions (14 pH measuremements ran from 4.0 to 5.7, with most measurements between 4.2 and 4.8). The presence of almost transverse, slightly oblique leaves, nearly all of which are bilobed (P1. 1:1, 3), together with the development of large amphigastria (P1. 1:6, 7, 8) (at least near the apices of most of the more robust sterile stems) will distinguish this species from all others found in the state. Confusion may occur perhaps with Anas- trophyllum michauxii, which has a somewhat similar facies and size. (Both species are 2-4 mm wide and 3-6 cm long.) The dorsal lobes in the latter are squarrose, however, and there is no trace of amphigastria. The small cells of A. michauxii (about 18-24 u in the leaf-middle) also distinguishes it from the present species (where the median leaf cells average nearly or quite 20 x 30 ,u). Most material, except where shaded unduly, is brownish or brownish-green in color, with the absence of any red in the brown; the cell-walls in such material are tinged yellow, much as in Anastrophyllum. L. (O.) floerkei, a somewhat more strictly Arctic-alpine species, may yet be found in our region. It agrees with kunzeana in possessing large underleaves, but differs in that the leaf-bases, ventrally, are armed with 1 or more cilia, and in that the lateral leaves are more shallowly lobed (to one-third) normally into 3 lobes.

This species generally occurs on exposed rock ledges, where it is either a pioneer, or invades soon after other Hepaticae come in. In the Lake Superior region it occurs on exposed rocks in the wave and spray-moist zone (together with Scapania cuspiduligera, Lophozia gillmani, and other calciphytes), or slightly above the wave-action zone (there</page><page sequence="66">322 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 90~~~~~~~~~~0 PLATE 1.

The species occurs under mesic to mesic-xeric conditions, and appears quite tolerant of basic substrates; in our area it occurs over basalt. L. quadriloba, on robust stems has a large percentage of its leaves almost equally four-lobed, as is implied by the name. On other shoots (especially on less robust stems) many of the leaves are 3-lobed, with two narrow ventral and a broader dorsal lobe. The local material represents a slender form, which approaches L. floerkei in the large number of 3-lobed leaves. It differs from floerkei in the deep sinuses (which extend for 1/2 - 3/5 the leaf length) in the coarsely papillose cuticle, and in the strongly reflexed leaf-margins, especially of the sinuses. In the deeply lobed leaves it approaches L. kunzeana (but the N 5. 9. I0. PLATE 2. Lophozia (Orthocaulis) quadriloba.-1. Apical part of large shoot. 2, 3, Underleaves. 4-7.

L. quadri- loba is also a more slender and delicate plant, dull olive-green or fuscous, or even blackish in color, and usually has rather strongly imbricate leaves that give the erect shoots a terete appearance.* The largely 4-lobed leaves might give cause for confusion with the subgenus Barbilophozia; however, the almost transversely oriented leaves, and the basal cilia of the leaves (formed of isodiametric cells), at once separate it from Barbilophozia. Distribution.-Not yet known from Minnesota, but found by the writer on the Kewee- naw Peninsula of Michigan, at Copper Harbor, and at the "Devil's Washtub," near Eagle Harbor. LOPHOZIA (ORTHOCAULIS) ATTENUATA (Mart.) Dumort. PI. 3 This distinctive species is widespread in the more northern part of the Spruce-Fir Zone; in Minnesota it appears to occur only near the Lake Superior Shore and in the Lake Region bordering Ontario. This species occurs both among mosses over thin soil on ledges or on their horizontal shoulders, and more rarely on rotting logs. It occurs frequently with Scapania nemorosa, with various other species of LophoZid (especially Xentricosa and longidens, etc.), and with Anastrophyllum michauxii and Tritomaria exsecta and exsectiformis, often with the xerophytic moss, Dicranun. On the Susie Islands, where the species is common, it occurs over peaty soil on exposed, northwest-facing ledges; lhere it may occur with such peat-"loving" species as Mylia anomdia and Odontoschisma denudatum (at a pH ranging around 3.8-3.9). This species is one of the easiest of our Hepaticae to recognize in the field, even with the naked eye. The presence of numerous erect, slender, thread-like shoots, arising from the apices of normally leaved shoots or as innovations from beneath the perianths, is quite distinctive (P1. 3:11). These shoots are usually produced in great numbers and may be very crowded. The only other frequent species with which it could be confused on this account is L. (Leiocolea) heterocolpa, which has uniformly bilobed, horizontally spreading leaves on the lower parts of its shoots. Unlike L. heterocolpa, L. attenuatd totally lacks underleaves (P1. 3:2), and has cells with small trigones, with concave sides (PI. 3:7, 8); the cells of the leaf-tips are only about 13-16 Au.

I have never seen L. kunzeana from subbasic sites; however, L. quadrilobus appears to be our one species of the subgenus that can toleri ate subbasic or basic conditions. Miiller (1910; p. 643) also states the species occurs both on "Kalk- und Urgesteinfelsen." This mistaken determination of the Michigan plants is apparently due to the fact that these plants represent a mod. parvifolia-pauciloba, due to growth under unduly drv conditions. The many small, slender plants found with 2-, occasionally 3-lobed leaves suggest L. kunzeana, as do the deep leaf-sinuses. However, these plants (which appear to be the same as fo. heterophylla Bryhn et Kaal.) differ from L. kunzeana in the constant absence of gemmae; the terete, densely leaved, erect shoots that have an olive-green to fuscous (rather than bright green to golden brown) pigmentation; the frequent presence of basal cilia of the leaves; the nearly smooth cuticle, and in the much inferior size (leafy shoots only 500-750 as wide). With prolonged collecting in the same area more nearly normal plants were found, 1.2 mm wide or more, showing many 4-lobed and many 3-lobed leaves, much wider than long. The very constant absence of gemmae, in all forms seen of the species, appears to be an excellent species characteristic separating L. quadriloba from the very commonly gemmiparous L. kunzeana.</page><page sequence="69">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 325 8.- &amp; )7 ^ CtW&lt;t ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~10 . .......

MUller Pls. 4; 5:9-14 This species has an essentially Arctic-alpine distribution in North America, and has been reported only a few times from the continent of North America. Polunin (1947) reports it from the northernmost part of Quebec (Wolstenholme), and from several points on Baffin Island; Schuster (1950) from Hudson Bay. Lepage (1945) reported it from the Rupert River in Central Quebec. The writer has found the species in the United States (tundra zone of Mt. Kathadin, Maine and Mt. Washington, New Hampshire). The present report, from the Lake Superior Region (Big Susie Island, Susie Islands, Cook Co.) marks a notable extension in range of the species. This is all the more remark- able because the species has, in Europe, a typical "Atlantic" distribution: occurring along the coast of Norway, east to Finland, and south to Great Britain. Questionable material of this species was found in one limited locality on Big Susie Island, on the cold, shaded, northwest facing crest of ledges at the edge of the lake. The crests of these ledges supported other Arctic-alpine species, such as L. (Orthocaulis) kun- zeana, Odontoschisma macounii, etc. The material of the present collection quite lacks gemmae, and has unusually spreading almost explanate leaves (P1. 5:10, 12). The plant is evidently a meso-hygrophytic modi- fication, is green throughout (e.g., lacks secondary pigmentation). However, the cells are strongly collenchymatous, with slightly bulging triganes. Robust sterile shoots show scat- tered underleaves: these consist in general of a single row of cells 3-5 cells long, ter- minated by a slime papilla, only occasionally of two such filaments that are connate at base (P1. 4:17-19). The less robust stems generally quite lack underleaves. The leaves on typical plants are on an average longer than wide, and are rather broadly obtrape- zoidal; on the present plants they are unusually narrow, except on robust shoots (thus approaching typical attenuata) (P1. 5:9, 10, 12, 14). The material of this collection was first considered to be gemmae-free attenuata. This seems impossible for the following reasons: the plants show the cells of the leaf-apices to be 19-22 , in diameter, with very distinct trigones (in attenuudta 13-17 ju, with con- cave trigones); many leaves, especially on less robust shoots are 2-lobed (P1. 5:12) (leaves almost uniformly 3-lobed in attenuata); small underleaves present (absent in attenuata) . When gemmae are present in this species, these occur also on terete shoots with reduced leaves. These shoots, however, are somewhat stouter and less filiform than in attenuata, and bear deep reddish-purple gemmae. In attenuata the gemmae are greenish, or in exposed sites, pale brownish. The present specimens are also quite similar to the Arctic-alpine L. binsteadii (which has leaves very similar to those of the present collection). According to Buch binsteadii never has underleaves; never has the cells over 19 Al in the leaf tips,* and has more deeply lobed leaves (divided 1/3 - 1/2, rather than 1/4 - 1/3).

Subgenus BARBILOPHOZIA Loeske The members of this subgenus can be recognized at once by the almost constantly 4-lobed, more or less horizontally spreading leaves (Pls. 5:1-3; 6:2). The stems are horizontal and creeping, and are provided ventrally with a dense felt-like mat of rhizoids (Pl. 5:1, 5): much as in Dilo- phozia. In the horizontal growth the subgenus differs from the other sub- genera and genera with more than 2-lobed leaves (Orthocaulis and Trito- * In the unusually spreading leaves, and in the frequent occurrence of scattered four- lobed leaves (P1. 5:10, 12), the present plants closely approach L.

The cells, also, are less strongly chlorophyllose, hence paler green.</page><page sequence="71">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 327 4110 14.~ ~ 4 6 (2N7 5. nJ 17 E18.6. 19.8 PLATE 4.

The relatively large size of the plants (1.5-5 mm wide and 2-10 cm long) makes their recognition in tllhe field quite simple: the four-lobed condition of the leaves can be seen with the naked eye and is quite diagnostic.* Two species occur in Minnesota, while a third occurs in nearby Michigan, and is to be looked for in our area. These three species are separable as follows: KEY TO SPECIES 1. Postical leaf-bases with distinct cilia (PI. 6:8), formed by several cells from 3-10 times as long as wide; underleaves present throughout, rather large, abundantly ciliate, with cilia like those of the postical leaf-base (P1. 6:3, 4); leaves normally with at least some of the lobes ending in mucronate tips (P1. 6:2-8) -.2 2. Leaves broadly rhomboid, 1.7-2.0 wider at apex than at base, 1.5-1.8 wider than long; leaf-lobes short, very broadly triangular; leaves strongly undulate-crispate: a clear whitish or yellow green; sinuses descending 1/5 - 1/4 (except the posti- cal sinus sometimes deeper); leafy shoots normally 4-5 mm wide and 4-8 cm long; gemmae rarely present - [L. lycopodioides] 2. Leaves subrhomboid to quadrate, slightly or moderately wider apically than at base, 1.2-1.7 wider than long (P1. 6:2, 8); leaf-lobes ovate-triangular, usually mucronate tipped; leaves flat or nearly, but often with the sinuses somewhat recurved (P1. 6:2, 8); sinuses descending 1/4 - 1/3 (except on gemmiparous leaves); leafy shoots normally 1.5-2.7 mm wide, pure deep green to brown or blackish brown, mostly 2-5 cm long; gemmae very common (P1. 6:7) .L. hatcheri 1. Postical leaf-bases unarmed; underleaves rare or none, small (P1. 5:4-5) and little ciliate or not at all ciliate (except near female inflorescence, where larger); leaves never mucronate tipped or apiculate (P1. 5 :1-3); gemmae absent; leaves symmetri- cal, with more or less ovate-triangular lobes (P1. 5 :1-3) -L. barbata LOPHOZIA (BARBILOPHOZIA) BARBATA (Schmid.) Dumort. P1. 5:1-8 This large, handsome species occurs throughout the entire Fir-Spruce Region, and very slightly into the Deciduous Forest Region, usually associated with cliffs or rock- exposures. It is a very abundant species, and one which the beginner can learn to know in the field almost at once. It has a wide ecological amplitude: occurring on loamy or rocky banks, on thinly soil-covered rocks, or almost as a pioneer on dry or moist rocks. The species has a wide tolerance as far as the pH of the substrate goes: it may occur under quite acid conditions on humus, but is more often common under more nearly circumneutral conditions, with the pH from 5.8-6.5. When the pH gets above 6.5 the species begins to drop out. On moist, shaded cliff-walls it may be associated with other Lophoziae (L. ventricosa, Anastrophyllum saxicolus, A. minutum, L. hatcheri, Tritomaria quinquedentata, L. attenuata) and with such species as Scapania nemorosa. Under rela- tively drier conditions, on soil on banks, it is occasional with such calciphytes as Tr. scitula. It also occurs, as a rarity in low, peaty areas among rocks, together with L. kun- zeana, but appears to be absent from all true bogs in our region. I have rarely found it associated with decaying logs, and find that in general, it begins to drop out when there is a thick layer of acid humus. The species is a meso-xerophyte, occurring only rarely under quite xeric conditions on vertical, shaded rock walls (with such species as A. minutum); under such conditions it tends to become very small in size, and develops a majority of leaves with only 2 or 3 lobes. * However, it must be emphasized that impoverished and juvenile plants, especially of L. barbata, show a large incidence of 3-lobed and 2-lobed leaves. Such plants could pos- sibly be mistaken for members of the subgenus Dilophozia. Fortunately, mature plants with predominantly 4-lobed leaves are almost invariably present.</page><page sequence="73">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 329 Normal materiaL of this species can be told in the field by the very large size of the pure-green to brown-green plants (2.8-5 mm wide x 3-6 or more cm long), and the very oblique and nearly horizontally inserted, shallowly 4-lobed leaves, which always spread in a nearly flat plane (P1. 5:1-3). Unlike in the distantly related L. hatcheri, the leaf- lobes are always obtuse or merely acute: never apiculate or mucronate, and the leaf-bases are not ciliate (P1. 5:1-3).

LOPHOZIA (BARBILOPHOZIA) HATCHERI (Evs.) Steph. P1. 6 This species is one of the characteristic forms of the upper edge of the coniferouLs forest atnd of the lower portions of the Tundra Region (Arctic-alpine Zone); it becomes progressively rarer as one goes southward into the Subarctic-Subalpine Coniferous Forest Region. It occurs in the northeastern corner of Minnesota at the southern periphery of its range and is to be considered as one of the rarities of the region. The species has a very interesting bipolar distribution: it was described from Patagonia and has been found wide- ly distributed in the Antarctic Region, while it is also widespread in the Arctic Region. Except for Isle Royale, the Keweenaw Peninsula and the Huron Mts. in Michigan, and the records reported below from Minnesota, the species has been found in the eastern United States only near the summits of the highest mountains of New England and New York. The species occurs in dense green (more rarely brownish-black) mats on north and northwest facing, moist cliffs (barely above the wave-action zone along Lake Superior), or their crevices, associated with such species as L. (Orthocaulis) attenuata, Scapania ncemorosa, and the superficially similar Tritomaria quinquedentata and L. (Barbilophozia) barbata. The pH range is from about 4.5-6.0. The species gives the impression of being either a pioneer on intermittently moist rocks, or of following directly on pioneer species. Confusion of this species is possible locally only with L. barbata and Tritomaria quin- quedentata. The usually mucronate-tipped leaf-lobes (P1. 6:2. 8) and the general abun- dant presence of reddish-brown gemmae (P1. 6:7), as well as the very large underleaves (P1. 6:3-4), and the cilia present at the postical leaf-base (P1. 6:8), will at once distin- guish the species from both of these. The four- (not three-) lobed and nearly symmetrical form of the leaves, all of which are nearly horizontally spreading, as well as the presence of reddish-brown gemmae, will distinguish it easily from Tr. quinquedentata. The three species are alt very robust and about equal in size and have similar or at least overlap- ping habitat requirements. This species is not easily separable from the very closely related L. lycopodioides, which occurs in northern Michigan and may possibly be expected in Minnesota. L. hatcheri differs from the latter in the smaller size (merely 1.5-2.7 mm wide), the green to brownish color (never whitish or yellowish green), and the scarcely undulate-crispate leaves, which never approach twice as wide as long. These differences are not always absolute, and confusion between the two species is easily possible. L. hatcheri usually has</page><page sequence="75">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 331 numerous gemmae, forming reddish-brown masses at the shoot-apices; in L. Iycopodioides the gemmae are absent or very few and sporadic in occurrence. The gemmae in L. hatch- eri may not only occur on the apices of the leaf-lobes (P1. 6:2), but also form at the ends of the cilia of the underleaves (P1. 6:4-6). The local collections are unusual in that the leaf-lobes are merely acute on many leaves: with at most the dorsal lobe mucronate; in this peculiarity the present species 3. 4.S N~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~N D'C~~~~~~1 7.7 8.

This large, magnificent, handsome species is one of the largest leafy liverworts in this region: well-developed plants being 4-5 mm wide and 5-8 cm long. It has been collected in northern Michigan, and is to be looked for in our area, either in deep, shaded Thuya swamps on logs, or on the upper crests of tall, moist, north-facing cliffs. The larger size, usually yellowish-green color, undulate-crispate leaves and absence of gemmae usually separate the species from hatcheri, to which it is very closely related. Subgenus LEIOCOLEA K. Miller Sterile material of the species of this subgenus is difficult to recognize in the field, but fertile plants can at once be separated from all other Hepaticae with bilobed leaves by the smooth, cylindrical perianths, whose apices are sud- denly constricted into a distinct beak, or rostellum (Pls. 7:1; 8:6-7). A similar beak occurs on the perianths of Jungermannia, but in that genus the leaves are entire. The members of this subgenus can be recognized on the collective basis of characters which do not occur in all species, however: leaves with larger cells, over 35 Ju (Pls. 7:3; 8:4-5), and with often bulging trigones (exc. badensis); cuticle with distinct, crowded papillae (P1. 7:3) (exc., usually, badensis); underleaves present (Pls. 7:4-5; 8:8-12) (exc. badensis); gemmae absent (exc. heterocolpa); occurring on calcareous substrates, and rarely on soil or decaying logs, never on peat. Living plants differ at once from those of other local groups of Lophoziaceae in that the oil-bodies are very large and occur only 2-5 per cell generally (Pls. 7:2-3; 8:4-5). The presence of underleaves will distinguish the species from Dilophozia (except L. badensis), but these may be small (in muelleri and gillmani) and visible only if the underside of the plant is studied with high power. The usually distinctly verrucose cuticle (P1. 7:3) also helps in distinguishing sterile material. Like Dilophozia, the plants grow flat on the ground, with the shoot apices scarcely ascending (exc. L. heterocolpa), but with the leaves spread even more strongly and horizontally than in Dilophozia, in which feature Leiocolea is clearly related to Barbilophozia. The leaves are little concave or may even be slightly convex above (P1. 7:1). The homogeneous medulla of the stem of Leiocolea may also be of some use in determining sterile specimens (P1. 7:8); in Dilophozia it is always dorsiventrally differentiated. As in the other genera with a horizontal mode of growth, the ventral side of the stem bears a dense mat of rhizoids (among which the underleaves may be very much hidden. Five species of this subgenus definitely occur in Minnesota. These may be identified by the subjoined key: * The development of mucronate leaf-lobes is correlated with presence of adequate moisture; xeromorphic, impoverished plants from dry sites (or collected in dry years) have the leaf-lobes often scarcely acute.</page><page sequence="77">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 333 KEY TO SPECIES 1.

(= rutheana Limpr.) P1. 7 A rare species of the Arctic-alpine and Subalpine Regions, occurring very rarely in the Deciduous Region (Schuster, 1949). In Minnesota the species appears to be con- fined to the eastern edge of the state along the North Shore of Lake Superior, and occurs here associated with peaty holes in calcareous intrusive rocks, or in marly bogs. Elsewhere the species is usually found in marly cedar bogs and swamps (Steere, 1937, for Michi- gan; Schuster, 1949, for central New York), associated with Moerkia hibernica or floto- wpiana, Riccardia multifida, Chiloscyphus pallescens, and Thuya. On the basic rocks of the Lake Superior shore the species is associated with such mesophytic epipetric "calci- philes" as L. (Leiocolea) gillmani and Tritomaria scitula, etc. There seems to be a very general correlation between its occurrence and that of the "calciphile" Potentilla fruticosa and Thuya, which occur with it at Bergen Swamp, N. Y. (See Schuster, 1949), as well as at Grand Marais. The species is generally a hygrophyte, but appears to be a meso- phyte where occurring on moist rocks. I have found the species to have a wide tolera- tion for extremes of light: occurring in open marl bogs, as well as in dense shade, under Thuyd. The species is to be looked for in the Thuya swamps in northern Minnesota, where it should be found more frequently, with Riccardia pinguis and multifida and Moerkia. The very large size of this magnificent species, with well-developed plants 4-5 mm wide and 6-8 cm long, will alone suffice to separate it from other species of the genus. Confusion is most likely with L. gillmani, which barely approaches it in size. L. schultZii differs from the latter, as well as other species of Leiocolea, in the very large, multifid and ciliate underleaves (P1. 7:4-5), some of which are more than half the length of the leaves. The leaves in this species are also characteristically dorsally convex and widest near the base and much wider than long on robust shoots (P1. 7:1, 6, 7); they may have * Some forms of L. muelleri are no larger than badensis: their separation is discussed on p. 339.</page><page sequence="78">334 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) one or several small cilia near the postical base (reminiscent of the allied subgenus Barbi- lophozia).

His collections should be re-examined. The Grand Portage material is typical, however, and the plate was prepared from this collection. It should be noted, as is evident from P1. 7:1, that the perichaetial bracts of this species may serve also as antheridial bracts. As in L. gillmani, some plants appear to be devoid of antheridia, but androecia never occur on separate branches or plants. Lophozia (Leiocolea) gilimani (Aust.) comb. n. P1. 8:5-12 Jungermannia gillmani Aust., Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 3:12, 1872. This rather large, Subarctic to Arctic-alpine species occurs in some abundance through- out the region along the edge of Lake Superior wherever basic rock outcrops occur and mesic conditions prevail. The species ranges northward into the Arctic-alpine Zone, but is totally unknown from the Deciduous Zone. In Minnesota this species and L. hetero- colpa are the common species of Leiocolea, the present species occurring under more decidedly calcareous conditions than L. heterocolpa. L. gillmani is either a pioneer on moist calcareous rocks, often in the "spray-moistened" zone, along the lake-shore, usually in crevices (i.e., as a chasmophyte), or spreading from the crevices over the surrounding, soil-free, plane surfaces. It is here often a secondary species, appearing to invade after ecesis of such primary mosses as Gymnostomum aeruginosum, etc., among the mats of which the isolated plants of the Leiocolea may creep. When seen under such conditions, the plants of the Leiocoiea usually stand out because of their shining pale green appear- ance. The measured pH range of the species is 5.5-7.1; the species is under all conditions a mesophyte, occurring usually (on thin, soil-covered rocks, or in rock crevices) with such "calciphiles" as L. (Leiocolea) badensis, Scapania gymnostomophila, Sc. cuspiduligera, Odontoschisma macounii, Tritomaria scitula, Preissia, etc. Around the edges of exposed rock pools it occasionally occurs with Sc. degenii and 0. macounii, and the "calciphile" Selaginella selaginoides, Primulla, and Pinguicula. The intermediate size of this species (2-4 mm wide x 1.5-4 cm long), the presence of discrete underleaves, and the paroecious inflorescence (with antheridia in the leaves below the perianth) will serve to separate tlhe species from our other Leiocolea species, except L. schultzii (which see).* The species often bears isolated plants in which antheridia do not develop in the axils of the leaves below the perianths. Such plants appear to be very similar to L. muelleri and bantryensis and not sharply separable from them (except perhaps by the cell-size).f In gillmani, however, the perianth is distinctly more longly beaked than in muelleri (P1. 8:6, 7). In the writer's experience, study of a mat of fertile plants of L. gillmani almost always shows some plants that lack antheridial bracts below the perianth; yet do not show androecia on separate plants, but show them on at least a few plants with perianths. Such mats, I believe, do not represent an admixture of muelleri and gillmani, but are to be referred to gillmani.

The species is often a pioneer on moist vertical sandstone and calcareous shale cliffs, especially on the shaded north facing sides, or invades soon after colonization of such cliffs by such mosses as Gymnostomum aeruginasum and curvirostrum, among the dense mats of which it very frequently occurs as isolated trailing stems. The species is a mesophyte like our other species of Leiocolea, not occurring on rocks that are periodically dry, rarely on rocks constantly wet because of spray or seepage. The species is most frequently a chasmophyte, at least in the early stages of ecesis, and then spreads to the totally bare surrounding plane rock surfaces. Commonly associated species are Lophozia (Leiocolea) gillmani, Tritomaria scitula, Scapania gymnostomophila, Pellia fabbroniana, Riccardia pinguis, and occasionally the thallose Marchantiales, such as Preissia, Mannia rupestris and pilosa. This species is difficult to recognize until its habitat requirements are recognized, after which it may usually be recognized by its occurrence alone. It is smaller and more delicate than our other species of Leiocolea* (or the similar a'pearing LophoZid ventricosa, etc.), rarely becoming 10 mm long and usually with the stem delicate and translucent. It differs at once from the other species of Leiocolea in totally lacking all trace of underleaves (though these may be very small in muelleri and gillmani). When fertile the terete, beaked perianths, the dioecious inflorescence, combined with the lack of underleaves are sufficient to separate it at once from other species of Leiocolea. The lack of gemmae on sterile material will generally separate the species from other forms of Lophozia, as well as the superficially similar Lophocolea minor. Unlike our other species of Leiocoled, the cells of badensis are usually very delicate and lack distinct trigones (P1. 8:4). Wihen living plants are available, they can easily be separated from most other bilobed species of Hepaticae by the very large, granular-appear- ing oil-bodies, which occur usually 2-6 per cell (P1. 8:4). Similar oil-bodies occur in our other species of Leiocolea. Distribution.-COOK: Grand Marais, C 2683, C 2668. HoUSTON: 3 mi. s. of La Crescent, S. LAKE: Lower falls of Manitou R., S 18092. ST.

It occurs here on moist, shaded to rather exposed rocks, associated most frequent- ly with other lime-tolerating species such as Tritomaria scitula and Tr. quinquedentata, Odontoschisma micounii, Scapania gymnostomophila, etc. The species is less distinctly a calciphyte than the related gillmani (or any other species of Leiocolea). It generally invades calcareous rocks considerably after ecesis of pioneer species, after preparation of the substrate and deposition of considerable humus materials: i.e., at a later period, successionally, than the pioneer species.

This is our only species with bilobed leaves (except for the very different Anastrophyllum hellerianum and minu- tum) to produce erect, terete gemmiparous shoots. It differs from all such forms with erect shoots and lobed leaves in the presence of underleaves, and in the larger size (to 3 mm wide). Occasionally the plants occur under relatively xeric conditions on banks (associated with Odontoschisma macounii, etc.) and then may produce the gemmiparous shoots rarely or not at all. Such impoverished plants often have the leaves rather imbricate and con- cave, and have (like most collections), very large and often reddish-brown or brownish trigones. Such plants may be confused with other species of Leiocolea (but differ in the smaller cells of the lobes, which are generally only 18-24 At) or with Lophozia porphyro- leuca (from which they differ in the distinctly papillose cuticle and presence of under- leaves). The underleaves are lanceolate and usually quite obvious, much as in Harpan- thus scutatus. Distribution.-CARLTON: Thompson, C 2441A.

This species is widespread in Europe, but has been reported only a very few times from North America. Most of the North American reports cited are incorrect, therefore the actual North American distribution is quite unknown. The species appears to have a wide distribution at low and medium elevation, and becomes rare north of the Coniferous Zone. Conklin (1929) doubtfully reports it from the Lake Superior shore in Wisconsin. In Minnesota the species has been found several times on the moist sandstone cliffs below the "Sugarloaf," at Winona and on a bluff above Wabasha City; it was here in abundant fruit on May 9, 1948. Associated species were Preissia quadrata, Manlia sibirica and rupest7is. The species occurred under obviously calcareous and relatively xeric conditions. So far, it has not been found north of the southeastern corner of the state. This species is most apt to be mistaken for L. badensis, which it often resembles in the small size (0.5 mm wide and 8-15 mm long), when occurring under exposed xeric conditions. In fact, the material referred to muelleri was at first considered to be L. bad- ensis, and was separated from it only with microscopic examination. Under the microscope muelleri differs from badensis in the smaller leaf-cells (25 or 30 ,u in the leaf-lobes or even less), which usually show distinct if small trigones; in the presence of minute under- leaves, that are often somewhat obscured by the rhizoids (but are present on all sterile plants); and in the tendency for the female bracts to be more or less sparsely dentate on the margins. In the present collection androecia were abundantly present: these are char- acterized by their spike-like, relatively compact form, with the individual bracts strongly saccate, and closely approximated to imbricate. The plants from the Minnesota localities all belong to the small form, fo. pumiflla Nees: these are characterized by more or less imbricate, erect-spreading leaves, and often by the presence of slight pigmentation. Confu- sion is possible, otherwise, only with L. gillmani: which differs at once in the paroecious inflorescences, and in the long beak of the perianth-mouth (the beak is very short in both badensis and muelleri).

Schuster This subgenus was recently proposed (K. MMuller, 1939) to include those species of Lophozia with numerous (20-50 per cell) oil-bodies, of small size (2-4 pu). In critically studying this subgenus I found that the stem structure was also very unlike that occurring in Dilophozia (Schuster, 1949): there was no trace of a ventral band of smaller medullary cells (Pls. 10: 8; 11: 9; 13: 1 ), unlike in Dilopbozia.* In addition to these two fundamental characters, sev- eral other less constant features separate Massula from Dilophozia: a tendency towards larger cells, which are always thin-walled (Pls. 12:8; 13:2, 7) or with the walls equally thick-walled (P1. 11:7-8), i.e., the leaf-cells lack tri- gones; the female bracts as well as the male bracts with the lobes often more or less dentate or spinose-dentate (this, in some species, may extend to the leaves of sterile shoots, as in L. incisa and grandiretis (Pls. 11:11; 10:6); a tendency to have the leaves wider than long, delicate, flaccid and undulate, with occasional leaves with 3-4-lobes (Pls. 10:4, 6; 11:2-4, 11; 12:5). In some of these characters, as well as in the homogeneous structure of the medulla of the stem, Massula is similar to Isopaches. Isopaches, however, has fewer oil-bodies (10-12 per cell, 4-9 ji long), as in Dilophozia. It is thus evident that Isopaches connects these otherwise very distinct subgenera. It is doubtful whether to recognize Isopaches, but if the two species included in it are included in either Dilophozia or Massula, then these subgenera will lose some of the distinctnless they now have. Dry material of the members of this subgenus cannot usually be identified directly to subgenus, unless stem cross-sections are made. The homogeneous medulla will separate the species from Dilophozia, but not from Isopaches. Living plants are best recognized by the very small (1.5-4 /i usually) oil- bodies, which occur in large numbers per cell (Pls. 11:7-8; 12:8; 13:7). In most cases the absence of trigones in the leaf-cells will separate the species from Dilophozia. However, xeric forms of at least one species (L. incisa) may produce markedly knot-like, bulging trigones. KEY TO SPECIES 1.

[L. obtusa] LoPHOZIA (MASSULA) OBTUSA (Lindb.) Evs. P1. 10: 1-8 This species is occasional in the lower parts of the Arctic-alpine Zone, and the upper portion of the Subarctic. It has not yet been found in Minnesota but will probably be found in the vicinity of Lake Superior. Steere (1937) has reported it for the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan. This species possesses a very anomalous combination of characters and has therefore been very variously placed (see Schuster, 1949; Muller, 1939). Its position in Massula is by no means certain, but it has more characters in common with this subgenus than any other. Ihe most characteristic feature are the bilobed leaves with rounded or obtuse leaf-lobes and strongly reflexed, gibbose sinuses; occasional leaves are 3-lobed. The leaves, as in Leiocoiea (where it was placed by Buch, 1933), are very obliquely inserted and spread horizontally; as in most species of Leiocolea (but unlike any species of Massula) the cuticle may be slightly papillose. As in Massula the leaves are as wide or wider than long, have virtually non-collenchymatous cells, while the stems lack a ventral band of smaller, narrower cells: the perianth lacks a beak, as in Massula, and is plicate aboive (thus quite unlike in Leiocolea). The chief character that would serve to place it in Leiocolea is the cuticle, but the numerous small oil-bodies are very unlike those found in Leiocolea, but very much' like those of Massula. It is therefore apparent that the vast majority of characters are shared with Massula, and Miiller's (1939) disposition of the species here seems essentially correct. LoPHOZIA (MASSULA) GRANDIRETIS (Lindb.) Schiffn. Pls. 11; 12:1-5 This extremely rare, essentially Arctic-alpine species occurs as a subcalciphyte on northwest facing banks along the North Shore of Lake Superior, and occasionally in marly bogs (as at Grand Portage).* It frequents somewhat peaty soil directly over cal- careous ledges, associated with Odontoschisma macounii, Blepharostoma, Scapania nemo. rosa, Geocalyx, etc.,-under pH of about 6.5 to a lower extreme of 5.5. Associated vascu- lar plants are Primulla mistassinica and Pinguicula vulgaris. The species has a decided preference for north and northwest facing, relatively shaded and sheltered exposures, and occurs in our area as a meso-xerophyte. In marl bogs it occurs with Lophozia schukzii, Riccardia pinguis, R. multifida, Moerkia, and Chiloscyphus pallescens. The species occurs on ledges often as a dense-leaved, pigmented modification that produces gemmae in extraordinary abundance (P1. 11:1). The plants form small, almost rosette-like patches, of small extent, of which the stems are a deep reddish-black (P1. 12:3) and the older leaves have a similar but less intense reddish pigmentation.

These small patches are very characteristic and apparent even at some distance, the gemmiparous shoot-apices standing out conspicuously from the much darker substrate and older portions of the plants. The species is to be recognized at once by the very large leaf-cells, 40-60 Alb and even more in diameter in the leaf-middle (Pls. 11:7-8; 12:1-2) with scarcely evi- dent trigones, and by the broad leaves, which are at least 1.25 as wide as long, and shallowly divided into two short lobes by a broad often crescentic sinus (P1. 11:2-6, 11); occasional, especially upper leaves are 3-lobed. The 1-2-celled yellow-green, angulate or stellate gemmae (P1. 11:10) and the irregular, more or less undulate leaves (P1. 11:1) are quite typical. On moister, less exposed peaty ledges (as on Belle Rose I.) the species is green throughout, except for the stems, which are purplish beneath. When the species grows in bogs it often forms a more lax-leaved modification, in which the stems are largely or entirely green (mod. viridis). In all of these forms the dense gemmae-masses of the shoot apices occur: one of the best field characters of the species. The plants share with the distantly related L. incisa a somewhat similar facies, and a distinctly fleshy texture. However, the two species are very distinct, and rarely occur together. L. grandiretis seems confined to somewhat calcareous substrates; L. incisa is a very pronounced oxylophyte. At the single site where I have found the species consoci- ated (at Belle Rose I.), the two were obviously distinct, even to the naked eye.

LOPHOZIA (MASSULA) INCISA (Schrad.) Dumort. P1. 12:6-10 Throughout the Subarctic-Subalpine Zone, and southward slightly into the Deciduous Zone, and northward to a limited extent into the Arctic-Alpine Zone. The species is fre- quent or common in the Spruce-Fir Region in Minnesota, but extends only slightly into the Deciduous Forest Region. This species is an extreme oxylophyte, occurring only on quite to very acid substrata: it is therefore almost constantly limited to two types of habi- tats: decaying moist logs, and peat or peaty soil very high in humic acids. On decaying logs it grows associated with several Cephalozia species (catenulata, lacinulata, media) wvith Lophozia porphyroleuca, Scapania umbrosa, apiculata and glaucocephala; it is, on logs, limited to shaded, moist or almost wet, greatly decayed logs, and therefore is not a pioneer species on them in most cases. On peaty banks it is definitely not pioneer and is usually associated with Calypogeia sphagnicola, Odontoschisma denudatum, Mylia anoma- la, Lophozia ventricosa mod. coloratd-pachyderma, Cephalozia species (pleniceps, media, bicuspidata, leucantha), and with Lepidozia reptans and Blepharostoma. The measured pH range on peaty banks (usually at the crest of northwest facing ledges and cliffs, where there is considerable seepage) is from 3.9 to 4.8. The species is able to exist on considerably exposed sites where there is a high incidence of direct light, if the substrate is moist enough. Although often found with Sphagnum on peaty ledges, it never occurs on Sphagnum in bogs. This species is one of the easiest of the Lophoziaceae to learn to recognize in the field: the plants are small (0.5-1 cm long) and form dense patches whose pale opaque bluish-green color is very characteristic. The crowded, crispate wavy leaves, the lobes of which are acute to acuminate (P1. 12:6, 10), and often supplied with supplementary teeth or lobes will suffice to separate it from all our other species.* The restricted occur- rence of the species will also aid in its identification. Under the microscope the densely * The plants from which Figs. 6, 9 and 10 were taken are reduced, juvenile forms. On robust plants the leaves are more undulate-crispate, and become wider than long.

Muller (1950, p. 356) has shown that L. mildeana is a synonym of 1. capitata Hooker. The type of J. capitata is from England, and the English plants figured by Jones (1950, p. 354, fig. 1) are gemmiparous, with the gemmae in small heads (giving the species its name) at the tips of attenuated shoots. I have seen no nearctic material with gemmae formation correlated with such obvious etiolation of the shoots, and there- fore wonder if the nearctic material is clearly cospecific with the palearctic. The English plants had for many years been considered as cospecific with Lophozi.i excisa, with which a superficial resemblance exists. However, the species differs from L. excisa in the following important characters: 1) gemmae nearly spherical, circa 20 A, pale green; 2) leaf-cells 35-50 JA, each with at least 18-20 small globular oil-bodies; 3) leaves and perianth (and occasionally the whole plant) suffused with reddish to reddish-violet pigmentation, except when growinig in unusually shaded sites; 4) leaves very variable, the more robust ones of sterile shoots commonly 3.4-lobed, much wider than long; 5) stems with medulla not becoming mycorrhizal. t I have examined the Iowa specimen (Moore Station, Poweshick Co., wet shaded bank, April 15, 1946, H. S. Conard) and find it typical "mildeana," mixed with Cepha- loziella rubella,</page><page sequence="91">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 347 relatively dry Chamaedaphne heaths, over sand, in Jack Pine barrens. It is now possible to add several stations from Minnesota, marking the northwest peripheral points in the l-nown distribution of the species. The species occurs in two distinct types of sites: on inorganic compact soils (sand, or loam or clay) in moist, sunny ditches, or on wet, shaded banks, or on such soil at the edges of marshes, associated with Cephaloziella sp. (rubella, etc.) and occasionally Sca- pania irrigua or nemorosa. The species recurs again in sphagnum bogs, under much more moist conditions, associated (as at the first Minnesota locality) with such members of the Mylia associule as Cladopodiella fluitans, Cephaloziella elachista, Calypogeid sphagnicola, etc. Under such conditions, the species occurs exactly as does the extremely similar L. marchica.* The species shares with L. marchica and L. grandiretis the large, very thin-walled and pellucid leaf-cells (averaging over 40 ,u in leaf-middle), the very numerous, minute, homo- geneous oil-bodies, the elongate stem-cells (mostly 4-8 times as long as wide, and usually averaging much narrower than the basal leaf-cells), as well as the irregular, somewhat wavy leaves that are 2-3 or even irregularly 4-lobed. It is not likely to be mistaken for other species. Unlike L. grandiretis, which may also occur in bogs (but usually kcss acid bogs), the leaf-cells rarely average over 40-48 x 45-56 ,u in the leaf-middle, and the tinderside of the stem is never purplish; like L. grandiretis, however, the leaves often exhibit a distinct reddish or vineous-red pigmentation. The most obvious difference be- tween capitata and grandiretis lies in the gemmae, however: these are angulate and stellate in grandiretis, but ovoid and smooth in capitata (P1. 10:9), as in marchica. The species is undoubtedly most closely allied to L. marchica, with which it shares the same type of gemmae and the cell-size. However, the pigmentation of the two species is quite different: in capitata the leaves (and perianths) tend to become reddish pigmented, with the leaf-apices first showing such pigmentation; in marchica the postical side of the stem is always purplish pigmented, while the leaves remain bright green (at most exhibit- ing a little purplish at the base, where they join the stem). The material from Jaynes is extremely sparse: consisting merely of 4 or 5 individual plants. These show all the typical features of capitata, however, including the green ven- tral side of the stem, somewhat reddish leaves, and the ovoid gemmae. The latter are gtcenish, and 19-23 ,u; the most mature ones are atypical in that they are somewhat vineous red pigmented (P1. 10:9). The Anoka Co. material is more abundant.

P1. 13 Throughout the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, to the edge of the Deciduous Zone and well into the Arctic-alpine Zone, in peat bogs and on moors. The present species is to be found in many of the better developed, more open Sphagnum bogs of the region. It occurs here largely along the deer trails or holes in the bogs, on the vertical sides or the wet bases of which it may form considerable patches. Often it occurs only as small iso- lated mats, and may be overlooked. The associated species, outside of Sphagnum and the layer of Ericaceous shrubs (Ledum, Chamaedaphne, Rhododendron, etc.) are such Hepati- cae as Mylia anomala, Cladopodiella fluitans, Calypogeia sphagnicola, Cephaloziella cea- chista, and such Cephalozia species as connivens and pleniceps. More rarely (and usually in the wettest places) Scapania irrigua and paludicola may occur with it. The species occurs only in bogs that are quite acid: it has a very low tolerance for lime, and also is an early invading species, when conditions are still quite wet. By the time that the bog-level is raised and the bog forest becomes dense, and such mesophytes as Lophocolea heterophylla invade, the Lophozia has begun to disappear. This is one of our easier species to identify: the pure or grass-green color, except * L. capitata, however, occurs more frequently in heaths or boggy depressions in sandy, otherwise dry regions. It is common in Chamaedaphne heaths in the Jack Pine regions -f northern Michigan.</page><page sequence="92">348 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) for the purplish underside of the stem (and rhizoids) are enough to separate it from any other Lophozia species that may occur in bogs (such as L. ventricosa). It has very characteristic, lax, rather distant, 2-4-lobed, very irregular an] -.s--vy leaves with reflexed sinuses that are quite diagnostic of the species (P1. 13 :4-5). The very oblique leaf- insertion, the large cells with thin walls (P1. 13 :2-7) (38-45 jt or longer), and the absence of underleaves will separate it from other species with which it might be con- fused. The very similar lax forms of L. grandiretis are separable because of the much larger leaf-cells (many between 60-80 ,u long), and the usually more extensive reddish pigmentation: furthermore, grandiretis is "calciphilous," while L. marchica is strictly an extreme oxylophyte. The very similar L. capitata is to be looked for in peaty and moory places around sand dunes. It has usually extensive reddish pigmentation of leaves and perianths, and has the stem greenish, with the underside never purplish as in marchica. All three of these species normally have the stem-cells very narrow and long (averag- ing 3-8 times as long as wide); the stem-cells, furthermore, are usually only about half as wide as the basal leaf-cells (compare P1. 13:2 and 3). In the narrow and long cells of the cortex of the stem (which always have very thin walls), the species differ consider- ably from Ddlophozia. Distribution.-COOK: Pigeon River, C 2650.

Muller This subgenus agrees in most of its characters with Massula: dentate male and female bracts (P1. 14:2), uniform medulla of the stem (P1. 14:8), non- collenchymatous leaf-cells (P1. 12:3-4), leaves as wide or wider than long (Pl. 14:7), but has moderate-sized oil-bodies (4-9 ft long), which occur about 9-12 per cell (P1. 14:3-4). In the nature of the oil-bodies the subgenus is definitely similar to Dilophozia. Isopaches, with the two species included in it (I. bi- crenata, decolorans) thus is in some ways annectant between the two sub- genera. The sole local species has the cell-walls (at least of the upper leaves and bracts) quite to very thick-walled, with the lumens of the cells rounded, and appearing like drops (hence guttulate) (P1. 14:3-4). In this it differs from all our species of both Dilophozia and Massula, although some species of the latter subgenus (grandiretis, for example) may have the cells somewhat equally thick-walled. In Isopaches the capsules are abundantly produced. These offer a rather sharp differentiating feature. The wall is formed of two cell-layers, of which both outer and inner layers have semiannular brown bands of thickening (P1. 14:10, 11). In our other Lophozioid species (except for the very different Gymnocolea) the inner cell-layer has complete, annular, band-like thickenings. LOPHOZIA (ISOPACHES) BICRENATA (Schmid.) Dumort.

It is fairly common in the eastern states on loamy and clayey, compact soils, usually asso- ciated with cliffs, but occasionally occurs in moist depressions on sandy soils around bogs and swamps.

In Minnesota the species is nearly or quite absent from similar sites in the Deciduous Zone, but occurs, occasionally, associated with soil-covered rock-outcrops or in rock-crevices in the northern part of the state. The species is usually associated with sandy-loamy soils, that have either been largely leached of lime or are quite free of it: the pH is generally from 6.0 to 5.0 or less; the species is frequent on acid sterile soils of fields, together with such indicators of acid sterile conditions as Polytrichum and X2.~~~~~~~~~~~2 0 PLATE 1-3.

The very thick-walled cells, especially under very xeric conditions (P1. 14:3-4), the occurrence on acid, sterile habitats, and the paroecious inflorescence (with the bracts and the leaves below the female bracts concave and always distinctly dentate (P1. 14:2) are highly characteristic. Perianths are always developed in abundance, and have a distinctly ciliate-dentate mouth (P1. 14:6) (which at once separates the species from L. excisa). The species occurs under similar conditions as L. excisa, and like it is a small (1 cm or less long), fleshy plant. Gemmae are borne very abundantly and gemmiparous plants usually have lacerated, erose, irregular leaves (P1. 14:1); such gemmiparous plants are quite characteristic of the species (and are not developed in excisa, in which gemmae are usually rather scarce). In bicrenata many cells of the leaf-lobes appear dead and lack oil-bodies (P1. 14:4). Finally, in bicrenata the stem is less robust, and only 8-9 cells high (P1. 14:8), with no development of a distinct ventral, mycorrhizal "band": in excisa the stem is 15-22 cells high or more, with the ventral half of the medulla of somewhat smaller cells, many of which are destroyed by fungal activity in mature stems (P1. 15:7). Both species agree in having orbicular leaves, with a shallow, lunate sinus (P1. 15:3). Distribution.-CARLTON: Thompson, C 652, C 910. COOK: Grand Portage, S 11494; Pigeon River, C 2522.

ST. Louis: Oneota Ravine, Duluth, C 2522. Subgenus DILOPHOZIA K. MIuller This subgenus includes eight or more species in Minnesota, depending on how narrow a species concept is followed. Several forms that are often recog- nized (longiflora, guttulata, silvicola) occur, but these may be mere forms of other species. Whatever treatment of the species is attempted, the group is still very difficult, unless an extremely conservative treatment of species is maintained. The subgenus is to be recognized at once by the more or less distinct development of a ventral band of small, narrow, elongate cells in the interior of the stem, which soon become disorganized because of the growth of mycor- rhizal fungi (PIs. 15:7; 18:8). This feature, unfortunately, is much less sharply developed than Buch (1933, 1942) maintains, and in such species as L. ascendens is scarcely evident (PI. 16:7). The subgenus may be confused with other groups with bilobed leaves, but most of these (Geocalyx, Harpan- thus, Lophocolea) have distinct underleaves, which are totally lacking in Dilo- phozia. From the other subgenera of Lophozia with bilobed leaves distinction is sometimes difficult. The ovate leaves, usually no or scarcely wider than long (PIs. 18:5; 21:2-4), usually with distinct trigonous thickenings of the cell-walls (PIs. 16:3; 17:3, 5; 18:4), are rathcr characteristic, as well as their oblique (but not horizontal) manner of insertion. The pleated perianth, with no traces of a beak (PI. 18:1), and the smooth cuticle, and many (6-25) moderate-sized oil-bodies, and lack of underleaves separate Dilopbhozia from Leiocolea. Distinction from Massula and Isopaches is more difficult. The larger oil-bodies, 4-9 ji long (PIs. 17:3, 5, 8; 18:4), and their fewer number * On cliffs these species often occur with L. bicrenata, as well as Lopho,-ia silvicola, 7Zritomaria exsectiformis and other oxylophytic species.</page><page sequence="95">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 351 5. 6.0 9.

Dumort. P1. 15 This species has a wide distribution in the subarctic-subalpine and northernmost portions of the Deciduous Regions, ranging north somewhat into the Arctic-alpine Zone. In Minnesota it is found throughout that part of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone in which rock outcrops occur, as well as in the eastern edge of the Deciduous Zone. The species is very variable, and occurs under a wide variety of circumstances, but occurs always asso- ciated with mineral substrates: either acid sandy or loamy soils, over rock outcrops, or directly on rock surfaces, occasionally on loamy banks away from rock outcrops. The species has a wide toleration for variation in pH, occurring occasionally on subcalcareous sandstones, with a pH of about 7.0,t as well as on basic intrusive rocks, and on more acid intrusive rocks, where the pH may be as low as 4.8. Under most cases the species is a pioneer or invades soon after other species. On sheltered, relatively dry to slightly moist rock walls it invades after previous preparation by lichens (Peltigera, etc.), and may then be the only liverwort present; it persists here until ferns (often Polypodium) come in. The large leaf-cells, the usually rather deep, pure-green color (reddish-tinged where exposed), the thin cell-walls that lack trigones (P1. 15:2, 5), and the orbicular leaves with a broad sinus descending only ?/ (P1. 15:3), characterize the species.

The latter species, furthermore, is more often strongly reddish pigmented, and has abundant reddish-brown gemmae.* * L. excisa is also very closely related to L. latifolia, with which it shares a similarly crenulate perianth-mouth, broad leaves, the relatively large cells of the leaf-lobes, the in- ability to produce prominent trigones, and purplish gemmae. However, in L. latifolia the leaves are wider than is normally the case in L. excisa (often 1.25 as wide as long or more), and L. latifolia is clearly, and apparently uniformly, dioecious. 2. 4. 00 ~~~ ~~0C 0 4ND ~6. 61,5a00 00 9.~~~~~~~K 7.~~~~~~~~~I PLATE 15.

Macoun Pls. 17:1-3; 19:1-8 Distributed throughout most of the Spruce-Fir Climax Region, but not at all south of it. The species occurs largely under two types of conditions: on shaded to moderately exposed, relatively dry, vertical rocks and ledges, usually in shaded forests, often accom- panied by Lophozia ventricosa, L. (Barbilophozia) barbata, Tritomaria quinquedentata, and on relatively exposed logs and stumps, here associated with the epixylic species, such as Ptilidium pulcherrimum, Lophozia porphyroleuca, Calypogeia suecica, Tritomaria ex- sectiformis, etc. As far as local distribution is concerned, the relatively "Canadian" distri- bution is characteristic; the species occurs always associated with well-developed coniferous forests, and as the exposed, treeless lake-shore is approached, nearly disappears. Locally, at least, the species is quite "calcifuge," with a pH preferendum between 5.5 and 4.5. This is one of the easiest of the Lophoziae to recognize in the field: the strict, slender, erect or strongly ascending shoots, with relatively narrow, ovate to subrectangular leaves (always obviously longer than wide, P1. 17:2) that are erect or erect-spreading, and appear nearly transversely inserted, at once separate it from all our species, except L. ascendens. It differs from the latter by its generally larger size (many of the shoots be- coming 0.8-2 cm long), and by the reddish-brown color of the gemmae.* Because of the color of the latter it will at once be separated from ventricosa and its allies, with which it frequently grows. The long-ciliate perianth-mouth (P1. 17:1) is also very characteristic of this species and of L. ascendens. The female bracts (unlike in other species, except for ascendens and excisa) have more or less dentate lobes. Living material can be told most easily from the closely related ascendens by the oil- bodies, which are composed of numerous, slightly protuberant oil-globules (PI. 17:3) (in ascendens nearly smooth, with scarcely protruding oil-globules that are very difficultly perceptible under the oil-immersion lens). At times the distinction between this species and ascendens is difficult to maintain since juvenile gemmae (and gemmae of strongly shaded plants) are only slightly pig- mented in longidens. Generally, L. longidens forms deep green patches, while L. ascen dens is paler, more yellowish-green. As is pointed out in Schuster (1952), L. longidens, even when growing in shade, has the mature gemmae reddish-brown, while (even in sun- light), the vegetative portions do not develop any reddish secondary pigmentation. The repeated occurrence of the two species, growing side by side, demonstrates that two distinct species are at hand.

P1. 16 SPHENOLOBUS ASCENDENS Warnstorf, Hedwigia 57: 63, Fig. 2, 1916. This species appears to be strictly limited to the Subarctic-subalpine zone, or Coniferous Panclimax, of Europe and eastern North America. As has been pointed out by Schuster (1952), the distribution of the species is uncertain because of earlier confti- sion with various other species of Lophozia (L. longidens, porphyroleuca especially). Since its description (1916) it was neglected, until redescribed by Buch (1933c) as L. gracil- lima. It was first reported by Schuster (1951), under this latter name, from North Amer- ica. Subsequent study has revealed its presence in a belt running from Maine to New York, westward to Michigan, Ontario and Minnesota. It will probably prove transconti- nental. The southernmost station in North America lies in the Catskill Mountains, New York (Cornell Mt., in Spruce Forest, Schuster, 1952). The species is locally highly restricted in occurrence to the early stages of decaying, decorticated logs and stumps in more or less shaded Spruce-Fir forests. Here it is associ- ated almost invariably with one or several of the following species: Jamesoniella autum- nalis, Blepharostoma trichophyllum, Scapania apiculata, Scapania glaucocephala, Ptiliditum pulcherrimum, A. (Crossocalyx) hellerianum, and Lophocolea heterophylla. The species is a decided "calciphobe" occurring only on organic substrates (unlike the very closely related L. longidens), and occurs under a measured pH of 4.6-5.2. It was sharply sepa- rated from L. longidens only as recently as 1933. It differs from the latter in that the plants are often smaller: merely 0.7-1.1 mm wide and from 2-3.5, rarely 8-10, mm high, and in that the gemmae are greenish yellow instead of reddish or reddish-brown, and are somewhat smaller in size.* These differences are relatively slight. The most obvious features of the species are shared by longidens: the erect to strongly ascending growth (P1. 16:1, 6), with the leaves decidedly narrower than long, subrectangular, with rather long, horn-like lobes (P1. 16:9), and with the insertion virtually but not quite transverse dorsally. The ascending type of growth and narrow leaves will at once separate these two species from the other species of Lophozid. Tihis species differs from L. longidens in general facies. In the field the pale to yellow,green color (reminiscent more of juvenile plants of L. incisa) is quite distinctive. Under exposed conditions the plants may acquire a reddish or reddish-brown secondary pigmentation, except for the gemmae; this pigmentation is most often distinct on the androecia, which may be reddish even when the rest of the plants are yellow-green. Occa- sionally the species is very difficult to separate from the mod. parvifolia of L. silvicola. The latter may show an ascending (but never suberect) growth, and has leaves nearly as narrow as those of L. ascendens. Sterile material of the latter must be separated witl care from ascendens. Evans (1917) synonymized L. ascendens under L. porphyroleuca. The species was not again recognized until 1933, when Buch redescribed it under the name L. gracillima. The writer recently (Schuster, 1952) was able to show that Sphenolobus ascendens Wstf. and L. gracillima Buch were identical. Buch (in litt.) fully concurs in this opinion.

The form has been studied critically in material from the Great Palisade, Lake Co.. associated with Odontoschisma denudatum, Bazzania trilobata, Mylia anomala, Lophozia attenuata, Lepidozia reptans, and Cephalozia media, occurring in a mod. colorata-mesoder- nia. The oil-bodies occurred mostly 16-20 per cell (P1. 17:5, 8) with as many as 25 in some cells of the leaf-middle, while somewhat below average-sized cells had only about 13 oil-bodies. In all of the oil-bodies near the surface (i.e., without intervening chloro- plasts) the structure could be seen fairly clearly, though much of the detail was beyond the resolution of the oil-immersion system. The oil-bodies, which were mostly 4-6.5 ,O in diameter (a few attaining 7.2-7.5 ,), consisted of an external region or mantle that appeared to be somewhat greyish because it consisted of (apparently) many small oil- spherules, all of which were individually hyaline (P1. 17:5, 9). Similar greyish physical coloration normally occurs in all oil-bodies which are filled with small oil-spherules. This appears to account for the description by Buch of a "dicken, durchsichtigen, schwach braunischen Mantel." The center was filled with a very pale bluish appearing, homogene- ous, large oil-globule, in which no trace of oil-spherules could be seen. It will be seen that the drawings here given (P1. 17:5, 8) correspond quite closely to those given by Buch (1933, p. 129). I find, with Miiller, that the large inner, bluish oil-globule may occur singly, or occasionally 2 or 3 such, smaller globules occur. Miiller (1939, p. 335) reduces silvicola to synonymy, stating: "Im Schatten und sehr feucht wachsende Formen der L. ventricosa zeigen bei etwa 500 facher Vergr6sserung eine stark licht-brechende Olkugel im Innern der Olk6rper. Bei 1000 facher Vergr6sserung kann man aber am gleichen Blatt sowohl diesen Typ, wie auch einen anderen mit mehreren Olkiugelchen im Innern erkennen . . . wie er bei L. ventricosa normaltrweise auftritt." However, the material from Great Palisade was collected on an open, rather insolated, and rather dry peaty talus slope, among Dicranum and Bazzania and other meso-xerophytes. This indicates (as Buch claimed in 1942) that silvicola is not a modi- fication of shaded, moist sites, but apparently a genetic form. Its status can only be determined by more critical work over a greater range. Buch (1936, p. 60) separates silvicola from ventricosa also by the leaf width (75-95% the length in silvicola; 95-120% in ventricosa). This character appears to be subject to almost too much environmental modification to be of use in a key or in identification. The local material, from a rela- tively exposed and dry site represents a mod. colorata-mesoderma-densifolia; it has the leaves varying from 95-105% as wide as long, and therefore approaches ventricosa in this regard. Similarly, ventricosa, when growing under shaded conditions, as a mod. lepto- derma-viridis-laxifolia) may have the leaves no wider than long (varying from 90-105%), and therefore is not separable from silvicola on this basis. Buch has stressed that silvicola is a paler green than ventricosa, and this appears to be true for the Minnesota material. A number of other collections of dead plants have been referred to silvicola, on the basis of narrow, rectangular leaves occurring correlated with an exposed habitat. Many other collections have been seen, of dry plants, with the leaves intermediate in width between silvicola and ventricosa; these have been considered to be ventricosa. It is possi- ble, therefore, that some of the stations listed as ventricosa may actually belong to the deceptively similar silvicola.* The narrow leaves also ally silvicola with L. porphyroleuca. Sterile plants, therefore, cannot be separated from porphyrcleuca, except on oil-body characteristics. I find that in typical porphyroleuca there are fewer (usually 7-9) oil-bodies per cell, all or most of which lack a central, large oil-globule. L. silvicola also usually is abundantly supplied with yellow-green getnmae; L. porphyroleuca, except under unusually mesic conditions, virtually or quite lacks them. * After this was written (Sept. 195 1) numerous collections were made on the Susie Islands, Minn. Most of the L. ventricosa-like plants seen (from Porcupine I., Belle Rose I., and Big Susie I., as well as from Long I.) proved to be L. silvicola, on the basis of oil-body characteristics. Probably, this latter species or form will prove to be at least as common as L. ventricosa, s. str.</page><page sequence="105">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 361 Distribution.-COOK: Grand Marais, S 13265; Near tip of Pigeon Point, S 17449?, S 17266, S 17350; Long I., Susie Is., S 7169b (approaching L. porphyroleuca), S 7163a, S 7167a, S 7160a, S 7173a, S 7174a; Big Susie I., S 11731 (trace), S 9967 (?); Lucille I., S 13378b (trace); Porcupine I., S 18534b, S 19402.

P1. 18 This species is a common, rather ubiquitous form in the Spruce-Fir Climax region and extends for some distance to the north (into the Tundra), as well as slightly into the Deciduous Forest regions. It occurs usually associated with moist, shaded rocks, in the crevices and on the vertical sides of which it may form extensive mats; frequently it is associated on the north or northwest facing ledges (as at Grand Marais and the Susie Islands) with species such as Sc. nemorosac, Lophozia kunz.eana, Blepharostoma, Lepidozia reptans, etc. The species has a preference for a pH below 6.0, but appears to be unable to compete when the growth of the moss-mat and subsequent decay result in a pH of below 3.8. Between pH 4 and pH 6 the species, however, is very abundant on thin soil over rocks and as a chasmophyte. Under conditions of greater acidity (as on the sunny, wet, Sphagnum-hummocks capping the crests of ledges) it is replaced by a red-pigmented modification with large trigones.* It occurs occasionally on decaying wood, though it is here often replaced by L. porphyroleuca. One of the least critical factors governing the occurrence of the species appears to be the amount of humic acids in the substrate: obvi- ously, therefore, the species is often an initial or subinitial invading species, wherever mesic conditions prevail; under such conditions it can persist until a dense peat layer is produced. This is our only Dilophozia occurring over peat in bogs, far from any rock- outcrops (as near Ray and near Ericsburg, Minn.). The majority of collections of this species can be easily identified, since the species has a characteristic appearance: the leaves are scarcely or not longer than wide and bi- lobed about 1/4 - 1/3, with the lobes of the upper almost always with conspicuouls gemmae masses that are bright yellow-green; the leaves are furthermore quite oblique and spread conspicuously, with the lobes never distinctly incurved and with the leaves not at all concave, except near the base. Under shaded conditions the species is pure green in color: never exhibiting any carmine pigmentation or extensive brownish coloration. Mate- rial growing in exposed sites (as over sunny, wet peat, or on thin soil over sunny moist rocks) often is more or less reddish pigmented, and approaches the following variety. Under the microscope, the generally smaller trigones serve to separate it from porphyro- leuca, when sterile.4 When fertile, the short teeth of the perianth-mouth (almost all 1-2 cells long, see P1. 18:7) separate it from the related porphyroleuca. For separation from silvicola see the latter. Lophozia ventricosa var. longiflora (Nees) comb. n. Jungermannia longiflora Nees, Eur. Leberm. II:95, 1836. This represents, apparently, the extreme development of robust ventricosa. Conklin (1942) reports longiflora from several stations in Cook County, and (1929) from Wis- consin. The material, in my estimate, is probably a modification of ventricosa, from which it differs in robustness (plants often 3-5 cm long; perianths 1 x 3 mm large, or usually * Such pigmented modifications often have somewhat concave leaves, and approach confertifolia Schiffn.

The plants, when typically developed, are extremely beautiful, because of the vivid pigmentation. The variant appears to occur largely over peat on rockwalls or ledges, under sunny but moist conditions. Probably all or most material usually placed in longi- flora will prove merely to be an ecological variant (modification) of ventricosa.

LOPHOZIA (DILOPHOZIA) PORPHYROLEUCA (Nees) Schiffn. P1. 19:9-15 This species occurs scattered throughout the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, and extends very slightly into the northern edge of the Deciduous Zone and southern edge of the Arctic-alpine Zone. In Minnesota it is limited strictly to the Subarctic-subalpine Region. The ecological distribution of this species needs further study: all material that can be clearly determined as this species has been found on acid, organic substrata. The species is a mesophyte or meso-xerophyte, occurring usually on decaying, moist to very moist, often quite sunny and exposed logs, or peat associated with Jamesoniella autumnalis, various Riccardia species (latifrons, palmata), occasionally Odontoschisma denudatum, and various Cephalozia species (media, connivens, catenulata), as well as Calypogeia suecica. On peaty banks (and logs in bogs that are quite decayed and peaty) it may occur with Lophozia incisa, Mylia anomala, Calypogeia sphagnicola, etc.* The pH range is from about 4.8 to 3.5. The related L. ventricosa usually invades rocky banks at a mucb earlier stage, when there is virtually no deposition of soil and humic materials; it, how- ever, may persist until Mylia and Sphagnum come in, and is then associated with Odon- toschisma denudatum, L. porphyroleuca, Calypogeia sphagnicola, Lepidozia reptans, etc. Under such conditions the two species are very difficult to keep apart, but the L. ventri- cosa appears to be a larger plant under such conditions, with wider leaves, at best reddish at base only and with the trigones only moderately large and slightly bulging: while the porphyroleuca-like plants are entirely reddish-pigmented (iincluidiing the stem), have nar- rower leaves, with very large bulging trigones, and usually totally lack gemmae. Buch (1934) has shown by experimental studies that two distinct entities are at hand that may produce ecocopies: therefore the two species are to be separated, on the basis of sterile plants, with extreme care. Fertile plants of this species can be easily recognized, since they have the perianths * Here it intergrades with the longiflora-extreme of ventricosa and with L. silvi- cola.</page><page sequence="108">364 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 3. 4. 5. 2. 10~~~~~6 9.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~7 '4~~~~~~I PLATE 19.

In the related ventricosa and silvicola the teeth are 1-2 cells long, with at best very occasional teeth 3 cells long and none 4 cells long (P1. 18:7). Most plants, even when sterile, can be separated from other species in Dilophozia by the very large trigones, often one fourth the size of the lumen of the surrounding cells (P1. 19:9, 11). Material from shaded, moist areas, such as moist logs in shaded woods (where the species, fortunately, rarely occurs) have smaller trigones and are nearly impossible to keep separate from ventricosa and silvicola from exposed, insolated localities. Collections of these two species,, therefore, should be accom- panied by exact data on available moisture and amount of insolation, as well as type of substrate. L. porphyroleuca agrees with the closely related silvicola in having relatively narrow leaves (0.75-0.95 as wide as long [P1. 19:12, 131), but shaded plants of ventri- cosa may have them no broader (such shade-forms of ventricosa usually have very small trigones, however). L. porphyroleuca differs from silvicola in that the oil-bodies normally lack the central, highly refractive oil-globule (as well as in the more distinctly, longly dentate perianth-mouth); furthermore they occur mostly 6-9 per cell (P1. 17:9).

Evs. P1. 21:1-8 This species has a restricted distribution and occurs largely in the upper part of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, northward into the Arctic region. It is almost totally unknown for the Deciduous Region.* In Minnesota it appears to be nearly limited to the Lake Superior shore, occurring to a limited degree in the Lake District facing Canada. The species in our region, at least, is usually more xerophytic than our other species of Dilo- phozia, occurring most commonly on rather dry, but shaded and sheltered, north and northwest facing cliff-walls and ledges, where it is either a pioneer or comes in soon after the ecesis of the first pioneer species; more rarely it occurs on sheltered, moist rocks. It is associated here with Diplophyllum taxifolium, Anastrophyllum minutum, and occa- sionally A. michauxii, more rarely with Lepidozia reptans, L. (Barbilophozia) barbata and Tritomaria quinquedentata. The pH range is about 4.5-5.4. In our area, at least, swamp forms of this species apparently are quite absent, and the species is restricted largely to more xeric situations, occurring almost constantly as an epipetric or chasmo- phytic form. When gemmae are present (and this is fortunately almost always the case) this species is quite easily recognized, since it is our only one (except the very different L. longidens and latifolia) with reddish-brown gemmae. Gemmae-free plants are to be recog- nized by the pronounced tendency for the development of brownish secondary pigmenta- tion: shade plants being usually olive-green to olive-brown, while more exposed plants are a deeper brown, somewhat reddish-brown. The plants usually form thin mats. This species differs also in leaf-form from our other forms: the leaves are orbicular, with a very broad and shallow, crescentic sinus, descending only about 1/10 - 1/6 the leaf-length, while the lobes are very short and broad (P1. 18:1-4). The cells are rather smaller than * The writer (Schuster, 1949) has reported a single station from the Deciduous Forest Region, in the eastern United States.

P1. 20 Apparently extremely rare and of restricted occurrence in our region. In Minnesota confined, as far as known, to the Susie Islands. The species is high Subalpine and Arctic- alpine, and occurs in the center of its range under diverse ecological conditions: on wet rocks, over peat in bogs, etc. The species occurs here at the southernmost periphery of its range and the few, somewhat doubtful, local collections are from over Sphagnum on a relatively dry, exposed peaty crest, capping southwest facing ledges on Lucille (High) Island and from a cliff-wall (Porcupine Island). Here the species occurred associated with Mylia anomala, Cephalozia media, Cephaloziella subdentata, Calypogeia sphagni- cola, etc.: i.e., other members of the Mylia Associule. Elsewhere in the United States reported only from New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine, at high altitudes (as L. confertifolia). The most characteristic features of this species are the concave, shallowly bilobed orbicular leaves: with the sinuses descending merely to ?4, usually crescentic or obtusely angular. The leaf-width is generally from 1.0-1.2 the leaf-length, and the lobes are extremely broad and obtuse. Almost all material (including the local plants) has the leaves with incurved lobes, thus forming circular, saucer-like or cup-like structures; the leaves, furthermore, are more or less dorsally erect in material from sunny, exposed sites (and may then be rather closely imbricate and dense). The local plants are from such a site, and have rather erect, strongly concave leaves. Plants from insolated sites, further- more, are generally more or less brownish or reddish-brown (rarely distinctly carmine, unlike the var. longiflora of L. ventricosa), with the ventral side of the stem (and the rhizoid-bases), as well as the cell-walls of the leaves, more or less strongly purple or brown-pigmented. In contrast, the gemmae always appear to remain bright greenish, and form strikingly contrasted masses at the apices of the plants. Because of the broad leaves, this species can be confused only with L. alpestris and latifolia, and L. ventricosa. It agrees with L. alpestris in the shallowly bilobed, orbicular leaves, and in the tendency for the cells of the leaves to have brownish walls; it differs at once from alpestris in that the leaf-cells are larger (22-25 A in the leaf-tips, as in L. * In my experience the plants are usually present in a mod. parvifolia-gemmifera, with the leaves unusually narrow, the margins dentate through gemmae formation; this is prob- ably the xeric extreme, or "var." gellidd. Only on Sand I., Wisconsin have I seen the more robust plant, with strongly concave, broad leaves; these plants (occurring over moist sandstone ledges 4-6 feet above Lake Superior, with Cephalozia bicuspidata, Scapania nemorosa) also abundantly produced male plants and perianths-but relatively few, and inconspicuous, gemmae masses. The male plants have elongate, spiciform androecia (5-7 pairs or more bracts, which are closely approximate to imbricate), of a more compact appearance than in related species.</page><page sequence="112">368 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 2.~~~~~~~~~3 X 3 5Sf 2 X So/\ 0 13. 5 PLATE 2 1.

The gemmae-color and more shallowly bilobed, more concave leaves, as well as the somewhat smaller size of the leaf-cells separates the species from L. latifolia. Gemmae-bearing forms, therefore, need never be confused with either of the above species. Confusion with L. ventricosa (especially the variety longiflora) is, however, very easily possible, since the two species share similar-sized leaf-cells, green gemmae, and often approach each other in appearance. In L. ventricosa, however, the leaf-lobes are not incurved, but more or less spreading, the leaves are not cupped or strongly concave, most leaves are divided 1/4 - 1/3 (only occasional ones have a lunate sinus), and the cell- walls are colorless, or become carmine (very rarely brownish); the ventral side of the stem also becomes reddish on exposed forms, but never or only rarely brownish beneath. All of these differences are subtle, and the pigmented forms of ventricosa (= longiflora) may very closely approach the dense-leaved, pigmented forms of wenzelii (= confertifolia Schiffn.) .* Distribution.-COOK: Lucille I., S 13657d; Porcupine I., S 19409, S 18538a.j LOPHOZIA (DILOPHOZIA) LATIFOLIA Schuster The Bryologist, 1953 (in press) P1. 21:9-15 This rare species has been found at a single site (The Point, Grand Marais), under conditions approximating those found in the Arctic, in moist, but more or less insolated rock-crevices, kept moist by seepage, within a few feet of the edge of Lake Superior. The plants are consociated with such oxylophytes as Polytrichum, Lophozia kunzeana and Drosera rotundifolia, and such vascular species as Potentilla tridentata and Ledurn groenlandicum. Capsules are freely produced in August and September. * At one of the two Minnesota stations the two appear to grow together, indicating there is a specific difference. The ventricosa plants bear gemmae relatively sparsely, and agree with the longiflora-form in the carmine colored bases of the leaves, and in the more or less canaliculate-concave leaves (which are not dorsally secund, however, to any great degree). The plants I refer to wenzelii bear much denser gemmae-masses, never have the leaf-bases pigmented, but have the leaf-lobes brownish and the underside of the stem brown; the leaves are almost all cupped and dorsally secund. The two are so close, how- ever, that only intensive study resulted in any differentiation between them. j Material of this collection was sent to two European authorities, Dr. H. Buch and Dr. K. Miiller. Dr. Muller expressed the opinion that this represents L. wenzelii. Dr. Buch (May 28, 1952), however, wrote: "Ihre Lophozia wenzelii scheint mir eine grosszellige Form von L. alpestris zu sein. Darauf deuted die stark schrige Blattinsertion (die richtige L. wenzelii hat eine nur wenig schrage Blattinsertion). Solche eine Form von L. alpestris hat S. Arnell aus Sweden unter den Namen L. alpestris var. mdjor C. Jensen ver6ffenlicht. Es ware interessant wenn es sich bestatigen wiurde, dass diese var. nicht nur durch grossere Zellen sondern auch durch L. silvicola-ahnliche Olkorper von den gewohnlichen L. alpestris abweicht. Sie konnte dann vielleicht als Art behandelt Werden. Dann muss sie aber allem Anschein nach L. gronlandica (Nees) benannt werden." To the writer, it appears impossible that this collection has anything in common with L. alpes- tris, from which it differs in (1) absence of any ability to form reddish-brown pigmenta- tion; (2) larger number of oil-bodies per cell (3) the L. silvicola-like nature of these oil-bodies; (4) yellow-green gemmae, without any trace of reddish pigmentation. Buch (1933) showed by culture experiments that the gemmae color of L. alpestris remained constant, even under culture in diffuse light. Under these conditions, the writer believes that (1) either a discrete species is at hand, or (2) L. wenzelii is at hand. Until study of living L. wenzelii will show that it has different oil-bodies than those figured here, treatment of the present collection under this name appears wisest. The writer has com- pared the plants carefully with plants collected by Schiffner at the original site of L. wenzelii (e.g., topotypic). He can find no differences in leaf-insertion between this mate- rial of L. wenzelii and the Minnesota material here referred to that species. The leaf-formn and size of the two plants appear identical.</page><page sequence="114">370 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) L. latifolia, in spite of four years of study, remains a somewhat problematical taxon. In the uniformly dioecious inflorescences, the wide leaves (P1. 21:11-13), the crenulate to short-denticulate perianth mouth (P1. 21:9), and the pigmented gemmae (P1. 21:15) the plants resemble L. alpestris. These similarities probably do not connote close rela- tionship. The relatively large leaf-cells (24-32 u in the leaf-tips) and the inability of the cells to develop more than vestigial trigones (P1. 21:10), the purplish color of the geminae, their large size and relatively rare occurrence, the wide leaves (P1. 21:11-13), as well as in the crenulate perianth-mouth and the stem-anatomy are much as in L. eacisa. However, the uniformly dioecious inflorescences, the much more deeply divided, unusually broad leaves, the form of the perichaetial bracts (P1. 21:14), and the non- dentate male bracts indicate a different species is at hand. However, the localized L. juren- sis Meylan (known only from Switzerland; fide Muller, ad litt., a variety of L. excisa) may have partially dioecious inflorescences. The writer is of the opinion that L. excisa, as is often the case with "old" and isolated species, may consist of several biologically discrete species, of which the present taxon may represent an example. Much more study of this problem is needed. For more detailed illustrations of this species, a description and discussion of its morphology, the student is referred to the recent paper by Schuster (1953).

In this I follow the previous treatment (Schuster, 1949) on the Hepaticae of Central and Western New York, and Schuster, 1951. The genus here includes those species with constantly bilobed leaves (Pls. 22:1, 5; 23:2; 24:7), in whiclh the dorsal half of the leaf-insertion is nearly (Pls. 22:5; 24:18) or quite (P1. 23:2) transverse, and in which the leaves are concave, more or less channeled or canaliculate; all of the included species also have a distinct tendency to grow erect or ascending, and have relatively few rhizoids (Pls. 22:6; 24:19) (never forming a dense ventral mat); the tne underside of the stem is also totally devoid of all trace of underleaves (Pls. 22:4; 23:3; 24:17). The stem structure is quite uniform: the medul'la is not at all distinctly dorsiventrally differentiated, and there is no, ventral strand of smaller cells (Pls. 22:9; 23:10; 24:2). The perianth in all of the species is plicate and not beaked at the apex (Pls. 22: 7; 23: 1 ). The members of this group have in common a distinct appearance: the ascending growth, nearly or quite transverse and channeled or concave uniform- ly bilobedl leaves and lack of underleaves are usually enough to identify it in the field. Our four species fall into four subgenera (Euanastrophyllum, Eurylobus, Sphenolobus, and Crossocalyx); the subgenera are separable by the key on page 311, while che species may be recognized by the artificial key (Couplets 16-18), supplemenited by the following key: KEY TO SPEcIEs 1 Small or minute species, 0.4-1.5 mm wide; leaves slightly to distinctly longer than wide (Pls. 23:4, 11; 24:5), with dorsal end inserted quite transversely (Pls. 23:2; 24:7), and with dorsal base not extending beyond midline of stem; cell- walls nearly equally thickened (Pls. 23:8; 24:1) ---------------------------------------------------- 2 2.

(E.) michauvii ANASTROPHYLLUM (EURYLOBUS) SAXICOLUS (Schrad.) Schuster P1. 22 This species is decidedly northern in distribution: it occurs throughout the upper zone ("Hudsonian") of the Coniferous Panclimax, and into the Arctic-alpine Zone. It is virtually absent in the lower part of the Subarctic-subalpine ("Canadian Zone"), and appears to be quite rare everywhere. It has previously been reported from the United States only by Schuster (1951). Locally the species occurs on thin soil over diorite cliffs: it forms extremely large and luxurious mats on the shaded, northwest facing sides of verti- cal cliffs, associated with Tritomaria quinquedentata and A. (Sphenolobus) minututn, Lophozia ventricosa, Diplophyllum taxifolium, etc.; it also occurs at the exposed crests of the cliffs, forming a more densely leafy and olive-brownish pigmented modification, associ- ated with Polytrichum and Cladoniae, as well as the xerophilous hepatic, Ptilidium ciliare. The species, under all conditions, occurred under relatively acid conditions: the measured pH range being 4.6 to 5.2. The single record of this rarity from the United States, together with the fact that it locally covers the greater part of several hundred square feet, with a coverage of 30-90%, makes one wonder why the species, though so abundant locally, is of such extremely restricted occurrence. The local material was entirely female: a few immature perianths being found, with no male plants present. The absence of any sexual means of reproduc- tion thus clearly indicates that all of the local material represents a single clone. The very restricted distribution thus appears to be bound up with the inability of the species tc reproduce effectively: a combination of dioecism with lack of specialized asexual means of reproduction. The species is quite easy to determine: the large size (1.8-3 mm wide and 3-6 cm long), the suberect growth, and the constantly bilobed leaves, whose form and insertion are quite different from those existing in other species, at once separate it (P1. 22:1, 5, 7). The dorsal half of the leaf is nearly transversely inserted (but slightly decurrent), while the ventral half is oblique; the leaves are more or less complicate-concave, and the apex of the ventral lobe is incurved: this results in a cup-shaped, hollow leaf of very characteristic form (P1. 22:5). The leaves (P1. 22:3, 8), when spread out, are much broader than long (difference from the much smaller A. minutum, as well as from A. michauxii.) The species, superficially, looks more like a Scapania: the dorsal lobe being smaller than the ventral. It might also be confused with Lophozia kunzeana, from which it differs at once in the absence of underleaves.

Schuster P1. 23 Throughout much of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, and well into the Tundra Pan- climax. This small species occurs as a frequent member of the Lophozia-Scapania Associ- ule of shaded, protected vertical cliffs. It normally occurs as a distinct xerophyte: on dry, often wind-swept, at times sheltered, but usually strongly shaded cliffs and ledges. It is associated here most often, in our region, with Anastrophyllum michauxii, Lophozia alpestris (occasionally ventricosa), Diplophyllum taxifolium, and occasionally Anastrophyl- lum saxicolus, Lepidozia reptans, and Tritomaria quinquedentata (when occurring near its mesic extreme). Much more rarely the species occurs on decaying wood, though in Minne- sota it is apparently exclusively an epipetric and chasmophytic species. The species appears to lack tolerance for any direct sunlight: it may form large mats on shaded, northwest facing cliffs, or in narrow cuts, where there is little or no seepage, and where atmospheric moisture is high. The two other factors that restrict the occurrence of the species are lack of tolerance for much moisture, and lack of tolerance for a calcareous substrate. The species is a pioneer on rather dry rock faces. It invades rock faces that are a little less exposed to desiccation than those preferred by the Frullanid asagrayana-Lichen Associule, but is often found near the base of cliffs where the latter associule occurs: here it forms a matrix in which Diplophyllum and less xeromorphic Lophoziae get a start. The species is quite easy to recognize: it forms brownish-black mats of filiform, slender, fine arcuate, often intertwined, simple or sub-simple plants, which are either suberect or strongly ascending. The individual plants have a very characteristic appearance: they have the leaves inserted extraordinarily regularly: giving the plants a decidedly pectinate appearance (P1. 23 :7). This, combined with the rigid, flexuous form of the stems, is quite diagnostic. The leaves are quite unlike those of any related form except robust plants of the much smaller A. hellerianum. They are canaliculate-concave, distinctly chan- neled, with the dorsal lobe bent up and lying loosely over the ventral; the dorsal half of the leaf is quite transversely inserted (P1. 23:1, 2, 7). The cells of this species are also diagnostic: they are rather small (13-16 A wide), with the walls always rather evenly thickened, lacking trigones in the lobes, and often yellowish (P1. 23:8). Gemmae bearing plants (which occur nearly universally in the patches occurring under relatively xeric conditions) are very diagnostic: the erect or ascending shoots become attenuate, with the leaves somewhat reduced in size and erect or erect-appressed (Pl. 23:6). In this regard it approaches, in some measure, the related A. hellerianum: which is a relatively minute plant, however.

The species apparently requires a substrate rather rich in humic acids, but is unable to persist after the log has fallen into humus. It occurs under a measured pH of 4.6-5.2. Though the species is very minute and often overlooked, it manages to compete with the larger species (such as Jamesoniella) largely because of its peculiar growth: the basal portions of the plant are decumbent, but soon give rise to erect, slender, filiform, terete shoots, bearing minute appressed leaves, and a cluster of purplish-red gemmae at the apex*. The constant presence of these erect shoots with their little masses of purplish gemmae at the apex at once identifies the species, even in the field and by the naked eye. Only three species occur on decaying logs that grow similarly erect and have reddish gemmae: Scapania apiculata, S. glaucacephala, and Lophozia longidens. All three of these have much more robust gemmiparous shoots, with less obviously reduced leaves (except for the Sc. apiculata). Confusion with the latter, is, therefore, quite possible in the field, especially since both species are so minute, and since the gemmae in both are 1-celled. In the Scapania, however, there are always associated some plants with the typical unequally bilobed leaves of Scapania, and the erect gemmiparous shoots are more robust. Under the microscope the bulging trigones of the leaves of the Scapania and the ovoid gemmae (rather than quadrangular, as in hellerianum) at once will separate it from Anastrophyllum hellerianum, in which the cell-walls are nearly equally thickened (P1. 24:1) and the gemmae are quadrangular, and purplish (rather than reddish-brown) (P1. 24:4).

Buch P1. 24:10-20 The present species is the only one of its subgenus in our region. It is of restricted distribution in Minnesota: occurring only in the vicinity of the Lake Superior Shore, where it may be rather common. The species in general occurs throughout the Subarctic- subalpine Zone, with an extremely restricted distribution to the north and south of that zone. Though the species occurs occasionally on rotting logs (in the far north and high in the mountains) it is more common locally on the vertical faces of exposed to sheltered, rather dry rocks and ledges, where it may form extensive, rather thick red-brown to greenish-brown mats. It is here a pioneer species and associated most commonly with A. (Sphenolobus) minutum, Lophozia alpestris, Diplophylltum taxifolium, and occasionally with A. (Sphenolobus )saxicolus. The species, locally at least, is somewhat of a xero- phytei and is a pioneer species, together with A. (sph.) minutum, on relatively sheltered cliff-faces that are not quite as exposed and xeric as those invaded by the Frullania asagrayana-Lichen Associule. Under the most mesic extreme frequented by the species, the following forms are associated: Scapania nemorsa, Tritomaria quinquedentata (occasion- ally exsecta or exsectiformis), L. (Orthocaulis) attenuata, Lophozia ventricosa, etc. The species is here obviously a member of the mesic Lophozia-Scapania Epipetric Associule. * These are normally more attenuate and filiform than in P1. 24:3, and are usually even more slender than figured for A. minutum, P1. 23:6. They generally occur in great abundance and may often be greatly crowded.</page><page sequence="120">376 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) The species lacks any toleration for lime, hence is unable to invade bare calcareous rocks (much like A. (Sph.) minutum, with which it nearly invariably occurs). It does not have a high tolerance for direct sunlight (though this is somewhat higher than in A. (Sph.) minutum) . Rather rarely it occurs on shaded decaying logs (as at Cascade and Encampment Rivers), here associated with such species as Odontoschisma denudatum, A. (Crosso- calyx) hellerianum, Cephalozia catenulata and lacinulata, and Jamesoniella. The rather large size (about equal to that of L. (Orthocaulis) kunzeana and Anas- trophyllum saxicolus) at once eliminates confusion with the more filiform and slender A. (Sph.) minutum. Small forms may be confused with the latter, but the large, bulging yellow trigones of the leaves (P1. 24:10), and the dull purplish-brown gemmae, as well as the leaf-form (broad-ovate, with the greatest width near base, (P1. 24:13) will distin- guish it from minutum. From the latter, as well as all other 2-lobed-leaved forms with which it might be confused (such as A. saxicolus, L. (Orthocaulis) kunzeana) it differs in the acute leaf-lobes, of which the dorsal stands away from the stem, hence is more or less squarrose (P1. 24:20), while its base extends across the stem, and is distinctly decur- rent on the stem (P1. 24:18, 20). In none of the other species that could be mistaken for it is the dorsal lobe squarrose and decurrent at base. The leaves, when dry, are quite secund. The somewhat similar appearing L. (O.) kunzeana differs at once in the presence of underleaves. When fertile, the large clavate perianths of this species, from whose base the bracts spread widely, are quite diagnostic. In related or similar forms the perianth is less longly exserted, and the bracts more or less sheath its base.

TRITOMARIA Schiffn. The four species of this genus agree in having 3-lobed leaves with the dorsal base, at least, more or less transversely attached (P1. 25:7, 8). On poorly developed or gemmae-bearing shoots many of the leaves may have the basal two lobes united, and the leaves appear very unequally 2-lobed (Pls. 25:12; 26:7). The most important characters by which the species can be recognized in the field is the extremely asymmetrical form of the leaves: the ventral leaf-margins are usually much longer than the dorsal margin, and the dorsal lobe thus appears to be a mere "tooth" (P1. 26:5-7): this does not quite hold for T. scitula, however (P1. 25:7). The species all lack under- leaves, and the leaves have cells with large to bulging trigones (Pls. 25:11; 27:3-4). Except in Tr. quinquedentata (which usually lacks gemmae), the species all have conspicuous reddish-brown gemmae masses at the apices of the upper leaf-tips (P1. 25:7; 26:6). The presence of the latter, together with the asymmetrical trilobed leaves, is usually enough to identify the genus in the field. As in the closely related Dilophozia, the rhizoids form a dense ventral mat (P1. 27:1). The four species of the genus found in North America all occur in Minne- sota. They are keyed out in the artificial key to species of Lophoziaceae (p. 314).

Joerg. P1. 25 This relatively rare species occurs near its southeastern limits in Minnesota. It is decidedly more northern in distribution, occurring in the upper zone of the Spruce-Fir Biome (the "Hudsonian" Zone), but more commonly in the Arctic-alpine region. It is relatively frequent in the northeastern corner of the state, where the climate approaches the closest to the Arctic-alpine, but occurs nowhere else. Unlike exsecta and exsectiformis (with which, in my experience, it never occurs), the present species is a "calciphile": it occurs on moist, usually sheltered ledges and cliff-crests, or in crevices of such cliffs on very thin soil, over such basic rocks as diorite, under pH conditions ranging from about 5.8 to 7.0. The associated species are also "calciphiles": Scapanid gymnostomophila, Sc. cuspiduligera, Sc. mucronata praetervisa, Odontoschisma macounii, Plagiochila asplenioides, Lophozia (Leiocolea) gillmani and heterocolpa, etc. Very occasionally it occurs under less mesic conditions, and is then found with Scapania subalpind, etc. Unlike Sc. degenii, the species is unable to succeed under very exposed, sunny conditions: but prefers northwest facing cliffs of islands or peninsulas, or the north facing sides of ravines (such as that of the Temperance and Gooseberry Rivers). This species can scarcely be confused with any other. The nearly uniformly trilobed leaves (even on gemmiparous shoots), with gemmae nearly always present in reddish- brown masses at the leaf-apices (P1. 25 :7), remind one of exsecta and exsectiformis. However, the almost symmetrical trilobed leaves (P1. 25:7, 8, 10) are quite unlike those found in the latter two species or in quinquedentata. The species looks superficially more like a species of Lophozia, for instance L. longidens. None of the species of Dilophozia, however, have uniformly trilobed leaves, and there is no species of the subgenus Ortho- CdUliS that remotely resembles scituld. (Trilobed leaves in SCitUld always have the anterior margin shorter than the posterior; the reverse holds in Orthocaulis.)

P1. 26 The present species occurs in all of the Coniferous Biome, and in insolated places in the northern edge of the Deciduous Biome.

On decaying logs it is asso- ciated most often with Jamesoniella autumnalis, Nowellia, Lophozia ascendens, L. longi- dens, and Scapania apiculata, occasionally with Lophozia porphyroleuca, etc. The species is not a pioneer on logs, but may persist until they have virtually disintegrated to humus; the pH varies from about 3.9-5.2 under such conditions. Though very often associated with cliffs and ledges, the species usually occurs over at least a thin layer of organic matter. It is relatively rare on calcareous rocks,* unless there is a humus layer; when there is a distinct humus or peat layer, and when pH conditions are rather low, the species may be very common, associated with Lophozia incisa, Lophozia ventricosa, Blepharostoma, Lepidozia, etc. The species under such conditions tends to form pure mats: the erect caespitose plants growing closely together. In brief, the species is essentially a humicole, with a rather high tolerance for sunlight, and a moderate tolerance for intermittent moisture conditions. The species is extraordinarily similar to, and often found with the closely related T. exsecta. I have been totally unable to find any indication of a difference in ecological preferenda in the two species. Since they are totally impossible to tell apart without use of the monocular microscope, it is impossible to tell which one is at hand in the field. The present species has the transversely inserted, elongate appearing, concave-canaliculate, asymmetrical leaves characteristic of exsecta; it has similar, reddish-brown masses of gemmae at the apices of the shoots, and is quite similar in size. Under the microscope the much larger leaf-cells (mostly over 22-24 ,u long, on an average in the leaf-middle) and the angular or pyramidal form of the large (17-25 ,u long) gemmae (P1. 26:3), will distin- guish exsectiformis from exsecta. The former almost always has large bulging trigones; the latter usually has the cell-walls becoming evenly thick-walled, in plants from insolated sites. Distribution.-CARLTON: Carlton, C 601A.

The present species has a distribution conforming almost exactly with that of the related exsectiformis: the Spruce-Fir Forest Region, and the southern part of the Tundra region, with isolated stations from the Deciduous Region. It appears to have, as well, virtually identical ecological requirements insofar as edaphic conditions are concerned. In the field, it is therefore quite impossible to decide which of these superficially identical species is at hand. In my experience, exsecta is much scarcer in our region.f * In southeastern Minnesota (as at Taylors Falls) it occurs over calcareous sandstone, however, together with Scapania saxicola and mucronata, and Lepidozia. j Although 8 or 9 collections of the complex, out of 10, made in the present area will prove to be T. exsectiformis, the reverse holds when collections are made in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. In the latter area, T. exsecta becomes very common,</page><page sequence="125">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 381 3.~~~~~~5 4. 2.~~~6 7.~~~~~~~~~~~I PLATE 26. Tritomaria exsectiformis.-1.

It often grows, as a corticole, as high as 3-6 feet up the trunks of living trees (chiefly Abies fraseri). This clearly indicates that in this species the physical (and per- haps, within bounds, the chemical) features of the substrate are not nearly as important in limiting its ecological distribution, as is saturation deficit and light intensity-two factors which are continuously very low in the fog-forests of the Southern Appalachians</page><page sequence="126">382 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Under the microscope the much smaller leaf-cells of the present species (only 12-18 ,u long, on an average, in the leaf-middle), and the ovoid shape of the smaller gemmae, which are only 12-18 ,u long, will separate it from exsectiformis. The difference in gem- ma size occasionally approaches the vanishing point. I have collected material of T. exsecta, at the Manitou R., with the mature gemmae averaging 18 ,u long. In much material of exsectiformis, the gemmae average scarcely larger. Therefore the critical sep- arating feature should be the smooth, ovoid shape of the gemmae of exsecta, rather than their size.

Subgenus TRILOPHOZIA* Schuster TRITOMARIA (TRILOPHOZIA) QUINQUEDENTATA (Huds.) Buch P1. 27 Throughout nearly all of the Coniferous Panclimax the present species is one of the relatively common forms, wherever one finds outcrops of rocks. It becomes quite rare in the southern edge of the coniferous zone (south of Duluth), but extends northward well into the Tundra Biome. The species, in its main range, occurs under a great variety of conditions, as long as there is some integral connection between its substrate and rock exposure. The species is essentially epipetric, but is only occasionally a pioneer species on rocks: it usually occurs at the crests of cliffs, over thin soil; from these it spreads into the crevices: reacting like a typical chasmophyte. From the crevices and cliff-crests it has limited ability to spread over exposed vertical rock faces, forming eventually dense mats whose size is limited by ice-action and their own weight when wet. Associated on rock walls and on slopes and ledges are such other Lophoziae as Anastrophyllum minutzum and Diplophyllum taxifolium (under conditions near the xeric extreme of the Tritomaria), and Lophozia ventricosa, Lepidozia reptans, Anastrophyllum saxicolus, and michauxii, L. (Orthocaulis) kunzeana and attenuata, L. (Barbilophozia) barbata and hatcheri. With the latter species, and under equally mesic conditions occur such Scapania species as Sc. undulata, nemorosa, stubalpina, mucronata, etc. The requirements of the species are very close to those of L. (Barbilophozia) barbata, and the species very often occur together. The above occurrences are under more acid conditions usually, with a tested pH range of from 4.8 to 5.5. Around the edges of sunny rock pools under subcalcareous conditions the species also occasionally manages to undergo ecesis, occurring with such species as Scapania degenii, Odontoschisma macounii, and Ptilidium ciliare under pH 5.5 to 6.8. Similarly, on thin soil over ledges the species may occur under subcalcareous conditions, with Tritomaria scitula, Scapania mucronata, Blepharostoma, Lepidozia, etc. I have never seen the species on old logs, though it is reported from them, but it occasionally can be found on peaty stumps in areas near ledges or cliffs. The present species is very easy to recognize: it is relatively large (2-3.5 mm wide and 2.5-5 cm long when well developed), and often forms large mats. The leaves are as broad or broader than long and very unequally trilobed, with none ever 2-lobed. The nearly constant absence of gemmae will separate it from the other species of Tritomaria.t * Similis Eutritomariae, sed foliae latae; plantae crescentes ad latera, non scandentes; caulis antheridiatus biseriatus. t I have seen gemmae-bearing plants only three or four times: these have yellow- brown gemmae, occurring rather sparsely at the apices of the shoots; the gemmae are usually so few they tend to be overlooked. In contrast to our other species of the genus, T. quinquedentata very regularly produces androecia and perianths, as well as quite frequently, capsules. There is, therefore, an important difference in mode of reproduction between the present species and its congeners (in which capsules are excessively rarely produced).</page><page sequence="127">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 383 o-~~~~~3 PLATE 27.

It differs from all other local leafy Hepaticae (except Lophozia obtusa and Cladopodiella fluitans) in the more or less rounded or obtuse lobes of the leaves. The more or less equally thick-walled cells will generally distinguish the species from both of the latter. The two local forms of the species may be distinguished as follows: KEY TO VARIETIES 1. Branches few, arising from beneath perianths (P1. 28:3), or from axils of bilobed leaves (very occasionally from axils of unlobed leaves); postical branches absent or rare (P1. 28:5, 8) -G. inflata (typical) 1. Branches of old stems numerous, the plants freely branched, arising largely from postical endogenous branches (P1. 29:1 ) (which are usually small-leaved), or from lateral branches subtended by an unlobed leaf (P1. 29:2) ------ G. inflata var. heterostipa GYMNOCOLEA INFLATA (Huds.) Dumort. P1. 28 This distinctive species is widely distributed, from the northern edge of the Deciduous Forest Zone (where it is very rare) to the Arctic-alpine Zone. In our region it is con- fined to the northeastern tip of the state. The species is, in this area, a distinctly epipetric species, and is to be classed as a pioneer on wet or moist, sunny exposed acidic rocks. It nearly always occurs in a blackish or brownish-black modification, and forms either thin mats over moist rocks at the edges of sunny rock pools (as on the Susie Islands), or occurs at the crest of high cliffs (as at Gunflint Lake). Around the edges of rock pools it may occur only a small distance from the "calciphile" Scapania degenii-Odontoschisma mnacounii Associule, which appears to be limited to localized basic outcrops.

It is associated in such places almost inevitably with Cephalozia bicuspidata (or the closely related lammersiana), occasionally with a little Lophozia kunzeana (which occurs here at its lower extreme, as regards pH). Like the Mylia-Lophozia incisa community of the peaty crests of cliffs, the Gymnocolea-Cephalozia bicuspidatd Associule occurs under very acid conditions (pH 3.7 to 4.5, rarely to 4.8). At pH 4.5-4.8 the calciphile Scapania degenii - 0. macounii Associule and oxylophyte Gymnocolea-Cephalozia bicuspidata Associule overlap, and a little intermingling of species occurs.

Gymnocalea is one of the distinctive species in our region. It can usually be identified by the leaves alone: these are ovate or orbicular, always equally bilobed, with the lobes characteristically rounded or obtuse at the apex. Our only similar species with obtusely bilobed succubous leaves is Cladopodiella fluitans, which has the leaves much longer than wide, ovate-rectangular, and unequally bilobed, with the ventral lobe larger. Gymnocolea, furthermore, has the branches arising at least in part laterally, Cladopodiella, uniformly ventrally. Under the microscope the thick-walled cells of Gymnocoled are characteristic, while those of Cladopodiella are usually quite thin. If fertile material is at hand, the species can be separated at a glance: in Gymnocolea the perianths are terminal on main shoots and are inflated and balloon-like, and fall off at the slightest touch (i.e., they are highly caducous, and are able to regenerate new plants); in Cladopodiella the periantlhs occur on very short ventral shoots, are long and trigonous, non-caducous. The caducous perianths of Gymnocoled are a unique feature, found in no other local hepatic. Gymno- coled also virtually lacks underleaves; Cladopodiella has them distinct.

GYMNOCOLEA INFLATA var. HETEROSTIPA (Carr. et Spruce) K. Muller P1. 29:1-3 This variant, of dubious validity, has been reported a single time from North America (Aberdeen, Washington). The plant occurs locally on shaded, moist to wet rocks, to- gether with Scapania species ('unduldtd, nemorosa), and with Cephalozia bicuspidatd. The general appearance of this form suggests Cladopodiella fluitans more closely than "typical" Gymnocoled. In the local material the leaves are distant, nearly or quite flat, and ovate-rectangular, distinctly longer than wide, with the leaf-lobes narrow and merely obtuse to subacute; the plants are greenish throughout, without any indication of brownish pigmentation. The most constant differentiating characters of the plant are the tendency for the production of numerous endogenous, small-leaved ventral branches (P1. 29:1) (especially from the underside of older, more robust plants), and the origin of most of the lateral branches from below ovate, unlobed leaves (P1. 29:2) (in typical inflata generally from the axil of a bilobed, normal leaf).t Distribution.-Porcupine Island, Susie Islands, Cook Co., over shaded, cold wet rocks, in run-off cut through northwest facing cliffs, Schuster 13606. Family JUNGERMANNIACEAE This family includes only entire-leaved forms that always have the leaves oblique (succubous) in insertion (PI. 29:4), and that have either very small underleaves or (more often) none (Pls. 30:8; 31:4); the rhizoids are always scattered and never in distinct rhizoid-initial regions (Pls. 30:8; 31:4). The * I have studied the specimen cited by Conklin, from St. Louis River, St. Louis Co., July 1886 (Arthur, Bailey, Holway); it contains only Jdmesonielld autumndlis, Anastro- phyllum hellerianum, A. michauxii, Blepharostoma, and came from a decayed log: a site on which Gymnocoled never occurs. Therefore, the following stations are the first clearly to establish the species in the state. f The variety grades into the species in this regard: in the local collection most branches clearly occur beneath ovate, undivided leaves, but some are subtended (i.e., occur in the axil of) normal, bilobed le4ve&gt;,</page><page sequence="131">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 387 terete, more or less plicate perianth (Pls. 29:4, 6; 30:8; 31:1, 4) (occasionally smooth and non-plicate, P1. 30:5), occurring at the apex of a main shoot, and the large terminal (eventually intercalary) androecia (PI. 32:1),* distinctly ally the family with the Lophoziaceae. In the position of the inflorescences the family also agrees with the related Plagiochilaceae, but the latter family has the perianths laterally compressed. In the usually 2-stratose (rarely 4-stratose) capsule wall the family also agrees with some Lophoziaceae, and stands in contrast to the Plagiochilaceae, which have a multistratose capsule wall. The oil-bodies of this family are also usually of the Lophozia-type: nearly smooth externally, and not consisting of a group of individually protruding oil-globules (Pl. 30:9). Any hepatic with entire succubously inserted leaves, with small or moder- ate trigones, and lateral branches (and no stolons) is safely referred to this family. Plagiocb1ila asplenioides, of the Plagiochilaceae often has the leaves nearly or quite entire, and may then be sought here: it differs in the more decurrent leaves from any of our Jungermanniaceae, as well as in the reflexed dorsal leaf-margins (the upper leaf-margins appearing like convex folds, with the actual leaf-edge not visible from above). This familyt includes a limited number of genera, four of which occur in our region. This family and the Lophoziaceae (and sometimes other groups) are combined in the portmanteau family "Jungermanniaceae" in most works, perhaps justly so. The genus Jamesoniella of the Jungermanniaceae perhaps forms a link between the present family and the Lophoziaceae. Since the presence of a link between two groups is not necessarily too significant, it seems preferable to limit the family more narrowly and keep the genera with entire leaves separate from the Lophozioid group. The distinction between the two groups is at least as valid as between the Lophoziaceae and Scapania- ceae. Perhaps all of them should be treated as subfamilies of a large family Jungermanniaceae. The generic classification of the underleaf-free genera has remained chaotic, with each worker following a different classification. The most recent attempt (Evans, 1937), founded on whether a perigynium is present or absent, seems essentially artificial to the writer. Evans would distinguish between a genus Jungermannia (with no perigynium) and a genus Plectocolea (with perigyni- um present). Both genera include forms with circular leaves, deeply 4-5- plicate perianths with a short terminal beak, i.e., species which belong to the J. sphaerocarpa complex. For instance, J. crenulata is included in Plectocolea, because of the supposed presence of a perigynium. J. pusilla and sphaerocarpa, on the other hand, are placed in lungermannia, supposedly restricted to species with the perianth not subtended by a perigynium. * In dioecious species the androecia became intercalary, although first forming a ter- mninal spike as in P1. 32:1; in paroecious species the androecia occur right below the female bracts (Pls. 30:8; 31:4). t Called the Nardiaceae in Muller (1940), "Nardioideae" in Frye and Clark (1943). In most recent works, except the two above, it also includes the lobed-leaved species here placed in the Lophoziaceae.</page><page sequence="132">388 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) However, J. crenulata normally has virtually no perigynium and has the perianth nearly or quite free from the bracts, while J. pusilla has the bracts and perianth distinctly "united" for I4 the length of the bracts (see K. Mtuller, 1916, p. 746, and Fig. 201e). Muller has stressed that J. pusilla exhibits clis- tinct affinities with both "Jungermannia sphaerocarpa var. nana" (which may also, in mountainous sites, show partial formation of a perigynium) and with "Plectocolea" crenulata. In fact, J. crenulata, J. pusilla, J. sphaerocarpa (and caespiticia, etc.) have in common so many characters (especially the type of perianth with a distinct dorsal keel, and with a short beak formed of nearly isodiametric cells; with orbicular leaves; with ability to develop brownish to reddish secondary pigmentation of the cell walls), that their generic separation seems entirely unwarranted. There is no difference that one can consider sig- nificant in the trivial differences between them as regards degree of develop- ment of the rudimentary perigynium: all three of these species may show a "free" perianth ("Jungermannia") or slight perigynium ("Plectocolea"). For that reason, the writer returns to an older classification, similar to that in Muller (1906), Macvicar (1926).* Such a classification is not a unilateral affair based only on presence or absence of perigynium, hence does not have the artificial features of Evans' classification. The writer believes, with Stephani (1901) that the perianth- form offers the key to the problem of generic groups here. The "fusion" of bracts and periantht is, at least in part, explicable as an "adaptive" feature, hence of little phyletic significance, and apparently of independent origin in several of the species of this complex. It will be noted that in the genera given in the following key, there is a distinct, independent tendency for the formation of perigynia in three of the * Muller (1942) has recently proposed a revised classification, in a paper not avail- able to the author until the treatment of the present family had been completed. Miiller suggests a division of Solenostoma (Mitten, 1865), which has priority over the name Aplozia (Dumortier, 1874), into two subgenera, Luridae (Spruce, 1885) and Rostellatae. The former is equivalent to Luridaplozia Joergensen (used here), the latter to typical Solenostoma (Eusolenostoma). Muller is willing to maintain Plectocolea as a distinct genus. As Evans (1937) points out, Mitten (1865) proposed Plectocolea as a subgenus of Solenostoma. The writer is content to consider it such. As is evident from the total disagreement between Miiller (1942), and Evans (1937), following Schiffner (1910), as to the position of S. crenulatum, the division between Solenostoma and Plectocolea is far from a sharp and clear one. It should also be pointed out that the writer agrees with Miuller (1942) in not consid- ering Jungermannia lanceolata (typo of Jungermannia, by common consent, if not on the basis of good nomenclatorial reasons) as congeneric with J. sphaerocarpa (type of Mitten's genus Solenostoma). Evans considers the two congeneric, and therefore treats Solenostama as a synonym of Jungermannia. t Strictly speaking, there is no fusion of bracts and perianth; the perianth and bracts are situated at the apex of a ring-like or tubular extension of the stem; i.e., a perigynium is developed. In the older literature this perigynium is considered to have arisen by the fusion of the bases of the bracts and the perianth. Knapp, however, has shown that the perigynium really originates by the outward growth of the stem-tissue below the bracts and perianth; hence the perigynium is to be interpreted as a hollow extension of the tissue of the axis, or stem.</page><page sequence="133">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 389 six groups (Nardia, Plectocolea, Eusolenostorma); there is development of a beaked perianth in two (Eusolenostoma, Jungermannia); there is development of a border of narrow elongate cells of the perianth* in three (Nardia, Euso- lenostorna, Jungermannia); there is development of extremely large, homo- geneous oil-bodies lying only 1-2-3 per cell in two genera (Nardia, Soleno- ftoma caespiticia).t KEY TO GENERA AND SUBGENERA 1.

TIhis is one of the very common species, since it has a very wide ecological amplitude, occurring under a great variety of conditions. It may be found on moist, somewhat calcareous, shaded sandstones, associated with such species as Plagiochila, Jungermannia lanceolata, Ptilidium pulcherrimum (as in Houston and Winona Counties), on moist rocks at the edges of periodically wet depres- sions, associated with Scapania degenii and irrigua (as on Sailboat Island). The species, on such sites, occurs on essentially mineral substrates, with little or no humic materials, and may be a pioneer species; it occurs here at a pH of from 5.5 to 7.0. Such occurrences are, however, more or less infrequent. More commonly, the species occurs on decaying logs (and the resulting humus), associated with such xylicolous forms as Blepharostoma, Lepidozia, Scapania apiculata and glaucocephala, Cephalozia media, Lo- phozia ascendens, Anastrophyllum (Crossocalyx) hellerianum, and occasionally Lophozia porphyroleuca, Odontoschisma denudatum, Riccardia palmata, R. latifrons, Jungermannia lanceolata. The measured pH range, under such conditions. varies from 4.5-5.2, but may possibly go considerably lower. Under shaded conditions the species is usually largely or quite green, but most commonly it occurs under more intense insolation and is partly or largely reddish-tinged. This reddish pigmentation serves to separate it from other entire-leaved species with lateral branches and small trigones, leaving possible confusion only with Odontoschisma (which, unlike Jamesoniella, has stolons). Sterile material of this species (unless reddish-pigmented) is very difficult to keep separate from some other species that may occur with it. Confusion in the field is very likely with Jungermannia lanceolata, with which it is often together, on both rocks and decaying logs. The latter has, on well-developed plants, considerably more elongate leaves (compare Pls. 29:10; 30:2, 6); under the microscope the larger, distinctly bulging tri- gones of the jungermannia (at least on older leaves) serve to separate it from jamesonie.l- la, which has the trigones always with concave sides (P1. 29:11-12). The species occa- sionally grows on rocks together with forms of Plagiochila that are difficultly separable from it. The tendency, at least on well-developed plants, for the dorsal leaf-margin to be reflexed (P1. 35:3), together with the more or less decurrent leaf-bases, will separate the Plagiochila from jamesoniella, which never has the dorsal leaf margin reflexed (P1. 29:4). The somewhat rounded-rectangular or quadrate leaves of jamesoniella, on mature plants averaging scarcely to slightly longer than wide (P1. 29:4, 10), will help in separat- ing the species. Most plants have occasional shallowly notched leaves (P1. 29:10), whose occurrence will automatically serve to identify the species, since such retuse leaves do not occur in other entire-leaved species (except the very different Chiloscyphus). In the field confusion with Chiloscyphus may be possible: the latter, however, has usually less chlor- ophyllose, more hyaline leaves, with very thin cell-walls (compare Pls. 37:3 with 29:11- 12), and has very distinct underleaves, with the rhizoids limited to a region at their base (P1. 37:4-10). When fertile, the ciliate perianth mouth (P1. 29:4-6) is absolutely distinctive, and separates jamesoniella from all our other entire-leaved Hepaticae.

P1. 30:1-6 Distributed much as Jamesoniella throughout the northern half or more of the Decidu- ous Forest Region, and throughout the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, but not or scarcely into the Arctic-alpine. In Minnesota its distribution is identical with that of Jamesoniella, and extends into southeastern Minnesota. This species has a very similar ecological distribution as lamesoniella but is lacking around calcareous rock pools. It may occur on sandstone rocks, under shaded, somewhat moist conditions, associated with Jamesoniella, Scapania mucronata, Ptilidium pulcherrimum, etc., as at Winona and Houston and Washington Counties, where the pH approaches 7.0. It is more common, however, on moist soil, either largely mineral or with a high humic content, where it may occur together with Blepharostoma and Lepidozia, occasionally with Lophocolea minor. It also occurs on decaying logs, and the resulting humus, there associated with Lophozia porphyroleuca, Riccardia, etc. Here the pH is considerably lower, between 4.5-5.2. The species is typi- cally a mesophyte, rarely occurring under strongly intermittent moisture conditions, and usually found in areas where most of the light is indirect. When sterile, well-developed plants can be recognized in the field by the distinctly elongate rectangular leaves (P1. 30:2, 5-6). These are usually somewhat narrower and longer than in Jamesoniella (compare Pls. 29:10; 30:6), and are somewhat rounded at the apex, rarely truncate-retuse. Under the microscope distinctly bulging trigones of mature leaves are usually evident. When fertile (and this is almost always the case, since the plant is paroecious), the cylindrical smooth perianths, suddenly truncated at the apex, and contracted into a small slender beak, set in a shallow depression, are absolutely dis- tinctive (P1. 30:5). The species is almost never reddish-tinged.* The species is considered to produce gemmae extremely rarely. However, in Minneso- ta, Michigan and Wisconsin I find that much of the material collected is gemmiparous. I have seen gemmiparous plants from the following stations: Wisconsin: near Bayfield; on Sand I., Apostle Isls. Michigan: Copper Harbor. Minnesota: Taylors Falls; White- water State Park. The gemmiparous plants are quite distinctive, since they produce gem- mae on suberect or erect shoots with vestigial leaves, much as in Lophozia heterocolpa or Odontaschisma denudatum. Such gemmiparous shoots are usually rather infrequent, but in the material collected over damp humus at the side of a path in Whitewater State Park the sterile plants were largely gemmiparous. The ability to develop such erect gem- miparous shoots does not recur again in any other genus or species of Jungermanniaceae and appears to be a good supplementary generic character for the separation of J. lan- ceolata. The plants usually have all of the leaves without rounded or truncate-round apices. In plants from swampy, shaded sites (as in Cedar Swamp on Big Susie I., S 12115), the plants develop unusually narrow leaves whose truncate apices are often somewhat retuse (P1. 30:6). Such plants are further atypical in that the cells almost totally lack trigones. Such plants, when sterile, are difficult to separate. In them recourse must some- times be made to the oil-body characters. The oil-bodies occur mostly 7-11 per cell and are slightly granular in appearance (due to the numerous slightly defined contained oil- globlets); they average 5-7 u and spherical to 5-6 x 10 ja and ovoid. The cuticle is dis- tinctly verruculose to striolate, even in bog forms. Distribution.-CHISAGO: Taylors Falls, S 1323a.

The subgenera are differentiated in the key to genera (p. 389). Sterile material of this genus is often virtually impossible to determine, especially if oil-bodies are no longer present. It is extremely important in this group to correctly determine whether the plants are paroecious (e.g., have the male bracts situated below the female inflorescence), or are dioecious. * KEY TO SPECIES 1.

S. (E.) spbaerocarpum * The Nearctic species of this genus never produce gemmae (which are of excep- tional occurrence in the Jungermanniaceae as a whole). In this regard, Solenostoma stands in sharp contrast to jungermannia lanceoldta. However, Hattori (Journ. Hattori Bot. Lab. No. 3: 41, fig. 36, 1948) describes a Japanese species, Plectocolea rubripuncta Hattori, which clearly belongs in Plectocolea (s. str.). This species is described as with numerous round, unicellular purplish gemmae. It therefore breaks down one of the distinctions which might otherwise be maintained between Solenostoma (incl. Plectocclea) and Jungermannnia. One other species of Eusolenostoma occurs in Europe; this will probably be found in North America eventually. Since it keys out (below) to S. sphaerocarpum because of the paroecious inflorescences, it may be separated by the following key at this point: 1. Shoots all with normal leaves: no small-leaved innovations present; perianth not subtended by a discrete perigynium (at most with a very low vestigial ring at base) ------------------------------------------S. sphaerocarpum 1. Shoots dimorphic: some small, slender, with distant, reduced leaves; plants with habitus of S. crenulata; perianth subtended by a perigynium up to 0.2-0.35 as high as free perianth ............- . S. pusillum t Sterile material of Cryptocolea imbricata may be keyed out here. This differs at once in that there are oil-bodies formed of distinct coarse globules (giving the oil-body a grape-cluster like appearance) and in that sterile leaves have a very broad line of attach- ment. In S. sphaerocarpum the oil-bodies are smooth, and nearly homogeneous in appear- ance, while the sterile leaves are fully as wide as long but with a somewhat constricted base.</page><page sequence="141">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 397 2.

SPHAEROCARPUM (Hook.) Steph. P1. 30:7-10 Essentially Arctic-alpine in distribution, with a restricted distribution in the northern edge of the Coniferous Region. In Minnesota strictly restricted in occurrence to the periph- ery of Lake Superior. This species is generally a pioneer on moist rocks, or invades soon after colonization by pioneer species. It is generally considered as an oxylophyte, but in our region appears to tolerate subbasic conditions, occurring with such calciphytes as Scapania cuspiduligera, Lophozia heterocolpa, and Pellia fabbroniana (as at Manitou R.). It also invades thin soil in crevices of rock-walls, often with such calciphytes as Preissia quadrata and LophoZid badensis (as at the Cascade R.); occasionally, on rather dry rock-walls, it occurs with Scapania mucronata (as on Belle Rose I.).</page><page sequence="142">398 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) The species is rather larger than S. pumilum and its relatives, mostly 1-2 cm long and over 1.5 mm wide; unlike pumilum and its relatives it occurs usually moderately far away from water, at a higher zone from the stream-beds or the lake-edge; the plants are generally a bright, pale green, in exposed sites becoming distinctly brownish (never red- dish or purplish) tinged. The species is almost constantly fertile, and the paroecious nature of the inflorescence can usually be easily ascertained (P1. 30:8); the large, some- what saccate male bracts (occurring right below the female ones), will separate the species from all our other orbicular-leaved forms (such as S. crenuliformis, hyalinum, etc.) except S. paroicum. Sterile plants are most easily recognized by the leaf-cells, which have distinct to slightly bulging, though relatively small, trigones, and have large, obvious, homogeneous appearing rod-shaped or elliptical oil-bodies, usually occurring 6-9 per cell (P1. 30:9). The rhizoids in this species are never purplish, and the leaves are not bordered by a row of swollen cells (unlike crenulatum and crenuliformis); in this the species agrees with Cryptocolea imbricata. S. sphaerocarpum, however, has the well-devel- oped leaves somewhat broader than long, and strongly constricted to the base, often (on fertile shoots) somewhat cordate (P1. 30:7); in C. imbricata the leaves, even of fertile plants, are little or not at all narrowed towards their line of insertion (P1. 34:3). The closest relative of S. sphaeracarpum is undoubtedly S. levieri. However, sterile plants can be told from those of S. levieri by the smaller cells (18-22 /L up to 22-27 at on the margins of the leaves, ca. 25-28 x 32,36 A in the leaf-middle), by the orbicular leaves that (on sterile shoots) rarely are over 1.1-1.2 as wide as long, and by a tendency to have the trigones less salient. Miuller (1942) emphasizes this as one of the differentiating characters, but in my experience, the degree of development of trigones is too apt to be influenced by environmental conditions. As can be seen from P1. 30:8, the cells of S. sphaerocarpum may have large trigones (as salient as those figured by Miiller for S. levieri). When fertile, the lack, or virtual lack, of a perigynium will separate S. spbaero- carpum from S. levieri, in which there is a low but discrete one present. Amazingly, the smaller-celled S. spbaerocarpum is reported as being diploid (18 chromosomes), the large- celled S. levieri as haploid (9 chromosomes).

Muller, Rabenhorst's Krypt.-fl., 2 Ed., 6(1) :552, 1909. This rare species has not been reported from the New World before. It has been found at a single known site in the Lake Superior region, on sandstone ledges, along Lake Supe- rior, on Sand I., Apostle Isls., Bayfield Co., Wisconsin, Sept. 12-15, 1949 (Schuster 17694). Associated species are Mnium, Scapania curta, Jungermannia lanceolata, Plagio- chila asplenioides, Blepharosto'ma trichophyllum, indicating a slightly acid substrate. A second collection, from the same locality (Schuster 17695) is evidently from a subcalcare- ous substrate, since not only the above species, but also LophoZia gillmani and heterocolpa are consociated. The species gives the same general impression as S. sphaerocarpum, to which it appears to be extremely closely related. It shares with the latter species a terete perianth, more or less 4-plicate on at least the apical half, with the apex suddenly contracted into a short beak. The plants are also paroecious, and the leaves are somewhat reniform, wider than long, somewhat reniform-cordate at base, broadly rounded at apex. Like S. sphaerocar- pum, the plants are a pure to deep green, rarely somewhat olive-green (though on drying they often become olive-green). The separation from S. sphaerocarpum cannot be attempted in the field. Under the microscope, however, S. levieri shows larger leaf-cells (in the present collection they are 28-32 ,I along the margins of the leaf-apex, and 34-39 rarely 42 A wide x 35-50 tu long! in the leaf-middle). The cells of the leaf-middle occasionally are slightly smaller and aver- age then 32-36 ,u wide x 40-48 jt long. As in S. sphaerocarpum, the oil-bodies are essen-</page><page sequence="143">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 399 tially bacilliform, homogeneous or nearly in appearance, and occur 3-6 per median leaf- cell; they average 5-6 x 7-9 it in size.* Since the oil-bodies are no larger than in S. sphaerocarpum, while the leaf-cells are conspicuously larger, the oil-bodies do not nearly obscure the cell-lumen, unlike S. sphaerocarpum. A second major differentiation lies in the fact that S. levieri consistently has a distinct perigynium at the base of the perianth. This varies in length from about 1/710 - 1/6 the length of the perianth above; there are usually two, sometimes three leaves borne on the shoot above the base of the foot of the sporophyte. In S. sphaerocarpum there is no, or virtually no perigynium present below the perianth. In this species, as in S. sphaerocarpum, the paroecious condition is often virtuallv impossible to determine after maturity of the perianths, since the antheridia decay and disappear subsequent to fertilization, hence occur at best as obscure remnants in the perigonal bracts. The perigonal bracts are virtually identical in form (and scarcely more concave) than the vegetative leaves. The characteristic, generally 4-pleated, shortly beaked perianths, will separate these two species from dioecious types with which they could be confused, on this account. S. levieri and the similar S. sphaerocarpum show a peculiar- ity in common that will separate them from almost all other entire-leaved hepatics. The rhizoids appear to originate not only from the stems, but often also occur scattered on the leaf-bases, as well as on the perianth (see P1. 30:8). For that reason, leaves which are dissected free often show a number of rhizoids attached, which obviously originate from the leaf-lamina. The widely dispersed origin of the rhizoids found in these two species is quite rare in occurrence; in the species of the subgenus Plectocolea the perigynium is often rhizoidous, at the juncture with the bracts-but in my experience, rhizoids never occur directly on bracts, leaves or perianth in our species of that subgenus. S. levieri normally has very discrete, bulging trigones, and has the average length of the oil-body less than 1V4 the cell length; in S. sphaerocarpum the cells usually show con- cave, rarely slightly bulging trigones and oil-bodies whose length averages over 1V4 the cell-length. The larger cells, larger spores and more robust size of S. levieri (as comn- pared with S. sphaerocarpum) suggests strongly that a polyploid series is at hand here, with S. levieri a polyploid derivative of S. sphaerocarpa. Recent cytological work has indicated an inverse condition proving that we are dealing with established species here, whose cell-differences are genetic in nature. This species is poorly known, yet has had an involved nomenclatorial history. It was first described as Nardia levieri by Stephani (Bot. Centralblatt, 1892, p. 70), and subse- quently transferred by its author to Solenostoma. In 1909 Miiller (in 1905-1916) described it as Haplozia breidleri. Schiffner (1910), soon thereafter, maintained that H. breidleri was identical with the much older Jungermannia scalariformis Nees (Naturg. Eur. Leberm. 2: 463). Muller (1915, in Muller 1905-1916) then claimed the position of Schiffner was incorrect. During the next decade most hepaticologists followed the viewpoint of Schiffner, and used the species name scalariformis for the present plant. Muller (1942) has again gone into the question, and now finds his H. breidleri is identical with S. levieri St., while he again indicates that J. scalariformis is a synonym of J. sphaerocarpa (= Solenstoma sphaerocarpum) and thus not available for use for the present species. The drawings and discussion by Miuller are convincing, and the present writer follows Muller's nomenclatorial changes. SOLENOSTOMA (E.) CRENULATUM (Smith) Mitt.

Very often found in some quantity on loamy soil over sandstone cliffs and slopes, or on loamy- sandy soils, or on loose, friable, often calcareous sandstone (as at Taylors Falls). At the latter station it occurred with Conocephalum conicum and Anthoceros laevis on steep sand- stone slopes and on vertical sandstone walls, under subcalcareous conditions. The species is a typical mesophyte, occurs under somewhat to rather distinctly intense insolation, and appears to be unable to tolerate (or compete on) substrata rich in organic materials; it is therefore usually a pioneer. Although most often under somewhat acid conditions, it may occur on subcalcareous sandstone, with a pH of about 6.0-6.5. When fertile very easily separated from our other species by the sheathing, orbicu- lar bracts, with which the perianth appears "fused" for a considerable distance, and from between which it projects for only a moderate distance (P1. 32:3, 5). The rather gradu- ally narrowed and somewhat pointed, spindle-shaped form of the perianth is also distinc- tive (P1. 32:3, 5), as well as the often (but not always)' reddish rhizoids. Unlike our species of Luridaplozia the leaves are as wide as long and nearly orbicular (P1. 32:4, 7), and the occurrence of the species is more often limited to sites rather distant from water. The oil-bodies in living material are distinct: they are quite large, about 5-6 x 9-16 A, are somewhat papillose, and occur mostly 2-4 per cell. The species is usually a rather transparent, glistening pale or hyaline green, but in exposed sites becomes partly or largely bright purplish pigmented. For separation from the extremely similar S. paroica, see the latter. S. crenuliformis is also extremely closely related but can usually be separated by the slightly swollen, dorsally displaced marginal cells of the leaves, and by the non-undulate leaves and bractst Distribution.-CHISAGO: Curtain Falls, Taylors Falls, S 14605 (pH 7.3; near crenuliformis), S 14600c (? crenuliformis), S 18500.

They appear to represent the form gracillima, in which the swollen marginal leaf-cells are not as conspicuous. Conard (1942) had previously reported this material as Plectocolea crenulata var. gracillima. f The regional material the writer has seen of this species is not quite identical with "typical" European material in the form of the leaves and female bracts. European mate- rial, when well-developed has the leaves, particularly the subinvolucral leaves and peri- chaetial bracts, more or less undulate and very broad (P1. 32:6, drawn from an English specimen). Some of our plants give the impression of being nearly intermediate between typical S. hyalinum and the endemic S. crenuliformis. The relationships between these taxa deserve further study.</page><page sequence="146">402 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Solenostoma (Plectocolea) paroicum (Schiffn.) comb. n. P1. 32:8, 9 Nardia paroica Schiff. Krit. Bemerk. ueber die eur. Leberm. VIII Series, in Lotos, p. 14 (1910). This extremely rare species has been reported from scattered, chiefly subalpine stations in Europe; it has not heretofore been recognized from North America. In Minnesota it occurs in some quantity on moist, shaded, cold sandstone walls and sandstone boulders (lying loose in the streambed), of the small ravine below Curtain Falls, at Taylors Falls, Chisago County. It is a common pioneer here, andl occurs with dioecious plants referable to S. hyalinum, as well as with Scapania saxicola Schuster, Chiloscyphus pallescens, Conocephalum conicum, Phaeoceros laevis (exceptional occur- rence!), Reboulia hemisphaerica and small amounts of Lepidozia reptans and Tritomaria exsectiformis. The measured pH is 7.3. The species is superficially indistinguishable from Solenostoma hyalinum and crenuli- formis, and shares with these the same average size (1.2-2 mm wide x 10-16 mm long), the suborbicular leaves with very broad lines of insertion, the generally purplish rhizoids, and the large oil-bodies (the larger 5-7 x 15-18 A). Fertile female plants are very similar in the conical, tapering perianth, formed of hyaline, narrow, elongate cells, and in the suborbicular bracts that are "fused" with it for at least ?4 its length. S. paroicum differs from these two species chiefly in the larger leaf-cells (at least 36-42 ,u wide by 45-54 i. long), and in the paroecious inflorescences. When fertile the larger spores (21-23 A) and thicker elaters (12 ,U), and the broader cells of the inner capsule-layer (20-25 U wide) offer further distinguishing features. On the basis of the single collection of living plants I have been able to study, the oil-bodies may offer a further distinguishing feature: these occur mostly 5-7 per cell, rarely 2-4 per cell (P1. 32:9); in hyalinum they occur most generally 2-3, rarely 4-5 per cell. The single local collection cannot be referred elsewhere.* In the plants studied a paroecious inflorescence was evident in all well-developed plants; in some less robust plants the leaves below the perigynium were not saccate, and no antheridia were found; these should perhaps be referred to hyalinum. It is not uncommon in other paroecious species to find female shoots with no subtending androecial region. In Lophozia gillmani (differ- ing from the related muelleri almost solely in the paroecious inflorescence and larger cells -i.e., in the same fashion as paroicum differs from hyalinum) we often find many less robust plants with no androecial bracts below the female inflorescence: yet these plants occur in obvious admixture with more robust paroecious individuals. Similarly, in the normally paroecious C. rubella many plants show no male bracts below the female inflores- cences. This does not seem to invalidate the claims of S. paroicum for recognition-since separate male plants have not been found for the species. Distribution.-CHISAGO: Curtain Falls, Taylors Falls, S 14608, pH 7.3. SOLENOSTOMA (P.) CRENULIFORMIS (Aust.) Steph. PI. 31:5-7 This rather rare species occurs largely eastward, in the region east of the Mississippi Valley and of the Great Lakes; it' occurs throughout much of the Detciduous Forest Region, and penetrates northward into the Coniferous Region. It has been reported twice from the Lake Superior region (Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and from Superior Point, Superior, Wisconsin). The latter locality is on the Minnesota border, and the species will probably eventually be found in the state. S. crenuliformis occurs most frequently over moist to rather dry, usually somewhat exposed or shaded shale, or sandstone ledges and cliff walls. Under shaded conditions it * The median cells averaged 45-55 jA long x 36-43 A wide; the oil-bodies measured from 5.5 x 16 ,u to 7.5 x 18 A (when 2-5 per cell), but were smaller when more numer- ous (5-7 per cell), and then averaged 6-7 x 7-8 jA. The large cell size, together with the evident paroecious inflorescence clearly places these plants out of S. hyalinum and into S. paroicum.</page><page sequence="147">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 403 t ~~~~~~~~~.S~~~2 PLATE 32.

Associated on shale or sandstone ledges, one generally finds other pioneers such as Scapania nemorosa, Pellia epiphylla, Reboulia hemisphaerica, Phaeoceros laevis (and occasionally Anthoceros crispulus), or with Soleno- stoma sphaerocarpum, Lophozia alpestris and Scapania Curtd.4 The species therefore occurs either as a member of the Pellid-Anthoceros Associule, or of the Lophozia-Scapania Associule. The species is oftentimes difficult to separate from the very closely related S. hyalinum. It can be told from the latter most easily on examination under the low-power binocular microscope, when the swollen margins of the leaves of the S. crenuliformis are quite evi- dent. Under high powers, this swollen margin is often not easily perceived, and lax- leaved, juvenile sterile shoots may also merely show traces of it. The plants also generally have more suberect leaves, which are somewhat concave and often slightly, loosely sheath the stem. Sterile plants can often be separated on the basis of oil-body characters: in S. crenuliformis these are usually more numerous, and occur 4-8 or more per cell, in the cells of the leaf-middle. They are also often spherical or short-ovoid, more rarely ellipti- cal in shape, and are always over 7 , in diameter, often becoming 6-7 x 11-12 A, occa- sionally larger. In S. hyalinum most median leaf-cells have merely 2-5 oil-bodies, general- ly elliptical in shape and to circa 6 x 12-18 Ai in size. The shape, size and number of oil-bodies per cell is so variable in these two species that this character must be used with caution. Subgenus LURIDAPLOZIA Joerg. SOLENOSTOMA (L.) PUMILUM (With.) Steph. P1. 3 1:4 Almost totally restricted in occurrence to the Lake Superior region in Minnesota; extending south to the St. Louis River. The species has a wide distribution in the Conifer- ous Regions, and extends slightly into the Deciduous Zone to the south, and the Tundra Zone to the north; it is known from a single, isolated station in Iowa. S. pumilum is normally a pioneer species: undergoing ecesis on moist bare rocks, especially in their crevices.. It normally grows in small, thin, often obscure, prostrate patches, deep olive- or even blackish-green in color, and forms a matrix in which other species may often get their start. The species evidently has a rather wide tolerance for basic conditions, since it is common on the moist, bare basalt (diorite) along the Lake Superior margin. Under all conditions, the species occurs as a pronounced meso-hygro- phyte, or even as a hygrophyte. Occasionally it is a pioneer on wet rocks at the water- line, growing on rocks that are submerged at times of high water. Other associated pioneer species are Scapania cuspiduligera (at Temperance R., and at Grand Marais), LophoZia gillimani, Scapania gymnostomophila, Preissia quadrata, Pellia epiphylla and fabbronid.1 Measured pH ranges from 6.9-7.0, but the species obviously has a much wider pH range; it is almost constantly fertile, and produces sporophytes commonly (dur- ing most of the summer, from May to September). The most obvious diagnostic character of this small, paroecious species are the acutely tapering, spindle-shaped perianths (P1. 31:4). These do not occur in any of our other species. The plants are extremely small: 3.5-8 mm long generally, with fertile plants only about 1.25 mm wide, and the distantly-leaved sterile shoots (P1. 31:4) to about 1 mm wide. The species is extremely similar to S. schiffneri, which has similar, distant oval leaves on sterile shoots, has a paroecious inflorescence, and has the same deep coloration and habitat. S. schiffneri, however, has the perianth more cylindrical (P1. 31:1), and rather suddenly contracted to the mouth (its width one-fifth from the apex is almost or * As on Sand Island, Apostle Isls., Wisconsin. f The species is especially common on moist sandstone ledges (as on Sand I., Wisc.); here it forms extensive blackish patches, often associated with Solenostoma crenuliformis and sphaerocarpum, Sc. curta, and the more "basiphile" LophoZid gillmani, Preissia quad- rata, and Tritomaria scitula.</page><page sequence="149">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 405 fully as great as its median width). Furthermore, fertile shoots have the leaves much more nearly cordate-ovate (in pumilum the male bracts are more or less broadly ovate, but the leaves below are narrowly ovate to oblong-oval, and not at all cordate at base). Finally, the leaf-cells in pumilum are rather large (averaging 24-30 ,u long or larger), while they are only 16-22 ,u long in schiffneri. Under the binocular, the only reliable difference lies in the perianth-shape. Subaquatic forms of pumilum (the var. rivularis Schiffn.), however, also have a more or less cylindrical-clavate perianth (as in schiffneri), and may be confused with schiffneri. S. pumilum var. rivulari;, however, is a larger plant (1.25-1.5 mm wide, to 2 cm long), and the leaves have much larger cells, mostly 30-35 /it long in the leaf-middle.

Muller P1. 31:1-3 Rare and restricted in distribution (in Minnesota) to the immediate vicinity of Lake Superior, extending up the gorges of the streams draining into it. Steere (1937) considers the S. schiffneri as a "Cordilleran" species, i.e., one occurring largely in the high moun- tains of the Rockies, with only isolated occurrences eastward. The species extends south- ward throughout much of the upper part of the Coniferous Region, i.e., is essentially sub- arctic-subalpine. It also occurs in Wisconsin and Michigan. As far as known, this species is ecologically very similar to S. pumilum, occurring as a pioneer on moist rocks (especially in their crevices, and spreading from these onto bare rock-faces). Like S. pumilum, the species persists only for a limited time after the ecesis of erect, more caespitose mosses and hepatics, or after such thallose species as Pellia and Preissia come in. S. schiffneri is extremely close to S. pumilum, and sterile shoots of the two are almost inseparable. The leaf-cells of schifineri are somewhat smaller (mostly 16-21 At) than in pumilum. When fertile, the more inflated appearing perianths of schifineri, which remain broad to near the apex, and are then rather swiftly contracted, are quite distinctive (P1. 31:1); in pumilum the distal third of the perianth is gradually and nearly evenly con- tracted: hence the perianths appear somewhat pointed (P1. 31:4). Other differences are cited under S. pumilum. Distribution.-COOK: Grand Marais, C 3010. LAKE: Lower falls of Manitou River, among Sc. gymnostomophila, Lophozia badensis, S 18091, with capsules. ST.

This essentially northern species occurs across the continent from Greenland to Alaska, largely in Arctic-alpine and Subarctic-subalpine regions. It has been reported several times from the Lake Superior region (Wisconsin, Michigan), but has not yet been found near the shores of Lake Superior in Minnesota. The species is more generally distributed in montane areas. 'A pioneer species, usually growing attached to wet rocks, often in areas kept wet by spray or wave-action. Associated most generally with Marsupella and Scapania (undulata, subalpina, etc.). Family MARSUPELLACEAE This small family includes only three genera of essentially boreal or arctic species. As with the Plagiochilaceae, the Marsupellaceae are most easily sepa- rated from other families by the "fruiting" characters. Unlike our other Hepaticae with bilobed leaves and terminal sex organs, the Marsupellaceae have a very reduced perianth (Marsupella) (P1. 33:4) or none (in the two</page><page sequence="150">406 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) extraterritorial genera); when a perianth is present at all, it is a short, tubular, delicate structure, hidden within the large perichaetial bracts, which are erect and extend far beyond the perianth. Therefore, there is no free, exserted perianth present in this family. The family agrees with most Lophoziaceae, with the Harpanthaceae, Lo- phocoleaceae, etc., in having uniformly bilobed leaves (P1. 33:3, 5). Unlike many of these groups, there is no trace of underleaves (P1. 33:3), and the lateral leaves are inserted quite transversely, and are quite symmetrically bi- lobed(Pl. 33:5). The plants have a characteristically erect or strongly ascend- ing growth, growing away stiffly from their substrate (this is almost uniformly bare soil or rock); furthermore, the leaves of the members of our one genus (Marsupella) stand stiffly away from the stem, giving the plants a somewhat pectinate appearance (P1. 33:3). Other characters that are useful in recogniz- ing the family are the very small cells (mostly 12-18 ji in leaf-lobes) that are usually provided with very large trigones; the frequent presence of leafless, stoloniferous branches; the very large oil-bodies, which usually occur only 1-3 per cell (P1. 33:10); the total lack of gemmae or other vegetative reproductive structures. The members of this family are nearly always pioneers over exposed, con- stantly or intermittently moist or wet rocks. They occur usually associated with moist rock-walls, waterfalls, or mountain streams, or the rocky shores of cold lakes. Some of the species occur under even more exposed conditions on mountain-tops.

In Minnesota lim- ited strictly to near the Lake Superior watershed, and quite scarce and in very little quantity. This species is almost uniformly epipetric, or occurs on soil arounct waterfalls, where it is often common in crevices with other pioneers, such as Gymnocolea inflata, Cephalo2ia bicuspidata, Scapania species (nemorosa, subalpina and undulata), and occasionally with Plagiochila asplenioides. Although widely distributed in mountainous or hilly regions, the species is quite rare in the lowlands; in Minnesota it occurs generally within 1-8 feet of Lake Superior, on moist, sheltered rocks of north or north-facing ledges. On Oley (Little Susie) Island, for instance, it is a pioneer limited to rocks that are kept moist by the wash of the lake: under such conditions the species is a pioneer that comes into competi- tion with very few other species (Scapania undulata, subalpina). At Grand Marais the species occurs under similar conditions: but somewhat higher, above the wash of the waves. The plants of this region are generally poorly developed, and only 8-15 mm tall. Such plants approximate the next species in size, but differ from it in the dull green to olive-brown pigmentation (rarely reddish-brown), the dullness of the texture of the plant, the somewhat broader leaves that are not widest at the base, and that are always bilobed ?4 or less their length, with the lobes always much wider than long; furthermore, the better developed leaves clearly have the dorsal leaf-margins narrowly reflexed. Distribution.-COOK: Little Susie (Oley) I., Susie Is., S 7432a; Grand Marais, S; Grand Marais, H. MARSUPELLA SPARSIFOLIA (Lindb.) Dumort. P1. 33:6-11 An essentially high subarctic to arctic-alpine species, very rare in North America and with only a few stations in the Coniferous Forest Region. In the Great Lakes area known only from the Porcupine Mountains, in Michigan (Nichols), and from the single station from Minnesota cited below. The ecological requirements of this species are similar to those of the last: it occurs also usually with similar species (Scapania sp., Gymnocolea inflata, Cephalozia bicuspidata and related species), usually on wet rock walls or on rocks along the edges of streams where it is apt to be submerged during heavy rains. This species can often be told from emarginata by its coloration: it occurs as scattered plants or in patches that generally have at least the leaf-lobes purplish-brown or blackish- often the entire plants being thus pigmented. As with M. emarginata, the plants are erect and nearly or quite simple, but the leaves are generally more distant than in that species. Furthermore, the leaves are bilobed 1/4 - 1/3 their length, with ovate or trianga- lar lobes that are nearly or quite as long as wide (P1. 33:7, 9). The plants are usually only 5-10 mm tall, and often are fertile: with the male bracts below the female bracts, distinctly saccate at the base (P1. 33:6, 11). The paroecious inflorescence, when present, is the surest means of separation from emarginata. M. sparsifolia has a relatively short perigynium, compared to M. emarginata and sphacelata. In my experience, it is merely a low ring, circa one-fourth the height of the perianth, and is often nearly absent on one side (P1. 33:6). This is the condition of the present plants, which show inflorescences shortly after fertilization; whether there is any increase in height of the perigynia subsequent to fertilization is unknown. In any case, the free perianth is always more or less ovoid, contracted to a relatively narrow mouth at the apex, and generally at least twice the height of the subtending perigynium. The plant occurs at its sole known station in Minnesota associated with Diplophyllum apiculatum var. obtusatum, Lophozia alpestris, etc. Though the color is olive-brown, much as in material of M. emarginata, and the facies is that of a small M. emarginata, the structural features of the single collection clearly place it as M. sparsifolia. The leaves are divided to 1/3, with the sinus and lobes generally both acute; the leaves are also clearly longer than wide, with the greatest width slightly above the base. The plants show very large, bulging trigones. All of the fertile plants examined were obviously paroecious, with 2-3 antheridia in the axil of each of the 2-4 pairs of perigonal bracts, below the</page><page sequence="152">408 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) perigynium. The paroecious condition of this species is usually evident (as in the present plants) because several pairs of leaves below the female inflorescence are somewhat larger than the leaves below them, and obviously more strongly concave and erect, rather than spreading (P1. 33:11). Older plants, in which the antheridia have disappeared, occa- sionally appear to be dioecious. Such plants frequently show innovations from below the perigynium, and the apices of these innovations bear antheridial bracts with young antheridia. Distribution.-ST. Louis: Birch Rock Hill, Nopeming, C 3136, August, 1926 (listed as M. emarginata, in Conklin, 1942). MARSUPELLA SPHACELATA (Gies.) Lindb. A montane and submontane species of very rare occurrence in the Lake Superior Region; largely subalpine and arctic-alpine in distribution. Reported by Steere (1947) from Michigan and by Cain and Fulford (1948) from southern Ontario: unknown, so far, from Minnesota. The species has somewhat the same ecological requirements as M. emarginata, but appears more strictly limited in occurrence to montane regions. Normally separable from M. emarginata and sparsifolia by the very large, hyaline, cortical stem-cells. The broad leaves, generally erect or suberect leaves (spreading in the terrestrial form, "M. sullivantii"), the often violet rhizoids, and the rather deep, usuallv acute sinus of the leaves will separate the species from emarginata. Small, impoverished or juvenile forms of emarginata may have more deeply lobed leaves, and are then to be separated from sphacelata with caution. M. sphacelata never has the dorsal leaf-margin distinctly reflexed; in M. emarginata most mature leaves have it obviously, even if nar- rowly, reflexed. Family PLAGIOCHILACEAE This family is most sharply separable on the basis of "fruiting" characters. The perianth, unlike in any other of our liverworts, is sharply laterally com- pressed (thus looks wedge-shaped in dorsal profile) (see Fig. 13:8 and Pl. 35:4). The sporophytes have capsules that retain a wall that is usually 4-7 cell-layers thick. In both of these characters the members of this family differ from the Jungermanniaceae (which most closely resembles it in regard to the vegetative structure). The family is similar to the Jungermanniaceae in having unlobed leaves (Pl. 34:1-4, 7), and in having the rhizoids scattered on the postical stem surface (when present), as well as in having the male and female inflorescences terminal on main shoots (Pl. 34:4), as well as in the collen- chymatous leaf-cells with the walls between the cells usually remaining thin (see Fig. 12:1; P1. 35:5). Unlike our Jungermanniaceae, there is usually dis- tinct retention of small underleaves (distinct mostly only near the stem-apex), and the oil-bodies are composed of clusters of distinct, individually bulging globules-i.e., they are "segmented" (see Fig. 12:1; PI. 35:8). There are only three local genera, each with only a single local species, separable by the following key:* KEY TO GENERA 1.

Gray Figs. 12:1, 13:8; PI. 35:4-8 Common throughout the Coniferous Forest Region; occurring in disjunct outliers of Spruce and Tamarack bogs south of the Coniferous Zone, and occasional in the Tundra. This frequent species occurs constantly associated with Sphagnum, under moist to rather dry conditions: either in peat bogs or muskegs, or on seepage-moistened peat over shaded, north or northwest facing ledges or cliffs. The species occurs almost constantly with various Ericaceous shrubs (heaths), such as Vaccinium oxycoccus and Ledum groen- landicum, and with the following Hepaticae: Calypogeia sphagnicola, Cephalozia pleniceps, loitlesbergeri, media, connivens. In bogs, other species, such as LophoZid marchica, Cepha- loziella elachista, Cladopodiella fluitans are also comnmonly found with it in a definite society, or Mylia Associule. On the ledges of cliffs, these accessory species are replaced by Lophozia incisa and ventricosa (and the related longiflora), Cephaloziella subdentata, Odontoschisma denudatum, and occasionally Cephalozia leucantha. Eleven measurements of the pH from the latter type of site run from 3.7 to 4.3 (centering around 3.9), indi- cating the species is an extreme oxylophyte; it has a considerable tolerance for direct sun- light. This relatively large species (2-4 mm wide and up to 3-8 cm long) can be easily recognized. It usually bears gemmae (P1. 35:6-7) on at least some plants and such plants show a diagnostic differentiation into upper, lanceolate, pointed leaves, and lower, normal, orbicular leaves (P1. 35 :7). No other hepatic with entire leaves has such dimorphic leaves. In addition, the extremely large cells, 45-55 A6 or larger, with bulging, strong tri- gones are very characteristic (Fig. 12:1): no other of our entire-leaved Hepaticae show such very large, strongly collenchymatous leaf-cells. When living leaves are examined, the grape-cluster like oil-bodies (Fig. 12:1; P1. 35:8) are diagnostic. The species is said to "fruit" extremely rarely, but I have found the plants often with capsules (in August-September), as in bog near Orr, bog near Hoveland, and on the Susie Islands. Plants with perianths are quite distinctive, since the perianths are strongly laterally compressed (and look wedge-shaped in dorsal profile) (Fig. 13 :8); similar perianths occur only on Plagiochila, among our genera.

P1. 35:1-3 Widely distributed throughout the Coniferous and Deciduous Forest Regions, almost ubiquitous northwards, occurring far north into the Tundra Region. This very common, extraordinarily polymorphic species, occurs under a very large variety of conditions. In our area, at least, its occurrence is usually bound up with the presence of at least traces of lime in the substrate. Along the eastern margin of the state it is found chiefly over basic or subbasic rocks (sandstones and limestones southward, diabase northward, etc.): it occurs southward with such species as Lophocolea minor, Conocephalum and Mannia rupestris, and with a very large variety of species northward. In the Coniferous region it is found most often on soil over north or northwest facing ledges and cliffs, together with Scapania irrigua, degenii, nemorosa, occasionally Sc. cus- piduligera and undulata or subalpina, and with such lime-tolerating species as Odonto- schisma macounii, Tritomaria scitula, Lophozia heterocolpa, muelleri and gillmani. It persists under more acid conditions, then occurs with Scapania mucronata, Blepharostoma, Ptilidium, but never occurs under highly acid, peaty condiions. In addition to these sites where it is closely associated with rock-outcrops, the species has a more limited distribution in marl bogs and swamps: here it is found in the wet, mucky holes between Thuya trees and around their roots, where the soil is saturated by marly waters: under such conditions the species is found with Conocephalum, Marchantia, Riccardia pinguis and multifida, Moerkia hibernica, and other lime-tolerating species. Twelve pH measurements made revealed a range of from 7.0 to 4.7 (and one abnormally low measurement of 4.1), mostly between 5.8-6.5. This species is so variable that it will continue to "plague" the beginning student for a long time: forms of it will be sought under Jungermannia, Solenostoma, Chiloscyphus, Jamesoniella, etc.-i.e., under most of the leafy forms with entire leaves. When the species is well-developed, the presence of marginal teeth (at least on the apices and posti- cal leaf-margins) is at once diagnostic (P1. 35 :1-2): no other of our liverworts with uinlobed leaves produce such marginal teeth. Unfortunately, the species most often occurs locally as entire-margined forms (P1. 35:3). These simulate many other genera and are hard to identify until the really critical features of the Plagiochila are appreciated. These are: I.-The more or less strongly reflexed dorsal margins (P1. 35:1-3) of the leaves (on very poorly developed plants with nearly circular leaves only the basal portion of the anti- cal leaf-margin may show this to any degree; this recurved leaf-margin becomes more apparent when the plants are allowed to dry). 2.The antical base of the leaves is usually distinctly decurrent: on well-developed plants very strongly so (P1. 35:1, 3). 3. Plants, when occurring in mats, generally show a distinct division into primary, pros- trate, almost leaf-less stems that are rhizome-like, and secondary, ascending leafy stems. 4. Most plants have an olive-greenish color (becoming deep green in shaded plants, some- times yellowish-green in exposed plants; under no conditions are brownish or reddish pigments ever produced). 5.The stem-apices are often more or less decurved (unlike most other entire-leaved species ) . 6. Small, subulate or ciliary underleaves are generally present, at least near the stem tips. Distribution.-CARLTON: Carlton, C 664. CHISAGO: Taylors Falls, H. COOK: Grand Portage, on Mt.

Perianth reduced to a short, tubular structure, laterally compressed, more or less truncate at mouth, hidden between the pair of terminal perichaetial bracts (P1. 34:7). Both perianth and terminal pair of perichaetial bracts situated at the apex of a discrete, shortly tubular peri- gynium lying strictly in the axis of the stem, the perigynium several cell-layers thick, fleshy, over half as high (on the average) as the perianth above. Peri- chaetial bracts in 2-3 pairs, forming an ovoid, compact, closely organized terminal "head," closely imbricate and erect, with merely the terminal portions and lateral margins spreading to squarrose-reflexed. Terminal pair of bracts appearing fused dorsally and ventrally, except on about the apical fourth, forming a bilabiate structure functioning as the "perianth," rather wide and rounded at tlhe virtually closed mouth, which is very distinctly laterally com- pressed; dorsally and ventrally with the line of union of the bracts marked by a sharp keel or wing, which gradually disappears below.

TYPE: Over moist, subcalcareous, slightly peaty soil 1-4 inches thick, over basaltic ledges, 6-8 feet above level of Lake Superior, northwest facing side of Porcupine Islands, Susie Islands, Cook Co., Minnesota, August 18, 1950, R. M. Schuster 18592. Type in collection of author; portions of type in collections of A. W. Evans (Yale University), H. Buch (Helsingfors) K. Muller (Baden), W. C. Steere (Stanford University), A. L. Andrews (Cor- nell), the American Bryological Society, the New York Botanical Garden, the University of Minnesota Herbarium. From the foregoing diagnosis, and the accompanying plate, it is evident that in Cryptocolea we have before us an extremely specialized type, which shows superficial relationships to at least three families of Hepaticae: the Plagiochilaceae, the Jungermanniaceae (s. str., as in Schuster 1951), the Southbyaceae. In the bilabiate terminal portion of the female shoot, there is an approach to Plagiochila, Mylia and Pedinophyllum; these genera also show an approach to Cryptocolea in that they have (in at least most species) oil-bodies of the grape-cluster type, of similar organization, show (most frequently) unlobed and succubously inserted leaves, and show indiscriminately scattered rhizoids. However, they retain wider ventral merophytes, preserve discrete underleaves, and show no tendency towards the formation of a perigynium. Furthermore,</page><page sequence="160">416 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) they do not show reduction of the perianth to the point where it is much shorter than the subtending pair of bracts, and where the bracts take over the essential function of the perianth (e.g., the protection of the developing sporo- phyte). It is, therefore, the perianth proper, and not the immediately sub- tending bracts, that give the shoot apex of the Plagiochilaceae the laterally compressed appearance. The absence of underleaves, as well as the development of a perigynium, would ally Cryptocolea with the higher genera of Jungermanniaceae (such as Nardia and Solenostoma); these, however, show a well-developed perianthl, which generally exceeds the bracts, and show no trace of a bilabiate, fused shell formed by the bracts. There is also nothing similar to the oil-bodies found in Cryptocolea in the nearctic or European Jungermanniaceae so far investigated (see Muller, 1939; see also MS by writer on the oil-bodies of the North American species). The genus Arnellia, of the Southbyaceae, also shows some similarities (probably homoplastic) to the genus Cryptocolea: both have entire, more or less orbicular leaves, with those near the female inflorescence becoming oval to ovate, and distinctly longer than wide; in both there is the development of a perigynium, combined with retention of a reduced perianth whose height is inferior to that of the subtending bracts. Arnellia has opposite leaves and underleaves, and develops a vertical perigynium at right angles to the stem that becomes strongly rhizoidous. In Cryptocotea the leaves are clearly alter- nate, the underleaves absent, the perigynium lies in an axis continuous with the stem, and is non-rhizoidous. The similarities of the two genera seem essentially due to parallel reduction of the perianth associated with parallel development of a perigynium; they do not appear to indicate any close rela- tionship. The Perianth and Perichaetial Bracts: -Various female plants, of different ages ranging from the time of fertilization to the time immediately preced- ing spore-maturation have been studied. In the plants with youngest inflores- cences, i.e., at about time of maturation of archegonia, there is already a dis- tinct development of the pouch-like, bilateral terminal structure, formed by 2-3-4 pairs of subinvolucral bracts that are evident on external examination (P1. 34:8). In longitudinal section, it is seen that another pair of bracts, immature as yet, is hidden within the structure, raising the total to a maxi- mum number of six pairs of subinvolucral leaves (P1. 34:6). The upper pair of these leaves may eventually form the perianth, but, as far as I have been able to see, there is, at this point, no discrete perianth as yet. The reasons why the upper, smallest pair of leaves probably does not represent the perianth will be discussed shortly in connection with differences apparent between the margins of the bracts and that of the perianth-mouth. It should also be clear from P1. 34:6 that at the time of the fertilization of the archegonia there is also no indication, as yet, of the perigynium. Appar- ently the perigynium and perianth are both formed subsequent to fertilization, and, indeed, fertilization appears to be a necessary prerequisite for their devel-</page><page sequence="161">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAL, 417 opment. This is evident from P1. 34:9, where the old (unfertilized) arche- gonial involucre of the preceding season clearly shows that no perianth had been formed. Another feature of interest is evident from P1. 34:6. This shows clearly that female plants, at the time apical growth is inhibited by the formation of archegonia, already show innovation of shoots from below the archegonial region. This is always true (in every plant examined) of plants in which the archegonia were not fertilized; in plants with fertilized archegonia, subfloral innovations are quite unusual. Finally, a feature of some significance is evi- dent from P1. 34:6. In the development of the archegonia, the immature archegonia are protected to some degree from desiccation by relatively large quantities of slime secreted by marginal slime-papillae, situated in some pro- fusion at the apices of 2-3 pairs of bracts directly below the archegonia. When very small, these bracts h-ave their distal margins situated only slightly above the archegonial region, and the slime they secrete appears to be of some signifi- cance in preventing drying out. I have bcen quite unable to find similar slime- papillae on the margins of the subinvolucral and involucral bracts of other genera of leafy Hepaticae. This feature, therefore, appears to be of generic importance. As has been mentioned above, no trace of any structure that can be certain- ly identified as the perianth is evident at the time of fertilization. The inner- most pair of bracts, which are not at all connate at base, do not appear to represent the juvenile perianth, for the following reasons. Firstly, the perianth- mouth does not bear marginal slime-papillae; the apices of the youngest bracts seen at the time of archegonial maturation bear discrete marginal slime-papillae. Secondly, the perianth is a shortly tubular structure, not showing obvious origin from a pair of leaves; the innermost pair of bracts are shaped like bracts, and free apparently to base (at this time). The perianth is a shortly tubular structure, considerably shorter than the innermost bracts. It is, therefore, quite hidden between the latter, and is evi- dent only upon careful dissection (P1. 34:7). Its mouth is virtually entire, and bordered by several rows of cells that have less evident trigones than the cells of the perianth-middle. In the material available, no marginal slime- papillae have been noted, and no distinct origin from two leaves could be demonstrated. Cryptocolea imbricata sp. n.

Underleaves totally lacking even on fertile shoots (beneath perianth often a trace of a bracteole). Gemmae absent. Unisexual (dioecious). Male plants in separate patches from female, or occasionally in same patch. Androecia terminal, later becoming intercalary, often several in succession on one shoot, separated by several sterile leaves; male bracts in 5 or more pairs of bracts, densely imbricate and forming an elongate compact spike; antheridia 1-2 per axil, about 175 ,u long x 144 ,u wide, the stalk biseriate, about 96 gJ long. Female inflorescence terminal on main shoot. Young inflorescences (with mature archegonia circa time of fertilization) with leaves erect near shoot apex, closely imbricate, the basal portion of the leaf strongly ventricose, the marginal portions characteristically spreading, the inflorescences totally hidden beween the distal several pairs of leaves and bracts: these are erect and lie parallel to the stem (except for the spreading, flaring distal margins, which are somewhat reflexed), and are inclined to each other, forming a some- what bilabiate, closed terminal structure, in which the inflorescence lies; no trace of peri- anth at time of fertilization. Female bracts half-way to base with slime-papillae. This rare species appears to be known only from one station: Porcupine Island, Susie Islands, on which the type material was collected by the writer (1950).* Its distribution is therefore not known. The species occurred under subbasic conditions, together with Tritomaria scitula and quinquedentata, Lophozia heterocolpa, Plagiochila, Blepharostoma, Scapania gymnostomo- phila, Lophozi'a gillmani and the moss Fissidens, on thin soil on a moist diorite ledge, only a few feet above the level of Lake Superior. C. imbricata is perhaps most readily confused with two local dioecious members of the genus Solenostoma (e.g., crenulata and crenuliformis). It shares with these the same basic cell-size, is about equally large (1-2 mm wide x 8 mm or more long), and is also dioecious. The plants, however, have rather strongly imbricate leaves (usually as in P1. 34:1, or even more imbricate), and totally lack any trace of a border of swollen or dis- placed cells. The cells, furthermore, are all thin-walled and have rather obvious, but scarcely bulging trigones. The female plants are quite characteristic in that the terminal 2-3 pairs of leaves form a more or less compact "head", during the period before develop- ment of the perianth. Male plants have terminal, and subsequently, intercalary androecia that are quite compact, with the bracts nearly like leaves, but more strongly imbricate. Sterile plants, because of the absence of swollen marginal cells, may be sought under S. sphaerocarpum. As in that species, the leaves are nearly or quite orbicular, and the cells have thin-walls and rather obvious trigones (compare Pls. 30:9 and 34:2). The leaves in imbricata, however, are never wider than long, and are little or not constricted towards their base (compare Pls. 30:7 and 34:4-5).

Family HARPANTHACEAE The members of this family, in the vegetative condition, are very similar to most other lobed-leaved liverworts: They possess uniformly bilobed lateral * More recently material was collected on Amygdaloid I., Isle Royale, Michigan.</page><page sequence="163">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 419 leaves (PI. 36:1-7), and have moderately large, rather obvious underleaves (PI. 36:1-3, 5-7). Fertile plants, however, are very different from other fam- ilies with lobed leaves and rather large, distinct underleaves, in that the androe- cia and archegonia occur on very short, ventral branches, arising from the axils of underleaves (PI. 36:5). The androecia are short, spike-like structures, hidden below the lateral leaves, not at all evident unless a plant is studied from beneath (PI. 36:5). The female inflorescences occur in a similar posi- tion: in all cases there is the development of more or less of a fleshy structure around the base of the calyptra (either the base of the perianth is united with the calyptra below, forming a rudimentary perigynium, or the perianth is alto- gether absent, and there is a rhizoidous, pendent, subterranean perigynium, P1. 36:5). The family, therefore, is separated from other lobed-leaved species by the rather distinct underleaves (Pl. 36:2-3, 6), the short, ventrally originating, spike-like androecial branches (PI. 36:5), and the absence of a free perianth (P1. 36:5). In addition, the lack of restricted rhizoid-initial areas (which separates the group fromn the Lophocoleaceae) (compare P1. 36:3 and 36:8) and the 1:1 spore-elater ratio is distinctive. In the origin of the fertile branches, and in the trigonous perianth (of those genera in which it is preserved), and in the spore-elater ratio the family stands near the Cephaloziaceae. In the general vegetative structure, the pres- ence of small trigones in the leaf-cells and in the distinct oil-bodies, the family stands nearer the Lophocoleaceae (which also has a trigonous perianth, but has the mflorescences on main or lateral branches). Unlike the Lophoziaceae, gemmae are normally absent (occurring, rarely, only in Harpanthus). Two distantly related genera occur locally, separable by the following key: KEY TO GENERA 1. Underleaves ovate or lanceolate, mostly entire, often fused with a lateral leaf (P1. 36:1-3); perianth present, hut no pendent, rhizoidous perigynium; leaf-sinus more or less rounded (P1. 36:1-4) -. Harpanthu.s 1. Underleaves uniformly, deeply bifid, free from the leaves (P1. 36:5-7); perianth absent, replaced by a pendent, subterranean, rhizoidous perigynium (P1. 36:5); leaf-sinus acute to rectangular (P1. 36:5-7) -. . Geocalyx GEOCALYX GRAVEOLANS (Schrad.) Nees Fig. 7:1-2; P1. 36:5-7 Widespread throughout the Subarctic-subalpine Coniferous Forest Region, extending southward well into the Deciduous Region (but only occasionally found there in Min- nesota). This common species occurs under a great variety of conditions, over mineral soil, occasionally over thinly soil-covered rocks, but most frequently over humus or peaty soil (especially when this lies over marl or over basic rocks). Although not a calciphyte, the species has a decided tolerance for subcalcareous conditions. The chief requirements of the species appear to be relatively diffuse light (never direct protracted sunlight), and a very constant supply of moisture. The species occurs over moist, shaded, decaying logs, with the pH about 4.6-5.2, together with such species as Btepharostoma trichophyllum, Lophozia ascendens, Scapania apiculata and glaucocephala, Jamesoniella autumnalis (as at Pigeon Point), occasionally Riccardia latifrons and Jungermannia lanceolata, Lo- phozia incisa and Calypogeia meylanii. Under somewhat similar conditions the species occurs on peaty wood and moist decayed forest-litter, usually with Lophozia incisa and</page><page sequence="164">420 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Cacypogeia meylanii. When occurring on moist peat capping ledges (as on Belle Rose Island and Long Island), there are usually associated the ? oxylophyte Lophozia incisa, L. silvicola, Blepharostoma, and Cephalozia media (species also found with it often on decaying logs and humus); under such conditions the pH may be as low as 4.1. When occurring on more mineral a substrate, as on thin soil over basic rocks, it may occur with Lophozia heterocolpa, Plagiochila asplenioides, Odontoschisma macounii, and Tritomaria quinquedentata, as at Grand Marais and on Little Susie I., with the pH 6.0 (i.e., with subcalciphytes, and under subcalcareous conditions). In my experience the distribution of the species is most often bound up with the occurrence of considerable lime in the sub- strate underlying the organic matrix on which the species occurs: as in Cedar bogs, where it is characteristically associated with Calypogeia meylanii and Cephalozia media. More rarely the species occurs almost directly over moist rocks, then occasionally with A. (Sphenolobus) minutum (as on Big Susie I.). The species still persists when conditions become somewhat more acid, then occurs with the above species, but also with Lophozia incisa and grandiretis, over peaty soil (as on Belle Rose Island). This is one of the easiest bilobed species to identify. Under the microscope the bifid, rather large underleaves, with the linear-lanceolate divisions nearly parallel, entirely un- armed on the outer side, are absolutely characteristic (P1. 36:6-7). Lophocolea may have similarly divided underleaves, but the lobes usually bear a sharp tooth on the outer side (P1. 36:8); in Geocalyx, also, rhizoids occur not only at the bases of the underleaves, but some occur scattered over the rest of the ventral side of the stem (P1. 36:5); in Lophocolea they are limited to a small area at the bases of the underleaves (P1. 36:8). In the field the horizontal, decumbent growth, together with the very peculiar, yellow- green or whitish yellow-green, opaque color are characteristic.* Once the peculiar opaque- ness of the species is appreciated it will be recognized at sight in the field.t On the postical side of the stem the fleshy perigynia are usually evident: when young they are small, spherical, and look like small tubers; when mature they are cylindrical and very prominent (P1. 36:5). No other species with bilobed leaves has such perigynia. Distribution.-ANoKA/ISANTI: Cedar Creek Bog, S 14069 pH 4.2, S 14063 pH 4.0, S 14849.

Throughout most of our area the species frequents decaying logs, where it is associated with the more mesic species, such as Jamesoniella autumnalis, Geo- calyx graveolans, Scapania umbrosa and apiculdta, Tritomaria exsecta and exsectiformis, Lophozia incisa, and Cephalozia species, occasionally Anastrophyllum hellerianum. When occurring in thin soil over cliffs, it is found with Scapania species (nemorosa, undulata), Lophozia ventricosa, etc. This species is apt to be confused with Lophozia species, with Geocalyx, and with Lophocolea. Under the dissecting microscope (and even with a hand lens) the very large, ovate to lanceolate underleaves, which are fused along one side of the stem with the lateral leaves, at once separate it from all of these genera (P1. 36:1-3). No other local species with bilobed lateral leaves has such distinctive underleaves. In the field the pale green color is quite distinctive: this has no distinct yellow cast to it (unlike Geo- calyx); when the plants are dried they very often turn somewhat reddish or reddish-brown (unlike Geocalyx or Lophocolea). When the trigonous, short perianths are present the species is at once determinable by the fact that they occur on short ventral branches and superficially appear to arise from along the side of the stem (rather than appearing ter- minal).

Family LOPHOCOLEACEAE This family includes only two local genera of very different appearance. These have in common the following characters: a trigonous perianth (Pls. 36:9; 37:1) (as in the Cephaloziaceae, but with the third keel postical), which is strongly 3-lobed at the mouth (Pl. 37:1); the perianths terminal on main shoots (Lophocolea, P1. 36:9) or short lateral shoots (Chiloscyphus, PI. 37:1, 11); a 1-1.5:1 spore elater ratio; a 3-5-stratose capsule wall; distinct, deeply bilobed underleaves (Pls. 36:8, 10-11; 37:4-10), each lobe of which is armed with a lateral tooth or lobe; lateral leaves that are bilobed or emarginate (P1. 36:8) to entire (P1. 37:1, 11) (but the leaves of the female inflorescence always lobed, P1. 37:1, 11); large, pellucid leaf-cells that are non-collenchyma- tous, i.e., lack trigones (P1. 37:3); oil-bodies of the grape-cluster type of mod- erate size, occurring several per cell (Pl. 37:3); a distinct restriction of the rhizoids to small initial areas at the bases of the underleaves (Pls. 36:8; 37:5);* antheridia one per bract, situated in the inflated antical base of the bract (P1. 37:1). In the restricted rhizoid-initials (Pls. 36:8; 37:5), the members of this family differ from all other local genera of Jungermanninae (and a!gree with the suborders Ptilidiinae and Porellinae); since this character is usually very easily evident, the members of the family can be readily separated, even when sterile. In the trigonous perianths the family resembles the Harpanthaceae (but these have postically arising female branches and a more or less fleshy perigynium present), and the Cephaloziaceae (although these have the third keel of the perianth dorsal, lack underleaves or have them minute, and nearly * Rhizoids may not be developed on the base of every underleaf, but may be restricted to occasional underleaves (as in P1. 36:8). Even when no rhizoids develop, the rhizoid- initial cells stand out because of their smaller size (P1. 37:4).</page><page sequence="167">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 423 or quite lack oil-bodies). Both of the latter families also have indiscriminate- ly scattered rhizoids. The two local genera may be separated as follows: KEY TO GENERA 1.Leaves all or mostly bilobed (P1. 36:8-11); perianth terminal on a long shoot (P1. 36:9), elongate, the calyptra quite hidden within it; androecia spicate, the bracts always bilobed - Lophocolea 1. Leaves all or almost all entire, more or less quadrate-rectangular or rectangular (P1. .37:1, 8, 11), but often retuse at apex (P1. 37:9); perianth terminal on a very short lateral shoot (appearing lateral in position), short, the calyptra usually extending beyond perianth (P1. 37:1, 11); androecial bracts like vegetative leaves, except for a small saccate lobule at the dorsal base, entire at apex (P1. 37:1) -----------------------. Chiloscyphus LOPHOCOLEA Dumort. KEY TO SPECIES 1. Gemmae absent (P1. 36:8); leaf-margins entire (except for lobing) (P1. 36:8-9); plants larger, 1-2 mm wide and 1-3 cm long- 2 2. Paroecious, usually fertile (P1. 36:9): with the saccate male bracts below the perianth; leaves nearly rectangular, little narrowed distally, dimorphic on mature sterile shoots: the lower bidentate, the upper much more shallowly lobed or merely retuse or even entire, dorsally scarcely or little decurrent (P1. 36:8, 9) ------------- ----------------------------------------------------L. heterophylla 2. Dioecious, usually sterile; leaves rhomboid-ovate, much narrowed distally, uniform- ly bilobed throughout and with lanceolate-acuminate lobes; dorsal leaf-base long- ly, obviously decurrent - [L. bidentata] 1. Gemmae present, consisting of spherical clusters of cells, usually giving the leaf- margins an erose, ragged appearance (P1. 36:11); plants small, 0.5-0.8 mm wide x 18 mm long, usually sterile; yellow-green -L. minor LOPHOCOLEA HETEROPHYLLA (Schrad.) Dumort. P1. 36:8-9 Extremely widely distributed throughout the Deciduous and Coniferous Forest Regions; often nearly ubiquitous. This common, variable, and often difficultly recognizable species is one of the most abundant and "aggressive" species of leafy Hepaticae. In disturbed woodlands, where burning and cutting have eliminated almost all other Hepaticae, it often still manages to survive: hence it is one of the few species commonly found in the greatly disturbed deciduous forest areas of southeastern and central Minnesota. The species has a wide ecological amplitude: growing under very variable conditions, on soil under trees, on loamy banks, on the lower portions of tree-butts and around exposed roots, and even more commonly on decaying, decorticated logs. Under the latter conditions it occurs most often with Nowellia, Odontoschisma denudatum, various Cephalozia species, occa- sionally Lepidozia reptans and Blepharostoma, and Jamesoniella autumnalis. Occasion- ally it grows under such disturbed conditions that no other Hepaticae have survived. Northward it is also a characteristic species of dried bogs, occurring beneath Chamea- daphne and Ledum, in small moist pockets on peaty soil (there occasionally with Mylia and Lophozia mildeana and marchica, although these usually inhabit less xeric bogs). In coniferous regions it also may occur on loamy soil along brooks, associated with Scapania irrigua and paludicola. The almost constant fertility of the species (P1. 36:9), together with the generally (but not constantly) evident dimorphism of the leaves (P1. 36:9), as well as the limited rhizoid-initial region at the bases of the underleaves (P1. 36:8), are enough to identify it. The plants vary from a rather pellucid whitish-green (when shaded) to a light yellow green. The rather transparent form and evident delicacy are shared with other Lopho-</page><page sequence="168">424 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) coleaceae, and separate the species from such more opaque species as Geocalyx and Lophozia species. It differs from these also in the very thin-walled, transparent cells (much as in Chiloscyphus, P1. 37:3). Except for a few Leiocolea species it is our only hepatic with bilobed leaves that has a paroecious inflorescence (almost universally deter- minable). Sterile and juvenile plants often have all of the leaves nearly uniform, with the upper bilobed in an identical manner as the lower. Such plants are apt to be mistaken for L. bidentatd, a dioecious, usually sterile species that has not yet been found locally. L. heterophylla, however, has the leaf-lobes at best acute, never terminated by a filament of several cells in a single row; in L. bidentata the leaf-lobes are much more distinctly acuminate.

LOPHOCOLEA MINOR Nees P1. 36:10-11 Widely distributed throughout the eastern half of the state, usually associated with basic rock outcrops: occurring in both the Deciduous and Coniferous Regions with nearly equal frequency, and on either sedimentary (sandstone) or igneous (basaltic) rocks. This small, common species is a distinct calciphyte, rarely occurring under a pH of less than 6.8, often up to 8.2. It may occur directly over basic rocks, such as sandstones or diorite, or in their crevices, but more often occurs as scattered plants, among mosses. It is then apt to be overlooked. Very commonly the species occurs over banks or on thin soil over basic rocks, such as over sandstone talus slopes. Commonly found with it are other calciphytes, such as Preissia and Reboulia, occasionally Plagiochila and Chiloscyphus pallescens.* Unlike the related L. heterophylla (which generally "avoids" such basic sites), L. minor appears never to occur in bogs or swamps, but always occurs over mineral substrates. The basic sites, together with the generally epipetric occurrence, characterize this species. The small size (usually only 0.5-1.0 mm wide or less) and the presence of numerous globular, many-celled gemmae (P1. 36:10-11) at once separate it from L. hete'- ophylla. The plant reproduces almost exclusively by gemmae and is otherwise generally sterile; gemmae-formation often gives the plants a dusty yellow-green appearance, and the leaves of such plants are much eroded and highly irregular (P1. 36:11). Lophozia bad- ensis often occurs on similar sites (but more frequently under moister conditions), and is scarcely more delicate; it differs at once in the lack of gemmae and in the absence of underleaves. The beginner may confuse L. minor with other Lophozia species bearing * And not infrequently Scapania mucronata and Lophozia excisa (as at Fort Snell- ing) or Lophozia barTata and Tritomaria quinquedentata (as at Oak Island).</page><page sequence="169">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 425 yellow-green gemmae: these consistently lack underleaves, and have the gemmae angulate and only 1-2 celled.

CHILOSCYPHUS 'Corda The genus Chiloscyphus includes entire-leaved species, which superficially can be confused with other entire-leaved Hepaticae (Plagiochila, Jungermannia and Jamesoniella, in particular). It differs from all of these in several ways, even in the vegetative state: the rhizoids are restricted to small areas at the bases of the underleaves (PI. 37:5), the leaf-cells are extremely thin-walled and lack all trace of trigones, and the oil-bodies are composed of many small, individually protruding oil-globules (P1. 37:3). When fertile, the short, deeply 3-lobed perianths (beyond whose apices the calyptras usually protrude, as in PI. 37:1, 11), and their position on extremely short lateral shoots are significant. The male inflorescences in this genus are quite inconspicuous, because the male bracts are identical with normal leaves, except that the anti- cal base bears a small, infldxed tooth or lobe (beneath which the single anther- idium lies); these can be seen in PI. 37:1 (leaves just above perianth). Both of our species produce aquatic forms. The writer has had little exper- ience with these locally, but the aquatic phases of C. pallescens, at least, appear to be frequent locally. See in this connection Moyle (1937), whose materials have not been seen, and whose records I have not, therefore, included. Muler (1942a) has most recently reviewed the genus.

Dumort. PI. 37:1-5 This species is frequent to common throughout almost the entire Deciduous and Conif- erous Regions (in Minnesota); it becomes rare or absent as the upper edge of Coniferous Forests is approached. C. pallescens occurs almost indiscriminately on either calcareous or subcalcareous sandstone walls (as in Minneapolis and in southeastern Minnesota, associated with Preis- sia, Reboulia, Lophocolea minor, Riccardia pinguis), or the mineral soils resulting from its disintegration, or over organic materials. On sites rich in organic materials, it occurs very often with Riccdrdia species (multifida, pinguis), Moerkia, Lophozia schultzii, Plagio- chila asplenioides, and other lime-tolerating species, generally in Cedar Swamps and Bogs (as at Grand Portage and in Itasca Park). Occasionally it is found on more peaty soils or decaying wet wood (then with various Lophozia sp., Odontoschisma denudatumn, Lopho- colea heterophylla, Riccardia latifrons, etc.), on more acid sites. In the eastern United States, at least, the species appears to occur most often associated with circumneutral or basic conditions (or at least with sites underlain by lime). The measured pH ranges from 6.0 to 7.4, with most readings near 7.0. The species is either a mesophyte or hygro- phyte. Under hygric-hydric conditions it is replaced by the next "variety," which proba- bly represents merely a hydrophytic modification. The species is characterized by the hyaline, scarcely chlorophyllose, whitish-green color, the large leaf-cells (mostly 36-45 A to 40 x 50 /u or larger in leaf-middle), and the more or less dentate lobes of the perianth-mouth (P1. 37:1). The leaves show a pronounced tendency (especially at the bases of the branches) to be retuse or bilobed (P1. 37:1), but this occurs occasionally also in polyanthus. Unlike the following varietv, the typical species is generally a mesophyte, occurring relatively rarely under extremely boggy conditions. In swamps it tends to grade into the "variety" fragilis (the latter being possibly a mere hygric modification). Unlike C. polyanthus, the leaves of this species are normally almost perfectly rectangular (P1. 37:1). Distribution.-ANOKA/ISANTI: Cedar Creek Bog, S 14859, S 14071, S 11540.

According to the literature this form supposedly does not occur in flowing water; this is scarcely true in North America, where I have found it also in streams. The variety, if it is distinct from pallescens, differs chiefly in the duller green color (often a pale olive green, much like Plagiochila). Associated with the aquatic habitat, there is a tendency for the underleaves to be largely destroyed on the older portions of the shoots (P1. 37:7-9), and in my experience, rhizoids are developed to a more limited degree (PI. 37:8).

Corda P1. 37:10-11 Occurring widely throughout much of the Coniferous and Deciduous Forest Regions. In Minnesota the species is scarce and limited largely to the eastern edge of the state, because of its mesic habitat requirements. The occurrence of this species, in general, is not unlike that of C. pallescens, though it occurs less frequently in swampy or boggy sites. The species has not been collected sufficiently often in Minnesota to indicate any differences in ecological requirements from C. pallescens. This species, like typical pallescens, is less branched than the aquatic rivularis. It differs from pallescens chiefly in the less whitish-green (more generally yellow to pure green) color, the smaller leaf-cells (mostly about 25 x 33-35 ,u in the leaf-middle), and in the non-dentate lobes of the perianth (P1. 37:11). The leaves, also, tend to be less distinctly rectangular, and are more often somewhat rounded distally; this distinction is slight and not constant. The leaf-cells in terrestrial polyanthus are but little smaller than those of the aquatic C. pallescens var. fragilis. The aquatic phase of polyanthus (var. rivularis), however, has notably smaller cells. Distribution.-COOK: Hungry Jack Lake, C 2294.

Loeske Occasional in the eastern portion of the state, both in Deciduous and Coniferous Regions, occurring south into Iowa; apparently local and uncommon. In Minnesota largely limited in occurrence to the swift streams running into Lake Superior, where it is locally quite common in the upper portions (above the ravines). Moyle (1937) reports it from a number of streams in this region. The pH of the water here varies from 6.0 to about 7.0. This variant differs from all other forms in the genus in the dark green color it gener- ally possesses; in the almost constant occurrence in swiftly flowing streams; and in tlle unusually small leaf-cells. These are mostly 20-24 St in the distal parts of the leaf (and here nearly isodiametric); in the middle of the leaf they become elongate and 20-25 ,b wide x 22-28, occasionally 32-35 U long. Distribution.-COOK: International Boundary, MacM. 53. Family SCAPANIACEAE The Scapaniaceae are an easily recognized family. They can be distin- guished from all other families of leafy liverworts by the fact that they have 2-lobed leaves, with the dorsal lobe varying from very much (P1. 39:1) to slightly (Pl. 39:7-9) smaller than the ventral lobe, and more or less sharply bent over the ventral lobe: the leaves are thus complicate-bilobed, and the two halves of the leaves have the connecting region acutely bent (the "commi- sure") and always keeled for at least part of its length. In addition, the leaf- margins of the various species usually (but not always) have the ability to develop fine marginal teeth (Pl. 51:1-5, 9, 11) -a character found among our genera only in the otherwise entire-leaved Plagiochila. Unlike all our other</page><page sequence="173">1953 SCIHIUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 429 families of Jungermanninae, the perianth is always more or less dorsiventrally flattened and spade-like, hence is distinctly elliptical to linear when seen in cross-section (Pls. 38:11; 44:10). There are never any traces of underleaves (P1. 39:5). Geminae are extremely commonly produced in this family, and usually present on at least some plants in every patch (Pls. 39:2, 8; 40:1, 12). The Scapaniaceae are very well represented in the region. Since the two genera and numerous species are often extremely similar, they are among our most difficult Hepaticae to identify. The family is closely related to and probably derived from the Lophozia- ceae with transversely inserted bilobed leaves: Anastrophyllum minutum or Tritomaria, with their concave, channeled leaves, being suggestively similar (compare Pls. 23:2 and 26:5 with Pls. 38:11; 44:10). Such Lophoziaceae with transversely inserted, canaliculate leaves may be mistaken for Scapaniaceae by the beginner, but they always have the leaves merely convexly folded, with no distinct angle or keel formed at the juncture of the dorsal and ventral halves of the leaves. Furthermore, the Lophoziaceae have the leaves with entire and more or less subequal lobes, while most Scapaniaceae have at least a suggestion of marginal fine teeth, and the lobes are mostly unequal. The generally very unequal lobes of the Scapaniaceae appear to form four rows of leaves, when seen from above (P1. 38:10, etc.). The combination of bilobed- keeled leaves, with the dorsal lobe smaller than the ventral, is always enough to identify the members of this family. When perianths are present, their distinctly flattened form is also distinctive: in most species (P1. 44:10) all the folds are lost except the sharp one on each side. In the identification of the species, certain terms used are not used else- where: the keel (PI. 51:11K), or region where the fold between the dorsal and ventral lobes occurs (the commisure is another term for this region, and does not necessarily connote a sharp bending over region); the perianth is said to be scapaniate when strongly flattened (Pl. 44:10), without folds (except on the sides), and broad at the truncate mouth. The relative length and width of the ventral lobe are also important characters to note: these must at first be actually measured with a micrometer, but can later usually be estimated -with enough accuracy.* It is also important to note whether the base of the * The length of the dorsal and ventral lobes is measured from the insertion of the keel to the point (or apex) of the respective lobe. The width is measured across the widest point of the respective lobe. The length of the keel is also an important character to note (especially as regards the length of the ventral half of the leaf, or ventral lobe); this is also measured from the insertion of the keel, out to the apex of the keel. In such species as Scapania paludicola, with, strongly arched keels, the keelar length usually must be estimated. It must be stressed that in Scapania we always find a narrowing of the ventral lobe correlated with a juvenile or impoverished condition. For instance, the broad-lobed spe- cies, Scapania irrigua, when poorly developed or juvenile, has narrow leaf-lobes less than 0.8 as wide as long; such plants are very difficult to separate from narrow-leaved species such as Scapania mucronata. This distressing phenomenon must always be kept in mind in determining species of Scapania. It should be noted that allometric growth (hetero- gonic growth) of this type is not limited to the Scapaniaceae but it becomes an important limitation in the Scapaniaceae, even to the specialist, in the circumscription of species.</page><page sequence="174">430 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) leaf runs down the stem or not: if it runs down, as a narrow strip several cells wide, to a point below where the keel (or median part of the leaf) is inserted on the side of the stem, it is called long-decurrent, or decurrent (PI. 51:2, 4, 14); if it runs down merely to this point (or at most slightly below, and merely as a strip a single cell wide), then it is called non-decurrent (Pls. 45:1- 2; 46:2; 39:5).* The family includes two distinct genera in our region, of which one in- cludes four subgenera in our area. These may be separated as follows: KEY TO GENERA AND SUBGENERA 1. Gemmae irregular: spherical with protuberant angles, making them more or less star-shaped (P1. 38:7, 9); leaf-lobes extremely elongate: the ventral mostly 2.5-3 times as long as wide, narrowly lingulate (P1. 38:3-6, 8), towards the apex with the cells small (P1. 38:2, 12): merely 7-15 A on the margins; ventral lobe near its base distinctly crenulate by projecting cells (PI. 38:13); dorsal and ventral lobes directed in obviously different directions (P1. 38:3-6, 10); commisure not or weakly keeled; perianth contracted to mouth, distinctly plicate (P1. 38:11). ---------------------------- ------------------------------Genus Diplophyllumn 1. Gemmae smooth, ovoid or elliptical (P1. 39:2, 4, 10); leaf-lobes circular to broadly ovate or broadly strap-shaped, or reniform, but never narrowly lingulate: from 0.8-2.3 as long as wide (Pls. 39:5, 11; 46:2-3), with the cells near the apex 15-21 au or more (Pls. 39:6; 44:8); ventral lobe never crenulate near base by projecting cells (P1. 39:5, 7)T - -Genus Scapania 2 2. Cells, except near margins, each with a very large, plate-like brownish oil-body, largely filling the cell cavity: persisting in dry material (P1. 39:3); dorsal lobe only 1/5 - 1/3 the ventral in size (P1. 39:1, 5); ventral lobe curved, concave: its edges distinctly raised (P1. 39:1); perianth distinctly plicate and contracted to mouth (P1. 39:1); commisure keeled to base -Subgenus Kaalaasia 2. Cells all with several to many small oil-bodies that disappear in dry material (Pls. 45:7-8; 43 :6; 46:8); dorsal lobe 1/3 - 4/5 the ventral in size (Pls. For that reason the student must keep in mind that the key-diagnoses given on the follow- ing pages are based on normal mature plants. Impoverished and juvenile plants can usu- ally be placed after one becomes so familiar with the group that the "behavior" under diverse ecological conditions of the various species is clearly understood. The very diverse opinions and treatments of such recent workers on the group as Miller, Warnstorf, Buch and Schiffner suggest that we are dealing with a plastic group the proper understanding of which follows only after many years of familiarity with the species in the field. Thle ecology of the species (except for such ubiquists as Scapania nemorosa) is sufficiently restricted so that the student thoroughly familiar with the genus will often utilize the occurrence of the species as the most important single criterion in their determination. * It is most important to keep in mind that the degree of decurrence of the ventral and dorsal leaf-bases is appreciably affected by several factors, chiefly: 1. length of the internodes; with lengthening of the internodes, the decurrence usually increases, and vice versa. 2. immature plants and impoverished plants (mod. parvifolia) of species with decurrent leaf-bases generally show only a relatively slight degree of decurrence; an exam- ple is. Scapania nemorosa, in which the ventral lobes are normally decurrent to a point distinctly below the level of insertion of the keel; in juvenile or impoverished plants of this species, the decurrence is at best to the level of the keel-insertion. t The subgenera of Scapania are rather difficult to separate, unless living mateial retaining the oil-bodies is present, and unless perianths are available. For that reason the key to species (p. 435) does not involve the subgeneric categories. Under the sub- genera, which includes more than a single species, keys to the species are given, largely using other criteria than in the general key to species; see these keys on p. 443 and p. 455.</page><page sequence="175">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 431 43:3; 46:3; 51:5); ventral lobe not falcate, more or less convex or flat, the edges decurved or flat (P1. 51:11, 14); perianth strongly flattened, little or not plicate, truncate at the wide mouth (P1. 44:10) - 3 3.

This genus is rather easily separable in the field from Scapania. The ventral lobes are relatively narrow, and elongate, lingulate to strap-shaped, and point nearly straight outward from the stem (P1. 38:10-11), while the smaller dorsal lobes point more nearly forward; this difference in direction of the leaf-lobes, together with their very narrow form, is quite characteristic of the local species. The narrow leaf-lobes are much as in the species related to Scapania curta (i.e., mucronata, apiculata, glaucocephala, gymnostomophila); these species, however, do not have narrowly lingulate ventral lobes, and all but glaucocephala and carinthiaca have the leaves with the commisure keeled to the base; like these species, both the dorsal and ventral halves of the leaves are strictly transversely inserted, without any decurrent bases (P1. 38:3-6). The perianths of this genus, though not too frequently found, differ from those of nearly all species of Scapania in that they are not strongly dorsiven- trally fqattened, and are instead deeply pleated throughout their length (Pl. 38:11). The genmmae, when present, are diagnostic: they are more or less stellate (P1. 38:7, 9). Two species occur rather rarely in the state: KEY TO SPECIES* ;* D. albicans is reported by Macoun (1902) from the Thunder Bay District of On- tario. This is easily distinguished from both our species by the presence of an obvious "vein" formed by elongate, narrow cells, in both dorsal and ventral lobes.

P1. 38:8-13 Throughout the lowlands of the eastern part of North America, in the Deciduous Forest Region, this is the only frequent species of Diplophyllum. It becomes quite rare in the Coniferous Region. In Minnesota it has an extremely restricted distribution in the northern edge of the Deciduous Region north into the southern edge of the Coniferous Region. It is restricted in occurrence to the easternmost edge of the state. The species differs conisiderably in its ecological requirements from D. taxifolium. It tends to occur on moist loamy or clayey soil, or over rocks only after colonization by other species, and is relatively rarely a pioneer species on moderately dry to somewhat moist cliff-walls.* It occasionally frequents moist rocky slopes, where it may occur with Scapania nemorosd (as at Taylors Falls), but is never a pioneer species then, nor occurs in as restricted a man- ner as D. taxifolium. It very rarely forms large pure mats, as does the latter species. The differentiation from taxifolium is given under the latter species. The chief diag- nostic characters are the larger leaf-cells (38:12), averaging on the margins of the ventral lobes 11-16 , wide (occasionally even larger), the presence of an apiculum on the ventral lobes of most leaves (38:8, 10, 12), the smaller size (rarely over 16 mm long), and the autoecious inflorescence. The species is much more frequently fertile than D. taxifolium, and usually occurs in small patches, or admixed with other species. Distribution.-CHISAGO: Taylors Falls, H.

It is possible that this material represents a new species, but since it is known only from a single collection, it is impossible to refer it definitely to a new species. Tentatively, the least objectionable course seems to be to consider it as a variety of D. apiculatum. At the type station, the plant grew intermingled with Marsupella sparsifolia and Lophozia alpestris. Macvicar (1926) states that obtusifolium is paroecious or sometimes monoecious. The present plants seem to be entirely monoecious (autoecious). This collection is of decided interest, since it stands midway between obtusifolium and apiculatum not only in morphological detail; but in geographical occurrence. D. obtusifolium is a western species (California to Canada), while D. apiculatuum is an eastern species, occurring very rarely, in its typical form, into Minnesota (at Taylors Falls, at the very eastern edge of the state) and Wisconsin. The present collection, from the intervening area between the two species, appears to indicate that apiculatum is a sibling species of obtusifolium. When sterile, the present plants can easily be confused with D. taxifolium, because of the obtuse to rounded leaf-apices and somewhat smaller leaf-cells. The smaller size of the plants, averaging less than 1 cm long, the much less coarsely papillose cuticle of the leaves, and the fact that the plants occur on soil (even if over rock faces), will separate sterile plants. It should be stressed that such sterile plants of D. apiculatum var. obtusa- tum must be placed with a great deal of care, since the characters differentiating them from taxifolium are so slight. Since the var. obtusatum is generally fertile, the autoecious inflorescence is consequently easily ascertainable. Distribution.-ST. Louis: Birch Rock Hill, Nopeming, C 1394, 3136, 1843 (listed as D. apiculatum by Conklin, 1942; the -controversial nature of the specimen is indicated by the fact that C 1394 was determined as apiculatuum "tentatively" by Evans, as (ques- tionably) D. obtusifolium by Conklin and by A. Lorenz, while C. C. Haynes who also studied the material thought it "may be [a] new species"). DILOPHYLLUM TAXIFOLIUM (WahI) Dumort. var. MACROSTICTA Buch P1. 38:1-7 In the northeasternmost corner of Minnesota the present species occurs in a limited number of localities. It is an essentially Subarctic-subalpine species, found very rarely into the northern edge of the Deciduous Region, but more commonly into the Arctic- alpine Zone. The species often occurs in very large, but paper-thin mats over north or northwest facing vertical cliffs, usually in extremely sheltered places: such as narrow cuts through cliffs that are only 3-6 feet wide and never touched by direct sunlight, or in crevices of ledges, or in small caves. Here it is associated with such species as Lophozia ventricosa (and "silvicola"), Lepidozia reptans, Anastrophyllum minutum and occasion- ally A. michauxii, and A. saxicolus. The similarity in occurrence is especially notable as regards the A. minutum. The pH requirements are rather low: from about pH 4.5-5.6. The moisture requirements are quite low, but the species seems to occur only in areas where insolation and desiccation are very low. Locally, at least, the species occurs as a relatively strongly dentate or denticulate modification, with both dorsal and ventral lobes closely and often rather strongly denticulate (P1. 38:3-6).' This species is difficult to keep apart from the very similar D. apiculatum, which largely replaces it in the lowlands. It can be told, when sterile, largely by the fact that the marginal leaf cells (as well as the other cells) are notably smaller: averaging abolut 7-10 A wide (P1. 38:2), while they are mostly 12-16 A wide, or more, in apiculatumn: they are only 12-16 ja wide in the middle of the ventral lobe, while they are 14-19 Ai wide in most leaves of apiculatum. The apex of the ventral lobe, furthermore, is usually rounded and obtuse in taxifolium, except for the denticulations that may be present (P1. 38:2-6); in apiculatum most of the lobes end in a distinct sharp point 2-4 cells long. When fertile the fact that taxifolium is dioecious: often with large patches of male plants, with no female ones interspersed, is quite characteristic; in apiculatum the inflorescence is autoecious, with the male shoots occurring on the same plant with the perianths. Although I have seen thousands of individuals from over twenty colonies (probably of clonal ori.</page><page sequence="179">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 435 gin), from northeastern Minnesota, I have never seen a female plant of taxifoliurn locally.

SCAPANIA Dumort. The members of this genus have a distinctive facies (Plates 39-51), which will generally separate them from other Hepaticae. The only nearly related local genus with which it may be confused is Diplophyllum. Scapania differs from the latter genus in several, but not absolutely constant, features. The most important difference, for the general student, perhaps, is the difference in appearance, caused largely by the difference in leaf-shape (compare Pls. 38:10 and 39:1, 8; 44:7). In Scapania the leaves have the ventral half ("ventral lobe") broader, rarely more than twice as long as wide, and never narrowly lingulate as in our species of Diplophyllum. Our species of Scapania have the base of the ventral leaf-margin entire (Pls. 39:5, 7; 51:14); in our species of Diplophyllum the base of the ventral leaf-margin is denticulate by project- ing cells (P1. 38:13). When gemmae are present (and this is very commonly the case), the two groups can be separated at once: the gemmae of Scapania being elongate, more or less ovate or elliptical, and smooth (Pl. 39:2, 10), while those of Diplophyllum bear coarse protuberances (P1. 38:7, 9). Final- ly, almost all species of Scapania have flat, spade-like perianths, smooth except for a sharp fold on each side (P1. 44:10); this type of perianth never occurs in Diplophyllum (Pl. 38:11). The numerous local species may be separated by the following keys. When gemmae are present, the second key (based largely on gemmae-form) usually allows rapid determination. In determining the nature of the gemmae (whether 1- or 2-celled) care must be taken to study mature gemmae, since the immature ones, and small mature ones, are 1-celled even in species with normally 2-celled gemmae.

P1. 39:1-5 Nearly strictly Arctic-alpine, and in Minnesota restricted to the vicinity of the Lake Superior shore. This species is a pronounced calciphyte. It occurs frequently associated with Trito- maria scitula, Lophozia (Leiocolea) gillmani and heterocolpa, Odontoschisma macounii, Plagiochila asplenioides, and occasionally Scapania degenii. The species occurs most frequently in crevices, often with Sc. mucronata, but is not infrequent on more exposed, thin, moist soil over cliffs. In few cases is the species a pioneer species: it occurs most frequently after preparation by other forms, especially Gymnostomum aeruginosum and curvirostrum, etc. The pH range is frotn about 6.5-7.1, as far as measurements made go. The perianths of this species have been very rarely found, previously. In September, 1947, the writer found them abundantly on Lucille, Long and Little Susie Islands, in Cook County. Male plants were found at the Temperance R., Grand Marais and at the Great Palisade. The sporophyte is still unknown. In the field the small size (generally 1.8-2 mm wide and only 8-16 mm long), the creeping habit, and the pure or deep green color, with the reddish-brown masses of gem- mae of the apices of many of the leaves (even far down on the plant) are diagnostic. Our other Scapaniae of similar size (mucronata, buchii and curta) are never deep green, have yellow-green gemmae normally, and are rarely so closely adnate to the substratum. The very small dorsal lobes (with the apices never extending near the ventral leaf- margin) (P1. 39:1, 5), and the often more or less falcate, dorsally concave or channeled ventral lobes, are also characteristic. Under the microscope, the 2-celled nature of the gemmae (P1. .39:2), the very sharply keeled leaves, and the peculiar oil-bodies (P1. 39:3) are at once diagnostic. The latter occur singly in almost all but the marginal and basal leaf-cells, and are extremely large plate-like affairs: they give the cells and entire plant a deeply colored opaque appearance. There are no other species with similar fat bodies. When the perianths are found, their contracted mouth, with the distal half deeply, con- spicuously plicate (P1. 39:1) will at once separate the present form from almost all our other species of Scapania. The present species was placed in Sphenolobus, Scapania, and Diplophyllum, all within a period of a decade. It is clearly related to Scapania in the completely, sharply keeled leaves (the keel often winged), and in the leaf-form, as well as in the smooth ovoid gemmae (PI. 39:2). The little compressed, plicate perianth (P1. 39:1), very small dorsal lobe, and peculiar nature of the fat-bodies (Pl. 39:3) separate it sharply from- Euscapania. It is so distinct from even the lower species of Scapania that it can- not be derived directly from any existing group within the genus. Furthermore, it has almost certainly acquired the sharply, completely keeled form of the leaf-commisure inde- pendently of Scapania (since the lower forms of Euscapania have the keel merely obtuse basally in some species). It is believed, therefore, that this isolated species, first separated subgenerically from Scapania by Buch (1928), should perhaps be removed altogether from Scapania. In that way, the latter genus would be much more sharply and clearly definable. Buch has clearly shown that this species cannot be placed in Diplophyllum (which has different gemmae, a different leaf-form, and has the leaves not keeled basal- 1y). Nevertheless Frye and Clark returned the species to that genus (1946); this in the present writer's opinion marks a retrogressive trend in the taxonomy of the Scapaniaceae. The possession, by both Kaalaasia, and Diplophyllum of a plicate, little compressed peri- anth is, in my opinion, merely independent retention of a primitive feature: it does not necessarily imply close relationship, no more than does the retention of a trigonous peri- anth in Lophocolea and Cephalozia.

Schuster The subgenus Scapaniella was proposed as a genus by Buch (1928) and separated from Scapania latgely on the basis of the fact' that it occurs restricted to decaying wood (xylicolous), and in that it has a border of thick-walled, larger marginal cells, compared with the interior cells, while the leaf-keel is not sharply carinate below. However, in North America I find that Scapania (Scapaniella) carinthiaca occurs only on rock-walls (so far as known), while the new species Sc. (Scapaniella) saxicola also occurs mostly on rock-walls or ledges. In the two species, Sc. glaucocephala and saxicola, the marginal leaf- cells, though becoming thick-walled, do not attain a size superior to those of the interior portions of the leaf-lobes. It is therefore apparent that the char- acters of Scapaniella as a genus are not very sharp, as has been pointed out by the writer (Schuster, 1949). Miiller (1940) also has not accepted the genus as distinct, while Joergensen (1934), like the writer, would regard it merely as a subgenus of Scapania (though he would include the divergent Sc. cuspiduli- gera in the subgenus). The latter species was placed by the writer (Schuster, 1949) in the separate subgenus Buchiella, also recognized below (p. 455). The restricted subgenus Scapaniella should be redefined as follows to in- clude the two nearctic species, Sc. saxicola and glaucocephala: Plants small, merely 2-10 mm tall; the stems merely 8-14 cells high, with the cortical cells not differing in size and shape from the medullary (but often more thick-walled); leaves with lobes narrow, the ventral 0.5-0.8 as wide as long, the lobes jointed, often sharply so, either entire or with marginal, scat- tered teeth; leaf-bases never decurrent; marginal leaf-cells equally thick-walled (except in leptodermous extremes), forming a discrete border, the interior cells rarely with sharply bulging trigones; oil-bodies less than 6 [L long, 4-5 or up to 10-12 per cell. Gemmae always reddish-brown, 1- or 2-celled, arising from acuminate lobes whose inner cells are always larger than those of normal leaf- lobes. Perianth-mouth entire or virtually so, bordered like the leaf-margins. KEY TO SPECIES OF SCAPANIELLA 1.

Evs. PI. 40:1-7 Throughout the eastern half of North America, in the Coniferous Subarctic-subalpine Region.* In Minnesota the species, which is everywhere rare, occurs only in the north- eastern sixth of the state. This species is extremely restricted, as regards occurrence: it is found only on moist, shaded, decaying logs in Spruce-Fir or Cedar-Spruce Swamps and Forests. Its chief requirements appear to be a relatively constant supply of moisture, no more than very intermittent direct light (with the light preference, as far as measured about 1/20 - 1/10 that of normal sunlight), and a substrate rich in humic acids. The species is not a strict pioneer on decaying, decorticated logs, but comes in after decay has set in. On such logs it occurs associated with lamesoniella, Lopbo2ia ascendens, Lepi- dozia, Blepharostoma, and Lophocolea heterophylla, and very frequently occurs intermin- gled among Scapania apiculata. The measured pH of its substrata is 4.6-5.2. The restricted occurrence, together with the minute size (mostly 3-6 mm high), the totally green color, except for the contrasting reddish-brown gemmae, are usually enough to separate this species, except from the very similar Sc. apiculata. Separation from/ the latter, to be absolute, entails study under the high powers of the microscope. In glauco- cephala the leaves are distinctly bordered (below the apices on gemmiparous leaves only) by 1-several rows of equally thick-walled cells, while the inner cells are quite thin-walled (P1. 40:7); in apiculata all of the cells are similar and provided with large, bulging tri- gones (P1. 40:11). The gemmae, when mature, are largely 2-celled in glaucocephala (P1. 40:5), but are always 1-celled in apiculata (P1. 40:8). Both species are very simi- lar also in tending to produce erect, small-leaved shoots, to whose apices the gemmae often are restricted. In glaucocephala these erect-leaved shoots are not as specialized, how- ever, and their leaves are always distinctly, sharply bilobed (P1. 40:6); in apiculata however, the upper leaves of such shoots have more or less orbicular leaves, with virtu- ally no indication of the lobes (P1. 36:9). Evans (1934) first demonstrated this species should go into Scapaniella. With its inclusion, the chief characteristic by which Buch separated Scapaniella breaks down: i.e., the larger size of the marginal cells (P1. 43:1). This holds only for S. carinthiaca and other, European species, but not for our other North American species. The only other character by which the group differs is in the absence of a discrete keel between the dorsal and ventral lobes, except near the tip of the commisure, and in the simple stem anatomy. The simpler structure of the stem (with the cortical cells equal in size to the medullary cells) is also of use in separating the group from Scapania s. str. (compare P1. 43:7 to 50:8). In my estimation these differences are too slight to warrant a distinct genus, and I therefore return the species to Scapania as a subgenus. My reasons are: the keel of the leaves is scarcely sharper in some members of the Curta and Apiculata groups, * Recently reported from the similar zone in Finland by Buch (1946), and from the Deciduous Forest Region by Schuster (1949).</page><page sequence="189">1953 SCIIUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 445 4/ 10.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3 8. 0 9.~~~~~~~~~~2 PLATE 40.

This leaves only the stem-structure as a valid criterion: and this, by itself, is scarcely a generic character. Buch also stressed the fact that the species were restricted to decaying logs as a generic character: but Sc. apiculata is also restricted to decaying logs. Joergenson (1934) first considered Scapaniella as a mere subgenus of Scapania. He, however, also included Sc. cuspiduligera in it. This, to my mind, stresses correctly the lack of relationship of the latter to Euscapania. However, Sc. cuspiduligera is scarcely closer to Scapaniella; it differs in its biology, in its stem-structure (it has very small, flattened-not isodiametric, cortical stem cells, very sharply distinct from the medullary cells); it also has a very different leaf-form and oil-bodies.* For that reason I separate it as a discrete subgenus from both Scapania (s. str.) and Scapaniella. Its leaf-form is so diagnostic that it certainly should be considered more distinctive an entity than Scapaniella. Distribution.-COOK: Pigeon Point, S 6751; Old Iron Trail, nr.

SCAPANIA (SCAPANIELLA) CARINTHIACA Jack PI. 43:1-8 This extremely rare and minute species has been reported from several stations in Europe (one from Italy, one from Germany, a station from Lichtenstein), and one from Siberia; it has not been previously recognized from North America. I found (Aug. 1948) a small quantity of material, on Belle Rose I., Susie Islands, Cook Co. The plants here grew on peaty soil and intermingled dead roots of Ledum and Empetrum nigrum, associated with Lophozia grandiretis, L. incisa, Scapania mucronata, some Trito- maria exsectiformis, Cephalozia pleniceps, Riccardia palmata and also with scattered plants of Odontoschisma macounii, Geocalyx graveolans and Blepharostoma trichophyllum. (See descriptions of this site under L. grandiretis and 0. macounii.) t The plants occurred on the vertical side of the peaty crest over a low ledge, merely 5-6 feet above the level of Lake Superior, on the shaded, sheltered, northwest facing side of the island, in juxta- position to the Arctic-alpine Empetrum. Although only a few well-developed plants were found (now mounted on two slides), it was possible to investigate the stem-anatomy, the oil-bodies, and the cell-structure in sufficient detail to establish beyond doubt identity with Sc. carinthiaca. The most charac- teristic feature of the leaves are the more or less interruped borders of very thick-walled, elongate marginal cells (distinctly longer than the adjacent interior cells of the leaf-lobes * In the oil-bodies it approaches Kaalaasia, rather than Scapaniella, since it has most- ly 2-3 large (9-16 ,u) oil-bodies per cell, which nearly obscure the lumen. Similar oil- bodies do not occur in Scapaniella. t This material was at first believed to represent a nearctic variety or subspecies of S. carinthiaca. A slide of the plants was sent to Dr. H. Buch, for confirmation, who wrote "Ihre subp. parvula von Scapaniella carinthiaca (scheint) mir nur den Rang einer "forma" zu verdienen, solange sie noch nicht durch weitere Funde oder Kulturversuche aufgeklart (ist)." In 1950 a special trip was made to collect more material, and several small patches were found at the original site, associated with the above group of species, and with Cephalozia pleniceps-, Lepidazia reptans, etc. This material included many erect, small-leaved, strongly gemmiparous plants that (by themselves) would scarcely prove determinable, since the leaves were so reduced and malformed that determination was possible only by association with normal-leaved plants. A number of large-leaved shoots were found, showing the typical characteristics of S. carinthiaca. It is therefore probable that the American material cannot be taxonomically separated from the European.</page><page sequence="191">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 447 and up to 19-24 ju long) .* The stems are only about 8-9 cells high, and have a single cortical layer of thick-walled cells, isodiametric in cross-section, and scarcely smaller than the medullary cells. The gemmae are also very distinctive; they are 1-celled, reddish- brown or even purplish-red, and occur in fascicles as in other species of Scapania. They, however, are very small: mostly only 6-9 x 9-12 /J,, and are uniformly 1-celled.t In the plants studied they have often a very characteristic, Bacillus-like shape, with nearly paral- lel-sides and suddenly rounded ends: much like short, stout sausages. The plants agree nearly perfectly with the figures and descriptions by Buch (1928), but differ from Euro- pean material cited by Buch in the much more pachydermous interior leaf-cells: these, though collenchymatous (i.e., with more strongly thickened angles), also have the walls thickened to some degree, and have such large trigones that they are largely confluent. The interior cells thus approach a guttulate condition, and the marginal border of cells differ from the inner cells largely in the more elongate condition of the cells, and the more evenly thickened walls.4 S. carinthiaca can be separated at once by the border of elongate, thick-walled mar- ginal leaf-cells, which are distinctly more elongate than the interior cells of the leaf-lobes. Furthermore, the extremely small size of the gemmae, and their peculiar form (looking like links of short, thick sausages) are quite characteristic. None of the plants I found at- tained a length of over 4 mm. Although generally considered to be restricted to decaying logs (to which Buch, 1928, restricts the subgenus in his diagnosis of Scapaniella), the present collection is of decided interest in that it marks the first time the species has been found on peat. Distribution.?-CooK: Belle Rose I., Susie Isls., S 12231a, 1948; S 18549, 1950, S 18553d, 1950; S 19430e, 1950. * Buch (1928) stressed that S. carinthiaca (in contradistinction to S. massalongoi), showed a very distinct border of thick-walled marginal cells *elongate parallel to the leaf- margin, that extended far down from the leaf-apex. In the present plants there is a great deal of variation in this regard. Some leaf-apices have almost uninterrupted borders of pachydermous marginal cells averaging 16-22 tt long or more. On the other hand, the ventral lobes of some robust plants have the thick-walled cells of the apical portions of the lobes nearly isodiametric, and merely 13-18 x 12-16 ,u, and scarcely or not larger than the interior cells. Such leaves with isodiametric marginal cells of the lobe apices, however, usually show near the bases of the lobes distinctly elongate thick-walled cells, in 2-3 rows, that are 18-22 ,A long x 9-14 It wide. On the basis of the border of thick- walled cells being well-developed below the lobe-apices, the writer places this collection in S. carinthiaca, rather than in the extremely closely related (and only doubtfully specifical- ly distinct) S. massalongai. j In the 1950 collections I was able to find a few 2-celled gemmae varying from 7.5 x 11 ,u to 9 x 14.5 I,, among the smaller 1-celled gemmae. This may suggest that the American material is not exactly identical with European S. carinthiaca. t In some of the material collected in 1950 much variation in the degree of develop- ment of the trigones of the interior cells was noted. Some plants showed bulging, large, often confluent trigones; these showed a whitish-green color often somewhat overcast by golden brownish pigmentation of the walls; such plants would represent a mod. pachy- derma-parvifolia. Other plants, larger and greener, showed concave, relatively small tri- gones of the median leaf-cells, and represent a mod. viridis-mesoderma. ? The second North American station discovered by the writer (Sept. 12-15, 1949, Sand I. Wisc.) consisted of only two plants, one gemmiparous, mingled among Scapania saxicola Schuster, Scapania curta (Mart.) Dum., and the common Pellia epiphylla, on thin peaty soil over sandstone ledges-again a bryochamaephytic occurrence. When com- pared with Sc. saxicola, several differences immediately appear: the cells of Sc. carinthiaca are much more regularly arranged, in concentric arcs from the leaf-apex outward, and the cells are sharply rectangular, box-like affairs (nearly rounded, irregularly orbicular-rectan- gular in Sc. saxicola): the marginal cells of Sc. carinthiacd are also elongate in partial rows.</page><page sequence="192">448 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Scapania (Scapaniella) saxicola sp. n.

The present species, however, appears to occur more commonly over sandstone (rarely igneous rocks), all of which are characterized by the presence of at least traces of basic ions (measured pH, 7.3). The generally associated species at Taylors Falls and at Knife R., are Scapania mucronata (from which it differs at a glance by the gemmae-color), Tritomaria species (exsectiformis on Sand I. and at Taylors Falls), quinquedentata at the Knife R., Lepidozia reptans and Plagiochila as- plenioides (Taylors Falls), Lophozia barbata and heterocolpa (Knife R.), Lejeunea cavi- folia (Knife R.), Chiloscyphus pallescens (Taylors Falls), 7amesoniella autumnalis, Preis- sia quadrata, Scapania curta, and Solenostoma sphaerocarpum (Sand I.) and Solenostoma hyalinum (Sand I., Taylors Falls). All of these species are frequent under subcalcareous conditions (except the LepidoZid and Jamesoniella). The species has been observed repeat- edly at Taylors Falls and on Sand I. At both stations it occurs on relatively shaded to scarcely exposed moist, shaded sandstone rock-walls; the single station from St. Louis Co., Minn. (Conklin) also appears to be from a similar environment, and from a slightly calcareous site, as can be judged by the weak "calciphytes" associated with it. The species appears definitely to belong to the same complex as Sc. glaucocephala, as can be judged from the following similarities to that species: the nearly isodiametric mar. ginal leaf-cells; the tendency for the marginal cells to become thick-walled; the reddish. brown, 2-celled gemmae; the tendency for gemmiparous leaf-lobes to become subequal and attenuate, with the lobular cells enlarging perceptibly compared with normal leaf-cells. It appears to differ from all material I have seen of S. glaucocephala by the following mor- phological characters: 1. The plants become (under exposed conditions) more decumbent, and never pro- ducing the extremely flagelliform gemmiparous shoots of glaucocephala. 2. The leaf-keel of large, non-gemmiparous shoots elongate, 0.6-0.65 as long as ventral half of leaf (vs. 0.4-0.5 in similar mature shoots of Sc. glaucocephala). 3. Gemmae considerably larger, ranging from 10-13 x 16-23 ,u when mature and 2-celled (in Sc. glaucocephala described, by Frye and Clark, as "about 8 by 10 ,," but according to my observations becoming large in shade-material, up to 9-12 x 12-16 AL). 4. Leaf-margins, of mature robust shoots become distantly dentate or serrate, with the teeth (associated with gemmiparous leaves) often spinose and 2-3 cells long (in Sc. glaucocephata described as "entire," and entire in all mature gemmiparous or non-gem- * In leptodermous material (Taylors Falls, Minn.) the stalk-cells are narrow and elon- gate; in meso-vel pachydermous plants (Sand I.j Wisc.) they become smaller, more ovoid or subcircular; correlated with decrease in length of the stalk cells in pachydermous plants, there is also a decrease in length, e.g., in tapering of the lobes, and decrease in length of the lobe-cells of the gemmiparous region,</page><page sequence="194">450 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) . ,f?, ;, 7&lt;2. 3. 5. 7~~~7 I0. 9.

The species is of very considerable interest in that it proves to be another link con- necting up Scapaniella Buch and Scapania Dumort. (s. str.), corroborating the conserva- tive treatments (Joergensen, 1934, Schuster, 1949) in which the former is considered merely a subgenus of the latter. It should be pointed out that the xylicolous occurrence, and the elongate marginal leaf-cells (larger than those immediately within) cited as two important generic characters for Scapaniella do not occur in this species. Yet, as is evident from the description and figures, the clearest allies of this species are to be found in Sc. glaucocephala and vexata. The few collections available belong to two very different appearing types which will be discussed at length individually. (1) The plants from Sand I., and from the Knife R., are a larger form (up to 1.8 mm wide on the largest plants), more decumbent in growth, and show the marginal border of the leaves along the entire leaf-border; these plants also show frequent teeth of the leaf-margin (which may be quite serrate-dentate). Such plants are to be confused moSt easily with Sc. curta (which grows with them on Sand I.), !since the plants are nearly similar in size, and show the same development of a marginal border of thick- walled cells. The reddish-brown gemmae color will immediately separate Sc. saxicola from curta as well as the many more oil-bodies (6-12 per cell usually, vs. 2-5 for curta) .* The present species could be separated at once from the associated Sc. curta plants on the following basis: The plants of S. saxicola are pure-green throughout (including the postical leaf bases and stems), except for the gemmae. The typical curta plants are a lighter green, more yellowish or whitish-green, less chlorophyllose in appearance; furthermore, the postical leaf-bases are more or less vineous-red pigmented, and the stems are reddish or brownish- red; gemmae, when present, are pale-green.j It is apparent, therefore, that saxicola, which abundantly bore conspicuous, contrasting reddish-brown gemmae-masses, is unable to produce (under the mesic conditions in which it occurred) any trace of pigmentation, except of gemmae. True curta appears to react in an inverse manner: the leaf-bases and stems are able to produce reddish pigmentation, while the gemmae remain greenish. (Buch, 1928, also describes the gemmae as greenish or colorless for curta.) The robust plants treated above have also been confused with Sc. umbrosa, by Conklin (1942; the sole report for Sc. umbrosa in that paper is therefore transferrable to Sc. saxi- cola; Conklin's material was also listed under the "Examinations" by Frye and Clark, who also confused it with Sc. umbrosa). The Conklin material (cited above) is sparse, with reddish-brown gemmae that are 2- celled (as in Sc. umbrosa). The plants differ immediately from Sc. umbrosa, however, * There are also other differences which make it possible to separate the plants at a glance, when growing intermingled. Sc. saxicola has the basal portions of the leaves (especially the keel) more ascending than Sc. curta; the cells of Sc. curta are more hya- line, the dry plants as well as living moist ones (when not secondarily pigmented) having a pale whitish-green color (in Sc. saxicola the plants are a more distinct pure green, even after being dead for some time and moistened again, and the cells are much less transll- cent). The leaf is more strongly concave in Sc. saxicola, including the ventral half of the leaf, and the leaves (in plants growing with Sc. curta) are more imbricate than in Sc. curta. The ventral lobes are somewhat more pointed, usually apiculate in Sc. saxicola; in Sc. curta the ventral lobes are generally more broadly rounded, with a slight or no apiculum. Finally, under the existing environmental conditions at Sand I., where Sc. CUr.td and the type of Sc. saxicola grow together, we find that Sc. curtd abundantly devel- ops perianths, but rarely the greenish gemmae, while Sc. sdxicola develops numerous gemmae, but no perianths (or androecia). In fact, at first the Sc. saxicola was believed to be the gemmiparous plants of Sc. curta-a conclusion that was proved unfounded by the oil-body characters, the gemmae-color, the keel of the leaves, etc. f The single associated plant of typical curta found with gemmae had them somewhat immature, but as far as it was possible to ascertain no trace of pigmentation developed.</page><page sequence="196">452 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 0~~~~ 4.

(2) The second type of plant I include under Sc. saxicola is represented by the smaller leptodermous plants from Taylors Falls, Minn. These plants, when very small, look more like a juvenile form of Lophozia longidens than a Scapania. A large number of plants were found as semi-juvenile plants, among Solenostoma hyalinum and Ch. pal- lescens. These were quite atypical jn many regards, and are referred here with some mis- givings. The plants were mostly 2-4 mm long, quite green, except for the upper leaves (some of which showed brownish cell-walls), and for the reddish-brown gemmae. The most remarkable feature was the virtual or total absence of a keel in most (even most robust) plants, with the leaves very like those of Lophozia longidens: showing the same horn- like leaf-lobes. The facies of the plants were exactly like those of a miniature L. longi- dens. From the latter the plants differ at once in: 1. The smooth, ovoid gemmae (angular in L. longidens). 2. The smoother, smaller oil-bodies (coarsely granular-papillose in L. longidens). 3. The marked tendency for the development of larger cells at the apices of the lobes, in proximity to the gemmae-initials. 4. The tendency for the leaves to be somewhat more unequally bilobed. The material represented apparently a much shaded modification, obviously in direct contrast with the better developed, more robust Solenostoma and Chitoscyphus. These plants raise a very interesting problem. Buch (1928) has attempted to derive the Sca- paniaceae from the Lophoziaceae, specifically from "Lophozia oder Sphenolobus ahnlichen Vorfahren mit 2-lappigen, rinnigen oder rinnig gefaltenen, auf der Stamventralseite nicht herablaufenden Blatter. . .." The present plants would definitely point more to the Lophozia-complex as the ancestral type. When one considers the age of the Scapaniaceae (Sc. ornithopodioides and nimbosa represent Tertiary species; yet these are among the most specialized species!), and their nearness to the Lophoziaceae, one is amazed at the actual age of the Lophoziaceae as a group. Buch further states that the Sections Curtae, Irriguae, and Compactae stand nearest to this ancestral type. I would place the Subgenus Scapaniella even lower. The lack of a distinct keel in those species (except for a slight one near the apex of the commisure), and the simple stem-morphology, together with the nearly constant occurrence in symbiosis with mycorrhiza, all strike a familiar note: they recur again very widely in the Lophoziaceae. The illustrations in Plate 41 are taken from this second type of plant; most of the measurements in the species description are also based on the larger, more mature indi- viduals of this collection. These plants differ from type 1, in that the leaf-margins do not develop marginal teeth, in the very slight development of trigones (figs. 8, 11), in the more attenuate form of the gemmiparous leaf-lobes (fig. 3), and in the very slight or virtually obsoletely indicated border of thickwalled marginal cells (figs. 9, 11). The stem- anatomy, cell-size, oil-body number and form, gemmae color, form and size, all are in agreement; therefore, it is felt that these plants, even though very minute, nearly erect in growth, and quite different in general habitus should be referred to Sc. saxicola. The writer tentatively suggests that the differences between these plants is environmental in nature, plants of type 2 having come from an extremely moist, shaded environment, therefore developing a mod. parvifolia-integrifolia-leptoderma. Although confusion with Lophozia longidens and Scapania curta is possible, the sepa- ration of the species from these offers no critical problems. These arise only in the separa- tion of the species from S. glaucocephala, with which it was at one time believed cospecific, both by the author and by Dr. H. Buch. I am in receipt of the following opinion by Dr. Buch (May 28, 1952): "Durch Untersuchung des etwas reichlicheren Materials von Scapania saxicola bin ich zur selben Ansicht gekommen wie Sie; die Art scheint in der Tat keine solche schmallappige und</page><page sequence="198">454 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) schmalblHttrige Keimko6rner entwickelnde Sprosse zu besitzen wie Sc. glaucocephala. Jedenfalls sah ich lange Blattserien mit gleichseitig dreieckigen Lappen, und die charac- teristiche Zahnelung der kraftigen Blatter scheint nicht mit der Keimk6rnerbildung zusam- menhangen." Dr. H. Buch, to whom I had submitted some of the material I here place in S. saxicola, originally wrote to me (in lit., June 23, 1950): "Scapania saxicola Schuster scheint mir nichts anders zu sein also eine Sc. glaucocephala, welche soeben begonnen hat Keimko6rner zu entwickeln und folglich noch nicht die charakteristischen schmalblattrigen Sprosse besitz." Dr. Buch also enclosed a small specimen of what he considered to be Sc. glaucocephala, from the sole European station reported (Fennoscandia orientalis: prov. Carelia onegensis, par. Uksjarvi: ad lign. putr. Populi tremulae, Aug. 25, 1942, leg. L. Fagerstr6m). This material is typical Sc. glaucocephala in all respects and shows: 1. small gemmae, broadly oval in shape (8.5 x 12 A, 9 x 11 ,u, 10 x 12,g, 10 x 13.5 .L, 12 x 14 ,u, 12.5 x 14 at); 2. Cells of the leaf-lobes essentially rectangulate, very regularly arranged, with concave trigones; 3. Ascending growth, with small-leaved gemmiparous shoots developing subequally-lobed leaves; 4. The largest-leaved shoots with keel exactly 0.5 the length of the ventral lobe; 5. Leaf-margins uniformly entire; 6. Ventral lobe apex of large-leaved shoots quite acute, often terminated by two single cells in a row, nearly flat; 7. Cuticle obviously, if not coarsely verrucose; 8. Oil-bodies small, of minute granules, 4-5-6 per cell (rather poorly preserved in the material; perhaps no longer typical; essentially the same as in S. saxicola, but apparently fewer per cell). For some time I believed that possibly S. saxicola could be interpreted as a modifica- tion of S. glaucocephala, induced by the anomalous, inorganic substrate. However, this is obviously impossible, for the following reason: two small collections of S. saxicola were found on decaying logs (Schuster 17552, 17552a) under conditions typical for S. glauco- cephala. This material occurred with such xylicoles as Lophozia ascendens, Tritomaria exsectiformis, Jamesoniella autumnalis, Nowellia, Anastrophyllum hellerianum, Ptilidium pulcherrimum. I have very carefully and painstakingly compared these plants, which were typically developed, though very sparsely present, with the material of S. glaucocephala cited above (which Buch considers to be that species, and with which determination I com- pletely concur). The following essential differences are apparent: 1. The gemmae are much larger, elliptical, averaging about twice as long as wide, with isolated measurements as follows: 8 x 20 ,u, 10 x 21 ja, 12 x 19 A, 14 x 22 La, 12 x 22 it. 2. The cells of the leaf-lobes much more irregularly arranged, often with slightly bulging trigones, the cells usually isodiametric and rounded. 3. Growth scarcely ascending, with small-leaved shoots never developed as a consequence of gemmae-formation (e.g., gemmae-formation not in- hibiting leaf-development). 4. Keel of large leaves at least 0.6 length of the ventral lobe; 5. Ventral lobe apex essentially rounded to obtuse, except that the contour is interrupted by a single cell, marking the lobe-apex; ventral lobe generally obviously concave, the lobe- apex often incurved. 6. Cuticle smooth, without any perceptible verrucae. The above collections agree in all respects with the saxicolous material, indicating there is little or no modification with change in substrate. These collections, in my esti- ;nation, also prove that S. saxicola cannot be a modification of S. glaucocephala, since they occurred under conditions typical for the latter. The species name S. glaucocephala notes one of the very distinctive features of the latter species, the tendency for the develop- ment of erect, small-leaved, pale shoots (on which the lobes are reduced and become equal in size, and consequently the keel beconies circa 2/3 the ventral lobe in length). In all of the material of S. saxicola, including the xylicolous occurrences reported above, no evi- dence whatsoever of inhibition of leaf-development was noted associated with gemmae- development. The very- regular, rectangular-rounded leaf-cells of S. glaucocephala are also shared with other members of its group, such as S. carinthiaca. Like the latter, and related species, S. glaucocephala also shows uniformly entire leaf-margins. In the very irregular, rounded leaf-cells, and in the frequent dentition of the leaf-margins, S. saxicola approaches such species as S. curta and S. buchii. Indeed, the species shows almost as many affinities to the Sectio Curtae as to the Subgenus Scapaniella.</page><page sequence="199">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 455 Subgenus BUCHIELLA Schuster SCAPANIA (BUCHIELLA) CUSPIDULIGERA (Nees) K. Muller P1. 39:6-11 This decidedly northern species occurs in the Arctic-alpine Region and slightly into the Subarctic-subalpine. In Minnesota, as well as in the rest of the Great Lakes Region, it is quite rare and scattered in distribution. The species is a calciphyte, occurring as a pioneer or soon after invasion by Gymnostomum and similar mosses that occur in moist, shaded and sheltered crevices and rock-walls. The species, in our area, is commonly asso- ciated with Sc. gymnostumophila, Preissia quadrata and Lophozia gilimani, occasionally Solenostoma pumillum, Blepharostoma, Sc. subalpina and Tritomaria scitula. The chief requirements are a somewhat calcareous mineral substrate, not too extreme insolation, and a fairly constant, moderately high supply of moisture. Muller (1944) reports it as occurring under a pH of 7.2; I have found it at a pH of 6.9. In our area it occurs on northward facing basalt rock-walls, a foot or two above the surface of streams (as at the Temperance River), or on northwest facing moist ledges, on thin, marly soil (as at Grand Marais), again in extreme proximity to water, or at or near the wave action zone. This is one of the very easy species of the genus to recognize, even with the hand lens. The species has a distinct facies (well shown in P1. 39:8), is very small in size, usually from 4-8 mm long, and a pale to pure green, with the older parts occasionally blackish except for the brownish gemmae. The most characteristic feature are the leaves: these are scarcely keeled, but more or less sheath the stem basally (P1. 39:7-9), with only the portions of the leaf beyond the keel (i.e., the lobes) distinctly spreading; on non- gemmiparous shoots or older leaves the leaf-lobes are very broadly rounded, and without a trace of a point (P1. 39:7, 9); the margins, furthermore, are bordered by 1-several rows of thicker-walled cells.* In the subequal size of the leaf-lobes, and the thick-walled border of cells, the species resembles Sc. subalpina. It differs from the latter at once in the absence of marginal teeth, the fact that the dorsal lobe is stiffly erect and stands away from the stem (P1. 39:8-9), and in the much smaller size (commonly only 1/4 - 1/3 the size). In the field I find it is more likely to be mistaken for Sc. gymnostomophila, with which it shares the pure green color and reddish-brown or brown color of the gemmae-masses. It is apt to be overlooked for the latter species when it occurs inter- mingled with it (as at the Temperance River). The spreading, erect dorsal lobe, sub- equal to the ventral in size, and the absence of a keel of the leaves adequately separate the two. The two species also agree in the unusually large oil-bodies (but those of cuspiduligera occur mostly 2-3 per cell). Because of the type of leaf, giving the species a most peculiar appearance for a mem- ber of the genus, the species is now placed in a separate subgenus.

The ecological distribution is entirely similar to that of Sc. glaucocephala, and the two species not infrequently occur in admixture (as at Pigeon Point). Both species occur solely on moist, shaded, decorticated logs in Coniferous Forests, usually associated with Blepharostoma, Lepidozia, Jamesoniella, Anastrophyllum bellerianum, CephaloZia sp., and Lophocolea heterophylla, occasionally Lophozia ascendens, incisa and porphyro- leuca.

The gemmae (unlike most other species of Scapania, and unlike Sc. glaucocephala) are all 1-celled (P1. 40:8). Because of the 1-celled gemmae the species is most likely to be confused with the similarly minute, but extremely rare, S. carinthidca.

Group CURTAE SCAPANIA CURTA (Mart.) Dumort. P1. 44:6-10 Widely distributed throughout the Coniferous Zone, north into the Tundra Region; rare or absent in the northern edge of the Transition Zone.* In Minnesota Sc. curta is rare (if it occurs at all); it occurs much less widely than the very closely related Sc. mucronata in the entire Lake Superior area. The species appears to have a more restricted occurrence than mucronata, occurring most frequently on moist soil, or over rocks or ledges, rarely in calcareous areas, only very rarely on decaying logs. When well-developed, the species can be separated from both of the other local members of the Section Curtae by the presence of a distinct border of nearly equally thick- walled marginal leaf-cells (P1. 44:8). The apices of the ventral lobes are also rounded or only subacute apically, entire to very sparingly denticulate (P1. 44:7-8, 10). The leaf- cells in this species are intermediate in size between those of mucronatd and buchii, over- lapping extremes of both: in the middle of the ventral lobe they average near 20 x 30 'u, while those of the margins are mostly 15-22 L (P1. 44:8). Unlike that of both mucro- nata and buchii, the perianth-mouth is merely denticulate with teeth 1-3 cells long (P1. 44:6, 9, 10). This species, and the next two agree with the preceding species of the genus in that the leaf is considerably narrower than in the remaining species of the genus (with Sc. umbrosa forming an exception): the ventral half of the leaf usually being nearly or quite 1.5-2 times as long as wide (P1. 44:7). All of these species also agree in that the ventral half of the leaf is not or slightly decurrent, and the dorsal lobe is not at all decurrent (P1. 44:7, 10). The narrow leaf-lobes (and the small size of the species, which ranges from 2-12 mm, occasionally 15 mm), give all of these species a facies different from the larger species which follow (Sections Irriguae, Undulatae, Nemorosae). The thick-walled border of marginal cells often is not well developed in this species, when occurring in very shaded or moist sites; such extreme forms, when lacking perianths, can be separated from mucronata only by means of the oil-bodies. The oil-bodies in curta are very small and occur only 2-4 per cell; they obscure only about 1/4 - 1/3 of the area of the cells. In mucronata and buchii the oil-bodies occur 3-6 or even 5-10 per cell in the leaf-lobes, and occur in all cells; they are larger and obscure /&gt;2 - 3/4 the area of the con- taining cells. In S. curta the pigmentation is (in part at least) vineous to red-brown or purplish; even in shade forms the ventral leaf-bases tend to be wine-red in color (and bordered * Since Sc. mucronata and Sc. buchi (= lingulata) were split off from the oldler curta, the distribution of curta has remained in doubt.</page><page sequence="204">460 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) by thick-walled cells).* In mucronata and buchii the plants become brownish (or even brownish-black) pigmented, with the postical leaf-bases and stems never purplish to reddish-brown. Distribution.-Reported from a large number of stations in Minnesota by Conklin in 1942; I have checked much of this material, and find that all of it belongs to S. mucro- nata. None of the material of the many collections of the Sectio Curtae I have made in Minnesota can be referred safely to S. curta. In nearby Wisconsin, strangely enough, S. curta appears to almost replace totally S. mucronata and buchii in some localities, most notoriously on Sand I., Apostle lsls., where S. curta is perhaps the most ubiquitous Sca. pania. The species occurs here limited to moist sandstone, both slightly acid and sub- calcareous (for instance, with Lophozia (Leiocolea) heterocolpa and Blepharostoma, in S 17530). Under more acid conditions it may occur with Scapania umbrosa, S. nemo- rosa, S. subalpina, S. saxicola, Jamesoniella, Pellia epipbylla, Solenostoma levieri and hyalinum, S. pumillum, and a wide range of similar, often epipetric species. The apparent lack of true S. curta in Minnesota becomes very baffling, when the extraordinary abun- dance of this species so close to the Minnesota boundary is considered. Further collecting will probably reveal its presence here, and possibly some of the Conklin collections listed as S. curta (that I have not seen) may actually represent that species. At present, the species cannot be included as occurring in the state. SCAPANIA MUCRONATA Buch PIs. 43 :9-13; 44:1-5 Very widely distributed in the northern edge of the Deciduous Zone and throughout the Coniferous Zone, north into the Tundra. In Minnesota occurring from the south- eastern corner of the state northward, occurring almost across the state in the northern part of the state west to Lake of the Woods. The species has an apparently very wide ecological distribution, being found under circumneutral or subcalcareous conditions as well as moderately acid conditions. Although generally associated with rocks and essen- tially an epipetric species, decaying logs near ledges or in rocky woods may be extensively colonized by the species. Sc. mucronata, in Minnesota at least, occurs most commonly on circumneutral sites, usually on thin soil over north or northwest facing cliffs or ledges, under typically mesic, occasionally mesic-xeric conditions. It is associated here on basaltic rocks, with such calciphytes as Tritomaria scitula, Sc. gymnostomophila, occasionally Odontoschisma macounii.t Under slightly more acid conditions it often is found with the Tritomaria quinquedentata, Lophozia (B.) barbata, Lophozia longidens and ventri- cosa, etc. The species is apparently absent from the very acid sites (Badzania-Lepidozia- Blepharostoma Associule), though it may be frequently found with Lophozia heterocolpa and Blepharostoma on thin soil over subcalcareous rocks, under slightly acid conditions. * Buch (1928) has stressed the fact that the species Sc. curta and parvifolia (e.g., the Subsectio Marginatae) differ in the pigmentation-pattern from the Subsectio Immar- ginatae (Sc. buchii, Sc. mucronata, etc.). The first subsection shows a pronounced ten- dency for the formation of reddish or vineous pigmentation (starting with the stem and postical leaf-bases; under exposed conditions spreading to other portions of the plant). The second subsection shows a tendency for the formation of brownish pigmentation (except in Sc. scandica). However, the material of Sc. curta collected by the writer on Sand I., Wisc. shows a pronounced tendency to form a golden brown pigmentation of the leaves-much as in Sc. mucronata and buchii. These plants sometimes show the purplish pigmentation of the postical leaf-bases, sometimes lack it altogether. The plants are also unusual in represent- ing a mod. colorata-pachyderma, in which the trigones are somewhat or slightly bulging. Buch has stressed that fact that the pachydermous modification, though frequent in the species of the Immarginatae, does not appear to be formed in Sc. curta. t Over sandstone, further southward, Sc. saxicola, Tr. exsectiformis, Lophozia excisa, and Lophocolea minor occur with it, under a measured pH of 7.0-7.3.</page><page sequence="205">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 461 OQ~~~~~~~ ~4. plant,~ ~~~ wtpei nth 3.8 6.

This is char- acterized chiefly by the absence, normally, of the apiculum (PI. 43:12) that normally occurs at the tip of the ventral lobes in the European forms. The species is very similar to Sc. curta and buchii. It differs from the former at once in the uniform nature of the leaf-cells (the marginal cells have trigones as large as the interior cells, and do not form a border) (P1. 43:9, 12), and in the longly lobed and ciliate-fimbriate perianth mouth (P1. 44:1-3). The leaf-cells are occasionally slightly smaller on an average than given for curta, but in local material seem to be fully equal to it. The separation from buchii is even more difficult: the latter has larger leaf-cells (19- 26 A along the margins, 20-26 jl in middle of ventral lobe), and has the leaf-margins with fine, scattered denticulations, while the ventral lobe is lingulate in shape (P1. 45:1-3). In mucronata there are 3-5 oil-bodies in most cells of the leaf-lobes; in buchii there are mostly 6-10 oil-bodies per cell. Fertile plants of mucronata have the leaves (and even the bracts) with the lobes quite entire; in buchii most robust, and especially fertile shoots, and particularly the female bracts develop scattered marginal teeth. Sc. mucronata also normally has the perianth-mouth with shallow, ciliate-dentate lobes, with the ciliae several cells wide at base; buchii has crowded, slender, cilia mostly 1 cell wide to the base.

Buch (ad litt., Sept. 3, 1949) states, in answer to a query on part of the author: "Scapania curta s. str. habe ich seinerzeit von Prof. Evans aus Nordamerika erhalten und zwar aus Maine, Wisconsin und New Hampshire." The report of this species in Evans (1936) therefore does not appear to have been based on material studied by Buch; since no exact locality is cited for S. curta from Minnesota in the 1936 paper by Evans, it is possible that this material may represent one of the collections of S. mucronata, previously listed as S. curta, cited above.</page><page sequence="207">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 463 SCAPANIA BUCHII K. Miiller* (= lingulata Buch) P1. 45 Buch (1928) lists this species as probably holarctic in distribution, and as widespread in Northern Europe, and lists it from Maine and Greenland. It is also recorded from Brakley Point, Canada by Frye and Clark (1946). Critical study of the Group Curtae will probably result in its discovery throughout much of the northern portion of North America, with a restricted distribution in the southern half of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone. In Minnesota it is known only from the few localities listed below, but probably of isolated occurrence in much of the northeastern third of the state.j The species appears to have much the same ecological requirements as mucronata: i.e. it occurs on moist to moderately dry cliffs and ledges and in their crevices, more rarely on soil.T Unlike mucronata, the species is apparently not found on decaying logs or otherwise associated with purely organic substrata. Unlike mucronata it also occurs very usually in a sterile state, and differs from the latter also in that it often occurs (in Amer- ica) as a mesodermous-pachydermous modification with yellowish, bulging trigones. Such plants are deep brownish to blackish, under the hand lens. In the field, and even under the binocular microscope, this species is sometimes virtual- ly impossible to tell from the closely related mucronata and curta. The usually brownish or blackish-brown color separates pigmented material from that of curta, even in the field. Under the microscope the collenchymatous nature of the marginal cells (with no indication usually of a border of thick-walled cells) is also a good separating character from curta (compare Pls. 45:5, 8 and 44:8), as well as the slightly larger cells (mostly 20-27 it on margins, and averaging 25-27 ,u in leaf-middle, with occasional cells. to 36 g). The fimbriate-perianth mouth, which has closely approximated cilia, also separates the species from curta. In all of these characters (except cell-size) the species approaches mucronata. It differs from mucronata in the much larger cells (those of mucronata are only 14-20 A along the margins and no more than 18 x 24 in the leaf-middle), as well as in the tendency to have a few scattered marginal, 1-celled teeth (absent, however, in much American material) (P1. 45:1-3, 8-9). The gemmae of buchii are up to 35 A long, but most of them are appreciably smaller -(P1. 45:10); in both curta and mucronata the gem- mae are never more than 24-27 ,u long. Of more importance, the oil-bodies in buchii occur 6-12 per cell in the marginal cells (P1. 45:7-8) and in 9-20 per cell in the leaf- middle and leaf-base (and nearly obscure the cell-lumen); in both mucronata and curta there are generally less than 6 oil-bodies per cell in the marginal cells and those of the apical part of the leaf, and at most 6-12 per cell in the leaf-base. The oil-body character, * Miiller (1944, 256, 272) has proposed the name S. buchii for S. lingulata Buch, since there is an earlier S. ligulata St., on the basis that S. ligulata and lingulata are orthographic variants of the same name, hence the later name of Buch's is a homonym. Miiller (1944, 272) however, points out that Warnstorf (Hedwigia 63: 75, 1921) described a S. microphylla from Greenland (leg. Vahl), which is identical with S. lingu- lata Buch. Buch has also arrived at this conclusion. Therefore, it is evident that, should S. lingulata Buch have to be dropped as a later homonym, the correct name for this species will have to be S. microphylla Wstf. (1921), rather than S. buchii K. Miiller (1944). Since this conclusion was arrived at subsequently to the completion of the present paper, S. buchii is used here purely because the needed changes in citation through- out the work can no longer be.made. t I have also collected it on nearby Isle Royale, Michigan. : On cliffs and in crevices it occurs most often with Tritomaria exsectiformis, (more rarely T. quinquedentata), Lophozia excisa, bicrenata and silvicola, Cephaloloziella rubel. la and byssacea, and such oxylophytic mosses as Polytrichum,</page><page sequence="208">464 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) I.~~~~~~4 /&lt; 6 / 6. 3. 00~~~~~~~~~~ 8. 10.

The plants show acute, obtuse, or even rounded dorsal lobes and uni- formly rounded ventral lobes; the latter often bear 2-8 small, 1-celled teeth formed by isosceles-triangular cells. The marginal cells are ca. 17-19 to 22 jA and agree with those of S. curta in that they are evenly thick-walled, usually largely dead and hyaline, devoid of oil-bodies. The plants are an unusually dense-leaved modification, and have rather strongly concave ventral lobes, so concave that they cannot easily be flattened out under the cover-slip under pressure, without tearing. The cells are further characterized by the largely spherical, moderately small (mostly 5-6.5 ,u) oil-bodies, which occur in most of the cells of the free lobes, except marginally, and usually are found 6-9 per cell. In the leaf-middle they become more abundant, correlated with larger cell-size, and are found 8-11 per cell. The gemmae are present, greenish, thin-walled and largely 2-celled at matur- ity; they are mostly ovoid to weakly pyriform and are up to 32 A long at maturity. In the rounded leaf-lobes, the rather broad ventral halves of the leaf (65-80% as wide as long), the distinctly thick walled marginal cells, and the relatively small size of the oil bodies, the plants agree with material of S. curta seen (New York, Wisconsin, Maine, Europe). However, Buch describes S. curta as with only 2-4 oil-bodies per cell in the leaf-lobes, an observation I can substantiate fully on the basis of study of the Wis- consin and New York material. The material has the oil-body characteristics of S. buchii, but the oil-bodies are smaller; furthermore, the leaves are margined by thick-walled cells; finally, the marginal cells rarely exceed 19 ,u in size. The plants, therefore, can be placed at best as atypical material of S. buchii. Though possibly representing a new species, the sole collection (found amidst Lophozia excisa, on a dry bank over basaltic rocks) does not make possible a fuller study of the plant. Should the above oil-body features prove correlated with differential features of the perianth, the material may prove to be a species distinct from S. buchii. For the present, it seems wisest to call the attention of students to this type, without attempting to separate it from the obviously very close S. buchii.t The plants probably represent an xeric extreme of the rather widespread but rare S. buchii, because of the shape of the ventral leaf-lobe (distinctly lingulate), the occasional marginal teeth of ventral (and more rarely dorsal) lobe, the many oil-bodies per cell; the often rather large marginal cells (on some leaves averaging 20-22 A along the free mar- gin of the lobes); the pigmentation pattern (lobes becoming brownish, but postical leaf- bases remaining hyaline, without trace of purplish secondary wall pigments); the large gemmae (to 32 A long). As such, they show certain anomalous features, among them: 1. Strongly concave ventral lobes, with the margin of the free lobes so strongly dorsally reflexed that it cannot be fully flattened, even under pressure, after the leaf is spread out. In very abundant, extremely typical material of S. buchii (collected by the writer at the Great Palisade Bluff, Lake Co., Minnesota), the slightly concave nature of * Although Buch stresses the mucronate ventral lobes of mucronata as one of the characters separating it from buchii (which has the lobes lingulate and rounded at the apex (P1. 45:1-3, 9), terminated at most by a 1-celled obtuse tooth), this character is of little value for the identification of American material, since all American material of mucronata that I have seen has the ventral leaf-lobes obtuse or scarcely pointed apically, with usually a terminal tooth formed by a single obtusely angulate cell. It is quite possi- ble our American material classed as mucronata may represent a closely related but discrete taxon. t The plants appear to show differences in pigmentation-pattern from S. curta. They show hyaline postical leaf-bases (where the cells are oil-body free, thick-walled almost uniformly in 3-5 cell-rows), never with vineous pigmentation; the cells of the rest of the leaf show a yellowish to yellowish-brown pigmentation. S. curta, s. str., also never develops a pachydermous modification; the present plants are somewhat pachydermous, with dis- tinctly, if not excessively, bulging trigones (except for the marginal 1-2 rows, which are hyaline, dead, and equally thick-walled),</page><page sequence="210">466 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) the ventral lobes that appears so characteristic of the species is evident, with the free margins of the lobes perceptibly, if not strongly dorsally reflexed. The present plants, correlated with the extremely dry habitat, appear to be merely an xeric extreme of this more normal type. 2. The leaf-lobes of plants with bulging trigones show slightly to distinctly evenly thick-walled marginal cells, in at least one row; these, as well as often several adjacent rows of cells are hyaline, dead, and lack oil-bodies. Buch (1928) emphasizes the absence of oil-bodies from some of the marginal cells, and the thick-walled nature of these cells, as one of the differentiating features that separate the Subsectio Marginatae (S. curta, etc.) from the Subsectio Immarginatae (S. buchii, mucronata, etc.). As is evident, the present xeromorphic plants show that at least S. buchii of the Immarginatae may under- go a pattern of modification, with conditions of insolation and intermittent moisture, that closely follows that undergone by S. curta under very evidently less extremely xeric environmental conditions. This evident tendency of S. buchii to follow in the footsteps, sc to speak, of S. curta (but under more extreme conditions), makes a separation into Marginatae and Immarginatae of much less value than would appear from the work of Buch. Buch (1928) already emphasized that the leptodermous extremes of the two species could scarcely be separated. It would now appear that the xeric extreme of S. buchii at times is also inseparable from S. curta, except on the following bases, which are admit- tedly tenuous, when only dead material devoid of oil-bodies is available: a. The larger marginal leaf-cells (often 20-22 A on margins of free lobes); b. The larger gemmae; often 32-35 , maximum length; c. The lack, in all cases, of violet to purplish pigmentation of the postical leaf-bases, even when the rest of the plant is pigmented. d. The lack of development of a border of thick-walled marginal cells until the in- terior leaf cells have become strongly collenchymatous. (As is well known, S. curta will not develop bulging trigones under even extreme conditions: the plants then strongly reddish to purplish-brown pigmented, and 2-4 rows of marginal cells evenly thick-walled, but inner cells still with concave trigones.) e. The mostly 6-9 oil-bodies per cell in the free-lobes (in S. curtd with only 2-4 oil- bodies per cell in the free lobes; these perceptibly smaller in most cases).

The species is a distinct mesophyte, occurring only rarely on dry and strongly insolated decaying logs. The habitat is usually nearly sufficient to identify this species: it is larger in size (0.8-1.5, occasionally 2.0 cm long, 2-2.5 mm wide) than our other Scapania species occurring oni logs. Furthermore, it has distinctly serrate leaf- margins (P1. 51:1-2). The leaves are also quite different in form: the lobes being ovate-pointed, with the dorsal lobe directed forward (and at only a 10- 350 angle with the stem-apex), niot outward (PI. 51:1-2). Confusion is most likely with small xylicolous forms of Sc. nemorosa, but the gemmae (unlike in the latter) are 2-celled, although they have a similar reddish pigmentation, and the marginal teeth are in the form of serrations, and do not project out- ward at right angles from the leaf-margin (P1. 51:2): in nemorosa the spi- nous-denticulate margins bear teeth that are at right angles with the margin (P1.51:13-14). This species bridges the gap between the preceding groups with narrow leaf-lobes (which it shares with them), and those of the following groups with decurrent ventral lobes (which it shares with them). The species also has a characteristic whitish-green color (rarely slightly brownish-tinged in direct sunlight), and a suberect growth (with the shoot-apex usually quite recurved) . Distribution.* - LAKE: Reported from the Knife River, St. Louis Co., C 347, C 825, C 827 (Conklin, 1942), and from the "Kimbe River" (Frye &amp; Clark, 1946). Group IRRIGUAE SCAPANIA IRRIGUA (Nees) Dumort. P1. 46:1-8 This is one of our commonest species of Scapania, and occurs throughout the Conifer- ous Region; elsewhere it is found in the northern edge of the Deciduous Forest Region, as well as northward into the Tundra. In Minnesota the species occurs commonly in the Lake Superior region, along or near the shore and in the ravines of the streams that drain into it; more occasionally the species occurs in the swamps and bogs in the interior of the state. S. irrigua, as the name implies, is generally found near water: either associated with sunny rock-pools (there with the Scapanid hyperbored-degenii complex, Plagiochila, Odon- toschisma macounii, and Lophozia gillmani), or in wet, springy depressions in Thuyd swamps (there with Riccardi pinguis and multifida, Scapania paludicola, Moerkia hiber- nlica, Marchantia, etc.); occasionally the species occurs in the open parts of peat-bogs that are underlain by marl (there occurring with S. paludicola, Mylia, etc.). * I have had opportunity to study two of the Conklin specimens. Both specimens seen agree in the 2-celled, reddish-brown gemmae, and thick-walled marginal leaf-cells (form- ing a border discrete from the thin-walled interior cells). The specimens are undoubtedly referable to S. saxicola Schuster, possessing bordered leaves, widely spreading ventral and dorsal lobes (never suberect as in umbrosa), and show quite undecurrent ventral leaf- bases. The only reliable report left for S. umbrosa, from the Lake Superior region, is the one from Sand I., Wisconsin (Schuster). The Frye and Clark report from "Kimbe River" is based on one of the Conklin speci- mens from the Knife River; it undoubtedly is an error in transcription. It is apparent, therefore, that Frye and Clark, as well as Conklin, have misunderstood these specimens.</page><page sequence="212">468 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) I.. 6. 6 Tw 1 &lt; lz tt5X 3. 1 4 .~~~~3 .3.

Although it occurs occasionally with Riccardia pinguis and multifida, and Moerkia flotowiana, it usually is found under less calcareous conditions than the Riccardias and Moerkia, and is more frequent under less shaded conditions than these species "prefer." The species is occasional in bogs, but I have found it more often in lotic environments. This species normally presents little difficulty in determination. Shade forms of palui- dicola, in which the leaf-keel is weakly arched, and the dorsal lobe obliquely pointing outward, may be mistaken for it; some leaves, at least, on such shade forms present the typical paludicola form, normally. Since the leaves never have the keel strongly arched in the present species, material with partly arched keels is apparently referable to paludi- cola. On the other hand, confusion may occur with S. mucronata. The latter is usually much smaller (mostly under 12 mm long), and has the ventral leaf-lobes narrow (rarely over 0.7 times as wide as long); in the present species the ventral lobes are mostly 0.9- 1.2 as wide as long, though immature leaves and leaves of shaded shoots may revert to the more generalized condition exemplified by mucronata. The presence of distinct points, on at least some of the lobes, and the scarcely decurrent ventral leaf-bases separate the species from undulata (which never occurs in bogs, and is essentially riparian). The differentiation of the present species from paludicola is sometimes very difficult, and occasionally impossible. In material from a bog 8 miles southwest of Gheen, of which a great deal was collected (because of the obvious intergradation), material that was typi- cal irrigua, with a weakly arched keel predominated. However, some plants with a strongly arched keel, and a cordate dorsal lobe (whose point was directed at an angle of 10-25? with the stem apex), occurred intermingled. These had the green 2-celled gemmae of irrigua, though otherwise typical paludicola. According to Buch (1928) paludicola may have relatively weakly arched keels, when growing under moist and shaded conditions (as was the case in much of the present material), but the brownish color of the gemmae (due to secondary pigmentation) appears even in such weakly illuminated forms. If this is always the case, the disposition of forms with paludicola-like leaves becomes very difficult. The writer, from his observations with the hyperborea-degenii complex, believes that all of the members of the irrigua complex, under conditions of extreme insolation and transpiration, show a tendency to produce, on robust shoots, leaves with strongly arched keels. This tendency evinces itself earlier (i.e., with a slighter stimulus) in paludicola and degenii, than in hyperborea, and irrigua. However, the tendency exists in all these species to some degree. Therefore, the nature of the arch of the keel must be used as a specific character with the utmost caution. Furthermore, in paludicola the ventral lobe is usually subcircular and as wide or wider than long. In the local material, appearing inter- mediate, there is all intergradation between the obovate or ovate irrigua type of ventral lobe and the subcircular, broad paludicala type. The occurrence of typical irrigua and typical paludicola in the same collection and limited area, suggests that some of the intermediate-appearing plants may be the result of hybridization.

Muller P1. 46:9-14 Distributed, rather sparingly, throughout the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, with (further east) a slight extension into the Deciduous Zone, and a wider distribution in the Tundra</page><page sequence="214">470 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Regions. In Minnesota confined, as far as known, to bogs in the northeastern third of the state. It occurs largely in bogs in calcareous regions, and seems to be confined to wet open places in bogs, or to the margins of streams draining them, or to the bordering Spruce-Cedar Forests, where there are apparently traces of lime in the substrate. The species is a hygrophyte or meso-hygrophyte, and usually grows in fairly exposed to moder- ately shaded localities. In the bog-mat, it is associated with Sphagnum and Mylia anom- ala, Cephalozia species, Lophozia marchicd, etc. Along brooks draining bogs (as at Gheen), it may occur on wet subcalcareous soil, associated with Scapania irrigua, Pellia epiphylla and Marchantia. The chief requirements appear to be an abundant water supply and traces of Ca in the substrate or underlying soil. This species is normally very easy to recognize. It is the only one of our species in which the dorsal lobes are heart-shaped and cordate, with the point directed towards the stem apex. The strongly arched leaf-keel (with the leaf thus appearing divided nearly to base) is very characteristic, but in weakly developed shade forms (leptodermous modifica- tions) may not be well developed. Such shade forms are deceptively similar to the closely related S. irrigua, which, however, never produces heart-shaped dorsal lobes, nor strongly arched keels. The difficulty is increased when the two species occur together, as in St. Louis County. Since this is very often the case (the ecological requirements of the two species being very similar), they frequently grow intermingled, as in St. Louis County. Under such conditions, some intergradation appears to occur, perhaps due to hybridization. If this should not be the case, paludicola may have to be considered a vicarious form of irrigUd. S. paludicola is superficially almost indistinguishable from S. paludosa (a species found in Michigan, but not yet in Minnesota). S. paludosa, however, has the ventral lobes almost circular and rounded at the apex, and both dorsal and ventral lobes are dis- tinctly decurrent on the stem (to a point far below the insertion of the keel).

It was described from the Alps, and more lately has been found in one station each in England and in Finland and two in Sweden. It has not previously been reported from North America, except for the reports (see Schuster, 1950) from the Belcher Islands, in Hudson Bay, and from Cape Jones and Richmond Gulf (along the east coast of Hudson Bay, in northern Quebec).* The occurrence of the species in Minnesota is extremely remarkable and represents an important extension in range. In Minnesota I know it only from the Tem- perance River ravine, where it occurs on moist, basic rocks, together with Tritomaria quinquedentata and Plagiochila asplenioides. The species, judging from the few reports, always occurs on moist rocks associated either with rock-pools or running water. It is either a pioneer species here, or invades soon after ecesis of pioneer sp2cies, after the development of a very thin soil layer. The species grows most often in direct sun, and is generally brownish pigmented, with the stems deep brown to blackish. Scapania degenii is relatively large, and 2.5-3.5 nmm wide. It is likely to be confused with three other species of the genus: S. paludicola, S. hyperborea, and S. nemorosa. The material usually bears masses of red-brown gemmae at the apex of the shoots: much as in these three species (P1. 49:3). These gemmae are 1-celled and thick-walled, as in Sc. nemorosa. (I have studied several thousand gemmae from the local collection: all were one-celled, except for a solitary gemma that was divided by a transverse wall and thus 2-celled.) In the 1-celled gemmae S. degenii differs at once from paludicola and * Also reported, since this was written, from northern Quebec (Arnell, 1950).</page><page sequence="215">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 471 2. 3. 000 4 0Q00pd0 o 5. -6 PLATE 47.

S. paludicola, however, has more acutely pointed dorsal lobes that are directed towards the stem-apex (in both hyperborea and degenii the dorsal lobes are broadly reniform, strongly convex, and lack distinct points: the obscure points, when present, also are at a broad angle with the stem-apex). Confusion is especially apt to occur with Sc. hyperborea, and the writer is not yet convinced that degenii is distinct at all times from hyperborea.* Distribution.-COOK: Temperance R. gorge, S 14698. Scapania degenii var. dubia var. novat Pls. 47; 48 This critical form has a pronounced restriction to the Arctic shore-line strip, extending northward from the Temperance R. and Grand Marais (The Point), to the Susie Islands. It is limited, at least locally, to situations within 1-18 feet of the water level, where it grows chiefly at the elges of pools, on sunny rocks, forming the matrix for tussocks of Scirpus caespitosus and for the small, rare Selaginella selaginoides and Tofieldia glutinosa, Hepaticae such as Lophozia (Leiocolea) muelleri, L. gillmani, Odontoschisma macounii, Ptilidium ciliare, Tritomaria quinquedentata, and Scapania irrigua, as well as the charac- teristic vascular plants, Primulla mistassinica and intercedens, Pinguicula vulgaris and Potentilla fruticosa. As can be seen from a perusal of the list of associated species, the Scapania here occurs as a sub-calciphyte. The substrate varied in pH from 5.3 to 7.0. In the sub-calciphilous occurrence, the species recalls the extremely closely related Sc. irrigua (note the occurrence of irrigua a little further southward, below the Temperance River, and at the Gooseberry River, among the tussocks of Scirpus, under identical condi- tions, also associated with Primulla, Pinguicula, and Potentilla fruticosa). Sc. irrigua, however, is much more frequent in occurrence in bogs, where it is often an abundant species. In the two-celled gemmae, size, the usually weakly or moderately arched keel of the leaves, degree of decurrence of the leaf-bases, this form is very similar to S. irrigua. However, it differs at once from S. irrigua in the reddish-brown color of the gemmae, the strongly brownish color of the cell-walls of plants from exposed sites, the strong tendency for the dorsal and ventral lobes to be obtuse-rounded (with the dorsal lobes usually so strongly dorsally convex that the obtuse apex is quite obscured, the dorsal lobe appearing to be typically reniform). The brownish, or even blackish-brown color of the plants is characteristic, and only shaded hygric extremes show a green color. Even the green lepto- dermous forms from unusually shaded sites show the reddish-brown color of the gemmae, and relatively large trigones (so need not be mistaken for S. irrigua).T * The single local collections, of female plants, agreed closely with typical S. degenii in (1) the 1-celled reddish-brown gemmae; (2) the subentire mouth of the perianth; (3) the leaf-form and somewhat arched keels of the leaves. However, the dorsal lobes of the leaves, in general, are somewhat smaller than in the type material of S. degenii (never 3/4 - 4/5 the ventral lobes in size, as is often the case with the upper leaves of S. de- genii). In that respect, the plants approach S. degenii var. dubia, described subsequently. The remote possibility exists that female plants always have 1-celled gemmae, while male plants may be heterothallic in producing partly 2-celled gemmae. If such could be demonstrated, S. degenii var. dubia would be the male plant of S. degenii, and not deserve taxonomic recognition. However, no such heterothalism has been proved in any other species of the genus. t Similis S. degenii, sed gemmis frequenter bicelltilaribus; lobus superior ca. 0.5 lobi inferioris. j The two species occur together frequently, as on Sailboat I., Susie Isls., and at Grand Marais. When living plants, growing intermingled, are studied, the S. degenii dubia at once stands out in the very large oil-bodies, the S. irrigua showving in contrast much smaller oil-bodies.</page><page sequence="220">476 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) In the reddish-brown color, the reddish-brown, predominantly 2-celled gemmae, the non-decurrent leaf-bases, the relatively small size of the dorsal lobe (ca. 1/3 - 1/2 the ventral lobe in size), this taxon is very similar to S. hyperborea, an Arctic-alpine species, reported by Jensen (1910) from Greenland, while Evans (1921) reports it from "on rocks above timberline" on Mt. Katahdin, Maine and Mt. Lafayette, New Hampshire. Lepage (1945) reports S. hyperborea from Mt. Albert, Quebec (on the basis of deter- minations made by Evans). I have studied the Quebec specimens; they definitely do not represent S. hyperborea. S. hyperborea, therefore, is found only above timberline, or in the Arctic, thus is an Arctic-alpine species.* At first the collections here reported as S. degenii dubia were believed to represent S. hyperbored. On the basis of the reddish-brown, 2-celled gemmae they key to this in the classic work on the genus by Buch (1928).1 However, more protracted and critical study, especially comparison with S. hyperborea from northern Europe (leg. H. Buch), Mt. Katahdin, Maine and Mt. Lafayette, N. H. (leg. Evans), has convinced the writer that these specimens, though approaching S. hyper- borea (and diverging from S. degenii) in two characteristics: (1) partly or largely 2-celled gemmae, (2) a dorsal lobe averaging only one-half the ventral in size, still are not iden- tical with S. hyperborea.T The differences from S. hyperborea lie largely in the more strongly curved keel of the leaves (of all but the mod. viridis, which has a straight keel also in degenii and degenii dubia); the usually more narrowly elliptical gemmae, which rarely are preponderantly 2- celled; the much more robust size; and in the very different form of the leaves (of the more xeromorphic forms). However, it must be admitted that the mod. viridis, from shaded sites,, develops a nearly straight keel of the leaves, and a leaf-form closely approaching that of S. hyperborea (see P1. 47:6). It is readily evident, from the divergent opinions expressed regarding these plants by the two most eminent European authorities, that' the S. degenii-hyperborea-paludicola- irrigua complex remains critical. We probably will find that these four species will show divergent genotypes occurring at the periphery of their respective ranges. The type of S. * In Europe it is strictly Arctic, not occurring in the Alpine regions of Central Europe. 1 Furthermore, the eminent authority, Dr. K. Miiller, wrote (Dec. 22, 1948) that "Nos. 7005a, 7000b, 11966, 11965, 11955 geh6ren, wie Sie schon feststellten, zu Sca- pania hyperborea." In 1952, Dr. Muller, at the author's request, again checked these specimens, and still maintained that they represent S. hyperborea. In the meantime, the writer had figured this material (Schuster 1950, Plate 7), and discussed it as S. hyper- borea, t The writer was convinced of this by Dr. H. Buch, to whom material was submitted in 1947, and who wrote (November 8, 1947) as follows: "Besonders interessant sind Ihre als Scapania hyperborea bezeichneten Proben (Nos. 7005a, und b, 11965, 11960, 11969, 11970, 11982, und 12008). Sc. hyperborea liegt nicht vor, h6chst wahrscheinlich aber Sc. Degenii Schffn., von welcher ich Ihnen einst ein Probchen sandte. Ein naherer Vergleich zeigte gute Obereinstimmung sowohl betreffs der Blattform also der Keim- k6rner. Die letzten sind ganz iiberwiegend einzellig und schmal elliptisch. Sc. hyperborea hat meistens breit elliptische, 2-zellige Keimk6rner . . . ist schmachtigeren Wuchses und hat anders gef6rmte Blatter." The writer has carefully compared the material here called S. degenii dubia with the type material of S. degenii (from the Alps) as well as with illustrations of it (Schiffner, 1932; K. Mliller, 1944). He finds that he must agree with Miiller in that the Minnesota plants truly differ from typical S. degenii in at least two respects (1) the occurrence of at least some 2-celled gemmae; (2) the much smaller size of the dorsal lobe. In typical degenii the dorsal lobe of the upper leaves may be fully 4/5 the ventral in size, while on median leaves it is usually slightly over one-half to 2/3 the ventral in size. Such large dorsal lobes do not appear to occur in the material from Sweden (leg. Thedenius, 1842; several plants studied through the courtesy of Dr. H. Buch), nor in the Minnesota plants. For that reason, I believe it wise to distinguish these plants as a discrete variety, the var. dubia.</page><page sequence="221">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 477 degenii, from the Alps represents such a disjunct and peripheral occurrence of a species of rare and sporadic distribution.

Group UNDULATAE SCAPANIA UNDULATA (L.) Dumort. P1. 51:6-10 Widely distributed in the Coniferous and Tundra Zones, extending southward slightly into the northern edge of the Deciduous Zone. In Minnesota restricted in occurrence to the region fringing Lake Superior. The species is infrequent in Minnesota, and is often overlooked for the very similar appearing and commoner Sc. nemorosa. Sc. undulata is restricted in occurrence to rocky places in the vicinity of water. The species is often a pioneer, undergoing ecesis on the vertical walls of rocky islands, at the edge of the wave-action zone, where virtually no other Bryophytes develop (as on Porcu- pine Island and Big Susie I.); here it may form large, grass-green mats with purplish- brown stems. Often associated on such sites is S. nemorosa or S. subalpina (or both). S. nemorosa usually stands out by its more or less obvious, often deep purplish pigmenta- tion, strongly contrasted to the nearly pure green color of the S. undulatd (and the gener. ally whitish-green color of the S. subalpina). S. undulata may also form large, spongy masses along the crevices of exposed rocks where there is constant seepage; very occasion- ally it may occur as an aquatic phase in the small rock-pools which often occur associated with seepage-moistened rocks. The typical form, which is very rare in Minnesota, occurs in wet places, usually on rocks, or on submerged branches, and has entire leaf-margins (P1. 51:6, 8); it may be mistaken for Sc. irrigua, but differs from the latter in that the ventral lobes are very distinctly decurrent, and in the purplish to black stems that are con- trasted to the pure green leaves. The terrestrial form ("Sc. dentata") has denticulate leaf-margins (P1. 51:9), like Sc. nemorosa, which it much resembles.* It differs from nemorosa in the generally greenish, largely 2-celled gemmae (P1. 51:10) (all red-brown and 1-celled in nemorosa), as well as in the margined leaf-lobes, which bear 1-several rows of equally thick-walled cells, contrasted to the interior cells (as in P1. 51:3). In the field, distinction between the two species is quite difficult. The more frequent terres- trial form occurs as a pioneer on moist rocks, usually in little exposed places (such as north-facing cliff-walls and ledges), associated with Sc. subalpina, Sc. irrigua, Sc. nemo- rosa, etc. Sc. undulata can also be told from Sc. nemorosa by the transversely inserted dorsal leaf-lobes (P1. 51 6, 8); in nemorosa they are obliquely inserted and distinctly decurrent (P1. 51:11). Finally, the teeth of the leaves in dentate forms of undulata are formed of not or scarcely elongate (e.g., nearly isosceles triangular) cells (P1. 51:7); in nemorosa they are terminated by very elongate cells (P1. 51:13).

Muller P1. 51:9 Material approaching this variety, and intergrading with typical undulata, has been found by the writer at Grand Marais, occurring with more typical undulata. The variety gives the impression of being merely a vicarious form of the species. It differs from typical undulata (and from all local Scapaniaceae) in that some of the leaves have the keel armed with 1-several prominent multicellular teeth (P1. 51:9). SCAPANIA SUBALPINA (Nees) Dumort. P1. 51:3-5 Of restricted distribution throughout most of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, northward into the Tundra region; very rare in the northern edge of the Deciduous Region (see Schuster, 1949). In Minnesota with a distribution identical with, and perhaps even more restricted than the closely related Sc. undulata (see above). The species, like undulata (with which it frequently occurs, as at Grand Marais), is limited to moist rocks, where it is found either as a pioneer in sites close to running water or the edge of the wave and ice action zone (often with Marsupella emarginata), or on thin sand or gravelly soil over such sites. It occurs here most often with other Scapania species (Sc. undulata, irrigua, nemorosa) and Plagiochila asplenioides, occasionally Tritomaria quinquedentata. The species occurs in similar sites at the edges of ravines.* This is one of the easily recognized species of the genus: it is usually a pale, whitish green (except for the often brownish to blackish stem), and the small to extensive mats of the species stand out at some distance; in exposed sites it may become somewhat brown- ish or reddish-brown throughout, but it is never violet or purple tinged (as is nemorosa under such conditions). The most characteristic features of the species are the subequal leaf-lobes (P1. 51:4-5), both of them rounded or nearly, and both distinctly denticulate (P1. 51:3).t Only the much smaller and more delicate Sc. cuspiduligera has subequal leaf-lobes; in this species, however, they are entire-margined.t Distribution.-COOK: Little Susie I., Susie Is., S 14863, S 7247a, S 7248a, S 7240a, S 7239a; The Point, Grand Marais, S 13780, 13797, S 6528, S 6553a, S 6570, S 13261, S 6571, S 13796; Rosebush Falls, H; Grand Portage I., H; Grand Marais, H; Cascade River, C; Grand Marais, C 2655.

The species rarely occurs on banks near lakes (Deer Lake, Baraga Co., Mich.), there with Sc. irrigua. t Except in forms occurring in very wet sites, or occurring submerged; in such forms the lobes are quite entire-margined. t The two species usually differ conspicuously in size, though their pale greenish color is nearly the same. Well developed plants of Sc. ilubalpina rarely are less than 15 mm long, of Sc. cuspiduligera, over 12 mm long. The pale green gemmae of Sc. subalpina separate all forms occurring locally from Sc. cuspiduligera, which bears brown gemmae. Many forms of Sc. subalpina have conspicuously squarrose dorsal lobes (rare in S. undu- lata), much as the superficially similar Sc. cuspiduligera. Living plants of these can be told from Sc. cuspiduligera at once by the very small oil-bodies (less than 4-5 x 7 a, 4-5 per cell usually, vs. 1-3 per cell and up to 5-7 x 9-12 cl in cuspiduligera). Small forms of Sc. subalpina are often nearly impossible to separate from undulata, since these generally show reduced dorsal lobes.</page><page sequence="224">480 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Group NEMOROSAE SCAPANIA NEMOROSA (L.) Dumort. P1. 51:11-14 Extremely widely distributed throughout most of eastern North America, from the lower Austral to lower edge of the Tundra Region; a nearly ubiquitous species. In Minnesota restricted in distribution to the area of favorable water-balance (i.e. the cooler, moister northeastern half of the state), where it is widely distributed, and usually the most common species of its genus. Occurring almost always (as do the other species of the genus, except for the small epixylic species) associated with rock outcrops of some kind, the species being essentially epipetric. However, the compacted soil of the edges of paths may be invaded by the species, while it also occasionally invades decaying logs. Most frequent, however, as a pioneer or on thin soil over north or northwest facing cliffs and ledges, where it may form large, pale to characteristically purplish-tinged mats. The species has a wide pH tolerance, but never occurs under distinctly calcareous conditions (not over 7.5), nor does it appear able to hold its own when the pH goes below 5.0. The species thus is an initial or subinitial form, disappearing from cliff-faces when succession has proceeded to the point where dense peaty masses are formed whose decay lowers the pH to 4.8 or less. The species is essentially mesic, but may occur under almost xeric as well as distinctly hygric conditions. The large size (3-5 mm wide, up to 8 cm long) is as in the superficially identical undulata, and both forms possess denticulate leaf-margins. In nemorosa, reddish-brown or cinnamon colored gemmae always occur, however, and these are uniformly 1-celled (P1. 51:12). In undulata they are green (in exposed sites rarely reddish), and at maturity largely 2-celled (P1. 51:10). In undulata the leaf-margins bear a distinct border of several rows of equally thick-walled cells; in nemorosa the leaf-lobes are not or narrowly margined by a border of thicker-walled cells, and the cells- are all more or less collenchymatous (P1. 51:13). Sc. nemorosa is also likely to be confused with the extremely rare Sc. degeni'. Both have reddish-brown 1-celled gemmae, more or less convex dorsal lobes, and more or less denticulate leaf-margins. Sc. degenii differs most obviously in the non-decurrent dorsal and ventral leaf-bases, and in the generally merely distantly and slightly denticulate leaf- margins. Sc. nemorosa has both dorsal (P1. 51:11) and ventral (P1. 51:14) lobes quite distinctly decurrent*; in the dorsally decurrent lobes it differs from all other Scapaniaceae known from the state. The ventral lobes are often not as distinctly decurrent as in P1. 51:14, especially in impoverished or juvenile plants. Under critical conditions, the separation between S. nemorosa and undulata becomes a very difficult matter. Normally, the more sharply, spinous-dentate margins of the leaf- margins (more finely dentate, with scarcely elongate cells in S. undulata) and the rather distinctly reniform dorsal lobes (usually oval to suborbicular in S. undulata) will separate S. nemorosa. In almost all cases, the cinnamon brown gemmae of S. nemorosa separate it in the field from S. undulata, which normally has them a pale green. However, under extremely shaded, moist, sheltered conditions, S. nemorosa produces a mod. viridis-integrifolia-viridigemma-leptoderma, e.g., a modification with green leaves, entire (or obsoletely denticulate) leaf-margins, with greenish (or scarcely pale-brown tinged) gemmae, and with thin-walled cells (only the marginal row slightly thick-walled). Such plants give almost a perfect superficial impression of the mod. viridis-integrifolid (i.e., the undulata-form) of S. undulata. Such plants are to be separated from S. undu- lata by several difficultly perceptible characters, as follows: 1. The gemmae, though scarcely pigmented, are always 1-celled. * This pertains only to mature shoots; on impoverished or juvenile shoots the decur- rence may be very slight, and such individuals are scarcely determinable by the beginning student.</page><page sequence="225">11953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 481 2. The oil-bodies, in cells remote from gemmiparous areas (e.g., apices of gemmipar- ous leaf-lobes), occur very frequently only 3-4 per cell, with each oil-body up to 6 x 9 it, very obvious, and up to over half the length of the containing cell. Near gemmiparous regions, the oil-bodies also become smaller and spherical, and may occur up to 12-15 per cell; in extreme, subaquatic forms of S. nemorosa, the oil-bodies may get smaller everv' where in the plant, giving the cells the facies of S. undulata. (In S. undulata all forms of the plant agree in the relatively small oil-bodies, often 4-5 per cell, which scarcely obscure one-third of the cell area.) 3. The dorsal lobes of S. nemorosa, even under subaquatic conditions, retain their distinctly reniform, arched appearance, and remain somewhat convex; in S. undulata they are more nearly suborbicular, generally with the keel not at all arched. The dorsal lobes also arch widely across the stem, and are shortly decurrent at their bases in all forms of S. nemorosa; in S. undulata they arch not or slightly across the stem, and are non- decurrent. Buch (1928) has stressed as a separating feature of S. nemorosa the inability to develop a very discrete border of thick-walled marginal leaf-cells, contrasted to the interior cells; in S. undulata (and its allies, S. paludosa and subalpina) such a thick-walled border is supposedly very distinct, except in leptodermous, subaquatic extremes. However, in leptodermous-mesodermous forms of S. nemorosa, there may be a very discrete border of thick-walled marginal cells, 2-3, or even 4 cells wide, with the interior cells thin-walled, and with small, concave-sided trigones. Such a condition does not differ- appreciably from that considered typical of S. undulata. The writer, therefore, would stress that the differ- ences between the S. nemorosa complex (Group Nemorosae) and the S. undulata com- plex (Group Undulatae) in this regard are slight, and quantitative, rather than absolute. The very large oil-bodies of most cells of S. nemorosa (much like those of S. degenii in size) in the writer's opinion, offer a much safer means of separating the species from S. undulata and its allies, which all agree in the relatively small, inconspicuous oil-bodies.

Family HYGROBIELLACEAE* The single genus of this family from the present region is very easy to identify: it includes plants with closely itnbricate, deeply bilobed, transversely inserted, erect-appressed leaves, and a third row of very similar, subequally large underleaves. The plant thus shows a lesser degree of dorsiventrality than any other genus of this region, and is filifornn and thread-like in appear- ance. The cells are thin to equally thick-walled and oil-bodies are lacking. The rudimentary perianth is sheathed closely by the leaf-like bracts, and is deeply 6-lobed; it appears to represent nothing more than three bilobed leaves grown together at base. The branches originate in the axils of normal leaves. * The genus Anthelia, previously included in the Ptilidiaceae by all workers, was united with the genera Hygrobiella and Pleuroclada into the present family by K. Muller (1948) and by the writer (1949a). The genera Hygrobiella and Pleuroclada have been variously placed, usually either in the Ptilidiaceae or the Cephaloziaceae. The present family consists of a group of closely allied genera that are obviously only distantly related to 6ther families; it is believed to be a natural, homogeneous unit.</page><page sequence="226">482 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) ANTHELIA Dumort. One species occurs in the general region: ANTHELIA JURATZKANA (Limpr.) Trevis. Fig. 14:7-11 This species is essentially Arctic-alpine in distribution. It has been found at Pictured Rocks, Munising, Michigan, and may yet be found on the north shore of Lake Superior. The bluish-gray to gray-green plants have deeply bilobed leaves, with each lobe about 7-8 cells wide; they are nearly identical in size and form to the very large underleaves. The similarity in size of leaves and underleaves, together with the deeply bifid form of the leaves, is absolutely characteristic of the species. The leaves are more or less closely imbri- cate, giving the minute plant (only 2-5 mm long) a filiform appearance. Family CEPHALOZIELLACEAE The members of this family canl usually be distinguished from all other local liverworts by the size only; they are among the smallest known Bryo- phytes. The plants are only 1-8 (rarely 10-12) mm long, are filiform, with the leaves usually only a little wider, to at most twice as wide, as the stems (P1. 55:2, 4). In addition to size, there are other characteristics: the leaves are usualiy distant and are transversely inserted (P1. 55:2, 7), they are bilobed for ? - 3/4 their lengths (P1. 55:3), with the lobes only 2-9 cells broad at base (Pls. 52:10; 55:3). The underleaves are either small (P1. 52:1, 9) or absent (P1. 55:2). The perianths are terminal either on short or long postical shoots (P1. 55:2, or may even be terminal on what appear to be main shoots; they are closely sheathed by the bracts and more or less deeply 4-5-plicate; the mouth is always merely crenulate (P1. 54:4, 9). The rhizoids are usually scattered and few; they are not limited to the base of the underleaves (Pls. 52:1; 53:2). Finally, the small leaf-cells, only 8-16 ju wide, and 9-25 ,u long, with the walls thin or thick, but never showing trigones (P1. 52:1, 9), are a characteristic feature of the family; the cells have small oil-bodies (Fig. 6:1). There is a single genus locally, the species of which have been in a very chaotic condition, as regards their taxonomy. CEPHALOZIELLA Spruce The members of this genus are the most difficult of Hepaticae to identify, partly because of their minute size, partly because of the chaotic condition of their taxonomy. The following species occur in Minnesota, with one or two others that probably occur, entered into the key. In their determination the nature of the inflorescence must be ascertained. To accomplish this it is necessary to very carefully pull apart a small portion of a mat of the plants, making sure the older parts of an individual plant are not torn apart. If the plant is entirely sterile, it is usually a species that is dioecious; if only androe- cia occur in a mat (or only perianths) it is also obvious the species is dioe- cious. If both antheridia (on separate branches) and perianths occur, the species is autoecious (P1. 55:2). If the bracts below the perianth are large in several to many pairs (and ratlher concave), these bracts are antheridial</page><page sequence="227">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 483 bracts, and the inflorescence is paroecious (Pls. 53:1; 54:1). In at least one of our species (rubella) the inflorescence varies from autoecious to paroecious within the same patch. In identification, the presence or absence of under- leaves must also be determined. Since these are often only 2-3 cells large on sterile plants, the underside of a plant must be studied under high magnifica- tion (sometimes oil-immersion) before it is concluded that underleaves are lacking. Ulnderleaves nearly always occur on fertile shoots and on gemmae- bearinig shoots; mature sterile shoots therefore must be examined.* KEY TO SPECIES 1.

Muller (1947a) has done a great service in reducing the genera and species of Douin to synonymy. He has beex followed in this by both Schuster (1949, 1950) and S. Arnell (1950). The discussions by these workers should be referred to by the interested student, and that by Arnell, though on the Swedish species, is very pertinent to the present region, since the species are nearly all holarctic in distribution. In this connection, it must be noted, that the work by Frye and Clark, on this genus, is impossible to follow at many points. These workers, however, have done a considerable service in illustrating some of the "species" described by Douin, and in describing them (while Douin had merely cited them in his key, making recognition often impossible, as is readily evident to anyone who has had to cope with the mathematically precise defini- tions Douin attempted to impose upon an extremely plastic and variable group of organisms) .</page><page sequence="228">484 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 6.

[C. byssacea var. scabral CEPHALOZIELLA ELACHISTA (Jack) Schiffn. P1. 52:1-6 Widely distributed throughout the Coniferous Region, becoming very rare in isolated bogs in the northern edge of the Deciduous Zone. In Minnesota nearly restricted in distribution to the northern half of the state, but occurring westward to Angle Inlet. The species is a hygrophyte, occurring among Sphagnum in bogs, as a member of the Mylia Associule. Unlike Mylia anomala and Calypogeia sphagnicola, with which it is very often found, it occurs only in bogs and not on peaty hummocks capping the crests of cliffs. The species is very "calcifuge," occurring under a pH of 3.5-4.5. Other commonly associated species are Cephalozia connivens, pleniceps and media, Lophozia marchica, and occasion- ally Cladopodiella fluitans; occasionally it occurs with Cephaloziella rubelld. This species is the easiest of the species of Cephaloziella to identify: it is larger than most of them (up to 10 mm long), with very distant, spreading or squarrose leaves that are divided nearly to base into two divergent, narrowly lanceolate lobes, each of which is only 2-4 cells wide (P1. 52:1, 5). The most characteristic feature about the leaves are the unusually large cells (20-30 ,u long and 13-16 A wide), and the presence (on most leaves) of one or several sharp, spinous basal teeth (P1. 52:1). When perianths are present the many recurved-spinous teeth of the bracts are absolutely diagnostic. This species is closely related only to C. subdentata. As in that species, the leaves have a tendency to be armed with basal teeth, and the bracts are free from each other and the bracteole (or only very slightly connate at base). In our other species the cells are very small and usually more nearly isodiametric, rarely over 15 ,u long, the leaves are entirely unarmed, and the bracts and bracteole are united (for about half their length) into a cup- like structure that sheaths the base of the perianth.</page><page sequence="229">1953 SCI-IUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 485 . / 2. 5. - 4. ~~~ ~~~ ~8. 9. 0 PLATE 52.

(_ striatula Jensen) Fig. 14:6; P1. 52:7-10 This rare species has been reported a single time from the United States, from western New York (Schuster, 1949). It is a xeromorphic type allied closely to C. elachista, but has an essentially more northern, largely Arctic-Alpine range. In Minnesota it appears confined to a region of a few square miles in the northeastern corner of the state. The species here occurs in two different habitats: on the elevated hummocks of Sphagnum near open bog edges (as at Grand Portage Bog), associated with Mylia Calypogeia sphagnicola, Cephalozia loitlesbergeri, Riccardia latifrons, etc., and on the peaty, exposed, rather strongly insolated crests of cliffs and ledges (as on the Susie Is- lands); here it is found essentially with the same group of species, and under ecologically nearly equivalent conditions. The most striking thing about the species is its consistently more xeric occurrence, compared with the closely allied C. eldchista. The latter, though common in bogs, always occurs under unusually moist conditions; it appears never to be able to invade dry, sunny Sphagnum hummocks capping the crests of cliffs. The pH range of the peat on which the species is found ranges between .3.9 and 4.5. In general there is little difficulty in distinguishing this species from C. elachista, but individuals occur that are nearly intermediate. C. subdentata differs from elachista in normally having more pachydermous, usually pigmented cells (P1. 52:9-10), in having the cells considerably smaller, averaging 9-12 , wide (rarely 13 jU wide) x 15-20 ,u long, in having the cuticle distinctly papillose and that of the stem striolate (Pls. 52:10; in 52:9 not drawn in). One of the most obvious differences of the species lies in the nearly constant absence of the basal spinous teeth of the leaves (compare P1. 52: 1 and 9). The stem cells of C. subdentata are also smaller and generally more thick-walled; they average 9-15 x 20-25 ,U or less. The plants are very usually fertile, and generally reddish-brown to purplish pigmented: they normally occur as isolated, scattered plants, over dead peat, and are evident because of the color contrast (in spite of their minute size).* The peri- anths offer another useful, if not absolute means of distinction: the bracts of subdentata generally have none or few of the teeth recurved-spinose (P1. 52:8), though occasional ones may be spinose (P1. 52:7). When spores are present, the small spores (7-9 ,u) also help in distinguishing the species from elachista (spores 8-11 /,).4 *More than half of the Minnesota records listed below represent accidental discover- ies of scattered plants among members of the Mylia-Odontoschisma denudatum Associule. The plant rarely occurs in sufficient quantity to make its discovery in the field possible. f Our North American material appears to belong largely or entirely to the form separated by Douin as C. turftcea Douin. Arnell (1950, p. 85) states that the latter is: "probably . . . a variety of C. subdentata. It differs from the main type by very narrow (2-3 cells broad) leaves with very long and acute lobes and very long and acute lobes of the female bracts also. It often forms beautiful red-colored coverings on tufts of Sphag- num. . .. The plant differs considerably from typical C. subdentata, but connecting forms are seen." The writer can attest to the veracity of this latter statement, and would not even attempt to maintain C. turfacea as a variety. Belonging in this same complex is the plant separated as C. angustiloba Douin, which has slightly larger leaf-cells (thus approaching C. elachista). Douin (1920) keys it out both with C. elachista and with C. subdentata (= striatula). Frye and Clark have totally confused this entity with a form</page><page sequence="231">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 487 Confusion is unlikely with other species, except for the rubella complex. The presence of distinct (even if minute) underleaves, together with the constantly autoecious inflores- cences, as well as the extremely narrow, slender leaf-lobes, will separate subdentata from rubella.

The species is otherwise known only from New York (Schuster, 1949), from near Cheboygan, Michigan, from Mt. Katahdin, Maine (Schuster), from near Zealand Falls, New Hampshire (Schuster), and from Mt. Monadnock, New Hampshire (Schuster 19456), in the United States. Persson (1947) cites reports from Alaska, and (1946) summarizes the North American distribution, which then included only the east coast of Greenland (Fleming Inlet; Hurry Inlet; Rydersdal; Turner Sound, fide Jensen, 1906), northeast Greenland (Dove Bugt, 76040', fide Jensen, 1910), St. Lawrence I., Alaska, and British Columbia. The additional stations cited by Persson expand the range for the species, for Alaska, but the writers' reports remain, to date, the only ones from the United States. It appears certain that the species has been much overlooked and misdetermined in this country. CEPHALOZIELLA ELEGANS (Heeg) K. Muller (C. myriantha, in small part) Fig. 6:1; P1. 53:1-7 Of extremely restricted occurrence, and apparently rare wherever found. Since the species was reported but once before from North America (Sudbury, Ontario), its range and ecological relationships are almost unknown. In Minnesota, known from a single local- ity, and there occurring in crevices of igneous rocks, among the much more ubiquitous C. rubella. The species is to be confused only with C. rubella and C. hampeana. Like the former, it has the cells quite thick-walled (P1. 53:7), and a generally paroecious inflorescence (P1. 53:1). Like the latter, it has the leaf-lobes ovate on sterile shoots (P1. 53:2, 7), and 6- 10 or even twelve cells broad.* The species differs from rubelld and hampeana both in of C. grimsulana that Douin described as C. grimsulana var. angustiloba. The description in Frye and Clark appertains to one, the illustration to the other, of these Douin "crea- tions." This is readily evident when the confused synonymy they cite is compared with Douin (1920). Furthermore, though Frye and Clark report both C. grimsulana and C. grimsulana var. angustiloba (nec Douin) from North America, neither is an American plant. The writer would consider the real C. angustiloba (described from the United States, without further data, by Douin, 1920) as synonymous with C. subdentata. It is a form very similar to C. turfacea, with slightly larger cells, 12-15 ,u wide at the leaf- bases. The detailed discussion in Schuster (1949) may be referred to in this connection (as well as the complete set of illustrations). * C. rubella may also have the leaf-lobes 6-9 cells wide on the leaves of fertile shoots: therefore, the utmost caution must be exercised to make sure that sterile shoots are studied. Furthermore, C. rubella usually shows minute underleaves on the tips of shoots that are sterile below, but appear to be developing androecia, or gemmae. In addition, undoubted forms of rubella (such as sullivantii) may show occasional small underleaves. The two species are undoubtedly "uncomfortably" close, and Persson (1946) unites elegans and pulchella both with typical rubella. The older reports in the American literature (up to and including Frye and Clark, 1945), under the name "C. myriantha" must be re-exam- ined.

The broad-leaf-lobes alone are enough to separate it from typical rubella. The very small thick-walled cells, and paroecious inflorescence are enough to separate it from C. hamn- peana. Because of the broad leaf-lobes and distinct underleaves sterile material may be con- fused with C. starkei (C. byssacea) The latter is, however, usually purplish-brown to purplish-red pigmented, has the underleaves much larger (often 1V4 the size of the lateral leaves), and has larger leaf-cells. Arnell (1950) also agrees with Persson in doubting the validity of this "species." He states "This rare paroecious species has a characteristic cell-net with small cells (6-8 i, seldom 12) with usually uniformly thickened cell-walls. The leaves are deeply divided, usually more than to one-half, male and female bracts slightly dentate. It seems chieflv to grow on soil or between other mosses on stones, but also on rotten wood. It is difficult to distinguish from thick-walled forms of C. rubella, which species may also be paroecious, but which as a rule has larger cells and not so broad lobes of the leaves. . . . I think Dr. H. Persson is right in placing C. elegans as forma elegans (Heeg) H. Persson under C. rubella and that this form can hardly be retained as a species, at most it should be a sub- species or variety of C. rubelld." The latter opinion was independently arrived at by the writer (Schuster, 1950), who propose.d the combination C. rubella var. elegans, unaware, at the time of Arnell's concepts.

CEPHALOZIELLA RUBELLA (Nees) Douin (C. myriantha, in largest part) P1. 54 The present species is widety distributed in the northern part of the Deciduous Region, and throughout the Coniferous Region. In Minnesota found, so far, chiefly in the Coniferous Region. The species is a pioneer on denuded, leached, sterile, acid soil, where it occurs often with Lophozia bicrenata or the ecologically similar L. excisa (forming a distinct Lophozia bicrenata-Cephaloziella Associule, of pioneer nature).* In my experi- en-ce very often a distinct xerophyte (more so than hampeana), and often forming red- dish-brown to blackish extensive patches, that are always abundantly fertile. Ihe species is often found in exposed and relatively sunny localities, where it may be quite dry, except for short periods after rains. The species is distinguished by its abundant fertility, and by the normally largely paroecious inflorescences (P1. 48:1, 14). It is sometimes difficult to distinguish from hampeana, but has narrower leaf-lobes, usually only 3-4-5 cells wide on sterile shoots (P1. 54:11-12), with the cell-walls usually quite strongly thickened. The species is extremely variable: Douin (1920) and Buch (1936) distinguish an autoecious variety (bifida Lindb.), while C. sullivantii (previously considered distinct) is now considered merely a variety of it by Muller (1947). Var. bifida Lindb. Doubtfully distinct, differing in the autoecious inflorescences. Our local material is usually partly autoecious, partly paroecious: indicating the differentiation is probably without much significance.j * As on the crest of cliffs at Rainy Lake, near Island View. It may also replace C. starkei in the Gymnocolea2Cephaloziella Associule. See p. 494. 4 In my experience rubella usually shows more androecia than female inflorescences, indicating that commonly additional androecia are produced, other than those below the female inflorescences. The species is thus partly autoecious, partly paroecious. In addi- tion, one can usually find at least a few female inflorescences that lack the large perigonal bracts below the perichaetial ones: indicating not all the female inflorescences are sub- tended by androecia. Therefore, usually a number of inflorescences must be studied, and if some are found that are unquestionably paroecious, it can be concluded that C. rubella (or the very close C. elegans) is at hand.</page><page sequence="234">490 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) A Sk ' ~~~~~~~~~I/ XDX 9 ~~~~~10.

It occurs chiefly on decaying logs, is usually only 1-2 mm high, and has perianths that are virtual- ly as wide at the mouth as at the middle, and quite short (P1. 54:1). The leaf-cells are sometimes slightly smaller (mostly 10-12 jA wide), and often more nearly thin-walled (P1. 54:5). The ring of bracts is often 7-9 lobed (P1. 54:7-8), with the lobes sharply den- tate (but, as noted by Meylan in material determined by Douin, may be only 5-6 lobed). MIuller has criticized retention of sullivantii as a distinct species, and states that Douin attempted to keep them apart on an entirely artificial and inductive basis. Other characters that separate this form are the short cells of the perianth-mouth, 1.5-2 times as long as wide on an average (P1. 54:4), and the frequent presence of minute underleaves, even on sterile shoots. In the presence of minute underleaves of sterile shoots the present variety tends to grade into elegans. Unlike C. elegans, the leaf-lobes of sterile shoots are always 3-5 cells wide at base (P1. 54:5), and the cells average 10 A wide or more. The variety has been previously reported only from decaying logs, but I have material before me col- lected over dead moist peat, from a peaty field near Ham Lake, Anoka Co.* Var. pulchella (C. Jens.) Douin. This appears to represent a luxurious form of the species; it has been reported by Conard (1945) from the Iowa bordert adjoining Min- nesota, and by Cain and Fulford from Ontario (1948). No other reports are at hand from North America. Muller (1947) claims it is nothing more than a slightly larger form of rubella, a view which appears to be completely warranted. This variety is known to me only from a single certain Minnesota collection, as follows: rather dry Chameadaphne heath bog, 8 miles s. of Grand Rapids, Itasca Co., Minnesota (associated with C. elachista and Cephalozia pleniceps and connivens), Schuster 14112, August, 1947. The var. pulchella has led an extremely checkered history, being first considered a good species by Jensen, but later merely a variety of hampeana (fide K. Muller). Both Muller and Macvicar give it as a variety of hampeana, but Muller (1947) reverses his earlier stand and now considers it as closest to, and specifically not distinct, from C. rubella. In assigning it to rubella, he followg Douin (1920), who states that the leaf- lobes are almost as in rubella, and the paroecious inflorescence commonly found would also ally it to rubella. In my estimate Douin is completely correct: the plant has the entire general appearance of rubella (s. lat.), and is undoubtedly extremely close to rubel- la, if not merely a variant of it. Douin separates pulchella from rubella essentially because of the larger leaf cells (12- 18 ,u wide), larger spores (10-12 ,u), and the denticulate margins of the perigonal bracts. Muller stresses the variability of all of these characters, and therefore assigns the species as a variety under a more polymorphic rubella. In the local material the cells are uni- formly very large, haphazardly selected measurements averaging at the base of the lobes 13.5, 14, 15, 16.5, 16.5, 17.5 ,u wide per cell; the cell walls are rather strongly thick- ened (unlike much other material assigned to pulchella). The spores, however, are merely 9-10, rarely 10.5 A in diameter (in typical rubella mostly 7.2-9.5 AL). Distribution.-CARLTON: Carlton, C 650.

Extremely restricted in occurrence, with the range only imperfectly known in North America. The form appears to be a strongly Subalpine-subarctic to Arctic-alpine type.* * The North American distribution is problematical for several reasons. Douin (1920) and Miiller (1947) regard C. lorenziana from Connecticut as autoecious, and the former describes it as with underleaves. The latter considers it a synonym of C. arctica (and therefore of C. alpina). It agrees with C. alpina in the leaf-lobes with thin-walled cells and 6-9 cells wide; Frye and Clark (1944) describe it as "probably unisexual but male inflorescence not seen." and state that "In the few plants available to us we were not able to identify the underleaves with certainty." Frye and Clark (l.c.) totally con- fuse C. grimsulana (a European species not known from North America) with C. alpina, as is evident from the synonymy they cite (p. 521). They describe C. alpina as "uni- sexual," and illustrate plants (from Idaho); their material, if unisexual (dioecious) certain- ly does not belong under C. alpina, which all authorities on the genus agree in considering autoecious. Probably the plant they describe and illustrate as C. alpina (judging only from figures and description) is C. byssacea. They figure a "flagellum" with small underleaves (our Cephaloziella species do not produce flagellae, but occasionally juvenile or attenuate shoots that have smaller leaves). These authors also place C. alpina (at best dubiously distinct from C. arctica) and C. lorenziana (a synonym of C. alpina and arctica fide Miller) in the so-called Subgenus "Byssacae" while C. arctica is placed in the Subgenus "Hampeanae." Whether one treats C. alpina as a distinct species, separate from C. alpina, or not, it must certainly be admit- ted that K. Muller is correct in stressing the very close relationships between the two. Further study of more adequate material may show that Miiller is correct in uniting the two. Frye and Clark incorrectly place C. grimsulana sensu K. Mill. as a synonym under C. alpina. Miiller, however, described and figured his material from the type of grim- sulana, which is a very distinct species, separate in the wide leaf-cells (over 14 j, wide, on an average), the more robust size, etc. I have studied a generous sample of the type of C. grimsulana (leg. K. Muller), and this plant does not agree with any plant found in North America. The reports of C. grimsulana cited by Frye and Clark (p. 551) do not appear to refer to C. grimsulana. Although these writers cite C. grimsulana K. Muill. as a synonym of C. alpina (p. 521) they inexplicably copy his drawings of the former under what they call C. grimsulana (p. 550); this is not grimsulana as to type. Frye and Clark further increase the already confused situation by citing a C. grimsu- lana var. angustiloba (p. 551), which represents a conglomeration of two unrelated things. 1. a plant very close, and probably a modification of C. subdentata Wstf. (their Fig. 4, based on the C. angustiloba Douin, the type of which came from the United States, fide Douin, 1920), and 2. a plant described by Douin as C. grimsulana var. angustiloba, which appears to be a minor variant of C. grimsulana. The plant they cite under "C. grimsulana var. angustiloba (Douin) Joerg." is therefore an unnatural aggregation of a form of C. grimsulana (to which the authors' citation refers), while the description and type citation applies to the quite unrelated C. subdentata. This chaotic nomenclatorial mix-up will be treated, and it is hoped clarified, at length in another connection.</page><page sequence="237">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 493 The few collections of the species the writer has made came from exposed ledges, either of calcareous slate or of basic igneous rocks. The species, as also noted by Arnell (1950) appears to be a distinct calciphyte. The associated species (see under distribution) all were either calciphytes, or lime-tolerant. At both localities the distinct obligatory calci- phyte, Scapania gymnostomophila occurred very close by, if not admixed. In Minnesota the species is also found with, sometimes forming the matrix for, the rare ferns, Woodsia scopulina and cathcartiana. It is possible that other North American reports of C. harm- peana from calcareous sites may refer in part to this species. C. alpina is regarded as a synonym of C. arctica by K. Muller (1947). The writer has not seen enough material of the latter (though the type and European specimens have been seen) to have any certain personal opinion. Since I have seen no specimens inter- mediate to C. arctica, I prefer, for the time being to retain C. alpina as a discrete variety. C. alpina is a plant with thin-walled cells, and with the leaf-lobes mostly 6-8 cells wide, occasionally wider (P1. 53:8, 9); it frequently bears a reddish-purple pigmentation, but apparently never becomes really reddish-brown (unlike C. rubella); in extreme cases it becomes purplish-black, with dry patches of plants slightly gleaming, thread-like, and virtually blackish in appearance. In the autoecious inflorescence, with the saccate male bracts forming intercalary compact, spike-like androecia on branches usually issuing from below the perianth-bearing shoots, the species closely resembles C. hampeana. It further resembles that species in the broad leaf-lobes, and more or less thin-walled cells. The plants I place h-ere as C. arctica, however, uniformly show small underleaves, usually linear and only 2-4 cells long on sterile shoots (P1. 53:9, 11-13); in C. hampeana the sterile plants uniformly lack underleaves. I have not been able to discover other differ- ences that I could regard as constant. C. arctica is reported as having the spores 9-12 It in diameter.* This 'appears to be a very flimsy character for the separation of the species. The writer would therefore regard C. alpina as being closely related to C. hampeana. Since the underleaves are usually easily demonstrated, even under the high dry power of the microscope, the species should not be confused with C. hampeana. However, the autoecious inflorescence is often very difficult to demonstrate, since by the time perianths are produced, the older portions of the stems, which connect the perianth-bearing shoots and androecia-Uearing branches are usually dead and disintegrate on dissection. The plants therefore often give the impression of being dioecious, with male and female plants intimately intermixed. In both of the collections here referred to C. arctica it was possible to definitely dissect out plants showing a connection between the shoots of both sexes. Such dioecious appearing shoots would be keyed out to C. byssacea (starkei), with which C. arctica shares many features, among them: broad leaf-lobes, tendency towards purplish pigmentation, small but discrete underleaves. It is therefore evident that in the identifi- cation of the species, the greatest care must be exercised in its differentiation from both C. hampeana and C. byssacea.t * In the Minnesota plants referred here, they are 9-10 ju. In the material from Michi- gan I refer here, they are only 8-9 IU. t Arnell (1950, p. 85) has recently studied this species in Europe, where he finds it a common species in the northern mountains of Sweden, "especially in places where the soil is not too acid." He emphasizes some of its distinctive features, such as the relatively large cells, "which as a rule have thin, often dark-coloured walls. The tips of the leaves will mostly take a characteristic reddish brown-violet shade. The lobes of the leaves are subovate-ovoid and the leaves somewhat concave, which all give it a somewhat different habit than the otherwise similar C. starkei [= byssacea]. The amphigastriae are not so well developed as on C. starkei." Arnell also makes the interesting point, confirmed by the few local collections, that: "This species seems to endure calcium in the substrate well and is clearly more common in regions with calcareous soil."</page><page sequence="238">494 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Distribution.-COOK: Mt.

The species occurs, often admixed with other mosses and Hepaticae, over cliffs or around rock-pools, almost never on sterile, acid soils, on humus, or on logs. Usually a mesophyte, occasionally occurring under xeric conditions; the species appears to be more common under basic or sub-basic conditions than other species of the genus (except C. arctica).

The relatively wide leaf- lobes, together with the inflorescence, are usually enough to identify this plant. The species shares these characters with the rare C. arctica var. alpina, from which it can often be scarcely separated.

So far unknown from Minnesota, but reported by Frye and Clark from Quetico Park, Rainy River District, Ontario (Drexler), and certainly to be found in adjacent areas of Minne- sota. The variety, like typical byssacea, occurs usually on cliffs and ledges, or on thin soil over such rock-outcrops. It frequents exposed and fairly strongly insolated areas, espe- cially where there is considerable seepage, and where the rock-outcrops are not calcareous. Often associated with Cephalozia bicuspidata, Gymnocolea, etc. This form, when well-developed, is easily separable from all other Hepaticae in our region: it bears conical protuberances on the outer (abaxial) leaf-surface, formed by 1-3 cells (PI. 55:7). Unfortunately, many plants of the variety bear only low papillae, or bear the conical processes on only a few isolated leaves. Other, intermingled plants, may lack them altogether and indicate either intergradation or admixture with typical C. bys- sacea. The variety has the large underleaves (which, occasionally also bear conical papil- lae) of the species (PI. 55:6), and agrees with it in its other characters, but very general- ly has the cells a little more thick-walled on leaves and stem, and occasionally slightly smaller. Muler (1947) synonymized C. papillosa Douin under C. starkei var. scabra Howe. In this he was followed by Schuster (1949), who however, used the apparently valid, earlier species name, C. byssacea. Arnell (1950) has re-emphasized the fact that Roth's J. byssacea consisted of two species of Cephaloziella, only one of which is byssacea. In the writer's opinion, few if any names in the genus that go back as early as to Roth's * Arnell (1950) correctly comments on the polymorphic nature of this species. He states that "the copper-brown, rather long-grown form that grows on rocks and stones seems to be the most common in Sweden. It often has its lobes folded upwards towards the top of the stem and the incision between them is rather often notch-like and folded downwards. . . . Transitional forms between the riain type and such with dorsal teeth, nzammillae and ? dentate leaves are rather common." In this he confirms the observa- tions of Schuster (1949). According to Arnell, the species "is shorter and broader . . . on open soil . . . and there are also larger forms here with broader leaves and lobes, which often have the bases of the leaves going out from the stem at an angle of 900 and have abruptly up- wards folded lobes. Here again the margin of the sinus is also often folded downwards and transitional forms to var. scabra are rather common. . . . In the mountains to the north there are forms with the leaves ? patent to the stem and rather narrow lobes and often slightly developed amphigastriae; these are often difficult to distinguish from feeble forms of C. arctica." In my limited experience with these two species, I find that this latter species is predominantly calcicolous (or at least lime-tolerating), while C. byssacea is a strictly oxylophytic species.

Both Schuster (1949, pp. 548, 703) and Arnell (1950:88) give excellent detailed reasons why C. papillosa Douin cannot be maintained as a discrete species. However, this unstable form or variety is treated in Frye and Clark as a subgenus (Subgenus Papil- losae), distinct from C. byssacea (which is placed in "Subgenus Byssacae," together with a heterogeneous assemblage of largely unrelated species). Frye &amp; Clark regard the "Papillosae" (neither this subgenus, nor any other of the artificial groups they set up are provided with Latin diagnoses, so are invalid on nomenclatorial grounds) as composed of six distinct taxa. It appears desirable to clear the nomenclature, as follows: Cephaloziella byssacea (Roth) Wstf. Cephaloziella starkei (Funk) Schiffner. var. scabra (Howe) Schuster, The Amer. Midl. Nat. 42:548, 1949. Cephalozia divaricata var. scabra Howe, Mem. Torr. Bot. Club 7:129, 1899. Cephaloziella papillosa var. heterophylla Frye &amp; Clark, Univ. Wash. Publ. Biol. 6:511, 1944 (new synonymy). Cephaloziella starkii var. heterophylla Douin ex Haynes, Ann. Bryol. 11:85, 1938 (new synonymy). Cephaloziella papillosa var. sinuata Frye &amp; Clark, Univ. Wash. Publ. Biol. 6:512, 1944 (new synonymy). Cephaloziella holzingeri Douin, Soc. Bot. France, Mem. 29:73, 1920 (new synonymy) . Of the other two taxa treated in the "Papillosae" by Frye &amp; Clark, C. scabrifolia Douin &amp; Schiffner ex Douin possibly is a synonym of C. byssacea var. scabra, but tlhe plant is too briefly described to make a decision clear. On the other hand, C. spinicaulis Douin, appears to be a good species, judging from limited personal collections. The reasons for the above synonymy are briefly: (1) every single one of the "taxa" synony- mized above can be found within any one considerable patch of plants of what is today recognized as C. byssacea var. scabra: (2) C. byssacea is not only a polymorphic, but also possibly pleomorphic species; therefore, if species and varieties are to be recognized on the basis adopted by Frye &amp; Clark, the number of species and varieties that could be recognized in C. byssacea would go from the rather large number recognized by Douin to the mathematically infinite. Since the species is largely sterile, and reproduces almost exclusively by gemmae, there is evident persistence, over long periods of time, and conse- quently spreading, of very minor genetic variations. The danger here exists that we may come to consider the clone as a taxonomic unit-with the variety elevated to subgenus. Family CEPHALOZIACEAE The family here is delimited narrowly (as in Miitler, 1948), excluding the Odontoschismaceae. As cdelimited, it includes plants with uniformly bi- lobed (P1. 56:3, 6), mostly succubously inserted lateral leaves, and with minute or no underleaves. The cells always have walls of a very equal thick- ness (P1. 56:1-2, 6) (i.e., are quite non-collenchymatous), are often relatively large and generally somewhat hyaline and often pellucid: the plants are there- fore very generally a pale or even whitish green (more rarely with reddish or brownish secondary pigmentation). The cells have either no oil-bodies at all or have them minute. The branches are largely or entirely ventral in origin (P1. 57:12), and the sexual branches are uniformly ventral in origin (Pls. 57:12; 58:7). The female inflorescences are usually on short ventral branches (Pls. (57:1-2; 58:7), and the perianths are typically trigonous in cross-section, widest near the base and more or less evenly tapering towards the mouth (Pls. 57:12; 58:7; 59:11). Many of the species are able to produce postical flagellae (P1. 61:9), as in the related Odontoschismaceae. The sporophytes have the seta</page><page sequence="242">498 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) usually reduced to 4 inner and 8 outer rows of cells, and the capsule wall is normally only bistratose, as in the Oclontoschismaceae; as in that family, the elaters are nearly equal in diameter to the spores. The three local genera of the family are composed of small (0.25 mm wide x 8 mm long) to moderate (1.5 mm wide x 2-3 cm long) species, always grow- ing rather closely appressed to the substrate by scattered, long rhizoids, that never occur in restricted areas (Pls. 56:4; 58:7).

Nowellia 'CEPHALOZIA Dumort. This genus of small or minute species includes a rather large number of local species. The chief characters by which it can be recognized in the field is the pure green (rarely whitish-green, occasionally somewhat brownish to blackish) coloratioli, and the bilobed leaves which in most of our species are somewhat orbicular (Pls. 58:7; 59:6), and often have lobes that are pointed towards each other (i.e., are colinivent) (Pls. 58:4, 7; 59:10; 61:1). The species, furthermore, are quite small (from about 0.3 to 1 mm wide), rarely more than 1.5 cm long, with the leaves always rather distant and never dis- tinctly itbricate (P1. 56:3-4, 6). In most of our species the leaves are very horizontally spreading, and the entire plant is strongly appressed to the sub- strate and appears quite flattened (P1. 61:2). The technical characters by which the genus may be recognized are more absolute than the above charac- ters (which, however, lend the group a distinct facies). They are: the trigon- ous perianth, occurring normally on short (rarely elongate) ventral branches (Pls. 61:2; 58:7); the large, more or less pellucid layer of cortical stem cells that are distinctly larger tlhan the inner, medullary cells (which are evident by * It is probable that the Cephaloziellaceae and Odontoschismaceae (treated as families here) should be considered as subfamilies of the Cephaloziaceae. This is suggested by Schuster (1949a), who recognized the three Subfamilies Cephalozielloideae, Cephalo- zioideae and Odontoschismoideae here. Study of the exotic representatives of these three taxa indicates that no sharp family distinctions can be maintained. For the sake of sim- plicity and uniformity, the writer adheres to the usages of Miiller (1939-1940) here, but would emphasize this is done purely for practical reasons.</page><page sequence="243">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 499 transmitted light as a central strand) (Pls. 59:7; 60:2; 61:2-4); the non- collenchymatous leaf-cells, with uniform walls (P1. 56:1, 6); the absence of oil-bodies; the lack (except near iliflorescences) of underleaves (Pls. 56:4; 61:3). All of our species (except C. bicuspidata and lammersiana) are locally restricted to acid sites rich mi organic materials: they therefore occur most often on peat, humus, or decayiiig logs, or on peaty banks or ledges. C. bi- cuspidata and lammersiana, however, are pioneers on sunny, exposed, acid rocks that are usually moist because of seepage or capillary action*; they are also our only species that have any trace of brownish pigmentation. Conifusion is likely between the smallest species (leucantha, macounii) and the larger species of Cephaloziella (elachista, etc.). The former do have nearly totally transverse, elongate leaves, but have the perianth-mouth with teeth 1-2 cells long (P1. 57:12); the latter have absolutely transverse leaves that are as wide or wider than long, and have a crenulate perianth mouth. The species of Cephalozia all agree in lacking distinct oil-bodies (though occa- sionally minute oil-globules occur in the cells), while obvious oil-bodies occur in Cephaloziella.

CEPHALOZIA LEUCANTHA Spruce P1. 56:1-4 This species has been previously reported once from the United States, from Washing- ton. This, therefore, represents the first record of the species from eastern United States.11 The species is a subarctic-subalpine one, previously reported in North America from New- foundland, Quebec, to Nova Scotia, west to the Yukon, Alaska, and British Columbia, south to Washington. The very small size (individual plants varying from 4 to 8, rarely 16 mm long), fili- form appearance, with the distant, subtransverse, ovate leaves only little wider than the stem, and the pale green or whitish color are distinctive. The species will probably be found by accident only: since it occurs mostly as creeping, isolated stems scattered among bryophytes, in our area. In Cook County the writer found it creeping among Odonto- schisma denuddtum, over peaty moist soil, at the edge of Sphagnum masses occurring on the seepage moistened crests of shaded cliffs and ledges. The species has also been frequently reported from decaying wood. According to K. Muiller it has a restricted dis- tribution, altitudinally, and very rarely occurs below 1800 feet near its southern limit. The present record, from at about 650 feet, is therefore all the more notable. The species is decidedly "calciphobous," and occurs on Big Susie island under pH conditions of from about 4.0-5.6. * These two species inseparable on the basis of sterile material. t Sterile plants very difficultly separable from the following two. : These two species inseparable on the basis of sterile material. ?

In the minute size it approaches Cephalo2iella as well as Cephalozia macounii. The small cells (12-16 jL wide), with thickened walls and the nearly transverse leaves increase this resemblance (P1. 56:1-2). The ovate leaves and pellucid stem cells at once separate it from Cephalo- -iella. Separation from C. macounii is more difficult. The latter has the leaf-lobes very narrow, mostly merely 2-3 cells wide at base (P1. 57:5, 11), and the sinus descending about 2/3 the leaf-length; furthermore, it is found only on decaying wood; when fertile, the dentate female bracts and ciliolate perianth are distinctive (P1. 57:6-9, 12). In C. leucantha the leaf-lobes are triangular, 3-5 cells wide at base (P1. 56:1-2), and the leaf- sinus descends but little more than half the leaf-length. When fertile, the shallowly bi- lobed female bracts, with the sinuses descending less than half their length, and with the margins quite unarmed, are distinctive; the lobes of the bracts are furthermore merely acute or even obtuse, never acuminate. The perianth-mouth in leucantha also varies from crenulate to shortly dentate (with few of the teeth two cells long). C. leucantha (as the name aptly implies) is a whitish plant, while macounii is usual- ly a purer green and more obviously chlorophyllose. Both of these species look like very minute forms of C. bicuspidata, because of the ovate, nearly transverse, deeply bilobed leaves. Both species differ from bicuspidata in their much smaller size (shoots with leaves merely 160-225 ,u wide; in bicuspidata 450-1000 # wide), and in their narrower leaves that are normally at most 8-10 cells wide. Unlike bicuspidata, the plants never bear flagellae. Distribution.-COOK: South end of Big Susie I., Susie Is., S 14748. CEPHALOZIA MACOUNII (Aust.) Aust. P1. 57:5-12 This minute species has a scattered distribution throughout the Coniferous Region, and has been reported from Maine and New Hampshire, west to Wisconsin and British Columbia. Like C. catenulata, to which it is closely related, C. macounii occurs restricted to shaded, decaying logs. At the single Minnesota locality it is found on the shaded sides of moist, decayed logs lying in the deep shaded ravine of the Encampment River. Here it is found as scattered stems among Cephalo2ia catenulata and lacinulata, Odontoschisma denudatum, Anastrophyllum michauxii and hellerianum, and Jamesoniella. The species is apt to be confused only with C. lacinulata and C. leucantha: with both of which it may occur on decaying logs. All three have in common ovate non-decurrent leaves with narrow, lanceolate lobes less than 4-5 cells wide at base (P1. 57:11-12), a nearly transverse leaf-insertion, and dioecious inflorescences. It differs from the first spe- cies at once by the much smaller, more thick-walled cells, which are merely 12-15 tu wide x 15-20 jL long (P1. 57:5, 11), as well as by the dentate margins of the bilobed female bracts (P1. 57:6-9). The distinction from C. leucantha is more difficult: the leaves of macounii are generally more narrowly ovate, and have generally narrower lobes, most of which are only 2-3 cells wide at base (vs. 3-5 in leucantha); the female bracts of macounii are sharply toothed, and bilobed for 1/2 - 2/3 their length, with the lobes quite acumi- nate (entire-margined and merely bilobed 1/4 - 2/5 in leucantha); finally, the perianth- mouth of C. macounii is more longly dentate, with the fine teeth largely 2-3 cells long (in leucantha 1-2 cells long). Juvenile plants of C. catenulata may be mistaken for macounii, since the cells are equal in size in the two species (or nearly), and thick-walled in both. However, some more mature leaves with the lobes 4-5-6 cells wide at base canl usually be found, and such leaves are always broadly ovate to quadrate-orbicular in catenu- lata, never narrowly ovate as in macounii. The ovate leaf form and nearly transverse leaf- insertion appears to be the most constant separating characters from catenulata. In the very few Minnesota plants seen, fertile shoots of macounii had some leaves of 7-9 cells wide (with the lobes 4 or even 5 cells broad at base) (P1. 57:10), and thus approached catenulata. The leaf-form, however, was distinctly elongate and obviously ovate, and the lobes were narrow and gradually tapering; furthermore the leaves were virtually transverse-</page><page sequence="249">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 505 2..

Distribution.-Encampment R., S 13438b (only enough material for a slide was found at this, the only station for the species in the area; it therefore deserves emphasis that all of the illustrations of the species (P1. 57) are derived from the few local plants). CEPHALOZIA LACINULATA (Jack) Spruce Pls. 56:5-6; 57:1-4 Occurring, largely in the Spruce-Fir Panclimax, in both Europe and North America. Apparently very rare wherever found. The species is strictly limited in occurrence to rot- ting wood: where it occurs in small green or whitish-green patches, or (most often) as creeping isolated plants among other Hepaticae. In one Minnesota locality (Itasca Park) it was found associated with Riccardia latifrons and other Cephalozia species, and Lopho- zia incisa. At the second station (Encampment R.) it occurred fruiting, among Cepha- lozia catenulata and macounii, Odontoschisma denudatum, Nowellia, Anastrophyllum michauxii and hellerianum and Jamesoniella. The species is limited to shaded moist forests. It has been reported from North America but once before (from near Newberry, Luce Co., Michigan). Although very minute and easily overlooked, this species is easily determinable in the laboratory, even when sterile. The size of the plant is scarcely as large as Cephalozia media or our other common species, but approaches that of C. leucantha and macounii in size. It also approaches the latter two species in the leaf-form (more or less ovate, longer than wide, and not decurrent (P1. 56:5-6). It differs from the ovate-leaved species of Cephalozia (except forms of C. bicuspidata and lammersiana) in the very large size of the thin-walled, hyaline cells, which are mostly 40-50 ,u in length ancf usually from 30- 40 A wide. The leaves, unlike the latter two species, are composed of few cells (15-20, occasionally 22 cells), and are only 4-7 cells wide, with the lobes at base only 1-2 cells wide (P1. 56:5-6). The very attenuate, non-connivent lobes, mostly 2-4 times as long as wide, and the rather narrow sinus, extending for half or more the length of the leaf, are also very characteristic. When fertile, the fact that male and female inflorescences occur on separate plants (and often in separate patches), the 2-3-lobed female bracts (P1. 57:1-2, 4), and longly ciliate perianth mouth (P1. 57:3) are quite characteristic.

P1. 58:1-3 Widespread in the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, more rare in the northern edge of the Deciduous Region; disappearing in the southern half of the Tundra Region. In Minne- sota confined to the Coniferous Subarctic region, and of restricted occurrence. This spe- cies, and the next differ from our other species of the genus very considerably in their ecology: they are often pioneer species on acid, seepage moistened ledges and rock-walls, where they may form thin, often brownish or even blackish mats, in strongly insolated * I have also collected the species a single time in northern Wisconsin (BAYFIELD: On decaying log in dense forest on Sand I., Apostle Isls., Lake Superior, Sept. 12-15, 1949, S 17564; among Lepidozia reptans). Mrs. Bayard R. Taylor (Mary S. Taylor), writes (Sept. 3, 1951) that she has also found C. lacinulata in Minnesota (and adjacent Ontario). Since she was the original dis- coverer of the species, for North America (see Evans, 1935), her records are undoubtedly authentic. She writes "In all stations the plants were growing on decaying logs, in com- pany with Cephalozia media, and other species of Cephalozia, Lepidozia reptans, Blepharo- stoma trichophyllum and Riccardia." Her stations follow: ONTARIO: swamp near Pigeon Bay, August 30, 1928.

C. bicuspidata apparently has no toleration for even traces of lime. It avoids decidedly calcareous areas, and in places where the pH is much above 5, it rarely or never occurs as a primary invading species. Under more acid conditions (pH 4.2-5.0) it often invades wet, rather sunny to moderately shaded ledges and cliffs, often associated with Gymnocolea (with which it forms the characteristic Gymnocolea-C. bicuspidata Asso- ciule); this associule, with the formation of a thin layer of soil, is invaded by secondary species, such as Cephalozia media, Sc. nemorosa, Lophozia kun2eana, etc. Occasionally, on wet rocks around pools, the present associule occurs next to the less oxylophyte Sc. degenii-Leiocalea Associule that frequents elevated tussocks, where the pH is from 5.5-7.0. The species also may occur on decaying logs, though such occurrences, in my experience, are decidedly unusual. This species (and the next) occupy an isolated position in the genus. They are often more or less golden-brownish tinged (though whitish-green in less exposed sites), unlike our other species. The leaf-cells are very large: usually 35-42 x 40 AL, often to 50 ja long, as in lacinulata, connivens and pleniceps. The latter two differ at once in the round leaves with the sinus never descending more than half the leaf length, and with the lobes more or less connivent. C. lacinulata, however, is more similar; both bicuspidata and lammersiana differ from it in that they attain a more robust size, have larger leaves, mostly over 10 cells wide medially (P1. 58:3), and have the perianth-mouth merely shortly dentate. The present species has been nearly universally confused in North America with the closely related C. lammersiana. The latter was regarded as a mere variety of bicuspidata, but it has been shown that bicuspidata has 18 chromosomes per cell, and lammersiana 27. C. bicuspidata, furthermore, has stolons, and has generally smaller cells (mostly only 38-45 ,u long), while the perianths occur uniformly on short ventral branches. In lammer- siana stolons are absent, the cells may attain 45 x 65 ,u, and the perianths usually occul on elongate, slender branches.

Spruce Distribution in North America virtually unknown, since it has been nearly universally placed under the very similar bicuspidata. The species occurs most often as a hygrophyte, in loose, pale, whitish or yellowish-green to brownish mats, and appears to be more restricted in occurrence than bicuspidata. In my experience it occurs chiefly on moist or wet, acid, moory or peaty substrata: for example, in a thin peaty layer, together with Gymnocolea inflata (as on the Susie Islands); it much more rarely occurs on decaying wood. The plant is sometimes separable from bicuspidata in the field by the larger size, whitish-green or brownish-green color, the unequally large, sharply pointed leaf-lobes, and the tendency to form loose mats. Normally the female bracts have entire lobes (while typical bicuspidata shows a tendency to have them obscurely dentate). In lammersiana the leaves of mature stems are mostly 14-16 cells wide; the cells of the leaf-middle are 40 x 60 to 45 x 70 A, with very thin walls; the perianths normally occur on long, leafy shoots (rather than on short postical shoots that lack all but 1-3 pairs of bracts, as in bicuspidata). The above differences are not too constant, and lammersiana has therefore been considered a variety of bicuspidata. However, it has been found that lammersiana nearly or quite lacks stolons, while bicuspidata has many of them. The above difference, together with the higher chromosome number of lammersiana appear to warrant a distinct species. Distribution.-COOK: Porcupine I., Susie Is., S 13606a, S 13620. (The above records, as well as all others from North America, must be regarded as tentative, since they are based on plants studied only morphologically, not cytologically. The morpho- logical differences between the present species, and C. bicuspidatd are so slight, and the chief character (cell-size) so apt to be modified by environmental differences, that deter- mination by other than cytological study is often subjective and unreliable.)</page><page sequence="252">508 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2,) CEPHALOZIA AMBIGUA Massal. This rather rare species is essentially Arctic-alpine in distribution. It is known from one site in Minnesota, and has been found by the writer at Deer Lake, Marquette Co., Michigan (Schuster, 1951) and will probably eventually be found in northeastern Minne- sota. The species has a scattered distribution ranging from Ellesmere Island and Green- land to Alaska, south to the east coast of Hudson Bay (Schuster, 1950), and southward in the mountains to Maine (Mt. Katahdin, Schuster), the White Mountains (Schuster), with an isolated occurrence at the summit of Mt. Leconte, Tennessee (Sharp). The species is almost restricted to the Alpine summits of the mountains, south of the Tundra Zone, and occurs in the Great Lakes area as a rare relict. In Michigan the species occurs around the sandy-peaty, open and sunny, moor-like margin of a small lake (Deer Lake), associated with Pellia epiphylla, Odontoschisma elongatum, Riccardia sinuata, traces of Fossombronia foveolata, Scapania irrigua and other species, associated with such bog-plants as Drosera rotundifolia and intermedia, Utricularia spp., Pogonia ophioglossoides, Xyris sp., etc. The species appears to be a pronounced oxylophyte, occurring either *on acidic rocks in the mountains, or on moory, sandy areas, under conditions identical with C. bicuspidata. The species is very closely related to C. bicuspidata, agreeing with it in the presence of stolons, the almost transversely inserted, erect to erect-spreading ovate leaves with non- connivent lobes, the tendency to develop golden-brown to fuscous secondary pigmentation of the cell-walls when insolated, the bilobed perichaetial bracts with the lobes essentially entire, and in the non-ciliate perianth-mouth. The facies of the species is identical with that of bicuspidata, and the species can be separated only with difficulty. C. ambigua differs from bicuspidata in the smaller leaf-cells (18-21 x 22-30, occasionally 35 ,u at the base of the lobes), the thick-walled cells, the generally smaller size (with the plants often filiform and slender), the frequent presence of gemmiparous erect slender shoots bearing a cluster of spherical, greenish, 1-celled gemmae, and in the crenulate perianth-mouth (setulose in bicuspidata with teeth 1-2 cells long). The local material showed all of these characteristics, but the cell-size of large, robust, fertile plants occasionally approached 20. 24 x 32-36 ,a on isolated leaves, showing intergradation to small-celled forms of bicuspi- data.* The various manuals stress that ambigua is much smaller and more filiform than bicuspidata, with the leaves usually with obtuse, short lobes. This is true only for the montane extremes of exposed sites; plants of moist, more sheltered sites (such as the present collections) have the leaves ovate, notably longer than wide, and with slender, acuminate, tapering lobes, exactly as is typical for bicuspidata. Distribution.-COOK: Little Susie I., Susie Is., S 14864. * A large series of collections of the Cephalozia bicuspidata complex are also before me, from Sand I., Apostle Isls., Bayfield Co., Wisc. (S 17593, etc.). This material comes from over the faces of moist to dry sandstone rocks. Much of it represents an extreme xeromorphic type, with golden to reddish-brown pigmentation, and thick-walled leaf-cells. These plants are almost intermediate in form between C. bicuspidata and am- bigua. Smaller, more filiform sterile shoots show leaf-cells only 18-24 g wide x 22-32 j long, and would be placed as C. ambigua. Other, mature, sterile plants have leaf-cells 24-28 x 32-34-36 .; these appear to intergrade with C. bicuspidata. The larger leaves of fertile plants, especially of sheltered, color-free extremes may have the cells 28-34 A wide x 34-38 g long, and approach typical bicuspidata. These plants, which were associated with Lophozia alpestris, Scapania curta, Sc. subalpina, seem almost impossible to place, unless the chromosome number be determined (9 in C. ambigua, 18 in bicuspidata). It is evident that the cell-size is subject to extensive variation in this complex, correlated with available moisture, insolation, and other environ- mental factors; furthermore, it appears to vary intrinsically with the maturity and size of the plants. The single Minnesota collection (S 14864) cited below may also conceivably be found to represent a mod. colorata-parvifolia-densifolia-pachyderma of C. bicuspidata. For the present, disposition as C. ambigua seems more correct.</page><page sequence="253">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 509 CEPHALOZIA LOITLESBERGERI Schiffn. P1. 58:4-7 This infrequent species occurs only in the Coniferous Zone northward to the edge of the Tundra, and is apparently restricted, in Minnesota, to the northeastern corner of the state. It appears to be nowhere a common species (though probably more frequent than has been presumed, since it has often been overlooked for the superficially identical C. connivens). Previous reports establish the species in Connecticut, north to New Hampshire and Nova Scotia, and again in Michigan and Ontario, to the west. The species has been previously reported only from peat bogs. In Minnesota it occurs on the relatively exposed, high crests of Sphagnum hummocks in peat bogs (as at the Grand Portage marl bog), as well as on the peaty, often exposed, crests of Sphagnum capping north and northwest facing cliffs (as on Porcupine, Belle Rose and Lucille Is- lands). Under both of these conditions it occurs almost constantly with a number of other Hepaticae: Cephaloziella subdentata, Mylia anomala, Calypogeia sphagnicola, Ric- cardia latrifrons. More rarely, Cephalozia pleniceps, Geocalyx graveolans, and (on cliff- crests only) Odontoschisma denudatum occur with it. Although the species is a decided oxylophyte, it may occur in marly bogs (as at Grand Portage), where Thuya is very abundant. Steere (1940) reports it as common in such Cedar Bogs. In the cell-size (28-35 ,u in leaf-middle), the distinctly decurrent leaves with connivent lobes (P1. 58:4), and in its general appearance this species approaches media. It differs from it in the autoecious inflorescence (P1. 58:7), but especially in the longly ciliate perianth-mouth and 4-5 lobed bracts (P1. 58:5-7), which appear to form a cluster of lanceolate or linear, almost hair-like or brush-like bracts at the base of the perianth. In the perianth-mouth and form of the bracts the species is identical with connivens, but it has much smaller cells than the latter species. Muller (1911) describes the species as with stolons: these do not occur in either media or connivens. Macvicar (1926), however, describes it as lacking stolons: I have seen stolons on the species but a single time. Sterile material of this species is very difficult to keep separate from media, near which it keys out (p. 502). In loitlesbergeri the leaf-lobes are almost acuminate, terminated by 2 or even 3 elongate single cells, and are strongly connivent, and occasionally even cross (P1. 58:4, 7). This is rarely the case in media (P1. 59:7-11), but in hygrophytic modi- fications approaching media fo. aquatica the leaf-lobes may be more acutely terminated by 2 single cells, and the leaf-lobes may approach a cruciate condition on some leaves. Such forms, when sterile, appear nearly impossible to identify. However, C. loitlesbergeri has normally somewhat thick-walled cells, while hygrophytic forms of media (which also have acuminate leaf-lobes) have extremely leptodermous leaf-cells.

P1. 59:7-11 Extremely widely distributed and often common, throughout most of the Deciduous Region of eastern North America, northward far into the Tundra Region. In Minnesota, restricted to the northern and eastern parts of the state, largely because of the moisture factor. C. media is one of the most common species of the genus, and occurs under a greater variety of conditions than any other species, at least in our region. It may occur on decaying logs, as a member of the Nowellia-Jamesoniella Associule, together with C. catenulata, lacinulata, macounii, Odontoschisma denudatum, Lophozia porphyroleuca and ascendens, Scapania apiculata and glaucocephala, and Blepharostoma trichophyllum, etc.* It is also common in Sphagnum bogs, where it occurs with C. connivens, pleniceps and loitlesbergeri, and with Cephaloziella elachista, Mylia, Cladopodiella, Lophozia marchica, * C. media persists on such logs until they are far decayed, and then occurs with eco- logically more "advanced" bryophytes, such as Bazzania trilobata, Tetraphis pellucida and (near the xeric extreme) Leucobryum glaucum.</page><page sequence="254">510 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) PLATE 58.

Under similar, peaty conditions it occurs under seepage-mois- tened conditions on the crests or slopes of cliffs, again with members of the Mylia Asso- ciule. More rarely the species occurs as a chasmophyte on naked soil over rocks or in rock-crevices, or occasionally on bare earth along paths and on slopes, here associated with LophoZia ventricosa and excisa, Blepharostoma, etc. Because of its abundance this species will become well-known to the student long before the other species of its genus become familiar. The strongly decurrent leaves, mostly only 7-12 cells wide in the middle, and virtually orbicular in shape, with the apex bilobed only to about 1/3 the leaf-length (and the sinus broad, oval, with the connivent lobes often nearly closing it) are quite characteristic (P1. 59:7-11). Similar leaves (but with more acuminate and connivent, often crossing lobes) occur only in loitlesbergeri (see above) and in affinis and connivens. C. media differs at once from the latter two species in the dioecious inflorescence (and from connivens in the much smaller leaf-cells, in the crenulate perianth-mouth and merely bilobed bracts). C. pleniceps, which also has a cren- ulate perianth-mouth and bilobed bracts, differs from media in the autoecious inflorescence, as well as in the larger leaf-cells, the less decurrent leaves, and little connivent lobes. Con- fusion elsewhere is possible only with catenulata, which is confined to decaying logs (at least in our region), and has non-decurrent quadrate leaves with non-connivent lobes; it furthermore has smaller cells only 15-18 A in diameter, that are thick-walled; the mature leaves are also wider, mostly 11-14 cells wide in the middle. The extremely rare C. affinis appears inseparable from media when sterile. When fertile the monoecious inflorescence distinguishes it. This species and C. macrostachya also appear closely related, as Miiller (1916, p. 776) and Meylan (1924, p. 213) point out. Miiller notes that C. media occurs as hygric modifications, in bogs, which cannot be separated sharply from macrostachya, and which are quite inseparable from macrostachya when sterile. C. loitlesbergeri (as noted under that species) also can scarcely be kept separate from hygrophytic modifications of nmedia, when sterile. In a single collection before me, from Porcupine Island, Susie Islands, August 12, 1948 (Schuster 13987), bearing both perianths and (on separate plants), male inflores- cences, we appear to have a form of media that so closely approaches macrostachya that any sharp separation appears impossible. These plants have most leaf-lobes straight, ter- minated by 1 elongate or a row of 2 cells; the sinuses are mostly narrow, 1/3 - 1/2 the leaf length in depth. The dorsal cortical stem cells are 36-40 x 55-80 P, (in media 25 x 35 A, fide Miller). The perichaetial bracts are bilobed, with the lobes obscurely dentate to moderately dentate; the perianth-mouth is denticulate- with teeth 1-2 cells long, at times 3 cells long. Such plants depart far from the normal forms found in media, but appear still closer to media because: 1. The female bracts are more weakly dentate on their margins. 2. The perianth-mouth is not ciliate at mouth. 3. The androecia are small, poorly developed. 4. Robust female plants of macrostachya have the leaves mostly 14-16 (P1. 60:6), occasionally up to 20-25 cells wide.

P1. 60:1-5 This rare species has been previously reported (in North America) only from Califor- nia and Washington: i.e., along the west coast. In Minnesota a single collection of posi- tively identified plants, is before me, from the northeastern tip of the state. The occurrence in this area of other far-western species is of interest (Crataegus douglasii, Woodsia sco- pulina, oregana, etc.), and it is possible that the Cephalozia may be regarded as a "Cor- dilleran relict"-in spite of the fact that its present site was submerged after the last glaciation. The species occurred with Sphagnum and Lepidozia reptans, and a little Anastrophyl- lum michauxii in thin, peaty mats over shaded ledges and cliffs in a dense, humid, Thuya-Picea forest. This species can be confused only with Cephalozia media and pleniceps. It agrees with the first in the relatively small leaf-cells (28-35 ,u in leaf-middle, averaging about 30 iL, in the lobes averaging as little as 20-25 A), in the very distinctly decurrent leaves (P1. 60,:2), and in the total lack of stolons. In all of these characters it differs from C. pleniceps, which has the perianths 2-3 stratose to the middle or higher, the leaf-cells 35-45 iu or even larger, the leaves scarcely decurrent, and is often provided with stolons. C. aunis, however, is, monoecious (P1. 60:3) as is pleniceps (in contrast to the dioecious media). Sterile plants are likely to be confused with C. media, while the monoecious fertile plants are most apt to be confused with C. pleniceps. This confusion is due essen- tially to the similar facies all three species have: they all agree in the small, slender spicate androecia, generally occurring on short postical branches (P1. 60:3); in the crenu- late-dentate perianth-mouth (P1. 60:1); in the obtusely to subacutely bilobed perichaetial bracts (P1. 60:5); in the shallowly (2/5 or less) bilobed leaves with mostly slightly to distinctly connivent, broad, and obtuse to subacute lobes (P1. 60:2). The species may be related more to pleniceps than to media, and is very apt to be mistaken for it. In addi- tion to the smaller leaf-cells (20-24 ,u wide in the lobes, vs. 30-36 AL in pleniceps), affinis also has much smaller stem cells. In the collection at hand they varied from 35-40 AL wide x 42-80 ju long (versus 48-56 x 64-100 ji in pleniceps). The status of C. affinis as a species must remain in doubt. The chief difference lies in the autoecious inflorescence of affinis (versus the dioecious inflorescences of mediaz) According to Muller the leaf-cells are also slightly larger in affinis (30-40 U. vs. 25-35 AL for media), and the leaves are merely bilobed 1/4, rarely to 1/3 (1 /3 in media), Finally, the perianth-mouth of affinis is said to be somewhat more strongly dentate, with some of the lobes provided with teeth 2-3 cells long (P1. 60 1 ). In the material at hand the leaf-cells (as noted above) were considerably smaller than given for afinis, and as is evident from the figures (P1. 60:2), the leaves are bilobed 1/3 or even somewhat deeper (with the lobes not as uniformly connivent as is commonly the case in media); finally, the perianth-mouth lobes are partly dentate with teeth merely 1-2 cells long. In media the perianths are 2, locally 3 cell-layers thick near the base, in afinis supposedly 1-layered to the base. In local plants tlhe basal third of mature perianths are mostly 2, locally 3 cell-layers thick, but most somewhat immature perianths are unistratose to the base (P1. 60:4). For these reasons 't may seem desirable to consider afijnis merely a variety of media. Miiller and MacviLar, for instance, separate the frequently monoecious C. spiniflora Schiffn. as a mere variety from the dioecious C. macrostachya. It should also be noted that in the local material referred to afinis, a monoecious inflorescence could not be ascer- tained in all plants: many showed intermingled androecia and perianths, but no living connection between them could be found.

P1. 60:10 Distributed throughout the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, and to a lesser degree in the northern edge of the Deciduous Region. In Minnesota apparently confined to the north- eastern third of the state. The species has a much more restricted distribution locally than most other species of Cephalo2ia of our region: it occurs on shaded, moist, decaying logs, in dense forests and is most often confined to the very shaded north or northwest facing lateral faces of such logs, where direct sunlight never hits. It occurs here with Cephalozia macounii, occasionally media, lacinulata, or other species, and with Jamesoniella, Odonto- schisma denudatum, Anastrophyllum michauxii, A. hellerianum, Cephaloziella rubella var. sullivantii, and Nowellia, i.e., with other members of the Nowellia-Jamesoniella Associule. This is one of the very easy species of the genus to recognize, even on the basis of sterile material: the leaves are approximate and (as the name implies) very regularly inserted in a chain-like fashion; large mature leaves are 10-15 cells wide or more, with the cells unusually small (mostly 16-18, occasional ones to 21 ,) and thick-walled (P1. 60:10). Similarly small-celled leaves occur only in leucantha and macounii; these species, however, have more ovate leaves only 6-9 cells wide, that are inserted more nearly trans- versely. In catenulata the mature leaf is almost quadrate, non-decurrent, almost horizontal- ly inserted, and has non-connivent lobes (P1. 60:10). When fertile (and this often the case), the coarsely dentate female bracts are very characteristic: such bracts do not occur in any other local species. The perianth-mouth has long cilia (as in loitlesbergeri, but unlike media). Juvenile plants are apt to be mistaken for C. macounii (which see for separation), because of the decidedly oval shape of the leaves of such plants, with narrow, acuminate leaf-lobes.

P1. 59:1-6 Widely distributed throughout the Subarctic-subalpine Region, with a few relict locali- ties southward in the northern edge of the Deciduous Region. In Minnesota occurring apparently throughout the Coniferous Zone, and occasionally in isolated bogs south of that zone. The species, in Minnesota at least, is virtually confined to bogs and swamps, where it usually invades later than the Mylia-Cladopodiella Associule, occurring only after the Chameadaphne Heath has become quite dense, and after Spruce and Fir (or Thuya) have started to come in. The association with various species of Sphagnum and with Drosera rotundifolia is quite constant, however. Occasionally the species occurs on moist peaty-covered cliffs, where it may occur with other 'Cephalozia species (leucantha, media, lammersiana), and with Mylia, Odontoschisma denudatum, etc. Although the species has been reported from wet decaying logs, I have never seen it from such sites, except when the logs occur in swamps or bogs. The species as a whole can be rather easily recognized. Most characteristic are the very large leaves, 12-16, occasionally to 25 cells wide in the middle (P1. 59:6), with the leaf-form nearly orbicular, and with the base indistinctly decurrent (P1. 59:1-2); the leaf-lobes are broad, 8-9 cells wide at base and not or little connivent (P1. 59:6). The rather large leaf-cells (30 x 45 A; or larger) are also characteristic. The species is almost always fertile, and an autoecious inflorescence can usually be easily demonstrated (P1. 59:4). The crenulate perianth-mouth (P1. 59:3) and the relatively firm and fleshy perianth (which is 2-3 cells thick to the middle) are very important diagnostic characters, together with the mostly bilobed bracts. The lobes of the latter are broad and often more or less obtuse, and entire. The material occurring under mesic conditions on peaty soil or on cliffs has smaller cells (not over 30 x 45 ,L), and has very short female branches, as well as numerous stolons. Such material is considered to be typical pleniceps, and is relatively infrequent in our region.</page><page sequence="260">516 TIlE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) The plants occurring in the wetter parts of peat bogs, together with C. connivens and Mylia, etc., are called var. macrantha (Kaal. &amp; Nichols.) K. M. These are characterized by larger leaf-cells, 40 x 50 ,u or even larger, by generally more distant, more horizontal leaves, and by the often elongate female branches. In my experience such material com- pletely lacks stolons normally. According to Miiller the leaves of this variety are only 12- 13 cells wide, but in material from the eastern United States they are often, as in typical pleniceps, 18-20 or more cells wide. The disposition of this form is difficult. It is obvi- ously analogous to C. lammersiana, and differs from typical pleniceps in exactly the same way as lammersiana differs from bicuspidata: larger leaf-cells, more elongate female branches (P1. 59:4), and virtual or complete lack of stolons. It is possible, therefore, that this bog form may represent a discrete species (as was assumed by Kaalaas and Nicholson in 1911, when they described it as a species).

CEPHALOZIA CONNIVENS (Dicks.) Spruce P1. 61:1-8 Frequent to common throughout the Subarctic-subalpine Region, becoming rare in the northern half of the Deciduous Region, and absent or nearly in the upper Tundra Region. Jn Minnesota occurring in the northeastern half of the state only, and quite rare south of the Coniferous Region. The species occurs almost exclusively in wet acid bogs, where it is one of the early members of the Mylia-Cladopodiella Associule to invade. More rarely the species occurs in marl bogs, associated with such rare species as Riccardia pinguis and A?Joerkia hibernica. The immediately underlying substrate, however, is always acid, even though the species has a relatively high tolerance for Ca. Under all conditions a hygro- phyte or meso-hygrophyte, and without exception on a substrate high in organic materials. In bogs occasionally undergoing ecesis on decaying shaded logs, where it may occur with Odontoschisma denudatum and Cephalozia pleniceps, etc. The restricted occurrence of the species will aid in its identification. It is easily recog- nized, even in the field under the hand-lens, by the obliquely inserted, nearly orbicular, strongly decurrent leaves (P1. 61:1), with the lobes strongly connivent (the sinus thus. almost circular or oval, and closed or nearly). Under the microscope the very large leaf- cells (45-60 js in leaf-middle), and the relatively few cells of which the leaf is composed (the leaves only 7-12 cells wide, lobes mostly only 3-5 cells wide at base; entire leaf of only 35-40 cells) are diagnostic. The plant lacks all trace of stolons and is usually fer- tile. The autoecious inflorescence is easily evident: androecia and perianths occurring in close proximity. Very characteristic is the longly ciliate perianth-mouth (P1. 61:2, 5) and the deeply 3-5-lobed bracts, which have narrowly lanceolate lobes (P1. 61:2, 6-8).* * The very large size of the leaf-cells may lead to confusion between juvenile plants of this species, and mature plants of C. lacinulata. Mature sterile plants of C. connivens always differ by the broader leaves, with the leaf-lobes 3-5 cells wide (rather than 2 cells wide).</page><page sequence="261">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 517 Distribution.-ANOKA/IsANTI: Cedar Creek, S 14076, S 14069a, pH 3.6, S 14064, pH 3.9, S 14063, pH 4.0, S 14060.

This rare species has a similar distribution, apparently, as C. connivens, occurring generally in the open parts of Sphagnum bogs. It has been reported but twice from North America (Worcester, Mass. and Cheboygan Co., Mich.), and a few stations in Minne- sota extend its range westward to the new limital point in its known distribution. C. compacta is generally a bog species, and at its Minnesota stations occurs with such other bog Hepaticae as Cephaloziella elachista, Mylia anomala, Cephalozia pleniceps, and with typical C. connivens. The species is extremely close to C. connivens, and sometimes given merely the rank of a variety, C. connivens var. compacta (Wtsf.) Nicholson. Since it is so close to that species, it has probably been repeatedly overlooked as the common C. connivens, and possibly some of the reports of C. connivens in this work may refer to compacta. When sterile there is no certain way of distinguishing com pacta from connivens: both species share large- thin-walled leaf-cells (40-50 , or even larger in the leaf-middle, generally), leaves that are mostly 8-11 cells wide, and that are strongly decurrent and have very obvi- ously connivent lobes (the sinuses thus often nearly circular and almost or quite closed). Both species are monoecious, and the perianths are ciliate at the mouth in both cases. In compacta, unlike connivens, the involucral bracts are mostly 2-3-lobed, and armed at the margins with several sharp, spinous to ciliate teeth or small lobes; the major lobes are rather broadly triangular and generally 7-8 cells wide at base. Furthermore, the perianth- mouth of compacta is fringed with shorter cilia, mostly 2-3 cells long, only relatively few being 4-6 cells long. Students have also cited differences in size of the leaf-cells, compacta supposedly having smaller cells than connivens. Jensen, however, has stressed that no constant difference occurs in this regard, and in the local collection this is amply borne out: some leaves have the median cells only 38-45 ,xt, and isodiametric; others have them 45-50 x 50-60 A in size. Plants with small-celled leaves are likely to be confused with C. loitlesbergeri, while large-celled plants are exceedingly like C. connivens. The form of the female bracts of compacta will separate it from both loitlesbergeri and connivens. Distribution.-KoOCHICHING: Bog at Black Bay, near Island View, Rainy Lake, S 14649, S 14642a. ST.

'CLADOPODIELLA Buch CLADOPODIELLA FLUITANS (Nees) Buch P1. 61:9-10 This species occurs in our area only in the Coniferous Forest Region; further east it occurs also in the isolated "islands" of that type of forest that occurs around the margins of bogs in the northern part of the Deciduous Region. In Minnesota the species is rela- tively rare. It is confined to bogs in distribution: and is restricted to wet bogs, in which the sphagnum-sedge mat has so densely covered the underlying soils that little or no trace of lime penetrates through. The species is a decided "calciphobe," with a pH preferen- dum of about 3.6-4.8. In bogs it is most frequent around the edges of paths made by deer, etc., which the Ledum-Chameadaphne Heath does not completely shade. Here it is may be subaquatic, or on the saturated slopes of the Sphagnum hummocks, associated with Mylia anomala, Calypogeia sphagnicola, Cephaloziella elachista, and Lophozia marchica and capitata. In Minnesota it is, however, much less frequent than any of the latter species.</page><page sequence="262">518 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 5. 6 4 d27~~~~~~ 9. . i30 o ~~~14. I0. PLATE 61.

Only one other species has similar bilobed leaves with the lobes rounded or obtuse: Gym- nocolea inflata. The presence of ventral stolons and ventrally originating stems will separate it from Gymnocolea (P1. 61:9), as well as the rather large underleaves (P1. 61:10). The latter, furthermore, occurs in our area almost exclusively on wet ledges or cliffs. Lophbo zia (Orthocaulis) kunz.eana occasionally occurs among Sphagnum (as at Grand Marais), and attenuate forms may have distant leaves very similar in appearance to those of Clado- podiella. However, Cladopodiella has larger cells (about 35-42 A; in the Orthocaulis about 18-25 ,u), has flagellae, and has all of the leaves bilobed (in Orthocaulis some of them are always trilobed).

NOWELLIA Mitten This genus contains only the following, very distinctive species in North America. The species occurs only on rotting wood, and differs from other forms at once in the peculiar form and insertion of the leaves. NOWELLIA CURVIFOLIA (Dicks.) Mitt. P1. 61:11-14 This species is widely distributed throughout much of the Deciduous Forest and Coniferous Biome. In Minnesota it is virtually limited to the Coniferous forest region. Here it occurs on decaying, decorticated, rather exposed to shaded logs.* It is associated frequently in a distinct associule with the following species: Anastrophyllum michauxii and hellerianum, Scapania apiculata, S. glaucocephala, Blepharostoma trichophyllum, Lophozia porphyroleuca and ascendens, various Cephalozia species (especially catenulata), and Jamesoniella autumnalis and Lophocolea heterophylla, Lepidozia reptans. It "prefers" a pH range of about 4.5-5.6. Under very shaded conditions it is pure green, but nor- mally is at least somewhat reddish-brown in color. The species can be recognized in the field by its facies alone, after it has once been correctly identified. The peculiar leaves are transversely inserted and have the line of insertion very short, because of the extremely constricted basal portion of the leaf (PI. 61:11, 14); the distal half of the leaf is bilobed, with each lobe running out in a long cilium consisting of a single row of cells (P1. 61:13); the lower margins of the leaves are inflexed, forming a sort of water-sac (P1. 61:11). The species very generally has a red- dish-purple pigmentation, though it may be pure green (under unusually shaded condi- tions). The strongly inflated leaves (looking like miniature, billowing sails), the color, and the often present sharply trigonous perianths are distinctive. The plants occasionally bear small masses of 1-celled, oval, thick-walled, colorless gemmae; these are scarce and almost invariably overlooked. There is no species with which it is likely to be confused. Distribution.-CARLTON: Albert, C 222; Carlton, C 679. CLEARWATER: Floating Bog, Itasca Park, S 14890.

Family ODONTOSCHISMACEAE This family is very closely related to the Cephaloziaceae, and shares with the family the following fundamental characters: perianth trigonous, on short ventral branches (P1. 62:5); spore: elater ratio approximately 1:1; capsule- wall bistratose, the inner layer with annular, the outer with nodular thicken- ings; seta of sporophyte of 4 inner, 8 outer rows of cells; rhizoids scattered over postical stem surface; androecial branches short, spicate, postical, terminal; gemmae ovoid, greenish, smooth, postical; leafless flagellae generally present (P1. 62:3). In spite of these similarities, there are certain differences that are funda- mental. The regional species of this family have unlobed leaves (P1. 62:1, 3); the leaf-cells are strongly collenchymatous, with often very strongly bulging trigones (P1. 62:2, 9-10), and do not develop equally thickened walls; the oil-bodies occur 1-4 or 5 per cell, and are ovoid or elliptical, and extremely large (P1. 62:2, 9-10). Finally, the underleaves are generally quite distinct and are provided (at least near the shoot-tips) with numerous slime papillae (P1. 62:6-7). Only a single genus occurs in North America. ODONTOSCHISMA Dumort. Two species of this genus occur along the easternmost edge of the state, only one of which has been previously reported from the state (anid that from a single locality). The species of the genus may be possibly confused with other Hepaticae with round, entire leaves (such as gemmae-free forms of Mylia anomala, and with Solenostoma), but differ at once from all other local Hepaticae with entire leaves in possessing stolons (P1. 62:3). Other charac- teristics that serve to identify the genus are the prismatic, trigonous perianths (occurring on short postical shoots) (P1. 62:5); the large, usually bulging, trigones of the leaves (Pl. 62:10); and the very large oil-bodies (P1. 62:2), which occur only 1-4 per cell. Usually characteristic, ascending or erect gemmae-bearing, flagellae-like branches occur in abundance (Pl. 62:1, 8). Our species may be identified by the following key*: * 0. prostrdtum was reported by Conard (1945) from Linn Co., Iowa. I have exam- amined the specimen, which is fragmentary, and find it to represent Plectocolea crenulata. The species does not, apparently, occur anywhere in the Upper Midwest. The report of this species further to the west, in Wyoming, by Clark and Frye (The Bryologist 40:13- 16, 1937) is also based on a misdetermination of a species of Plectocolea (Jungerman- niaceae) according to A. L. Andrews (personal communication). It is therefore very doubtful whether the species occurs anywhere this far north and west.</page><page sequence="265">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 521 KEY TO SPECIES 1.

P1. 62:1-3 Widely distributed throughout most of the Coniferous Region, southward well into the Subtropical Regions; northward extending slightly or not at all into the Tundra Region: thus of doubtful occurrence in the Arctic-alpine Region. The species is limited in occur- rence to the eastern United States and Canada, in North America, and has been pre- viously found west only to Wisconsin and Louisiana. In Minnesota the species is limited to the eastern edge of the state and appears to be of very restricted occurrence, possibly because of the unfavorable moisture-conditions in the region approaching the Prairie. Unlike our other two species of the genus, 0. denudatum occurs virtually entirely on decaying logs, or on the peaty detritus formed by them, or over peat on Sphagnum- covered cliffs (as on Susie Islands); occasionally (as at Great Palisade), it occurs on peaty acid soil over talus below cliffs. The species is a mesophyte or mesoxerophyte, has a preference for low pH conditions, and appears totally unable to compete under even slightly calcareous conditions. It is found on decaying logs chiefly on the exposed, sunny upper portions, associated with such species of the Jamesoniella-Nowellia Associule as Lophozia porphyroleuca, Nowellia curvifolia, Jamesoniella autumnalis, occasionally when on more shaded logs with Cephalozia pleniceps or media or catenulata, Anastrophyllum niichauxii, A. hellerianum, Calypogeia meylanii. On peaty banks it is found with some of the above species (A. michauxii, Jamesoniella, Lophozia ventricosa and porphyroleuca, Cephalozia media, etc.), as well as with Bazzania trilobata, L. attenuata, Lepidozia and Blepharostoma, in a peat-bank Associule. Although the material occurring on decaying logs is easily separable from our other two species, the collections from peaty banks are very difficult to place. Typically the species shows dense, numerous surface-papillae on the leaves (some up to 4 x 8 Ab in size), often occurring very crowded; in material from the Great Palisade, however, there was virtually no development of surface papillae, although occasional low ones occurred. The species on logs is either green (where shaded) or reddish-brown (but the material from Great Palisade is quite greenish-brown). The material from the Susie Islands represents an extreme form of denudatum. It has the cuticle nearly or quite smooth, the plants are basically a whitish-green, but in the sun become strongly reddish-brown pigmented, rarely with a beautiful violet-purple sheen, with the trigones of the leaves becoming extremely large and salient (P1. 62:10; Fig. 6:7), while the leaves themselves become quite concave, approaching those of macounii in form; associated with these xeromorphic features, we find that the gemmiparous shoots (which * See previous footnote.</page><page sequence="266">522 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 4. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ( 3 PLATE 62.

These plants also differ from typical denudatum in that the shoot-apices never become flagelliferous and rhizoidous: a feature which is quite characteristic of 0. denudatum, but the flagellae are strictly postical (i.e., never terminal) in origin. It was at first felt that the form occurring so abundantly on the Susie Islands repre- sented an extreme form of denudatum, intergrading to elongatum. This does not appear to be the case. Significantly, no epixylic material of denudatum is known from the Susie Island area-in spite of the fact that numerous decaying moist logs are available for ecesis, and that the 0. denudatum is extraordinarily abundant on peaty wet banks. The writer is therefore convinced that the peat-inhabiting populations of denudatum represent a genetically discrete variety, unable to undergo ecesis on decaying logs. These peat- inhabiting types with a smooth cuticle are here separated as the variety laevissima. It is possible they represent a discrete ecospecies. Odontoschisma denudatum var. laevissima var. nova* P1. 62:7, 8, 10 With an extremely restricted occurrence in our region: confined to the northeastern tip of Cook County, restricted essentially to the Arctic-alpine strip. On the Susie Islands cften occurring in the vicinity of 0. macounii, but only rarely mixed with it (as on Belle Rose Island). Considering the fundamentally different ecological characteristics of the two species, it is not surprising that they occur intermingled in nature only very exception- ally. 0. denudatum var. laevissima, unlike macounii, is an extreme "calciphobe" (oxylo- phyte), occurring under a pH of 3.6 to 4.2 (eight tests, with a mean of 3.8), at the lower edges of the peaty crests of vegetation that cap cliffs. The variety occurs here only in wet, constantly moistened narrow zones, below the more xeric Bazzania-Lepidozia- Dicranum Zone of the crests, and usually in a more mesic Mylia anomala-Calypogeta sphagnicola-Zone. It occurs especially with My/ia anomala, more occasionally Lophozia incisa, Cephalozia spp. (leucantha, media, bicuspidata), LophoZia ventricosa and silvicola (mod. colorata-pachyderma), L. attenuata, etc. All of the collections I have made were either fringed by Sphagnum above, or growing directly over Sphagnum. The variety may grow within a few feet of 0. macounii, but apparently almost never together: macounii apparently being unable to tolerate such acid, peaty sites. The variety differs at once from macounii in the less imbricate and less concave leaves (P1. 62:8), but especially in the usually reddish-brown or even purplish-black pigmenta- tion.f Extreme forms are difficult to separate from denudatum. The local material is somewhat more robust than typical denudatum, but agrees with it in possession of numer- ous flagelliform, erect shoots bearing gemmae (P1. 62:8).

ODONTOSCHISMA ELONGATUM (Lindb.) Evs. This high subarctic and Arctic-alpine species has not yet been found in Minnesota, but Evans (1912) reports it from the Ontario shore of Lake Superior. The writer has also recently found the species in northern Michigan (Deer Lake, Baraga Co.): therefore * Cuticula laevis; folia valde concave; cellulae valde crassatae in angulis. t Under some conditions the plants acquire a violaceous to purplish, almost metallic sheen, which together with the almost red color of the plants, gives them a very spectacu- lar appearance.</page><page sequence="268">524 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) the species should eventually be found in Minnesota. Elsewhere in North America it is known only from Greenland, Maine and New Hampshire. The ecological requirements of 0. elongatum closely approach those of 0. denudatum var. laevissima: the species is an extreme oxylophyte, occurring on peaty, strongly insolated sites. Unlike 0. denudatum var. laevissima, the present species very generally is found around the sandy-peaty moors of lakes or ponds, associated with such oxylophytes as Pellia epiphylla, Scapania irrigua and paludicola, Fossombronia foveolata, Cephalozia ambigua (or bicuspidata), and the vascular species, Drosera rotundifolia and intermedia, Pogonia ophioglossoides, Utricularia spp., Myrica gale, Xyris sp., Ledum, and various sedges (a site at which it was common at the single Michigan locality). 0. elongatum differs from our other species of Odontoschisma in several regards (in addition to the obvious differences in ecological requirements). It has a pronounced ten- dency to become brownish or fuscous to blackish-brown in color: never showing any reddish-brown pigmentation: it has the leaves little or scarcely imbricate and usually spreading laterally: it rarely produces gemmiparous shoots; the shoot-apices never become flagelliferous; the underleaves are often moderately large and densely covered with slime- papillae (though often scarcely larger than in denudatum). These features give the species a distinctive facies that usually separates it at once from both denudatum and macounii: neither of which ever shows any tendency towards a brownish or fuscous pig- mentation. Finally, 0. elongatum has the cuticle quite smooth (unlike most denudatum), and has the middle-lamella between the cells unusually prominent. In 0. denudatum and macounii the middle lamella is extremely inconspicuous or impossible to resolve (except occasionally under the oil-immersion lens). The sharply discrete middle lamella, there- fore, serves as an important separating character of the species, allowing its separation at a glance from denudatum. The trigones in elongatum vary greatly in the degree of devel- opment, though they are usually at least slightly bulging; under extremely insolated condi- tions they approach those of macounii in size. Since they range from a denudatum extreme to a macounii extreme, their size seems to be useless as a separating feature. Distribution.-In the Lake Superior region known only from the north shore of Lake Superior (near Otter Head, Thunder Bay Distr., Ontario; admixed with type of 0. ma- counii, fide Evans (1912); the profound ecological differences between 0. elongatum and 0. macounii suggest an error in either determination, or admixture of material from eco- logically different sites); from Deer Lake, near Munising, Baraga Co., Michigan, S 16115 (among Cephalozia near ambigua, Scapania subalpina, S. irrigua, Sphagnum), S 16103 (among Cephalozia ambigua?, Pellia epiphylla, Scapania irrigua). ODONTOSCHISMA MACOUNII (Aust.) Evs. P1. 62:4-6, 9 This species is essentially Arctic-alpine, but has a limited distribution in our area along the shores of Lake Superior; it appears to be confined strictly to these, and I have never found it more than 25 feet from the lake. The species occurs under a relatively limited variety of conditions: it occurs under fairly exposed conditions, on the north and northwest facing, relatively sheltered, cold and shaded sides of small islands. Here it may occur as a chasmophyte, or may occur in large, dense mats, capping the crest of low cliffs and ledges. Under the latter conditions it may form large, pure mats, easily recognizable by their pure, rather pale green color. Such mats may form the matrix in which Empetrum nigrum and Selaginella selaginoides: two decidedly boreal species grow (as on Big Susie Island). The species is able to toler- ate a rather large quantity of sun, if conditions are not too dry; it is essentially a meso- phyte but may occur under somewhat xeric conditions, if sheltered. It is occasional around rocky pools that are in the full sun for most of the day, but there occurs under mesic- hygric conditions, associated with the Scirpus caespitosus Associule, with such species as Selaginella selaginoides, Scapania degenii, L. (Leiocolea) heterocolpa, L. (Leiocolea) gillmani, more occasionally with Plagiochila asplenioides and Tritomaria quinquedentata, Scapania mucronata, Lophozia grandiretis, and Ptilidium ciliare. Occurrences with the</page><page sequence="269">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 525 latter four species are exceptional, and here neither the Odontoschisma nor the associated species occur as well-developed normal forms. In the Scirpus caespitosus rock-pool Associule the species may be found as a matrix beneath Primulla intercedens,, Pr. misstassinica, and Pinguicula vulgaris. In crevices and on the upper crests of moist ledges the species may occur in pure mats and form a matrix for these herbs. In crevices, at times, it is associated with the calciphyte, Potentilla fruticosa. Significantly, all of the occurrences noted above, are with species that are either decided calciphytes or are very lime tolerant. Sixteen separate mats were tested, under a wide variety of conditions, as regards the pH. This was found to vary from 7.0 to an exceptional, low extreme of 4.7. The species obviously occurred merely as a relic under the latter conditions and was scarcely typical. Omitting the latter atypical pH readings the range was between 5.5 and 7.0. The species, typically, can be easily told from denudatum, which may grow within a few feet of it (under considerably different conditions). The leaves are not spreading, are strongly imbricate, more strongly concave than in denudatum (P1. 62:4-5). The plants are always a pure, usually rather transparent green, appearing transparent because of lie enormous hyaline trigones (P1. 62:9) .* This species is much more variable, in some respects, than assumed by Evans (1903), in other respects it is much less variable than assumed by the latter author. Evans assumed the brownish pigmented forms of Odontoschisma, found with the green (more typical) material, to belong to 0. macounii. Later (1912) he placed these brown pig- mented forms with the rather distantly related 0. elongatum. Subsequent experience with 0. macounii has not revealed any ability on the part of that species to form secondary pigmentation of the cell-walls. I have studied it, in the living state, in a variety of locali- ties, varying from hygric to decidedly xeric, from extremely exposed to quite shaded, and have never seen any tendency towards the production of pigmentation under any condition. Indeed, the total lack of ability of the species to produce pigmented forms at once iso- lates it from all other nearctic species of the genus. On the other hand, the species varies more than assumed by Evans (1903) in three respects, namely a) the degree of development of the trigones; b) the leaf-form and degree to which the leaves are concave; c) the size of the underleaves. Firstly, much material from the Lake Superior shore of Minnesota shows only moderately bulging trigones, no larger than those of 0. denudatum forms. The chess-board like arrangement of cells and trigones, with rounded-quadrate trigones virtually as large as the cell-lumina, occurs in some forms, even in hygric material. In other forms, from shaded, but dry sites, the cell-lumen is 4-8 times the size of the neighboring trigones. It is thus evident that Evans laid too much stress on the trigone-size in attempting to separate this species from others of its genus. Secondly, the leaf-shape and concavity are extraordinarily variable in this species. Normally, as figured and described by Evans (1903) the leaves of this species are very strongly concave (spoon-shaped), and more or less imbricate; they then exhibit no tendency towards the formation of bilobed leaves. However, forms occur, from unduly acid, moist sites, in which the leaves are distant to approximate, spread somewhat later- ally (though still suberect), are only moderately concave, and are most frequently shallow- ly bilobed with a sinus that is crescentic, and descends for perhaps 1/12 - 1/8 the leaf- * Most manuals stress the fact that macounii has larger trigones than denudatum. The cell-net of macounii is said to simulate a checker-board, with the trigones quadrangu- lar and as large as the cell-cavities. This is not or rarely the case in Minnesota material, in which the trigones are normally as in P1. 62:9. As is evident on comparison with P1. 62:10, 0. denudatum may have larger trigones than macounii. The very large underleaves of macounii are also stressed as a species character; in the Minnesota plants these again are relatively poorly developed (less than in P1. 62:4 and 6). It is possible that in more Arctic areas there is a tendency for the underleaves to become larger and to develop more abundant slime papillae.</page><page sequence="270">526 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) length; the leaf-lobes are broadly obtuse, but obtusely apiculate in some cases.* Thirdly, the underleaves of much material are very poorly developed, and only little or no larger than in the 0. denudatum-elongatum complex: e.g., 2-4 cells wide x 4-6 cells long. Evans (1903) had already noted that in the Minnesota material seen by him the under- leaves were smaller than from the more typical, more nearly Artcic sites the species occurs in most usually. The plants from Grand Marais (Schuster, 19468a) with largely retuse to bilobed leaves are of such unusual interest that they warrant further study. The plants super- ficially look very much like a small form (mod. viridis) of Lophozia wenzelii, showing the same concave leaves, and very shallowly lobed leaves. However, many leaf-lobes are not only widely obtuse, but are rounded, only a few ending in a sharp point. Further- more, the ventral branches and constant presence of ventral stolons, as well as the large trigones of the leaves, and the 3-4 oil-bodies per cell, all typify Odontoschisma. In addi- tion, discrete underleaves occur.

Suborder PTILIDIINAE Schuster The members of this suborder may be diagnosed briefly as follows: leafy plants, with leaves generally incubously shingled (Pls. 64:6, 9; 65:2, 6, 9) (more rarely transverset); the lateral leaves are almost always 3-4 lobed or toothed (Pls. 63:2, 3; 64:1, 3, 5-9) and may be margined with cilia (P1. 63:1, 5, 8-9); only in some species of Calypogeia do they become entire; the ventral lobe is never in the form of a lobule. There are always very large and obvious underleaves retained: which are usually lobed and margined like the lateral leaves (Pls. 63:4; 64:4, 6, 8; 65:12); the rhizoids, when present, are restricted to a sharply defined field at the base of these underleaves (Pl. 65:6). As in the previous suborder, there is gradual evolution in this suborder * My only collection of this type is of a small tuft of plants, growing under anoma- lous conditions: between Sphagnum, together with such oxylophytes as Polytrichum com- mune, Lophozia k.unzeana, as well as such basiphytes as Scapania irrigua, and such often basiphilous plants as Cephaloziella hampeana. The site, in peaty crevices of basalt ledges, near the shore, The Point, Grand Marais (S 19468a) is typical of many basiphytes, with succession in crevices, subsequent to the accumulation of organic materials, towards more oxylophyte communities. The present niche undoubtedly represents an extremely advanced one for the Odontoschisma and Scapania to have persisted in, the plants of these two species are rare, and evidently being succeeded by more oxylophytic types. The extraordinary form of the Odonteschisma is perhaps a response to the extraordinary environmental extreme for this normally distinctly basiphytic species. Associated at this site was also Lophozia latifolia Schuster. t This is true, in our genera, only for Blepharostoma (P1. 64:1, 3) and Microlepi- dozia (P1. 64:5); small forms, which differ from all genera in the previous Suborder jungermanninae, in having the leaves 3-4-lobed, with the lobes only 1-2 cells broad at base, and with rhizoids confined to underleaf bases.</page><page sequence="271">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 527 from a type with deeply divided leaves and underleaves (PI. 64:3, 6), where both leaves and underleaves tend to produce supplementary lobes, and where there is a distinct perianth terminal on the main shoot (PI. 64:3), to a type with the lobing reduced or absent (PI. 65:9), the female inflorescence on a short postical shoot (Pl. 64:6) (with a further tendency for the perianth to become lost and replaced by a perigynium).* This suborder stands, in some ways, intermediate between the Suborder Jungermanninae (treated previously) and the Suborder Porellinae (treated beginning p. 549). As in the former, there is no division into a dorsal "lobe" and ventral "lobule."t As in the latter the leaves are inserted incu- bously (more rarely transversely, but never succubously), and there is reten- tion of large underleaves, at the base of which there occurs a restricted rhi- zoid-initial "field."T The members of this suborder are also characterized by a well-defined tendency to produce 3-4-lobed leaves (this tendency is more or less suppressed only in the Calypogeiaceae) and underleaves (P1. 64:1, 3-9); these divisions may be further divided into or margined with cilia (P1. 63:1- 9). Even in those groups where the leaves have attained an entire form (Pl. 65:2, 6, 10-12), there is a tendency (at least for the underleaves) to show the ancestral condition: in Calypogeia trichomanis and sphagnicola, for in- stance, an occasional leaf is 2- or 3-dentate at the tip (P1. 65:6), and the underleaves are bilobed, with a tendency for the outer margins to develop lateral lobes (i.e., to become 4-lobed). The tendency to produce 3-4-lobed leaves is found in the Suborder Jun- germanninae only in a few members of the Family Lophoziaceae. In the Porellinae there may be a further subdivision into an essentially 3-lobed leaf (the dorsal lobe representing the "lobe," while the divided ventral lobe is represented by a "stylus" and a "lobule"). The Ptilidiinae (as circumscribed here) include only part of the family Ptilidiaceae (or Ptilidioideae) of preceding students. The writer would follow Muller (1951, pp. 196-197) in splitting the family into several (Ptilidiaceae, including Ptilidium, Mastigo- phora, Lepidolaena (?), Neotrichocolea); Trichocoleaceae, including Trichocolea, and ? Trichocoleopsis, possibly others; Blepharostomaceae, including Blepharostoma and ? Lepi- colea; Hygrobiellaceae, including Anthelia, Pleuroclada, Hygrobiella). The genus Iso- tachis should be placed in a separate family, Isotachaceae. Of these families, all but the Hygrobiellaceae belong in the Ptilidiinae. However, Herberta and Herpocladium, until recently placed in the Ptilidiaceae, I would place (following Miiller) in a family Herberta- ceae. Unlike previous students, I would place this far from the present complex, as the first, most primitive, family of Jungermanninae. * In the Jungermanninae there is therefore a sequence such as Lophozia-&gt;Harpanthus -&gt;Geocalyx---Saccogyna. The parallel evolutionary line in the Ptilidiinae would be as follows: Ptilidium-&gt;Lepidozia-&gt;Calypogeia fissa-&gt;C. meylanii. For the student starting a study of the group, such parallel evolution (often actually "convergent" evolution) makes determination of material extremely difficult. t However, in such genera as Ptilidium the ventral lobe or lobes (which are almost resolved into cilia) are bent under the dorsal lobes, almost suggesting a "lobule." j In genera, such as Ptilidium and Trichocolea, which have finely divided leaves, there may be almost no rhizoids; the few which occur, are, in my experience, restricted to the bases of the underleaves.</page><page sequence="272">528 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) The families of the Ptilidiinae fall into two well-defined groups, as is evident from the following key: KEY TO FAMILIES 1.

Capsule-A all 2-stratose, capsule-valves linear, spirally twisted -------- . Calypogeiaceae Family PTILIDIACEAE* This. family includes a small group of genera, of which only Ptilidium occurs locally. The group is characterized by the deeply 3-5-lobed leaves (P1. 63:2-3), which generally bear in addition distinct marginal cilia; the leaves are inserted incubously normally (as in Ptilidium) or may be virtually transverse in insertion. The rhizoids, when at all developed, always are limited to a small regioni at the bases of the underleaves (in our species they are usually totally absent); the underleaves are large, divided and margined like the leaves (P1. 63:4). The sporophyte is relatively unreduced, with the capsule- wall 4 or more cell-layers thick; the seta is formed of numerous layers of cells; mflorescences are terminal. In all of these characters the family agrees with the small group Tricho- coleaceae, of which olily the genus Trichocolea occurs in North America. It differs from the Trichocoleaceae in the collenchymatous, smooth, leaf-cells * The writer would follow the treatment in Miiller (1948; 1950) and Schuster (1949a) as regards circumscription of the Ptilidiaceae. The family as in Spruce (1885), Evans (1939), Frye and Clark (1943) is extremelv heterogeneous and unnatural. The reasons for the present circumscription are given in Schuster (1949a).</page><page sequence="273">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 529 (P1. 63:1, 5, 6) and in the nature of the oil-bodies (Pl. 63:6). The Ptilidia- ceae are furthermore usually strongly pigmented plants, while the Trichoco- leaceae are pale, whitish green plants. Of more taxonomic importance, the Ptilidiaceae have perianths, while the Trichocoleaceae lack them, but have developed a fleshy, rhizoidous perigynium. Finally, the capsule of the Ptilidia- ceae is usually 4-layered, with the outer layer firm, and provided with thicken- ings; in the Trichocoleaceae the capsule-wall is 7-8 cell-layers thick, and the outer layer consists of thin-walled, large delicate cells that soon disintegrate. Both groups are primitive in lacking gemmae or any other type of asexual reproduction. PTILIDIUM Nees Two local species occur: these are large, pinnately branched plants, with the main shoot 1.5-3 mm wide or more (including leaves), and the entire plant 2-6 cm long, or occasionally more. The finely divided leaves, generally brown- ish or reddish-brown color, and pinnate branching are excellent characters by which to recognize the species in the field. KEY TO SPECIES 1. Leaves with the largest (dorsal) lobe 15-25 cells wide at base on leaves_of main stems (P1. 63:3, 5); leaves divided 1/2 (P1. 63:3); the marginal cilia not or scarcely as long as width of dorsal lobe at base (P1. 63:3, 5); tufts dense, deep, luxuriant, lax, usually purplish-red; most often on soil, occasionally on rocks; northern . P. ciliare 1. Leaves with the dorsal lobe narrow, only 6-10 cells wide at base, the marginal cilia longer, many considerably longer than width of ventral lobe at base (P1. 63:1-2); leaves divided 3/4 - 4/5 (P1. 63:2), more closely imbricated; tufts dense, green to tawny brown; on decaying wood or on rocks; southern P. pulcherrimum PTILIDIUM PULCHERRIMUM (Web.) Hampe P1. 63:1, 2 Frequent throughout the Coniferous Forest regions of the state, rare elsewhere. This species is one of the most ubiquitous species in Minnesota. It has, in general, a more southern distribution than P. ciliare, but broadly overlaps in distribution with the latter northward, where both forms may occur abundantly in the same locality. The species occurs rather widely distributed, as far as ecological niches are concerned: it may occur on calcareous sandstones, as at Winona, or may frequent moist basaltic rocks (as along the North Shore of Lake Superior and in the associated ravines or ledges) and may occur at the bases of trees, in such locations; occasionally it may occur several feet up from the base of trees, on bark, as in spruce bogs. Perhaps the most frequent sites are those on decaying logs and stumps, as a member of the Nowellia-Jamesoniella Associ- ule. Correlated with the wide tolerance, the species has a virtually ubiquitous distribu- tion throughout much of our area. Since it occurs under such diverse conditions, under wide ranges as regards moisture, light and pH, it is found associated with a great variety of other Hepaticae. This and the following species may cause difficulty to the beginner, as regards their separation. The present form is smaller, less luxuriant, grows closely appressed to the substratum, forming very thin mats, and has more deeply divided leaves (P1. 63:1-2), with the lamina narrower (only about 6-10 cells wide at base of dorsal lobe); further- more, it usually is a tawny brown in exposed localities, only occasionally becoming reddish brown.

Nees P1. 63:3-6 Frequent or common throughout the Coniferous Panclimax, becoming increasingly rarer southward in the northern edge of the Deciduous Zone. This species is a characteristic form of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, occurring widely through much of the coniferous zone; it has been reported as far south as Winona Coun- ty, however.* Northward it occurs commonly on peaty soil, over cliffs, on soil in bogs, and very often on exposed, sunny banks. Not infrequently it occurs over talus slopes, or on thin soil over cliffs: forming dense carpets even in places where moisture conditions are very intermittent and where insolation is very high: under such conditions it is often the only hepatic, and is associated with "Reindeer Moss" and other lichens. In the ability to withstand more extreme xeric conditions it differs considerably from the more delicate P. pulcherrimum. Though the species may occur under subcalcareous conditions (as directly on slightly moist basaltic ledges), it usually occurs under relatively acid conditions, under pH 3.8-4.8. It may, occasionally, occur with such "calciphiles" as Scapania degenii and Sc. gymnostomophila. This wide toleration makes the species one of the frequently encountered forms northward. The larger size, relatively laxly leafy appearance, broader, less completely "dissolved" lamina (P1. 63:5), and the often purplish-brown color characterize this species, as opposed to P. pulcherrimum. The present form, furthermore, often forms rather deep, loose, almost flocculent mats, with the individual plants suberect where crowded. Distribution.-CARLTON: Carlton, C 690.

The group is very similar to the Ptilidiaceae, but differs in the thin-walled leaf-cells that have a distinctly striolate cuticle (PI. 63:7-8), in the 7-8-stratose capsule-wall (with the outer layer formed of hyaline cells that lack thickenings), and in the absence of a perianth. The perianth is replaced by a fleshy, club-shaped structure, formed partly of stem, partly of the calyptra, and is quite hairy; the species very rarely fruits. The family includes large species, with bi-tripin- nately, feathery branched stems (PI. 63:9), and with the leaves divided almost completely into slender capillary segments (PI. 63:8, 9). TRICHOCOLEA Dumort. TRICHOCOLEA TOMENTELLA (Ehrh.) Dumort. P1. 63:7-9 This large, distinctive species occurs almost without exception in swamps (but never in true bogs) and occasionally on wet, soil-covered ledges and banks in ravines. The species has a well-defined toleration for calciphilous conditions and often occurs with Moerkia hibernica or flotowiana. The critical factors restricting its distribution appear to be a constant water supply, and moderately diffuse light. In swamps, the species often clothes decaying stumps and peaty hummocks, forming dense, luxuriant, deep mats. The very large size (often up to 6-8 cm long), regularly 2-3-pinnate form, the deli. cate, strongly divided leaves (with the lamina reduced to a few inconspicuous, linear lobes), the numerous, hair-like cilia, and the constantly whitish or yellowish-white color are quite characteristic. The species is more likely to be overlooked for a large moss by the beginner, than confused with another Hepatic. This species occurs not infrequently in Douglas County, Wisconsin, directly adjoining Minnesota. In addition it was reported from Minnesota, without any mention of exact locality, by I. A. Lapham, in 1875. It is almost certain, therefore, that the species will be found in our region, at least on the eastern borders. Extensive collecting in the sub- calcareous bogs of the Lake Agassiz Depression, where Moerkia, Plagiochila, Geocalyx, Calypogeia meylanii, and other species generally associated with the Trichocolea frequently occur has not resulted in its discovery there: it is therefore apparent that the species occurs near its western borders, at this latitude, in western Wisconsin and will extend only a little way, if at all, into Minnesota. Family BLEPHAROSTOMACEAE This family includes only the single genus Blepharostoma (with a single local species). The group is isolated in many regards,* and stands in some ways between the Ptilidioid-Trichocoleoid complex, and the Lepidozioid com- plex. Within recent years it has been put either into the Ptilidiaceae or the Lepidoziaceae. The family differs from both of these groups in that the transversely in- serted leaves are normally 4-lobed to the base, with each lobe a single cell wide to base (P1. 64:1, 3); the underleaves are similarly 3-lobed (PI. 64:4). The sporophyte of the group is reduced, with the seta formed of four inner rows of cells, surrounded by 8 outer rows; such a reduced seta occurs in the Cepha- loziaceae, but not in other families of Ptilidiinae. The capsule-wall is also reduced and only 2-cell layers thick, and the spores are about equal in diam- * As has been recently emphasized by Miiller (1948).</page><page sequence="277">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 533 eter to the elaters (as in the Cephaloziaceae, but unlike any other Ptilidiinae). The group has a terminal, distally somewhat trigonous perianth (PI. 64:3); in the terminal position of the perianth the family differs from the Lepido- ziaceae. The group gives the impression of a reduced group, derived from the Ptilidiaceae. It agrees with the Calyp6geiaceae (arnd differs from other fam- ilies of Ptilidiinae) in that it occasionally produces 1-celled gemmae. BLEPHAROSTOMA Dumort. BLEPHAROSTOMA TRICHOPHYLLUM (L.) Dumort. Fig. 14:1; P1. 64:1-4 This species is widely distributed, in a number of situations, throughout the Conifer- ous Forest Climax, but becomes very rare as one approaches the Deciduous Climax. There are no stations from Minnesota for the deciduous region, though eastward the species is not infrequent southward into the region of broad-leaved trees. This again suggests that moisture conditions, rather than climate, are the limiting factor in the distribution of the species southward and westward. Northward the species become nearly ubiquitous: occurring very widely on moist, shaded rocks, with such calciphiles as Scapania gymnostomophila, Tritomaria scitula, Lophozia grandiretis, and Odontoschisma macounii, here under a pH of 5.5-6.8. On peaty banks the species is still able to hold its own, occurring with Lepidozia reptans, Bazzania trilobata, Odontoschisma denudatum and Lophozia porphyroleuca, under pH conditions of from 4.0-5.2. Under intermediate conditions, on soil covered ledges and banks, it occurs among mosses and such Hepaticae as Tritomaria quinquedentata, T. scitula, Lepidozia reptans, under pH conditions of 5.0-6.2. In addition, it is found abun- dantly on decaying logs, associated with Jamesoniella autumnalis, Lophozia ascendens, Scapania apiculata, Sc. glaucocephala, Lepidozia reptans, and Cephalozia spp., under pH 4.6-5.2. The limiting factors in the distribution of this delicate species appear to be the necessity of constant moisture and relatively diffuse light; for that reason it is abundant on vertical rock outcrops, where the crest is covered with a dense peaty growth that over- hangs enough to shade the rock-wall, and supplies, by capillary action, a steady supply of moisture. Here the species grows abundantly with Lepidozia reptans, and occasionally with A. (Sphenolobus) minutum, Diplophyllum taxifolium and Lophozia ventricosa. Although on the exposed cliffs of the islands of Lake Superior it is able to compete on peaty banks, creeping over Sphagnum, it appears entirely unable to succeed in peat bogs; the rarity of the species at pH 3.8-4.5 suggests that the optimum pH is somewhere above that figure. At the same time, only poorly developed and sparse material has been found associated with such extreme calciphytes as Lophozia (Leiocolea) gillmani, at a pH of 6.8-7.0. Southward the species becomes more restricted in distribution, and appears unable to tolerate the subcalcareous conditions it frequents northward; here it becomes restricted to decaying logs and humus, chiefly in swamps and ravines. This species is usually easily overlooked in the field, since it most often grows as scat- tered stems creeping among other bryophytes. When in pure mats (as on vertical moist rock-walls), it forms very thin, yellowish or whitish green extensive mats. It is so distinct from other species occurring in the state that confusion is very unlikely. The leaves, which are divided to the base into four lobes consisting each of a single row of cells (P1. 64:1, 3), and the similar underleaves (which are normally trifid, however), at once identify the species. The pure green color (rarely whitish green in exposed places), and the confervoid, or algal appearance, and small size, as well as great delicacy are char- acteristic.

Family LEPIDOZIACEAE The members of this family can at once be recognized by the fact that the leaves are incubous (more rarely transverse) and are 3-4-lobed or toothed at the apex. Unlike the Ptilidiaceae and Blepharostomaceae, which may have similar leaves, the leaf-lobes or teeth are 2-many cells wide at the base (P1. 64:5), never like cilia in form, and never uniseriate.* The underleaves are similar to the leaves, in their large size, and in the fact that they are usually lobed or toothed like the leaves (P1. 64:6, 8, 9). In this family the rhizoids (where present) are sharply restricted to the bases of the underleaves, occupy- ing a discrete rhizoid-initial field. Some vegetative branches and the short branches which bear the trigonous perianths originate from the axils of under- leaves - (Pl. 64:6). The members of this family are also characterized by a well-developed tendency for the development of flagelliform branches bearing reduced leaves (P1. 64:6, 8, 9). Gemmae are never developed.

The species has a wide tolerance, as regards pH, northward, but southward appears more restricted. In the north the species may occur on soil over basic rocks, where the pH is 6.0-6.5, but becomes much more common on humus-covered or peaty soil, where the pH is 3.7-6.0; here it is associated with a large number of species, but especially Blepharostoma trichophyllum, Lophozia ventri- cosa, Bazzania trilobata, Tritomaria quinquedentata, etc. In addition, the species frequents shaded, perpetually moist vertical rockwalls, where it occurs widely with Blepharostoma, Diplophyllum taxifotium, and Lophozia ventricosa, Anastrophyllum (Sphenolobus) minu- tum, etc. As a xylicole and humicole it is associated usually with Blepharostoma tricho- phyllum, and Jamesoniella, Nowellia, Cephatlozia spp., and with the rare Scapania apiculata and glaucocephala (pH 4.6-5.2). The distribution appears to be restricted chiefly by the inability of the species to tolerate very basic conditions, as well as extreme- ly acid conditions (it is absent, for instance, in niches where the calciphiles, L. (Leio- colea) gillmani and Scapania gymnostomophila abound, and is lacking under conditions of pH 3.2-3.6, in peat bogs), and by the relatively high and constant moisture require- ments, as well as by the low toleration of light. The species is rarely able to compete successfully in bright sunlight, and occurs commonly under light conditions of 3.6-12 FC. The incubous leaves, with the apices decurved and 3-4-lobed, giving them the appear- ance, when seen ventrally, of a cupped hand (P1. 64:6), at once identify this species; this, together with the frequent presence of terminal flagellae (P1. 64:6), and the regular- ly pinnate branching serve to characterize the species in the field. There is no other species it can well be confused with. The plants are usually about 1 mm wide, and are either whitish or yellowish-green (except where much shaded, when pure green).* Distribution.-ANOKAIISANTI: Cedar Creek Bog, S 14847, S 14065, pH3.7.

MICROLEPIDOZIA Joergensen MICROLEPIDOZIA SETACEA (Web.) Joetg. Fig. 14:3; P1. 64:5 This species is limited in occurrence to peat bogs, where it is a rare member of the Mylia-Calypogeia sphagnicola Associule, in areas where there is underlying lime. It occurs chiefly on the drier tops of the peat hummocks, under less hygric conditions than Cladopodiella, but may occur on rotting logs near the edges of the bogs. * On very dry logs or stumps (as on log on Sand I., Apostle Isls., Wisconsin), the species often occurs as a reduced small-leaved, strongly imbricate modification, then only 0.2-0.25 mm wide. Such xerophytic extremes (found at the above site with Odontoschis- ma denudatum and the moss Dicranella) are quite atypical in appearance. Such depau- perate extremes usually have only 3-lobed leaves and largely 2-lobed underleaves.</page><page sequence="281">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 537 The general appearance of this species is like that of Blepharostoma, but the latter never occurs in Sphagnum bogs, and has the more filiform, slender leaf-lobes that are only a single cell wide to the very base, while the lobes ate 2 cells wide at base (P. 64:5) in the present species. This species has not yet been found as far west as Minnesota; it occurs in Michigan and may yet be found in some of our peat bogs. BAZZANIA S. F. Gray BAZZANIA TRILOBATA (L.) Gray P1. 64:7-9 This large, very distinctive species normally forms deep, dense mats, in which the individual plants are nearly erect; not infrequently it occurs less luxuriantly, growing decumbent on the ground, or creeping over peat. The species has an apparently very low toleration for lime, and occurs in bogs or swamps with underlying marl deposits only in the very late stages, and is then confined to decaying logs and stumps, on which it forms dense, luxuriant deep, dark green mats. Near the shore of Lake Superior it is largely confined to peaty banks, where it grows usually over Sphagnum, under pH condi- tions of about 3.8-4.8, and is associated with Calypogeia sphagnicola, Lepidozia reptans, Mylia anomala, Lophozia incisa and porphyroleuca. When the species grows on soil- covered banks, as in ravines, it is rare under conditions where the soil has not been thor- oughly leached of lime, when on basic rocks, a dense mat of acid humus must be formed by more tolerant species before the Bazzania is able to invade. The species is able to gr'ow under conditions of physiological drought, as on rather dry, acid peat on cliff- crests (here it assumes a whitish color), but occurs most luxuriantly and forms deep tufts only when there is an abundant moisture supply, and where conditions are less exposed, and direct sunlight is very intermittent. In swamps and bogs, where the humidi- ty is sufficiently high, it may indeed invade the bark of trees, up to a height of 3-6 feet; there it is a scarcely recognizable, depauperate form. The species is widespread throughout nearly all of the Coniferous forest zone, but in Minnesota is rare in the Deciduous Climax region. This appears to be due more to the lower moisture conditions, than to any temperature factor, since the species is abun- dant eastward in the deciduous region. The very large size (to 3-6 mm wide and 10 cm long), the somewhat furcate branch- ing, the incubous tridenticulate leaves (P1. 64:7-9), and the numerous filiform flagellae issuing from the postical side of the plant (P1. 64:8-9) are quite distinctive.

There is no perianth: but a fleshy, subterranean, hairy petigynium is to be found, originating on an extremely short branch originat- ing from the axil of an underleaf (Fig. 12:3). The small, spike-like androecia originate similarly. The unique, cylindrical capsules have linear, twisted valves (Fig. 12:3). There is a single genus in the country, consisting of moderate or rather small plants, 0.5-3 mm wide and 1.5-5 cm long, that are at once known in the field by their pale, generally rather transparent, bluish-green or whitish green color.

Muller P1. 65:1-2 This species is relatively northern in distribution, and does not occur in the Deciduous Forest areas. It is also more limited in occurrence than our other species of the genus, and appears to be entirely confined to decaying logs. Any small Calypogeia on decaying logs, with the shoots less than 1.2 mm wide can be almost automatically assigned to suecica. On decaying logs it is associated with such species as Lophozia porphyroleuca, Riccardia latifrons and palmata, Lophozia incisa, ascendens and longidens, A. hellerianum, and the various Cephalozia species (media, catenulata, etc). Like C. sphagnicola, but unlike our other species, this form occurs only under conditions of a very low pH (about 4.2-5.0). It never occurs on substrates containing much lime or other inorganic salts. The species has other characteristics in common with sphagnicola, in addition to the lack of toleration for a mineral substrate. Among them are the small size, the small leaf-cells (mostly less than 30 x 35 ?l) (P1. 60:1), and the leaf-form. Many forms of suecica may have the underleaves very similar in form to those of sphagnicola (P1. 60:2). Both species show a tendency to develop obtuse lateral teeth on the underleaf-margins; C. suecica, however, has the underleaves usually wider than long and often with most of them possessing obtuse lateral lobes; in sphagnicola the underleaves are mostly as long as wvide, and only occasionally are armed with lateral teeth. Furthermore, sphagnicola has the leaf-cells distinctly larger than suecica, and never occurs on decaying wood (though wet wood lying in sphagnum bogs may be locally invaded, if the pH is low enough). C. suecica differs from sphagnicola also in that it is dioecious (sphagnicold and all our other species are monoecious), and in that the epidermal cells of the capsule-wall lack local thickenings.</page><page sequence="284">540 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 9. 1~~0.

CALYPOGEIA SPHAGNICOLA (Anm. &amp; Perss.) Warnstf. &amp; Loeske P1. 65:3-8 This species has been much overlooked by American collectors, but is quite frequent in Sphagnum bogs, associated with Mylia anomala, Cephaloziella elachista, Cephalozia pleniceps and connivens, and occasionally with Lophozia marchica and Cladopodiella fluitans.* In bogs it occurs most frequently along the nearly vertical sides of deer trails cut through the peat; along these it may form nearly pure patches, growing as a thin layer over dead peat mosses, but is more frequent merely as an accessory species, occur- ring as scattered delicate stems among other Hepaticae, or among Sphagnum.t The species usually favors semi-shaded locations (such as the north or west facing slopes of deer trails, or sphagnum hummocks), and here occurs as a leptodermous modi- fication, with thin, pellucid cell walls and no or extremely minute trigones. Such a phase produces gemmae very abundantly and is characterized by the masses of strict, attenuate gemmiparous shoots, bearing small tufts of yellow-green gemmae at the apices. This phase may occur in less shaded areas, if conditions are extremely hygrophytic. This thin-walled modification has been known as C. paludosa Warnst. The British and Scan- dinavian bryologists have limited the name spbagnicola, in past years, to the pachyder- mous modification, with thick cell-walls, and often brownish pigmentation, and with few gemmae formed. This thick-walled form occurs usually on drier sites, at the exposed, sunny summits of peat-bog hummocks, or in bogs further advanced ecologically, and with the water-table further from the surface. Between these two extremnes, but nearer paludosa, stands C. tenuis Evans, with thin cell-walls and rather distinct trigones. Buch (1936) has treated these three forms as members of one species, brought forth by varying combinations of the physical environment. Local studies indicate his view is completely correct. In fact, age appears occasionally to be of importance: mature, or old leaves may have very thick walled cells (matching the illustration in Macvicar), and be a little brownish pigmented, while leaves further up the stem may represent the present season's growth, while the pachydermous phase may be the previous year's growth. The species is quite delicate and much smaller than C. neesiana and trichomanis. The latter two species have the cells of the leaf-apices mostly 32-42 IL long, and have no trigones. The present species agrees much more closely with the other species of Caly- pogeia, C. suecica, as regards size (plants mostly 0.5-2.0 cm long, 0.5-1.8 mm wide) and deeply divided underleaves (half or more bilobed); in both species the apical mar- ginal leaf cells are only 23-32 IL long, on an average (P1. 65:5); in both species there are frequently distinct trigones (P1. 65:1, 7, usually developed more strongly in suecica). The differentiation from suecica is given under the latter. The occurrence of the present species is characteristic; among or associated with Sphagnum, in the Heath stage, often under Ledum, Kalmia polifolia, Chameadaphne calyculata, and Andromeda glaucophyla.

Corda P1. 65:9, 12 Although this species "enjoys" a wider range and evidently more ubiquitous habitat distribution than any other of the Nearctic species, in the literature, actual study of mate- rials shows that this is largely, if not entirely, based on erroneous species concepts. The writer has seen only a very few specimens of true C. trichomanis from eastern and middle North America (none from the Great Lakes Region). The inclusion of the species here therefore must be regarded as provisional (and based on the two reports of the species from Minnesota, by Conklin, 1942). The ecological toleration of this species, and its consequent amplitude of distribution, must be much narrower than one gains from study of the literature. In fact, the distribu- tion of the species appears to be very sporadic. True C. trichomanis has been collected by the writer on decaying logs (Mt. Katahdin, Maine), and rarely in boggy areas. All of the material from damp to moist loamy banks, uniformly referred to this species in the North American Literature, has been found to represent C. muelleriana (or the very similar C. fissa). C. trichomanis differs from all described Nearctic species of the genus in the blue oil-bodies. This characteristic is readily evident in the field, especially in the apical region of the shoot (where the oil-bodies are concentrated because of the smaller size of the cells), which is usually a beautiful turquoise blue color.* 'When dry material is examined, confusion is apt to arise chiefly with the closely similar C. muelleriana, with which C. trichomanis has in common the broadly ovate, somewhat heart-shaped, entire leaves, the robust size, bilobed underleaves, similar cell-size, etc. C. muelleriana, however, normally has larger underleaves, more shallowly bilobed (with the lobes often obtuse or rounded), which may be 2-2.5 as wide as the stems. Furthermore, it has colorless oil- bodies. Superficially this species also resembles neesiana and fissa, which it generally slightly exceeds in size and robustness. It differs from both of these species in that the leaves of mature stems are wider than long, very broadly ovate in shape (P1. 65:9, 12), and more or less pointed or rounded-pointed at the apex (on weak, immature shoots occa- sionally some leaves bidentate). The underleaves are from scarcely wider than the stem to nearly twice as wide, and are nearly circular in outline, with the lateral margins unarmed, but bilobed about 1/2 - 2/3 their length (P1. 65:12). The form of the under- leaves is quite characteristic and allies the species more closely with sphagnicola. The latter, however, is a much smaller and more delicate species, which has considerably smaller cells. When living material is available, the bluish color of the oil-bodies of trichomanis is absolutely diagnostic. Distribution.-Although reported from Ontario, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and almost every other state and province in Eastern North America, the range of this species is quite uncertain. True C. trichomanis has been seen by the present writer (personal collections) only from Maine and New York. The broad-leaved Caly- pogeia previously called C. trichomanis in this country, appears to represent C. muel- leriana (see p. 543). The following two reports from Minnesota should be checked when the material becomes again available (at present not accessible): CHISAGO: Fran- conia, H. COOK: Pigeon River, C 3040. * However, a second, undescribed species, also with blue oil-bodies, occurs in the southeast. This is otherwise similar to C. fissa. It will be described shortly in a genera! treatment of the genus as it occurs in North America.</page><page sequence="287">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 543 CALYPOGEIA MUELLERIANA (Schiffn.) K. Muller P1. 66:1-4 Widely distributed throughout much of the northern part of the Deciduous and Coniferous Zones of Europe, but its distribution virtually unknown in North America, from which it was only very recently reported (Schuster, 1949). The species occurs very largely like the closely related C. neesiana and C. trichomanis: under a wide variety of conditions, in bogs, on shaded, moist, wooded slopes, etc. Its ecological distribution and pH preferendum are not yet known, but the few records from North America are in part from calcareous regions. This species, in my experience, is difficult to separate from meylanii. Apparently Buch, who described the latter, experienced this difficulty, since he included material of both in his species meylanii. C. muelleriana shares with meylanii the rounded leaf-tips, presence of oil-bodies in all cells of the lateral leaves, and somewhat similar underleaves. K. Muller (1947) stresses the difference in size of oil-bodies as a differentiating charac- ter between the two forms, as well as the larger cells of the leaf- and underleaf-middle. In addition, muelleriana, typically, has the leaves decidedly broader than long (P1. 66:4), while all forms of neesiana and meylanii, except for var. repanda, have them longer than wide (P1. 66:6, 8-9, 14). In my experience, none of these characters offer an absolutely safe separation, at least as far as North American material goes. The oil-bodies in neesi- ana (and meylanii, which Miller places in neesiana) are supposedly up to 5-7 ,u long, while those of muelleriana are up to 12-14 ,u long. However, in five plants, selected from a single collection'of meylanii I find the oil-bodies in many cells varying from 4 x 8 to 5.5 x 13 A (P1. 66:5), in individual cells averaging between 10 and 12 ,u long, and composed of 10-16 oil-globules (according to Miller the largest oil-bodies of this species are supposedly formed by only 6-9 oil-globules). Miller' claims that Buch's statement that neesiana and trichomanis have the largest oil-bodies is incorrect. It is apparent that my measurements, taken from material that is otherwise very typical meylanii, coincide neither with the figures or illustrations given by Miiller, nor quite with those given by Buch. It is apparent then, that either Buch (working in Finland) and Miller (working with German material) have considerably different genotypes before them than are repre- sented by the living American material before me, or that there is much more non-genetic variation in the oil-body size than Miller would ascribe to neesiana. At any rate, I am totally unable to find any significant difference in this regard (even when large numbers of oil-bodies from various leaves and plants are measured) between the two species. Muller also ascribes rather great differences in size of the cells of the leaf-middle, and of the underleaf-middle, to the two species. Those of neesiana are supposedly 40 ,u long (on an average), those of muelleriana 50-80 , long. Unfortunately, much of the material that is nearly typical meylanii has the leaf-cells averaging from 40-46 A long or even 50-60 ,u, while I have seen German material of muelleriana with the cells averaging only 50-54 A long. Similarly, if the exact middle of the leaf is measured in a series of leaves of muelleriana of the Michigan material (and the New York material), the cells aver- age only 48-60 ,u long. Muller, possibly, based his description on a hygric modification with unusually large cells. The size of the median cells of the underleaves is also scarce- ly as sharply different in the two forms as Muller intimates in his key, although I find that the difference here is apparently more constant. I have before me, however, material of meylanii from the bog at Grand Portage, Cook Co. in which the median portion of underleaves is only 6-9 cells long, with the average cell-length (three cell-rows adjoining measured and averaged) varying from 54 to 60 A, with individual cells up to 76 ,u long. Finally, the leaf in neesiana (and meylanii) is usually distinctly longer than wide, but I find occasional robust stems have the leaf fully as wide as long (as in material from Cascade Ravine, Minn.); disturbingly enough, such plants show a tendency to have the underleaves slightly more bilobed (P1. 66:12), and the material from Cascade, Minn. (which grows intermingled with more typical meylanii, and has identical oil-bodies with it) ha the, underleaves scarcely less bilobed than in forms of muelleriana.</page><page sequence="288">544 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) It is evident, therefore, that American material of meylanii and muelleriana are not as sharply distinct in any of the several characters used to separate them in the recent revi- sion of the genus by Muller (1947). In fact, muelleriana, in my limited experience, grades into meylanii almost as completely as does neesiana.

However, robust plants of the two species show a tendency for larger cells in the under- leaves in C. muelleriana (and, correlated a length of only 4-6 cells along the underleaf- middle, from rhizoid-initial disk to sinus) than in C. meylanii (where in most cases there are 8-10 cells along the midline of the underleaf from rhizoid-initial disk to apex of the underleaf). C. muelleriana, in my experience, is also almost impossible to keep sharply distinct from C. fissa. There occur many plants, with the deeply divided underleaves, armed sharply laterally, typical of C. fissa, but with the broad, entire, heart-shaped lateral leaves of C. muelleriana. Where the distinction between these two species is to be drawn appears very problematical. The author has become aware of this problem repeatedly (in material from New York, south to Georgia and Mississippi). Distribution.-Unknown, as yet from Minnesota. Occurring, however, from Quebec to Alaska and British Columbia, south to South Carolina, and Mississippi, west in the United States at least to Michigan (Deer Lake, w. of Munising, Schuster, 1949). CALYPOGEIA FISSA (L.) Raddi Fig. 12:3; P1. 65:10, 11 Although this species has been reportec' from eastern Iowa (Conard, 1945), it is unknown from Minnesota. It is doubtful whether it will be found as far west and north as the latter state. The species occurs essentially in the Deciduous Forest Region, and is of suboceanic distribution (becoming rare west of the Appalachian Plateau and, south- ward, north of the Gulf Coastal Plain). Typically, this species occurs on mineral sub- strates only, most commonly on shaded clay or loam banks (there often with Atrichum and other mosses, such as Pogonatum pensilvanicum, and very frequently with Diplophyl- lum apiculatum and Scapanid nemarosa); less frequently it occurs as a pioneer on shadc-A damp rocks. The species appears to occur nearly indiscriminately in slightly calcareous cites, and over decidedly acidic substrates (such as acid igneous rocks). When typically developed, C. fissa can often be recognized in the field by the narrow- ly ovate leaves (clearly longer than wide), subacute at the apex or occasionalAy slightly bidentate (P1. 65:10-11).t In the leaf-form, the species approaches C. neesiana and meylanii, to which it bears only a distant relationship. It differs from these species in the deeply bilobed underleaves, the outer margins of which often each bear an obtuse angula- tion or tooth (P1. 65:10-11), and in the subisodiametric marginal leaf-cells. More closely related to C. fissa are the two typically broad-leaved species, C. trichomanis and muel- leriana. The colorless oil-bodies and obtuse lobes of the underleaves (and tendency for their sides to be armed) separate C. fissa from trichomanis. In these two characteristics,, the species closely approaches many forms of C. muelleriana, from which distinction is at times exceedingly difficult. This is particularly the case with lax forms of fissa, in which the leaves may be somewhat heart-shaped and virtually as wide as long (and then similar * I also think that muelleriana is undoubtedly specifically distinct from meylanii. Both species, however, have such an amplitude of variation that their extreme modifications are scarcely separable. j The various manuals often stress as a species character the bidentate condition of the leaf-apices of C. fissa. It deserves emphasis that (at least in American material), this is the case only with leaves of etiolated or juvenile shoots, with mature plants showing bidentate leaves only occasionally or exceptionally. Furthermore, various poorly developed or juvenile manifestations of C. muelleriana and trichomanis also exhibit a tendency, even if less marked, to develop occasional to frequent narrowly bidentate lateral leaves. For these reasons, the form of the leaf-apex in the fissa-muelleriana-trichomanis complex is to be regarded as scarcely of taxonomic importance.</page><page sequence="290">546 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) to the leaves of muelleriana in form). The writer has been unable to find any differences in the form of the oil-bodies, which are colorless in both species (though Miiller (1947), indicates such differences occur). In general, however, the more deeply bifid underleaves, usually much smaller (less than twice as wide as stem), with a broader, more open sinus, and the narrower lateral leaves, allow a distinction to be made between C. fissa and muel- leriana. The problem of distinguishing these two taxa is dealt with in much greater detail in a revision of the genus, by the writer (Schuster, Mss). CALYPOGEIA MEYLANII Buch Pls. 66:5-13; 67 This species is widespread throughout much of the deciduous panclimax of the eastern states, as well as throughout the coniferous bogs, chiefly of Thuya, or Cedar Swamps, in the densely shaded, wet ground-layer of which it may be a very abundant component of the Hepatic Flora.* The species, in its local form at least, is decidedlv lime-tolerating, and gives the impression of being a decided calciphile. In the marly Thuya swamps it occurs often with Riccardia multifida and latifrons, as well as Geo- calyx, Moerkia flotowiana, and occasionally with Lepidozia reptans. The species also occurs in the ravines of the North Shore, chiefly on moist springy, calcareous slopes, under shaded conditions. Though a species of slightly calcareous regions locally, it seems to rarely invade bare calcareous or subcalcareous rock-surfaces (as on Big Susie I.), but is most often a species invading after the marl containing substrate is carpeted over by humus. This peculiar combination of underlying calcareous conditions coupled with rather high content of humic acids seems especially favorable for this species. In very marly areas it may be restricted to wet decayed stumps and humus, together with Geocalyx, Blepharostoma, Cephalozia media, etc.- In more acid bogs, it often persists, occasionally associated with Cephalozia pleniceps and connivens, and with Calypogeia sphagnicola. Similarly, it is occasionally found on acid peaty banks in calcareous areas, associated with Lophozia ventricosa and Calypogeia sphagnicola, Mylia anomala, etc. The chief requirements for the species appear to be relatively diffuse light, and rather high and constant moisture conditions. It never forms large mats in the open parts of swamps or bogs, but becomes extremely common in the closed portions, and in such shaded sites as bog holes, where the light may be only 1/40 - 1/50 normal daylight. The species is usually very easily recognized: it has a peculiar pale hyaline bluish to grayish green color. From all other species (except neesiana) it differs in the very large, nearly or quite entire underleaves, usually 2.0-3.0 times as wide as the stem, and most often distinctly approximate or imbricate (PI. 66:7, 10, 12, 13). The lateral leaves are rounded or rounded truncate at the apex, never bidentate, and are obliquely ovate: always slightly to distinctly longer than wide, unlike trichomanis (P1. 66:6, 8, 9, 11, 13). Though meylanii can usually be easily distinguished (after a time even in the field, by the naked eye), there are forms that are difficult to place. The species approaches two others closely in its vegetative characters: muelleriana and neesiana. Indeed it is so close to neesiana that Muller (1947) has refused to recognize it. In general the narrow leaves, clearly longer than broad, and the smaller leaf-cells will separate meylanii from muelleriana. Furthermore, the underleaves in meylanii are entire or only retuse at the apex (P1. 66:7, 10, 12-13), while they are narrowly emarginate in muelleriana, with rounded or obtuse lobes (P1. 66:1-3). In meylanii (and neesiana) the underleaves tend to be truncate at the base and non-decurrent (P1. 66:7, 10, 13); in muelleriana they are more gradually narrowed basally and usually slightly decurrent (P1. 66:1-3); these differ- ences are very subtle, however, and often seem non-existent. The underleaves in mature plants of meylanii (and neesiana) are usually large and formed of very many cells, with the median ones averaging about 40 ju (rarely less, rarely up to 48 L); in muelleriana they are composed of fewer, larger cells, the median ones usually being over 50 Al long (compare P1. 66:2 and 7). These differences all seem more or less bridged by interme- * Previously called neesiana in the American literature.

Muller (1947) assigns very large oil-bodies to muelleriana, and states those of the neesiana-meylanii complex are much smaller and no more than 5-7 ,u. In American plants of typical meylanii they, however, are up to 6 x 12 ,u or even larger in many cells (P1. 66:5). (See also the discussion under C. muelleriana.)

Typically, meylanii has most of the cells of the leaf-margins not or little elongate parallel to the leaf-margins (P1. 66:8), except near the basal half of the leaf, where they generally become elongate: in true neesiana the apices of the leaves show a rarely interrupted border of extremely elongate cells (in one or two marginal rows), that give the leaf a very distinct facies (P1. 66:14-15). Furthermore, meylanii has a slightly different leaf-shape, with the leaves usually narrowly rounded at the apex (P1. 66:6, 8, 11, 13) only exceptionally somewhat truncate-retuse (as in P1. 66:9); in true neesiana the leaves tend to be truncate-retuse at the tip (P1. 66:14-15). Further- more, the leaves in meylanii are widest at or near the base, and are distinctly obliquely, narrowly ovate (P1. 66:6, 8); in neesiana the leaves are widest distinctly above the base, and approach an oval form in most cases (P1. 66:14). Finally, meylanii tends to have the rhizoid initial areas broadly, transversely oval on mature leaves (P1. 66:7, 10, 12), while they are narrowly elliptical or even linear in true neesiana. Buch has also stressed that in meylanii all cells of the leaf-middle show oil-bodies; this has consistently been the case in Minnesota specimens (P1. 66:5); in true neesiana only the basal and marginal cells show oil-bodies.* As Miuller (1947) insists, none of these differences are absolutely constant, and the two species are admittedly "uncomfortably close." However, all of the many plants I have seen of meylanii are clearly referable to that species, and I have seen no true neesiana from Minnesota.

Muller P1. 66:14, 15 This species has been reported from over the greater part of the forested regions of the United States and Canada. Most of these reports (and all I could personally check) refer to meylanii, however. The range of neesiana remains unknown therefore; two records by Conklin (1942) from northeastern Minnesota of neesiana should be verified.t C. neesiana is apparently a species of more acid substrates than meylanii. It occurs most frequently in peat bogs, over Sphagnum, at a very low pH. Here it may be asso- ciated with Cephaloziella species (elachista, subdentata), with C. sphagnicola, Mylia and Cephalozia loitlesbergeri, etc. All of the material seen from peat bogs I have found in Minnesota is meylanii, however, but individual plants of a collection from a bog at Big Bay, north of Hoveland, closely approximate true neesiana. * However, in material from New York and Tennessee, referable to C. neesiana there is much variation in the distribution of the oil-bodies. Some lateral leaves show no oil-bodies in most median cells; others show them present in all but isolated median cells; others appear to show oil-bodies in every living cell examined. j I have collected material of C. neesiana (typical) only from Mt. Katahdin, Maine (there above tree-level, on peat, with Cephaloziella subdentata, Mylia anomala, etc., growing in an acid Empetrum nigrum-Vaccinium heath on the Garfield Ridge), from Mt. Leconte, Tenn. (there on moist acid soil under Rhododendron catawbiense, and on damp acidic rocks), and in New York (Forest of Dean Lake, near Ft. Montgomery; there under the acid-releasing Tsuga canadensis, on a relatively dry but peaty bank, with Nardia insecta, Diplaphyllum apiculatum, Calypogeia fissa, Leucobryum glaucum, and Lophozia capitata). As is evident, the distribution of this species appears restricted to strongly acidic sites. Persson (ad. lit.) also informs me he has seen good material from Quebec.</page><page sequence="293">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 549 Living material of neesiana supposedly can be separated from our other species be- cause of the absence of oil-bodies in the leaf-middle. It is also our only species with very obviously elongate marginal leaf-cells (P1. 66:14-15) of the leaf-tips.* For the separa- tion from the closely related meylanii, see under that species. Suborder PORELLINAE Schuster The members of this suborder are leafy plants, like the Jungermanninae and Ptilidiinae. They differ from both of the latter groups in that the leaf is essentially two lobed, and has the ventral lobe smaller (usually specialized as a variously formed "lobule") (Pls. 68:4, 10; 69:4, 8). This lobule is bent under and hidden by the much laeger dorsal lobe, forming a sort of water-sac in which water is retained for periods of drought. The dorsal lobes are incubously shingled and inserted (i.e., the anterior leaf-margin lies over the leaf in front), as in the Calypogeiaceae (Pls. 69:6; 70:4). In addition to the very unique type of leaf, the members of this suborder have certain other features in common: they are pioneer species, without exception (never occurring on humus or peat, or decaying logs), invading such surfaces as bark of trees, smooth rock-faces or stones, etc. They also share in common several vegetative types of reproduction not found in other leafy Hepaticae: reproducing either by flat, many-celled "discoid" brood-bodies (Radulaceae, some Frullaniaceae and Lejeuneaceae), or by caducous leaves (Radulaceae, P1. 69:1, some Frullaniaceae, P1. 72:1, 3, and Lejeuneaceae), but never by 1-2-celled gemmae. All of them agree in the very restricted positions to which the rhizoids are confined: either to a small field at the bases of the underleaves (Porellaceae, Frullaniaceae and Lejeuneaceae) (Pls. 68:10; 71:6) or to an elevated region of the ventral lobe (Radulaceae) (P1. 69:1). Furthermore, they all have reduced sporophytes, with the seta very short (Pl. 68:3), and the capsule globose (ovoid only in Radul). In the two lower families (Porellaceae and Radulaceae) the spores are smaller and the elaters are free; in the other two families (Frullaniaceae, Lejeuneaceae) the elaters are fiKed to the capsules and trumpet-shaped, and the spores are larger. The latter and other characteristics caused Spruce (1885) to separate the last two families as a distinct group (the Jubulae) that has been used by some as a subordinal group. KEY TO FAMILIESt 1. Ventral lobes (lobules) not or little inflated (Pls. 68:4, 10; 69:1); stylus absent; capsule with elaters tapering to both ends, free; spores 20-45 ,u (rarely larger); * As Buch (1942) has admitted, the border of sharply elongate cells of the leaf- margin is most distinct in smaller (juvenile?) leaves, and on juvenile plants. On the most robust plants, the leaves show often only traces of the border, and distinction from C. meylanii becomes almost impossible. Since the writer has shown (in material from New York), that the criterion of oil-body distribution also breaks down, the characteris- tics upon which separation of C. neesiana and meylanii depends are excessively slim. TIreatment of C. meylanii and neesiana as distinct ecotypes, or varieties, of a common species (C. neesiana) is indicated. This was actually proposed by the writer (1949), but is now felt to have been premature, since the final data of biological isolation of the two taxa are not available. t See also the general key to families of the order Jungermanniales, p. 302.</page><page sequence="294">550 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) perianth not sharply beaked at mouth (Pls. 68:3; 69:2) ----------------------------------------2 2.

The species has a wide pH tolerance: occurring in acid waters and in the somewhat basic waters of ravines cut through basic rocks.

Confusion is possible only with the aquatic forms of Chiloscyphus, but if the underside of the plant is examined the small (and easily overlooked) ventral lobes of the Porella at once identify it, as well as the unlobed underleaves. The very narrow, non-decurrent underleaves (P1. 68:10), and the similarly shaped, lingulate "lobules" (P1. 68:10) will separate the species from the other local Porella species.

P1. 68:4.9 Widely distributed throughout almost all of eastern North America, from the sub- tropics to the Subarctic-subalpine zone, but absent in the Tundra Region. In Minnesota frequent along the eastern edge of the state, but of restricted occurrence westward and in the extreme northeast. The species is a pioneer over exposed sites that have in common only a very intermittent water-supply, such as dry bark of trees, exposed roots and dry cliffs and ledges. On bark it is a member of the Radula-Frullania-Porella Associule, usual- ly associated with Radula complanata, F. eboracensis or brittoniae (occasionally bolan- deri), and more rarely Lejeunea cavifolia. On rock-walls it occurs either in large mats by itself, or is associated with Radula complanata (more rarely R. obconica), Frullania riparia, occasionally Lejeunea cavifolia. The species occurs indifferently on both sedi- mentary rocks (sandstones, dolomites, shales) and igneous rocks, on both somewhat acid and basic types. The chief requirements are rather exposed sites and not too constant moisture conditions. The very large size (with the shoot mostly about 4 mm wide), the irregularly bi- pinnate plants up to 8 cm long, the olive-green dull color, and imbricate, incubous- appearing leaves are diagnostic of this species. The large, entire, longly decurrent under- * P. pinnata becomes as ubiquitous in the deep south, as it is, restricted and rare in occurrence in the upper midwest. In the south it occurs as a xerophyte on dry rocks, far from any source of constant water (often with P. platyphylloidea, Radula complanatd and obconica, Metzgeria furcata). It is particularly common on Taxodium knees and trunks, but may also occur on the bark of beeches, together with Frullania squarrosa and other corticolous xerophytes. It seems probable our northern P. pinnata represents only one series of closely related genotypes of a larger and diverse series occurring nearer the center of distribution. f See preceding footnote.</page><page sequence="296">552 TIIE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) leaves (P1. 68:4) and similarly shaped ventral lobes will at once separate it from all forms but the P. platyphylla.

PORELLA PLATYPHYLLA (L.) Lindb. P1. 68:1-3 Distribution much like P. platyphylloidea, but distinctly less common in most of the Eastern United States. In Minnesota found throughout the forested parts of the state, and often apparently nearly as frequent as platyphylloidea. Since the occurrence and ecology of the species is, as far as we know today, identical with that of platyphyl- loidea, it need not be treated here. The species is generally less robust and more regularly pinnately branched than platyphylla, and has the main stem leaves distinctly ovate and longer than wide (P1. 68:2).* When viewed ventrally, the narrower ventral lobes (never as wide as the under- leaves, often very distinctly narrower), which taper distinctly towards their apices, are characteristic (P1. 68:1, 2). When fertile, the distantly ciliate perianth mouth and uni- formly 2-spiral elaters are the most important characters that serve to separate it from the very similar platyphylloidea; these characters are more constant and valid than the vegetative characters. Occasional sterile plants of this species cannot be clearly separated from platyphyl- loidea. If a sterile plant shows the ventral lobes little more than one half as wide as the underleaves, has the dorsal lobes slightly longer than wide and ovate in shape, and has the ventral base of the dorsal lobe plane or little undulate, then it can usually be safely referred to platyphylla. Many plants are found that show some of the characters of platyphylla, some of platyphylloidea. These cannot be certainly named unless perianths and elaters are available for study.j Distribution.-AITKIN: Aitkin, Sheldon 2533. CASS: Leech Lake, Cox; Minnesota I., Leech Lake, MacM.

R. ob cnica RADULA COMPLANATA (L.) Dumort. PI. 69:2-3 Widely distributed throughout the eastern half of North America, throughout the forested region, from the Tropics to the Tundra. In Minnesota, rare south of the Conif- erous Region, perhaps largely because of the low rainfall (hence great intermittency of moisture in the xeric sites frequented by the species). Away from the Coniferous Region, the species occurs very largely in swamps and bogs, where the humidity is higher than in surrounding regions. The species is a xerophyte (though not nearly as extreme a one as most of our species of Frullania), and, occurs, either on bark or on the vertical faces of rocks and cliffs, as a pioner, as a member of the Raduld-Frullania-Porella Associule.t The species has a decidedly greater tolerance for xeric conditions than the related R. obconica, and occurs usually in more strongly insolated sites, where evaporation is higher. Although not always a calciphyte, the occurrence, such as in calcareous bogs, where it is abundant on the bark of Thuya, and on basic rocks, is usually under calcareous or sub- calcareous conditions, where the pH is above 5.5. This species is very easily recognized: it has an intermediate size between the very large Porella and the smaller Lejeuneaceae and Frullaniaceae, with leafy shoots usually 2-2.5 mm wide. The yellow-green color and incubously imbricate leaves are characteristic, while the generally present flattened, elongate, truncate-mouthed perianths are almost diagnostic (P1. 69:2). These characters are shared largely with the next species, from which it differs in being almost constantly fertile (with the concave male bracts below the * The only other local genus with a lobule and without underleaves is the genus Cololejeunea, including minute species with narrow, tapering leaves bearing coarse, papil- lose protuberances. t Together with Frullania asagrayana (occasionally bolanderi), Porella platyphyl- loidea and platyphylla, and occasionally Lejeunea cavifolia, on cliffs; with F. eboracentsis, oakesiana, brittonia, bolanderi, inflata and Porella on bark.</page><page sequence="299">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 555 perianth), and in having marginal gemmae present on at least some leaves in every patch (while none of the stems appear denuded because of the "dehiscence" of leaves).

PI. 69:1 Widely distributed, much like R. complanata, but of much sparser distribution in nmost of the Coniferous Region. In Minnesota the species appears limited to the Conifer- ous Region, however, because of the higher rainfall there, together with the lower evapora- tion rate (due to the lower summer temperatures). The species has a similar ecological distribution as R. complanata, but occurs under more mesic conditions (therefore almost never on bark in our area). On rock surfaces it is confined to more humid, sheltered cliffs, where it does not occur as a member of the typical Radula-Frullania-Porella Asso- ciule, but in a Lejeunea-Cololejeunea-Radula obconica facies. The species, like its con- gener, is a pioneer species, and appears unable to tolerate the competition of other species: therefore it usually forms nearly pure patches. The species is superficially very much like R. com planata. It is, however, usually sterile (since it is generally dioecious), and usually has distinctly less imbricate leaves, many of which are caducous (giving older parts of the stem a denuded appearance) (P1. 69:1): it totally lacks gemmae. This, together with the occurrence under more mesic conditions, are enough to identify it.

Their identification therefore offers no special problem. The Lejeuneaceae agree with the next family (the Frullaniaceae) in that the leaves appear incubous, but with a ventral inflated lobule, hidden from view above. The lobule in the Lejeuneaceae, however, has its longer axis parallel to the posterior leaf-margin (P1. 69:4, 8), and is at an angle with the stem. The most obvious character by which the two families can be separated in the field is by the color: the regional Lejeuneaceae are generally a bright yellow green or whitish green (like the Radulaceae), while the Frul- laniaceae range from deep green to reddish-brown. In the local Lejeuneaceae the perianth is also terete and 5-plicate (P1. 69:8). The color and incubous dorsal lobes might lead one to confuse the Le-</page><page sequence="300">556 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) jeunaceae with the Radulaceae.

Lindb. P1. 69:7, 8 Widely distributed throughout the Austral and Canadian Zones (i.e., from the Subtropical Region northward to the upper edge of the Coniferous Forest Zone), and frequently rather common. The species, in Minnesota, occurs chiefly along the eastern edge of the state, and strangely enough, is not known as yet, south of the North Shore region. This species, together with others of its family and the Frullaniaceae, is a pioneer species. It invades bare, unprepared rock faces where the sun is not too direct, or invades their crevices, and invades the bark of living trees. It is here a member of the typical Lejeunea-Frullania-Radula epipetric or corticolous associule. With the develop- ment of any amount of soil, the species is soon succeeded by other, more mesic forms. Although a xerophyte, the species is not nearly as extreme a xerophyte as Frultania and Porella; it therefore occurs with these only at the mesic extreme of the latter species. In our area it occurs nearly entirely on shaded, north or northwest facing cliffs, rather often with Radula complanata and Frullania asagrayana. The species is also occasional on the bark of Thuya in deep, shaded humid swamps, with F. bolanderi, etc., and Radula. Though not a pronounced calciphile, the species may be somewhat restricted by the dependency on at least traces of lime: in our area, at least, the species never occurs on bark in acid swamps, but occasionally in madl bogs, where the bark has a relatively high concentration of CaCO3. The size of this species is intermediate between Radula and Cololejeunea: with the width of the plant about 0.7-1.25 mm. This, alone, is usually enough to identify it (together with the yellow-green color and the rounded dorsal lobes). Under the micro- scope the presence of bilobed underleaves (P1. 69:7-8), together with the color, are diagnostic. Distribution.-CARLTON: Carlton, C 674.

In Minne- sota not yet known from south of the central part of the state, but rather frequent northward. Like Lejeunea, with which Cololejeunea frequently occurs, the species is a pioneer on vertical, rather sheltered and usually strongly shaded, slightly moist or rather dry cliffs, in places where the humidity is usually rather high. It also occurs in calcare- ous bogs, on the bark of Thuya, occasionally with such species as Frullania bolanderi and oakesiana, and Radula complanata. The measured pH is at 5.4 and higher. The species is usually to be recognized in the field by the very minute size: forming thin, inconspicuous yellowish-green overgrowths, usually in small patches, over shaded</page><page sequence="302">558 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) rocks and tree-trunks.* The beginner will probably at first overlook it because of the small size. Under the microscope it differs at once from all other genera with a ventrally incurved lobule (except Rddula) in lacking all trace of underleaves, as well as by the very obviously coarsely papillose cuticle (P1. 69:4, 6); the cuticular protuberances being formed by the conically elevated outer wall of the cells.

Family FRULLANIACEAE This family includes species of very characteristic appearance, always occur- ring as pioneers on bark, or dry rocks.t As in the Lejeuneaceae, there is a generally inflated ventral lobe, which, however, is usually more or less helmet- shaped or galeate (Pls. 70:2, 9; 71:7) and is parallel to the stem, and quite distant from the latter, being connected to it only by a small stalk (Pls. 70:2; 71:7-8). The small ventral lobe, lying free from the stem, is abso- lutely characteristic of the members of the family. Unlike the related Le- jeuneaceae, the perianth (which is often present), is flattened and more or less trigonous (with frequent development of supplementary keels, Pls. 70:9; 71:1, 9; 72:10). The species also differ from the Lejeuneaceae markedly in color: plants occurring on wet rocks or in shaded, sheltered places are usually deep green, while those of exposed places are almost always reddish-brown. Only two genera are known, of which Jubula, with pointed dorsal lobes, occurs on wet or dripping rocks, while the species of Frullania are xerophytes, occurring on dry rocks or bark.

P1. 70:1-3 This very handsome species occurs as a frequent pioneer throughout much of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone, usually on dry, shaded northwest or north facing cliffs, but occasionally on bark of birch. Elsewhere it occurs into the Deciduous Zone, but appar- ently it is quite absent from this zone in Minnesota. This species is very commonly isolated in occurrence, except for association with lichens and is found under extremely xeric conditions. Very occasionally it is found together with Radula complanata, and even more rarely so with epipetric populations of F. bolanderi. The species has a low pH preferendum, though it may occur on subcal- careous rocks; measured pH centers about 4.8. This is one of our easiest Hepaticae to learn to recognize in the field: its shoots are considerably wider (mostly 0.9-1.5 mm wide) than in most of our other species of Frullania, and it is always uniformly reddish-purple or copper-red in color, often becom. ing quite dark and blackish-purple when dry; the cuticle is characteristically glistening. It usually forms considerable patches on northwest facing dry cliffs: often a foot or more in extent, which are in obvious competition with grayish crustose lichens, occasionally growing with Grimmia and F. bolanderi. Under the microscope the line of larger dis- colored cells running obliquely through the basal half or more of most large lobes is characteristic (P1. 70:1, 3); this separates it from our other species except the very minute selwyiana, which usually occurs on the bark of White Cedar. It is also usually sterile, atn the plants are dioecious, while selwyniana is usually fertile, and the plants are autoecious. Distribution.-CARLTON: Carlton, C 957; Thompson, C 1161.

FRULLANIA INFLATA Gottsche Fig. 6:3, 4 The present species occurs both on bark and on cliffs, and is found widely distributed, from the Subtropical Zone to the lower part of the Subarctic-Subalpine. The species. however, becomes very scarce to rare in the northern part of its range, and is distributed in Minnesota very largely in the deciduous region, though it extends north as far as Grand Marais. Commonly associated is F. eboracensis, occasionally F. bolanderi. Like the related species of the genus, the present form is xerophile, though less extremeI,v so than F. asagrayana. It is not rare in the Elm Floodplain forests, on bark, and fruits there quite frequently. The species, like others of its genus, is a decided pioneer. Although nearly indistinguishable in the field, it can often be recognized with a strong hand lens by the tact that many of the ventral lobes (lobules) are not inflated, but form small lVingulate, explanate lobes. Such lobes, in our species, occur again only in F. riparia, a species largely limited to calcareous, rather exposed rocks. F. riparia, how- ever, is a sqmewhat larger species, mostly 1.2-2 mm broad (as against a normal width of 0.8-1.2 mm in inflata), and has the ventral lobules much larger and more elongate, and has much larger, broader underleaves. Many plants of F. inflata, however, have almost uniformly inflated lobules.</page><page sequence="306">562 TIHE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) Under the microscope, the lack of ocelli separates the species at once from the reddish-purple asagrayana and selwyniana, while the autoecious inflorescence and the non-cordate basal part of the dorsal lobe separate it from other related species (includ- ing riparia), except for the rare, northern F. oakesiana. It differs from oakesiana, how- ever, by the fact that the lobules are often in large part explanate and are then only 30. PLATE 70. Frullania asagTayana.-I. Sterile shoot, ventral view. 2.

Our local material is also characterized by the leaf-cells, which have nearly equal walls, with only very small trigones and no inter- mediary thickenings. The oil-bodies also serve to separate the two species: in inflata (and saxicola) they are rather numerous and occur 4-6 and up to 10-16 per cell in the median cells of the lobe; in occasional or many cells they furthermore have a character- istic linear or narrowly elliptical shape, and then are 5.4-8 x 1.3-1.8 tj in size. Such linear oil-bodies do not occur in all cells, many having largely ovoidi oil-bodies (3.2-4 x 1.5-2 ,u). Similar oil-bodies have not been observed in any of our other species of the F. riparia-squarrosa complex, in which there are circular to ovoid oil-bodies that occur mostly 5-7 per cell, never more than 9 per cell. F. inflata agrees with the related saxicola and oakesiana in rarely (and apparently never locally) producing intermediate thickenings of the cell-walls. It furthermore usually produces only relatively small trigones. This feature is of some aid in separating sterile and fragmentary material. Distribution.-CARLTO N: Carlton, C 995; Thompson, C 2151.

P1. 71:1-4 This doubtfully distinct species appears to have a scattered distribution in Minnesota, probably ranging throughout most of the eastern half of the state. The species has been previously reported only from the eastern United States (from Connecticut to Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama). The species, as the name implies, occurs on rocks, and has apparently been found only on ledges and rock-faces. This is its typical habitat in Minnesota. It is possibly only a form or variant of the more ubiquitous F. inflata, which has a wide distribution, over the bark of numerous deciduous trees and occasionally on rock-faces. F. saxicoila is extremely close to inflata, and inseparable from it in the field, or with a hand-lens. Under the microscope, the shorter beak of saxicola, slightly flaring at the niouth, with the opening completely closed by numerous clavate, hyaline papillose cells (P1. 71:1-3) distinguishes. the species from all other local species of Frullania, including inflata. In addition, there are other minor differences that separate the species from in- flata: the perianth, as in the related oakesiana is not obcordate or as strongly obovate: it reaches its maximum width near the middle (P1. 71:1), and does not become perceptibly broader beyond (remaining subparallel), while it is less swiftly contracted distally than in inflata, and is therefore not truncate. In inflata the perianth generally becomes gradu- ally broader to within ? from its apex, then is swiftly rounded into the broadly truncate apex (excepting the slender beak). In all material I have seen of saxicola all or almost all lobules are explanate (P1. 71:1, 4); in most material I have seen of inflata at least part of the lobules are inflated (i.e., galeate).* Distribution.-HoUSTON: 3 mi. s. of La Crescent, S 13540 (Plate).

WA- BASHA: Over dry rock face, 2 mi. n. of Reads Landing, S 18031. * Frye and Clark consider saxicola as a synonym of inflata and believe there may be some correlation between greater evaporation and development of papilloid cells of the perianth-mouth. If such were the case, one would also expect a correlation between greater evaporation and development of galeate lobules. Hence one would expect saxi- cola (with strong development of papilloid cells of perianth-mouth) to show better devel. oped galeate lobules than inflata. Since the opposite appears to hold, I believe that saxiccla can scarcely be explained away as a mere xeromorphic modification of inflata. Experimental work here is badly needed.</page><page sequence="308">564 THIE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) &lt;1 8. 9. '' o . ig-f go10. PLATE 71. Frullania saxicola.-1. Fertile plant. 2.

P1. 72:5-8 On the bark of Thuya, occasionally other trees, in the swamps and bogs of the northernmost part of the state, and occasionally in the ravines, occurs this small, distinc- tive species of Frullania. Like its congeners, it is a pioneer, but usually on the bark of shaded trees in moist, sheltered places where the atmospheric humidity is relatively high. The species is northern, and is extremely rare south of the main body of the Subarctic- subalpine zone, while it is totally unknown in the Tundra Region. The species appears to be nowhere common. Associated occasionally are other species of Frullania (chiefly bolanderi), and such species as Radula complanata, Cololejeunea biddlecomiae and Lejeunea cavifolia. This species agrees with F. asagrayana in having an oblique group or short line of discolored cells (ocelli) traversing the dorsal lobes of the leaves (P1. 72:8), in the narrow, elongate, galeate lobules (P1. 72:5), as well as in the purplish color and glossi- ness, and in the blunt leaves; it differs in these characters from all our other species of the genus. The most obvious difference from F. asagrayana lies in the very small size: the shoots are less to scarcely 1 mm wide. Furthermore, the present plant is often fertile, the inflorescence being autoecious (P1. 72:5), with the female bracts strongly dentate or spinose (P1. 72:5, 6-7). In asagrayana the plants are most often sterile, and the inflores. cence is dioecious, with the female bracts nearly entire-margined. The dentate margins of the female bracts separate the species from all our other Frullaniae. Distribution.-COOK: Lutsen, C 1140, C 1133. LAKE: Two Island River, C 2506, C 2611. FRULLANIA BOLANDERI Aust. P1. 72: 1-4 This species, originally described from California, is widely distributed throughout most of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone of Minnesota (and neighboring states), but has been nearly unknown from the Deciduous Zone (except for a single station in Iowa). Northward the species usually occurs on the bark of Thbuya, Fir, or Paper Birch. I have found it to be frequent as well on the bark of trees, such as Linden along creeks, and on Elm in the Flood-plain Forests. In addition it is common on the bark of ash and red oak (Quercus borealis) in the open, sunny hardwood forests covering the crests of bluffs (as at Whitewater State Park). It is commonly described as occurring only on bark, though Steere records a single case of the species occurring on rocks. In Minnesota I have found it frequent on rocks on Oak Island, at Black Bay, and on the Susie Islands. The species is a pioneer on both substrates, and is a well defined xerophyte, though rarely, apparently, occurring under as extremely xeric conditions as asagrayana locally prefers. On rocks (as at Belle Rose Island) it may, however, occur intermingled with asagrayana. The species is one of the easiest of local Hepaticae to "spot," even with the naked eye. In the field the erect or suberect flagelliform shoots, giving a worm-like appearance to the naked eye, usually occur in myriads, often making the mats of the species look like soft brushes (P1. 72:1, 3); such stiff and arcuate slender shoots, devoid of all but under- leaves (the leaves are caducous and leave merely a scar where they were attached) do not occur in any of our other species in the genus. The species is dioecious, and the perianths or male inflorescences appear to be very rare; in thousands of plants examined from Minnesota no infloroescences were found. It differs from our other dioecious species of the subgenus Trachycolea in that the dorsal lobe is not at all cordate at base (P1. 72:1, 3). Normally-leaved shoots of this species closely resemble F. oakesiana in the form of the tnderleaves and in the relatively large, inflated lobules (P1. 72:4). Such shoots can be told from oakesiana (and most of our other species of Trachycolea) by the relatively distinct styli (P1. 72:2), which are mostly 4-5 cells wide at base and triangular to lanceolate (in our other species generaly mnerely cilia a single cell or at most 2-3 cells wide near the base).</page><page sequence="310">566 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) The oil-bodies are also a valuable separating feature that will distinguish bolanderi from oakesiana. They are small, circular to short-ovoid, and merely 2.2-3.5 (rarely to 4) pu in diameter, and occur mostly 7-9 per median leaf-cell; they are nearly hidden by the much larger chloroplasts, which are 3.8-4.5-5.4 ,u in diameter. F. bolanderi therefore differs from oakesiana in the smaller but more numerous oil-bodies. In the distantly J.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~7 PLATE 72. Frullania bolanderi.- 1.

The relatively numerous oil-bodies per cell (and the fact that they are, on the average, only half the diameter of the chloroplasts) also separate F. bolanderi from F. eboracensis. In F. eboracensis there are mostly 3-4 oil-bodies per cell that are 3-4 x 3.5-6 t, and which average subequal in size to the chloroplasts. F. bolanderi also quite lacks intermediate thickenings and has small to moderate trigones in the leaf-cells; in F. eboracensis bulging trigones and intermediate thickenings occur abundantly.

P1. 70:4-10 On the bark of trees, often Thuya, occasionally Betula papyrifera, most often in swamps, occasionally in the foggy forests bordering Lake Superior, occurs the present, rather rare, very small species of Frullania. The species is more strictly subarctic-subalpine than any other Frullania (except selwyniana) in our region, and there are virtually no stations for it from the Deciduous Zone.* Its distribution usually coincides very closely with that of the White Cedar Swamps, most of the stations for the species from the midwest coming from such situations. In the east the species occurs in the upper part of the Coniferous Forest Region (i.e., the "Hudsonian" Zone), in the mountains. Associated species are often Cololejeunea biddlecomiae, Lejeunea cavifolia, Radula complanata, occa- sionally Frullania selwyniana and bolanderi. Like the latter two species, F. oakesiana is a pioneer on bark and a xerophyte, with the xerophily not strongly marked, and a decided preference for regions with high humidity, such as swamps. The species is very delicate and small, and therefore is not likely to be mistaken for such species as eboracensis, bolanderi, etc. On account of the size it may be mistaken for selwyniana (which of course has the lobes with a short group of ocelli, unlike the present species). From all of our species it differs at once in that the galeate ventral lobules are extremely large for the size of the plant, being about 3/5 - 4/5 the size of the dorsal lobes (P1. 70:9). In the truncate base of the dorsal lobes (P1. 70:4) and the autoecious inflorescence (P1. 70:9), as well as the nearly evenly thick or thin walls of the cells (P1. 70:6), and the short, broad beak of the nerianth (P1. 70:9), the present species agrees closely with F. inflata. The latter usually forms dense mats, is larger, usually green, and often has all or most of the very small ventral lobules expla- nate (P1. 71:1). Under the microscope the large size of the ventral lobule is alone enough to identify the present species. The oil-bodies of this species also are rather typical: they occur merely 3-4 per cell (P1. 70:6), and are mostly short-ovate to short- elliptical. In the related inflata-saxicola complex, the oil-bodies sometimes occur to 10-16 per cell in the median leaf-cells, and are nearly linear in many cells. Distribution.-CARLTON: Carlton, C 661, C 956.

FRULLANIA RIPARIA Hampe P1. 71:5-8 This species occurs widely distributed on the calcareous sandstones and limestones of the southeastern third of Minnesota; it does not extend into the Coniferous Biome, at least in Minnesota. In our region it is usually a pioneer on shaded, not too dry rocks, occasionally on bark of Linden on bluffs. It is particularly common on the east-facing bluffs along the Mississippi River, in the region from Chisago County southward.* The species is also found on the bark of trees, though only exceptionally so in our region. This (and F. saxicola) is virtually the only species of Frullania that is uniformly epipetric in the deciduous region in the midwest. It is either "calciphilous" or has at least a strong tolerance for lime; five pH readings run from 6.0 to 6.9. The occurrence is quite characteristic, as well as the relatively large size (distinctly larger than the common eboracensis and mostly 1.2-1.8 mm wide), and the almost con- stantly dull or olive green color of the leaves, contrasted with the usually brownish stem. The species is unknown with mature perianths, and is almost constantly completely sterile. Under a strong hand lens the narrow, lingulate, explanate ventral lobules can be seen (P1. 71:8). These separate the species from all our other local species, except F. inflata. The present species, however, has the lobule much more elongate (3/5 or more as long as the lobe is wide), and is a much larger species, usually well over 1.2 mm wide. Under the microscope the cordate form of the base of the dorsal lobe (P1. 71:5), and the large trigones of the leaves, will separate the species from inflata. Other diagnostic features are the extremely large underleaves (P1. 71:6-8) of well-developed shoots (these 3-4 times as wide as the stem!) and the form of the inflated lobules: these are mostly distinctly wider than long (in all our other species as long or longer than wide) (P1. 71:7). The inflated lobules are also strongly compressed in their middle, near their mouth (which is therefore almost closed). On some plants all or almost all of the lobules are inflated, and such plants are extremely difficult to separate from F. squarrosa. It is possi- ble, indeed, that F. squarrosa is merely a xeromorphic extreme or ecotype of F. riparia. The androecia of this species have been seen in material of the form with inflated lobules (from Wacouta, S 18014); they form, when well developed, parallel-sided, compact spikes: much as in F. eboracensis, unlike F. inflata (which has more or less globose, short androecia). I have also seen a single nearly mature perianth on the mate- rial from Wacouta; this is provided with three ventral keels, as well as the two lateral ones normally present, and the keels are more or less tuberculate; the perianth-beak is very long and slender. The perianths of this species had not been previously described, and are much as described for F. squarrosa (but appear to have a longer beak, as well as more ventral folds). They agree with the perianths of F. squarrosa in that the keels are distinctly tuberculate: the perianths thus being distinctly roughened. The cells of this species usually have rather distinct to somewhat bulging trigones, but rarely or never intermediate thickenings of the cell-wall; the related squarrosa normal- ly shows bulging trigones and many intermediate thickenings. The oil-bodies of this species are an important separating feature; they occur mostly 5-7 (rarely 4 or 9) per cell, and are ovoid or less frequently circular; they are usually 3.5-3.8 ,u (when circular) to 3.6 x 5.5 to 4 ,u x 9 ,u (when ovoid), and composed of very many, small protuberant globules-thus appearing somewhat papillose. The larger maximal size of the individual oil-body, and the fewer oil-bodies per cell, at once separate riparia (and the related squarrosa) from F. inflata and saxicola. * Here it forms the matrix in which the ferns Pellaea glabella, Camptosaurus rhi- zophyllus, and Cheilanthes feei undergo ecesis.</page><page sequence="313">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 569 Distribution.-CHISAGO: St. Croix Falls, H; Taylors Falls, H.

FRULLANIA S'QUARROSA (R., BL. N.) Dumort. P1. 72:11 This cosmopolitan and widely distributed species has an essentially southern range, occurring northward in the Mississippi Valley to northeastern Iowa (see Conard, 1945). Typical material of it has not yet been found in Minnesota, but it should be found in the "Driftless Area" in the southeastern part of the state. It occurs, almost indiscrimi- nately, over the dry, exposed bark of trees, and over sunny, dry rock faces. F. squarrosa is, in the writer's opinion, only difficultly separable from F. riparia.* When well-developed it differs at once from riparia (and all our other species of Frul. ldnia) in that 1. the leaves are strongly squarrose, standing away from the stem, when moist; when dry they are sometimes more or less involute and "wrapped" about the stern; 2. the underleaves are imbricate, and extremely large (P1. 72:11 ). Unlike typical riparia, the cells have large trigones and conspicuous thickenings of the cell-walls between the trigones (intermediate thickenings). The plants are imbricate-leaved, are almost constantly partly red-brown, and are relatively large: mostly 1.2-1.8 mm wide on mature shoots. Distribution.-WABASHA: Bluff 1 mi. s. of Lake City, S 13513, represents an inter- mediate type, between F. squarrosa and riparia. No typical material of squarrosa is known from Minnesota. FRULLANIA EBORACENSIS Gottsche P1. 71:9-10 Throughout the entire forested region of Minnesota this is one of the most abundant Hepaticae. It occurs most often on deciduous trees, but is common on Thuya and other conifers on occasion. The species is essentially a temperate zone form, and becomes distinctly scarcer as the upper part of the subarctic-subalpine zone is reached. In our region it is nearly always a pioneer on bark of living trees, but it is occasional on bare rock surfaces as well (as at Black Bay, Koochiching Co., with F. bolanderi). Commonly or occasionally associated species are two other Frullaniae: F. inflata and F. bolanderi, * I have studied a long series of specimens of the complex. Some of the extraterri- torial material of squarrosa has very strongly squarrose leaves, and has extremely large underleaves, 4-5 times as wide as the stem; this material is often fertile and frequently produces sporophytes. A specimen of this type from Kiushiu, Japan (Hep. Jap. No. 28) is before me. Plate 72, Fig. 11, illustrates a similar plant. The Iowa material referred to squarrosa by Conard (of which I have seen material, through the courtesy of Dr. Conard), stands nearly midway between this strongly squarrose, dense-leaved extreme, and the non-squarrose, lax-leaved riparia extreme; it should perhaps be referred, at least in part to riparia. I have also studied a series of Texan specimens (leg. Eula Whitehouse), which shows all kinds of gradation from strongly squarrose red-brown extremes to more lax-leaved, green, scarcely patent-leaved extremes. Where a break into two species should be attempted is, thus far, difficult to decide. The riparia extreme appears to be a relatively mesic form: it shows small to moder- ate trigones but no intermediate thickenings, largely or frequently explanate lobules, lax leaves and distant to approximate underleaves; it is furthermore green to slightly bronzed in color. This suggests that perhaps squarrosa represents the xeric extreme, and riparia thle mesic extreme of a single species.</page><page sequence="314">570 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) both of which are also frequent along the rivers of the southern part of the state, on the bark of flood-plain trees (river maple, elm, etc.). Like its congeners, the species is a xerophyte and can stand considerable exposure, occurring more often with lichens than with other Hepaticae; it is, however, more common on the north-facing sides of trees, where insolation and desiccation are not as pronounced, occurring there quite commonly with Radula com planata. The species is the commonest Frullania in Minnesota. It is difficult to separate only from F. brittoniae when sterile, but may also be confused with F. inflata. It differs from itflata in the nearly constantly inflated lobules, the dioecious inflorescence, and the cordate dorsal base of the leaf (at least of large mature leaves) (P1. 71:10). The differences from brittoniae lie chiefly in the perianth-form: in northern forms of ebora- censis the perianth is typically smooth or provided with few tubercles (P1. 71:9); in brittoniae supplementary ridges occur and the perianth bears numerous tubercles and is quite rough (P1. 72:10). The lobule in eboracensis is inflated almost uniformly, and is not or slightly compressed below (near mouth) (P1. 71:9); in brittoniae the lobule is inflated near its apex, but strongly compressed below (P1. 72:9). Finally, the under- leaves in eboracensis are entire or occasionally bear a single lateral tooth (P1. 71:9); in brittoniae the upper halves of most of the underleaves are distinctly dentate or crenate (PI. 72:9). The above three species (and the related F. bolanderi) agree in their general size (0.6-1.2 mm wide), and general facies; the species are also usually generally brownish or reddish-brown and quite dull (but inflata is usually green), unlike F. asa- grayana and selwyniana. In the southeastern part of the state material with caducous leaves (often appearinig almost totally denuded of vegetative leaves) occurs rather frequently. Such plants might be confused with F. bolanderi, but in the latter species the caducous leaves are limited to erect, specialized branches, obviously different from the rest of the plant, while in eboracensis there is no dimorphism of the shoots into caducous and non-caducous portions. F. eboracensis further differs from bolanderi in the cordate bases of large, well-developed leaves, and in the minute styli (which are merely 1 or at most 2 cells wide and filiform) (P1. 71:9).

It is much more uncom- mon than eboracensis, to which it is closely related. Like eboracensis it is primarily a pioneer invading species of the bark of deciduous trees, such as oak, birch, elm, etc. To my knowledge the species rarely invades rock surfaces. F. brittoniae is very close to eboracensis: the sterile plants are often difficult to sepa- rate, but can be generally recognized by the wider than long mature underleaves (PI. 72 :9), whose lateral margins are almost uniformly dentate or crenate-dentate. The lobules are also slightly different, and are inflated primarily in the upper and outer portions (P1. 72 :9). When fertile, the perianths are typical: they have longer, more slender beaks than in eboracensis (P1. 72:10), and are strongly tuberculate usually, and provided with supplementary keels (in addition to the normal three keels). Confusion under the microscope with other species is unlikely: the species is moderately large, and could be confused with inflata, but lacks the explanate lobules of the latter. The absence of caducous-leaved flagellae at once eliminates it from confusion with the occasionally associated bolanderi, which is of nearly equal size. Distribution.-AITKIN: Pine Lake, C 1247.

ORDER METZGERIALES The members of this order are all thallose (except for Fossombronia). They have been included as a suborder (Metzgerinae), of the Jungerman- niales, but differ from that group in several fundamental ways: 1. The cells are never collenchymatous (Pls. 73:6; 75:1; 76:8-9; 77:5). 2. The plants do not show origin from a triseriate ancestral type; when ventral appendages occur, these are never found as a median row, but occur as scattered stalked papilla (Pl. 75:2) or as a pair of rows of well-developed ventral scales (P1. 75:4); generally there are no ventral appendages, and rarely lateral append- ages (P1. 73:5, 10). 3. The spores are uniformly larger than in the Junger- manniales, and vary mostly from 35 [k and 1-celled (Pls. 73:2-3, 8; 75:9) to several celled and up to 100 [u long (P1. 74:8). 4. The archegonia are formed behind the apical cell, hence the plants grow indefinitely even after their production (P1. 74:4, 7). Th-erefore one often finds several archegonia (or arch-egonial groups) scattered along the dorsal surface of the plant. (Pls. 73: 5; 75: 10). Since the origin of the "leaf"-like appendages in the Metzgeriales is so different from the origin in the Jungermanniales (see Buch, 1930), and since it is impossible that the leafy Metzgeriales form a "link" between the Junger- manniales and thallose Metzgeriales, it seems best to separate the Metzger- iales as a distinct order. There are relatively few families and genera of Metzgeriales, and their identification is not so often bound up with difficulties, as is that of the Jun- germanniales. These may be identified by the following Key to Families, and by the subjoined key directly to genera (p. 572). KEY TO FAMILIES 1.

Fossombronia Family FOSSOMBRONIACEAE The members of this family agree with the Jungermanniales in that the gametophyte is leafy (P1. 73:5, 10): with a distinct stem and with the lateral wings of the 'thallus" divided into lamellae, forming distinct leaves. Unlike the Jungermanniales the archegonia are dorsal (P1. 73:5), not ter- minal; therefore the sporophytes are borne dorsally on the thallus, rather than at the apex of the shoot (P1. 73:4). The group differs from the Jun- * Riccardia pinguis may be sought here. Unlike other species of its genus it has a broad, nearly simple thallus (with scarcely any indication of a mid-rib). It is of a sitlim- lar size as Pellia, but differs from it at once in that the thallus is firmer, rather turgid and brittle and has a peculiar, fatty, luster. The plants also are a peculiar yellow-green. Under the microscope R. pinguis can be separated at once from any species of Pellid because of the absence of oil-bodies in its cells; in Pellia these are quite distinct.</page><page sequence="318">574 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) germanniales as well in that there is no distinct perianth, but there is a bell- shaped (campanulate) low, involucre, wide and open at the flaring mouth (P1. 73:9); furthermore, the celis are not collenchymatous, but very large and extremely thin-walled (P1. 73:6); finally, the spores are very large and I3 gonia. 6.

It will be seen that the group in many regards appears to stand intermediate between the Jungermanniales ("leafy" Hepaticae) and the thallose Metzgerinales, since it combines certain characters of both groups. However, the group lhas certaini peculiarities of its own that makes it impos- sible to consider it as a "connecting link": the capsule is not divided into four valves, but disintegrates irregularly, falling apart into pieces from the apex back; this does not occur in any other group of the Jungermanniales. The family Fossombroniaceae includes a single genus (Fossombronia) in our region.* The North American members of that genus differ at once from other forms with which they could be confused by the purplish color of the rhizoids. This pigmentation contrasts very strongly with the pure green color of the rest of the gametophyte. In a very few leafy forms (Jungerman- nia, Solenostoma) the rhizoids may be purplish; these have very regular leaves, while in Fossombronia the leaves are highly irregular: more or less rectangular wavy overgrowths, often very slightly lobed and crisped (P1. 73:5, 10). Furthermore, the dorsal position of the archegonia can usually be determined (P1. 73:5, 10), as well as the scattered dorsal, yellow, promi- nent antheridia (P1. 73:5). FOSSOMBRONIA Raddi The chief characters of the genus are: the division of the plant body into a stem and lateral leaf-like lamellae (P1. 73:5, 10); the large, thin-walled, green cells (P1. 73:6); the violet or purplish rhizoids; the dorsal antneridia and archegoilia: the former yellow, spherical bodies, usually found in June and July, the latter developing and forming sporophytes usually in summer and fall; sporophytes surrounded by a campaniulate involucre (P1. 73:9), consist- ing of a short, stout seta and a large globose capsule (P1. 73:4), which dehisces irregularly; spores large, mostly 35-50 ,u; elaters usually bispiral (P1. 73:1, 7). One species has recently been found in Minnesota, but one other may be found in our region; a third may evelntually be found here and is included in the key. The species are positively determinable only by means of the spores: therefore if material is found locally before September, it must be cultured until capsules form, or the site must be staked and the material collected at a later date. KEY TO SPECIES 1. Spores reticulate (PI. 73:2-3): the exine divided by ridges that cross and fuse to form polygonal areas; margins of spores appearing to have 12-20 teeth. (Usually under acid conditions in moory or sandy places.) - 2 * The genus Petalophyllum has been included in the Fossombroniaceae. It differs in a number of important characters from Fossombronia, however. In Petalophyllum the archegonia and antheridia are in groups (as in all other Metzgeriales, except Fossom- bronia); the capsule is 3-4 layered (2-layered in Femeawbronia), the apical cell has 3 cutting facies (2 in Fossombronia). In these rather fundamental characters Petalophyl- lum is quite distinct from Fossombronia and I would regard it as a representative of a separate family, the Petalophyllaceae.</page><page sequence="320">576 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 2.

(Usually on loamy or clayey, alkaline or neutral soil.) ----------------------------------------[F. wondraczekii] FOSSOMBRONIA FOVEOLATA Lindb. (_ F. dumortieri) P1. 73:1-6 The family Fossombroniaceae has been unreported for Minnesota. However, the present species appears to be moderately frequent, at least within the eastern borders of the state. The species is frequent elsewhere in eastern North America from the Conifer- ous Region south almost into the subtropics, and has a similarly wide range in Europe. In Minnesota the writer has collected the species northward from the Deciduous Zone (Ham Lake, Anoka Co.; St. Croix R., at St. Croix State Park) well into the Coniferous Zone. As is the case with other members of the family, F. foveolata is essentially a pioneer species, occurring usually on substrates that have not been previously colonized; as with the other species of Fossombronia that do not develop ventral tubers, the species is usual- ly a mesophyte, rarely a meso-hygrophyte, occurring only rarely in areas where it is subject to even the slightest degree of desiccation. Within the above limitations (e.g., iestriction to usually inorganic substrates, inability to compete, hence pioneer occurrences, and restrictions to essentially mesic environments) the species has a very wide ecological range in our region. Indeed, the species locally exhibits a wider range in occurrence than I have noted elsewhere in its range. It occurs frequently on moist alluvial soil and springy banks along rivers (as along the St. Croix), associated with such mesophytes and arenicoles as Pellia neesiana and epiphylla, Anthoceros laevis and macounii (at a pH of 4.8-5.6). Occasionally it occurs in moist rock-crevices along the edges of turbulent streams, in areas where it is subject to inundation during high water (as in the upper gorge of the Temperance River, and in a small creek at Lutsen); here it is associated either with Pellia epiphylla (Temperance R.) or with Solenostoma pumillum (near Lutsen). Occasionally the species occurs at the borders of lakes, as at Lax Lake (there around the roots of Spirea alba); sometimes around the peaty-sandy moors of acid lakes, such as that around Deer Lake, Baraga County, Michigan (there with Riccardia ?sinuata, 1'ellia neesiana, Odontoschisma elongatum, Cephalozia ?ambigua, and such vascular plants as Drosera, Xyris, Pogonia ophioglossoides, Eriocaulon, etc.* Under extreme conditions, the species may even occur in peat-bogs (as under the Chameadaphne heath in boggy lake between Copper Harbor and Eagle Harbor, Mich.) or in old peaty meadows, eco- logically "descended" from peat bogs (as at Ham Lake, Anoka Co., Minnesota: there with Pellia epiphylld, Lophozia capitata, Lophocolea bieterophylla, Sphagnum, Poly- trichum, and such vascular species as Calopogon, Xyris torta, Lycopodium inundatum, Chameadaphne, Vaccinium oxyococcus, Drosera rotundifolia and intermedia). Finally, the species may occur in moist roadside ditches (as 1-5 miles n. of Cook-Lake Co. line, Minn.), there with Pellia epiphylla, Riccardia multifida, various sedges, and Equisetum variegatum. It should be noted that the occurrences around peat-bogs are from substrates rich in organic material; such occurrences are quite atypical for species of Fossombronia. F. foveolata, being our only species of the genus, can only be confused with various leafy Jungermanniales. The purplish rhizoids, and almost uniformly transparent, pure- green color of the rest of the plant, will aid in its identification. Only a few of our * The occurrence under such sandy-peaty conditions appears more widespread. I have found F. foveolata near Lake Cowles, Mt. Katahdin, again with Odontoschisma elonga- tum and Cephalozia ambigua-bicuspidata intergrade (and with Cladopodiella francisci, Pellia ?epiphylla, Nardia geoscypha, etc.) under almost identical conditions.</page><page sequence="321">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 577 other leafy Hepaticae have purplish rhizoids (Solenostoma paroicum, S. crenuliformis, S. hyalinum); these agree in having orbicular leaves that are quite entire, and not at all wavy, with smaller cells that are more or less collenchymatous. In F. foveolata, as well as other species of Fossombronia, the leaves are essentially quadrate or broadly obcuneate- quadrate, wavy to strongly crispate, very irregular, giving the plants a characteristic appearance (P1. 73:5, 10); the cells are very large and very thin-walled (P1. 73:6) with no trace of trigones. The species can be identified only with mature capsules, which are borne dorsally on the stem-like axis (P1. 73:4) and are surrounded, until maturity, by a very characteristic, campanulate, open perichaetium or "pseudoperianth" (PI. 73:4). F. foveolata can be separated from all other species of the genus likely to be found in the general region by the reticulate spores (P1. 73:2-3) found in the same capsule with well-developed elaters (P1. 73:1).

This small species of Fossombronia has been reported in the general area from Illi- nois, Indiana and Michigan: it may yet be found westward into Minnesota. F. cristula appears very closely related to F. foveolata, of which it may be only a variety. It differs from it largely in being unable to develop well-developed elaters, such as always occur in foveolata (P1. 73:1). The species is most common, in moist sandy depressions, often in prairie habitats. FOSsOMBRONIA WONDRACZEKII (Corda) Dumort. Fig. 11:10-11; P1. 73 :7-10 This species is more widespread to our east, being perhaps the commonest species of the genus in New England. It occurs westward to Michigan, and may yet be found west into Minnesota. F. wondraczekii agrees with F. foveolata in general size of the plants, and in the presence of well-developed elaters (P1. 73:7); the pseudoperianth tends sometimes to be slightly more distinctly dentate at mouth (P1. 73 :9). The spores, however, are quite distinctive (P1. 73:8), bearing on the outer face a number of ridges, which occasionally fork dichotomously, but rarely if ever fuse to form areoles. The non-areolate spores are thlerefore the most obvious species characteristic of F. wondraczekii. There are old reports of F. pusilla from Ontario and elsewhere in eastern North America; these have been doubted by recent workers, almost certainly justifiably so. F. wondraczekii can be told from F. pusilla in that circa 28-32 of the teeth or ridges are visible around the spore-margin, while less than 20 of such ridges attain the spore- margin in pusilla. Family PELLIACEAE The local members of this family all belong to the genus Pellia. Thev are flat, rather membranous thallose forms, with broad thalli (about 4-8 mm wide), with a slight and obscurely indicated midrib, and a gradually thinner lamina on each side, that is not scalloped nor strongly undulate (P1. 74:7). When sterile, confusion is most likely with Riccardia pinguis (see distinction on p. 588), or with Pallavicinia. The latter genus, however, has a distinct sharply defined midrib that is provided with a strand of small cells that stand out as an opaque line when viewed in transmitted light (P1. 75:13); such a costal strand is absent in Pellia. When fertile, the fact that the antheridia occur singly, scattered over the</page><page sequence="322">578 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) dorsal thallus surface, anld protrude as pimple-like elevations, is quite charac- teristic.

All five of the species included below may eventually be found in the area under discussion. Krajina and Brayshaw (1951, p. 59) state that no "new species of this interesting genus has been distinguished . . since 1876. . . ." However, they obviously overlooked the high-boreal Pellia borealis Lorbeer (see treatment in Muller, 1940), which probably replaces much of P. epiphylla (of which it is a polyploid derivative) in the area north of us. P. columbiana Krajina and Brayshaw, though known only from British Columbia, may well have a wider distribution.

Corda P1. 74:8-10 Widely distributed, from the southern half of the Deciduous Region (Austral) to the upper edge of the Coniferous Region, and into the Tundra. In Minnesota, limited, because of its high moisture requirements, almost entirely to the northeastern half of the state. The species occurs under a large variety of conditions, both acid and subcal- careous, wherever there is a relatively constant supply of moisture and not too intense insolation. The species occurs generally in at least partly shaded sites, but occasionally grows in full sun, if moisture conditions are sufficiently high, and then forms a reddish- pigmented modification. The species occurs in Minnesota either on moist basic rocks (here with Fossombronia foveolata in crevices), or in peaty, wet depressions in peaty fields (here with F. foveolata, and with Drosera longifolid and rotundifolia), or at the edges of rather marly bogs under Thuya (with Lophozia rutheana, Riccardia pinguis, Chiloscyphus pallescens). Occurrences under such marly conditions are very exceptional, however, and the species is usually replaced by the more lime-tolerating P. fabbroniana under such conditions. In the ravines of the North Shore the species also occurs as a chasmophyte on moist basic rocks, together with Solenostoma pumillum, Scapania gym- nostomophila, Preissia, etc.: it is, under such conditions, often replaced by P. fabbroni- ana or neesiana. When sterile this species is very difficult to separate: it can often be identified by the rather flat thalli (never undulate like Moerkia), that are quite broad (8-10 or even 10-15 mm wide) and rather thin and dull green (never greasy and thick like Riccardia pinguis, and never bright green). Separation from sterile material of the other species of Pellia (except borealis) is extremely difficult. P. epiphylla differs from fabbroniana (but agrees with the others) in having the walls of the cells of the median part of the thallus with distinct thickenings. It differs from neesiana in the larger size, and in having merely a flap-like involucre (as in P1. 74:4). When fertile epiphylla is readily distinguished from all other species (except borealis) by the paroecious inflorescence: with the papillose protuberances under which the anthe- ridia occur situated in a group some distance behind the low, flap-like involucre (in which the sporophyte develops). The differences from borealis are cited in the key and under the latter.

It has been found, in Europe, to replace P. epiphylla, almost to the exclusion of the latter, in the northern countries. It appears to be limited in distribution to the Fir-Spruce Zone, and will probably be found on both continents: i.e., it is a Subarctic-subalpine species. The species has nearly or quite the same ecological requirements as the more southern, more common, P. epiphylla: a constant, adequate rather than abundant supply of moisture, not too extreme light conditions, and not highly calcareous substrates. Like all of our species of Pellia the species occurs most often on nearly humus-free, compact, inorganic, clayey or loamy-clayey soils, or thin soils in crevices of ravine-walls. Under the latter conditions, the more calciphilous P. fabbroniana very usually replaces both borealis and epiphylla. This species is very close to epiphylla, from which it cannot be separated in the field or under the binocular microscope. Under high magnification, the very large, more or less undulate cells of the edges of the thallus at once 'identify the species (even if sterile). The species is a polyploid with 18 chromosomes (twice the number of the very closely related epiphylla). Because the differences between borealis and epiphylla (i.e., the cell-size) are those to be expected between the typical and polyploid forms, and no morphological peculiarities separate the two, some workers have challenged the correctness of retaining borealis as a discrete species.] PELLIA NEESIANA (Gottsche) Limpr. Pls. 74:4-7; 75:1-2 This species is extremely similar to the commoner P. epiphylla and has somewhat the same distribution; however, it is somewhat more northern, being rare south of the lower edge of the Coniferous Forest Region. In Minnesota we know of a single site at the lower edge of the Coniferous Forest (St. Croix State Park). The species appears con- fined to the eastern border of the state, unlike the more ubiquitous P. epiphylla. P. neesiana occurs most frequently on moist soil along streams, associated here with Blasia, Pellia epiphylla, Phaeoceros laevis and A nthoceros macounii, occasionally Cono- cephdlum and Marchantia (as at St. Croix State Park): the pH of the substrate here varies from 5.5-6.8. Although the species is not a "calciphile," it occurs most frequently around circumneutral sites or over merely slightly acid substrates. The species occurs on moist river banks largely in areas where the ground is springy, or where there is seepage; it forms large, rather deep green patches here, usually associated with various grasses, Bidens, Aster, etc. that rather effectively shade the Pellia. This species is related very closely to P. epiphylla, sharing with it the following fea. tures: thalli about 8-10 mm wide, little undulate, in cross-section showing distinct stiffen- ing bands on the walls of the cells (these most evidenlt on staining hand-sections with carmine or other water-soluble dyes); involucres (perichetia) more or less flap-shaped, con- sisting of a large flap on the posterior side of the depression from which the calyptra emerges; mouth of involucre crenulate but never ciliate, appearing entire; calyptra usually distinctly exserted beyond mouth of involucre at maturity of sporophyte. The capsule in both species is identical: the inner wall normally has many complete or subcomplete annu- lar bands; the tuft of elater-bearers situated at the base of the capsule thick, 15-25 o in diameter, occurring only some 18-30 in number; the spores are mostly 80-100 ,u long. In all of these characteristics that neesiana shares with epiphylla, the species differs from P. fabbroniana. P. neesiana agrees with epiphylla also in being more robust and firm than fabbroni- ana; both species also show a tendency to develop reddish or purplish pigmentation along the costa (which may spread to the rest of the plant when growing in sunny, exposed sites). Completely sterile plants of neesiana can be separated from those of fabbroniana</page><page sequence="325">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 581 because of the presence of stiffening bands (really short spirals) of the walls of the cells of the thallus; such sterile plants are quite inseparable from P. epiphylla, however. When fertile, two features at once separate neesiana from epiphylla: the inflorescence in neesiana is dioecious; the involucre in neesiana, though more or less flap-shaped and short, forms a complete ring (though much reduced in height anteriorly). 1.? 2.

Such a plant is figured in longitudinal section in Plate 74, Fig. 4. However, such plants differ from epiphylla in being clearly dioecious, and always occur with more normal plants, showing a longitudinal section as in Plate 74, Fig. 5. I have also seen a single plant of true neesiana in which the capsule had the inner wall with nodular thickenings only (supposedly characteristic of fabbroniana only, in the genus); this appears to represent an abnormal extreme, since all other plants showed clearly numerous complete or sub- complete annular bands. P. neesiana therefore, in the perichaetia, occasionally can be confused with epiphylla, and in the thickenings of the inner wall of the capsule occa- sionally approaches fabbroniana.

Subclass MARCHANTIAE P1. 74:1-3 This appears to be the least frequent species of the genus in our region, and has the most restricted distribution: being known only from the Coniferous Zone. In Minnesota virtually confined to the ravines of the North Shore of Lake Superior, where it is fre- quent in crevices of basic rocks, such as diorite. The species is a decided calciphyte, occurring almost exclusively as an epipetric or chasmophytic species associated with moist, often dripping basic rocks. The pH in such sites centers about 7.0-8.0. The species is more hygrophytic, and usually occurs in more shaded, sheltered sites than our other two species of Pellia, though P. epiphylla occasion- ally frequents very similar chasmophytic sites (as at Manitou River). Commonly associated species are Scapania cuspiduligera, Solenostoma sphaerocarpum, Lophozia het- erocolpa and badensis, occasionally gillmani, and Scapania gymnostomophila. The calci- phytic species of the moss genus Gymnostomum are also very generally consociated with it. This is our most delicate species of the genus, with the thalli usually only 4-7, rarely on female plants 8-9 mm wide, and usually uniformly bright to deep green in color. The thallus shows no trace of thick "bands" (or spirals) in section (unlike in our other species). Like P. neesiana, fabbroniana is dioecious. The female plants, when bearing involucres, can be separated at once from the other two species of the genus, since the perichaetia are tubular structures, distinctly ciliate at the mouth (P1. 74:1-3); the calyp- tras are almost invariably included within the tubular perichaetia, quite unlike our other two species of the genus. When capsules are present, the absence of annular or semi- annular bands of the inner capsule wall (merely with delicate nodular thickenings) will separate the species from neesiana and epiphylla. The spores also average smaller (most- ly 60-75 At long), and the cluster of elater-bearers attached to the inner base of the capsule are much more slender (5-8 St thick) and more numerous (50-100 or even more) than in these two species. Finally, the much more restricted occurrence of this species should prove useful in its recognition, as well as the constant association with "calciphi- lous" Bryophytes.

Family BLASIACEAE BLASIA Micheli A single species, occasional in the eastern part of the state. The differ- entiating characters are given in the key, and under the species.</page><page sequence="327">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 583 BLASIA PUSILLA (L.) Micheli P1. 75:3-5 This species is widely distributed in the temperate zone, occurring chiefly in the northern part of the Deciduous Forest Region, less commonly in the Coniferous Region: it has an intermediate distribution, occurring rarely south of the "Upper Austral" Zone, and virtually not at all north of the "Canadian" Zone.* The species is usually associated with other pioneer species of denuded loamy or clayey banks, ditches, and paths, such as Anthoceros, Pellia, Riccardia pinguis, Cono- cephalum, and occasionally Notothylas. The chief requirements of the species are absence of dense shade (i.e., moderate or strong insolation), a rather constant supply of moisture (absence of intermittent moisture conditions), and an inorganic nutrient medium. The species occurs virtually without exceptiotn on areas that, for some reason, are pre- vented from following the normal paths of succession and are kept perpetually in an initial or subinitial state: such as loamy steep banks in springy places, where freezing in winter and heaving as well as sliding in spring prevent the succession of a herbaceous vegetation, or on old wagon roads or paths, where human disturbance keeps other vege- tation out. Away from this area, Fossombronia wondraczekii is a very commonly asso- ciated pioneer species, but in Minnesota the most commonly associated species is Riccardia pinguis. The species apparently prefers a circumneutral or slightly alkaline substrate: occurring quite commonly on loam over calcareous sandstones, and has a measured range of from pH 6.0-7.2. It may occasionally occur directly on moist sandstone, but this is exceptional. This is one of the easiest Hepaticae to learn to recognize in the field. It can be distin- guished with the naked eye, because of the scalloped thallus margins (P1. 75:5), near the base of which occurs scattered dark swellings (cavities in the thallus filled by a blue green alga, a species of Nostoc, occurring in symbiosis with the Blasia). The plants also usually grow in more or less distinct rosettes (since they branch very freely), and have the midrib distinctly indicated by a whitish line (said to be formed by Calcium oxalate). Blasia also differs in the very characteristic manner of production of many-celled gemmae (P1.75:3). One type is produced in flasks, near the thallus apex, that bear slender necks through which the gemmae are discharged; these bear oval gemmae. The other type of gemmae are star-shaped gemmae (P1. 75 :3), which are borne directly on the thallus surface. The genus also differs from our other Metzgeriales in the presence of distinct ventral scales (P1. 75:4), in two rows. Distribution.-COOK: Hat Point, Grand Portage, C 3124. GOODHUE: Red Wing, H20.

Family PALLAVICINIACEAE The members of this family are very similar, superficially, to the Pellia- ceae: they are rather large plants, mostly 4-5 mm wide or more, and of a rather deep, pure, translucent green color (much like coarse fern prothallia, as regards texture and color): they also are broadly strap-shaped or lingulate (P1.75:6, 10), with entire thallus margins (lacking dark spots): furthermore, they have a distinct midrib that is quite convex below, but gradually disap- pears into the thallus-wings, which gradually become thinner and one-layered towards the margins (P1. 75:11-13). In the Pallaviciniaceae the costa is usually more sharply distinct and * Recently reported from the Tundra by Schuster (1950).</page><page sequence="328">584 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) thicker than in Pellia, but otherwise tlle groups are very similar vegetatively. The Pallaviciniaceae, however, have the female involucres double: there is an outer ring of fringed, laciniate scales (P1. 75:10) appearing very early, much before the tubular inner involucre, which is never present in the Pelliaceae. Furthermore, the antheridia are also hidden under dorsal fringed scales (and not sunk in dorsal cavities, as in Pellia) (P1. 75:6-8). Finally, the capsule is quite different: in the Pallaviciniaceae it is cylindrical and elongate, and splits into 2 or imperfectly into 4 valves, and totally lacks the tuft of elater bearers present in the Pelliaceae. Two genera occur in our general region, only one of which has yet been found in Minnesota: KEY TO GENERA* 1.

It possibly may extend into the eastern edge of Minnesota. The speciks has decidedly different ecological requirements, compared to the related Moerkia, and its habitat will usually separate it alone. It is found (in the north) under quite to very acid conditions, in acid swamps or bogs associated with Sphagnum, Calypogeia sphagni- cola, Lophozia marchica, etc., or on decaying logs in such areas, associated with Cepha- lozia species, etc. In calcareous areas it is almost always limited to bogs and standing water, where the accumulation of peat has lowered the pH to below 5.0. The strap-shaped, nearly flat thalli (P1. 77:1), 2-5 cm long and 4-5 mm wide with the costa quite distinct, and under transmitted light exhibiting a distinct central strand of thick-walled, more opaque cells (P1. 75:13), are quite diagnostic. Unlike the next species, the thallus is usually nearly plane and very sparingly forked. MOERKIA Gottsche MOERKIA HIBERNICA Gottsche P1. 75:6-12 This handsome, very prominent species occurs scattered throughout much of the northern half of Minnesota. The species occurs most widely distributed in the Northern edge of the Deciduous Zone and southern part of the Coniferous Zone, but apparently does not get into the Deciduous Region in Minnesota. The southern edge of its distribu- tion coincides quite well with the southern edge of the range of the commonly associated White Cedar, Thuya occidentalis. Unlike the superficially somewhat similar Pallavicinia, Moerkia hibernica is a decided "calciphile," at least in North America. The species occurs in Minnesota only in Thuya swamps and bogs, where it is restricted in occurrence to the open depressions or their edges; here it is usually found at the margins of shallow pools, associated with Riccardia multifida, Chiloscyphus pallescens, Lophozia Xrutheana, Plagiochila asplenioides, Cono- c(phalum conicum, etc. Occasionally the species invades the sides of marly wet ditches * Constructed to separate local forms only.</page><page sequence="329">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 585 \}J \ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~. 4 .

The occurrence together with one or another species of Riccardia is extremely striking, and in my experience is always correlated with the occurrence of subcalcareous substrata. Associated with such a preference, there is a decided tendency to avoid non-mineral substrates (hence, in deep Thuya swamps, where the species tends to be very frequent, it must be looked for around wet holes, where marly soil occurs near or at the surface). Like the other Metzgeriales, Moerkia is a meso- hygrophyte, entirely unable to survive in areas with any considerable intermittency of moisture: it is therefore, away from swamps, restricted to soils of fine consistency, such as marly loam and clay, and in sheltered wet places, as around marl springs and in marly ditches. The pH range varies from a lower extreme (where the species was being crowded out by humicole secondary species) of 6.1 to 8.0. This is a very easy species to recognize in the field: the pure green, rather large, translucent thalli are usually rather freely branched and somewhat undulate and wavy, especially wherever they are crowded (P1. 75:10). The slightly to distinctly undulate&amp; crisped appearance at once separates the species from our other thallose forms, especially Riccardia pinguis (which may occur intermingled with it). It differs also from the latter in the less turgid and less fleshy, relatively dull and non-greasy appearance of the thalli, with the color never yellow-green. The species is more likely to be confused with Pellia (especially P. epiphylla, with which it may grow intermingled, as at Grand Portage). From this genus it differs in the presence of a more discrete, more or less triangular "vein" (P1. 75:11-12); in the pres- ence of the antheridia dorsal on the thallus, under small dentate scales (P1. 75:6-8); and in the fact that female plants produce a tall, tubular involucre, to 5-6 mm long or more, surrounded at the base by a shorter involucre formed of laciniate scales. Plants at the time of fertilization have not developed the tubular involucre, but already show a ring of dentate or fimbriate scales (P1. 75 :10). In neither Pellia nor Riccardia do either male or female plants have laciniate scales on the dorsal thallus surface. The present species, until recently, was known in the United States only from a single ancient report from Washington, D. C. (this report from the Lenert List is totally unreliable for reasons given by Holzinger), long before the species was clearly distin- guished from either M. flotowiana or Pallavicinia lyellii; without re-examination this report should not be accepted. The species, however, has recently been established from central New York (Schuster, 1949), and I have also found it to be fairly frequent in Minnc- sota. All of the North American material of the flotowiana-hibernica complex needs re-examination, since the limits of the two species are vague. The report of M. flotowiana from Michigan (Steere, 1947), from Nebraska (Evans, 1935), and other reports of the species from regions of low elevation in the eastern United States possibly all or partly refer to hibernica. I have sent materials from central New York and from Grand Portage, Minnesota, to the eminent European authority, K. Muller, who considers them tc be hibernica (in spite of the rather greater robustness attained by the plants than usually attributed to hibernica). The writer at first determined some of the Minnesota material as M. flotowiana, since the thalli may get to be 5-6 mm wide on female plants. Dr. K. Mliller has cor- rect,d this to M. hibernica. The Angle Inlet plants, in part at least, are strongly undulate-crispate, hence give the impression of M. flotowiana. Conklin (1929) reports M. flotowiana from the northwestern edge of Wisconsin; I have not seen his material, but surmise that it is the same as the writer's. Unfortunately, I have never been able to collect Moerkia locally at times when the capsules were mature, hence cannot give data as to the spore size. Schiffner has shown that M. hibernica may produce undulate modi- fications, which appear very similar to M. flotowiana, and has distributed material of these in his exsiccati, as var. undulata. Studies at Grand Portage marl bog reveal the following pertinent data: when M. hibernica grows deep in the shaded Thuya swamp (e.g., in the hydrosere subclimax) under such shaded conditions that it does not have to compete with caespitose species, but at most with the equally dorsiventral Pellia epiphylla,</page><page sequence="331">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL FIEPATICAE 587 it produces flat, virtually non-undulate thalli, which may be deceptively similar to those of Pellia epiphylla (though usually little more than half as wide, rarely to 4.5 mm wide); on the other hand, when growing in the open bog, amidst sedges and with such calci- philes as Lophozia schult2ii, the plants tend to be more undulate and wavy, correlated with a certain amount of crowding. Similar variation occurs in other Metzgeriales, such as Fossombronia foveolata, and is due to non-genetic causes. The question therefore arises, whether M. flotowiana is merely a coarser, more robust, strongly crispate modifica- tion of a more "sciaphilous," slenderer, flatter M. hibernica. Possibly the smaller spores of M. hibernica are merely a result of poorer nutrition of the sporophytes by smaller gametophytes. The answer as to whether we have two discrete species, or merely one (as Andrews, 1950, implies) therefore cannot be objectively answered until reciprocal trans- plant experiments have been made. In the meantime, the interested student is referred to the extended discussion in Schuster (1949, pp. 614-616; plate 15, Figs. 5-6), and should check his material with the following key, from Schuster (1949): 1.

The androecia also form short lateral spikes, each containing numerous antheridia in two rows (P1. 76:4, 6, 12).

Gray P1. 77:2-3 This species is extremely widely distributed, from the Tropics to the Tundra. It occurs throughout Minnesota, except for the prairie region. The species is a meso-hygrophyte or hygrophyte, occasionally even occurring sub- mersed. In our area, at least, a distinct calciphyte, occurring only on thin soil over such basic rocks as limestone or basalt, or in marl bogs. Over basic rocks (at a pH of 6.4- 6.9) it occurs with other calciphytes, such as Conocephalum conicum, Lophozia badensis, muelleri and Preissia, very occasionally (as at Wabasha City) Mannia rupestris and Re- boulia. In marl bogs, where it is more frequent, it occurs with Moerkia hibernica, Lopho- zia rutheana, Riccardia multifida, Conocephalum, and occasionally Lophozia grandiretis (in the more open parts of marl bogs, however, usually only with Preissia and L. ruth- eana); all of these species grew consociated at the Grand Portage Bog. The species also occasionally occurs on moist loamy or alluvial soils in basic regions, often on marly, springy slopes, associated with AMIoerkia, Geocalyx graveolans, and with species of Horse- tails (Equisetum scirpoides, variegatum and laevigatum, etc.). It rarely occurs among Scirpus caespitosus around sunny rock-pools, with Scapania irrigua and Drosera. The species is normally easily determined, even when sterile, living material being a characteristic opaque bright- to yellow-green color, with the brittle, turgid thalli somewhat greasy in appearance. The rather large size (mostly 4-6 mm wide) and nearly simple, only occasionally branched form of the thalli is characteristic (P1. 77:2); there is no distinct midrib (P1. 77:3). In the more rigid, turgid, somewhat fleshier form of the thalli, and in their total lack of a midrib, the species can be differentiated from our other superficially similar forms (Moerkia, Pallavicinia, Pellia). Furthermore, the ab- sence of distinct oil-bodies in the cells at once separates sterile plants from species of the last-named genera. When fertile, the male plants with short, narrower, androecial lateral branches, and the female plants with large, green, clavate calyptras (P1. 77:2) are quite characteristic. Confusion with other species of Riccardia is impossible, because of the large size and sub-simple condition of the thalli. Distribution.-ANOKA/ISANTI: Cedar Creek Bog, S.

It occurs almost exclusively in our area in marly bogs and swamps, most commonly in White Cedar (Thuya) Bogs. Here it is found on the wet, peaty soil around marl springs or holes, where the soil is saturated by marly waters. Commonly associated under such shaded, moist, sheltered conditions, are Moerkia hiber- iica (and/or flotowiana), Conocephalum, Plagiochila asplenioides, Riccardia pinguis, Geocalyx graveolans, more rarely Lophozia rutheana and grandiretis and Chiloscyphus pallescens (as at Grand Portage Marl Bog). Commonly found with the species is the marl-bog Horsetail, Equisetum scirpoides. Under conditions where the soil is rich in organic matter (humus), but saturated constantly by calcareous water, the present species appears to be a diagnostic species. When well developed, the species can be identified with the naked eye: the linear thallus being symmetrically 2-3 pinnate, unlike any other of our thallose Hepaticae (P1. 76:1). The following two species (R. palmata and latifrons) have the thallus more palmately divided, with the divisions much fewer, and much less regular. Furthermore, the younger parts of the thallus in R. multifida are bordered by a thin, unistratose margin (much more hyaline than the median portion of the thallus), which is about 2 cells wide over tnost of the ultimate branches (P1. 76:4-5). Furthermore, R. multifida usually invades decaying logs or peat only when these lie in marly waters, while R. lati- frons and palmata are decided oxylophytes-uniformly avoiding calcareous sites.

P1. 76:6-8 Distributed throughout the Coniferous Forest Region, and found into the Deciduous Region (but nearly absent from the latter in Minnesota). This species is much restricted in occurrence by several well-defined ecological requirements: a substrate of organic nature, and a combination of high humidity and moisture and relatively diffuse light. The species therefore occurs usually on decaying shaded logs in moist woods or swamps (here it is associated with Cephalotia sp., such as media, catenulata, Odontoschisma denudatum; Lophozia sp., such as incisa, more rarely ascendens and porphyroleuca, Calypogeia suecica, Anastrophyllum hellerianum, Jungermannia lanceolata, Jamesoniella, etc.). Much more rarely the species occurs over peat, capping the crests of moist, shaded, northwest-facing ledges; it is found, under such conditions, with Lopho2ia incisa, L. ventricasa, Mylia anomala, Cephalo2ia sp. (pleniceps, loitlesbergeri, media), Cephaloziella subdentata, Calypogeia sphagnicola, Odontoschisma denudatum, etc. The species never appears to be found under circumneutral conditions, "preferring" sites with a pH from about 3.8 to 4.8; it is a decidedly "lime-avoiding" species. The occurrence of the species is strikingly similar to that of Odontoschisma denudatum. The species is apt to be confused with only two other local forms: R. multifida and R. palmata. It differs from multifida both in ecological requirements (see under the latter), as well as in the much less regularly, semi-palmately to semi-pinnately branched thalli (P1. 76:6), with the ultimate branches much broader (between 0.5 and 1, occa- sionally 2 mm) and shorter and less linear. Furthermore, the ultimate branches are multistratose almost throughout (at most a border 1 cell broad is hyaline and unistratose) (P1. 76:7). R. latifrons differs from palmata in having the small androecial branches occurring on the same plant (P1. 76:6), and usually very close to female inflorescences: hence antheridia and calyptras can usually be found closely associated. When sterile, even fragments of the two species can usually be separated by the following combination of characters: 1. latifrons has the cells of the mature portions of the thallus extremely thin-walled (P1. 76:8) with the walls hyaline, and the cells varying from 30-50 ,u wide x 50-100 ,u</page><page sequence="335">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 591 long, averaging about 38 x 75 g (in palmata the cells of the older portions of the thallus become + thick-walled, brownish (P1. 76:9), and only average 30 x 50 ,u or less in size). 2. The mature thallus-segments are mostly 4-5 (at most 6) cells high in latifrons (P1. 76:7), and 4-6 times as wide as high, convex below and flat above; the ultimate segments or branches are up to 1 mm wide and relatively short and broad, often some- what dilated near the apex (P1. 76:6), and therefore wider near apex than near base (in palmata the main thallus branches are 6-9 cells high, mostly 3-4 times as wide as high, and biconvex; the ultimate segments or branches are often linear (P1. 76:11), only 0.2-0.4 mm wide, often strongly ascending or erect, and often narrowed towards the apex). 3. latifrons is monoecious, with male and female involucres intermingled (P1. 76:6); the male branches are short and inconspicuous (palmata is dioecious, with the male and female plants often in separate patches; the male branches often occur in large numbers and are easily evident, since they are long, linear, conspicuous, P1. 76:12).

Fig. 11:5-7; P1. 76:9-11 Distributed much like latifrons, but known only from the Coniferous Forest Region in Minnesota; much more infrequent than latifrons. Like R. latifrons, this species occurs almost constantly on decaying moist, usually relatively shaded logs (often lying in swamps or bogs, or in wet woods). R. palmata is a slightly more xeromorphic species, with narrower, thicker branches, with smaller, more obviously thick-walled epidermal cells: hence it often occurs on logs in somewhat more exposed areas than where latifrons is found. The two species are often found with the same associated species (see under latifrons), and except for a slight difference in toler- ance to moisture and light conditions, are ecologically nearly equivalent. At least in our region, R. palmata is confined to decaying logs, and rarely occurs on peaty banks or ledges. The species differs from latifrons in the more numerous, often more erect, narrower and generally linear ultimate branches of the thallus (P1. 76:11, 12), as well as in the smaller size and deeper green color (with the older portions distinctly brownish colored). For differentiation see R. latifrons. Distribution.-CARLTON: Carlton, C 1010.

This genus is readily recognizable by the narrow, litigulate thallus, at most only 1-2 mm wide, usually distinctly yellowish or whitish green, bearing bristle-like hairs on the margins (PL. 77:7-8). Forms with few or virtually no hairs might be confused with Riccardid, but differ from the latter at once *n the very distinct mid-rib, sharply defined from the lateral thallus-wings, which are a single layer of cells thick throughout (PI. 77:5-9). Our species shows a characteristic nearly dichotomous branching (PI. 77:7-8). KEY TO SPECIES 1. Marginal hairs of the thallus arising (in part at least) in groups of two from each cell, and arising strictly from the outer margin of the thallus (P1. 77:8, 9); ventral surface without any hairs, except on costa (PI. 77:8, 9); monoecious (PI. 77:8); cells 45 x 65 ,u; larger, 1-2 mm wide x 2-3 cm long; without marginal "gemmae" (P1. 77:8) -M. conjugata 1.

P1. 77:7-9 This species is frequent throughout the northernmost part of the deciduous Forest Zone ("Transition" of Merriam), and occurs into the Canadian Zone. In our region it is apparently limited to the Transition Zone, the single local record being at the north- west periphery of this common eastern species. The species occurs chiefly in shaded, protected places on moist sedimentary rocKs: such as sandstones and shales on the north-facing sides of ravines and gullies. It is here a pioneer on sheltered bare rock surfaces, in sites where the humidity is rather high, but where there is little seepage or spray. The species avoids very wet places, and is usually associated with other pioneer species, such as Radula complanata, R. obconica, Lejeunea cavifoliad etc. It is considerably less of an xerophyte than the local species of Frullanlia, and is therefore to be looked for on more shaded, less exposed and moister sites: occa- sionally on the underside of moist projecting ledges, where almost all of the incident light is reflected light. From its distribution, the species obviously has either a high toleration for calcareous conditions or a positive preference for sites rich in limestone or dolomite. The pH range is from about 5.8-7.2. In limestone regions the species occa- sionally invades the lower butts of trees or their roots. In most places there is a decided correlation between the occurrence of this species and the ferns Cryptogramma stelleri and Pellia glabella. The dichotomously branching linear thalli, usually occurring in large thin mats (P1. 77:7), and the more or less yellowish green color of the plants are quite characteristic in the field. Under the hand lens the numerous bristle-like hairs of the thallus-margins, and of the ventral side of the mid-rib (P1. 77:8-9), separate the plant at once from all cther species, except M. furcata.

It is to be anticipated on shaded, moist ravine walls along the North Shore. Usually separable at once from M. conjugata by the much smaller size, as well as the much sparser development of marginal hairs (P1. 77:5) (which occur, furthermore) singly and never in pairs). An xeric form or modification (var. u/rula Nees) occurs on bark. Subclass MARCHANTIAE Order MARCHANTIALES The Marchantiales are the most frequently observed of the Hepaticae, though they conitain the fewest in numbers. They are the liverworts, in popu- lar parlance, while the leafy forms are generally grouped with the mosses, by the uninitiated. The large size, and often extensive areas that are densely carpeted by these species attract a disproportionate amount of attention, compared with the large group of smaller leafy forms. The Marchantiales can be told from all other (leafy and thallose) liver- worts by the complex nature of their thallus. This consists of a series of specialized tissues, differing in nature of the cells, and in their function. There is a distinct, usually unistratose, dorsal epidermis, which differs from that of all other Hepaticae in that it bears pores. (These should not be con- fused with the true stomata occurring in the Anthocerotales.) Beneath the epidermis there is a layer of green tissue,- usually more or less spongy, that corresponds roughly with the chlorenchyma layer of higher plants; this green tissue may be further differelntiated into walls, forming chambers, and into green filaments, or there may be simply walls bearing chloroplasts. Beneath this spongy tissue there is a compact ventral, parenchyma-like tissue, which is surrounded below by the ventral epidermis. The presence of loose, aerating tissue, at once distinguishes the Marchantiales from all other Hepaticae. In the field the completely opaque appearance (usually yellow green to bright green above) and the leathery, firm texture are to be noted; further- more, all but the Ricciaceae have distinct pores, visible with the eye or a hand-lens. The tllallose Jugermanniales will not be confused with the Mar- chantiales, since they are usually smaller, and are always a translucent, more or less pellucid green; furthermore, they have smooth, non-areolate thalli that lack pores.

To study these, a small scalpel* is neces- sary; with this, it is possible to strip off a small piece of the dorsal epidermis, and put this on a slide, in water. This can be studied with the microscope. The pores will be found to be of three general types. 1. Simple and with the walls of the bounding cells thickened: therefore appearing more or less star-shaped. These are the stellate type of pore. This, in our species, is found only in Clevea. 2. Simple, and with the radial walls of the surrounding cells not unduly thickened. These pores, like the above, consist of a single layer of cells. Pores of this type occur in Reboulia, Mannia, Asterella, Lunularia, and Conocephalum, among our genera. 3. Compound pores. These are pores that are formed of several superimposed layers of cells (in cross-section therefore appearing like a barrel cut in half), with the upper and lower tiers formed of somewhat smaller rings. This type of pore can be easily recognized since each of these layers of cells can be seen when the microscope is focussed up and down. This type of pore occurs only in Preissia and Marchantia, among our genera. The type of gemmae receptacle found is also important. Gemmae are lacking in all but two of our genera (Marchantia and Lunularia). In the former genus they are cup-shaped, in the latter crescent-shaped. The nature of the ventral scales is also an important character. These can often be seen by examination of the velntral side of the plant, when pigmented. In many cases (Conocephalum, Marchantia, Lunularia) they are nearly or quite colorless. In such instances, they can be removed by dissecting them loose with a scalpel. Often scraping from the apex to the base of a plant will dislodge them. Finally, the thallus-section is of some importance in determining species and genera. It may be a critical character in determining sterile plants. Portions of fresh tllalli can be placed between pith, and sectioned with a razor blade. The tralnsverse sections can then be mounted in water and studied under the microscope. Usually only 1 section out of 10 or 20 made will be satisfactory for microscopic study, when hand-sectioned; but usually study of a single section will differentiate between the two basic types of thallus structure. The Marchantiales are studied best from living material. The dried plants do not readily regain their form (unlike the Jungermanniales). It is often possible, however, to get dry thalli to recover their shape by placing them for several hours in lactic acid. The genera of Marchantiales are often difficult to separate when only sterile plants are at hand. The following key is especially constructed to separate such plants.

They are therefore most often noticed by the beginning student. The Marchantiinae differ from the Ricciiniae in their generally larger size, as well as their tendency to grow in mats or patches of many plants. The Riccias (except for the more gregarious aquatic forms) all occur as more or less scattered, isolated thalli, which branch so freely that they tend to form rosettes. 'the local genera of Marchantlinae also differ from the Ricciinae in that the sporangia occur in groups, and these groups are elevated on erect, umbrella-like, or mushroom-like structures, the carpocephala (or archegonio- phores). In a few of our genera (Preissia, Marchantia) the antheridia occur in similar elevated, stalked structures, called antheridiophores. Unlike the Ricciinae, the capsules of the Marchantiinae contain elaters as well as spores. One of the importanit features that serve to separate the Marchantiinae from the Ricciinae lies in their biology: Marchantia and its relatives arl almost exclusively plants of areas that are never submerged-they therefore occur over moist rock-walls and cliffs, more rarely on soil in woods (especially burnt-over soil) or in swamps. They occur only rarely along streams and at the edges of ponds, hIowever. Our species of Riccia and Ricciocarpus, how- ever, are limited largely in occurrence to such areas along water, since their spores are largely water-distributed.

In Minnesota</page><page sequence="344">600 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) occurring only in the southern third of the state, and apparently absent in the western portions, except along the river valleys (as up the Minnesota River as far as Granite Falls). The species is a xerophyte or meso-xerophyte, and occurs in acidic as well as in more or less distinctly calcareous areas. It is very common, for instance, on limestones and calcareous sahdstones and shales along the Mississippi River valley, as far northward as Minneapolis and Taylors Falls. The usual occurrence is on moderately shaded and sheltered vertical rock-walls, and in their crevices, or on thin soil on narrow ledges of vertical cliffs. It is here associated most often with Conocephalum conicum, Mannia rupestris, occasionally Preissia quadrata, Mdrchantia, and more rarely Clevea hyalind, Scapania mucronata, Chiloscyphus pallescens and Lophozia badensis. Usually occurring under decidedly less mesic conditions than the Preissia, and therefore often recognizable by its occurrence. The ferns Cryptogramma stelleri, Pellaea atropurpurea, Woodsia ob- tusa are commonly associated. This is one of the very easily recognized species, when fertile; the star-shaped, moder- ately deeply 5-7-lobed carpocephala are quite diagnostic (P1. 84:3). When sterile it is much more difficult to recognize, but is separable by the moderately large size from Mannia and Asterella. Confusion is most likely with Preissia, which agrees with it in attaining a size of about 6-8 mm x 1-3 cm. In the field the two can usually be separated by the relatively smooth, usually somewhat yellow-green upper surface of the thalli of Reboulia: these are contrasted to the rougher, more bluish- or dull-green thalli of Preissia, with more protuberant pores. In both genera the thallus margins of growing thalli are purplish or brownish-purple, and the underside is always purplish-black; in Reboulia the older thallus margins never become bleached and white, however. Under the microscope, examination of a small piece of the dorsal epidermis will serve to identify Reboulia from all our other genera: it has the cells with distinct, often somewhat bulging trigones (P1. 84:2), and the simple pores of older parts of the thallus are surrounded by 4-5 con- centric circles of cells. A similar epidermis does not occur in any other local genus.* In material from more exposed sites, the pores show a further distinctive feature: the radial walls are somewhat more strongly thickened than the tangential walls of the surrounding circles of cells. In this Reboulia approaches the genus Clevea, which, however, has the pores surrounded merely by a single circle of differently shaped and oriented cells. Fertile plants often are confused with Mdnnia fragrans, because the Reboulia has at the apex of the stalk of the carpocephalum a distinct, sometimes dense beard-much as in the Mdnnid. This cluster of fine paleae, however, is formed by very narrowly linear- filamentous scales in Reboulid (P1. 84:3), while the scales are lanceolate-linear in Man. nid (P1. 78:1). Reboulid is also constantly paroecious (P1. 84:3), with the sessile, more or less reniform male receptacle situated immediately behind (basad of) the female carpocephalum; in Mdnnid the male and female organs never occur on the same branch.

Frye and Clark Pls. 78:1-3; 80:11 Widely but sporadically distributed throughout the greater part of the Deciduous Region of eastern North America, westward to Colorado and Texas; northward of restricted distribution and apparently absent from much or most of the Coniferous Region (at least in Minnesota), but reported from as far northward as Greenland. In Minne- sota this species occurs most commonly in the dry oak-savannah type of forest, where the Deciduous Forest and Prairie mingle. It may occur here on sandy terraces, on the ex. posed bare or sparsely grassy knobs, associated with such Prairie plants as Geum irflorum, Anemone patens, Astragalus caryocarpus, Oxalis violacea, Viola pedata and pedatifida, and the various species of Pucoon (Lithospermum). It forms an isolated xerothermo- phyte associule here, growing only with lichens, occasionally with Bryum argenteum. Rarely, where it grows on such Prairie sites at the crests of bluffs (as near Brownsville), it may be associated with Mannia rupestris, or with 'Clevea hyalina (as at Wacouta). The latter species under such conditions occur at their most xeric extreme, however. Not infrequently the species occurs on soil in crevices or at the edge of dry, exposed, warm rocks (as at Taylors Falls), and may here occur mingled with such relatively northern species as Lophozia barbata; such occurrences are relatively rare, however. Further west- ward the species is common on thin soil on dry, sunny granite outcrops, where it occurs together with Talinum rugospermum and Opuntia fragilis (as at Granite Falls). Under all conditions the dominant character of the environment is its exposed nature: very intermittent moisture conditions combined with high insolation and warm daily temper- atures. The occurrence of the species is usually almost enough to identify it; no other Mar- chantiine is such a pronounced xerothermophyte. In addition, the greyish-green color and rather rough texture of the dorsal surface (due largely to the protuberant and conspicu- ous pores), which is not noticeably areolate, with the thallus margins purplish, are quite characteristic. The species becomes very inconspicuous during dry periods: drying and shriveling much, with the thallus edges upcurved and the blackish-purple underside exposed; the plant, at such times will probably be overlooked. Sterile plants are also characterized by the linear-lingulate form: forking occurring very sparsely, and the thalli being subsimple. The fertile shoots are characterized by the strong development of ventral scales, the hyaline appendages of which project beyond the tip of the thallus to form a "brush" (P1. 78:1); this characteristic is little evident in summer, however, after fruiting and before development of new inflorescences. Under the microscope the very pachydermous dorsal epidermis is charactristic: its cells are thick-walled, usually yellowish, and have distinctly rounded lumens*; this character alone is often enough to identify this species. For separation from the superficially similar Asterella saccata see under the latter. Some of the local material of this species that I have studied in detail shows the antheridia occurring in loosely organized, irregularly shaped groups (often indeed more or less scattered along the dorsal midline of the thallus, as in P1. 78:1, and scarcely "in groups"); these are usually somewhat brownish pigmented, in contrast to the greenish- gray color of the surrounding thallus surface. Such "androecial groups" do not form distinct marginal disks (unlike M. pilosa and rupestris), and do not inhibit further growth of the thallus: therefore one may often see 2 or even 3 of these groups of sunken antheridia along the dorsal surface of a single thallus.

If these differences prove constant, it will be necessary to separate American material of fragrans specifically from European material. In the diffuse androecia these American plants agree more closely with the Mediterranean M. dichotoma (androgyna), and the western Mannma californica. I have seen male plants from a number of sites in Minnesota, some of which show circular terminal disks. The American material also shows a well-developed tendency for the development of carpocephala on more or less abbreviated ventral branches (P1. 78:1) as is the case with M. californica. In the diffuse androecia, the often short female branches, and the densely bearded apex of female branches, local material of M. fragrans differs from all other local species of Mannia. In plants from other collections (as from Ninemile Creek, Hennepin Co.) the female branches are quite or moderately elongate, though often ventral in origin from the underside of a linear shoot that eventually develops a terminal androecium. Since there seems to be a great deal of variation in the length of the female branches (and in their origin), as well as in the degree to which the androe- cial disk is developed (and to what degree it inhibits further growth of the shoot), it seems unwise to attempt to distinguish varieties of M. fragrans at this time. Sterile plants are sometimes hard to separate from M. sibirica (which may occur in admixture, as at Wacouta). The more linear, much more diffusely branched thalli of M. fragrans, and the rougher surface of the thallus (with the pores more elevated and distinct) will separate it from M. sibirica, however.

The abundance of this species in the southeastern portion of the state, in portions of Iowa and Wisconsin, and its total lack farther northward in Minnesota is hard to recon- cile with the occurrence of the species on the Greenland coast. However, if the sum- total distribution of the species is studied, it will be seen that its range is restricted very largely to the so-called unglaciated areas, and to their periphery. There are certain analo- gies in distribution between this species and Bryoxiphium norvegicum, the much-discussed Sword-moss, which deserve emphasis. These will be discussed in Part II of this work. MANNIA SIBIRICA (K. Muller) Frye and Clark Pls. 78:4-6; 80:3-10 Of extremely rare occurrence in the "unglaciated" region of Minnesota and the Missis- sippi Valley somewhat to the north. Known, at present, only from Whitewater Valley, Winona Co., and Stillwater, Washington Co. southward. This rare species has been 'reported but thrice before: from Siberia, Norway and (recently by Frye and Clark) from Alaska; all three of these records are from north of 58?L. The present reports therefore represent a very remarkable range extension of this species (if it is specificially distinct from M. pilosa). The species occurs under conditions similar to those frequented by M. pilosa: relatively strongly exposed to moder- ately shaded, somewhat moist to intermittently dry rock-walls, over basic sedimentary rocks (such as lime-rich sandstones). It occurs here as a pioneer species under a meas- ured pH of 7.6-7.8 closely associated with Clevea, Preissia quadrata and Mannia rupes- tris and such ubiquitous mosses as Funaria hygrometrica and Bryum argenteum. The separation of this species from M. pilosa is difficult. Muller first described sibirica as a variety of pilosa, but Massalongo soon thereafter separated it specifically. It would seem to the present writer that sibirica may be nothing more than the xeromorphic extreme of pilosa (i.e., possibly a mere modification of pilosa). For the present the</page><page sequence="349">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 605 customary specific distinction between the two is upheld.* M. sibirica, according to the literature, differs from pilosa chiefly in the extremely strongly thick-walled epidermis of the nearly plane thallus-surface (P1. 78:5) (in pilosa with thin or moderate walls often provided with more or less distinct trigones; the thallus surface more or less concave); in the more closely subdivided aerating tissue, some of the walls of which are produced into 1-3 cell long teeth or filaments (in pilosa not or rarely subdivided by projecting teeth or filaments); in the better development of the compact ventral tissue, which is at least as thick, in the thallus middle, as the aerating tissue above (in pilosa the aerating tissue is much looser, and twice as high as the ventral compact tissue, in the central portion of the thallus). In the collection from Whitewater State Park two cross-sections of the mature, fertile thallus showed an obtusely angulate, keeled, ventral compact tissue whose height was 225-285 g; the aerating tissue and dorsal epidermis together were 225 ,u high (the ventral tissue was therefore 1.0- 1.25 as high as the aerating tissue); a third section of a plant cultured in a wet environ- ment showed the keeled ventral tissue 220 ,u high while the aerating tissue was only 170 ut high. The thallus cross-sections looked exactly like those figured by Muller (1940). The air-chambers, furthermore, were more or less closely subdivided by partitions, and some of these partitions formed complete cell-plates, others teeth or filaments 1-3 cells long. The dorsal epidermis had extremely thick, brownish walls, with the lumens of the cells guttulate (P1. 78:5). The ventral scales were very much imbricated, and on the living plant (when somewhat dry and with inrolled thallus margins), gave the ventral side a highly glistening, purplish-blue metallic appearance. Muller (1940) states pilosa lacks oil-cells in the ventral scales and sibirica has them; in the present plants they were obvious and well-developed (P1. 80:4). The spores varied, within the same capsule, from yellowish to yellowish-brown, and measured 57-64.6 It in diameter.t According to Muller the spores of sibirica are 55-60 It in diameter; of pilosa 70-80 ,u; the present plants, therefore, have the spores more characteristic of sibirica. M. sibirica, in the organization of the thallus closely approximates M. fragrans: both species have the ventral tissue occupying a minimum of half the thallus thickness; both show a closely subdivided and compact, somewhat spongy photosynthetic tissue, in which tlie primary chambers are obscured by the development of numerous partial partitions and cell-plates, many of which are dentate or ciliate marginally (P1. 80:4-7, 10, 11). Furthermore, both species have the dorsal epidermis sharply set off from the underlying tissue: the cells being higher than wide and strongly thick-walled (P1. 80:11). In the rest of its organization, and in its size, M. sibirica stands very near M. pilosa. The differentiation of sterile plants of the Mannia pilosa-sibirica complex from those of the superficially identical Asterella ludwigii can be accomplished only with difficulty. The ventral scales appear to afford a constant means of separation. In the Mannia pilosa-sibirica complex the ventral scales have smaller cells. Muller gives them as 12 x 50 ,u for M. sibirica. In my experience they are 13-17 x 32-60 It on an average. The cells of the appendages are, however, distinctly larger, averaging 18-23 It wide, but not or scarcely longer (P1. 78:4) than in the body of the scale. In Asterella ludwigii the * I have had opportunity to culture the plants from Whitewater Park for several weeks. The young growth (produced in a nearly saturated atmosphere) was green, the ventral scales were nearly colorless, and the dorsal epidermis was thin-walled. However, the air-chambers were still subdivided and penetrated by secondary walls and partial parti- tions-the more or less spongy photosynthetic tissue persisting. A cross-section of such a young shoot is shown in Plate 80, Fig. 4. It will be noted that the keeled ventral tissue, in such leptodermous modifications, was fully as extensive and still as high or higher than the overlying photosynthetic tissue. This indicates tentatively that the differences between thalli of pilosa and sibirica are genetic in nature. Longer culturing under moist conditions is desirable to ascertain whether prolonged growth in a moist environment will result in persistence of a sibirica-type of thallus. f In material collected one year later (1950), with mature capsules, the spores measured merely 51-56 ,u, a very few to 58-60 ,u. The spore size is probably partly determined by nutritional conditions.</page><page sequence="350">606 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) ventral scales (P1. 81:4, 8, 9) have the median cells quite variable in size, but consistent- ly averaging larger than in Mannia. In some scales they are merely 18-26 x 76-112 A, in others they average as high as 36 x 60-100 ,u. Unlike in Mannia, there is in general no difference in cell-size between the body of the scale and the appendages. At least some of the other Minnesota reports of M. pilosa may, after critical study, be found to refer to M. sibirica.* The vast majority of individual patches of M. sibirica found were quite sterile. Such sterile patches often form more or less complete rosettes, and branch more freely than is common with fertile plants. Furthermore, the thallus-segments become somewhat wider in many cases. In the experience of the writer, the development of such sterile patches is always correlated with the occurrence on a more or less thick soil-layer (as over a narrow ledge), while fertile plants occur, uniformly, only as pioneers over bare rock surfaces. I have noted this correlation both at Whitewater State Park, in Allamakee Co., Iowa (3 miles south of Harpers Ferry), and on the second bluff, south of Lake City; in all three localities, an abundance of sterile material was observed over soil, while a smaller quantity of material was found directly over bare sandstone (or 6ver an ex- tremely thin, negligible soil layer). This same correlation has also been observed for M. rupestris, though it is less sharp. It would seem, in both cases, that we are dealing with pioneer species that are able to produce sporophytes only when occurring under extremely exposed conditions.

MANNIA PILOSA (Hornem.) Frye and Clark Pls. 79:1-3; 80:1-2 Restricted and very largely Arctic-alpine in distribution, occurring rarely much below the upper edges of the tree line. The species occurs in Minnesota somewhat as a relic, its chief distributional centers being around the Coniferous forested Rove-slate region of Cook County (where glaciation at any one time is claimed by some to have been incom- plete) and in the southeastern "unglaciated" region, in Deciduous forests. The occur- rence of the species northward is correlated with that of the Cordilleran and Arctic-alpine Asterella ludwigii (with which it occurs on the Pigeon River, and at Grand Portage), while in the southern area of its local range it is correlated with the equally strikingly disjunct Clevea hyalina and Asterella saccata. The species is a mesophyte or may even be a xerophyte, occurring most commonly with Mannia rupestris, Reboulia, and Preissia either as a pioneer chasmophyte or on thin soil over narrow, sheltered ledges. North- ward the species also occurs with the "calciphile" Scapania gymnostomophilla. Like the related M. rupestris the species is limited in distribution to distinctly calcareous areas, and has a pH range of from 6.8 to 7.9 in Minnesota. * I have also seen material referable to M. sibirica from northeastern Iowa (Bluff 3 miles south of Harpers Ferry, Allamakee Co., S 18059). These plants had the ventral tissue keeled below, and about 240-250 A high, while the closely subdivided photosyn- thetic tissue above was only about 220-230 ,u high. The dorsal epidermis of these plants was rather thin-walled, approaching the pilosa extreme, but showed distinct trigones. Whether the material reported by Conard (1945) from Iowa under the name M. pilosa is true pilosa, or represents sibirica is questionable.</page><page sequence="351">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 607 3 PLATE 79.

This leaves confusion possible only with Mannia rupestris and Asterelld. The firm dorsal epidermis (often with the cells thickened), which does not rupture with age, the narrower more elongate, lingulate to linear, thallus-segments (P1. 79:1), and the wide-spread purplish or brownish pigmentation separate sterile material from M. rupestris. When fertile, the occurrence of scales both at the base and apex of the purplish stalk, as well as scattered on the stalk itself (P1. 79:1), separates the plant from M. rupestris. Confusion is very possible with Asterelld ludwigii, which is similar in size, has similar ventral scales with small appendages that do not project beyond the thallus margins, has a similar cross-section of the thallus, etc. When fertile, the presence of pseudoperi- anths in the Asterella will at once separate it from the Mannid. When sterile, the differ- ences in size of cells of the ventral scales will help to separate the two species (see under AiI. sibirica). The differentiation between this species and the very close M. sibirica is given under the latter. It is possible that the reports of M. pilOSd from the unglaciated region by Conklin (1942) and those here given by the writer may in part belong to M. sibirica. The separation between the two species has only recently been attempted in North America. The material from Grand Portage has been critically studied, and is definitely refer- able to M. pilosa (rather than to sibirica), for the following reasons: 1. The thallus section on fertile, robust thalli is high, with the photosynthetic tissue well developed, and 320-370 ,u high. The compact ventral tissue is poorly developed and only 100-120 A high near the midline of the thallus (the ratio of ventral to photo- synthetic tissue therefore from 1:3 - 1:4; this is even higher than the 1:3 ratio indicated in Muller, 1940) (P1. 80:1-2). 2. The aerating tissue consists largely of complete, thin walls, and secondary walls which are not divided; the tissue, therefore, is much looser. Incomplete cell-plates which end in projecting teeth formed by isolated cells are scarce. However, several other characters do not agree perfectly with those of pilosa (as circumscribed by Muller, 1940). 1. The ventral scales have scattered oil-cells. 2. The spores are somewhat smaller, and considerably overlap with those of sibirica in size. Twenty-eight spores measured, from a mature capsule, showed a size range from 54-65 A, with an average of 58 ,u. A second capsule showed a range of from 54-64 A (23 spores), with the average 59-60 . This spore-size agrees more closely with that given by Muller for sibirica (1940). It should be pointed out, however, that Muller indicated the spores in pilosa were very variable.* 3. The dorsal epidermis consists of thick-walled cells, exactly as in sibirica. It is apparent, then, that if two species are to be recognized in the sibirica-pilosa complex, they are to be accorded the status at best of "small species." The most appar- ent differences that emerge between the two lie in the proportion of ventral to aerating tissue, and in the degree of development of secondary plates of the aerating tissue. Since Mliller (1940) indicates that there is a great deal of variation in the development of the ventral tissue and aerating tissue (and of the secondary cell-plates and filament-like * Miuller states (1907, p. 266) "Die Sporen der Gr. pilosa unserer Alpen (= G. carnica) untersuchte ich aus zwei capseln. Sie messen durchschnittlich 70-85 A. Darunter kommen viele von 65-90 ,u Durchmesser vor. . . . Ganz anders werden die Verhaltnisse, wenn man reichliches Material der Gr. pilosa aus den Nordlandern, ihrer Heimat, zur Priifung der obigen Angabe heranzieht. Solche Pflanzen zeigen Sporen . . . 55-75, 70 i' im Durchschnitt. . . . So messen z.B. die Sporen der Gr. pilosa var. sibirica nur 55- 60 A." It is thus apparent that the Grand Portage material has the spores much smaller than is typical for European pilosa, and in that approaches sibirica.</page><page sequence="353">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 609 teeth) in M. fragrans, the question inevitably arises as to whether M. sibirica should be retained as a species.* The question of the specific distinctness cannot be certainly answered. However, it must be stressed that the occurrence of M. sibirica in southeastern Minnesota is under more xeric conditions than in northeastern Minnesota. The maps of average July temper- ature and average annual precipitation are of interest here. M. sibirica in the southeast- ern part of the state occurs with a precipitation of 32 inches and July temperature of 72?F. (32/72 ratio). M. pilosd in northeastern Minnesota occurs with a precipitation of 30 inches and July temperature of 60 degrees or less (30/60 ratio). It is almost certain, therefore, that there is a much more favorable P/E ratio in the northeastern corner of the state. Possibly, therefore, the less xeromorphic structure of Mannid pilosd compared with the Mannia sibirica of the southeastern part of the state is merely environmentally induced. Further work on this problem is necessary before we can justifiably sink M. sibirica as a synonym of M. pilosa. Distribution.-COOK: Mt.

MANNIA RUPESTRIS (Nees) Frye and Clark P1. 79:4-6 Widely distributed throughout much of the northern part of the Deciduous Region, becoming rare in the Coniferous Region (and quite absent from it in Minnesota). Although the species is essentially a temperate or southern one, it is not a distinct xero- thermophyte as is M. fragrans. The species is a decided calciphyte, in Minnesota, at least, limited to calcareous sandstones and shales, in the shaded crevices or on the small ledges of which it undergoes ecesis. It occurs on such rocks in relatively shaded and sheltered areas: as at the foot of cliffs, where the arborescent vegetation affords much shade, and where the cliff-face cuts out all direct sun, and occurs here under mesic- xeric conditions, rarely as mesic as settled by Preissia. More commonly it is associated with the distinctly mesic-xeric Reboulia, and with Mannia pilosa and Lophozia badensis. A very general correlation exists between its occurrence and that of the calciphyte ferns, Pellaea glabella and Cryptogramma stelleri. Under these conditions, the species appeared to be a pioneer on a very thin soil on ledges, or occurred directly in rock-crevices. In addition to these more typical occurrences, where the species is often common, I have a single collection before me from the crest of a strongly insolated bluff 1.5 miles south of Brownsville. The plant occurred here under almost typical prairie conditions, associated wvith the xeromorphic Mannia fragrans, and with such typically xeric vascular types as Viola pedatifida, Lithospermum canescens, Oxalis violacea. Under such conditions the plant occurs on steep slopes, on sandy exposed soil somewhat shaded by juxtaposed * Since the above was written the writer has studied further material of the AM. pilosa-sibirica complex. All of the material seen (May, 1950) from northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota agrees in that the photosynthetic tissue is more compact than in "typical" pilosa, with the primary air-chambers more or less subdivided by partial secondary cell-plates, or by short filaments 2-3 cells long. In material from John Latch Park, Winona Co., for instance, we find a rather thin-walled dorsal epidermis (typical of pilosa) correlated with a strongly subdivided dorsal photosynthetic tissue. This material also had the ventral tissue about 120-150 ,a thick, while the aerating tissue was circa 200-225 ,u high (somewhat less than twice as high). Such plants, tentatively referred to AI. pilosa, seem intermediate between pilosa and sibirica. They form rather strong, if not conclusive proof, that sibirica is a xeromorphic modification of pilosa.</page><page sequence="354">610 THIE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) 3. 5. PLATE 80.

Such plants closely approximate M. pilosa in the deep purplish stipe of the carpocephala, the more purplish underside of the thallus, the browner and duller dorsal epidermis. However, the naked stipes of the carpocephala and the more or less ruptured epidermis of the older portions of the thallus are as in typical rupestris. Correlated with the more xeric occurrence, the thallus of such plants becomes more nearly linear-lingulate, as in- pilosa. Such plants have to be distinguished with care from M. pilosa (which, however, never occurs under xerothermic conditions). Under the above conditions the species occurred under pH conditions of 7.4 to 8.0. This species is characterized by the pure green color of its thalli (which become grayish with age, when the epidermis dies and ruptures), with no trace of purplish color (except for slight pigmentation of the ventral scales). The surface, in young parts of the plant, is quite shiny (much as in Lunularia), The pores become progressively larger and more elliptical with maturity (P1. 79:5), finally becoming very large and narrow, and eventually rupturing. The last season's growth, when seen in spring (when it bears archegoniophores) has the epidermis generally largely grayish and dead, with the dorsal surface more or less ruptured and spongy or lacunose. In extreme cases the dorsal surface becomes extremely disorganized and the walls of the air-chambers become plainly visible underneath (as is evident in P1. 79:6 drawn from a plant from Stillwater, Minn.). The extreme delicacy of the dorsal epidermis, with the eventual rupturing of the pores, is one of the best diagnostic characters of the species. Other distinguishing features are the rather small size (mostly only 2-4 mm wide at maturity and 1-1.5 cm long), the ten- dency to form compact, almost rosette-like clusters, and the general absence of any or much purplish pigmentation. When fertile, the hemispherical, circular carpocephala, occurring on slender, whitish (rarely at all reddish) stalks, are very characteristic (P1. 79:6); their virtual lack of any lobing is diagnostic.A The carpocephala rarely exhibit any scales (P1. 79:6), although a minute cluster may occur at the apex. In the lack of scales of the base of the stalk, and of the stalk itself, this species differs from pilosa and sibirica, which see for other differentiating characters.

The species has a much wider distribution in the Cordilleran Range (Rocky Mts.), and occurs again in Greenland.* In Minnesota the species appears limited in occurrence to the Rove-slate Region of Cook County, bordering Canada. The species is a decided calciphile, and occurs either as a crevice-plant or on narrow, rather mnoist ledges, invading either as a pioneer, or after previous colonization by such species as Gymnostomum, or Cephaloziella alpina and byssacea. Commonly associated with it are two other decided calcicoles: Mannia pilosa and Scapania gymnostomophila (as at Grand Portage, where all of the species listed above occur consociated). The distribution of such ferns as Woodsia scopulina corresponds very closely with that of the Asterella, at least in Minnesota, both being essentially western species. When fertile, this species can be told at once by the fringe of linear scales that sur- round each of the involucres (P1. 81:1). Such a pseudooerianth occurs only in the next species, A. saccata, among our Marchantiales. A. ludwigii differs from saccata by the key characters used above, of which the most obvious is the smaller size of th, appendages of the ventral scales: these never form a brush-like tuft at the thallus apex in ludwigii, indeed do not at all project beyond the thallus margins (P1. 81:1). When sterile, the species cannot be separated easily from Mannia pilosa, which has somewhat similar ventral scales, a similar thallus structure, similar pores, and a very similar facies. Since the two species occur together in northeastern Cook County, determination should be based on fertile plants. * Frye and Clark, (1937, p. 75) list it f- om Massachusetts, New York, Quebec, Missouri, Nebraska, in the eastern half of North America; with the possible exception of the Quebec record, these records are probably all based on the closely related A. tenella.</page><page sequence="357">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 613 PLATE 81.

This species occurs in eastern North America only in the "unglaciated" area of Minnesota. Westward it is at times frequent in the Arctic-alpine Zones of the Cordil- leran Range, ranging eastward as far as Wyoming and Montana. The occurrence of the species in Minnesota is remarkable: it represents a glacial "relic" showing a distribution analogous to that of C'levea hyalind (see p. 616) and to the flowering plant Claytonia chamissoi. A. saccata, like ludwigii and tenella, appears to be a decided calciphyte, and occurs always associated with rock outcrops, in the crevices or on the ledges of which it occurs, generally on thin soil. In our region the associated Hepaticae are Mannia pilosa and fragrans, Preissia and Reboulia, and Lophozia muelleri. When sterile the dense tuft of hyaline scales projecting beyond the apex of the thallus is distinctive: separating the species from all our other Hepaticae except Mannia fragrans.f Confusion with the latter is very possible, since it also has a tuft of scales at the apex of the stalk of the archegoniophore: simulating the scales of the pseudoperianth of Asterella. In the A. saccata, however, the dorsal epidermis consists of thin-walled cells (whose lumens are angular), while in Mannia these cells are more or less thick- walled with the lumen rounded. In cross-section, the Asterella shows large, empty dis- tinct air-chambers: in Mannia fragrans they are much obscured by the development of secondary walls (often ending in short filaments).

P1. 84:5 Confined entirely to greenhouses in our latitudes, where often abundant in undisturbed corners. This species is the only true "weed" Hepatic in our flora. It occurs occasionally in greenhouses with Marchantia polymorpha, but is much more abundant under artificial conditions than that species. The species is never fertile in America.? * Not only is the distribution of this species completely confused with that of A. tenella, in the work by Frye &amp; Clark, but the illustrations are even more so! It is sug- gested that the student compare their Fig. 3 of tenella (p. 72) with Fig. 1 of tudwigii (p. 74). The former is accredited to Schiffner, the latter to Miiller. Schiffner and Miiller, in turn, both accredit their figures to Bischoff. By a process of gradual redraw- ing during the course of the last century, the originally, for its time, excellent figure of Bischoff (1835) has degenerated to the point where it serves equally well for two dis- tinct species, because it shows in its redrawn version so little detail that it becomes virtual- ly useless and misleading. It is to be noted that in the figure 1, A. ludwigii, in Frye &amp; Clark, the redrawing has been so crude that the carpocephala arise dorsally on the thallus-a condition never occurring in Asterella. f In Clevea hyalina the ventral scales may also project somewhat beyond the thallus margins, but hardly form a terminal brush-like tuft. The stellate pores of the Clevea at once separate it, as well as the triangular or lanceolate form of the appendages of the ventral scales (which entirely lack hyaline oil-cells). : I have repeatedly searched for this plant on the bluffs in the vicinity of Winona, as well as elsewhere in southeastern Minnesota, without being able to find any trace of it. Holzinger made numerous collections of it, during a period of about a decade. It therefore appears possible that he collected all the material, and that no other sites are available for it, hence that the species is extinct now east of the Rocky Mountains. Since the available material that I have checked is all over 40 years old, and unsuitable for illustrations, none are given of this species. ?

Family CONOCEPHALACEAE CONOCEPHALUM Web. CONOCEPHALUM CONICUM (L.) Dumort. P1. 83:1-3 Extremely widely distributed and common throughout much of the state, except for the southwestern and western parts of the state. The species has a world-wide distribution throughout temperate and tropical regions, but becomes rare north of the southern part of the Subarctic-subalpine Zone; it is virtually absent in the Tundra Region.* The species has an extremely large ecological amplitude: occurring usually, however, in conjunction with rock-outcrops. It is common as a secondary species on moist, shaded to exposed rocks, associated with Marchantia, Preissia, and Reboulia, occasionally Ric- cardia pinguis, Pellia fabbroniana, Mannia rupestris or Clevea hyalina. The species is also common along streams and brooks, where it may occur on rocks, soil banks or on wet, decayed logs. Although not restricted to calcareous rocks, the species occurs most abundantly on calcareous or subcalcareous shales and sandstones. The species may occur in nearly full sunlight, and may occur in shaded holes with a light intensity only 1/400 of sunlight. This is one of the first species to be recognized by the beginner: the extremely large, conspicuous thalli, up to 16-20 mm wide and to 12-25 cm long, the usually yellow-green color (never deep or pure green as in Marchantia), and the very coarse polygonal areola- tion of the dorsal surface are highly characteristic (P1. 83 :1). Only Marchantia approaches it in size, but the Conacephalum has an intense, peculiar, mushroom-like, fragrant odor totally lacking in Marchantia. Conocephalum further lacks the gemmae- receptacles usually present in both Marchantia and Lunularia. This species fruits abun- dantly in April and early May: the conical archegoniophores (P1. 83:1), on long stalks up to 6 cm long, have given the species the common name of "Cone-headed Liverwort." In separate patches, and later (June-August) the oval, sessile, warty-appearing androecial receptacles mature. Distribution.-CLEARWATER: Itasca Park, Moyle 529.

CLEVEA HYALINA (Sommerf.) Lindb. Fig. 10:2; P1. 82 With a wide circumpolar, Arctic-alpine distribution and a much more restricted xero- thermic distribution in Deciduous Forest regions at low elevations. The amphizonal distqibution of this species has been recently reviewed by the writer (Schuster, MS). In North America with a wide distribution in the Arctic-alpine Zone of the Cordilleran chain (Rocky Mts.), and known again from Vermont and Quebec, north to Greenland, with several stations in southeastern Minnesota. The species is a decided "calciphile," occurring in Minnesota under pH conditions of from 6.8 to 7.9 (10 measurements). It occurs on thin soil over calcareous sandstones or shales, or in their crevices, under a great variety of conditions as regards moistuLre and insolation. Many of the European xerothermic occurrences are from exposed, dry sandy places, associated with such pronounced xeromorphic species as Mannia fragrans, occasionally Asterella saccata. In Minnesota the species is restricted to shaded, densely forested steep slopes and the foot of cliffs, where it grows under distinctly mesic to mesic- xeric conditions, together with Reboulia, Mannia rupestris, Mannia pilosa and Preissia, occasionally Chiloscyphus pallescens, often in proximity to the ferns Pellaea glabella and Cleilanthes feei, occasionally associated with the northern Corydalis aurea, as well as often consociated with the local Dodecatheon amethystinum. This species is known in the field at once by several salient characters: the colorless or pale violet ventral scales have the tapering hyaline appelndages protruding beyond the thallus margins (especially when the latter are slightly inroled (P1. 82:1)); the dorsal surface of the thallus is a peculiar, somewhat crystalline greyish-green (with the margins only slightly or sometimes not at all purplish); and the carpocephala occur dorsally on the thallus, rather than in an apical notch, as in all our other genera (P1. 82:1). Even when carpocephala are not present, the pit-like depressions, fringed by scales from which they arise, can be seen on the dorsum of the thallus. This latter character alone is enough to separate the genus from all our other genera. Under the microscope two characters occur that do not recur in any other of our species: the characteristically light violet ventral scales are not sharply appendiculate, but gradually run out in a narrowly triangular process (P1. 82:6-7), and these scales totally lack all traces of oil- cells; the pores of the thallus are distinctly thickened along their radial walls, giving them a star-shaped ("stellate") appearance (P1. 82:8).* The species is one of our most dis- tinctive hepatics and no difficulty should be experienced in identifying it. In its size it approaches Reboulia and Preissia, without attaining the maximum size these species attain. When carpocephala are present the species can be recognized instantly in the field: these are a peculiar translucent bright to yellowish-green, in contrast to the normal opaqueness of the greyish-green thallus, while in our other genera the carpocephala are strongly opaque, as is the rest of the thallus. The carpocephala, furthermore, are more or less strongly lobed and cruciate (P1. 82:10): well-developed ones producing a maximum of four sporophytes, each of which occupies the interior of one of the deep, rounded lobes; most often one or more spoiophytes fail to develop (presumably because of absence of fertilization), and the carpocephala then become either 3-lobed or bilobed, or occasionally bear a single lobe (PI. 82:1, 9). The species is dioecious and male plants are some- times rather rare; they generally occur in separate patches. The male thalli are quite characteristic because they bear, along the dorsal midline, a group of irregularly distrib- uted papillae or conical protuberances. These represent antheridial ostioles, that have become elevated-much as in some species of Riccia. In the scattered antheridia, with the overlying ostioles elevated as finger like papillae, Clevea differs at once from our other * Some of the Minnesota material, from shaded, moist bluffs almost totally lacks these radial thickenings, and has unmodified pores.</page><page sequence="361">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL fHEPATICAE 617 10.

Family MARCHANTIACEAE PREISSIA Corda PREISSIA QUADRATA (Scop.) Nees P1. 83:4-6 Widely distributed throughout the northern part of the Deciduous Zone, northward well into the Arctic-alpine Region. In Minnesota occurring along the eastern edge of the state, and throughout much of the northern half: apparently completely absent from the Prairie Region, except for a limited penetration up the larger rivers (as for instance the Minnesota R., as far as New Ulm). The species is a mesophyte-hygrophyte, and is restricted in distribution by a decided dependency upon CaO. I have never seen the species away from calcareous sites. It is common on moist shales and sandstones, or basic igneous rocks associated with Pellia fabbroniana, Solenostoma pumilum, Lopho2ia badensis and gillmani, Tritomaria scitula, Scapania -gymnostomophila and cuspiduligera: here it occurs as a pioneer or as a secondary species, amongst the mats of which the above leafy liverworts grow and compete. Except in the northeastern corner of the state the species also occurs widely with Conocephalum, occasionally Riccardia pinguis, Chilo- scyphus pallescens, Clevea, Reboulia, Marchantia and Mannia rupestris on moist or drip- ping ledges and cliffs. Although the species occurs most commonly associated with rock outcrops, it also is frequent in marly ditches, here occurring with Riccardia pinguis and typically with Parnassia glauca. Occasionally the species occurs in open marl bogs, here occurring also with Riccardia pinguis as well as with Lophozia rutheana (as at Grand Portage). The pH range varies from about 6.8 to 8.2. The species, under all condi- tions, occurs as a hygrophyte or mesophyte, but may occur in limited quantity under almost xeric conditions as a pioneer chasmophyte in crevices of the exposed rocks of Lake Superior (as south of the Temperance River), where it may occur with Sc. gymnostomo- phila. The moderate size (usually between 6-10 mm wide and 2-4 cm long), and the dull green color, with the lateral thallus margins somewhat purplish, and the ventral scales always blackish-purple, give the species a rather characteristic appearance, even when sterile. Confusion is possible only with Reboulia and Clevea (which are similar in size), while the smaller size at once eliminates the Mannia rupestris and pilosa. From all of these genera, and all other genera except Marchantia, Preissia differs at once in the elevated, whitish, rather prominent compound pores (P1. 83:4-5). In Reboulia the pores are simple (i.e., flanked by a single layer of cells), and the epidermal cells are distinctly collenchymatous (in Preissia always very thin-walled and lacking trigones [P1. 83 :5] ). In Clevea the pores are stellate and simple, and very different from those of Preissia. Reboulia, with which Preissia not infrequently occurs (especially when the Reboulia occurs at its more mesic extreme), can usually be separated, from Preissia in the field by the smooth and often slightly more yellow-green thallus, with the pores extremely incon- spicuous, while the thalli of Preissia are a little rough appearing because of the many elevated, whitish pores, and usually of a duller green color. The margins of the older thalli of Preissia are also usually bleached and decolorate-never in Reboulia. Under the microscope the absence of oil-cells in the ventral scales is diagnostic: separating the genus from all others except Clevea and Mannia pilosa.</page><page sequence="363">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 619 4- PLATE 83.

MARCHANTIA L. MARCHANTIA POLYMORPHA L. P1. 84:6 Extremely widely distributed, throughout virtually the larger part of the tropics, north into the edge of the Tundra Zone. In Minnesota frequent throughout most of the state, particularly so in bogs and swamps underlain by marl, but very restricted in occurrence in tlhe southwestern part of the state. In the northeastern corner of the state becoming scarce in the subarctic-subalpine, but occurring occasionally under subcalcareous conditions in wet depressions in Thuya-swamps and bogs, associated with Equisetum scirpoides and such Hepaticae as Riccardia pinguis and multifida (as on Big Susie Island). The species occurs under rather varied conditions: as a pioneer on wet sunny, exposed rocks in stream-beds and ravines, usually under somewhat calcareous or circumneutral conditions, in bog holes in marl bogs, on moist, shaded to exposed cliff-walls, etc. It occurs associated with Conocephalum very frequently, less commonly with such thallose species as Pellia fabbroniana, Riccardia pinguis, Preissia commutata, etc. One of the requirements of the species appears to be a high concentration of mineral ions (Ca, Mg, N, etc.): hence the species is of extremely restricted occurrence on organic substrata (never occurring on decaying logs, unlike Conocephalum), and occurs in bogs only when these are underlain by marl. The species also is frequent in greenhouses, as a weed (often with Lunularia), and is a characteristic pioneer after fires (probably because of its "affin- ity" for a high concentration of soluble inorganic ions). Marchantia is one of the most easily identified species: the dark or dull green thallus (lacking a yellow complement characteristic of Conocephalum), with the reticulation of the surface distinct (but much finer than in Conocephalum), and with no distinct odor (unlike 'Conocephalum) will separate the species from other very large Marchantiales. Usually the cup-shaped gemmae-receptacles are present (P1. 84:6), and these are quite diagnostic. When the archegonial receptacles (which are shaped like the skeleton of an umbrella) are present the species cannot be confused with any others. The antheridial blanches (P1. 84:6) are shaped like the archegonial, but much more shallowly lobed. Distribution.-ANoKA:Murday Creek, Van Wert. ANOKA/ISANTI: Cedar Creek Bog, S 14857, S 11691.

The members of this family differ from the latter at once in that the sporangia, or spore-producing organs are not borne on specialized structures (called vari- ously carpocephala or sporangiophores). Instead, the entire sporophyte has become highly reduced, and is surrounded by the tissue of the thallus (P1. 88:4). Other sterile Marchantiales differ from the Riccias in that they have well- developed pores, often of a complex nature. In Riccia these pores are ves- tigial and very inconspicuous, surrounded by hardly modified cells; in Riccio- carpus they are scarcely more distinctly developed. Furthermore, the terres- trial forms of the Ricciaceae almost without exception form distinct circular patches, or rosettes, formed by the equal growth and equal dichotomous branching of a single plant.t In the other Marchantiales, growth proceeds more swiftly, and the dichotomizations occur less frequently: the plants there- fore rarely form patches that are distinctly rosette-like. There is a further difference in habit that should be noted. The Riccias are confined largely to alluvial soils, or areas bordering alluvial soils; they virtually never occur on rocks, unless these are subject to inundation or lie in alluvial deposits; some species, in fact, are normally aquatic. The other Marchantiales are very closely associated with cliffs and ledges, normally (most frequently with basic rocks of some sort), with the exception of the ubiquitous Marchantia and Conocephalum. The latter two differ at once from the Ricciaceae in their relatively enormous size. The Ricciaceae lhave been very poorly collected in Minnesota. Since they occur along sloughs, in wet fields, on loamy, moist river-banks, and at the edges of paths in such places, they frequent areas very poor for all other Hepaticae. Therefore they have not been looked for critically, and have been collected only haphazardly and by pure chance. In the following key those species are included from the surrounding states whose distribution will prob- ably be found to include parts of the Mississippi River Valley system. Sev- eral of the species have been found in Wisconsin, in the St. Croix River Valley, and almost certainly occur on the Minnesota side. KEY TO GENERA 1.

Corda P1. 85:1-4 Widely distributed in ponds and along slow streams and rivers, throughout nearly the entire state; becoming occasional or rare in the northeastern corner of the state and in the Coniferous Zone in general. The species is found virtually throughout the United States, north in Canada to Quebec and British Columbia. This common species is generally aquatic or subaquatic, floating on the surface of small ponds and in the backwaters of streams, associated with the Duckweed (Lemna minor, Spiradela polyrhiza) Associule. The plants here occur generally as imperfect or partial rosettes (forming about half to two-thirds of a circle), floating on the surface of the water and are mostly 5-9 mm in diameter. In temporary ponds the plants often are stranded on wet, mucky soil during the drier summers, growing then shaded under Sagittaria and Alisma and Sparganium, often with Riccia fluitans. Occasionally the plants grow stranded on the margins of streams, then together with such Riccia species as crystallina and frostii. Aquatic forms are known at once by the long, linear or spear-shaped, violet-purple ventral scales (P1. 85:3), which form a conspicuous ventral mat. Terrestrial forms lack these, and have much narrower thallus segments, mostly about 2-3 mm wide. Such terrestrial forms are much more like species of Riccia in appearance, and form more or less compact rosettes, like Riccia, generally 18-30 mm across. Both the terrestrial and aquatic forms differ from all species of Riccia in that *the thalli bear complete, narrow sharp median grooves, even in the older portions of the plant (P1. 85:1); furthermore, examination of a piece of dorsal epidermis shows the presence of distinct, if inconspicu- ous, pores, and of scattered oil-cells (P1. 85:4). In our species of Riccia neither distinct pores, nor oil-cells occur. This species is generally said to produce spores very rarely. In much of the Minne- sota material (in over two-thirds of the available collections), numerous ripe sporangia could be found. These are produced during the summer, and occur in 3-4 or occasion- ally more rows, in large numbers, along the costa of the mature portions of the segments. While immature they are obvious because they form small whitish nodules, more opaque than the rest of the thallus. When quite mature they become even more obvious as small black spots along the costa of the thalli. Distribution.-CARVER: Chaska, Ballard 62B. CHISAGO: Center City, Taylor 1268.

All of our species of Riccia agree in being found as pioneer species on loose ground that is subject to continual disturbance: either at the hand of the physical environment, or at the hand of man or animals. The species occur either stranded at the edges of rivers and streams where flooding occurs periodically and disturbance is of such an intensity that higher vegetation does not succeed, or in fields, at the edges of cattle-tracks or in plowed areas, where more perennial species are unable to survive. Very often they occur along paths near the edges of rivers, where the soil is so disturbed and com-</page><page sequence="368">624 THIE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) pacted that only hardy pioneer species can survive. The ability to succeed in such disturbed environments is largely due to the fact that the species usually are annuals: as long as the habitat is favorable or tolerable for a good share of the critical growinig season (after spring floods, for instance), they 6.X2 PLATE 85.

They occur not infrequently with such other annual pioneers of mineral substrates as Anthoceros and Notothylas, as well as the related Ricciocarpus, and such ubiquitous hardy mosses as Bryum argenteurn. Since the ecology of our species is nearly identical, it will not be treated under the individual species (except for the somewhat divergent R. fluitans).* The species of the genus are extremely variable in most cases, due to the fact that there is often extreme adaptation (correlated with extreme variation of the microenvironment, especially as regards intermittency of moisture and intensity of light). Several generalizations may be stated, which may be use- ful in interpreting material that appears atypical: 1. Species with marginal cilia may "lose" them-nearly or entirely-under very moist conditions; inversely, they become unusually abundant and obvious on material from xeric sites (such plants usually with purplish pigmentation, thicker and narrower segments and smaller size). In a few species normally without cilia, extreme xeric forms may show them. The species showing variation in this regard are chiefly R. hirta, beyrichiana, arvensis, eldeeniae, e.g., the Sectio HIRTAE. In R. atromarginata, of the Sectio PAPILLOSAE, the same variation occurs: material from xeric sites is abundantly hirsute, both dorsally and marginally, on the ultimate segm.ents; in material cultured under moist conditions in the greenhouse, the cilia develop only to a slight degree. 2. The thallus becomes thinner (therefore, relatively broader) under moist condi- tions, with the flanks more sloping, more acute. Inversely, under unusually dry con- ditions, the thallus sections become very narrow and high. Therefore, th-e width: height ratios given on the followilng pages must be considered as average, not extreme figures. For instance, R. beyrichiana from extremely moist conditions (grown in a greenhouse pot, under RH of 75-100%) showed segments 4-5 times as wide as high, and 2.5-3.5 mm wide, approaching R. glauca in this regard; on a dry bank, the same species showed segments merely 1 3-2 times as wide as high, and only 1.3-1.8 mm wide. Associated were extreme differences in development of cilia: the form from the moist site showing few, the form from xeric sites showing an abundance of them. 3. Plants under moist (and/or shaded) conditions develop little or no purplish pig- mentation of the lateral thallus margins. Inversely, most species develop purplish pigmen- tation of the lateral thallus margins under conditions of extreme insolation. This varia- bility is especially to be noted in the Sectio HIRTAE. On the other hand, R. sorocarpa and its allies may show whitish, thin, translucent margins even where growing under conditions of extreme exposure (when associated, R. beyrichiana shows deeply purplish lateral margins). The ecological variability of a species, when known, will often be an aid in its recognition. Several other characters appear more stable, but have been little used in the literature, for instance: angle between branches; the relative width vs. length of mature segments. These two characters serve to impart a great deal of individuality to the various species-most easily shown in the associated illustrations. * Subsequent to the completion of this manuscript, R. dictyospora, austini and tricho- carpa, as well as plants referable to the doubtfully distinct R. macallisteri were found in the prairie region of southwestern Minnesota. These species add another element to our Riccia-flora, consisting of xerothermophytes with a more or less discrete inactive season during at least part of the summer. These species are allied much more strongly than any other regional species to the vegetational types characteristic of arid warm areas. I am indebted to Dr. Don Jacobs, who collected the material and made the deter- minations. I have had opportunity to personally check only part of this material.</page><page sequence="370">626 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) In the determination of material, one usually must prepare cross-sections of the ultimate segments, in order to note the form of the segments. Such sections are best prepared at or slightly anterior to the middle of the ultimate segments. From these may be noted whether the thallus is provided with sides that spread gradually (oblique flanks), or whether the flanks are nearly vertical (in which latter case, the segments are usually rectangular in section). Furthermore, the width (relative to height) of the segment must be noted.* Material which "looks" sterile often shows immature or even nearly mature, spores, when the older portions of the older segments are torn open. Therefore, one should not conclude that spores are absent if the bulges (which mark the maturing sporangia) are not readily apparent. The spores, though niormally tetrahedral in all species when immature, may retain the tetrahedral form (majority of our species), and show a distinct translucent brownish wing at the juncture of the convex external face and the three flat inner faces; they are then spoken of as "angular" and as "distinctly wing-margined." In a few cases, no wing-margin is developed and the spores, as they approach maturity, become rounded with little except sculpture differences to mark the juncture of the external and inner faces. Spore size is an important species character and should be determined from mature spores, by measuring the longer diameter. The size of the areolations (commonly present on the exter- nal face) is also a significant species character, and is to be determined by measuring several areolae on several spores and determining the average size.

PI. 86:1-3 A widely distributed species, occurring throughout the greater part of the temperate zones of Europe and North America, southward into the Tropics. In Minnesota found wherever ponds or slow streams occur, but becoming quite rare in the northern Coniferotus Region. The species has different ecological preferenda than our other species of the genus: it is primarily a hydrophyte, occurring submersed, where it floats under the surface of the water, as a member of the Riccia-Lemna trisulca Associule. Occasionally the species occurs along shorelines (but less frequently so thaii Ricciocarpus natans),* or in dried-up ponds,f but always below the line of periodic high water. The terrestrial material loses the characteristic narrowly linear nature of the thalli to some degree, but even when growing for long periods on moist alluvial earth, the species still remains conspicuously narrower than our other species. There is no distinct preference evident, as regards pH, but the species is never found in stagnant, acid bog waters. This is a very easily recognized species, that in its floating form may be repeatedly overlooked, since it does not clearly resemble other bryophytes. The very narrow linear translucent thallus segments and the repeatedly dichotomous forked form of the thallus are absolutely characteristic (P1. 86:2). Terrestrial material, though becoming consider- ably broader, never has the chief segments more than 1 mm wide, and always at least 5-8 times as long as wide. The stranded (land) forms of this species develop thalli with the ultimate segments somewhat wider, but never over 1 mm wide. Both land and terrestrial forms have thin, pure, light green thalli that show the very conspicuous, large air-chambers (P1. 86:1-3). This species has never been found fertile; the fertile plant often called the land form of Riccia fluitans has been shown by Muller (1940) to represent a distinct species, Riccia canaliculata. Riccia fluitans has recently been shown to be a composite species by Muller (1939- 1940, pp. 298-308). He divides it into four species, of which only the true fluitans is certainly known from North America. Since one or the other of these species may yet be found in our area, the subjoined key is given for the separation of the species of the fluitans complex: 1. Thallus thin, 3-8 times as wide as thick, the branches not grooved distally; thalli strongly branched, dichotomous, no ventral branches; aquatic or terrestrial plants 2 2.

RICCIA FROSTII Aust. P1. 85:5-7 This species differs considerably in facies from R. crystallina. The ultimate segments are much narrower (mostly 0.6-1.4 mm wide) and are usually linear and elongate, and rather crowded, lying close and parallel to each other (P1. 85:5). In thalli that are nearly or quite mature, the older portions of the plants are already in poor shape, witl the epidermis gone and the tissue lacunose and ruptured (P1. 85:5). The cross-section d this species is quite high and narrow, mostly only 1.5-2.5 as wide as high, but, as in R. crystallina, the dorsal surface is quite flat, except for the poorly marked groove near the very apex of the ultimate segments (P1. 85:5). Well-developed plants usually have a distinctive greyish-crystalline color, but this is shared by the related R. crystdllina. The present species usually fruits very abundantly: in late summer and fall the entire dorsal sthrface of individual plants may become pitted with the extrusion of numerous black, coarsely granular appearing masses of spores. The spores of this species will at once s4parate it from our other species of Riccia. They are relatively small, mostly 46-58 IA in longer diameter, strongly tetragonal (triangular in outline), with the outer face with rather numerous subparallel lines formed by low ridges, which anastomose little or not at all, except for a limited degree near the middle of the face (P1. 85:7). Our other species all have the spores over 60 ,u (those of sullivantii alone are occasionally as little as 54 A), and all have them more or less distinctly areolate, or areolate-cristate. There are too few records of the species from the area to make any generalization regarding distribution possible.

Occurring in our area with R. crystallina and terrestrial forms of Ricciocarpus. RICCIA CRYSTALLINA L. P1. 85:8-10 This species has a distinctive appearance: the ultimate thallus-segments are relatively broad, mostly over 1.6 mm wide (P1. 85:10), and the cross-sections are usually well over twice as wide as high. In this way it contrasts with both of the other species likely to be confused with it on our area (R. frostii and sullivantii). The latter two have narrower segments, mostly 0.6-1.4 mm wide, that are often sublinear: a condition never occurring in this species. The chief segments are also merely 1.5-2.5 as wide as high, normally, in R. frostii. Like these two species, however, R. crystallina has a rather greyish-green appearance normally, with little or no purplish along the thallus-margins * Since the above was written, the expectation of the writer that one of the other four species of the R. fluitans-complex would be found in the general region has been realized. R. rhenana has been found to have a scattered distribution in eastern North America, and is now known as far north as Iowa. It will almost certainly occur in southern Minnesota. R. canaliculata (s. str.) also appears to occur in North America (California, etc.); it may eventually be found in our region. Only R. duplex has yet to be found in North America. The writer's reports above all appear to represent R. fluitans, s. str., but some of the reports of other collectors (not all of which have been personally verified) may belong to R. rhenana. R. fluitans, s. str., is much more frequent than the above reports would indicate; many sight records have been made, but are not entered.</page><page sequence="376">632 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 49 (2) normally; the dorsal epidermis is also soon indeterminate, and the surface is eventually lacunose (P1. 85:10). When spores are available the species is easily separated fromn frostii by the larger spore size (almost all over 70 A), with the ridges of the external face relatively incomplete, but forming large areolae (the distances between ridges always over 10 A) (P1. 85:9). In the spore size the very closely related R. sullivantii stands nlearly intermediate between frostii and the present form: it has the spores about 50-75 ,u, but has them relatively completely areolate on the outer face, with the areoles about 8-12 At in diameter. Unlike R. frostii, the capsules are not as abundantly produced and are included within the thallus for a much longer time, whereas they are extremely abundant usually in R. frostii and very soon rupture out through the dorsal surface, the entire plant often being pock-marked with numerous blackish masses of extruded spores and broken sporangia. This species not infrequently occurs with R. frostii and terrestrial forms of Riccio. carpus natans (as at Minnehaha Park). Like the other species of Riccia it frequents disturbed areas chiefly, mostly along moist paths along streams, where disturbance is sufficient to prevent the ecesis of the more erect and caespitose vascular plants, that would swiftly shade it out.

In the surrounding area known from Wisconsin (Cedar Grove), South Dakota (Custer) Nebraska (Peru), and Iowa (Lynn, Emmet, Kossuth, Palo Alto, Woodbury, Black Hawk, Iama, Polk, Jasper, Poweshick, Iowa and Louisa Cos.). RICCIA SULLIVANTII Aust. Widely distributed in Deciduous Forest Regions and the southern edge of the Conif erous Forest Region, from Quebec and Ontario southward to the subtropics (Florida), westward to Mississippi (Schuster), Arkansas and Missouri in the south, and Iowa and Illinois and Wisconsin (Conklin, 1929) in the midwest; certainly to be found in our region, but as yet undiscovered. A species very generally of areas with periodic flooding, as on river banks and on the edges of reservoirs (there often with R. hirta and beyrichiana), restricted to sites with a relatively high moisture content of the substrate, and with little or no intermittency of moisture. The species is almost uniformly pure green in color (very rarely slightly purplish tinged on the margins), relatively delicate, much like land forms of R. fluildns in the relatively narrow, but perceptibly broader, segments (which average 0.7-1.4 mm wide). Unlike our other species of Ricciella, this species produces sporangia which protrude ventrally (hence the dark spore-masses are never discharged dorsally). The spores are also distinctive in that they are uniformly areolate with a regular meshwork, the areolae ca. 8-13 A wide-much as in many of our species of Euriccia, but quite unlike our other species of Ricciella. RICCIA SOROCARPA Bisch. Pls. 88:2; 89:5-7 This frequent and widespread species is occasional from the northern edge of the deciduous forests southward; it has been reported north even to southern Greenland and occurs southward to Florida and Mexico. It has recently been found a single time in Minnesota, but undoubtedly previously overlooked, since it occurs nearby in Wisconsin (see Conklin, 1929), Illinois, and westward to Montana and Washington. The species can be told at once from most other Riccia species that occur in our region by the acute, sharp, dorsal groove of the ultimate segments of the thalli (P1. 89:5-7), the decolorate, narrow, hyaline, acute margins of the segments, the greyish- green color and delicately, regularly reticulate-appearing surface of the opaque thalli (P1. 88:2). In the acute sulcus and margins of the segments, the species recalls R. dkctyospora, macallisteri, and austini. It differs from all three in the very diagnostic manner in which the epidermal cells collapse to leave a cup-shaped, thick-walled remnant over the thick-walled cells of the underlying, persistent hypodertnal layer, as well as in</page><page sequence="377">1953 SCIHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 633 the distinctly wing-margined, tetrahedral-rounded spores. The plants never bear marginal spines or cilia, unlike the superficially slightly similar R. hirta. The most diagnostic feature, which will separate the species from all our other Riccia species lies in the fact that the epidermal cells of the thallus collapse, with the layer immediately below (the .7~~~~~~~~ PLATE 87.

R. sorocarpa, like R. hirta, and arvensis, has spores with the external face very regularly areolate-reticulate; these reticula- tions are 6-10 jg across, and 8-10 of them occur across the face of most spores; the spores are mostly 65-80 ,u in diameter, including the narrow wing margin. The smaller spore size will at once separate the species from R. hirta. Distribution.-NICOLLET: Quartzite outcrop, Minnesota R. valley 3 miles west of Courtland, D. Jacobs (Sept. 7, 1951). (With Riccia dictyospora, macallisteri, austini, trichocarpa, beyrichiana, hirta.) R. ARVENSIS Aust. (_ R. bifurca Hoffm.) This widespread species, occurring with a distribution much like that of R. sorocarpa, has not yet been found in Minnesota. It occurs from Greenland southward to Texas, and has been reported from the surrounding areas, such as Wisconsin (see Conklin, 1929) and Ontario and Indiana; it will most certainly be found in eastern Minnesota. R. arvensis can be told from our other species of Riccia with a compact photosyn- thetic tissue (and a minutely reticulate dorsal surface) most easily by the shallow and broad dorsal groove of the terminal segments of the thalli. This groove is narrow and nearly closed at the apex of the ultimate segments, but becomes about one-third the width of the segment shortly posterior to the terminal portions of the segments: there is therefore a broad, usually flat-bottomed channel that may persist for the entire ultimate and sometimes (less clearly) into the penultimate segments. Only R. beyrichiana (among other regional species) has such a broad and flat median groove. R. arvensis differs at once from beyrichiana in the smaller size, with the segments mostly 0.6-1.5 mm wide (vs. 1.5-2.5 mm in beyrichiana), in the normal absence of any trace of marginal spines, and in the smaller spores, averaging 70-90 It across. Small forms of beyrichiana are often difficult to separate from large forms of arvensis; beyrichiana often nearly or quite lacks marginal spines, as is normal for arvensis. Such forms are difficult to place unless spores are present, when the spore size affords a constant means of separation. RICCIA IIIRTA (Aust.) Underw. P1. 86:4-7; 87:1 This widely distributed species has been found from Connecticut and Nebraska south- ward and westward to California; it will probably be found repeatedly in southern and southwestern Minnesota. The species superficially looks like R. arvensis (bifurca). It forms rosettes up to 10- 12 mm across or more, that are generally 3-4 times dichotomous (P1. 86:6); the individu al branches are narrow, mostly 0.6-1.2 mm wide, linear, and bear a narrow (but not very deep or sharp dorsal groove (P1. 86:5). The narrow dorsal groove recalls that of R. sorocarpa, but is not as sharp or deep; it is, however, much narrower than in R. arvensis. R. hirta differs from both of these species in that the younger portions of the terminal segments bear a few to many small spines or cilia; these are frequently quite poorly developed and may be deciduous with age (P1. 86:5, 6). In both sorocarpa and arvensis the spores average 70-95 A, rarely larger; in hirta they are consistently larger, averaging 90-125 -A (P1. 86:4, 7). The species has a characteristic appearance, por- trayed in Plate 86, Fig. 6 and 87, Fig. 1. Riccia hirta is also likely to be mistaken for small forms of R. beyrichiana, our other species bearing short marginal cilia. The narrow thallus segments, with the dorsal sulcus no more than two-fifths the width of the segment, and the spores (which are areolate on their inner faces, similarly to but often less deeply, as on the outer face), will at once separate R. hirta from beyrichiana. Comparison of the illustrations (compare P1. 86:6 and 88:7) will show the differences in facies between the two species.

The species frequently occurs with others of its congeners, at the sole certain Minnesota station with: R. sorocarpa, trichocarpa, dictyospora, macallisteri, hirta and austini. Normally this is one of our easiest species to identify. It is characterized by the usual presence of cilia (which at once separates it from all other regional species, except R. trichocarpa and hirta) (P1. 88:7). The cilia are often numerous, and are quite stout, less than 300 ju long. The low, wide thallus cross-section (P1. 88:4, 5) will at once separate the species from the related R. hirta, as well as from the very different R. irichocarpa. In beyrichiana, typical segments are 2.5-4 times as wide as high, and bear a broad median sulcus, fully one-third the width of the segment; in our other two ciliate species, the segments are mostly 1.5-2, rarely 2.5 as wide as high, and bear a narrow dorsal sulcus, at most 2/5 the thallus-width. The short cilia might lead to confusion with the similar (but usually much smaller) R. hirta, but there are numerous differences between the two species, among them: the larger spores, usually 90-130 /L, with the innel faces nearly flat (P1. 88:3) and not areolate (in hirta, inner faces as well as outer areolate, and spores usually 90-110 ,u, rarely to 125 u in longer diameter); the wider segments, usually 1.5-2.5 mm wide (in hirta mostly 0.6-1.5 mm wide), with broader dorsal sulcus. The species may possibly also be confused with R. arvensis, a species found nearby in Wisconsin (and certainly to be found in our area). The latter usually lacks marginal cilia, or rarely has a very few inconspicuous ones; it is also a smaller species, with the branches less than 1.5 mm wide, and has smaller spores (merely 75-90 u in diameter), with smaller areolae, mostly less than 10 A in diameter (in R. beyrichiana with the areolae mostly 12-18 ,u). Distribution.-NICOLLET: On quartzite outcrop, Minnesota R. valley, 3 miles west of Courtland, D. Jacobs. RICCIA DICTYOSPORA Howe P1. 89:1-4 Known from only a restricted number of stations, from Connecticut south to Georgia (type), westward to Texas and Arkansas; the Minnesota station somewhat disjunct, and lying at the northwestern limital point of the range of the species. R. dictyospora does not differ essentially in its ecology from our other xerothermo- phytic terrestrial species, but is perhaps found more frequently on soil in stony fields, or on thin soil associated with tock outcrops. At the sole Minnesota station were associated Ricciocarpus natans, as well as Riccia macallisteri, austini, sorocarpa, trichocarpa, hirta and beyrichiana. R. dictyospora belongs to a small group of species including R. austini and macal- listeri and sorocarpa, which are characterized by the sharp, acute sulcus of the ultimate segments (P1. 89:1-3) (appearing as if impressed with a sharp knife), by the very sharp and acute, but scarcely winged, lateral margins of the segments of the thallus, by the bisexual thalli, and the constant absence of cilia. Confusion with other than these three species is unlikely, among our representatives. The relatively small, deep purple to blackish purple ventral scales, which do not protrude conspicuously beyond the thallus margins, as well as the normally deeply purplish margins of the segments, together with the narrower segments (1-2 mm wide), will at once separate it from the uniformly green R. austini, which is further characterized by the decolorate projecting large ventral scales. R. sorocarpa can also be separated from R. dictyospora by the lack of purplish pigmenta- tion (both of thallus-margins and the very inconspicuous colorless ventral scales. Fur- thermore, the epidermal cells (and underlying layer of hypodermal cells) of these two species differ greatly. In R. dictyospora, the epidermal cells soon collapse after maturity, and leave only obscure vestiges, while the thin-walled hypodermal cells take over their function; in contrast in R. sorocarpa, the epidermal cells on collapse leave a persistent, thick-walled, cup-shaped basal portion sessile on the thick-walled hypodermal cells. Confusion of R. dictyospora is most likely with R. macallisteri, and one frequently observes material that can scarcely be placed without any doubt. In R. dictyospora the</page><page sequence="381">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 637 thallus margins and ventral scales are apparently almost without exception blackish purple, and the spores are brownish and remain translucent at maturity. On the other hand, in R. macallisteri, the tnargins of the thallus segments are usually colorless and the ventral PLATiE 89. Riccia dictyospora.-1 Cross-section of old part of ultimate segment. 2.

Both species are characterized by the almost spherical spores, devoid of any distinct wing-margin, scarcely exhibiting any trace of the tetrahedral form of the juvenile spores (PI. 89:4). Similar spherical spores occur again only in R. austini. Distribution.-NIcOLLET: On quartzite outcrop, Minnesota R. valley, 3 miles west of Courtland, D. Jacobs. (Dr. Jacobs writes "The Riccia dictyospora material is skimpy sorocarpa, beyrichiana, austini). RICCIA MACALLISTERI Howe Previously reported largely from the Prairie belt, from Austral regions. Described from Texas, and reported also from Nebraska and Oklahoma; the present report mark- ing the northernmost known boundary of the range. This species is extremely closely related to R. dictyospora (as clearly emphasized by Frye and Clark, 1937, p. 15), agreeing with it in the tendency for formation of purplish pigmentation in the ventral scales, in the rounded (not tetrahedral) spores devoid of wing-margin, in the acute flanks of the thallus, and in the sharp, impressed, acute sulcuts of the distal portions of the ultimate thallus segments. In the epidermal and hypodermal cells the species resembles R. dictyospora (see latter), and differs from R. sorocarpa (which has tetrahedral, angular spores, bearing a distinct wing margin); except for that, it is very similar in appearance to R. sorocarpa, which, however, never appears to develop purplish ventral scales. Shade forms of R. macallisteri, when without spores, must there- fore be separated with care from R. sorocarpa, utilizing the characteristic diferences in the form of epidermal and hypodermal cells (see under R. sorocarpa). The separation of R. dictyospora from R. macallisteri is treated under the former. The single present collection represents "the sun -form with violet scales, decolorate nmargins, and typical wingless spores," according to D. Jacobs, the collector. Distribution.-NICOLLET: Over quartzite outcrop, Minnesota R. valley, 3 'miles west of Courtland, D. Jacobs, Sept. 7, 1951 (with R. dictyospora, hirta, trichocarpa, sorocarpa, beyrichiana, austini). RICCIA AUSTINI Steph. PI. 88:1 Widely distributed in Austral and Sonoran regions, both in the Prairie and Decidu- ous Regions, from Rhode Island to Alabama and Georgia, westward to Nebraska, Texas and California; a doubtful report from Ontario. Only recently found in southern Minne- sota, which marks the northwestern limital point in the known distribution of the species. This large species of Riccia is easily determinable even when sterile. The thalli are mostly 2-3 times dichotomous, with broad ultimate segments 2.5-4 mm wide (and mostly 2-3, rarely 4 times as wide as high). The segments are characterized by the acute, usually subalate, green to colorless margins, and by the prominent, decolorate ventral scales which project slightly beyond them (when segments are moist), forming a distinct fringe, but become very prominent when the segments dry and their margins curl inward (P1. 88:1). No other of our species of Riccia possess such conspicuous ventral scales. The species is related to R. dictyospora and macallisteri-species with ventral scales that are purple to purple-black, and which do not protrude beyond the thallus margins. It shares with the latter two species the rounded spores, which do not clearly show their tetrahedral immature shape, and which do not bear discernible wing-margins. Confusion with other species is unlikely, except perhaps with R. sorocarpa, which resembles the present one in the green color, often decolorate and acute margins of the segments, sharply incised sulcus of the distal portions of the ultimate segments. However, R. soro- carpa is a much smaller species, with inconspicuous ventral scales, and with distinctly wing-margined, tetrahedral spores. Distribution.-NICOLLET: Quartzite outcrop along Minnesota R. valley, 3 miles west of Courtland, Jacobs, Sept. 7, 1951 (det. confirmed by author); with Riccia dictyo- spora, macallisteri, hirta, beyrichiana, sorocarpa, trichocarpa.</page><page sequence="383">1953 SCHUSTER: BOREAL HEPATICAE 639 RICCIA TRICHOCARPA Howe P1. 87:3-6 A widely distributed species in western America, from Oregon to California, south to Baja California, east to Arizona and Texas, northward to Oklahoma, with a single station in Minnesota, forming the northeasternmost limital point in its range. Essentially a species of prairie regions. This is our easiest species of Riccia to determine, since it bears extremely long, slender, spine-like cilia, which are often 500-900 ,u long. No other Riccia, in North America, is provided with such obvious, elongate cilia. The cilia occur not only on the thallus- margins, but usually are found (in groups of 1-12) over the thallus overlying the in- cluded sporangia. The local material, collected by D. Jacobs, was found associated in a small area with other species of the genus, including: R. hirta, R. beyrichiana, R. dic- tyospora, R. macallisteri, R. austini, R. sorocarpa. Dr. Jacobs writes, regarding the single collection made that "the material seems entirely typical, including the few spores present."

GLOSSARY* Acuminate-gradually and longly narrowed to a point (lobe in P1. 61:13). Air-chambers-cavities within the thallus (in Marchantiales), usually opening to the dorsal surface by a pore (Pls. 79:4; 80:1). Amphigastria-iunderleaves; the reduced (often vestigial) lower row of leaves, often hidden amongst rhizoids (Pls. 29:3; 52:6; 66:2; 63:4). Androecium-the male "inflorescences," e.g., the antheridia and surrounding tissues (bracts, etc.) (Pls. 24:14; 32:1; 58:7; 69:4; 79:1). Antheridiophore-the elevated male "receptacle" of certain Marchantiaceae, consisting of a disk and stalk issuing from the thallus (P1. 84:6). Antheridium-the male reproductive organ, usually globose or ellipsoidal, and situated on a short stalk (P1. 25:5). Antical-referring to the upper surface or margin (as of a leaf), as opposed to postical (e.g., view of P1. 25:7 is antical). Apiculate-with a short, sharp point (leaf-lobe in P1. 40, figs. 11, 12). Appressed-flatly pressed against (as thalli in P1. 87:1). Approximate-close together (as leaves in Pls. 20:10; 51:14). Archegoniophore-the elevated female "receptacle" of some Marchantiales, bearing groups of archegonia; = carpocephalum (P1. 83:1, 6). Archegonium-the female reproductive organ, typically flask-shaped (Pls. 33:6; 34:6). Areolae-small angularly shaped areas (as on surface of thallus, P1. 83:1, or on surface of spore, P1. 73:2-3).
