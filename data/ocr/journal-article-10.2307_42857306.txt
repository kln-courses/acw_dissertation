He then asked me if I was a Buddhist, to which I responded that I was not. I later reflected on his unusual ques- tion and thought that it was to do with present giving in Buddhism, but after review- ing two of his books on or using Tibetan philosophical discourse as empirical data I now think that Kenneth Liberman was 'alluding' to something else. Having read his 775</page><page sequence="2">776 Sociology Volume 43 « Number 4 ■ August 2009 work I now realize that the members' knowledge I didn't have at the time was that of the Buddhist conception of the essential emptiness of things and, as a consequence, the impossibility of any real Ownership' of them. The reason for my recounting this is to attempt to illustrate that I did not need to have knowledge of Buddhism (or of his, as then, unpublished writings), nor he have knowledge of the cost or otherwise of the pen, for us to produce the emergent order that was our conversation. That is not to say that that emergent order would not have produced a different conversation had we been more 'compatible' members. This 'social fact' of order being mutually pro- duced and made available to both parties, rather than something that social scientists must impose upon a phenomenon to give it order, is what I understand to be meant when it is stated that ethnomethodological studies are investigations of social order. Those aspects of orderliness that ethnomethodological studies describe are not fea- tures in that phenomenon as theorized by social scientists as the order, and then applied to the phenomenon/a. Ethnomethodology's discovery of order is that of the features in and as that phenomenon of order - the feature is the phenomenon of order as co-constructed and made available to the actors themselves. I stress this point as I think it is key to understanding Liberman's enterprise in HusserVs Critique of Reason (2007). He states: Meanings are exhibited more than they are explained, and the signs in which some intelligibility is maintained are a public possession that people hold in common more than they are the private contents of a consciousness whose meanings are negotiated until they become identical, (p. 110, italics in original) Further, he argues that the intelligibility of meaning is in the local work of members and that this work '... is more oriented toward preserving the orderliness of the inter- action than it is toward communicating meaning or preserving strict conformity with formal definitions' (p. 109). Thus, in the conversation with Liberman, my lack of Buddhist knowledge did not prevent conversation as our skills at mutually producing social order in public allowed our successful, for all intents and purposes, conversation. Liberman believes that we have become prisoners of our reason, which he sees as endemic in the social sciences, partially because we have not understood our pro- cesses of reasoning and to do this we have to look ethnomethodologically. In Husserl's Criticism of Reason (2007) Liberman is concerned with this problem and avoiding the slip which he describes as unreflexive apophantic rationalizing: where 'apo- phansis is the self contained unity of determination' (Husserl, 1969: 126, quoted in Liberman, 2007: 13), that is, it refers to a theory of analysing ideal forms of judge- ment (Woodruff Small, 2007). To show this he has undertaken a respecification of the phenomenological project (and a critique of phenomenological reflection) via re-assessment of Husserl, and his and phenomenology's focus on the 'mind'. Liberman suggests that Husserl had actually real- ized the importance of, but failed to develop as a research programme, locally situated activity. In the second part of his text, Liberman, with reference to his own data of philo- sophical debate among Tibetan Buddhist monks as a perspicuous example, demon- strates through an examination of empirical data and respecification of 'reason', that the 'apophantic requirements of logical reasoning constrain human understanding'.</page><page sequence="3">Studies in and as ethnomethodology Jenkings 777 The significance of apophansis, located as originally a project of Husserl, is a critique of formal analytic reasoning where 'Once truth has been reduced to tech- nique, technicalities can be placed in the service of "rationalising" any thesis' (Liberman, 2007: 26), by which I believe he means it is, in essence, tautological. Liberman does this by reviewing Husserl's criticism of reason and explaining why Husserl was not able to follow this project through, which would have been to prac- tically investigate actual phenomena: rather than hypothesizing about phenomena, which instead became the phenomenological method. Liberman's thesis is that it is in fact Garfinkel and the ethnomethodological project that are the true heirs to Husserl's phenomenological studies. The role of the Tibetan dialogical practices in this is Liberman's view that to achieve that understanding we need to see what practices are present in medieval rationality. However, for Liberman, looking at written texts of the period will not give us this understanding; instead we have to look at the embodied practices of reasoning - practices which still survive in the dialogical reasoning of the Tibetan Buddhist monks. Now this may seem a bit esoteric but the argument is compelling and the respecification of Husserl absorbing - especially since, unlike in German sociology, in British sociology Husserl and the phenomenological project are woe- fully neglected (at least in my humble opinion). Following a discussion of Husserl, Liberman looks at 'Levinas's Critique of Apophantic Reason' in chapter three and notes that, for Lévinas, reason cannot be reduced to logic, which is a key theme throughout the text. In chapter four, 'Heidegger's Respecification of Thinking', the theme is that knowledge cannot be communicated by proposition without the co-accomplishment of that knowledge. This is all leading to chapter five and the central thesis on Harold Garfinkel, who is proposed to have taken up the problem- atic of Husserl and made it his own by 'not adding new theoretical inflections, but by chasing down where they can be witnessed, where they come alive with a real worldly coherent practice of thinking reason' (Liberman, 2007: 91). I thought this chapter on Garfinkel to be a good explanation of the ethnomethodological project that, simply put, 'repudiates talk about phenomena, in favour of undertaking direct investigations of phenomena' (p. 99, italics in original). Of course it is not just a matter of undertaking investigations, but how one does so. This is well explicated via a discussion of ethnomethodology's principle of 'the unique adequacy of meth- ods', which basically cautions against defining the use of methods ahead of access- ing the phenomenon, and of gaining access to the local praxis, preferably by becoming a member oneself. The radical reflexity is key here too, and Liberman cautions against the routinization of method and the emptiness of meaning that this results in (this can happen in ethnomethodology too, especially conversation analytic ethnomethodology, Liberman notes). The second part of the book looks at the practical in situ dialogical philosophical reasoning of the Tibetan Buddhist monks to illustrate what such an ethnomethodolog- ical investigation of reasoning looks like. In this case it is a respecification of the dia- logical reasoning as it has been described by Western Tibetologists who analysed only the written texts (in terms of Western apophantics), rather than the lived in situ philo- sophic reasoning of debating monks. I felt the conclusion to the book was weak as it</page><page sequence="4">778 Sociology Volume 43 « Number 4 ■ August 2009 did not return to the core argument of the problem of apophantic reasoning, Husserl's location of actual practice as the site of phenomenological inquiries, which Husserl failed to achieve himself, but which has been achieved by Garfinkel's ethnomethodol- ogy and the importance of this achievement. Yet what I may not be alone in finding intriguing in reviewing Liberman's Husserl's Criticism of Reason was the idea, not stated by Liberman but of my own (mis-)reading, that there was a similarity between the Buddhist conception of emptiness and its understanding, and ethnomethodology's anti-foundationalism which requires: the insight of an analyst whose radical self understanding unrelentingly strips away his/her own theorizing whenever its development progresses to the point of reifica- tion that blocks the analysts access to the real worldly work the people being inves- tigated are doing, (p. 37) I would also say that a familiarity with Liberman's Dialectical Practice in Tibetan Philosophical Culture (2004) (see Jenkings, 2006), probably enhances this book, especially the data section, as it comes with a CD of video clips which Husserl's Criticism of Reason does not. For those wishing to get a taste of Liberman's analysis without taking on the full field study (Liberman, 2004) or his 2007 work, both of which I recommend, he has a chapter in Orders of Ordinary Action (Hester and Francis, 2007). Here Liberman uses the same data to investigate Thinking as a Public Activity' which is a more succinct argument, but not of the Husserl thesis. Also reproduced here is Garfinkel's plenary address from that conference where he states that when he was described as the 'father of ethnomethodology', he replied 'Yes, but everybody knows the eth- nomethodologists are a bunch of bastards. But nobody knows whose bastards they are' (p. 13). This is modesty of course; they are his bastards! Here Garfinkel gives his own account of ethnomethodology's programme, which is both exact and enigmatic. The theme is the nature of ethnomethodological studies and their capture of details of order that the formal analytic studies of sociology ignore. Ignore because their formal analytic technologies (which include the apophantics Liberman described) presume that there is no order in the plenum and that the order comes from the formal technologies of sociology. In the papers that follow there are some interesting studies of order and the prac- tical action that is in and of that order. There are two sections, 'Studies of Practical Action in Organizational Settings' and 'Studies of Situated Reasoning', with four and five chapters respectively. The first paper is an ethnomethodological study of power, followed by Mondada's 'Operating Together Through Videoconference: Members' Procedures for Accomplishing a Common Space of Action'. The latter is an excellent study, utilizing audio-visual technologies. The paper captures the phenomenon of multiple participation in surgical procedures and its teaching across geographically dispersed locations. It focuses on members' practices that make available for seeing the clinical methods being taught. Of course, visual data has various analytic affor- dances and limitations, but ethnomethodological studies of situated action now reg- ularly, though not necessarily, use these forms of data capture. One reason for this is that the reliance on purely audio accounts is of limited use for the multi-modal</page><page sequence="5">Studies in and as ethnomethodology Jenkings 779 descriptions of interaction in face-to-face interaction and/or the use of technologies and artefacts. Indeed the three monographs in this review have all collected audio- visual data, even those leaning towards conversation analysis (CA). Ikeya and Okada's chapter, entitled 'Doctors' Practical Management of Knowledge in the Daily Case Conference', shows that ethnomethodology's 'unique adequacy of method' ensures that video will not become the only data collection form used. It successfully uses audio recordings and ethnographic observation to look at knowledge as a members' problem. In this case, following the ideas of Alfred Schutz: the distribution of knowledge. The paper nicely describes the local organi- zation of the case conference as a means of reporting a case development by junior doctors: its format, evaluation and the pedagogic co-production and use of 'the case' in training by consultants in an asymmetric knowledge distribution scenario. Carlin's 'Auspices of Corpus Status: Biography as a Phenomenon of Respecification' is in an intriguing next chapter in that its topic is a respecification of citation anal- ysis and critique of its exclusion of practical reasoning. This paper does not itself describe situated practical reasoning, one factor which Carlin states makes a text ethnomethodological for Garfinkel, but relates Garfinkel's account of his biograph- ical practices (which is not the same as a description of Garfinkel's situated practi- cal action, which he seems to use as standing on behalf of). This made me wonder about the potential corpus status of Carlin's own paper (but not necessarily the orig- inating study which may include situated action), as it seemed to indicate a corpus of secondary, even tertiary ethnomethodology literature (which may include this review). The need for a radical reflexivity becomes apparent at this point because, I suggest, ethnomethodology is indifferent to the corpus status of established litera- tures (Garfinkel, as noted by Carlin, p. 96). I really liked this chapter, whatever its corpus status, especially as it made me consider my reasons for the choice of books in this review and the role of the review itself. The following five chapters in the studies of situated reasoning were all interest- ing studies of which 'Cultures of Reading: On Professional Vision and the Lived Work of Mammography' by Slack et al. was notable. Taken as a whole the collection is a worthy one; whether it constitutes a respecification of sociological knowledge is another thing. The two remaining books covered in this review are both monographs and both based on audio- visual data. However, they differ greatly, not because of the subject matter - one on academic presentations in a university setting and the other home- based video recordings of playing with a dog - so much as to their analysis of their data. Rendle-Short's (2006) The Academic Presentation : Situated Talk in Action is a more conversation analytic audio-visual ethnomethodological analysis, while David Goode's (2007) Playing with My Dog Katie : An Ethnomethodological Study of Dog-Human Interaction comes from a more ethnographic ethnomethodological analysis, and in many ways that makes them very different. Rendle-Short presents an examination of the coordination of verbal and non-verbal activities in the aca- demic presentation. While the focus is almost solely on the work of the presenter, it is shown that rather than a monad actor presenting to an inert audience the whole process is a recipient designed interactive event. The book's account of the largely</page><page sequence="6">780 Sociology Volume 43 « Number 4 ■ August 2009 monological format complements Liberman's argument about the role of dialogical interaction in the Tibetan Buddhist teaching and learning process. Yet at the same time it illustrates it as a locally situated context-dependent activity with displays of engagement and disengagement throughout its course - the more so when using var- ious technologies and artefacts rather than just reading from a script. While Rendle- Short does well within the limitation of video stills to represent the visual data, the dynamics of movement and coordination with talk are inevitably lost. Liberman (2004) provides an audio-visual CD to accompany the text, which I believe is the way to go in the presentation of video-based analysis. I particularly liked Rendle- Short's transcription system, based, as with most ethnomethodology and CA tran- scription systems, on the Jeffersonian system for conversation, but adapted to the requirements of specific phenomena, data analysis and presentation. These adapta- tions can be uneven but Rendle-Shorťs video data transcription is excellent and eas- ily understandable without having to return to the list of Transcription Conventions every other page. Her transcription is based on the verbal action, as is typical, and builds the other interactions into the transcription and analysis incrementally over a series of chapters, so we see the details of the multiplicity of coordinated actions and their orderliness without the initial confusion of a very dense transcription. What also makes this a good demonstration of video analytic transcription is the phenomenon under analysis. Most readers have sat through academic presentation as detailed in the transcriptions, so readers do not have to contend with a radically unfamiliar phenomenon - as in Liberman's description of dialogical reasoning - and so, even if the mundane is made strange by the detail, it remains familiar enough to allow more detailed description without confusion. This may be an aspect beneficial for those unfamiliar with video analysis transcription. Rendle-Short argues against a simple view of the academic presentation through the description of verbal and then non-verbal deixis. As this text is about the description practices, its conclusions are minimal. This is not a criticism as it does not aim at an ethnomethodological respecification. David Goode's Playing with My Dog Katie , targeted at both the ethnomethod- ological and the animal-human interaction audiences, does aim at a respecification and in doing so produces a much different video analytic text. This is evident from the start with its two forewords: one from an ethnomethodologist (Mike Lynch); the second by an animal-human psychologist (Robert W. Mitchell) - both of which are a bit underwhelming. It also has two corresponding introductions and so sets itself a hard task of satisfying two, and some would say discrete, audiences. Goode stresses, as discussed above, that shared meanings are not required to organize human inter- action, and thus removes that issue of inner states - especially that of animals. While this is a video-based study, it is completely different in its treatment of the data: the data have no audio recording; and, when discussed, do not come with a transcrip- tion of non-verbal behaviour. They do come with a CD of video clips and stills, but these are more illustrative of the textual discussion than part of the analysis as such. In some ways I think this, its analysis, is the weakness of the text. Much of the text is given over to an ethnomethodological respecification of the human-animal inter- action psychology literature, which it does via a literature review, whereas the</page><page sequence="7">Studies in and as ethnomethodology Jenkings 78 1 amount of space given over to the video data (evidence for the respecification) is too little, at least from my perspective. Its respecification argument is well made, but the analysis slips into anthropomorphism; although I go along with the notion that the human-animal split is a relatively recent (and unhelpful) development. This book is a very personal project, and not necessarily the worse for that (on its own terms). Ironically it comes across as a very humanist text and quite saddening (dogs have short, if active, lives). What it does display is the diversity of phenomena ethnomethodology explores, and the diversity of approaches to ethnomethodology. References Jenkings, K.N.
