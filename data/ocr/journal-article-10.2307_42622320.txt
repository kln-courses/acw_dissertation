Exca- vations of tombs during the last decade have established a clear relationship between ruler- ship and ideological themes found in Moche art. There is no doubt that Moche elite par- ticipated in politically charged rituals em- bedded in an ideological framework, which were reiterated throughout the works of art. What has remained underdeveloped in Moche studies is an understanding of the relation- ship of the production of art to political orga- nization. This paper explores the relationship from the perspective of the Moche ceramic workshop located at Cerro Mayal, in the Chicama Valley (fig. i). We will present data concerning the orga- nization and affiliation of ceramic manufac- ture at Cerro Mayal to suggest how produc- tion was part of the broader political strategies of ruling elite. Next, we review the kinds of ceramics manufactured at Cerro Mayal and how they were used. Finally, contextualizing the workshop's organization and sociopolitical affiliation, we postulate the manner in which ceramics were distributed and address re- lationships of patronage and imagery. Cerro Mayal appears to have been an attached workshop enjoying some form of patronage support for the manufacture of ceramics. Our evidence points to the adjacent civic-ceremonial center of Mocollope as the probable locus of Cerro Mayal's support. Archaeological evidence from these sites, in combination with data from colonial-era docu- mentary sources, allows us to suggest the nature of the relationship between Moche leaders at Mocollope and Moche artisans at Cerro Mayal. Situated on a rocky outcrop approximately 4 km from the Chicama River, Cerro Mayal lies in the center of the lower valley amidst fields watered by a complex system of irriga- tion canals (fig. 2). Mocollope itself includes a series of platforms and enclosures nestled into the side of a mountain known as Cerro Mocollope (Gálvez and Briceño, this volume, fig. 10). Evidence for monumental architec- ture at this site dates at least as early as Galli- nazo times, roughly 200 b.c.-a.d. 200, when massive terraced platforms layering the lower mountain slopes were erected (Leonard and Russell 1992; Russell, Attarian, and Becerra, 1999; Russell, Leonard and Briceño 1994, 1997). Cerro Mocollope was undoubtedly the focus of religious beliefs for the inhabitants of the area, visible as it was for miles across the fertile floodplain of the Chicama Valley. At the time of the workshop's occupation (a.d. 550-800), Mocollope must have been a sprawling urban or semiurban center with the ceramic workshop located on its periphery. It is difficult to arrive at an understanding of the nature of political organization in Moche times because of the lack of contem- porary texts. For the Moche, we must rely 159</page><page sequence="3">i . Cerro May al in the Chicama Valley. The archaeological site is now surrounded by sugarcane fields and modern constructions (foreground) 2.

We argue in this paper, however, that evidence from documents dating to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries pertaining to this region may be used to aid in the construction of a general model outlining Moche social and political organization. We know from archaeological evidence that canal irrigation came early to the Chicama Valley, probably by Cupisnique times, approximately 900-800 b.c., and was well established by the Moche period (Kus 1972: 47-48; Lanning 1967: 109; Pozorski 1987: ni; Willey 1953: 362). This system of canal irrigation was fundamental to the development of complex, stratified society in the valley. Additionally, we believe that extended clans, analogous to highland allyus,1 were the basic social units in the Chi- cama Valley, as they were throughout much of the Andes. We suggest that the territorial lands associated with each group were defined to large extent by the outlines of the irrigation canals and other prominent land- marks. We know that this was true for the Chicama Valley in the period immediately preceding, and just after, the Spanish con- quest, and it seems reasonable that some simi- lar system, although perhaps more limited in scale, was also in place during Moche times. Political Economy and Context Extended clans and their associated lands translated into political units, which are here referred to by their colonial designation, par- cialidades. Data from early colonial adminis- trative records indicate how the parciali- dades may have been hierarchically arranged. For example, we know that families of elites ruled specific territories by well-established custom and tradition, entitling them to a variety of special privileges (Cabello Valboa 195 1 [1586]; Rostworowski de Diez Canseco 1961). Lineage clans controlled the valleys in a pyramidal hierarchy. Common farmers were obligated to make tribute payments to their local lord, who was called a principal, who in turn owed tribute to a higher level lord, or cacique ,2 who himself usually owed tribute to an even higher-status paramount lord, or cacique principal (Larco Hoyle 1939: 132; Netherly 1977: 131; Rostworowski de Diez Canseco 1961). Although these relation- ships can only be documented to the near- conquest period, the model they provide can be applied to the earlier Moche period and helps us to contextualize the production of specialized products like ceramics. Rostworowski de Diez Canseco (1961) points out that political succession was hereditary, but not strictly linear. Possession of a territory (or cacicazgo) was usually passed to a brother or son. In cases where no obvious candidate was apparent, however, leadership could be passed to another capable person, though at the highest levels it is doubtful how often this may have occurred. Netherly (1977: 183-191) notes that it was common for high level caciques to assign leadership of smaller parcialidades under their control to brothers and sons as a means of reinforcing political control. The uncer- tainty of succession must have played some part in what appear to have been frequent armed conflicts. It may also have underscored an ongoing or continual need for a system of reciprocal kinship obligations. Simultaneously, the hierarchy, with its built-in system of enforced social responsi- bilities and kinship ties, allowed for overall social continuity even in the face of uncertain transitions of political power. Intravalley dy- namics for the Chicama Valley are described in detail by Netherly (1977, 1984) as having been subdivided along a complex pattern of dominant and lesser social units (or paired moieties), whose boundaries were generally defined by the irrigation canals, and whose hierarchy ascended in a dual pyramid fashion. Translated into political units, each territory was conceptually paired with a second terri- tory, forming a moiety. Paramount lords of each polity were complemented by a "second" lord, the ruler of the lesser moiety (also called a segunda persona, or segundo ) who func- tioned as a "first lieutenant" in dealing with the affairs of specific territories. Each of these lords, in turn, was owed allegiance by a pair of lesser moieties, or parcialidades, and so on. The term parcialidad was applied to almost any coherent group of people, yet a parci- alidad 's position within the hierarchy, and hence the status of its leader, was determined by the number of its members and the type of craft specialization they possessed (Netherly 1977: 160-162). Tribute was marked by tax- ation in the form of labor or goods, and goods were redistributed in reciprocal fashion. RUSSELL AND JACKSON l6l</page><page sequence="5">3 . Diagram of the hierarchy of Chicama Valley moieties in 1565 Based on Netherly 1984: table 1 Thus, in common with other parts of the Andean region, economic integration was achieved by the reciprocal exchange of goods and services, rather than by a system of mar- kets. This type of social organization created unified valleywide polities capable of sustain- ing long-lasting alliances with neighboring valleys even when specific leaders changed (Castillo and Donnan 1994). As these al- liances were not necessarily voluntary, and some valleys appear to have been annexed as a result of military conquests, it also created a built-in system of checks and balances, thus making continuous jockeying for political ascendancy both necessary and endemic. Netherly was able to identify specific sec- tions of lands in the Chicama Valley that were associated with specific lords and clarify their relationships. Figure 3 is a diagram of the hierarchy of Chicama moieties in 1565 based on Netherly's research. As she describes it, the Chicama polity, the overarching corpo- rate group, encompassed most of the Chi- cama Valley, with the exception of certain areas such as the lands near Licapa and Paiján, in the northern part of the valley (fig. 4). We suggest that Mocollope was the seat of the paramount lord of the Chicama polity during the period associated with Moche I-IV ce- ramics. The Chicama polity was divided into four subgroups, or parcialidades, organized into two paired moieties: the dominant moie- ty to the north of the Chicama River, and the lesser moiety to the south. These moieties were bounded and defined by major canal arteries whose maintenance and waters were the responsibility and entitlement of the associated landholders.3 Using the parameters laid out by Netherly in her description as to which lords were asso- ciated with what territories in the early con- quest period (Netherly 1984: 231-232), Mo- collope and Cerro Mayal would have been in the northern moiety of the Chicama polity. Further, it appears that they would have been part of the personal lands of the paramount lord, or cacique principal, of the Chicama polity. In Figure 4 we present a hypothetical reconstruction of the major four parciali- dades comprising the Chicama polity.4 Begin- ning with Netherly's diagram of the main canals in the sixteenth century, we have modi- fied the map by adding shaded areas roughly corresponding to the locations of the four main political subdivisions that she describes. Although the number, hierarchical relation- ships and general locations of these parciali- dades can be reconstructed, the exact location of the boundaries between them are unclear. We know that parcialidades were orga- nized principally by economic activity. Given the agricultural basis of the economy, most parcialidades were made up of farmers and their dependents. Occupational specialists such as fishermen and artisans, however, were also grouped into such units under their own 162 RUSSELL AND JACKSON FIRST SECOND MOIETY MOIETY Don Juan de Don Pedro Mora Mache "Cacique "Segunda Principal of Persona of Chicama V."

The ceramic specialists of Cerro Mayal, for example, probably constituted their own parcialidad. Shimada's data from Pampa Grande may indi- cate a similar type of organization of artisans in the Late Moche period (Shimada 1994, 1998), as does the evidence from the ceramic workshop at the site of Moche (Armas, Chamorro, and Jara 1993,- Uceda, Mujica, and Morales 1997). Christopher Donnant recent excavation of a fisherman's village at Dos Cabezas is further evidence of the existence of such economically specialized kin groups in early Moche times (Donnan and Cock 1997). A polity would have been governed by dual leaders (fig. 3). As every polity leader also had his or her own parcialidad, a paramount ruler commanded numerous sublieutenants and their territories, as well as having direct con- trol of at least one parcialidad. A paramount leader therefore exerted power at a micro level in addition to the general management rights he had over other parcialidades below him in the polity hierarchy. For those parci- alidades that were not part of his own per- sonal lands, tribute payments were received based on and through relationships estab- lished with the leaders of the other units. Such relationships could have been based on relatively peaceful social structures of reci- procity, obligation and exchange, but we also know that on occasion warfare and human sacrifice played a significant role in the sociopolitical balance. Under what was essentially a form of patronage, rulers, as patrons, had a responsi- bility to provide goods and services to those under their protection. In exchange, as clients, the farmers and artisans produced whatever goods were required for the fulfillment of their taxation obligations. A workshop of RUSSELL AND JACKSON 163</page><page sequence="7">ceramic specialists, for example, would have kinship obligations to exchange goods with those of their own social level. They would also have a responsibility to give over a por- tion of their output to the next higher-level lord. In the case of Cerro Mayal, it appears that this would have been Mocollope's para- mount lord, who was also the paramount lord of the Chicama polity. He, in turn, would redistribute the ceramics according to his own reciprocal obligations with others of his status level and lower. In other words, power and political relationships extended both ver- tically and horizontally, and patronage of art production was systemically embedded. As mentioned earlier, according to Neth- erly's identification, territorial divisions in the Chicama Valley were defined by the major canals that bounded them. We also know that canal irrigation has significant time-depth in this valley. It is almost certain that these major canals were in use by Moche times and were associated with a system of hierarchically arranged corporate kin-based landholding units similar to those still in existence in later times. The application of a model generated from sixteenth-century data to a culture a millen- nium earlier is not without risk, but it pro- vides a useful framework for the interpre- tation of archaeological data. The model proposed here should be considered as hypo- thetical. Further substantiation will require archaeological testing, such as the excavation of canals and settlements to establish time- depth and continuity between the Moche, Chimú, and early Conquest periods. The Site of Cerro Mayal With this socioeconomic model in mind, it is useful to review the data from excavations of the workshop itself. The workshop consists of an area of approximately 9,000 m2, with a central area of dense debris in excess of 5,000 m2. It was clearly a large nucleated workshop. Carbon- 1 4 samples indicate that the ceramic workshop was a single-phase production site in use only during the mid to late Moche period, from roughly a.d. 5 50 to 880 (Attarian 1996: 15-16, Table 2.1). Based on our field- work, it is possible to describe the nature and spatial organization of activities at the work- shop (fig. 5). These data, along with the arti- facts and features recovered, allow us identify the products manufactured, interpret the affiliation of the producers and the intensity of production. Aided by the use of cesium magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar surveys (Russell 1998), we were able to determine the loca- tion of kilns. The kilns were primarily of an open-pit type, sometimes with evidence of surrounding rudimentary adobe brick walls of two or three courses. Additionally, one example of a simple chamber kiln was excavated, which consisted of two parallel rows of adobe bricks set on end with a central chamber approximately 50 cm wide by 1 m long. Kilns were located across the central area of the workshop to take advantage of the wind, which funnels through the small ravine. Interspersed among the kilns were a variety of domestic features, including hearths, floors, deposits of domestic refuse, and evidence of ephemeral structures consist- ing of adobe brick footings and quincha or plastered mat walls. This arrangement clearly indicates that the workshop area was also a domestic area. Analysis of botanical remains at Cerro Mayal indicates that the bulk of the agricul- tural products consumed consisted of maize and beans,- both are high-value storable foods 5 .

Diagnostic sherds, Cerro May al, 1992 field season (Attarian 1996, 1998). In addition, prelimi- nary analysis of faunai remains suggests that camelid meat was also a significant compo- nent of the diet. It seems likely, therefore, that Cerro Mayal was being provisioned with foodstuffs from other groups7 taxation pay- ments. Given that Cerro Mayal is located in the parcialidad that also includes Mocollope, and because these food payments would have been collected and redistributed by a high- level cacique, it is logical to conclude that the paramount lord at Mocollope was the patron of Cerro Mayal. Provisioning a workshop such as Cerro Mayal would have represented a sizable economic burden, and in exchange for such a heavy level of economic patronage, the majority of the ceramic output from the site may have been given over directly to the lord of Mocollope. Cerro Mayal was a large specialized work- shop where the potters both lived and worked. Although it is not clear if their production was full- or part-time, the only evidence for craft production of any kind was of ceramic manufacture. This pattern continued for a period of approximately two hundred years in late Moche times. While there is no obvious physical restriction of access to the work- shop, this should not be confused with restriction of access to its products. Based on the evidence of provisioning, the nature of ceramics produced, and its physical prox- imity to Mocollope, it is reasonable to assume that much of the production there was embedded in a system of patronage, and that the workshop at Cerro Mayal was an attached workshop. Cerro Mayal Ceramics A closer consideration of the variety and rela- tive quantities of ceramic forms produced provides insight into the nature and purpose of their creation and use. The ceramics manu- factured at Cerro Mayal were typically made from a very fine orange paste, which we refer to as fineware. There was little or no apparent production of coarse-tempered cooking ware or large storage vessels. While the ceramics were clearly not utilitarian, in the sense that they were not used for everyday cooking and storage, only a small percentage of the ce- ramics produced at Cerro Mayal could be classified among the finest of Moche wares. These very fine Moche wares characteristi- cally show an increased attention to icono- graphie and formal detail, multiple layers of slip paint with a high degree of surface polish, and thin-wall construction techniques. Most of the ceramics produced at Cerro Mayal were made of a high-quality paste, but demonstrate a less labor-intensive manufacturing process than the highest-end ceramics. The majority, if not all, of the Cerro Mayal ceramics were probably used in ritual activities; the ceramic production center here was essential in pro- viding appropriate vessels and figurines for the ritual cycles of Moche life. We recovered and analyzed 139,240 sherds from the 1992 field season. Of these, 91.5 percent were fragments of undetermined RUSSELL AND JACKSON 165</page><page sequence="9">ceramic forms. The remaining 8.5 percent, or 11,793 sherds, had some type of diagnostic characteristic, such as a rim or handle, which allowed us to assign them to a form category. As Figure 6 shows, these included basins, bottles, jars, floreros (flaring vases), figurines, tools and other items. No whole vessels were found, although we did find some whole figu- rines and molds. We suggest that the workshop at Cerro May al produced ceramic objects suitable for a variety of special events and rituals. The ce- ramics themselves, combined with our under- standing of Moche social structures, give clues as to what some of those events may have been. Accordingly, we have divided the ceramics into four main groups, which we believe correlate to different functions within Moche rituals. These are the music and musical instrument group, the figurines and talismans group, ritual serving and con- sumption vessels, and a final group of tools and " other. " The ceramic forms most obviously tied to ritual practices are the musical instruments (figs. 7-10). These include rattles, whistles, trumpets, and drums, as well as depictions of people playing those instruments. Overall, the music cluster comprises just over 1 per- cent of all diagnostic sherds. Even though these sherds represent only a small propor- tion of the overall production, we believe this category is significant in terms of under- standing how ceramics were used. We suggest they were intended for use in various rituals during life, and then ultimately interred.5 Colonial period sources from both the coast and the highlands suggest that music and dancing were important aspects of Andean ritual life. In Moche iconography, musicians are often shown as members of processions. The depictions seem to repre- sent specific types of processions, which scholars have named the Dance of the Dead and the Ribbon Dance (Donnan 1982; Hoc- quenghem 1987; Jiménez Borja, 1938, 195 1; Muelle 1936). A number of the figurines from Cerro Mayal appear to depict individuals similar to those seen in the processions (fig. 7). In other musically related examples, male or female individuals are shown with their eyes closed, as if in a trance, holding or play- ing rattles or drums. One such person, a female, is shown in Figure 8. Males are also depicted as rattle-players, as in Figure 9. Trumpets and drums complete the musical instrument assemblage (fig. 10). The items in the group we identify as fig- urines and talismans were probably used in life prior to final placement in graves. This group numbers 1,233 sherds or whole speci- mens, or ii percent of the total diagnostic 7.

Large hollow female figurine Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo 12. Solid nude female figurines Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo sample. Larger versions (io cm and taller) are generally hollow while the smaller ones are solid. The majority of the Cerro Mayal figu- rines represent females, shown both clothed and nude (figs. 11-13). In absence of visible genitalia, determination of gender is based on formal characteristics previously established within the Moche iconographie corpus, gener- ally costume elements. For example, males are usually associated with warrior parapher- nalia, loincloths, short tunics and elaborate headdresses. Clothed females generally do not wear headdresses, and are shown wearing long tunics with a rounded neckline, with their hair in two long hair braids, and often with pendant earrings (Hocquenghem and Lyon 1980; Jackson 2000: 75). Male figures comprise only about 4 percent of the total sample of figurines from Cerro Mayal (fig. 14). Males are represented as warriors and occa- sionally as bound prisoners. Some of the figurines were extremely small. The tiniest ones, 3 cm or less in height, typically had holes punched in them, allow- ing them to be suspended as pendants. Most of these miniature perforated forms depict humans in abbreviated form - that is, they are usually rendered as just a head with tiny feet and minimal reference to the body's mid- section (fig. 15). Tiny representations of ani- mals and fruits are also present in the sample. We have grouped figurines with pendants because we see a conceptual similarity in terms of how both types of item were proba- bly used. It is possible that these ceramics were destined to be part of a shaman's mesa (collection of objects for healing rituals), or RUSSELL AND JACKSON 1 6j</page><page sequence="11">perhaps they were intended for use by local- level religious practitioners. They may have functioned at the household level, in peti- tions to deities for protection, fertility or health, prior to their ultimate use as grave goods. Their modest form and diminutive scale suggest that they were intended for per- sonal ritual use. The majority of vessels produced at Cerro Mayal are ritual serving and consumption vessels. These represent 76 percent of all diagnostic sherds. We suspect that most of the nondiagnostic sherds were also once part of hollow vessel forms. As complete vessels are rare in workshops, we have approximated the form range of the Cerro Mayal assemblage using the Virú Valley typology formulated by Strong and Evans (1952). Figure 16 is a recon- struction of the basic forms present at Cerro Mayal. Medium to tall necked jars are the 14. Solid male warrior figurine Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo most common ceramic form in the ritual serving and consumption vessel group. These were usually anthropomorphized through the addition of a press-molded or appliquéd face in the area of the vessel neck (fig. 17). Globu- lar jars with short everted necks were com- mon (fig. 18). We also found lids of an appro- priate size for these jars. These lids were typically pierced to facilitate tying. Another 1 3 . Solid clothed female figurines Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo frequent vessel type is a straight-neck bottle with strap handle, a form that was commonly decorated with a scowling face (fig. 19). In other cases, entire vessel bodies were sculpted to represent both human heads and bodies, perhaps as portraits of individuals (fig. 20, • see also Donnan, this volume). In many cases vessels were embellished through the addition of separately modeled appliqué ele- ments, as evinced by numerous appliqué molds at Cerro Mayal. These figures are among the most delicately detailed ceramics. They wear elaborate headdresses, distinctive costumes, and refer to the larger iconographie repertory of Moche nobility, warriors and prisoners (figs. 21-24). Other vessel forms included dippers (also known as cancheros), goblets, ker os (cylindrical drinking vessels), and floreros (fig. 25). It should be noted that although we call these serving and consumption vessels, not all would have been particularly useful for eating and drinking. Vessels such as floreros or stir- rup-spout bottles are impractical for ordinary use - the floreros tip easily and the stirrup- spout bottles are difficult to fill and pour - and may have been intended mainly for funerary rituals or other limited ceremonial activity. Their role may have been more litur- gical within the context of specific rituals. 1 5 .

This group, consisting of 1,451 sherds, represents 12 percent of the total sample. Molds are the dominant form in this category, with molds or mold fragments making up 88 percent of this category. Other ceramic craft- ing tools include turnettes (sometimes called "bats"), and clay mixing vessels. Also in this category are a small number of specialized domestic forms such as spoons and spindle whorls, which were probably for the personal use of the potters. Mold use at Cerro Mayal was more com- plex and technically sophisticated than we first imagined, given the evidence of the pub- lished literature available in the 1980s and 1990s. It has long been known that two-piece molds were used to produce some types of Moche ceramics (Donnan 1992; Larco Hoyle 1945). These molds essentially comprised the front and back sides of a vessel's main cham- ber. Yet, based on the evidence from Cerro Mayal, it is clear that in addition to one or two-part molds, Moche artists were com- bining a variety of other molding and hand- modeling techniques to achieve an impres- sively high degree of complex artistry (Jack- son 1993). Molds were an integral part of a long hand-building tradition on the north coast, a tradition refined by the Moche to include multiple-part molds and complex joinery. Our findings concur with Sergio Purin's (1983) x-ray analyses of several Moche vessels, indicating multiple-part construc- tion. At Cerro Mayal, bottles, jars, figurines, musical instruments, pendants, and masks were constructed either partially or entirely with the aid of molds. It is notable that Moche ceramists em- ployed molds for many of the finest items. One important motivation of attached RUSSELL AND JACKSON 169</page><page sequence="13">AT left: 2i.

Portrait vessel mold (right) and impression Instituto Nacional de Cultura, La Libertad, Trujillo specialization is the desire of elites to control critical symbols and other elements of cos- mology (Brumfiel and Earle 1987). In addition to economy of scale and mass production, molds allow for the standardization and con- trol of iconographie information. Although mold technology probably did simplify cer- tain aspects of ceramic production, molds were apparently not used as a means to in- crease production speed. In fact, in many cases, mold use actually added steps to the production process. Molded items may have been especially prized for the inclusion of spe- cific iconic motifs. A "master" artist's status was doubtless tied to his or her level of access to special esoteric knowledge and his or her ability to translate that knowledge into visual form correctly. Molds played a critical role in assuring that an icon's essential pictorial ele- ments were included in any given depiction and allowed for the widespread dissemination of ideologically linked imagery. Therefore, the use of molds was integral to the construc- tion of representation and meaning, rather than a secondary by-product resulting from technical processes.6 Patronage Relationships Finally, we wish to consider how the produc- tion and distribution of ceramics from Cerro Mayal may be understood in terms of strate- gies of power. Based on what we know about Andean ancestor veneration, the living were never really separated from the spirit world; the two worlds were envisioned as constantly intersecting (Ramirez 1996). Ceramics were undoubtedly critical in the maintenance of symbolic communication between two worlds. Ritual ceramics may have been in- tended to serve multiple functions and carry multiple meanings. That is, they were in- tended to be used among the living while simultaneously carrying messages to the spirit world. While the majority of fancy Moche ceramics extant were found in funer- ary contexts, we cannot assume that this type of ceramic was made for the sole purpose of funerary offerings. The model of sociopolitical organization of the valley suggests that the system was some- what competitive and decentralized, with ongoing maintenance of human and spirit 25.

Individual caciques main- tained a measure of autonomy, while ideology and ritual served as a powerful glue to hold the system together. It was a system made up of a series of reciprocal and hierarchical re- lationships that were codified in ritual. The reciprocal relationships operated both verti- cally and horizontally; between the rulers and the ruled, as well as between the living and the ancestors. In order to maintain the hierar- chy it was necessary for all to follow properly the correct protocols and ritual structures. By making offerings of food, drink, and music to the ancestors on ritual occasions the recipro- cal relationship between the dead and the living was maintained. The rulers stressed their link with the ancestors, whose favor was considered necessary for the continued wellbeing of the community. Because leadership's role included success- ful maintenance of sociopolitical relation- ships, as well as maintenance of the commu- nity's religious obligations to the ancestors, it is perhaps not surprising that the manufacture and distribution of ceramic objects, as one of the most important classes of ritual para- phernalia, was worthy of economic invest- ment. As Susan Ramirez (1996: 162) points out, the relationship between temporal and supernatural legitimacy was politically linked to religious and economic sponsorship of artisans. Using the sociopolitical model described previously, we can propose that the distribu- tion of ceramics was embedded within the hierarchy. For example, the local-level leader of Cerro Mayal would have owed a produc- tion quota to the higher-level lord of Mocol- lope, who in turn supported production. The lord of Mocollope would then redistribute these products down the hierarchy through reciprocal obligations and status-display at ritual events. Labor and goods flowed up the hierarchy,- ceramics and other items flowed down the hierarchy. Patronage relationships in various cultures generally conform to one of four arrange- ments (Thapar 1992; Williams 1981). Patron- age can be a deliberate act of choice, as when a community decides to donate wealth and labor toward the building of a religious monu- ment and where the patron is not a single person but a group. Patronage can also be a public activity where the material value of the object is determined by the patrons. In some instances, patronage can be a service exchange, where the recipient becomes a retainer or is directly commissioned by a patron to produce an object of value. Or, patronage can be an exchange system that is embedded in a society; patrons and recipients are built into the system. Hence, under a political strategy involving obligatory reci- procity, artistic patronage at Cerro Mayal would have been systemically embedded. Based on what we know of other pre- Columbian polities whose strategies of power involved the use of ideologically loaded imag- ery, we might expect to see an iconography of patronage involving relatively overt manipu- lation of imagery. This would include, for example, the commissioning of artworks whose purpose was to give direct testimony of the ruler's fulfillment of obligations associ- ated with leadership - glorifying and legiti- mating the ruler or patron in a relatively straightforward way. We see this in certain contexts, such as in the warfare iconography on the architectural reliefs at the El Brujo complex (Gálvez and Briceño, this volume) and elsewhere (Jackson 2000: 35-60). Data from Cerro Mayal, however, show us that at this workshop such references were relatively rare. Even though some examples of portraits, captive prisoners, and elaborately costumed elites were retrieved there, they were not the principal subject at Cerro Mayal. For what- ever reason, iconographie references to indi- viduals or glorious deeds, if present, remain relatively oblique. Status displays among subpolities, while supporting the creation of political hierar- chies, would also serve to create hierarchies internal to the various professional disci- plines of craft specialists; in other words, this type of patronage arrangement created a situ- ation whereby "master" artisans could arise. It seems likely that these master artisans, bound by the ties and obligations of their respective clans, would have necessarily re- mained attached to specific patrons, and the products of their clientage would have been available to the patron for redistribution, thereby serving to reinforce the leadership of the dominant polity. We hypothesize that theMÉominance of vari- ous clans was formalized in the hierarchy of 172 RUSSELL AND JACKSON</page><page sequence="16">parcialidades , which was both self-sustaining as well as self-adjusting over time. The wax- ing and waning fortunes of any given parci- alidad or cacique would have given rise to, and been fed by, ongoing rivalries. Elites of Mocollope may have compared themselves to elites at the El Brujo complex, Moche or Paña- marca as part of a hierarchy of polities en- gaged in subtle competition with each other. In instances where outright conflict was inap- propriate, this competition would have been most visible in the production, acquisition and maintenance of art and architecture, and in the production of lavish feasts and ritual celebrations. Individual leaders7 successes in achieving dominance bred further triumphs, leading, in turn, to increased demand for elite-status objects such as the fineware ceramics produced at Cerro Mayal. NOTES i . The term allyu refers to lineage structures of indi- vidual families who claim descent from a common ancestor, as well as to group lineages associated with specific geographic territories (Harrison 1989; Netherly 1977: 162). 2. Roughly analogous to the highland designation, curaca, cacique described individuals of widely differing levels of ranked status, governing both locally and regionally. Netherly (1977: 3, 131) points out that cacique and cacicazgo are Antillian terms adopted by Spaniards during the colonial period and used to refer to local and middle-level leaders and their territories. 3. The El Brujo complex, located on the coast just north of the Chicama River, was contemporaneous with Mocollope. Following on from Netherly (1984: 233), El Brujo may have been the seat of an allied or complementary moiety within the valley hierarchy. Both sites depended on water from the Cao canals, suggesting a complex relationship in need of further investigation. 4. According to Netherly, the section of lands to the north of the Chicama River from approximately Chocope to the west along the Cao canal, were ruled by a cacique named Alonso Chuchinamo. His segundo, Diego Sacaynamo, is mentioned as pertaining to a smaller parcialidad somewhere within the Cao territory. Chuchinamo owed primary allegiance to Juan de Mora, the paramount lord of the Chicama polity. Netherly suggests that Juan de Mora's personal territory was north of the Chicama River and east (up valley) from Chocope, an area that would have included Cerro Mocollope. Pedro Mache, mentioned as Juan de Mora's segunda persona, along with his vassal, Gonzalo Sulpinamo, is assumed by Netherly to have controlled the lands south of the Chicama River (1984: 231-232). 5. The majority of ceramics excavated under scientific conditions have been found in funerary contexts. We assume, however, that some of these objects were used prior to interment, based on use- wear evidence. 6. Tom Cummins (1994: 159) states that this was also true for the Ecuadorian ceramic traditions of Jama-Coaque, La Tolita, and Bahía.
