Now, due largely to the generosity of Muriel and Philip Berman, this collec- tion belongs to the Museum. Most of the works were collected by the Philadelphian John Phillips, who be- queathed them to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1876, and they constitute one of the oldest collections of drawings in America. To celebrate this important acquisition, the Phila- delphia Museum of Art mounted an exhibition of seventy-nine of the best drawings, selected by Ann Percy. Although there was no time for an accompany- ing catalogue, the importance of this acquisition should not go unrecorded, and it will be the basis of a forthcoming article by Miss Percy in this journal. Among the Italian drawings exhibited were important sheets by Parmigianino, Barocci, F. Salviati, T. Zuc- caro, Lanfranco, Castiglione, A. de Leone, Ferri, Batoni, Diziani, G. B. Tiepolo, Canaletto, Piranesi, and the Gandolfi. Diane De Grazia Les voyages secrets de Monsieur Courbet: Unbekannte Reiseskizzen aus Baden, Spa, und Biarritz. Exhibition catalogue by Klaus Herding and Katharina Schmidt, 1984. (Staatliche Kunsthalle, Baden-Baden and Kunsthaus, Zurich). 341 pages, 489 plates and illus. In April 1956 and on subsequent occasions, Paul Reverdy, grandson of Zoe Courbet and Jean-Eugene Reverdy, parted with a large group of drawings, watercolors, and oil sketches, which had been in his family for as long as he could remember, and were presumed to be from the hand of his great-uncle Gustave Courbet. Some of these works were shown in two gallery exhibitions in Marseille (1957 and 1964), where they received little more than local attention. In the early I980's, however, the drawings were "redis- covered" by Klaus Herding, who at that point was able to trace 209 drawings and watercolors, and thirty- three oil sketches in a number of private collections. Selections from Herding's find were shown in two exhibitions in Baden-Baden and Zurich during the first half of I984. On the occasion of these exhibitions Herding and co-author Katharina Schmidt published Les voyages secrets de Monsieur Courbet, which does not merely concern the drawings in the exhibitions but reproduces, describes and analyzes all the drawings, watercolors, and oils from the "Fonds Reverdy" known to the authors at that time.1 This review will primarily address the book but is also based on a visit to the Zurich exhibition. The overriding initial impression one receives when considering the body of drawings reproduced in the book is their enormous variety in subject matter: travel sketches; studies of trees, rocks, plants, and animals; portrait drawings; caricatures and cartoons; copies after the masters; renderings of buildings and furni- ture; drapery studies; and a nude. Surprising, more- over, to anyone familiar with Courbet's graphic work, is the variety of techniques and media, including watercolor and washes, which are hitherto unknown in his ceuvre.2 Even the white highlights used in several of the newly discovered sheets occur only sporadically in Courbet's known drawings, which are generally done in charcoal, black chalk, pencil, or mixtures thereof. [ 455 ] REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS The majority of the drawings in the Fonds Reverdy fall into the category of croquis-rapid notations of visual impressions or ideas-but there are also some carefully finished drawings (dessins), which include three highly detailed academic drapery studies (cat. nos. I Io0-2); a study of a beech tree (no. 169); and two watercolors of historic interiors in Baden-Baden (nos. 163 and 164). A third category of drawings occupies a place between croquis and dessin. These are mostly sketches of historic buildings, carefully drawn in pen- cil or black chalk, and occasionally touched-up with washes or watercolor (e.g., nos. I, 22, 62, 63, 92, I50, 152, 207). If this newly discovered body of drawings, water- colors, and oil sketches is indeed from the hand of Courbet, their discovery is an important one, as it more than doubles the number of drawings by Cour- bet presently known (or nearly quintuples it if we ex- clude the drawings in Courbet's three extant sketch- books in the Louvre, which for the most part are on a much smaller scale). It must alter our notion of Cour- bet as an artist averse to drawing and force us to sub- stantially expand our perception of the range of his drawing modes, media, and subject matter. It will also necessitate a rethinking of Courbet's relationship to and preferences for older art and it will add many un- known data to Courbet's biography-both as far as the places he visited and the company he kept are con- cerned. The attribution of the drawings in the "Fonds Reverdy" to Gustave Courbet is based first of all on their provenance and is further corroborated by the fact that certain motifs that occur in the drawings like- wise occur in Courbet's Louvre sketchbooks, particu- larly R.F. 9105. In order to emphasize this similarity, a richly illustrated essay devoted to this sketchbook and written by Louvre curator Helene Toussaint has been added to the book.3 From a stylistic point of view, Courbet as a draughtsman was known till now primarily for his large, bold charcoal drawings of figures and an occa- sional broadly sketched landscape.4 The authors con- cede that none of the drawings in the "Fonds Reverdy" can be compared with these works, but base their argument of authenticity primarily on a thematic and stylistic comparison with the Louvre sketchbooks- notably R.F. 29234 and R.F. 9Io5-and on a com- parison between the style of some of the landscape drawings with Courbet's landscape paintings. In his introductory essay Herding points in particular to the "anarchistic" element that he detects in both Courbet's drawing and painting styles (pp. 40, 43). Although the argument for Courbet's authorship of the drawings is well presented, one may make a num- ber of observations that contradict this thesis. I. Though the provenance of the drawings is such that, were these sixteenth or seventeenth-century drawings, it would certainly be considered conclusive proof of authorship, our knowledge of the strained relationship between Courbet and his sister Zoe Re- verdy in the artist's later years renders the provenance less decisive as evidence. Zoe's total exclusion from her brother's will caused her to complain in a letter to Champfleury (1879) that ". .. il ne restera pas un tableau, pas un chiffon, rien, rien qui rappelle que Courbet nous a appartenu."5 Though at a later time a few paintings by Courbet were restored to her,6 we know of no specific transaction whereby she or her heirs regained the possession of a considerable group of drawings and oil sketches by Courbet. It must furthermore be pointed out that Zoe's own husband, Jean-Baptiste-Eugene-Cesar Reverdy (1822- 1887), was a painter as well. A student ofMichel-Martin Dr6lling, he made his debut at the Salon of 1847 with portraits of M. le Marquis V. . de S. . and Mme la Marquise J. . de S. .. Another portrait of M. F.. de S. . was seen at the Salon of 1848. He subsequently became the curator and restorer of the art collection of the Marquis de Saint-Denys, whose portrait he had submitted to the Salon previously. In his service Reverdy traveled a good deal, to accompany the Marquis himself as well as members of his family.7 In light of the above, the provenance of the drawings becomes a less decisive proof of Courbet's authorship, as it may well point to Reverdy. This argument is supported by the fact that two of the drawings can directly be related to Reverdy. Catalogue no. Io8, which is dated 1854, contains five small portraits of men, two of which are identified as Reverdy and Reverdy le pere (?). Number 195 bears the inscription, atelierq M [456 ]</page><page sequence="3">1 7eme and the date 1861. In the entry for the drawing it is pointed out that 17 Quai Malaquais was Reverdy's address in the i86o's and the possibility of his author- ship is alluded to. Yet, this suggestion is rejected in favor of the attribution, on stylistic grounds, to Courbet. It must be pointed out, however, that it is highly unlikely that Courbet made either this or the previous drawing, as he did not know Reverdy until late 1867. In a letter to his parents written onJanuary 9, 1868, at the occasion of Zoe's announced marriage to Reverdy (with whom she had lived in concubinage for at least ten years), he wrote specifically: "Quant a Mr Reverdy, je ne le connais pas. II me dit qu'il est peintre, je n'aijamais vu de sa peinture, mais il a heureusement une autre position que j'ignore."8 Two other drawings may also be the work of Reverdy. Number 130 is a caricature of a young man shaving, identified as F. de S., which may well refer to the same member of the Saint-Denys family whose portrait by Reverdy had been exhibited at the Salon of 1848 (see above). Number 208, according to its title, represents the chateau Le Breau, which belonged to the Saint-Denys family, members of which are known to have used the surname, DuBreau or Du Breuil. The drawing bears the date of 1871, a year in which Reverdy must have visited the castle, as a letter he wrote from there is dated June 13, 1871 (Paris, Biblio- theque Nationale). This fact is noted in the catalogue and the possibility that Reverdy may have been the drawing's author is once again raised and rejected, this time in part because the paper on which the drawing is made has the same watermark as many others in the group. One could obviously turn the argument around and use the watermark as an indication that all those other drawings are likewise by Reverdy. 2. Many of the drawings are provided with inscrip- tions. Some of these have obviously been added to the drawings at a later date, but most of them clearly were written by the same person who made the drawing, as they show the same writing instrument and / or are the kind of notations (e.g., relating to color) that only the artist himself would write on a drawing. A careful comparison of the handwriting on the drawings and the handwriting of Courbet, as seen in his letters or the Louvre sketchbooks, reveals that the first-named handwriting is not Courbet's.9 Though one would obviously need the services of a handwriting expert to turn this argument into conclusive evidence, the differ- ences between the handwriting on the drawings and Courbet's script, as known from his authenticated drawings and numerous letters, are sufficiently strik- ing for even a non-specialist to observe. To mention just a few examples, Courbet never gave a downward tail to an x at the end of a word, as is seen in the drawings (e.g., nos. 20, 22, 66, 85, I05). He wrote his 5 in the way it is commonly written today, and not, as seen in the drawings, as a long stretched-out s. Unlike the d in Courbet's handwriting, which is mostly un- connected to the next letter and generally has an open loop, one frequently sees the lower case d in the draw- ings connected with the next letter with a closed loop from the top (e.g., nos. I, 2, 3, 10, 38, etc.). As well, Courbet used capitals sparingly and often inconsis- tently and was weak in orthography, whereas in the inscriptions on the drawings capitalization and spelling are by and large correctly applied. It is moreover remarkable that none of the draw- ings, even the more finished ones, are signed or ini- tialed, as many of Courbet's drawings are (even at times those in the sketchbooks). On the other hand, most of the travel sketches in the "Fonds Reverdy" are dated, in marked contrast to the ones found in Cour- bet's sketchbooks, which-to the frustration of Cour- bet students-lack even a single date. It may be noted here in passing that the stamp Hoirie Courbet, Fonds Reverdy which is found on all drawings, was not placed on them until 1956. 3. Approximately half of the drawings are croquis de voyage. Of these, few, if any, correspond to trips Courbet is known to have taken. Thus, for example, we know of two early trips Courbet took to Belgium in 1846 and 185 I and a possible third one in 1847,10 but nothing is known of a prolonged stay in Spa in 1849 or a trip to Flanders in I850. Similarly, Helene Toussaint in her catalogue essay presents conclusive evidence (through entries in the Badener Badeblatt) that Courbet stayed in Baden in I842 and I844, and she convinc- ingly assigns the drawings of Baden in the Louvre sketchbook R.F. 9I05 to the earlier trip (p. 61). Yet, no documentary evidence is found in the Badeblatt, in [457 ] REVIEWS</page><page sequence="4">tl??.l ? ? ?; *,f: .1. ,, *., i??. ,:f" " ;* ;?? ?r. il- r.y.. :E ?*. ?' -w?; .r+ ..- '' ?.?.

Likewise, nothing is known about Courbet's stay in Biarritz in I86I or a stay in Pau in 1864. The title of the exhibition Les voyages secrets de M. Courbet would seem to indicate that for some reason Courbet wanted these trips to remain unknown. Such discretion, however, is diffi- cult to reconcile with the current assessment of Cour- bet's personality. 4. Of the many portrait drawings in the exhibition, few depict persons whom we can relate to Courbet. Omans, Musee Gustave Courbet. The named portraits largely depict persons of nobil- ity-dukes and counts as well as their female counter- parts. The authors have attempted to identify some of the unnamed portraits with Courbet's known friends, specifically Jules Valles (no. 42v), and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (no. 57). The likenesses, however, are un- convincing and the assertion that number 57 depicts Proudhon in prison, while not the slightest indication of a prison setting is present, is speculative to say the least. Aside from the portrait of Reverdy named above, of which Courbet cannot have been the author, [458 ] yowtti'csv"^:'?*;..z , : : . | . : . s .:~~~~~~' ,Ho**. ; ? , t f! ?C?ry?-? --: 'li? ,?-.1 r ci :? ?.4.;21t?:;??.-.(? ..'</page><page sequence="5">only one of the named portraits depicts a person from Courbet's circle. Number I02 includes, among many other sketches, a small head seen from the rear, in- scribed Bruyas. If indeed the drawing depicts Cour- bet's patron, Alphonse Bruyas, it must be remem- bered that as a collector of contemporary art he was on familiar terms with a great many artists. It must also be noted that not only Courbet but also the Reverdys had close connections with Bruyas, as seen from the nu- merous extant letters to Bruyas by Zoe, dating back as far as the early I850's.11 5. Among the drawings in the exhibition is a con- siderable number of copies after old masters. But the majority of these are after paintings by artists that do not seem to have figured among Courbet's favorites. Rather than drawings after Hals, Rembrandt, or Van der Helst, as might be expected, these copies are after works by Niccolo dell' Abbate, Parmigianino, Andrea del Sarto, El Greco, etc. Several reproduce works in the Prado Museum in Madrid, a place that, as far as we know, Courbet never visited. The authors note this fact but suggest that these copies were made after prints. Though this, of course, is possible for the better-known works, it becomes less likely in the case of a little-known work such as the study of a head of an old man, attributed to Velazquez (no. 66), which, to my knowledge, was never reproduced in print. 6. Finally, we must deal with that most difficult and precarious problem-style. The "Fonds Reverdy" includes oil sketches, watercolors, and drawings of different types. For the majority of these types there are no equivalents in Courbet's oeuvre as we know it. Where one does have the opportunity, however, to compare congruous works, i.e. in the portrait draw- ings and the croquis de voyage,12 one notes differences that are so substantial that the authorship of Courbet must be seriously doubted. A particularly unflattering comparison may be made between the portrait draw- ings in the "Fonds Reverdy" and those which can be attributed to Courbet with certainty. Compare, for example, the Portrait of a Womanfrom Baden-Baden (no. 82), dated in the catalogue ca. 1851, with Courbet's Portrait of Zlie (Fernier, no. 38), a drawing of approxi- mately the same size and date (Figs. I and 2). The dryness of execution in the first is startling. The Fig. 3 GUSTAVE COURBET (?) The "Alte Schlosz" in Baden-Baden. Private Collection. schematic rendering of the hair, the uninteresting con- tour of the face, the minimal use of shading, all this makes the drawing far inferior to the Portrait of Zelie or to any of Courbet's drawings of the fifties presently known to us. We may also compare one of the croquis de voyage with those known to us from the sketchbooks. The difference between no. 22, The "Alte Schlosz" in Baden- Baden, and the drawing of the same subject in sketch- book R.F. 9IO5 in the Louvre (fol. 8 recto) (Figs. 3 and 4) is striking. In the former a sense of depth is achieved primarily through perspective; in the latter three- dimensionality is suggested through the chiaroscuro. Where the contours in the first drawing are ruler- straight and uninteresting, Courbet's contours are lively, even to the eroded texture of the stonework. As in all of Courbet's sketchbook drawings, one finds emphasized and non-emphasized contours, as opposed to the uniform contour found in The "Alte Schlosz" and, for that matter, most of the newly discovered drawings. Moreover, the trees and bushes, with their [459 ]</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS Fig. 4 GUSTAVE COURBET. The "Alte Schlosz" in Baden-Baden. Paris, Louvre, Cabinet des Dessins. grotesque shapes, which to Herding suggest a phan- tastic fairy creature and a yelping dog (p. 27), are of a mannerist turn that is difficult to associate with Courbet. 13 Since it appears that the most important drawings in the "Fonds Reverdy" find no equivalent in Courbet's known graphic oeuvre, attribution on stylistic grounds is questionable. The authors would attempt to solve this problem by comparing several of them with Courbet's paintings. Thus, the three drapery studies- worthy of some of the best students of Ingres-are related to the drapery of the model in Courbet's Atelier (Ferier, no. I65), particularly cat. no. IIo which is proposed as a possible study for that painting. Simi- larly, the large finished drawing of a Beechtree (no. 169) is related to The Oaktree of Flagey (Ferier, no. 417). Yet none of the drawings in the "Fonds Reverdy," including these, can be convincingly related to Cour- bet's painted oeuvre. Neither the documentary nor the visual evidence, then, is sufficiently sound to expand the oeuvre of Courbet with 242 works. With all its scholarly appara- tus and careful topographical research, Les voyages Sec- rets de Monsieur Courbet will, one hopes, not be the final word on the drawings and oil sketches from the "Fonds Reverdy," but rather a point of departure for continued research and art-historical debate.

The authors place a good deal of emphasis on the use of "hidden pictures" in the drawings (e.g., nos. 8, 9, 22, 84, 152, I58), which at one point they even refer to as "very characteristic for Courbet" (p. 260). But, so far the only example of this practice in Courbet's art is the Fantastic Land- scape with Anthropomorphic Rocks (private collection), which was first seen at the Courbet exhibition in the Louvre in 1977 (cat. no. 81). There is no unanimous agreement as to the attribution of this painting. David Cox, 1783-I859. Exhibition catalogue by Stephen Wildman with introductory essays by Richard Lockett andJohn Murdoch, 1983-84 (Birming- ham Museums and Art Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum, London). 136 pp., 73 illus., 5 text figs., i8 colorplates. David Cox was born two centuries ago-the son of a metal-worker-at Deritend, a walkable distance from the center of Birmingham. He died in 1859 at Green- field House, Harborne Village, now a residential sub- urb and a short bus journey from the same city. Of both choice and necessity he passed much of his life as a mature artist away from Birmingham, teach- ing in Hereford for a number of years and working in London for two periods of residence, the longer lasting from 1827 until 1841. Cox remains a revered native of the Midlands city, along with Edward Burne-Jones, honoured by an ex- hibition by the Arts Council of Great Britain in I975- 76. It was both predictable and appropriate, in the normal course of events, that Birmingham should stage a major commemorative Cox exhibition (uly 26-October 14, I983) organized by the City Museums and Art Gallery. Cox, however, transcends parochial hagiography as a figure of national status whose achievements demand assessment in any survey of British nineteenth-century art, and the show contin- ued to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (November 9, I983-January 8, 1984), the home of the national collection of British drawings. The last Cox exhibition of any magnitude was also held in his place of birth in 1959 to mark the centenary of the painter's death, and this, understandably, shared a number of exhibits with its successor. Over the last century the City Art Gallery has amassed the largest and most representative collection of the artist's works in all media, a situation not unrelated to the enthusiasm of local collectors and benefactors who have made im- portant gifts and bequests, including the originals of the images famous from the older literature. The last monographs, part of a spate of British publishing after the Second World War, were by Frederick Gordon Roe, Cox the Master: the Life and Art of David Cox 1783-1859 of 1946, followed the next year by David Cox by Sir Trenchard Cox, the former director of both museums taking this show and, as he often had to explain, unrelated to the artist. Since then very little has been published. The basic nineteenth-century biography ofNeil Solly (1873) has been reprinted, and the general student has had avail- able that useful summary of Cox's life-often de- scribed as uneventful-contained in the second vol- ume of Martin Hardie's Water-Colour Painting in Britain. In the catalogue of the exhibition under review, the details of the artist's career are succinctly summarized in a chronology. Historically, this exhibition belongs in a sequence of shows of the last decade or so, of varying scholarly weight, detail, and status, which have been devoted to British nineteenth-century artists. The watercolorists in particular have come under scrutiny. In the present case the selection and the catalogue have been made by Stephen Wildman, a deputy keeper in the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery with responsibility for its Department of Prints and Drawings. He has concen- trated on works available for his inspection in the United Kingdom, and there can be little to criticize in this. Some fine Cox drawings are owned outside the country, with a certain number in the United States, although his representation is not so strong in Ameri- can collections as that of many of his compatriots. The basis for any selection lies in the Birmingham hold- ings, where many items have been specially restored, but this fine nucleus was critically extended by loans from the London national museums, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Tate Gallery, along with the Courtauld Institute Gal- leries, and collections in Oxford, Cambridge, Preston, Hereford, Bury, Manchester, Liverpool, Dudley, Worcester, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Newcastle, and [ 461 ] REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
