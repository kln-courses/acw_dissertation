Göttingen, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1996. 285 p. 16 X 23,5 Although much has been written about the portrayals of God within the book of Hosea, Brigitte Seifert succeeds in shedding some new light on this topic in her dissertation, Metaphorisches Reden von Gott im Hoseabuch. One of the reasons for this is that her work is informed by modern metaphor theory. In the preface, a profoundly theological question is presented as the Leitmotif of the study: Is it possible to speak adequately about God, using human language? Systematic theologians might therefore find interest in this exegetical book. Substantial parts, above all the lengthy discussions of different notions of analogy and revelation (66-85), seem to have been written with such an audience in mind. Indeed, one of the author's explicit aims is to promote the dialogue between Old Testament exegetes and systematic theologians: "die Fragen der alttestamentlichen Exegeten mit denen der Systematiker zu konfrontieren, um - wenn möglich - beide miteinander ins Gespräch zu bringen " (86). The first part of the book deals with metaphor theory. It is, on the whole, informative and well-written. Seiferťs presentation covers a wide span, starting with a brief (perhaps too brief) summary of Aristotle's writings on the subject of metaphor. At an early stage, the reader is introduced to the issues where modern metaphor theory has broken with the inherited view that was taught within classical rhetoric. According to the new consensus that has emerged, metaphors cannot be substituted by allegedly more adequate literal expressions. On the contrary, they have a unique cognitive function. Succinct accounts of the contributions made by some of the most influential writers on this topic in the 20th century - Ivor Richards, Max Black, Monroe Beardsley, Harald Weinrich, and Paul Ricoeur - are supplemented with insightful discussions of the strength and weakness of each theory. A strictly chronological mode of presentation would perhaps have been preferable, but this is of course a marginal note of criticism. For some reason, Seifert has here restricted the scope to literature available in the German language. (This is strange, in the light of the observation that Seifert has used several English works for the exegetical part of her study.) Since the most important studies by Richards, Black and others have been translated into German, this need not be a major</page><page sequence="2">Recensiones 413 disadvantage. Occasionally, however, the author's lack of a direct access to the Anglo-American discussion leads to oddities. For instance, the innovative ideas presented by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their pivotal work Metaphors We Live By (Chicago 1980) are here apparently ascribed to a German New Testament scholar (16). Among Old Testament scholars trying to bring modern metaphor theory to bear on the analysis of biblical metaphors, only a few are mentioned. Seifert maintains that Old Testament scholars have paid relatively little interest to modern metaphor theory and its application; but she fails to mention the contributions made by, among others, D. Bourguet (1987), K. Nielsen (1989), and M. Brettler (1989). Whereas the section devoted to the work of Anders Bjorndalen deals almost entirely with J.B.N. Reichling's linguistic theory, the discussion of Matthias Krieg's study is thorough and thought-provoking. Like several other biblical scholars before her, Seifert opts for Max Black's interaction view as a suitable theoretical basis for the exegetical analysis. The minor modifications made by her seem to be improvements. Black's theory is attractive due to its ability to explain metaphor's genuinely creative capacity. Seifert's study finely demonstrates its applicability to the study of literature (see e.g. the analysis of Hos 7,11-12 on pages 167-170). But does the notion of interaction really offer an apt model for the interpretation of religious metaphors? While arguing that the acknowledgment of God's antecedent self-revelation in history constitutes a presupposition for the correct understanding of biblical metaphors (77, 86), Seifert in fact deprives metaphor of its revelatory force. At the same time, she departs from the common ground of non-confessional scholarly discourse. What is missing in the introduction is a section dealing with questions of authorship, redaction, and composition as regards the object of the analysis, the book of Hosea. A discussion of the setting, or situational context, of this prophetic proclamation would also have been helpful. To some extent this is compensated by the excellently up-dated section on the religious situation during the 8th century BCE in the Northern Kingdom (243-246). But why has this section been placed after the textual analysis, as part of the final chapter which presents the results of the investigation? The bulk of Seifert's book consists of analyses of selected passages from the book of Hosea. Interesting observations are registered on almost every page. It is therefore regrettable that texts from different parts of the book have been grouped together and placed under headings like "Betrogene Liebe", "Drohendes Verderben", or "Unbegreifliches Erbarmen". This arrangement would seem to underestimate the role of the literary context, as well as the degree of thematic and theological complexity of each of the passages treated. At times, moreover, the presentation is flawed by an apologetic tendency, an ambition to reconcile the results of the textual analysis with current theological opinions, or to defend the text's ideology (see e.g. 137-138, where the feminist critique of the marriage metaphor in chs. 1-3 is refuted). However, it is not possible to discuss the exegesis in detail here.</page><page sequence="3">414 Recensiones I find it more worthwhile to concentrate on a critical evaluation of Seiferts concluding statements regarding the function of " god-metaphors " (Gottesmetaphern) within Hosea's prophetic proclamation (250-263). In several instances, these are quite convincing. Thus Seifert is able to draw interesting conclusions from the fact that some metaphors of divine activity are expressed solely by means of a verb. Together with other observations this feature could indicate a conscious resistance (on the part of the prophet/author/redactor) against linking YHWH with a fixed, static representation. By means of its vast array of rapidly changing metaphors. Seifert points out, the book of Hosea highlights the many-sidedness of the one God (259-260). At the same time, the notion of divine transcendence, or radical otherness is safeguarded. In this connection, Seifert (224-225, 263) correctly draws attention to the significance of the saying in Hos 11,9, which seems to serve as a reminder that all anthropomorphic representations of the divine are, in the last resort, inadequate. (Cf. Eidevall, Grapes in the desert: Metaphors , Models, and Themes in Hosea 4- 14 [ConBOTS 43; Stockholm 1996) 229, where a similar point is made.) Seiferťs conclusions are all based on sound observations. In some cases, though, the picture presented is too smooth and symmetrical, too perfected to be true. In real life and literature there is no rule without an exception; but according to Seifert the prophet Hosea's proclamation was governed by strict and absolute rules. It is thus evident that (the author/redactor[s] of the book of) Hosea shows a predilection for similes (using the particles, Mike'), especially when it comes to depictions of YHWH (not infrequently taking the form of divine self-presentations). In other words, the textual material exhibits a tendency to avoid metaphors of the type "YHWH is x". Now, Seifert may well be correct in interpreting this feature as reflecting a conscious reluctance against using utterances that could possibly be misunderstood as implying identity statements concerning the divine nature (251). But there appears to be at least one exception to this rule, in 5,2: "I will be a now to them all". Although the exact translation is uncertain ("chastisement" or "fessel"?), there can be no doubt that this saying should be construed as a divine threat. It is therefore surprising that Seifert (90, 142) declares that it is part of a passage (5,1-7) containing prophetic speech; in other words, that the emphasized "I" refers to the prophet. This interpretation cannot find support in a single Hosea commentary. Indeed, it looks like a desperate attempt to get rid of evidence that might disturb the picture. There is no reason, as I see it, to assume that the accusations in 5,1-2 are delivered in the name of Hosea, rather than in the name of YHWH. And I regard it as even more unlikely that the prophet in 5,3 should claim to be omniscient like God (as implied by Seiferťs proposal!). At one point, Seiferťs effort to present a coherent and systematic picture of Hosea's teachings has led to a gross generalization that fails to do justice to the complexity of the biblical text. She maintains that animal (or: predator) metaphors are employed to depict divine destructiveness, while anthropomorphisms, with the exception of 7,12, are used to describe YHWH's salvific activity, which is seen as the deity's "primary" activity</page><page sequence="4">Recensiones 415 (254-255). Apart from the dubious underlying conception that Hosea or his contemporaries should have regarded theriomorphic and anthropomorphic speech as constituting two distinct categories, this conclusion cannot be sustained by a close examination of the textual material. It is, to begin with, easily demonstrated that destructive divine activity is also described by means of anthropomorphic metaphors in cases other than the fowler metaphor in 7,12. For instance, the deity acts like a judge and/or prosecutor in several passages (e.g. 4,1-3; 5,1-2; 12,1.15). On the other hand, the lion metaphor in 11,10 is part of a proclamation of salvation. The latter problem Seifert " solves " with the help of redaction criticism (226). It is of course possible that the saying in 11;10 (or some part of it) represents a later, or "secondary" addition to the text; but there is no scholarly con- sensus on this issue. If one adds the observation that other Gottesmetaphern that do not seem to fit the picture, (viz. the dew and tree similes in 14,6.9), are likewise held to be "secindary", it is difficult to evade the conclusion that a certain measure of circular reasoning has been involved. The crucial methodological question concerning the criteria for distinguishing between "authentic" and "secondary" passages is not addressed by Seifert. In the light of the recent discussions in this field, her optimism regarding our possibilities of recovering the prophet's ipsissima verba seems unwarranted. These points of criticism, or disagreement, should not be allowed to overshadow the fact that Brigitte Seifert has accomplished an important investigation. The result is an impressive book, which can be recommended not only to biblical scholars specializing in Hosea and to systematic theologians, but to all who are interested in the application of metaphor theory within biblical studies.
