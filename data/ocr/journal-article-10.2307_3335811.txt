<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anjenu: Sculpture for Idoma Water Spirits SIDNEY L. KASFIR Idoma art has proved elusive to scho- lars because of its seemingly disparate elements. I In consequence, it is usually relegated to the status of an Igbo- derived substyle, based solely upon its whiteface mask tradition. In fact this is only one of its elements that have been fused through a complex process of bricolage during a long period of migra- tion and resettlement within the Benue Valley. The anjenu cult can be seen as a con- vergence, in both time and space, of three sets of interrelated beliefs held by nearby peoples and the subsequent adaptation of these to the requirements of Idoma life. These are, first, the well- known Hausa spirit possession cult known as bori; second, cults centered upon other nature spirits such as the Igala alijenu and Abakwariga2 aljanu, widely spread through the Nigerian Middle Belt; and third, the coastal and Cross River belief in water spirits known in Nigeria as Mammy Wata and in Cameroon as liengu. In this sense, an- jenu is a quintessentially Idoma cult, with a northern and a southern compo- nent. (The same is true of Idoma mask- ing institutions, for the same reasons.) Both culturally and geographically, the Niger-Benue Confluence and the Lower Benue Valley constitute a transi- tion zone: it is the interface not only be- tween the largely Muslim North, domi- nated by Hausa-Fulani culture, and a non-Muslim South, deeply affected by missionary Christianity, but also be- tween the two major ecological zones of West Africa, the savannah and the trop- ical forest. It is therefore not surprising that Idoma art should be both an "art of the savannah" and an "art of the forest." While very few Idoma are Mus- lim, they live in a region heavily influ- enced by both pre- and post-Islamic Hausa culture. In particular it is the autochthonous Hausa culture, existing now only as a remnant, that has had a seminal influence upon Idoma cult life. 3 The core of Idoma ethnicity is defined by those kindreds who claim to have left their home in Api near the present-day Jukun town of Wukari during the disin- tegration of the Kwararafa confederacy. However, migrations from eastern Igala and later from the north bank of the Benue during the 19th-century Fulani wars were equally important in creating the mixed present-day population of Idomaland. Igala in particular has shared a common substratum of autochthonous culture with Idoma and has served as an important migration corridor as well. This has resulted in a number of shared beliefs ranging from the ancestral masquerade cult (Idoma alekwuafia, Igala egwuafia) to anjenu (Igala alijenu, ajenu), as well as the diffusion into Idoma of Igala notions of kingship. Finally, a number of groups that now identify themselves as Idoma have come from, or border upon, Ogoja, a multi- ethnic area north of the Middle Cross River. 4 A number of men's societies such as ekpe and ogrinye have diffused into Idoma from this region, and with them their masquerade traditions. Now beliefs concerning Mammy Wata are be- ginning to enter Idoma by this same route. The Idoma belief system, like the art that concretizes it, is not unified around a single concept, but consists of several interlocking sets of ideas concerning various aspects of the supernatural. Like many other African religious sys- tems, it concerns itself mainly with Earth, God, and ancestors, but there is also a less well-defined but pervasive spirit domain associated with "the bush" or what some writers call the Wild. Masked spirits (ekwu) dwell here, outside the settled and cultivated areas. When masquerades appear, they usu- ally emerge from the bush and return to it afterward. This dual metaphor equat- ing human settlement with the world of the living, hence of order and control, and the uncultivated bush with the world of the spirits, disorder and chaos, is pervasive in African traditional thought and is explicit in Idomaland.s It is therefore not surprising that cer- tain morphological features of the bush should be identified as spirit abodes. One of these is water, especially large rivers and turbulent streams. Another is termite mounds, those extraordinary, bori .I NIGERIA HAUSA ALAGO alanu (ionkpa) ABAKWARIGA, JUKUN anienu T alijenu IDOMA IGALA 1 *' OGOJA -* ."1 mammy wata A IBIBIO, ETC.

Anjenu spirits are thought to emanate from both of these places. While the River Benue is consid- ered to be the main abode of anjenu, they also inhabit local streams and are reported to come from as far away as Bar Beach in Lagos. There are two essential characteristics of the anjenu cult in Idoma. One is the belief in a class of nature spirits, anjenu, that have the power to "seize" a person. The symptoms of this seizure may be either dreams of a disturbing nature or, less often, trance states in which the afflicted is temporarily possessed by an- jenu spirits. The second is the appease- ment and propitiation of these spirits (and subsequent curing of the symptoms) through a set of rituals that involve sing- ing, dancing, and sacrifice at a shrine erected to honor anjenu. Such shrines must include bottles of sacred water, the eka medicine calabash, sacrificial food for the spirits to "eat," and frequently (though not always) carved images of the spirits themselves, as well as the mud figure of a lion or a leopard. Perhaps the most striking feature of the cult is the fact that its disciples are mainly women. Unlike many African societies, Idoma assigns very few roles to women in its ritual life. Even post- menopausal women are unimportant in this respect.6 Therefore, their domi- nance in anjenu requires some explana- tion. It is no doubt partly due to the re- cent adoption of the cult, and to its 1. OOJA ODIBO, ANJENU DISCIPLE, WITH A MUD SHRINE SHE MADE. 2. ANJENU SHRINE WITH BOTTLES OF SACRED WATER AND AHANA STOPPERS. 3. CARVER-PRIEST OJIJI AT HIS ANJENU SHRINE. highly syncretistic nature. But there is also the now-familiar pattern of wom- en's involvement in spirit possession cults all over Africa. In this respect it strongly resembles both bori and Mammy Wata. However, it would be an exaggera- tion to state thatanjenu is a women's cult. Most anjenu priests are men, if for no other reason than the fact that Idoma di- vination is a male profession and is es- sential to the diagnosis of anjenu spirits (Fig. 3). While in the case of women, the afflictions.brought on by anjenu are usu- ally related to fertility, they may also be neurotic disorders, such as depression, that occur as readily among men as among women. It also seems to be the case that membership, as R. G. Armstrong noted, "runs in families" and therefore encompasses both sexes.7 But women far outnumber men.8 The other distinctive feature of the cult is the sculptural representation ofanjenu. Perhaps the most interesting aspect for the art historian concerns their deriva- tion from other genres of Idoma art. First of all, their occurrence coincides with the presence of woodcarvers, whose dis- tribution is quite uneven in Idomaland. While there is roughly one carver to every 1,000 people, this is only an aver- age figure and there are some districts, such as Agila, in which carvers are very scarce. In these places, anjenu shrines tend to be bereft of figure sculpture un- less the owner is rich enough to have gone to another district to commission a carving. And by the same argument, shrines belonging to carvers themselves are replete with anjenu figures. One carver-priest in Okwoga has over a dozen images in his personal shrine. An interesting corollary to this is the occa- sional woman disciple who inherits her father's anjenu shrine and turns to mak- 48</page><page sequence="3">4.

Under certain circumstances (in this case, the artist being her own pa- tron), Idoma women may be allowed to intrude into an otherwise exclusively male domain of creativity. The syncretistic nature of the cult is nowhere so evident as in the variety of images seen in anjenu shrines. There are three main types of sculpture: modeled mud figures of lions; carved male, female, and leopard figures; and carved stoppers placed in bottles of sacred water or in the eka medicine calabash, the shrine's most powerful emblem (Fig. 4). 9 In the calabash neck is usually found the image of the white-bellied stork (oklakla), while small anthropomorphic heads project from the water bottles. These water spirits, usually called ahana, are as varied and numerous as the carver's im- agination permits, and are thus respon- sive to social change (Fig. 2). In the shrine of one innovative carver, they in- cluded a messenger, a soldier, an "in- formation officer," and a female doctor wearing a metal crown. Some of these are horned, others not. Furthermore they bear no direct association with wa- ter, but like the larger male and female figures are visual replicas of Idoma social categories. The mud shrine figures have a number of Benue Valley precedents, including those found among the Kutep (Rubin 1968), Afo (Leuzinger 1966), and Idoma- speaking Alago north of the Benue River. Both the Afo and the Alago have had ex- tensive historical contacts with the Idoma south of the river, including actual population movements during the 19th- century Fulani wars. It is often difficult to isolate which animal is being repre- sented from its anatomical features alone. Among the Afo, figures that may be nearly identical are described some- times as bush-cows and at other times as lions. 10 The same is true of anjenu shrine animals that, while spotted, are called agaba (lion). The point is that the images are metaphors of power, not literal rep- resentations. The salutation for an Idoma king is agabaidu (lion-cobra). Leopards are also clan symbols for a number of Idoma groups, and are pri- mary symbols of kingship as well. Thus a spotted lion is an aggrandizement of leopard power. Female images found inanjenu shrines may represent either alenyi (people-of- the-water) or echekwu (world-spirits) that emanate from termite hills or the atmo- sphere. Typically this is a figure of a woman, often holding a child in her lap or on her back. 11 This is not a recent genre of sculpture but simply an appropriation of an earlier form of fertil- ity figure found in central and northern Idoma. Fertility cults are widespread in the Benue region, and in Idoma itself at least one female figure genre, and possi- bly two, pre-dates the adoption of the an- jenu cult. The first of these is ekwotame (spirit- with-breasts), a lineage symbol. The example illustrated here is the oldest still in use in Idomaland (Fig. 7). 12 (An al- most identical piece by the same hand belonged to Sir Jacob Epstein and is now in a private collection in London.) It shares the same basic iconography of the later anjenu figures, though, regrettably, the latter are carved from soft wood and are highly vulnerable to attacks by white ants. Another difference is that modern anjenu figures are always painted, as in the whiteface mask tradition (Fig. 5).13 Despite the modernizing of female an- jenu figures by dressing them up in ear- rings and wrappers, even head-ties, they usually retain the 19th-century Idoma ritual hairstyle in the form of a sagittal crest, and frequently the body scarification patterns as well. Some an- jenu are conservatively dressed in waistbeads, the wrapper being a more recent adoption in the Benue region. All of them are interesting social docu- ments. The other prototype on which con- temporary carvers base their anjenu im- ages is anyanmole, a figure formerly used in the public disciplining of women. A late example of this can be drawn from the 1940s when anyanmole (literally, "women spoil the compound") came into special prominence (Fig. 10).14 The war years saw an emphasis on cash crops-rubber, palm produce, soya beans, and cotton-which the British needed for their own ends. This resulted in an economic boom in Idomaland, and a corresponding rise in the economic status of women, who were the main producers of these crops. Idoma women who had previously depended financially on their husbands now found the situation reversed. This new economic independence was rein- forced by the fact that soldiers returning from the war provided a plentiful supply of husbands for those who wished to 49</page><page sequence="4">remarry. In this new climate, women as- serted themselves in ways Idoma men found threatening to the status quo. The balance was restored in this battle of the sexes by the introduction of a dance called osobo (an older name for the Urhobo peoples of the Niger Delta), in which the anyanmole figure was borne aloft. Songs of social derision were hurled at the young women accused of unseemly behavior, while the aggres- sive, seductive aspects of their appearance were represented in the an- yanmole figure. 15 Male anjenu figures have no pre- colonial prototypes that I have been able to discover, and it is likely that they, along with the practice of painting sculp- ture, diffused into Idoma from the Ogoja-Cross River route. They invari- ably wear the European-style hat that es- tablished itself as a fashion at the coast (Fig. 6). Linguistic evidence places anjenu sol- idly in its Benue Valley context. From the Hausa aljanu, Yoruba (anjanun, alujanun), Igala (alijenu), and Idoma cognates were derived, all having their ultimate origin in the Arabic djinn, malevolent minor spirits who lurk on bush paths, in cook- ing pots, and in myriad other places. 16 In response to direct questioning, one el- derly follower of anjenu near Otukpo ex- plained: "Other lands have it. Igala has. Only Tivs don't have ... It's the Igala who came to show us the way."17 Other evidence, such as anjenu song texts, gives clues of an Igala connection, though the artifacts used in propitiating alijenu spirits do not appear to include either mud shrine sculpture or freestand- ing anthropomorphic figures such as those seen in Idoma shrines. 18 An Abakwariga version of the cult as practiced in Wukari testifies to the spread of similar beliefs eastward along the Benue (Rubin 1969:54). Here it is known by its Hausa name aljanu among the Abakwariga, and as jonkpa (ajon Abakpa, "spirits of the Abakwariga") among the Jukun. Rubin has reported aljanu as a healing and protective cult involving spirit possession and followed mainly by women-the essential characteristics of anjenu. But again there are no reports of a specific genre of wood sculpture as- sociated with the aljanu spirits. This as- pect of the cult seems to belong to the Idoma, and even more specifically to the Akweya subgroup of Akpa district, in which two well-known carvers, Ochai and Oba, were responsible for most of the figures seen in anjenu shrines of the district. Anjenu sculpture does exist in other districts, such as Okwoga, but once again is mainly the output of a sin- gle artist. In this respect, anjenu figures are de- ceptive because, as frequently happens in African art, the work of a single carver may be assumed wrongly to be a wide- spread genre and a group style. Ochai, whose work was first documented by Sieber in 1958, was a prolific carver whose reputation spread to several dis- tricts. Few details of his life are known, and he apparently died some time in the 1950s. Many of his figures still survive in shrines,19 although most are severely damaged by insects. Two commissioned figures probably carved by him were col- lected by Captain Beaver and donated to the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, in 1932 (Fig. 8). It is not possible to tell, given the ab- sence of documentation,whether these are anjenu or some other female figure genre, perhapsanyanmole. In either case, the faces are essentially those of Ochai's whiteface masks used by Idoma and Akweya men's regulatory societies. The crested coiffure and scarification pat- terns are seen in earlier Idoma figure sculpture, but the painted whiteface style is part of the southern component in Idoma art that probably diffused into the area from Ogoja during the 19th century along with certain masquerade societies. An intriguing question that needs to be asked is: Have sculptors been the un- conscious agents of transmission of the anjenu cult? In the five districts surveyed, there is a strong correlation between the presence of active woodcarvers and the incidence of anjenu shrines. While it is possible to have a shrine without carv- ings, there is the feeling among shrine owners that such shrines are less than maximally effective. Here the problem becomes very complex because "effec- tiveness" means not only the ability to appease the anjenu spirits but also the ability to create a ritual ambience that is aesthetically satisfying for the partici- pants. The presence of carved images and the singing of anjenu songs are not essential to anjenu sacrifice, but they honor the spirits more effectively than could a lone anjenu follower with her bot- tle of sacred water. They also create group solidarity among the cult follow- ers through a combination of aesthetic effects (sculpture and singing) and techniques of the body (trance states). This does not really answer the ques- tion posed earlier, for regardless of the efficacy of carved spirit images, the cor- 7. EKWOTAME FIGURE CARVED ca. 1890, PROTOTYPE FOR ANJENU FIGURES. RIGHT 8.

That is, the reasons for the occurrence of a heavy cult following in an area rich in woodcarving may be quite independent of each other. But if it is true, then it suggests a broader generalization for Idoma society as a whole: that the spread of both cults and masquerade societies is heavily depen- dent on the presence of local carvers to create the essential ritual artifacts. There is nothing new or startling in this idea, but it is often overlooked by an- thropologists dealing with cults and masking groups as institutions rather than as users of hard-to-acquire objects. Up to now, anjenu has been examined as a cult of the Benue, but the net can be cast more widely than this, from Hausa- land all the way to the coast. The Hausa bori cult is far more elaborate thananjenu, and much more widely followed. There is a very extensive pantheon of bori spirits, each asserting its possession of the spirit medium by causing a different pattern of behavior. Whereas bori spirits are incarnated kinesthetically through characteristic dance movements and cos- tumes, with a strong emphasis on per- formance, anjenu spirits are concretized as carved images in a shrine. The re- semblance lies in the fact that both are recognizable depictions, on the other side of the looking glass, of indigenous social categories.20 The anjenu mother and child, the male figure, the doctor, the information officer, and the policeman may be present alongside the purely symbolic lion, leopard, and white- bellied stork and the quasi- anthropomorphic horned heads used as bottle-stoppers.21 While these images are attempts at mimesis in the Idoma case, the bori spirits are social caricatures depicting a wide range of behavior- anger, envy, passion, sensuality, nobility, sickness, and so on (Onwuejeogwu 1969:288). The personal attributes of an- jenu spirits, even their identity, vary widely and are known only to the anjenu priest and followers of a particular shrine. Like bori, anjenu has two social aspects-healing and possession-and a predominantly female membership.22 As in other African healing cults domi- nated by women, the main concerns are with fertility and reproductive disorders, and the use of spirit possession as a form of therapy. The marginal position of Idoma women in relation to almost all forms of ritual life creates a situation analogous to that of bori, in which women, as a "muted group" (Ardener 1975:21-22) are able to find an alternative mode of articulation. 23 9. MAMMY WATA MASK USED FOR KWAGHIR PLAYS IN WESTERN TIVLAND, BUT PROBABLY MADE IN IKOT EK- PENE. 1977. Some anjenu followers know of bori, at least through hearsay, and still more have heard of Mammy Wata. Certain techniques, such as the use of a calabash upturned in water and beaten with a stick in order to summon the anjenu spirits, are said to have been learned from bori followers. The Hausa com- munity in Doma, an Idoma-speaking Alago town north of the Benue, is al- leged to be the source of this knowledge. Mammy Wata, a spirit said to dwell in the depths of the water and to appear from time to time, has a wide following among West African coastal peoples as well as in Zaire. 24 Recently, these beliefs have begun to diffuse into Idoma and to become mixed with ideas concerning an- jenu. 25 Like anjenu, Mammy Wata is par- ticularly attractive to women, though she also claims male disciples. And like anjenu, she comes to trouble people in dreams (Salmons 1977:10). In both cults, this results in trance states and other de- viant patterns of behavior among those who have been "seized" by the spirit(s). But anjenu lack completely the siren-like aspects of Mammy Wata. They are prop- itiated and followed not because they are admired but because, like bori spirits, they are powerful.26 Nor is the principal imagery associated with anjenu that ofMammy Wata. Though anjenu spirits are often female, they lack the long European hair and the snake en- twined about the neck and arms that are essential attributes of Mammy Wata. Yet, increasingly, Mammy Wata is becoming known in Idomaland, and among their eastern neighbors, the Tiv. Despite the 10. ANYANMOLE "WOMEN SPOIL THE COMPOUND" FIG- URE BY OKATI, A PROTOTYPE FOR ANJENU FIGURES. fact that the Tiv have no water spirit cult of their own, there is at least one instance of an Anang Ibibio carving of Mammy Wata having been acquired by a Tiv kwaghir group in Katsina Ala (Fig. 9). Though used in an entertainment mas- querade as Mammy Wata, it has been bor- rowed solely as an artifact, without ac- companying rituals or beliefs.27 Thus one finds Mammy Wata in one part of the Benue operating as a purely secular symbol, alongside actual beliefs in spirits such as anjenu, aljanu and alijenu, while in another part of the Benue, Mammy Wata is being incorporated into the exist- ing belief structure as a variant of anjenu spirits. Salmons reports that Mammy Wata has already diffused as far north as Ogoja and Ikom (1977:14), and it is very likely that as time passes there will be a greater fusion of Mammy Wata concepts with those of anjenu, as well as possible mod- ifications in anjenu imagery to include snakes and mermaid symbolism. This will simply be a continuation on the ongo- ing process of synthesis which has characterized the cult and its imagery from its beginnings, and which makes it an appropriate example to characterize the diversity of Idoma art as a whole. O Notes, page 91 51</page><page sequence="6">KASFIR, Notes, from page 51 1. Fieldwork in Idoma, begun initially in 1974, was carried out between August 1976 and July 1978 under the sponsorship of the Institute of African Studies, University of Ibadan, Ni- geria. Certain place names and names of informants have been omitted to protect the security of art objects. 2. Abakwariga is the name for pagan Hausa in the Middle Benue. The general Idoma term for Hausa is Abakpa. 3. An earlier generation of scholars (most notably Sir H. R. Palmer) assumed that Idoma culture had been "Jukunized" by its contact with the Kwararafa confederacy known to the Idoma as Api. There is an increasing body of evidence based on fieldwork by Arnold Rubin, J. B. Webster, R. G. Armstrong, and me that much of what has been called Jukun was actually pagan Hausa influence on both the Jukun and the Idoma. 4. The most important are the Akweya and Egede. The com- plex question "Who are the Idoma?" has been studied in de- tail by Erim O. Erim (1977). Ethnicity is in part subjective, and while the Idoma think of themselves as "people of Apa," this is strictly true for only part of the population, the others hav- ing been absorbed under this rubric during the period of col- onial administration. Both the historicity and the location of Apa are the subject of continuous debate. Suffice it to say here that, like Ile-Ife for the Yoruba, ApAi is a place larger than life, real but also invested with myth. 5. See for example Edwin Ardener's discussion of Bakweri liengu beliefs (1975). James Fernandez has made the same point concerning Fang concepts of space (1977). 6. Idoma women are primarily farmers rather than traders and thus are economically dependent on their husbands. They have few jural or political rights and are excluded from participation in the earth and ancestral cults as well as the all-male regulatory societies. Aside from informal age-sets formed in early childhood, their main social organization is the dance group. These groups, while important to women, do not offer ritual access to the supernatural. For this they must turn to anjenu. 7. R. G. Armstrong, personal communication, 1978. 8. Because the cult is so loosely structured, without formal recruitment or initiation rituals, it is difficult to arrive at membership statistics. While the counting of shrines gives a rough estimate, there may be several members of a family using the same shrine. In one village in Akpa district, there were over one hundred shrines in a total population of about one thousand. 9. The calabash contains, among other things, water and charcoal, the latter from certain species of trees considered the abodes of spirits. This cult emblem is borrowed from the Idoma ritual for propitiating a child's guardian spirit ekoceyi (eka oce eyi, "medicine which is placed on the head") (Abra- ham 1967:229) and is employed inanjenu possession rituals in which it is placed on the head of the adept. 10. Fieldwork visit to Afo country, 1974. 11. Because the child on the lap is often carved separately, most museum examples have lost this important addition. 12. The figure was said to have been acquired in the Tiv- Idoma borderland by the grandfather of the present owner, in return for which he paid one slave, one dane gun and a brass armlet. It bears Tiv scarification patterns and may derive from the Tiv ancestral figures known as ihambe, found outside the huts of wives taken in exchange marriage (Downes 1971:82). 13. There are no visible traces of paint on the ekwotame figure in situ, though it has never undergone scientific analysis. Be- fore making its rare public appearances it is oiled and then dressed in waistbeads and earrings. The pigment used for Idoma whiteface masks and figures is made from ground shells or from kaolin. As elsewhere in Nigeria, commercial oil paints have begun to be used on new sculpture and (with unfortunate results) in refurbishing old pieces. 14. A.P Anyebe, personal communication, 1979. 15. A.P Anyebe, personal communication, 1979. 16. Abraham's Yoruba dictionary (1958:52) gives anjanun as "evil spirits" while Greenberg (1946:28) mentions the Arabic-derived aljan (plural aljanu) as a synonym for the Hausa iska (plural iskoki) meaning "spirit." One of Boston's Igala informants said that alijenu "appear like little people" (J. Boston, personal communication, 1981).Dike was told that alijenu were malevolent female spirits (1976:5/4). 17. Interview of Ada of Upu by Ichakpa Amali, May 23, 1978. The Igala are thought to be very knowledgeable in medicine, as are the Hausa. Anjenu spirits are more closely associated with "medicine" (eci) than with spirits from the world of the dead (ekwu), as they are instrumental in healing and fertility. 18. This statement may well prove to be incorrect. Unfortu- nately, most field research on Igala sculpture is still unpub- lished. Chik6 Dik6 described an alijenu gourd covered with cowries (1976:5/8-10), but mentioned no carved sculpture. On the other hand, John Picton once photographed a carved female figure in a shrine that was identified as alijenu (Van de Velde-Caremans 1976:139). It is also possible that the so-called box or mirror-frame figures have sometimes functioned as alijenu. The concept itself is certainly widespread in the con- fluence area, and was reported by Frobenius (1913:552passim) early in this century. In Okpella, Jean Borgatti has reported masquerades with this designation, personifying forest spirits (personal communication, 1979). The elaborate zoomorphic alijenu calabash stopper collected by Sieber in the northern Nsukka village of Ete near the Igala borderland (1961:fig. 17), while frequently cited, seems not to have been reported elsewhere,and may be a local variant. Another of these, reported by Dik6 (1976:5/7), consists of three cloth fig- ures with mask-like faces, called ajenu. 19. Two European dealers made an illegal collecting trip to Idoma in1972, using Professor Sieber's catalogue Sculpture of Northern Nigeria (1961) as a field guide. Fortunately many of Ochai's best pieces eluded them, but the threat of illegal col- lecting creates a serious ethical problem for scholars wishing to publish such material. 20. Terence Booth has argued that the impersonation of bori spirits represents a dissolution and restructuring of Hausa social categories, due partly to the fact that bori dancers are men and women at the margins of Hausa society (1978:46). 21. These horned heads, found mainly in Okwoga, vaguely resemble Igbo ikenga and Igala okega, though I have not been able to trace any direct connection. 22. I am speaking here of bori in its rural version. As an urban cult, it attracts marginal men-homosexuals and non-Hausa ethnic minorities-as well as women. 23. A second essay, now in preparation, considers in detail the cult as it relates to Idoma women. 24. She surfaces as far east as Shaba Province in Zaire as mamba muntu (Fabian 1978). 25. I could find no anjenu follower who claimed to have seen Mammy Wata, but a number were familiar with the concept and some even claimed Mammy Wata was synonymous with anjenu. Others say that while the former "lives only in the water," the latter "dwell both in water and in the bush." The location of nature spirit abodes obviously depends upon the topography of a region. Among the Bakweri of Mount Came- roun, coastal liengu water spirits have been translated into bush spirits by their montane forest environment, yet still re-</page><page sequence="7">tain their marine iconography (Ardener 1975:8). The Idoma insistence that anjenu inhabit both water and bush is partly a reflection of Idoma topography, in which some people are riverine but others not, but more importantly a reflection of the fact that the Benue represents a southern margin of djinn influence while also the northern boundary of coastal and Cross River water spirits. 26. According to Jill Salmons, Mammy Wata in the Cross River is thought to confer good luck, wealth, and beauty among her followers but at the expense of fertility (1977:8). This is quite contrary to anjenu beliefs, in which fertility is the major re- ward for the propitiation of the spirits. 27. From Katsina Ala, the mask traveled to a small hamlet in northwest Tivland near the Idoma border. Here I found it being copied by a Tiv carver in 1978. Jill Salmons has iden- tified the mask as originating in Ikot Ekpene (personal com- munication, 1978). Bibliography Abraham, Roy Clive. 1967. The Idoma Language.
