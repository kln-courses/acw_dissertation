<plain_text><page sequence="1">I (a) Political and Administrative History 1 PERCEPTIONS OF POWER: AN ANALYSIS OF THE PARYAYA SUKTA (8.10) OF THE ATHARVA VEDA KUMKUM ROY* I 1.1 The need to define the nature of power and power-based relationships is commonly experienced in societies where existing definitions are challenged and/or new ones emerge. In such situations, attempts are often made to reiterate existing definitions of power or to arrive at new definitions. In either case, the definitions which are evolved or regarded as acceptable constitute a means of justifying claims to power and the use of power as a means of ordering social relationships. It is within this context that we propose to analyse a specific definition of power which is found in the paryaya sukta (8.10) of the Atharva Veda.1 1.2 The theme of the sukta in question, which consists of six sections, and thirty- three smaller divisions, is the exaltation of the viraj, conceived of as feminine personification of power. It is mainly in prose and does not seem to have been used in the ritual context. Traditionally, its composition is ascribed to an atharvacarya. As this is neither a proper name, nor a gotra- based name, it is likely that the author(s) was (were) anonymous. In other words, if one attempts to locate the sukta within the vast corpus of later vedic literature, one may suggest that its position is somewhat marginal in the sense that it was * Lecturer in History, Satyawati Co-educational College, Ashok Vihar III, Delhi.</page><page sequence="2">Kumkum Roy : Perceptions of Power probably not related to the dominant ritualistic tradition. Viewed from this perspective, the concept of power enunciated in the sukta assumes a certain unique significance, as it permits us to explore a definition of power which was different from that expounded within the dominant brahmanical tradition, and the problems encountered in handling it. II 2.1 The description of the viraj commences with an emphasis on her all pervasiveness (AV 8.10.1.1) which evokes fear in everything else.2 This fear appears to be resolved through specifying and consequently delimiting the nature of the pervasiveness of the viraj at a number of levels, and through working out the relationship between the viraj and a range of categories. 2.2 The first aspect of viraj which is highlighted relates to her identification with ritual dimensions of agni, fire. This is conceived of as a "descent" into various forms of fire, such as the garhapatya, ahavaniya, and dakshinagni (AV 8.10.1.2,4,6), central to the sacrifice.3 Knowledge of this is, moreover, perceived as a means of enabling a man to participate in the sacrificial cult. For instance, a man who was aware of the significance of the descent into the garhapatya, was thought to become a grihamedhin and a grihapati (AV 8. 10.1. 3). 4 Thus, the wra/'was viewed as intrinsic to but not distinct from the sacrifice. Besides, while the viraj was regarded as implicitly endowing the sacrificial fires with an element of power, this was then transferred to the human situation, where ritual power was ascribed to the "knower" as opposed to the ignorant. The notion of all-pervasive power associated with the viraj was thus channellised into a definition of power in terms of significant ritual categories. Further, in the human context, this power was attributed not to the viraj but to those who controlled such categories, and the activities associated with them, including the sacrifice. In other words, the diffuse, amorphous powers attributed to the viraj were conceived of as flowing from her to others. These "others" were not defined as the totality of the population, but as a limited category. 2.3 The notion of the descent of the viraj into specific institutions, and her consequent absorption in them, followed by the transfer of power to the knower, outlined above, is reiterated in the connection between the viraj, and the sabha, samiti and the amantrana (A V 8.10.1. 8, 10, 12). While the sabha and samiti are fairly well-known Vedic assemblies, the amantrana probably signified an invitation (to such assemblies?). Once again, the "knower" is assured of becoming a sabhya, samitya, and an amantraniya, i.e. a man worthy of participating in the activities associated with these institutions. III 3.1 A second theme which is explored, and which is, in a sense, a variation of the first, defines the viráj as approaching certain categories of beings. She is then 57</page><page sequence="3">Proceedings , IHC : 52nd Session , 1991-92 destroyed by them, but re-emerges. However, the benefits of her re- appearance accrue to those who destroy her rather than to vi raj herself. For instance, she is conceived of as approaching the trees, who kill her: she revives in the course of a year, hence, trees which are cut grow within a similar span of time ( AV 8. 10.3.1, 2). 5 In an identical fashion, she was thought to approach the pitris (ibid. 8.10.3.3), devas (ibid. 8.10.3.5), and manushyas (ibid. 8.10.3.7), who were conceived of as killing her. The only difference is in the time of her envisaged resurrection, which varies from a month in the case of the pitris, to a fortnight in the case of the devas, and a day in the case of human beings, this being taken to coincide with the recommended periodicity for the offerings to be made to each category.6 IV 4.1 Inspite of broad similarities, certain differences are evident in the two attempts to link the power of the viraj to the human social order, defined so as to encompass prevalent notions of the entire universe. While the first theme explores how the power of the viraj may be mediated through institutions such as the sacrifice and assemblies, the second theme focuses on a more direct relationship between the viraj, conceived of as an empowering agent, and specific categories of what were regarded as sentient beings. These included animate categories such as the vanaspatis and manushyas , or categories conceptualised in anthropomorphic terms (e.g., the pitris and the devas). Each of these categories was conceived of as active agents in the relationship with the viraj. They were, moreover, viewed as destroying her and appropriating her powers. The powers which were thought to be transferred included those of resurgence and sustenance, basic to continued existence. 4.2 The relationship between the viraj and categories conceived of in anthropomorphic or animate terms was explored further through the concept of the viraj as a cow (AV, 8.10.4.5). In this context, the viraj is regarded as a cow who approaches various categories, and is invoked by them. This was thought to lead to the production of a vatsa or calf, often a legendary or mythical figure, regarded as her offspring, to the appearance of a patra or vessel made of a different substance in each case, and to the milking of certain qualities from the viraj, knowledge of which is considered as empowering, enabling the knower to become a source of sustenance.7 4.3 The categories associated with this particular concept were varied) see Table-I for details), including asuras, pitris, manushyas, saptarishis, devas,8 gandharvas and apsaras, itara jana (other people?), and sarpas. What is interesting about this list is its looseness - there is no discernible hierarchy amongst the categories, with the asuras placed first, and the devas ranked fifth, with the manushyas in between. Alternatively, if there is an order, it is clearly very different from that commonly found in the brahmanical tradition, as for instance in the pariplava cycle of the ashvamedha, where almost all the categories mentioned above are referred to. What is also noteworthy is that 58</page><page sequence="4">Kumkum Roy : Perceptions of Power the relationship envisaged between the vi raj and each of the these categories is uniform. In each instance, the vi 'raj is conceived of as approaching the category in question, being invoked by them, producing a son and obtaining a vessel. She is then milked, this "milk" in turn producing the source of sustenance for the category in question. V 5.1 The conceptualisation of the viraj as a cow who produces calves and is milked, thus elaborated, was located mid-way between the two possibilities outlined earlier. While the common element of transferring the power of the vi ráj to others was reworked and elaborated, two media were envisaged in this case, consisting of the calf, who was directly empowered, and the milk, conceived of as an instrument for providing sustenance to the specific category. These media were related to, but not identified with the viraj. What is more, both were related, to the procreative or generative powers of the viraj /cow. Thus, the power of the cow was not conceived of as being hers to exercise in her own right, but was thought to be transferred to her sons and those who milked her. Nevertheless, this did not involve killing the cow (the golden goose). 5.2 The power attributed to the cow, which was thus appropriated, was regarded as constituting the essence of the categories in question. This is underscored by the use of identical or related terms to "call" the viraj and describe her milk. For instance, the asuras were thought to have invoked her as maya and to have obtained maya as her milk, whereas manushyas, who were supposed to have invoked her as ira or food, were regarded as obtaining krishi and sasya (agriculture and grain) as her milk. In each case, the "milk" was regarded ass intrinsic to the existence or nature of that particular category, and was thought to define it. This "milk" moreover, was by definition available to all those who were regarded as members of that particular category. In other words, the notion of power embodied in the idea of appropriating the milk of the viraj was probably accessible to all those who belonged to a specific category. 5.3 At another level, however, certain named personages were conceived of as more powerful or playing a more significant role in society than other. These included vatsas or "calves", and milkers. The status of the two categories was by no means identical. A comparison of the proper names occurring in each category indicates that the former included well-known mythical- or legendary figures such as Yama, Manu Vaivasvata, Soma, Indra, Kuvēra, and Taksaka, most of whom were regarded as rajas of their respective groups in the context of the pariplava cycle of the ashvamedha. The list of milkers, on the other hand, contains the names of relatively unknown personages such as Antaka Martavya, and Rajatanabhi Kaberaka. Even where the names or relatively well-known figures are included, as, for example, in the case of Savitri, the milker of the devas, they are less important than those regarded as calves, Indra in this context. This difference may be explained in terms of the general thrust ot the brahmanical tradition, which accorded recognition to those who 59</page><page sequence="5">Proceedings , I HC : 52nd Session , 1991-92 concentrated power in their own hands, typified by those described as vatsas in the present context. As opposed to this, those who shared power with their community were relatively marginalised. 5.4 Turning to the patras or vessel, this seems to have been envisaged as a symbolic receptacle or adhara for the milk which was thought to be transferred from the vira] to the community. While the symbolism is fairly apparent in some cases, as for instance in the notion that the prithvi or earth is a patra for krishi and sasya, it is less easy to analyse in other cases.9 VI 6.1 The definitions of the attributes and the significance of the viraj, as incorporated within the Atharva Veda , were thus complex. As we have seen, efforts were made to relate the viraj to the ritual and social context, defined in the widest possible terms. What is also significant is that no one single possibility was imposed. Instead, a variety of possible relationships were explored. These point both to the importance of the notion of vairajya and the problems of incorporating it within the brahmanical tradition. In a sense, both these aspects were interrelated. 6.2 The common strand which runs through the three definitions of the viraj outlined above is a notion of power which is benevolent, associated with notions of sustenance, and transferable. While the attribute of benevolence and sustenance was not challenged in any of the definitions, the notion of transference was reworked at two levels. 6.3 In the first place, the mechanisms of the transfer were the subject of speculation. Was this transfer automatic, owing to the very fact that the viraj was pervasive, through a violent appropriation of her qualities, or through the appropriation of the manifestation of her power, typified by the calf and the milk? The acceptance or rejection of any one of these mechanisms would have had different social implications. In the first instance, power would have theoretically been accessible to virtually anyone, although this was, in effect, limited to those who had access to the sacrificial cult or assemblies, as noted earlier. Acceptance of violence as a mechanism for appropriating power would have implied a recognition of the importance of coercion in determining the nature of social relations. Identifying oneself or one's leader as the calf of the viraj would reinforce claims to divinity, and would have underscored the distinction between the leader and led. 6.4 Secondly, and related to the above, it was clearly necessary to specify the person or persons who acquired the power thus transferred. As we have seen, these included the male knower, and the community as a whole. Here, once again, there is a distinction drawn between the former, an individual man who was thought to appropriate power himself, and the larger community, whose essential attributes and very existence were thought to rest on the viraj. 60</page><page sequence="6">Kumkum Roy : Perceptions of Power VII 7.1 The exisfence of a plurality of definitions of the viraj and her relationship to what may broadly be termed as society, points to tensions and conflicts in defining power-based relations in the later Vedic context. The viraj was associated with the benevolent sharing of power. This was perhaps not problematic in a situation where social stratification was relatively undeveloped. However, in a situation where economic, political and ritual differences were becoming sharper, and were being accorded recognition, the universalista definition of power, associated with the viraj, possibly the product of different, less inegalitarian social circumstances, posed a threat. As we know, it was not, and probably could not be negated outright, possibly owing to the traditional prestige accorded to it. Hence, it was reworked, and the attributes associated with it were appropriated and assimilated to a changing social situation. This led to attempts to conceive of the power of the viraj as transferable, resulting in a conceptual shift from the perception of the viraj as a subject to that of the viraj as an object. In this context, the fact that the viraj was perceived of as feminine, both linguistically and symbolically, in the form of a cow, indicates that the redefinition of power which was attempted was stratified along gender lines. This is reflected in the notion of controlling the powers of nurturing and sustenance associated with women, typified in the powers attributed to the calf and milk. 7.2 The position accorded to the viraj and the related notion of vairajya was by no means central within the later vedic tradition in particular and the brahmanical tradition in general. Nevertheless, the fact that references to the notion occur occasionally would suggest that at least some of those who subscribed to the brahmanical tradition thought it important enough to attempt to grapple with it and to bring it into harmony with other definitions of power. The persistence of such attempts indicates that resistance to the structuring of social relations within any single framework was probably continuous. NOTES AND REFERENCES: 1 .

The relationship between the viraj and the devas is also explored along more or less similar lines in AV, 8.10.2, where they hail her as urja, svadha, sunrta, and iravati. In this context too, Indra was regarded as her vatsa, and the attributes milked out from her included the osadhis or plants, vyacas or expansion, apah or waters, and th e yajna or sacrifice. 9.
