<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ice: A Journey to Antarctica. Stephen J. Pyne. London: Arlington Books, 1987. 428pp. 16 χ 24cm. £12.95. ISBN 0 85140 709 9. Antarctica has cast its spell over the author, an American historian. He skates breathlessly across the coldest continent, dropping names and nomenclature like a paper chase. Five glacial chapters on berg-, pack-, shelf-, glacier- and sheet-ice, are interspersed with historical reviews of exploration, literature and art, earth science and geopolitics, but no themes are developed in depth. A bibliographic essay and notes are included. The historical chapters are presented soberly, though understandably, with a slight American bias. The author, however, is captivated by the aesthetics of ice, occasionally retreating into metaphor (nunataks become 'navigational beacons' for glaciers, p. 235) and anthropomorphism (glaciers are 'almost ingenuous1, p. 214). Glacial jargon is obsessively listed, but land- and ice-forms are never fully explained, an obvious frustration for the uninitiated. Even a few more well-chosen illustrations could have resolved this problem. The 14 familiar or indifferent black and white photographs, and 9 maps and diagrams, are of nominal value only. The serious student of Antarctica will gain little if anything from this text. It is, however, a 'good read' (suitable for a holiday, for instance) and might inspire the historically illiterate, but glacially knowledgeable sixth form geography student to delve more deeply into this crucially important continent.
