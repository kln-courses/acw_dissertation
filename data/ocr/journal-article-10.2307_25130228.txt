<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARDS ABSOLUTE TIME: GUANO ARCHAEOLOGY George Kubler THE Peruvian records indicate that the guano islands (Fig. 14) yielded, between 1826 and 1875, several thousand artifacts of pre-Conquest origin. These are probably only a fraction of the archaeological material actually discovered during the commercial destruction of guano caps. Most of it has been lost; several hundred specimens in the museums of Europe and America still retain some record of their origin; and a small group of pieces, with which this paper is principally concerned, are known to have been discovered under stratified and depth-recorded conditions. Such evidence is not ideal for study today, 70 years after the complete destruction of the im mense and ancient guano deposits of the Chin cha, Macabi, and Guafiape island groups. Yet the accounts of a few independent observers and old photographs of the guano stratification (Fig. 15) record information that, when as sembled, suggests the rough outlines of an absolute time-scale for Peruvian prehistory.

Peruvian Guano Islands. (After Murphy, 1936.) 29</page><page sequence="2">30 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 The biological history of the Peruvian guano islands, exhaustively studied by Professor G. E. Hutchinson in a monograph1 from which this paper is an off-shoot, supports the attempt to establish an absolute time-scale for the arti facts.2 Photographs taken in 1860 on North and Central Chincha Islands, and now owned by the American Museum of Natural History, show the stratification of the guano stacks re maining at that time.3 The photographs reveal both wide and fine stratifications of such re markable regularity (Fig. 15) as to dispose of the contention that the lower layers of the guano were subject to great mechanical com Fig. 15. View of Guano Stack on Central Chincha Is. about 1860. (Courtesy American Museum of Natural History.) 1 Forthcoming in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History (G. E. Hutchinson, 1948). See the abstract by Professor Hutchinson of the relevant portions of this paper, proffered here as Appendix B. 2 The possibility has occurred to various writers, but it has never beeri developed because of the lack of a suitable biological history of the islands. Manuel Gonzalez de la Rosa took the trouble, between 1869 and 1872, to send a questionnaire on archaeology to the governors of the vari ous islands. His paper (Gonzalez de la Rosa, 1908), however, expressed skepticism that valid findings on chronology could be derived from the guano islands. The paper by Luis Gamarra Dulanto (1942) is similarly inconclusive. Biological writers, on the other hand, such as Murphy (1936, p. 292), have been deterred from drawing reasonable conclusions by their estimates of immense antiquity, ir regular deposition, and mechanical compression of the lower layers of the guano caps. The views are discussed at length by G. E. Hutchinson in his forthcoming monograph. 3 Tschudi (1866-69, Vol. 5, pp. 374-5) remarks that in 1840, when he first visited the Chincha Islands, few ships were in evidence, and the birds were still to be numbered by the millions. In October, 1858, however, the ships and the workers were so numerous that no birds were to be seen. Only the great central stacks were left on the islands. pressions and deformations.4 The interpretation of the strata has been made by Professor Hutchinson: he concludes that the entire depo sition, 47.4 m. thick on Central Chincha, can not have taken more than three or four thou sand years, nor can it have taken less than six centuries. The short period is out of the ques tion for oceanic and biological reasons, for if deposition began in the thirteenth century, other changes would be known. Without con sidering the archaeological findings, and only on the basis of the fine stratifications evident in the photographs, Professor Hutchinson attributes the beginning of the large deposits, on the main Peruvian guano islands, to the first or second millennium B.C. Between these theoretical limits, the archaeological record suggests a date for the initiation of the deposits that is roughly intermediate. The archaeological record, how ever, does not depend upon biological or climatological evidence. It has been worked out independently of other findings, and its "fit" with Professor Hutchinson's argument is not dependent upon any part of that argument, but only upon the depth relations among well docu mented objects. Such objects are few. To be useful, they must 4 Murphy, 1936, Vol. 1, p. 289. Professor Hutchinson provides the following comment to this passage, "An even more impressive piece of evidence of a general horizonal stratification of great regularity is to be obtained from the photographs of the North Island deposit in 1853, published in the Boletin de la Compania Administradora del Guano, Vol. 11, pp. 472 and 483,1926, illustrating reprints of papers of Raimondi.

Formerly in Hamburg, Johanneum Naturhistorisches Museum, present location unknown. Clearly only the Chincha Islands have yielded depth-recorded artifacts in numbers that permit discussion. But it will be seen that the objects and the depths recorded from the other, more northerly island groups, although few in number, are not inconsistent with the argument that can be developed from Chincha Islands material. Certain artifacts from the Chincha Islands are closely related to industries and styles al ready known from the archaeology of the Peruvian mainland. Some comment on these connections and absences of connection, will be needed to prepare for the discussion of depth relations among the objects. 1. The Bollaert armorial slab (Fig. 16) is of colonial manufacture. The cartouche working of the outline of the shield is of North Italian/ origin, in the early part of the sixteenth cen tury.6 The shape itself was widely diffused throughout Europe and America before 1575. The inscription yields no further clues, for it is barely legible. It is carved in an approximation to Gothic letter that is of little use in dating, for this letter was current in Spain at least until the decade of the 1560's.6 The quarterings, like those of many Spanish-American grants of arms, contain topographic allusions. The upper right quadrant shows a long-billed bird, prob ably a pelican. The lower right quadrant dis plays waves and three islands, of which the central one bears a horseshoe-shaped nest, characteristic of the guanay nests of the Peru vian guano islands (cf. Fig. 29). These bearings can refer only to the Chincha Islands, which are three in number and have long been populated by large colonies of pelicans. Since the arms refer to the islands, they probably mark the ownership under which the early colonial exploitation of guano was con 6 Albert Van de Put, Late Keeper of the Victoria and Albert Museum and authority on Spanish heraldry, has suggested (in Utt., Feb. 18,1946) a date "about 1575-1600." Inquiries addressed to Peru yielded a theory to the effect that the stone was perhaps a funeral monument left upon the islands by a Flemish pirate in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. (Communicated by Jorge Zevallos, Chief of the Secci6n Historia at the Archivo Nacional in Lima, in Utt., Nov. 9, 1944). Of significance is only the in dependent agreement concordant with the writer's view, upon a possible late sixteenth-century dating. 8 Gothic letter was used in the inscriptions on the founda tion stone of the Escorial in 1563.

Because inhabited islands were always Crown property, the arms cannot have been granted to an individual.7 They can have signi fied only Crown ownership, under a specific corregimiento, or government with its adminis trative center on the mainland. This administrative center was surely the port on Paracas Bay, variously known as Sangallan and, later, Pisco (Fig. 25). The his tory of this settlement is relevant. Cieza de Leon, writing before 1550, spoke of Sangallan as a port,8 and described the nearby Chincha Islands, without being aware of their guano de posits. In 1572, Viceroy Toledo recommended to the Council of the Indies that a town be founded in Pisco Valley; by 1576, shipping was received at Puerto de Pisco; and in 1587 the harbor settlement was visited by English pirates.9 Early in the seventeenth century, the town possessed churches (Franciscan Recol lects, founded 1602; San Juan de Dios, founded 1634); in 1640, the name was changed to San Clemente de Mancera; and in 1687, the city was wrecked by earthquakes and tidal waves. Pisco was moved two miles inland to its present site in 1688.10 The style of the arms and of their carving suggests the period between 1575 and 1600. If the association with Pisco harbor is valid, they are probably the arms (otherwise unknown) of the settlement founded by order of Viceroy Toledo, ca. 1572, and destroyed in 1687.11 For working purposes, a date 1575-1600 is in agree ment with the style of the arms and their carv ing, as well as with the history of settlement on Paracas Bay. Within the span 1575-1600, the earlier years agree best with the history of settlement at Pisco and with the energetic government of Viceroy Toledo. 7 Individuals were not granted land by the Crown, but only the labor of Indians resident upon specified lands. See Zavala (1935) for a treatment of the entire question. 8 Cieza de Le6n, 1864, p. 27. A Spanish town named Sangallan existed as early as 1535, 7 leagues up the river from the sea.

Surely such arms were granted, ca. 1572; renewed in 1640; and perhaps granted again in 1688. 2. The Salem staff, 27 inches long, bears a rudely carved head at the thick end (Fig. 17). The stick is too light for a club (1J inches maximum diameter) and too short for a cane or digging stick. The form is rather that of a baton of command, such as the one carried by the Inca master of the roads, as portrayed by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, ca. 1613.12 The head carved on the handle is rude and direct, worked in a manner that seeks to suggest natural form by rounded passages. The writer can find nothkig in pre-Conquest Peruvian wood carv ing that resembles this long-headed, modeled version of human shape. Colonial, rather than pre-Conquest, work is likely. 3. The helmeted, nude wooden figure, repro duced by T. J. Hutchinson, is known only by this wood engraving (Fig. 18). No dimensions are given, but the piece is evidently the head of a staff and therefore probably between 5 and 10 inches high. The sex, clearly female, is at vari ance with the masculine gear of helmet and large earplugs. The carving of the body forms is abrupt and schematic, although not without anatomical accuracy in the rounded flesh sur faces. The sharply indented outlines of the figure and the squat body proportions recall Inca sculpture distantly, such as the sodalite figurines13 from Pikillajta in Cuzco Valley, or the large diorite head found 8 meters beneath the present level of the Jesuit Church in Cuzco.14 Another suggestion of late (i.e., fifteenth cen tury) date is the elongated, concave-flaring form of the cup the figure holds between her hands. Such cups in metal are familiar from north coast sites, in Inca and immediately pre Inca associations.15 On the whole, the style of the figure cannot be assimilated either to the coastal styles of consummate naturalism, such as Mochica wood16 and pottery, or the geo metrizing styles of Tiahuanacoid and "Middle 12 Guaman Poma de Ayala, 1936, Fol. 356. Guaman's colonial officials all carry long, slender staffs, or thick, knobby clubs. 13 Such sodalite figurines, known from the central coast of Peru, are made of material quarried in Boliva. (See Ahlfield and Wagner, 1931, and Valcarcel, 1933, pp. 21-48.) Valcarcel (1933, pp. 28, 33) mentions sodalite figurines like those of Pikillajta from lea and Nazca valleys as well as from Paracas Peninsula. 14 See Anonymous, 1933, PL XVII, 499, and pp. 81-2. 15 Baessler, 1906, PI. 20, Fig. 320; Hamy, 1897, PL LIV, 154r-7 (Anc6n). 16 Mochica staffs are figured by Strong, 1947, pp. 466, 478, 481. Cf. also Squier, 1871-72, p. 54, Figs. 11-13,</page><page sequence="7">kubler] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 35 period" associations. It seems to relate most closely to the wood carvings of a late, pre-Inca period, such as those from Marquez, at the mouth of the Chillon Valley (Dept. Lima). Among the staffs figured by Baessler, one (Fig. 187) shows the legs carved and crossed in a manner closely similar to that of our Figure 18.17 Thus a date in the fourteenth, or in the fif teenth, century seems reasonable. 4. The ten silver fishes collected by Squier are available for study at the American Mu seum of Natural History (Fig. 19). It is possible that these objects, each with a perforation near the mouth, were originally sewn to a cloth as ornaments. Several show more elaborate tool ing. These differences might suggest separate groups were it not that the objects are reliably attested as having been found together. In common, however, their style may be related to that of a number of metal objects of late pre Inca period, reported from the coast and catalogued by Baessler.18 5. The wooden torso with head, figured by Hutchinson, shows a rude, geometric style (Fig. 20) that may be compared to the abstract representations of the Tiahuanacoid period on the coast. The size is unknown. The face is treated as half an ellipse. It contains lozenge shaped eyes and a box mouth with five teeth. The flat plane of the face is surmounted by a squarish hat with peaks at the corners. The hat is of a form known first in the Tiahuanacoid period, as in the headdresses figured by Baessler and Bennett.19 The lozenge eyes and box mouth with five teeth compare closely with a figure of unknown provenience illustrated by Seler.20 6. Five objects are shown by Hutchinson in the find reported at 62 feet beneath the guano on the Chincha Islands (Fig. 21). Specimen A 1.15 is evidently a pottery vessel, representing a seated human with a rope around 17 Baessler, 1902-03, Vol. 1, PL 33. The staff, 161 cm. long, has a cross-legged figure 15 cm. high on the handle. Cf. also Schmidt, 1929, p. 413. 18 Baessler, 1906, Nos. 237, 298, 460, 461. Baessler's materials in general are of a style that may be identified as "Late," in the sense that they are either Incaic or im mediately pre-Incaic. The Squier fishes may also be com pared to the Late Chimu, pressed blackware representa tions on pottery of the north coast, e.g., Baessler, 1902-03, Vol. 2, PL 72, Figs. 262-3. 19 Baessler, 1902-03, Vol. 4, Fig. 408 (featherwork); Bennett, 1946a, PL 43 (Coll. John Wise, hat in velvet tech nique). 20 Seler, 1893, PL 13, Fig. 5 (Macedo Coll.). his neck. The form is common in Mochica pottery of the north coast. The wood engraving suggests the white paint on a red ground that is characteristic of many Mochica wares. The human figure represents a prisoner, as may be inferred from other specimens in which the hands are roped together behind the figure's back.21 Specimen A 1.16 represents a dog vessel. Un fortunately, its color cannot be determined. Its most striking singularity is the combination of a flaring neck vent with carrying loop. This as sembly is lacking in standard Mochica wares, where the flaring neck never appears with a carrying loop, to the writer's knowledge. Such an assembly does appear repeatedly in pre Mochica, north coast wares, such as Salinar;22 it disappears from standard Mochica wares of all classes; and it reappears in Late Chimu vessels.23 The modeled form of the dog, on the other hand, strongly recalls Mochica rather than Chimu techniques of detailed and descrip tive sculpture.24 Hence, A 1.16 offers a choice: if it can be proved that its period is Late Chimu, then a large part of the argument of this essay collapses, for the argument is based upon an assumption that the five pieces in Figure 21 are all contemporaneous within two or three gen erations. But the modeling is far closer to Mochica than to Chimu, and the neck-and-loop assembly is known in pre-Mochica Salinar style.25 These affinities will allow a Mochica or pre-Mochica identification for item A 1.16 until better evidence for the Chimu dating is dis covered. Specimen A 1.17 is evidently a clay fragment of unknown use and style. Possibly an egg or a fruit shape is intended. The light color and precise shape again suggest Mochica origin. Specimen A 1.18 is a wooden staff, slotted at the handle and bearing a crouching animal or human figure. It is almost the exact analogue of one figured by Baessler as coming from Chan 21 As in Schmidt (1929, p. 135), from Chimbote, or in the specimen in the Museum of the American Indian (5/ 1746), 0.243 m. high, from Chimbote. Cf. Tello, 1938, p. 16. 22 Tello, 1938, Fig. 2 and p. 65; Larco Hoyle, 1944, p. 12. 23 As on the blackware specimen from Lambayeque, figured by Bennett (1946a, PL 49, d), or in the pressed black ware specimen from Chiclayo figured by Schmidt, 1929, p. 212 (23 cm. high). 24 Cf. Tello, 1938, p. 171. 25 It is absent from the Cupisnique wares discovered and published by Larco Hoyle (1941). But the dog vessel may belong to a style that is still undiscovered on the mainland.</page><page sequence="8">36 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 cay.26 In the absence of any systematic knowl edge about Peruvian wood carving, it is im possible to assign this piece or its analogues to a well-defined period. No compelling arguments force an identification either as Mochica or post-Mochica. The Chancay provenience of the piece figured by Baessler cannot be taken as a telling argument against Mochica style, for Mochica specimens have long been known from the south coast of Peru,27 although never properly evaluated as evidence for Mochica distribution. Specimen A 1.19 is described as a "stone idol." It is clearly a thin plate, shaped as an ithyphallic, possibly hermaphrodite, human. The head is marred by flaking, so that little can be observed of its style, although the half ellipse of the face is clearly and strongly de fined. Nothing like it in mainland archaeology is known to the writer. The unworked, down ward tapering base suggests use as an upright slab, inserted into the ground. The depth-recorded objects from other island groups than the Chinchas are not numerous enough to warrant detailed discussion. The one group of finds, however, from the Macabi Islands,28 under 60 English feet of guano, is closely enough related to mainland archaeology to merit treatment (Fig. 24). All specimens, of which illustrations were made, are of wood. Numbers 1 and 3 are very closely related to the wooden figures found by Hutchinson in Cafiete Valley (Fig. 43) .29 Number 1 is a stand ing, nude male prisoner, as in the Cafiete Valley specimen. Number 3 is a seated figure, badly worn and almost identical with its Cafiete Valley analogue. Number 2, a seated, nude wooden prisoner, is nearly a replica of the Chincha Island Mochica pottery vessel repre senting such a prisoner (Fig. 21). Now all three Macabi specimens from Hamburg closely re semble the wood carvings in the British Museum (Figs. 26, 28) cataloged as coming 26 Baessler, 1902-03, Vol. 1, PL 33, Fig. 188. The figure is 8.5 cm. high, on a staff of 68 cm. over-all length. 27 Mochica artifacts from Anc6n are fairly numerous at the Museum of the American Indian: Nos. 5/1732, 8/4538, 14/4540, 14/4544, 14/7671, 15/1449; from near Lima, 7/2721, 7/2724, 7/2735, 7/2740; lea, 14/4570. Peabody Museum, Harvard, has a Mochica specimen from Pisco or lea (75572, Farrabee collection, 1909). For Cafiete Valley see T. J. Hutchinson, 1873, Vol. 1, pp. 138-9. 28 See Appendix A, items No. A 3.3 ? 5. 29 T. J. Hutchinson, 1873, Vol. 1, p. 138, figure on p. 139 (our Fig. 43). from the Macabi Islands.30 The advantage of this comparison comes from the fact that the British Museum woodcarvings were found with a pottery fragment of unmistakable Mochica manufacture (no. 8 on Fig. 26) .31 Apart from the well-modeled realistic style of the wood carvings, the Mochica pottery association con firms their identification as Mochica work. The depth relations among the Chincha Is land finds may now be treated. The method will be open to innumerable questions, so that an effort must be made to set forth all the assump tions upon which the method is based. The method itself is rudimentary in its simplicity. The depth of a find is taken as a direct indica tion of the time at which it was deposited on the islands. For the Chincha Islands, it is assumed, from the evidence of photographs and early surveys of the guano caps,32 that the guano was laid down in horizontal layers, at a regular rate on all parts of the islands; in other words, that the islands were completely and steadily popu lated by ubiquitous bird colonies,33 and that their production of guano, if subject to varia tions, varied cyclically in regular short- and long-term phases. This assumption is supported by the flat, table-top character of the rock sur face of the three main islands, North, Central, and South Chincha. Second, it is assumed that over secular periods the ratio between deposit of the guano and surface erosion by wind re mained constant. Third, the human exploita tion of guano, from Mochica times to ca. 1840, was not only regular but negligible, never approaching a large-scale ecological disturb 30 See Appendix A, items No. C 3.7 ? 16. 31 Wiener (1880, p. 580) figures another set of wood and pottery specimens as coming from the Lobos Islands (Fig. 39). These correspond so exactly with the Hamburg and British Museum specimens that they might be taken for parts of the same find. Wiener's collections are housed at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris. The curators there were unable to identify Wiener's figures with specimens at present in Paris. On page 617, Wiener figures another Mochica prisoner vessel, as from the Lobos Islands (Fig. 39). On page 650, a wooden head, very much like that of Hamburg No. 2, is shown with the same provenance (Fig. 41).

Fourth, depo sition ceased on the Chincha Islands during the 1840's, with the beginning of industrial exploi tation.34 Fifth, it is assumed that mechanical compression of the guano at deep levels in the cap was insignificant, as suggested by old photographs (Fig. 15).36 Sixth, it is assumed that the deposit of artifacts occurred at the sur face of the guano cap rather than in pits or shafts. This assumption is not susceptible of proof. Seventh, we assume that depth-recorded finds, regardless of horizontal position on the islands, are equally and uniformly significant of time-relations.36 Finally, in generalizing upon the depth-relations among finds, we assume that the "date" of deposition is in all cases roughly contemporaneous (within a generation) with the date of manufacture. Proof here is also lacking. The maximum depth of the guano cap may be taken as 44.7 m., by averaging the deepest soundings taken on the three islands of the Chincha group during 1853.37 Since it is certain that deposition ceased altogether about 1850, this year may be taken as a terminal date. Among the depth-recorded artifacts, the critical specimen is the Bollaert slab, for an absolute date is easily ascertained by stylistic and his toric evidence. This date has been fixed between ^Stevenson (1825-29, Vol. 1, p. 357) observed only "several small vessels constantly employed" at the Chinchas in 1825. In 1840, Tschudi (1866-69, Vol. 5, pp. 374-5) saw ships arrive at the islands only rarely. But in October, 1858, a great flotilla was steadily engaged, and no birds were in evidence, although Tschudi had seen "mil lions" in 1840. 38 Contrast the views held by Murphy, 1936, Vol. 1, p. 292. 38 Among many unproved assumptions, this is the weak est. Canas (1854, p'. 25) gives areas and volumes of guano for each island. Area divided into volume yields a mean depth of 12.12 m. This suggests the lenticular form of the guano cap, thinning towards the periphery of the island. (See Murphy, 1936, Vol. 1, PL 16.) But the depth-recorded finds were made late in the removal of the cap, and there fore near the deep center, in stacks such as the one shown in Figure 15. The only exception is the Bollaert slab, found in 1847. "If the Bollaert slab was under an atypically thin periph eral layer, all the postulated dates based on its use are too old. It would be as well to point out that this possibility, which is the greatest potential source of error, can only lead to a false expansion of the chronology." (G. E. H.) 37 Caiias, 1854, pp. 20-3. This surveyor's depths are given in Peruvian varas (.8475 m.). His deepest soundings: North Chincha, 50 varas; Central Chincha, 56 varas; South Chincha, 52 varas. 1575 and 1600, with some likelihood that the years around 1575 correspond with the manu facture and installation of the arms on the island. Fifteen hundred seventy-five will there fore be taken as the year corresponding to the 18-foot, or 5.5 m. depth at which the slab was found. Hence, 275 years elapsed during the ac cumulation of 5.5 m. of guano. Dividing depth by time, we find that the annual thickness of deposit was on the order of 20 mm., in the com pacted, eroded, and layered condition imposed by the presence of the bird colonies. At this rate the accumulation of guano in the deep stacks would approach 2 meters per cen tury. The initiation of the deposits then is seen to fall roughly in the fourth century B.C. (Fig. 27). The remaining depth-recorded artifacts from the Chincha Islands may now be given their secular positions by extrapolation. The depth of 10.4 m. for the silver fishes places them, and the artifacts found at similar depths, in the fourteenth century a.d. It may be pointed out that nothing in their style is inconsistent with such a dating in late pre-Inca time.38 The depth of 19.8 m. for the Mochica-associated artifacts reported by Hutchinson, brings us to the ninth century a.d., a dating in full agreement with the most recent estimate of relative North Coast chronology.39 That the same rate of secular accumulation holds for certain other island groups is sug gested by the well documented find of Mochica artifacts under 60 English feet of guano on the Macabi Islands. (See p. 43.) It should be pointed out that other datings than 1575 are of course possible for the Bollaert slab (Fig. 16). But other datings are confined within fairly narrow limits. The lower limit is the Spanish Conquest, ca. 1535, when early European settlement on Paracas Bay might have produced our slab. If 1535 is taken, then 5.5 m. accumulated in 315 years, at a rate of 17 mm. annually, or 1.70 m. per century. At this rate, the Mochica-associated artifacts at 19.8 m. would fall in the late seventh century, which is not unreasonable, by existing relative estimates. But the silver fishes (Fig. 19) at 10.4 m. and the nearby objects would have been left on the islands in the thirteenth century, which is perhaps too early, especially for the 38 On the Inca conquest of the valleys of the south coast of Peru, under Topa Inca ca. 1470, see Rowe, 1946, p. 207. 39 Strong, 1947, pp. 459-64.

If the Bollaert slab was deposited ca. 1640 (an important date in the history of Pisco town) the guano accumulated at the rate of 2.6 m. per century, with an initial date in the second cen tury a.d. Hence any date later than 1640 for the Bollaert slab places the Mochica-associated find (19.8 m.) at an impossibly late time, after the twelfth century a.d. The argument on which this essay is based? that depth directly indicates the age of guano artifacts under certain conditions?should not depend at any point upon the biological history of the guano islands, if it is to bring confirma tion to the results of such a biological history. Another line of evidence, fortunately, permits an independent definition of both lower and upper limits. As to a lower limit at 1535 or thereabouts, the possibility is dispelled by early colonial writings that reveal Spanish unawareness of the guano resources of the Chincha Islands. Cieza de Leon, writing before 1550. spoke of these is lands, and incorrectly described the guano caps as sand hills. He wrote that the group near Sangallan (in Paracas Bay, i.e., the Chinchas and nearby rocks), a little over four leagues from the coast, were "seven or eight other small islets, some high and others low, uninhabited, and without wood or water, tree, shrub, or any thing else, except seals and sand hills [arenales] .... The Indians, according to their own ac count, used to go to these islands to make sacri fices, and it is presumed that great treasure is buried on them. . . . " This fascinating account is our earliest European mention of Indian visits to the islands, and it proves that before 1550 the Indians had abandoned the habit, and that guano from the Chinchas was still un known to Europeans. But Cieza knew of guano and its use as fertilizer, for in another passage of the same work he spoke of the Indians' use of guano from the islands off the coast of Tara paca, several hundred miles farther south than the Chinchas.40 Later writers repeated Cieza's remarks without further verification. Lopez de Velasco, the eminent cosmographer, writing be fore 1574, used the same words, like Reginaldo de Lizarraga, who, ca. 1605-10, followed Cieza 40 Cieza de Le6n, 1864, pp. 27, 265-6 (Markham transla tion). This work was first published in 1552. The writer has verified Markham's translation of "sand hills" in the Antwerp edition of 1553 (p. 14). closely.41 These writers were aware of guano and described its use at Arica and on the Tarapaca coast in general.

Two sources, however, indicate that guano from the islands off the central coast came into commercial use between 1560 and 1580.

Herrera y Tordesillas (1601, p. 60) is another geographer who repeats Cieza without verification. It is likely that Garcilaso de la Vega, who left Peru in 1560, also knew no more than Cieza (1553, Fol. 102).</page><page sequence="12">40 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 putes over ownership.42 Jose de Acosta, writing ca. 1580-90, described the guano islands of the central coast briefly and specified that the ma terial was used for fertilizer in Lunaguana Valley, just south of the Rio Cafiete. The source may have been either the Asia island group or the Chinchas, for Lunaguana Valley is roughly equidistant from the two.43 The upper limit for the Bollaert slab may be fixed by reference to the economic history of the port on Paracas Bay, namely, Pisco Harbor. As pointed out earlier, the formal foundation of such a harbor town occurred ca. 1572. The rapid development of the great mercury mines at Huancavelica, however, soon necessitated the foundation of another seaport nearer the natu ral outlet from Huancavelica. This was found in Chincha Valley, well to the north of the harbor at Pisco. By 1576, Pisco was forbidden to ship mercury, and with this interdict Pisco declined as a harbor. In 1587, the unhappy town was sacked by English pirates; all mercury was passing through the port in Chincha Valley, and Pisco itself was subordinated by viceregal order to the corregimiento located at Valverde de lea, some 70 kilometers from Pisco.44 Not until 1640 did Pisco Harbor revive briefly, when Viceroy Mancera attempted to re-establish its activity.45 But new disasters soon befell Pisco. In the 1640's, clouds of guano dust blowing over the region made the site uninhabitable, and in 1687 an earthquake and tidal wave led the settlers to 42 Apimtiamientos para el buen gobiemo del Peru, MS. cited by Jimenez de la Espada, 1881, Appendix 2, p. cxxxviii. A-3 Acosta, 1940, pp. 328-9. A much later writer, in 1792, reports that Chincha Island guano was mainly used in Chancay Valley (Ureta, 1792, p. 220). Cf. Tschudi, 1847, pp. 239-42. Chancay Valley had consumed ca. 33000 36000 fanegas (cwts.) annually since 1790. "Asia Island is perhaps an unlikely source; the island had little guano in the last century, as its form does not permit much accumulation. The Chincha Islands are far more likely, particularly since Ureta (1792) and Humboldt noted that boats regularly brought guano from the Chinchas to Chancay." (G. E. H.) 44 Foundation of Pisco ca. 1572: Gobernantes del Peru, 1921-26, Vol. 4, p. 126 (hereafter GP). Pisco forbidden to ship mercury: GP, Vol. 5, p. 486. Pisco sacked by pirates and subordinated to lea: GP, Vol. 10, pp. 312, 335-7. All mercury shipped through Chincha Harbor, GP, Vol. 10, p. 271. Cf. Perez de Torres (1749, p. 10) on Chincha Harbor ca. 1588, when Pisco shipped only the wines of lea. On one mercury shipping route, see Whitaker, 1941, p. 14. 45 Montesinos, 1906, Vol. 2, p. 258. The name was changed to San Clemente de Mancera, and the town was given jurisdiction over the "pampa de Chincha." abandon the seashore and build anew two miles inland.46 In brief, Pisco flourished best under Viceroy Toledo in the 1570's, before the creation of the port in Chincha Valley and before the incur sions of pirates. The economic history of Pisco and the beginnings of colonial guano exploita tion allow the Bollaert slab to be assigned to the decade of the 1570's. The date is further con firmed by the style of the carving. (See p. 34.) Various other aspects of the guano island ma terial merit discussion, aspects that do not re late to absolute chronology. The artifacts suggest a special guano island apparatus and iconography. Cieza, Garcilaso, and Frezier mention ceremonies and sacrifices.47 The num ber of wooden staffs suggests an undefined ac tivity specially significant on the islands (items A 1.2, A 1.3, A 2.1, B 2.02, C 3.1, C 4.11, etc). Great layers of cloth deposits, as reported by various writers, probably answer to ceremonial requirements (items C 3.7, C 3.01). The pres ence of many nude prisoner figures in wood and pottery (items A 1.15, C 3.10, etc.), suggests a penalty for abuse or misappropriation of the islands and their resources, especially in the Mochica period. Headless female mummies (item C 3.01) and traces of domestic architec ture (items B 2.1, C 3.1-6) point to sustained habitation. Finally, a Mochica vessel (Fig. 29) describes the visit of balsa-rafts to the islands. A human being, in hieratic posture, suggests ceremonial behavior.48 Throughout this repertory, however, certain styles of mainland industries are conspicuously lacking. The wares of Nazca Valley and the textiles of Paracas Peninsula are not known from the Chincha Islands. On no island group has any specimen of Tiahuanacoid style been recorded. Also lacking from the record are wares such as lea Geometric and Chancay. That the ceramics of Nazca and lea valleys 46 Clouds of guano dust: Cobo, 1890-93, Vol. 1, p. 180 (written 1652 but probably referring to events of the 1640's); Anonymous, 1940-43, Vol. 14, p. 30.

(After Squier, 1871-72.) should be lacking is astonishing, in the presence of Mochica artifacts that are usually supposed not to extend so far south. In any case, a re vision of our concepts of Mochica extension is clearly indicated (Note 27). Such a revision at once suggests the hypothesis that the success of the Mochica cultural pattern may have de pended in part upon a technique of guano fertilization of arid coastal valleys. Real proof, however, is at present lacking. Coastal Tia huanaco peoples may have depended more upon highland connections for subsistence than upon intensive coastal agriculture. Nazca and lea valley peoples never achieved widespread cul tural domination over their remote neighbors. The Mochica pattern was the only coastal style, to present knowledge, that achieved distribu tion, however sporadic, throughout the entire system of north, central, and south coast val leys. The significance of this approach to absolute time, in relation to the early cultures dis covered by J. B. Bird in northern Chile49 (Shell and Fish Hook culture on fossil guano at Punta Pichalo) and in relation to climatological his tory in the South Pacific, has been treated else where by Professor Hutchinson.60 Here it is necessary only to comment upon the contracted time-scale, in terms of the Mochica finds at 60 62 feet. If these are objects of Late Mochica style, then the tenth to thirteenth centuries are open for post-Mochica and pre-Inca cultures. If 49 Bird, 1943. 6? G.E. Hutchinson, 1948. Fig. 31.

The answers to this and other questions were prob ably destroyed unwittingly during the com mercial destruction of the guano deposits.51 51 It is far from unlikely that, once aware of the impor tance of guano archaeology, curators here and abroad will</page><page sequence="14">42 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 The truth remains that several assumptions on which this work is based are arbitrarily taken.

(After Dulignon, 1884.) discover appreciable numbers of depth-recorded artifacts not known to the writer. Great Britain, however, has been thoroughly searched; the writer and Professor G.E.

Only two collections yielded relevant material (items C 3.7-16, C 3.01). Islands, without depending upon these assump tions, shows an order in depth that corresponds to order in time. At any moment, examples of depth-recorded artifacts, now unknown to the writer, may come to light. If such artifacts de part from the observed correspondence between depth and date, then the hypothesis will have to be modified or abandoned. But at present no reliably recorded object violates the time-depth correspondence. For the present, therefore, the dates contained in Figure 27 can be considered reasonable, with Mochica falling between the seventh and eleventh centuries.</page><page sequence="15">kubler] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 43 APPENDIX A In order to catalog the objects and yet to leave room in the enumeration for future expan sion, a decimal classification is used. The pre fixes A, B, C, designate the character of the find as depth-recorded (A); under unstratified con ditions (B); at vague, improbable, or unre corded depths (C). The numerals before the decimal point designate the island group: Chinchas (1.); Guanape (2.); Macabi (3.); "Lobos" (4.). Following the decimal point, a numeral other than zero indicates that a draw ing, a photograph, or the object itself is avail able for study. If a zero follows the decimal point, no visual evidence is known. In groups of objects constituting a single find, each object is cataloged by a separate number where visual evidence is at hand. A 1.1. The Bollaert slab (Fig. 16), discovered on North Chincha Island under 18 feet of guano in 1847, has been lost to view since 1860. When the drawing was published in 1859, the slab was "about to be presented to the British Museum," but no record of such a gift has been discovered. The drawing was shown in 1946 to Albert Van de Put, F.S.A., Late Keeper, Library, Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Mr. Van de Put could not assign a coherent mean ing to the inscriptions. The style of the armorial carving, however, led him to write (in Utt., Feb. 18, 1946): "With regard to the date of the slab, the shield shape is of, no doubt, Italian (Tuscan?) derivation, first quarter of the XVI century. ..." Mr. Van de Put points out that "the carver has not gone very far with the cartouche working of the outline, which tends to the baroque but is rather se verely plain in comparison with what was being turned out by the third quarter of the XVI century in Europe . . . ," and he concludes that "it seems probable that a date about 1575-1600 is indicated." Inquiries addressed to Father Rub6n Vargas Ugarte and to Dr. Jorge Zevallos in Peru during 1944 failed to yield any information concerning the grant of municipal arms to the port of Pisco. Similar inquiries in Spain remained fruitless. It is certain, however, that Pisco was granted arms, and it is likely that these arms, when located, will correspond with those of the Bollaert slab. Quarterings with topographic allusions are not uncommon among Latin American mu nicipal arms (e.g., Patzcuaro, Mexico).

Jenkins, Director of the Peabody Museum, Salem, Mass., describes this object (in Utt., July 8, 1944) as follows, "... a god-stick or club said to have been found 15-20 feet below the surface [on the Chincha Islands] and given to the Essex Institute by Capt. J. B. King in 1861. It is about 1J in. in diam. and 27 in. long. A head is crudely carved on one end, and the stick tapers to a point at the other end." (Fig. 17.) A 1.3. When discussing the Chincha Islands, T. J. Hutchinson reproduced an engraving of a wooden staff head, carved in the form of a nude, seated, and helmeted female (Fig. 18). The legend accompanying the engraving states that it is a "wooden idol found at a depth of 33 feet under guano." The text offers no further details. Bibliography: T. J. Hutchinson, 1873, Vol. 1, p. 108. A 1.4-13. Ten silver fishes were given to E. G. Squier by Henry Swayne, a landowner in Caiiete Valley, who ob tained them from Juan Pardo, the Italian master of a coast ing vessel before 1867. Pardo declared they were extracted from beneath 32 feet of guano on the Chincha Islands. At the same time there was found "the body of a female, lack ing the head, which, however, was discovered at some distance from the skeleton. The chest, breasts, and ribs were covered with thin sheets of gold." This quotation is from Swayne's letter to Squier. In a penciled catalog of his collection, Squier recorded the depth as 34 feet. It is not explicitly stated that the fishes and the skeleton were parts of one single find. The fishes were acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in 1875 and cataloged as No. 1010 (Fig. 19).

Hutchinson, discussing the Chincha Is lands, reproduced an engraving of this object (Fig. 20) with the legend, "wooden idol found at a depth of 35 feet under the guano." The accompanying text mentions a "wooden idol discovered at a depth of thirty-two feet." Bibliography: T. J. Hutchinson, 1873, Vol. 1, p. 105. A 1.15-19. These five objects (Fig. 21) from beneath 62 feet of guano on the Chincha Islands are known only through the wood engraving reproduced by T. J. Hutchinson. Hutchinson also reproduced another engraving, showing eleven objects of Mochica style, in his discussion of the Chinchas. He described them as "relics of household gods and regal emblems, taken from a depth not known to me, but very, very deep. ..." The resemblances to the Mochica pieces from Macabi in the British Museum are striking and were commented upon by Hutchinson in a footnote. Hutchinson further stated that on the Chincha Islands, "we have had excavated from a depth of sixty feet in the guano regalia of the old Kings, stone and wooden idols, as well as, now and then, some pieces of gold." The present whereabouts of the Hutchinson collections is unknown. In 1874r-75 these collections, consisting of at least five cases, were exhibited in London at the Bethnal Green Museum. Correspondence with the Victoria and Albert Museum, which ultimately absorbed the Bethnal Green Museum, has yielded no trace of the collections. Bibliography: T. J.

A 2.2. Between 1869 and 1873, not long after the begin nings of commercial exploitation of the Guanape Islands, numerous artifacts were encountered. T. J. Hutchinson wrote that "at a depth of thirty-two feet under the guano . . . has been found the body of a flattened Penguin, with a piece of cloth underneath. . . . Several idols have been dis covered here likewise, and the Chinese workmen have turned up gold ornaments, which, of course, were at once appropriated and partitioned, according to their ordinary usages in cases of treasure trove." Of the penguin, Hutchin son noted that "in its flattened position it is only half an inch in thickness . . . ." The illustration (Fig. 23) accom panying this passage is not clear enough to allow any infer ences concerning the style or technique of the cloth. Bibliography: T. J. Hutchinson, 1873, Vol. 2, p. 129. A 3.3-5. On January 18, 1871, eight or nine wooden fig ures were encountered on North Macabi Island at a depth of 60 English feet. On February 28 the governor of the Guanape and Macabi groups signed an affidavit attesting the conditions of the find. This certificate was accompanied by a photograph (now lost) of the objects. A Lima mer chant, Wilhelm Scheel, acquired the pieces and donated them to the Johanneum Naturhistorisches Museum in Hamburg. Only three specimens arrived at their destina tion, where they were exhibited in 1873-74. The first, No. 1 on Figure 24 is reported as 73 cm. high; No. 2 as 37 cm.; and No. 3 as 33 cm. The other specimens lost in transit were five or six in number, "meist sitzend mit unterge schlagenen Beinen, darunter mindestens noch 3 mit dem um den Hals geschlungenen Stricke." Bibliography: Bolan, 1874, p. 93; Virchow, 1873, pp. 153-4. B 2.1. An important group of artifacts was encountered on South Guanape Island in 1863-64. The find was made by J. P. Davis of Boston, an engineer then engaged by the Peruvian government to survey the guano stacks of the north coast. Davis found a wooden female figure ca. 1 foot high (Fig. 30); three pottery figures ca. 4 inches high; and two water jars, of which one portrayed a fish. The discovery occurred at the edge of a cliff about 450 feet high, "among the ruins of what appeared to have been a stone hut, covered to a slight depth by huanu." E. G. Squier noted that the large wooden figure (Fig. 30) was "so completely saturated with the salts of huanu that it has very nearly the specific gravity of marble." Bibliography: Squier, 1871-72, p. 53. B 2.01. In 1871 the report reached London of the dis covery of artifacts on North Guanape Island. The editor of Nature published the report in the following terms: "be neath forty feet of guano, a cavity was come upon, whic h, on the removal of the guano, was found to be a cave, leading downwards further forty feet. . . . It . . . contained . . . well-preserved sea-fowl and other birds, lizards' eggs. . . . In many cases, the color of the eggs is preserved. The cracks and fissures in the walls of the caves were found filled with solidified ammoniacal salt. Two pieces of earthenware vases were found, bearing figures, also two gold earrings, and a bundle of medicinal herbs tied up in woven cloth." The report also mentions "rude representations of the human figure, cut in very hard wood." It seems clear that the entrance to the cave was sealed by 40 feet of guano, and that the objects therefore antedated this stratum. Bibliography: Nature, 1871, Vol. 4, p. 394, London; Squier, 1871-72, p. 48; Gonzalez de la Rosa, 1908, p. 42. B 2.02. The governor of the Guanape Islands recorded a number of finds on South Guanape before 1873. We owe this record to the diligence of M. Gonzalez de la Rosa, who sent a questionnaire concerning guano archaeology to the officials supervising the industry. The questionnaire was sent from Paris between 1869 and 1872. In 1873, Jose* Marfa Garcfa replied from South Guanape that objects had been encountered at depths of between 3 and 4 meters. He mentioned "idolos y utensilios de madera negra y chonta, los primeros representando un hombre en cuclillas, con los brazos cruzados sobre el pecho y descansando en la cabeza cuadrada en un palo redondo, de 8 centim6tros de diametro y de metro y medio de largo." There were also "bastones largos o varas, algunos tallados, y canaletes, que son una especie de remos cortos con pala ancha, tallada esta con figuras de distinta clase de pescados." Garcfa noted further that neither human remains nor objects of stone had been found. Bibliography: Gonzalez de la Rosa, 1908, pp. 40-1. C 1.1. Gold objects from the Chincha Islands were ex hibited in New York at the meeting of the American Ethnological Society in 1859. The pieces were reported to have been found "with thirty feet or more of [guano] resting upon them." A sheet gold figure in the find can be illus trated (Fig. 31). No record of the appearance of the other specimens has been found. These other objects were a gold, tube-like extension to the figure illustrated (Fig. 31), and two gold cups of the weight of five dollars each. Figure 31 weighed a little less than twelve gold dollars. The pieces were exhibited by Thomas Ewbank, who prepared a drawing of each piece for his communication to the Society. They were then the property of Trevor &amp; Col gate, the Wall Street bullion dealers, and had been in the latter's possession for about a year. Bibliography: Squier, 1871-72, p. 49. C 1.2-3. In the Marine Museum at Mystic, Connecticut, are two specimens of Inca pottery from the Chincha Is lands (Fig. 35). They were found during or before 1860. The first is an "aryballos," about 85 inches high and lightish brown in color. The second is a blackware vessel, shaped like a six-pointed star. Descriptions, drawings, and infor mation concerning the pieces were provided by Carl C. Cutler, Secretary of the Marine Historical Association in Mystic. The pieces formerly belonged to Captain George B.</page><page sequence="17">kubler] A REAPPRAISAL OF PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY 45 Wendell of the ship "Galatea." Mr. A. 0. Vietor, of the Yale Library, informed the writer that this ship was en gaged in the Callao-New York trade during 1859-60. Captain Wendell acquired pieces from Commander Jones of the Peruvian Navy at the Chincha Islands on October 6, 1860, with the information that they came from "200 feet under the surface of the guano." A letter from Commander Jones to Captain Wendell gives "300 feet." (Communi cated by Captain Wendell's son, Arthur R. Wendell.) That these depths are improbable emerges from the fact that the guano caps never exceeded 56 varas (168 feet). C 1.4. A golden figure of a female (Fig. 32), from the Chincha Islands, is in the Museum fur Volkerkunde, Berlin. As part of the Gretzer Collection (No. 31760) it entered the Museum in 1907. This collection, formed by a merchant of Lima during 33 years in Peru, contains objects acquired roughly between 1870 and 1900. The piece is 15.5 cm. high and weighs 16 gms.

During 1872, Louis Agassiz, aboard the Hassler, stopped in Paracas Bay and acquired a number of objects from the Chincha Islands. The specimens certainly known to have come from the Chincha Islands are 18 objects of silver, now in Peabody Museum, Harvard University under the accession number 73-6-30. No depths were recorded, and the style of the pieces is generally amorphous. The writer owes photographs of these specimens to the courtesy of J. O. Brew and Donald Scott.

A human figure of unspecified material and tech nique was collected at the Guanape Islands in 1826. This is the earliest recorded find of artifact character on the guano islands. That such finds were common before 1848 is suggested by Pickett (1848, pp. 37-8): "In the guano de posets [sic], and far below the surface, ancient tools and instruments are frequently found. ..." The original of the Goodwin figure was long kept at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, but it can no longer be found there. Fortunately, a cast was made for the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester. The So ciety in 1910 effected an exchange with Peabody Museum, Harvard University, and the cast is now in Cambridge (accession 10-47, specimen 76832). C 2.2. A helmeted, cup-holding wooden figure (Fig. 33) from the Guanape Islands is in the Museum fur Volker kunde, Berlin. It stands 118 cm. high and it entered the Museum in 1890 with the Maier Collection. The forms may be compared with those of item A 1.3, although the carving of fish forms on the flesh parts is lack ing in the more naturalistic treatment of the latter. Bibliography: Schmidt, 1929, pp. 413, 599. C 2.01. Among the most puzzling reports of Guanape Island guano archaeology is the brief notice in a London magazine in 1871, describing "gold ornaments and other objects . . . cloth . . . said to have paintings of animals and symbols, of which the colors were well preserved ... a stratum of woolen rags, five feet thick, and reaching over a mile in extent."

In the ruins of a dwelling (otherwise not described) were found the following objects: 1) One golden vase, ca. 15 cm. high. 2) Four wooden "idols" (Fig. 34, Nos. 1, la).

These specimens, to judge from the style of the wood carving, were all of Mochica manufacture. They represent the most complete known assembly of Mochica domestic artifacts anterior to the discovery of intact Mochica graves by W. D. Strong in 1946 (Strong 1947, pp. 453-82).

During 1871, Josiah Harris exhibited at the Ethnographical Society in London a collection of objects from the Macabi Islands. The collection was discovered during November and December, 1870, on North Macabi, in an area of 80 square yards, at depths of 14 to 43 and more feet. Cotton rags were also shown. On North Macabi, these had "extended many hundred yards, at an average thickness of five feet, and below a deposit of several feet of guano." According to Adrian Digby, Curator of the Department of Ethnology, British Museum, the collection was pre sented to the British Museum on September 15, 1871 by Josiah Harris and A. W. Franks, where the objects of pottery and wood were registered as Nos. 7416-47. Several have been illustrated by T. A. Joyce.

They closely resemble the Chincha Island specimens figured by Hutchin son (Fig. 38), but are clearly different from Hutchinson's, for this writer noted the resemblances himself in a footnote.

On the Macabi Islands before 1873, Jose Maria Garcia reported the discovery of pottery vessels of various sizes, some representing birds. Large clay containers held sheet gold figures and masks. Vast quantities of cotton cloth in bad condition were encountered, as well as many female, headless mummy bundles. Several wood staffs appeared, some 60-90 cm. long and 5 cm. in diameter, rounded at the head and tapering to a point. All these bbjects were met in the 4r-5 m. level, as well as above and below this level. Gonzalez de la Rosa supposed that the headless female mummies pertained to virginal sacrifices, and that the islands were a sacred cemetery. A mummy from the guano islands is preserved in the Horniman Museum, London, but the writer was unable to ascertain whether it is headless and female. Bibliography: Gonzalez de la Rosa, 1908, pp. 42-4. C 4.1-12. Charles Wiener, who traveled in South America between 1875 and 1877, formed and published a large collection of archaeological materials. Among these, many specimens are figured as coming from the Lobos Islands. It is not clear which group Wiener had in mind. No such islands are described in the text of his travels. The map of his travels, however, shows the "Islas de Lobos" off Chiclayo, in a position corresponding to the group now known as the Islas Lobos de Afuera, a well-known guano station (Fig. 14). "The occurrence of any wooden artifacts on either the Lobos de Afuera or Lobos de Tierra groups is most improba ble. The guano on these islands is in general poor in nitrogen and has evidently undergone extensive leaching. The oc casional wet conditions implied by this fact would militate against the preservation of wood. The artifacts in question are far more likely to have come from Macabi." (G. E. Hutchinson.) Wiener's objects (Figs. 39-42) are all of Mochica style and compare closely to the Mochica specimens from other island groups. The items are as follows: C 4.1 Seated pottery "prisoner" (Fig. 40). C 4.2 Wooden vessel rim fragment, with modeled, running warrior, as on C 3.7. (Fig. 39, left, center). C 4.3 Seated wooden "prisoner" (Fig. 39, top, left). C 4.4 Staff head with standing, nude, male "prisoner" (Fig. 39, top, center). C 4.5 Seated wooden "prisoner" (Fig. 37, top, right). C 4.6 Seated wooden "prisoner"; flaring neck at top of head; hands bound behind back (Fig. 39, right, sec ond from top). C 4.7 Seated wooden "prisoner" (Fig. 39, right, third from top). C 4.8 Seated wooden "prisoner" (Fig. 39, bottom, left). C 4.9 Standing wooden warrior (Fig. 39, bottom, center). C 4.10 Mummy bundle head in wood (Fig. 41). C 4.11 Staff of wood, the head carved as a throne and canopy, containing a seated figure, (Fig. 42, left). C 4.12 Staff of wood similar to C 4.11 (Fig. 42, right). Items C 4.9 and C 4.4 are closely similar to the specimens figured by T. J. Hutchinson (Fig. 43), from Cafiete Valley. The others may be compared to the specimens in Figure 38. It is possible, but unlikely, that Wiener copied Hutchin son's engravings, changing the proveniences and adding new details. The Wiener collections in Paris, as the writer has been informed by H. Reichlen and John Rowe, do not include these objects, and they are not enumerated in the registers of the Wiener collections.</page><page sequence="22">50 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 4 APPENDIX B Dr. G. Evelyn Hutchinson of Yale University has added the following remarks. The guano deposits of Peru con sisted of the faeces of sea-birds which had undergone a slight diagenetic change in conformity with the great aridity of the country. The modern bird colonies apparently produce from 8 to 10 cms. a year under the favorable con ditions afforded by the best islands. Taking the lower esti mate of the rate of increase in thickness of a deposit, it would require about 593 years to produce the thickest de posit recorded, on Central Chincha Island. The photograph of the section on Central Chincha Island, taken by Captain Merriman, shows a vertical section of the deposit in which 22 bands can be counted. It is evident from the height of a man standing on the cliff that the thickness of these bands in aggregate was 150-170 cms., or each band was 6.8^7.8 cms. thick. The stratigraphy therefore suggests annual deposition at the same rate as today. There is, how ever, some evidence from the lower part of the photograph and also from contemporary descriptions, that thinner layers occurred. The stratification appears, notably from a pair of photographs published in the Boletin de la Compania Administradora del Guano, Vol. 11, pp. 472 and 483, to have been remarkably horizontal, at least on the North Island. There is some evidence, to be presented in full in a forth coming monograph, that the nature of the bird colonies had changed during the period immediately prior to exploitation in the middle of the nineteenth century and that this change had led to a loss of guano, through the activities of burrow ing birds. Part of the discrepancy between the archaeologi cal and stratigraphic estimate of the rate of accumulation is perhaps due to wind erosion at a time when burrowing birds had become common. The archaeological evidence from the Bollaert slab, which anyhow may have come from near the periphery of the deposit where its thickness was reduced, therefore tends to give values for the rates of ac cumulation of guano which are too low. The result of wind erosion would be to make any old object appear older when measured in terms of the time taken to cover the Bollaert slab. Professor Kubler's chronology, therefore, is most un likely to be over-contracted; if it is in error it is likely that it is not contracted enough. As his argument stands his conclusions appear inherently probable. The full data will be available shortly in a "Survey of Contemporary Knowledge of Biogeochemistry, III, The Biogeochemistry of Vertebrate Excretion," to appear in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History.b2 Yale University New Haven, Connecticut 62 G.
