<plain_text><page sequence="1">521 ARTISANS AND INTELLECTUALS IN THE GERMAN REVOLUTION OF 1848 ALVIN W. GOULDNER Marxism arose as part of a larger, more diffuse proliferation of political organizations in the nineteenth century. "The nineteenth century was par excellence a century of organization," writes P. H. Noyes. "Hosts of associa- tions sprang up, from secret revolutionary conspiracies and public political parties to trade unions, singing and gymnastic clubs, temperance and ladies political societies."' Noyes sees the rapid development of such associations as a response to the decline of the old hierarchical society and the need for new group memberships to compensate for people's growing anonymity. One may add that many West Europeans, both rural and urban, had long acquired considerable organizational experience and competence, one of the most important such groups being the artisans with their tradition of guild experience. Thus when the old arrangements began to deteriorate in Europe, there were many with ample organizational competence to begin a rebuilding that might provide them with special-purpose organizations to protect their threatened interests and to serve as rudimentary new communities. As a "real historical movement," Marxism was a fusion of ideology with organization, each bleeding into and defining the other. To view theory only as organization's steering mechanism, however, is an anthropomorphic reification. Theory is not self-maintaining, but is strategically situated in a relatively few privileged persons who steer or, more precisely, who attempt to steer. Their interpretations and applications of theory are selectively struc- tured by the privileged positions they occupy and seek to retain. The content of theory itself only provides a provisional grammar - part cause and part post-factum ideology - allowing or disallowing a large variety of interpreta- tions and steering maneuvers, and often merely serving to justify strategies based on interests, expedience, and prudence. In what follows, these general considerations alert us to selected aspects of Marxism's early history. Out of an interplay between this theoretical sketch2 Copyright ? 1983 by Janet Walker Gouldner</page><page sequence="2">522 and the historical sketch to follow, there will emerge an account of Marx- ism's group and class origins. What Marxists often regard as Marx's history-making encounter with the "working class" is wrongly understood on several counts. For this encounter was, first, neither with a "class" - one can never encounter a class as such - nor, second, was it primarily with "workers" in any Marxist sense of factory proletarians. Marx's early encounter was with artisans, not the proletariat. As modern social historians have shown, it was artisans, not the proletariat, who exhibited the greatest militancy during the 1848 revolutions and, indeed, before then. Marx's relationship to these radical artisans, moreover, was primarily a relationship with their organizations, particularly secret societies such as the League of the Just, and with the militants and activists in them. Standing between Marx and the "working class," then, were the proliferating new organizations. Although often radical or revolutionary, their members and, still more, their leaders were not factory hands, whatever their profes- sions of devotion to the "proletariat" - a term then increasingly current. Thus one of these early organizations, The Society of Seasons, had as its four chief revolutionary agents a cabinet-maker, a copper-turner, a gilder, and a jour- nalist. It is notable that artisans were then connected with intellectuals or near intellectuals such as journalists. Journalism was an occupation to which artisans and others who had failed often turned. Indeed, the differentiation between plainly artisanal occupations and more intellectual ones was consid- erably less developed then than now, as formal tertiary education was less universally requisite for entrance to many intellectual or professional occu- pations. At least since Rudolf Stadelmann's pathbreaking work, Soziale und poli- tische Geschichte der Revolution von 1848 (1948), it has been clear that artisans played a major role in organizing rebellion in Europe. Stadelmann argues that sheer economic deprivation does not generate revolution; rather, "oppression creates discontent and opposition only where it is perceived as injustice."3 Stadelmann also finds that it was artisans uprooted by the rising factory system who were the most militant revolutionaries in the German Revolution of 1848. Fragmented and without uniform trade regulations, Germany was late to industrialize. But as factories developed, free trade regulations were promulgated, the Zollverein increased its market area, and railroads grew and brought goods from Prussia or England, competition among the artisans increased and their socioeconomic position deteriorated. Though commonly injured by the rising factory system, lines of cleavage</page><page sequence="3">523 appeared soon enough between journeymen and masters who could hire larger numbers of unemployed workers; the masters began to set up what were in effect many small factories. By the time of the depression of the late 1840s, journeymen were desperate and alienated, and became increasingly involved in many political projects and secret societies. At that time, more- over, the largest part of the working class consisted of artisans and guild members. According to Hamerow there were still about 2,800,000 artisans in Prussia, but only about 571,000 workers in factories.4 Indeed, the artisans have even been pictured as an expanding group whose numbers were grow- ing more rapidly than that of the population at large.5 Members at all levels of the artisan hierarchy defined their personal identity in relation to their craft and guild. They saw their future in terms of a predictable movement up this traditional hierarchy. In large part, social differences between master and journeymen were accepted because the latter might hope to become masters and perhaps even marry the masters' daugh- ters. Status differences within the guilds coincided with age differences; the age hierarchy thus reinforced the occupational. Masters normally took one or two journeymen apprentices (who often lived in their homes) and educat- ed them in craft, as well as more broadly. Artisans usually considered themselves an appreciable cut above common manual workers, seeing them- selves as substantial members of their community and as members of an honorable corporate group with proud traditions, a self-image that was often retained even afterjourneymen's incomes fell below those of factory workers. As the guilds declined, masters restricted the numbers of journeymen who might rise to mastership; they took on morejourneymen than before, with the result that the latter were now less likely to live with the master. Having little money, they often roomed with other journeymen and kept each other company after working hours, so that the master's influence on their ideolog- ical and political views was replaced by peer group influences that might support more unconventional views. Soon journeymen were also unable to marry the masters' daughters, and the two groups grew increasingly es- tranged from one another. With their prospects of moving upward sharply curtailed, artisans became more open to new and even radical ideas that they would encounter frequently in Paris and Switzerland during their Wander- jahren. Although artisans were of crucial importance to the 1848 Revolution, hardly all were radicalized, though there was widespread disaffection among them and some turned to socialist views. Many simply wanted restoration of the guild system, limitations on factories, and tariffs on imported manufactured</page><page sequence="4">524 goods. Many others among the journeymen, however, also plainly saw that there could be no returning to the old days of the guilds' glory. Journeymen in particular wanted the guilds changed in various ways, especially to remove hereditary privileges bestowed on masters. It would be clearly wrong to view all artisan demands as either reactionary or narrowly economistic. For they often supported freedom of the press, free education, and wished to expand the powers of parliaments and protect religious liberties. The Artisan Con- gress urged the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848 to support a progressive income tax, a property tax, and to substitute deportation for capital punish- ment - demands that the Parliament found too "radical."6 That artisans' demands were not narrowly economistic was nothing new in 1848. Yet whether the artisans wanted to return to the past and restore the guilds, or whether they wanted to move forward toward a new more egalitarian future, the middle-class liberals dominant at the Frankfurt Parliament rejected their demands. This lost the liberals their most militant supporters and made them vulnerable to the monarchy's counterattack. The artisans, then, were a "social class on the brink of disaster,"7 an uprooted class caught in the middle, as Stadelmann sees it. Artisans increasingly found themselves deprived of their privileged legal and social position, which had made them respected community members and protected them from compe- tition. It was thus not just economic injury but also status threat that led the artisans into opposition, as the "man who gave up his own shop and offered himself for hire lost social status, and surrendered his claim to independen- ce."8 All over Europe, therefore, it was the artisans, not the factory workers, who became the street fighters of the Revolution in the mid-nineteenth century. "Masses of impoverished handicraftsmen roamed through the streets of central Europe, demonstrating, rioting, demanding bread, threat- ening millowners, stoning factories.... They were the shock troops of the spring uprising"9 in 1848. In Paris the revolutionary crowds consisted of many crafts that had been prominent in earlier agitation, from the riots of 1789-93 through abortive risings early during the 1830s and early 1840s..... Traditional leaders of street fighting included construction workers and butchers. Weavers played a major role in the Berlin revolution, which began in a weaving district. Artisans of various sorts spearheaded the rising in Vienna ... craftsmen were prominent in revolutionary agitation in cities like Marseilles and Lyons, while artisan congresses during the German revolution drew support from a wide range of cities.'0 With the entrance of Hesse-Hassel to the Zollverein in 1831, there were riots in Hanover that, some months later, were repeated in the Palatinate. In 1844, 5000 starving Silesian weavers rioted and were crushed - after the riot had spent itself - with bloody vengeance. Thuringen artisans wrecked the nail</page><page sequence="5">525 factory in Schmalkaden; the Rhine cutlers rampaged against the iron foun- daries; the craftsmen of Solingen rioted; teamsters and freightmen rose against the railroads near Kastel in Nassau; Rhine sailors warred on the steamships. When Karl Marx met those he believed to be real workers, they were for the most part artisans who, with their guild traditions, had considerable organi- zational competence. Yet it was precisely because these artisans were the most politically vocal and radicalized workers that Marx acquired an exag- gerated view of the radical potential of the "proletariat" that, in the parlance of his time, included various impoverished groups. In short, when the ordinary language of Marx's time spoke of the "proletariat" and "proletar- ianization," it did not neatly distinguish between uprooted artisans and poor factory workers. Hence the obvious radicalism of the artisans might meto- nymically, but mistakenly, be seen as the radicalism of the whole "proletar- iat," including the factory workers. Marx's view of the revolutionary potential of the proletariat derived from his encounter with radical artisans, and this judgment he then dubiously ex- tended to factory workers - who in Germany had been passive onlookers at the 1848 Revolution. The failure of Marx's prediction of the radicalization of factory workers in the technologically advanced industrial system of Western Europe derived from his mistaken view of the actual locus of militancy in the working class, and from his failure to see that at the center of the revolution were the very artisans whom he stigmatized as conservative or, indeed, as reactionary petty bourgeois. It was only as the artisans were diminished and defeated by the rising industrial system, and only as a factory proletariat became more important, that the European working class ac- commodated itself increasingly to the status quo,12 ignoring the historical destiny Marx had laid on them. Although socialism had little influence among German artisans up to this point, "far more middle-class intellectuals than actual workers were convert- ed."13 Marx and Engels's own movement into communism was part of just that shift among middle-class intellectuals. Indeed, it was precisely the educated, often sons of the rich, teachers, doctors, journalists, lawyers, and intellectuals, who went over to the 1848 Revolution. The radicals among the 1848 revolutionaries were more likely to include independent professions such as the lawyers, doctors, or journalists, as well as some teachers. The center was more likely to be represented by college professors and judicial officials. Whereas one reason for the presence of teachers among the Left parties was that they and "writers are required to cultivate a critical disposi-</page><page sequence="6">526 tion,"'4 there was also straightforward market motives. Just as the disaffec- tion of artisans had been partly fostered by their oversupply relative to market opportunities, a similar excess of educated manpower had also occurred. W. H. Riehl had remarked that "Germany produces a greater intellectual product than she can use and pay."'5 Friedrich Paulsen also spoke of the "chronic overcrowding of the learned professions and their greatly depressed economic conditions" in the nineteenth century, an over- crowding fostered by reform of the university system in Germany and by the state's encouragement of training in professions useful in its bureaucracy. Lenore O'Boyle has contributed importantly in support of the hypothesis that certain professions were overcrowded, perhaps particularly writers. Indeed, one English wit had oberved that they might soon exceed their readers in numbers. At the same time, O'Boyle is also clear that the discon- tent among certain of the professions - lawyers, journalists, teachers - was much like that found among the artisans in being due "more to lack of status than to poverty,"'6 a status threat occasioned by the blockage of their upward mobility. This overproduction of educated labor power helps explain why intellectuals played a leading role in the revolutions of 1848, particularly in Germany, to the point that Namier and others could characterize them as the "revolution of the intellectuals." Thus the 586 members of the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848 included 124 bureaucrats, 104 professors, 100 judicial officials, 95 lawyers, and only 34 landowners and 13 businessmen.'7 The important part played by intellectuals in 1830 and 1848, both in Ger- many and France, was the result in significant measure of the emergence of an intellectual "proletariat." From 1800 to 1830, the absolute and per capita numbers of college and university students grew rapidly in Germany at large and Prussia in particular. Absolute numbers of students increased threefold from 5000 to 15,000, and from 20 to 52.5 per 100,000 inhabitants. Thus the per capita increase of the educated indicates that their growth substantially exceeds what might have been expected to be caused by the growth in population alone.'8 Characterized by a significant status disparity between their public prestige and their incomes, many of these intellectuals were unable to live in a manner traditionally held to be appropriate for them. Lenore O'Boyle's later workl9 has moved toward a systematic comparison between intellectuals in Germany, France, and England, in an attempt to understand why overproduction of educated manpower was greater in some of the countries, and why they were a locus of political instability in some, yet not in all, places. Western Europe was then living during a period of rising expectations, especially among the educated and middle classes, which had begun with the French Revolution. Although education was seen as a major means of acquiring position and wealth, encouraging increased entrance into</page><page sequence="7">527 law, medicine, church, the military, the state bureaucracy, and to the educa- tion systems preparing for them, "opportunities for upward mobility into the educated elite were drastically contracting in the 1840s."20 As a result, "there were 262 candidates for every 100 livings in the church, 265 candidates for every 100 judicial offices and 194 cadidates for every 100 medical appoint- ments."21 The increase in university students during the 1820s was so large as to worry governments. The very reform of the university system and the emergence of a distinct mandarin subculture among academicians nucleated with the idealism of Fichte, Schliermacher, and Schelling, endowed intellec- tuals with a sense of social and national obligation22 that often made them a center for reform programs, even in the bureaucracy. The romantic move- ment to which the youth were especially susceptible encouraged many young intellectuals to resist paternal expectations of business careers, their resist- ance often finding support among sympathetic, increasingly educated moth- ers. Thus the ranks of the educated seeking professional and intellectual careers were burgeoning. It is important to note, however, that industrialization and modernization meant that the overproduction and overcrowding of educated manpower was not found equally among all the professions. It centered among those humanistically educated and in certain professions, but was less evident in the newer technological and scientific occupations. Thus the political aliena- tion attendant on career blockage was not manifested equally in all groups among the educated, but mainly by those in occupations either marginal to the growth of the private industrial sector or excluded from the expanding state bureaucracies. The ability of intellectuals, as distinct from their willingness, to play a decisive role in the German Revolution of 1848 had several influences, among the most important being the development of new mass media, the newspapers, and the corresponding development of a new "profession," journalism. The development of newspapers and journalism provided intel- lectuals with a medium for disseminating their views, for mobilizing publics whom they could lead, and for exerting pressure on political authority, as well as with occupational outlets consistent with their intellectual aspira- tions. Newspapers required relatively little capital to acquire and journalism needed no long specialized preparation to enter. Often enough, and especial- ly in Germany, journalism was an occupation that was widely claimed to be the last refuge of those who had failed in other middle-class or professional careers.23</page><page sequence="8">528 Journalism not only provided a possible source of incomes, however, but also a high degree of visibility and thus prepared writers and editors for political leadership. Whereas this use of journalism as a springboard for political careers was much more institutionalized in France, where young men who sought political futures might often begin as writers and editors, the access of intellectuals to the newspapers, and the newspapers' corresponding need for writers, meant that even in the Germanies intellectuals had more access to publics than they would otherwise have had. The appearance of the intelligentsia on the revolutionary stage in 1848, then, owed much to the prior development of newspapers that intellectuals could use to reach mass au- diences, and that could be launched with relatively modest investments. Thus Marx and Engels very largely started the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in Co- logne with their own out-of-pocket monies.24 Intellectuals' leadership in the German Revolution (as in others) was most important at the parliamentary and other national levels of political action. If the leadership cadres of the German Revolution are studied only through the occupational backgrounds of the Frankfurt Parliament, the role of intellectuals tends to be overestimated whereas that of businessmen is under- estimated. For the latter, although unable to leave their business for any length of time to pursue political leadership, could more readily participate in local government in their own towns, where they could play leading roles. There were, therefore, "important discrepancies between national and local leadership groups."25 Nonetheless, sustained participation in national parlia- ments and in the leadership of national political parties did require busi- nessmen to absent themselves from their businesses. This could be hazardous to new enterprises, and might thus deter businessmen, merchants, shopkeep- ers, and tradesmen from seeking the national leadership of political move- ments. This same impediment, however, did not apply equally to the educat- ed elite. In Germany, "state employees could apply to leave to participate in parliamentary life, lawyers could seek to combine a practice with political activity, and journalists could try to make a living writing about the events in which thay took part,"26 allowing them influence on national politics far in excess of their economic power and wealth. Thus the very kind of occupation in which the educated elite were involved often gave them a motive for dissident participation, and allowed them more time in which they could achieve leadership visibility and effectiveness with national publics. Coupled with their access to the new media and their long-standing prestige in Germany, this made the educated elite there formidable competitors for national political leadership.</page><page sequence="9">529 The 1848 revolutions throughout Europe and especially Germany were the decisive political environment within which Marxism crystallized as a social movement. The revolutions were characterized by a confluence of collective unrest in two critical social strata, artisans and intellectuals, respectively the fighting militants and national leaders of revolutionary change. Often enough, however, artisans saw the educated as class enemies and as hired ideologues for the free trade movement that, together with the factory system, was ruining them. "Handicraftsmen regarded higher education with the same suspicion which they felt toward great wealth," reports Hamerow.27 It was just this widespread tradition of suspicion of the educated that Marx and Engels encountered from sections of the League of the Just, and indeed, from their own Communist League, as well as later in the International Workingmen's Association. Nonetheless, intellectuals' own critical tradi- tions and impaired market situation led some of them to become radicalized and to seek alliance with artisans and their organizations. Both artisans and intellectuals were induced to oppose the status quo by a similar increase in their numbers and by the consequent threat to their status and careers. The similarities between artisans and intellectuals, however, went well beyond this common impairment of their market situation. The two occupations were alike in other ways that made both resentful of threats to their traditional status. They were alike in having important traditions of craftsmanship, even if, in the one case, manual and, in the other, intellectual. They were alike, too, in their common desire to produce objects or services of high quality, and not just those that would sell on the market. Both worked not simply to procure livelihoods. When William Sewell, Jr. describes the artisan ethos, he in effect also describes that of university academicians: "a consistent moral collectivism, an assertion of their own capacity to preserve order and pursue the common good, an insistence on the distinct value and identity of the various trades, and a pride in their work as a contribution to the public welfare." The mechanical and manual trades were also often viewed as "arts" requiring discipline and intelligence, not just physical labor or dexterity and were thus not radically split from the "mental" labor of intellectuals and professionals. Indeed, the term "arts" spread from poetry or architecture to the military and government arts, again serving to bridge both mental and manual labor and to note their common subordination to a system of disciplined production according to rules. There was then an emphasis on certain continuities between artisan and artist, and certain trades and arts. The "liberal arts" were also long organized in a manner similar to the corporatively organized gens de metier and the mechanical arts. As Sewell writes,</page><page sequence="10">530 the universities, the academies, the legal and medical professions, and the royal officers all had organizationsjuridically similar to the corp d'arts et metiers - with their privileges, their internal regulations, and their recognized standing in the state. In the Middle Ages, the similarities between universities and trade corporations were clearly signaled in language: Not only were both headed by "masters," but apprentices in the manual arts were frequently called escolans and journeymen, bacheliers. And as late as the sixteenth century a royal decree banning disorderly banquets could include in a single sentence "all banquets whether for doctorates or other degrees in any faculty, or for masterships of sciences, arts and trades."28 Artisans and intellectuals alike saw themselves as possessing skills that required long and specialized training. Their skills were a center of their selfhood on which they based claims to personal worthiness and community honor. Artisans and educated elites were alike, too, in their membership in ancient and honorable institutions that monitored their work and protected their careers - the guilds and universities. Both these premodern institutions upheld traditions that did not endorse a merely competitive egoism or possessive individualism, but encouraged a measure of responsibility to the large community and a concern for its needs. By reason of their collectivity- responsiveness and their skill commitments, both artisans and intellectuals made claims to independence in the conduct of their work and in the management of their corporate groups and these expectations, when violat- ed, further alienated both groups. Both artisans and intellectuals, then, were alike in being threatened elites during the prerevolutionary era when Marxism was formed. Both felt an alienation from the new industrial capitalism. Fritz Ringer remarks that higher officials, secondary school teachers, judges, lawyers, doctors, and university professors were an elite of the cultivated who "had no more in common with the new commercial and industrial class than they had with the Junkers."29 Much the same could, however, also be said of the many jour- neymen who despised the new factories and factory owners, as well as the merchants who sold their cheaper goods to the ruin of the artisans. That many artisans and intellectuals were then commonly disaffected was in large part because they were then more alike as occupations than they subsequently became. Even their training was then more alike, as certain of the learned professions still trained new recruits by apprenticeships not much different from those used to train artisans. The revolutionary militancy Marx had predicted for the proletariat waned in Western Europe precisely with the decline of the artisans, as the factory system spread; for the artisans had been the most militant wing of the working class. If intellectuals, or sections of intellectuals among the huma- nistically trained, continued to evince discontent with the status quo this was</page><page sequence="11">531 in part because their market and social position was increasingly threatened in the technological and scientific world of advanced industrial capitalism. Humanistic intellectuals continued to be alienated, in short, for much the same reasons that artisans were in the first half of the nineteenth century, for the intellectuals were in part artisans protecting their elite positions from threatening encroachments. Intellectuals, especially humanistic intellectuals and academicians, are, we might say, the last of the artisans; their disaffec- tion remains grounded in much the same social forces that led the artisans to their earlier rebellion.

In like vein, "the Tory Quarterly Review described the 1848 revolution as arising from 'the accidental audacity of a dozen obscure agitators, the spawn of two printing</page><page sequence="12">532 offices...' and ... Lamartine nor anyone else seemed to have thought it odd that a handful of journalists should dethrone a king and themselves decide on a new form of government" (ibid., 301). As for Germany, Metternich himself remarked in 1819 that "All the German Governments have arrived at the conviction that ... the press serves a party antagonistic to all existing governments" (cited ibid., 306). 25.
