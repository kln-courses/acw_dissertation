<plain_text><page sequence="1">Historical Archaeology in Wachovia: Excavating Eighteenth-Century Bethabara and Moravian Pottery. STANLEY SOUTH Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York, NY, 1999. xv + 442 pp., 310 figs., 7 tables, 1 app. $90.00. If one closely peruses book rooms at conferences, publish ers' catalogs, and professional journals, it is apparent that there is little available information about historical archaeol ogy in North Carolina when compared to its neighboring states. This is unfortunate, because there has been a sizable amount of substantive archaeological research on many historic sites across the "Old North State." Much of this information is not readily accessible to the general archaeo logical community or to the public, because it languishes on office shelves and in drawers as "gray literature" (i.e., file reports, CRM reports, and notes from unreported projects). The long-awaited publication of Stanley South's Historical Archaeology in Wachovia-one of the more important pieces of "gray literature" in North Carolina's archaeological past-is a welcomed edition and one that begins to fill this literary void. South's original descriptive report, "Discovery in Wacho via," was completed in 1972, based upon his intermittent archaeological investigations conducted between 1963 and 1968 at the Moravian communities of Bethabara and Salem in Forsyth County. Its publication debut was suspended, however, when John Bivins, Jr.'s now-classic The Moravian Potters in North Carolina (University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1972) was published that same year (pp. ix-x). South made 12 copies of the manuscript and distributed them to various institutions (e.g., Old Salem, the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts, and the North Carolina Division of Archives and History) in 1975. Historical Archaeology in Wachovia is the first publication of the "Discovery in Wachovia" manuscript. It is published by Kluwer Academic/Plenum with only minor revisions, such as the addition of photographic captions, revisions for clarity, and several footnotes to reference archaeological investigations at Bethabara since 1975 (p. vii). South's text is organized in two primary sections. The first section focuses on the history of the Moravians and the archaeological project at Bethabara. The chapters in this section are devoted to summaries of individual architectural features, such as taverns, shops, residences, wells, and the palisade. Each chapter contains brief historical narratives of each feature drawn almost exclusively from Adelaide L. Fries' Records of the Moravians in North Carolina (8 volumes, State Department of Archives and History, Raleigh, 1922). Those accounts are followed by non-technical descriptions of each feature from South's excavations. The majority of the descriptions are architectural, although several chapters also contain humorous anecdotes from the investigations. The last chapters in this section (20, 21, and 22) contain important personal reflections and notes from South on the stabilization of the architectural ruins, the restoration and development of the historic site, and the artifact processing procedures. This section offers the modern archaeologist a wonderful insight into the method, practice, and reporting style of historical archaeology during the mid-to-late 1960s. The second section of Historical Archaeology in Wachovia is devoted to a study of the Moravian potters Gottfried Aust and Rudolph Christ, the archaeological investigations of their pottery shops and kiln waster piles, and descriptions of their locally-made earthenwares. Again drawing heavily from Fries, South presents individual histories of Aust (Chapter 23) and Christ (Chapter 27) and their recorded activities as master potters in the Wachovia community. Chapters devoted to the excavation of Aust's pottery shop, dependencies, and kiln waster piles (24), as well as the Christ-Krause kiln waster piles (28), provide excellent stratigraphic and contextual information for the recovered ceramics. This section also describes the lead-glazed earthenwares produced by Aust and Christ. Based on sherds recovered from his investigations, South classifies 15 ceramic types made by Aust at Bethabara between 1755 and 1771 (pp. 213-215). His criteria for defining a pottery type are based on the different clay pastes (red or white firing) and mineral oxides combined with slip clay to produce colored decorative techniques. South takes painstaking efforts to identify 35 forms produced by Aust. In an excellent diagram (Figure 26.44), he quantifies specific clays, glazes, and decorative motifs used on each form. The information on the ceramics recovered from the Christ-Krause kiln waster pile (Chapter 28) is not as well detailed as the Aust material, nor is it quantified. South's discussions of this material does offer an interesting perspective on the imitative aspects of Moravian ceramic traditions with those of European ceramics, such as "fayance," tortoise-shell ware, creamware, and stonewares (chapters 29-31). Noteworthy are the experiments of potters Rudolph Christ and William Ellis to reproduce local versions of those imported wares. Throughout the discussions on Moravian ceramics in this volume, standardized color charts (e.g., Munsell) for the different clays, glazes, and slip colors would have made this study useful for comparative analyses. The abundant figures complement the text well. South and George Demmy's wonderfully hand-drawn base maps and vessel forms are superb. Those detailed, handcrafted figures represent a lost art in an age dominated by simplistic digital images. The numerous photographs of the archaeological investigations could comprise a separate illustrated history</page><page sequence="2">134 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 35(2) of the project. Many images of the excavations, artifact processing and restoration contain familiar participants in South's investigations during this time, including Demmy, Jewel and David South, Johnny Miller, Garry Wheeler Stone, Brad Rauschenberg, and many of the African-American males who constituted South's excavation and support crew. The photographs of the reconstructed Moravian ceramic forms and kiln furniture are well done but appear only in black and white. The only color images of ceramics appear on the cover, and they are not reproduced in their true colors. Examples reproduced in true color would have enhanced the volume, especially given South's detailed classification scheme for these ceramics. Several of the same photographs appeared in Bivins' work but do not detract from their use in this volume. It is unfortunate that Historical Archaeology in Wachovia was not published at the time of its original writing or revised more to reflect additional recent research on Moravian pottery and its place in North Carolina's craft heritage. It would be a worthwhile exercise to reconsider the ceramic assemblage from these excavations with the past 30 years of research on Moravian and other ceramics produced in North Carolina, like alkaline-glazed stonewares and other backcountry potters who produced slip decorated, lead glazed earthenwares. Additionally, it is notable that some of the information contained within this volume has been previously published, such as the identification of Aust's anthropomorphic smoking pipes in The Florida Anthropologist (18[3]:49-60, 1965). Despite minor qualms, for its discussion on the Bethabara site and the archaeology of the Aust and Christ-Krause shops and kiln waster piles, this volume stands as a valuable companion piece to Bivins' The Moravian Potters in North Carolina. It further details ceramic forms and decorative motifs in what Bivins' classifies as the "early" and "middle" periods of Moravian ceramic production in central North Carolina. As an individual work, it provides information on the archaeological investigations at Bethabara and the context of the excavated Moravian ceramics more accessible to the archaeology community, ceramic researchers, and the general public. South's text is equally accessible to all of those groups, but at $90.00 it is overpriced for the public. Only time and future publications will judge the acceptance of South's ceramic types by scholars and ceramic researchers. Kluwer Academic/Plenum's issue of South's descriptive publication coincides, perhaps unintentionally, with the resumption of large-scale archaeological investigations at Bethabara by The Archeology Laboratories of Wake Forest University. Historical Archaeology in Wachovia and the original work at Bethabara it represents stand as testament to the dedicated and prolific Stanley South, whose outstanding contributions to historical archaeology in North Carolina during the 1950s and 1960s have now begun to be fully recognized and appreciated.
