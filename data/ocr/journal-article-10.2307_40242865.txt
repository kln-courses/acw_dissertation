<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jane Hirshfield Two Secrets Xora while now I've been thinking about how the outer world and inner experience collaborate, and trying to explore the ways in which they come together in the making of meaning and the making of poems. One of the secrets, I think, is held in the etymology of the word "idea," which comes from a Greek verb that means "to see" - a connection also visible in the way that in English we use the phrase "I see" to mean "I understand." It's important, though, to get the direction right - it is seeing (and tasting, smell- ing, touching, hearing) that leads to understanding, not vice versa. The world was here before we were, we are inductive before we are deductive, and the means of poetry from its earliest beginnings - image, metaphor, story - confirm this. Inner ex- perience, when it forms itself into language, is constructed out of the material of the outer: for Dickinson, sorrow came in the form of slanted winter light that lies heavy within us, "like the weight / Of cathedral tunes"; joy, Blake tells us, is a thing to be kissed as it flies. To communicate inner feelings we turn, are forced to turn, to the shared and communal experience of the world outside the self - so that even when Wallace Stevens wants to say something fundamentally conceptual and abstract, he knows, because he is a poet, that the statement will be most effective if it is embodied. He writes, a little paradoxically perhaps, 'There is no wing like meaning." And it is important, too, to remember that to see things with a precise and unbounded eye is also to allow them, as well as ourselves, to look back. Another version of this idea is found in the opening of the earliest piece of critical writing in Japanese literature, the poet Ki no Tsurayuki's preface to the Kokinshu, the poetry anthology he assembled for the Emperor in the year 905. He wrote: The poetry of Japan has its seeds in the human heart and mind and grows into the myriad leaves of words. Because people experience many different phenomena in this world, they ex- press that which they think and feel in their hearts in terms of all that they see and hear. A nightingale singing among the blossoms, the voice of a pond-dwelling frog - listening to these, what living being would not respond with his own poem? It is poetry that effortlessly moves the heavens and the earth, awakens the world of invisible spirits to deep feeling, makes tender the relationship between men and women, and consoles the hearts of fierce warriors. It's easy to dismiss Tsurayuki's first sentence as simply an obvious (and to us by now quite clichéd) metaphor, just a bit of decorative speaking. But it's worth noticing Jane Hirshfield 19</page><page sequence="2">that in it he is not only offering one of the central ideas but also enacting for us one of the core strategies of Japanese poetry, the tying together of inner meaning and outer experience in order to make something that can't quite be otherwise said. What would the sentence be without its image? "Japanese poetry begins in the human heart and mind and becomes - " Here we're forced to stop: not only are we already bored, but what abstraction could translate rightly the sense of those "myriad leaves of words", a green canopy of meaning that is both elusive and clear, both finely detailed and sweeping? That our heart's language is leafy and alive, part of the wide world we are born into, is something we cannot be told except through the enactment of met- aphor. This phrase - "words' leaves," koto no ha - appears throughout Japanese poetry, and each time we meet it, it reminds us that the human tongue and nature's are thoroughly entangled. There are of course fully realized poems in which no glimpse of the natural world appears. Think of Catullus's famous "odi et amo": I hate and I love. Ask, if you want, why this is so - I can't say. But I feel it and I am in torment.1 There is the 9th-century Japanese poet Ono no Komachi's: I know it must be this way in the waking world, but how cruel - even in my dreams, we hide from others' eyes. And: Did he appear because I was thinking of him? If only I'd known I was dreaming, I'd never have wakened. There is Bertolt Brecht^ "I, The Survivor": I know of course: it's simply luck That I've survived so many friends. But last night in a dream I heard those friends say of me: 'Survival of the fittest5 And I hated myself. (tr. by John Willet) Each of these poems succeeds in moving us by means of its internal tensions - one of the strong devices for aliveness in poetry. Part of the tension is in the given con- 2O NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">trasts, but part is also in the fact that they speak of what is unnamable except by circling it. In these poems of the direct-speaking mind, the sense-realm is the kines- thetic: the muscle-awareness every animal possesses, the inward consciousness and paths of communication that let a tree grow into its place in perfectly realized balance, taking into account the subterranean stone that holds the roots in place, the course of the midsummer sun, the weight of snow or of apples - but taking them into ac- count by the experience of its own leaning. Still, such poems are rare: most will have some recourse to the outer world in order to make their saying possible. And for good reason: there is something mysteriously touching in even the simple details of an anonymous Egyptian woman's love poem, from around 1500 b.c.e.: I find my love fishing His feet in the shallows. We have breakfast together And drink beer. I offer him the magic of my thighs He is caught in the spell. (tr. by Ezra Pound and Noel Stock) It's hard to pin down what makes this poem so wonderful, but we know that a good part of it is in the earthy details: the cool water washing the feet of the lover, the beer. We are entranced into this relationship by sensuous detail, just as the lover himself is entranced. In much the same way, Aphrodite is beckoned by means of sensual beauty to come to the sacred grove where Sappho waited in the seventh cen- tury b.c.e. : Leave Crete, Aphrodite, and come to this sacred place encircled by apple trees, fragrant with offered smoke. Here, cold springs sing softly amid the branches; the ground is shady with roses; from trembling young leaves, a deep drowsiness pours. In the meadow, horses are cropping the wildflowers of spring, scented fennel blows on the breeze. Jane Hirshfield 21</page><page sequence="4">In this place, Lady of Cyprus, pour the nectar that honors you into our cups, gold, and raised up for drinking. In both poems, nature is simply being nature. The horses grazing on wildflowers are simply horses grazing on wildflowers, the murmur of water is only the murmur of water; they communicate only their own existence. Yet something in us finds these things irresistible, they are part of the seduction of Being itself. And so when we write the poetry of courtship, whether what we court is a human lover or the sacred Other, it is no surprise that we so often make for the beloved a desirable landscape with our words: intimacy occurs not only in our own bodies, but also within the large body of earth. While in these first examples nature simply is, in many poems the imagery of earth is called upon in ways that fall into one of three possible stances: In the first stance, the poet uses the natural world to extend his or her own voice and ways of saying - and so, nature is present, but the relationship is a kind of monologue, with the human-centered consciousness dominating. In the second stance, the poet and the natural world stand face to face in mutual regard, and out of that meeting the poet sees what thoughts and feelings arise - this makes for a kind of dialogue, in which the wider earth is not turned into the self, but is in equal relationship with it. The third possibility, perhaps an unrealizable ideal, is for the poem to become a voice for the world, and so permit the world of objects and nature to speak through us - here the poet's stance is a kind of active listening to the non-human other, a listening that is accomplished through a deep and long-practiced attention, and also through using language itself as an organ of perception. A shorthand description for the three stances might be to say they are the subjective mode, the reflective mode, and the objective. In thinking about them, it's easy for me to fall into the idea that they form a hierarchy - to think that the subjective voice is necessarily self-centered and immature, the voice of reflection a little wiser, and the objective voice attainable only by a thoroughly ripened consciousness, but Fm not sure that it's so useful to judge them in this way. I want more, in examining these three kinds of writing through and with nature, to see in each of them what true work is being done. I'll begin, though, with a look at the danger of the first, subjective, mode of writing. A good example can be found in the kind of English Romantic poetry that still throws a sentimental fog over most people's idea of what poetry is. Read the opening of Shelley's 'The Cloud," for instance, and see if it doesn't make you feel, to put it mildly, a certain embarrassment: "I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers, From the seas and the streams; I bear light shade for the leaves when laid In their noonday dreams. 22 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">From my wings are shaken the dews that waken The sweet buds every one, When rocked to rest on their mother's breast, As she dances about the sun . . ." The poem, I should add, docs not improve. It seems almost a sin of consciousness, this trivialization and anthropomorphism; even the rhythms lack depth. "To A Sky- lark" ["Hail to thec, Blithe spirit . . ."], written the same year, has some of the same problems, but is still somewhat readable, in a way that "The Cloud" is not. Part of the reason, I think, is because "To A Skylark," unlike "The Cloud," is a poem of the second stance: the poet at least is himself, observing and responding, and not trying to pretend to be nature, and so using it in order to convey an utterly human (and to my ear, utterly false) state of consciousness. One result is that in "To A Skylark" a certain humility crops up almost in spite of itself: "What thou art we know not," the speaker admits, and the poem proceeds in part by questions rather than statements. I still cannot love the poem, most fundamentally because I think Shelley's desire for a poetry of blitheness, for a music that is without shadow, shows a failure of nerve that permeates many, though not all, of his poems. There is also the problem of grandi- osity. But the poem at least ends with the poet listening, which seems to me a pretty good position for a poet to be in. There are better instances, though, of poems in which subjective meaning inhabits the realm of nature. Here is a poem by Czeslaw Milosz in which it is clear that the tree (which probably also genuinely exists in the outer world) primarily stands for the self: Window I looked out the window at dawn and saw a young apple tree translucent in brightness. And when I looked out at dawn once again, an apple tree laden with fruit stood there. Many years had probably gone by but I remember nothing of what happened in my sleep. (tr. by Czeslaw Milosz and Lillian Vallée) Classical Chinese and Japanese poetry is one good place to turn for works in which the outer world and human meaning interpenetrate without dishonoring either. Here is another example of the subjective mode at work, in a small poem by Izumi Shikibu, the foremost woman poet of Japanese literature, who wrote around the year iooo: Undisturbed, my garden fills with summer's growth - How I wish for one who would push the deep grass aside. Again, the vegetable life in this poem is doubtless first of all real, but in this poem it also carries a human meaning - the untrimmed garden shows us the poet's neglected Jane Hirshfield 23</page><page sequence="6">circumstances, and in a subtle way also her state of mind. There is another possible reading too - the deep grass she wishes were pushed aside can have a rather specific erotic meaning. This very multiplicity of readings is one reason that the poem works. The poet has gone into nature for her speaking, and the result is that the poem, like nature itself, can face many directions at the same time. One of the more radical examples in contemporary American poetry of a poet in- fusing nature with human subjectivity is Louise Gluck's most recent book, The Wild Iris. It is a work of ventriloquism, with poems that speak in three types of voices: the voice of a somewhat distant creator, the voice of the human, and, in the largest num- ber of poems, the voice of such things as the hawthorn tree of her garden, the various lilies, snowdrops, violets, iris, trillium, the ineradicable witchgrass. Every part of this chorus is clearly and unabashedly part of Gluck herself, reaching into the Other in order to reach into the self in the broadest possible way and from the broadest possible perspective, and the act of personification is made so boldly that there is no question of the distortion of nature we feel in Shelley; this is something else entirely. Here is «Witchgrass": Something comes into the world unwelcome calling disorder, disorder - If you hate me so much don't bother to give me a name: do you need one more slur in your language, another way to blame one tribe for everything - as we both know, if you worship one god, you only need one enemy - Fm not the enemy. Only a ruse to ignore what you see happening right here in this bed, a little paradigm of failure. One of your precious flowers dies here almost every day and you can't rest until you attack the cause, meaning whatever is left, whatever happens to be sturdier than your personal passion - 24 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="7">It was not meant to last forever in the real world. But why admit that, when you can go on doing what you always do, mourning and laying blame, always the two together. I don't need your praise to survive. I was here first, before you were here, before you ever planted a garden. And I'll be here when only the sun and moon are left, and the sea, and the wide field. I will constitute the field. Even though most of the thinking of this poem is blatantly "human," it's worth noticing how much energy comes into it from its having passed through the imagined consciousness of the witchgrass. Especially the last line has the authority of the wild and the authentically stunning, chilling non-negotiability of the wild. (Last spring, on a trip to Alaska, I encountered an example of what I mean by the wild's "non- negotiability" - I was told that even though reindeer and caribou arc genetically quite similar, if you try to put a halter a caribou, or treat it as you would the more domes- ticated animal, it will quickly die of stress.) It's also worth noticing that there is noth- ing immature about the subjectivity of Gluck's poem: its strategy is an essential part of finding out how much we can know. This is one of the central reasons poets have always turned to animal and mineral being to express their own: to find in that store- house of particularity and wisdom a larger possibility of understanding. There is one more use of the subjective mode I should mention, the symbolic or allegorical poem. A good shorter example is one of Blake's Songs of Experience, "The Sick Rose," in which nature seems hardly nature at all: O rose, thou art sick! The invisible worm That flies in the night, In the howling storm, Has found out thy bed Of crimson joy, And his dark secret love Does thy life destroy. But even in a poem whose rose lives in no earthly garden and whose worm is no ordinary gardener's nemesis, we can recognize at once what allegiance to the actual caused Blake to enlist them in his diagnosis of the human soul. The second stance, the reflective, is the most common by far in contemporary poems. In these poems, the poet looks at the world with a clear and steady and ques- Jane Hirsh field 25</page><page sequence="8">tioning eye, neither imposing him or herself upon it nor disappearing into it, and out of that meeting something happens, something is learned. A poem that is at one level about the difference between the first stance and the second is Zbigniew Herbert's "Pebble": The pebble is a perfect creature equal to itself mindful of its limits filled exactly with a pebbly meaning with a scent which does not remind one of anything does not frighten anything away does not arouse desire its ardour and coldness are just and full of dignity I feel a heavy remorse when I hold it in my hand and its noble body is permeated by false warmth - Pebbles cannot be tamed to the end they will look at us with a calm and very clear eye (tr. by Czcslaw Milosz and Peter Dale Scott) Herbert gives the pebble human qualities when he speaks in terms of its ardour and coldness, dignity, mindfulness, and he also tells us that it has none, when he speaks of his regret at allowing the false warmth of his hand to permeate its "noble body." The point of the poem (which is also a poem of political resistance) is that the pebble remains itself no matter what is done to it, even by the poet himself. Beyond corruption, beyond whatever human meaning we attribute to it, this envoy of the objective is one thing we can measure ourselves by safely. Another kind of reflective poem is one in which the poet observes some outer natural phenomenon and is reminded of something from his or her own life. Here is an example, again by Izumi Shikibu: Last year's fragile, vanished snow is falling now again - if only seeing you could be like this. 26 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="9">The poem, a poem of mourning, has its heart in the meeting of inner and outer circumstances. The falling snow returns, but her dead lover cannot, and the poet's grief infuses and is infused by the coldness and whiteness that falls everywhere, taking the whole landscape for itself, beyond human will or wishes. The difference between our realm and nature's, even though the one may remind us of the other, is itself the source of the poem's tension and of its poignancy. Mary Oliver is a poet who in poem after poem goes out in close observation of the natural and draws from it, as a kingfisher draws a fish from the water, some bit of soul nourishment and increase of being, some greater knowledge and acceptance of the world as it is. In her work the self is usually visible - thinking, walking, watching. Herons in Winter in the Frozen Marsh All winter two blue herons hunkered in the frozen marsh, like two columns of blue smoke. What they ate I can't imagine, unless it was the small laces of snow that settled in the ruckus of the cattails, or the glazed windows of ice under the tired pitchforks of their feet - so the answer is they ate nothing, and nothing good could come of that. They were mired in nature, and starving. Still, every morning they shrugged the rime from their shoulders, and all day they stood to attention in the stubbled desolation. I was filled with admiration, sympathy, and, of course, empathy. It called for a miracle. Finally the marsh softened, and their wings cranked open revealing the old blue light, Jane Hirshfield 27</page><page sequence="10">so that I thought: how could this possibly be the blunt, dark finish? First one, then the other, vanished into the ditches and upheavals. All spring, I watched the rising blue-green grass, above its gleaming and substantial shadows, toss in the breeze, like wings. This is another wonderfully tactfiil poem about death, as well as one that is filled with descriptions of the natural using human terms (a mirror of the larger procedure) that strike us as being at the same time both surprising and perfect - "the ruckus of cattails," the herons seen as "columns of smoke," that the wings "cranked open." Between the two motions, outer and inner are knitted deeply together. A section of Virgil's Georgia, in a sinuous free- verse translation by David Slavitt, asks an essential question for a poem of the second stance's reflective mode: Whose reality arc we being given? The Gravid Mares The gravid mares graze out their months in gentle stateliness, freed from all human burdens by their own, kept close in care, pastured in shady fields where quiet rivers lap the quieter moss that lines their banks. The mares go out at dawn and again at dusk (avoiding the gadflies' noon); you see them taking shape in the morning mist or burnished by the golden light of sunset . . . Tricks of the light? But we must believe our eyes even at miracles. Huge and yet delicate, they stalk their time, the creatures of a dream (The gods'? Ours? Their own?). And wake. And foal. The marvel of it fades - all marvels do - and feeling our way, our confidence again, we lapse into routines, as the gods do, too, of the business of life. For a last example of a poem of the second stance, here is one that moves in its thinking towards the third - Denise Levertov's "Brother Ivy": 28 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="11">Between road and sidewalk, the broadleafed ivy, unloved, dusty, littered, sanctuary of rats, gets on with its life. New leaves shine gaily among dogged older ones that have lost their polish. It does not require appreciation. The foliage conceals a brown tangle of stems thick as a mangrove swamp; the roots are spread tenaciously. Unwatered throughout the long droughts, it simply grips the dry ground by the scruff of the neck. I am not its steward. If we are siblings, and I my brother's keeper therefore, the relationship is reciprocal. The ivy meets its obligation by pure undoubtable being. A poetry of pure undoubtable being . . . impossible, surely: the earth does not speak in our language. And yet certain poems approach that place, and many point toward it. Robinson Jeffers pointed over and over, but could not bear to relinquish his moral connection with the humanity he continually damned for its self-centered- ness. (He says this explicitly in a late lyric, "On An Anthology of Chinese Poetry.") Czcslaw Milosz points, too, in his wonderful Une, "Great was that chase with the hounds for the unattainable meaning of the world." It is not only a beautiful Une, but an essential one, in that it knows that the chase for deep meaning is made in the company of hounds, of life-energies other than our own. The thirteenth-century Japanese Zen master, Eihei Dôgen put it this way, in a formulation much quoted: "To study the Tao is to study the self, to study the self is to forget the self, to forget the self is to awaken into the ten thousand things." There are no shortcuts - you cannot leap beyond human consciousness without going through it, that was Shelley's mistake in 'The Cloud" - but if you gaze deeply enough into being, Dôgen says, eventually you will awaken into the company of everything. The thought goes back to the Buddha, who stated at the moment of his enlighten- ment (which took place, significantly, outside, under a fig tree, when he saw the morning star), "Now everything and I awaken." Seeing things clearly is not a solitary business, it seems, but one of a companionship so intimate that it becomes something else. This thought is not found only in Eastern traditions - it is echoed too by Meister Eckhart, who wrote 'The more deeply we are our true selves, the less self is in us." What kinds of poems do we find in this third stance? Surprisingly, the first answer seems to be, in the strictest sense, very few. What is a commonplace in the visual arts - landscape paintings, animal paintings, still lives of vegetables or flowers or bowls of fruit - is rarely seen in poetry, where the self seems to almost insist on in- serting its presence. There are of course many poems that have in them passages of Jane Hirshfield 29</page><page sequence="12">pure description, but the poem which is set entirely within a non-human context is comparatively rare. Perhaps this is not so surprising after all, when we consider the difference in the two media: paint's first home is the sensory outer, but words' home is the human mind and heart. Nonetheless, expressing the world beyond the self is something that poets, in various ways, have tried to do. The tradition in which this ideal is most apparent is that of Buddhist and Taoist influenced Chinese and Japanese poetry, and it was especially an explicit goal for writers of haiku - not all haiku, but many. Here is a famous example by the seventeenth-century Japanese poet, Bashô; it is the poem said to mark his coming into maturity as a writer: On a withered branch one perching crow: autumn nightfall. And two others of his as well: The sea grows dark. Faint calls of passing ducks are white. Lightning - into its darkness, a night heron calls. And two more by the nineteenth century poet Buson: Spring rain: the belly of the frog is not wet. Evening wind - the water slaps the blue herons legs. Each of these poems has the quality of sheer observation. You can try to turn them into pieces about human situations or consciousness, but the resulting interpretation will be a weaker poem than the one the poet wrote: a seventeen syllable presentation of what isy in its pure is-ness. Still, the goal may not be objectivity at all. Bashô taught his poetry students, cTo learn about the pine tree go to the pine tree," but he also taught that "the trouble with most poems is that they are either subjective or objective." In various places throughout history, in aboriginal cultures for example, or in the work of certain mys- tics, a poetry of wholeness has appeared in which these terms become irrelevant. It's only common sense - take away a narrow subjectivity, and you will also take away objectivity: there is no need to exclude the human self when the self is not selfish. It becomes simply one more aspect of the whole. 3O NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="13">An example of this kind of equality between self and other is this poem by Ryôkan, an 18th-century Zen priest: From today the nights turn colder - I saw my tattered robe, the autumn insects cry. (tr. by John Stevens) Ryôkan isn't the center of this poem and neither are the crickets: both are respond- ing according to their particular natures to the oncoming season of cold. Other poems explicitly describe this coming into oneness of subjective and objec- tive. Here is a poem by the Pang Dynasty poet Li Po; as in Ryôkan's poem, there is a self present, but here that self disappears into the wholly non-subjective by the poem's end. The effect is perhaps something like those huge Chinese mountain land- scapes in which, if you look carefully, you can find the tiny figures of two monks making their way. I know that other people sometimes suggest that these figures are included so that the viewer will have a point of identification, but I have another theory - that it seems we need first to include our self-interest as humans before we can pass freely beyond it into the limitless ridges and valleys themselves. I Make My Home in the Mountains You ask why I live in the mountain forest, and I smile, and am silent, and even my soul remains quiet: it lives in the other world which no one owns. The peach trees blossom. The water flows. (tr. by Sam Hamill) Another poem of this kind was written as a letter by the 8th-century poet Wang Wei: You Asked About My Life. I Send You, Pei Di, These Lines A wide icy river floats to far uncertainty. The autumn rain is eternal in the mist. You ask me about Deep South Mountain. My heart knows it is beyond white clouds. (tr. by Tony Barnstone, Willis Barnstone, and Xu Haixin) A final example of a poem beyond subjective and objective is a poem by Dôgen (the Zen master quoted above) that is a seamless portrait of inner and outer. Without the title or any knowledge of the imagery of Buddhist poetry, it might be possible to read the poem only in terms of its outer image, and that would be a fine and complete poem, but it is both that and something else: Jane Hirshfield 31</page><page sequence="14">Poem on the Treasury of the Clear-seeing Eye Unmoored in midnight water, no waves, no wind, the empty boat is flooded with moonlight. The boat is a boat, the boat is the self after realization, empty of all concepts; the moonlight is moonlight, spilling over everything, the moonlight is Buddhist enlight- enment. There is no difference any longer between an ordinary rowboat and the poet's mind. In this state of unmooredness, it is not necessary to pin things down as one or the other, both, neither: they are simply there to be stepped into along with Dôgen, and rowed away. Even in the Western tradition it is possible to find poems with objective hearts. There is of course Rilke's 'The Panther," there is the work of William Carlos Williams and others who came to the Japanese-influenced theories of imagism, there is the outward-turned eye of Lawrence's "Birds, Beasts, and Flowers." But looking in less likely places we can find, for instance, that Emily Dickinson, that dear-eyed observer, could do it too: "A bird came down the walk," for example, has the poet present as a figure, but the eye of the poem is firmly upon the bird's being, not her own. No human point is made by this poem's conclusion: And he unrolled his feathers And rowed him sorter home - Than Oars divide the Ocean, Too silver for a seam - Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon Leap, plashless as they swim. I begin to notice something. It must be that there is something about birds - the way we are always aware that their presence among us might be withdrawn at any moment, the way part of us follows them into the distance and disappears - that makes them keep cropping up in the issues we've been looking at here. Wallace Stevens's 'Thirteen Ways of Looking At A Blackbird" is a poem as much about these questions as a poem can be. Part I is a simple, objective presentation, a description much like a haiku. The reader can draw his or her own interpretation - the eye of the blackbird might be consciousness, some subliminal part of us registers. Certainly it is the thing we identify with amid the snow-covered landscape, infinite in its twenty mountains - a number that Stevens uses in the way that the Chinese use the number ten thousand, to say infinite. But because the poem is new at this point, the blackbird is mostly pure blackbird. We are satisfied to let it be a blackbird. In Part II, the self enters in: "I was of three minds . . ." Then, we are immediately returned to the world of the external: "... Like a tree / in which there are three blackbirds." We may notice that it is a relief to find ourselves back there, roosting in the outer: the conflict of being in three minds in the human realm pressures us toward achieving some resolution. This is the point of Festinger's psychological theory of 32 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="15">cognitive dissonance, which says that the mind in which two realities conflict will sacrifice one or the other in order to maintain consistency and coherence. Keats, of course, in his definition of the great poet as one who is able to maintain a "negative capability" and dwell comfortably in mystery, may have been the first to point out explicitly that poetry requires exactly such a non-simplified, complex relationship to truth in order to say anything meaningful and beautiful. The stanza shows us Keats's way out of Festinger's dilemma. The three blackbirds are not in conflict, but in easy companionship with the tree that holds them, and if we can enter the mind of tree- ness, we can hold multiplicity without imposing ranking or judgment. Part III - "The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. / It was a small part of the pantomime." Pantomime is a very Stevensish word for our larger situation. It is also a very human conception. Something is being proposed about the relationship of natural and human, and, like the blackbird itself perhaps, I am made slightly uneasy by the perspective. Part IV - "A man and a woman / Are one. / A man and a woman and a blackbird / Are one." In a lecture on a text called the Sandokai ("The Meeting of the Many and the One"), the Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki Roshi talks about the way that only things recognized as existing fully within their separateness can be fully recognized as equal in the absolute sense of the One. Letting the blackbird into the equation, it seems to me, lets the man and woman be unmerged as well as merged. Part V - "I do not know which to prefer, / The beauty of inflections / Or the beauty of innuendoes, / The blackbird whistling / Or just after." The point of view of the self reenters the poem in a stanza about aesthetics: Is the thing itself, or our unspoken response to it, the point? Here, the blackbird appears predominantly as symbol, as illustration. But the bird which has been established for us by the preceding stanzas is still present, cleaning its glossy feathers offstage, perhaps, while it waits to return. Part VI - "Icicles filled the long window / With barbaric glass. / The shadow of the blackbird / Crossed it, to and fro. / The mood / Traced in the shadow / An indeci- pherable cause." Again we are in the realm of blackbird as symbol. The window is our own vision, distorted by the projections of a coldness born, perhaps, of the knowledge of death; the true blackbird is outside it and beyond reach, crossing back and forth, known here only by inference and through the lens of our own concerns. Part VII - "O thin men of Haddam, / Why do you imagine golden birds? / Do you not see how the blackbird / Walks around the feet / Of the women about you?" This, too, is a stanza about the relationship between the actual and the productions of human mind. The common blackbird, the rejected shadow-side that is ordinary life, does not require glamour or even flight to dwell comfortably with the women - who are, no doubt, also being neglected in the quest for "golden birds." Part VIII - "I know noble accents / And lucid, inescapable rhythms; / But I know, too, / That the blackbird is involved / In what I know." This continues the thinking of Part VII - neither art nor our lives are complete or even possible without the living blackbird. Part IX - "When the blackbird flew out of sight, / It marked the edge / Of one of many circles." It may be only one of many circles, but we suspect it is rather an essential one - the circle of what can be known. Jane Hirshfield 33</page><page sequence="16">Part X - "At the sight of blackbirds / Flying in a green light, / Even the bawds of euphony / Would cry out sharply." The blackbird that has just left the poem is return- ing, made rich and multiple by its having passed into the wholly unconscious, so that now it comes in a flock in the strange light - the green light, perhaps, that sometimes flashes up like an other-worldly gift at sunset, or the everything-is-possible light of the surreal imagination. The sight is overwhelming even to those who think they may make or understand beauty - or worse yet, own it. What comes to us unowned, from outside the self, is greater than anything we may think we can control, and startles us out of our intellectual confidence into the pure, unthinking acknowledgement of sen- sual beauty. Part XI - "He rode over Connecticut / in a glass coach. / Once, a fear pierced him, / In that he mistook / The shadow of his equipage / For blackbirds." I don't know how other people interpret this stanza, but I take it as a portrait, perhaps a slightly wry self-portrait, of hubris: of a person who, in his highly breakable and utterly transpar- ent self-definition as monarch of artifice, can be threatened even by a mistaken hint of the untamable real. Part XII - 'The river is moving. / The blackbird must be flying." Again at this mo- ment my experience as reader is one of a great relief: things have been returned to their true relationship as thought returns to the wholly external for its statement. When the river is able to do what rivers do, we can surmise that the blackbird is also following its blackbird nature freely. The stanza has the quality of a verse from the I Ching\ utterly sure of a Tao grounded in nature. Part XIII - "It was evening all afternoon. / It was snowing / And it was going to snow. / The blackbird sat / In the cedar-limbs." Something mysterious is going on in this stanza, in the way that human consciousness is present without declaring itself. It has to do with the categorization of the light in human terms, "evening all after- noon," and with the time-consciousness also evident in "it was snowing and it was going to snow." For me, at least, the blackbird is now proximate, the cedar tree per- haps near to the unmentioned house where human consciousness lives, observing not with the uneasiness of Part VFs icicle-filled window but with the acceptance and unity of a being who is not trying to exclude, include, or make anything happen. This blackbird is much like the one at the poem's beginning, the one moving thing its eye (its "I") in Part I, but the journey of the poem has also transformed it and brought it closer, just as the many different stanza strategies (of objective, subjective, speculative, descriptive, imaginative, and narrative mind) have culminated in the quietly intimate, deeply physical observation and speaking of the final part. Something is present, something is watching. It has neither blessed us nor judged us, but it is part of what we know. That is enough. Stevens wrote in one of his early journals: "I thought, on the train, how utterly we have forsaken the Earth, in the sense of excluding it from our thoughts. There are but few who consider its physical hugeness, its rough enormity. It is still a disparate mon- strosity, full of solitudes + barrens + wilds. It still dwarfs + terrifies + crushes. The rivers still roar, the mountains still crash, the winds still shatter. Man is an affair of cities. His gardens + orchards + fields are mere scrapings. Somehow, however, he 34 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="17">has managed to shut out the face of the giant from his windows. But the giant is there, nevertheless . . ." The blackbird beyond the window, in the mountains, in the psyche, in the snowy tree, is surely one face of the giant, claiming our attention. There is one final work I'd like to refer to in thinking about this question of inner and outer in the making of art. The Tempesfs ending is about forgiveness, but it is also about the setting right of one man's relationship to nature. It was the desire for an unnatural enchantment that cost Prospero his dukedom in the first place, and throughout the long years of his maturation he has maintained without self-doubt his dominance over Caliban, the spirit of all things earthy and subterranean, whose work sustains the daily and animal life (his first words, after all, are about bringing wood to heat the cave) and over Ariel, spirit of air and aesthetic beauty. In the speech that ends with Prospero's vow to drown his book, you can feel the old thrill, for him, in his about- to-be-forsaken mastery over sea and wind and trees: such a relationship to nature is endlessly tempting. But if Prospero is to step into his proper powers and appropriate responsibilities, he must first give up an ultimately misguided relationship to the natural world by setting its spirits free. Prospero cannot be Prospero until Ariel is Ariel and Caliban is Caliban, undeflected by human consciousness and desires. Then, when in the epilogue he says, "what strength I have's mine own," we recognize the great Tightness in the fact that, in assuming power as a duke, Prospero has also assumed vulnerability. He is now at the mercy of the community at large - human, animal, mineral, spiritual - and must humbly ask its assistance to continue on his path. This, I think, is the other secret. We begin to write by seeing, and continue to write by seeing more and more clearly, but the other part of writing good poems is found in relinquishing more and more of ourselves to more and more of the world. I do not know any prescription for doing this. I wish I did. I think it may be that the world does it for us, and to us, however hard we struggle and resist. Time in its joy and grief and boredom and richness instructs us as we pass from the infant's experience of the world as entirely self toward the experience of ripeness that we find fulfilled, rarely, in the late work of a few great writers and artists. We hear over and over again in such pieces the murmur, simply, of "Look: marvelous, marvelous." And then even that is swallowed up in the larger chorus. NOTES i.
