<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERPRETATIONS OF PRE-HISPANIC RITUAL VIOLENCE AT TUCUME, PERU, FROM CUT MARK ANALYSIS J. Maria Toyne Archaeological residues of ritual are often ephemeral, and reconstructing the dynamics of performed actions that create deposits can be difficult. Rituals associated with the dead are common across many cultures since all human groups have specific means of disposing of corpses. Evidence of peri- and postmortem manipulation of human remains, such as cutting, dismemberment, or disarticulation can provide details of the sequence of actions performed related to the circumstances surrounding death and the possible social meaning of those behaviors. Cut marks observed on the upper chest and throat of 93 percent of 117 children and men found interred at the Temple of the Sacred Stone at Tucume, Peru are consistent with three symbolic behaviors: cutting the throat, opening the chest cavity, and decapitation. This patterning of skeletal trauma demonstrates that a highly elaborate series of violent ritual behaviors was carried out on a regular basis at this location, beginning in the Late Intermediate Period (~A.D. 1100) through to the end of the Late Horizon Inca occupation of the site around A.D. 1532. The recent finds of bioarchaeological evidence of ritual violence across the Andes suggests that, although rare, these mortuary remains provide important clues to the elaborate nature of ritual behaviors at different sites. Los contextos de sacrificios humanos son poco frecuentes en la arqueologfa, y generalmente es dificil interpretar las acciones rituales que los originaron. La manipulaciön peri y postmortem de estos restos humanos nos proporciona information refer ente a complejas ceremonias y su significado social. Las hue lias de corte observadas en la parte superior del pecho y gar ganta en el 93 por ciento de los 117 nihos y hombres jövenes, hallados en el Templo de la Piedra Sagrada en Tucume, Peru, son consistentes con tres comportamientos simbölicos: degollamiento, apertura de la cavidad toraxica y decapitacion. Este patron de trauma öseo demuestra que una serie elaborada de violentas acciones rituales fue llevada a cabo regularmente en este lugar, empezando en el Periodo Intermedio Tardio (ca. 1100 d.C.) hasta el final de la ocupaciön Inca en el sitio, hacia el Horizonte Tardio alrededor de 1532 d.C. Human sacrifice is a powerful tool. It demonstrates an individual's or collec tive's control over life and death and often serves to connect these biological realities in a per petuate cycle related to social renewal (Moore 2004; Swenson 2003). The long history of ritual ized violence in the archaeological record in the South American Andes demonstrates that pre-His panic societies were cognizant of this potential. Archaeologically, conclusive evidence of sacri ficial or ritually motivated deaths is rarely encoun tered. In the Andes, there is an ancient tradition of iconographic representations of decapitator deities holding blades and disembodied heads (Carmichael 1995; Cordy-Collins 1992). Frequently, human burials or isolated remains not found in cemeteries are interpreted as sacrificial offerings, either to ded icate architecture or to accompany deceased indi viduals (Eeckhout and Owens 2008; Gaither et al. 2008; Verano 1995). Often these remains lack clear evidence that they were killed or treated differently than other dead members of the community, except for their distinctive burial location. In the early his toric sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, written documents describe elaborate prehispanic Inca rit uals including human and animal sacrifices (Cieza de Leon 1963 [1538]; Cobo 1990 [1653]). Unfor tunately, there is little archaeological evidence to corroborate these Inca religious activities. Did they actually happen, or do they represent a barbarous Inca world, as described by literate foreign invaders, or an idealized past recounted by indigenous descendents? Although there are seeming archae ological parallels (Bourget 2001; Hocquenghem J. Maria Toyne ■ University of Central Florida, Department of Anthropology, 4000 Central Florida Blvd., Howard Phillips Hall Room 309, Orlando, FL 32816-1361 (j.marla.toyne@ucf.edu) Latin American Antiquity 22(4), 2011, pp. 505-523 Copyright ©2011 by the Society for American Archaeology 505</page><page sequence="2">506 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22. No. 4, 2011 2009), we cannot transpose these beliefs and behav iors directly onto earlier extinct cultures in differ ent regions of the Andes. However, these indirect sources of past ritual life remain valuable tools. More recent work by Verano (1995; 2001a; 2005; 2007) on the north coast of Peru has identified uncontestable physical evidence of ritual death and complex corporeal mutilation among some early pre-Hispanic societies. This paper uses bioarchaeological indicators of perimortem manipulation and postmortem treat ment of the victims to identify distinct types of rit ual activities. These patterned behaviors reflect specific sacrifice practices, including bloodletting, organ extraction, and decapitation. The remains from the Temple of the Sacred Stone at Tücume provide physical evidence of ritual behaviors asso ciated with human sacrifice, whose meaning can be explored through an understanding of Andean symbolic ideology and religious traditions. Ritual Violence Reconstructing ritual behaviors in the archaeolog ical record is a challenge, as the sacredness of rites is created through shared social action and beliefs, which are not directly preserved. Even though rit uals can be difficult to identify, archaeologists can use pattern recognition and symbolic features to locate ritual spaces and residues of activities per formed there (Andrews and Bello 2006; Kyriakidis 2007; Renfrew 1985). Rituals, defined as formal social acts based on traditional beliefs that func tion to create communication between the human world and the spirit or supernatural world, play important roles in creating social cohesion and re enforcing power structures (Douglas 1972; Bell 1997; Hastorf 2001). Even with the symbolically motivated behavior associated with human burials, the complexities of pre- and post-funerary rites may not be fully rep resented in cemetery contexts (Buikstra and Nys trom 2003). Archaeologists can identify particular spaces as loci of symbolic and ritual performance based on specific features including architecture (temples, special walkways, etc.) and the placement of ritual symbols and objects (Inomata and Coben 2006; Moore 2004; Silverman 1994). Sacrifice is a particular type of complex ritual action that involves offering something of value within a symbolic system (Turner 1977). Otterings are usually destroyed or transformed in some way so that they become accessible to the supernatural world. Valeri (1985:37), for example, defines sac rifice as "any ritual action that includes the conse cration of an 'offering' to a deity" and in which the offering is made of "one or more individuals belonging to a species with symbolic values exploited in the course of the ritual". A sacrificial offering is made as a means of communicating with supernatural forces in an attempt to influence them on behalf of human societies by giving with the hope of receiving in kind (Hubert and Mauss 1964[ 1898]). The human body is a complex organism and can be transformed in a ritualized manner to reflect sig nificant social meaning (Sofaer 2006). Individual human products such as blood, semen, or body parts can be sacrificed, but human life is consid ered the most valuable of sacrifices (Valeri 1985). Death can be administered in many ways but the additional manipulation of the body and its parts may have specific symbolic meaning that can be inferred from the cultural context. Ritual Death in the Andes Ritually motivated violence, including sacrifice, falls under the category of socially sanctioned actions, where individual deaths are conceptually acceptable within a particular context. Ritual death can be a religious act involving reciprocal exchange between humans and the gods (Bloch 1992) or an act of political power that reinforces social order and hierarchy (Kertzer 1988). In the Andes, where human sacrifice may have been practiced for thou sands of years, researchers suggest that these two purposes are not necessarily mutually exclusive (Arnold and Hastorf 2008; Ramirez 2005). Ceruti (1999), for example, explains Inca child sacrifices on mountain summits in terms of the the ory of social conflict. She argues that the ritual of human sacrifice, while still serving a religious func tion, played an important role in Inca conquest and domination of distant territories but may also have served local resistance strategies. Swenson (2003) also contends that as early as the Early Intermedi ate Period, the Moche had a social structure in which it was difficult to separate displays of polit ical power from ritual performance. Moche fine line paintings depict the cups of human sacrificial</page><page sequence="3">Toyne] INTERPRETATIONS OF PRE-HISPANIC RITUAL VIOLENCE 507 blood being presented to elaborately dressed indi viduals on elevated platforms. Only certain indi viduals had the right or privilege to accept the sacrificial blood reflecting elite control of ritual offerings (Arsenault 2001). Ritual violence in the Andes has been identified in various forms, including dedicatory sacrifices or retainer burials (Verano 1995). prisoner sacrifice (Verano 2001 b), and taking of trophy heads in either military or ritual events (Forgey and Williams 2003; Tung 2008). Verano (2001b; 2005) and Bourget's (2001) work at the Early Intermediate Period (A ,D. 100-800) site of Huacas de Moche on the north coast in the Moche Valley have brought to light an important example of manipulation of a large num ber of human bodies in complex and symbolic ways associated with ritual structures. A detailed analy sis of the cut mark morphology and patterning by Hamilton (2005) investigated the tools and tech niques used in human sacrifice during Moche times. She analyzed the skeletal evidence for sys tematic throat-slitting, defleshing, dismemberment, decapitation, and trophy-taking related to ritual prisoner sacrifice. While victims were always young adult men, there was variation in treatment and thus ritual practice over time (Verano 2009). These studies and others (Klaus et al. 2010; Ver ano and Toyne 2004) demonstrate the importance of detailed skeletal analyses of perimortem trauma and mortuary analysis in determining the events surrounding death. Archaeological Context On the Pacific coast of modern day Peru, the envi ronment is rich in well-preserved archaeological sites, especially on the arid coastal plain west of the Andean Mountains (Figure 1). Tücume is a large archaeological complex located in the north within the larger Lambayeque River Valley Com plex. The site is identifiable in the flat surrounding landscape due to the prominence of the natural rock outcropping of Cerro La Raya. The 26 large hua cas or platform mounds of mud bricks encircle the cerro, creating a ceremonial and administrative core. Monumental construction occurred during the earliest Lambayeque (also known as the Sicän cul ture [Shimada 2000]) occupation around A.D. 1000-1100 (Narväez 1995a). Around A.D. 1350, the site was incorporated into the Chimu Empire, which expanded from the south to control almost the entire northern coastal region. In approximately A.D. 1470, the Inca conquered the region, leaving clear evidence of their presence at the site. Finally, in A.D. 1532 the Spanish arrived on the northern coast of Peru and the site was burned and aban doned soon after (Cieza de Leon 1984 [ 1553]). Of the twenty-six platforms, those excavated reveal evidence of both elite residential and ceremonial architecture on their summits, suggesting that polit ical and religious authority were linked and that the site was administered by a powerful minority (Narväez 1995a). Evidence of these three distinct cultural occu pations (through distinct offerings and structural modification) is found at the Temple of the Sacred Stone (TPS), located just east of the base of the largest platform mounds (Narväez 1995a). There is a large, vertically implanted, stone enclosed within its walls. This one-ton monolith of volcanic basalt rock quarried from the cerro directly behind it. Its position and orientation suggest that it rep resents a scaled-down version of the cerro, or even the massive Andean mountains further to the east. Traditional Andean beliefs hold the mountains as sacred ancestors who have powerful influence over daily existence. The peaks are the source of both the sun rising from the east and the rivers that bring water to irrigate coastal agricultural fields (Allen 1988; Bolin 1998; Tierney 1989). Prehistorically, mountains also appear to have been revered as important sources of supernatural power by both highland and coastal peoples (Ceruti 2001; Zighel boim 1995). Early Moche built a patio on Huaca de la Luna to include a natural rock outcropping within that sacred space (Bourget 1997; Uceda 1999). Some monolithic stones, called huancas, were regarded as lithified ancestors to whom reg ular offerings were made beginning perhaps as early as the Preceramic (Shady 1997) through Incan times (Duviols 1979). Offering caches from Chimu and Inca occupa tions were found within the Temple structure, including thousands of miniature gold and silver artifacts in the shape of elite objects of power. Small human figurines called conopa are also included as offerings. These are best known from their direct association with Inca high-altitude child sacrifices in the southern highlands (Reinhard 2005).

Excavations focused on determining the extent and nature of the burials associated with the temple and interpreting the patterns in mortuary behavior. Skeletal remains including a minimum of 110 humans (adults and subadults) and approximately 41 juvenile camelids (Llama sp.) were recovered (Figure 2). There were seven other sets of human skeletal remains from earlier excavations for a total</page><page sequence="6">510 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 of 117 individuals. Due to variable preservation, however, only 95 were observable for detailed oste ological analysis. The burials were primary depo sitions but occasionally pits were disturbed, either partially or completely, by subsequent interments, resulting in some incomplete and disarticulated skeletal remains. The original pit occupant's skele ton was often reintegrated into the pit fill on top of the newly deposited individual. Many graves con tained multiple individuals, each representing a separate burial event and pit reuse. Figures 3a and 3b demonstrate how, in pit 54, one individual (EH67) was placed supine, with his legs crossed, on top of the skeletal remains of EH71 (also supine, legs crossed). However, at the time of EH67's inter ment, EH71 was already skeletonized and only the right forearm (radius and ulna) and part of the right hand were disturbed. Based on the number of remains and stage of decomposition and disartic ulation, estimates predict bodies could skeletonize in their burial environment in as little as a couple months to a couple years (Galloway et al. 1989; Nelson 1998; Toyne 2009). Estimates therefore could aliow up to a possible maximum of 100 years of sacrificial use if an annual event, although the timeframe may be narrower. Surface erosion and superposition created chal lenges for dating some of the burials. We correlated the patio occupational surfaces to the archaeolog ical floors and chronology described for the tem ple (Narväez 1995b). Radiocarbon dating of the Temple floors indicates that a few burials (n = 5) date to the Chimü Phase (~A.D. 1350 to A.D. 1470), although most (n = 29) date to the later Inca occupation (A.D. 1470 to A.D. 1532) (Toyne 2009). One human burial was dated to 680±40 B.P. (Beta 213693; bone collagen), or cal A .D. 1270-1230 or cal A.D. 1340-1390 (calibrated at 2a with the pro gram CALIB 3.2 [Stuiveretal. 1998]).' It appears that human sacrifices began during the Chimü occupation and continued into the Inca occupation; conquest by these two foreign sociopolitical pow ers appears to have had little impact on the sacred nature of the Temple of the Sacred Stone. Valuable offerings to the temple began during the Late Inter mediate Period Lambayeque occupation around A.D. 1000, but with the Chimü evolved to include human lives. Materials and Methods The bioarchaeological approach integrates both mortuary data and biological aspects of human skeletal remains (Larsen 1997), and creates a con textually based interpretation (Buikstra and Beck 2006).The burial analysis included recording char acteristics of pit dimensions, orientation, depth, and contents as well as body and limb placement, positioning, and orientation within the pit. Skeletal remains were used to construct victim profiles of age and sex, physical morphology, and pathological conditions based on accepted stan dards (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Ubelaker 1989). These profiles serve to reconstruct the bio logical life histories of the individuals and allow interpretations of victims' identity. Ritual activity "signatures" were modeled based on the location, distribution, and extent of surface modification (i.e., cut marks and perimortem fractures) on bones. It is important to consider the relationship of the cut marks to overlying soft tissue structures and the orientation and force applied to create these incisions. Since the overlying soft tissues were not preserved, it is possible to underestimate the degree of manipulation. Methods used to record cut mark frequency and distribution included: (1) calculating the number of skeletal elements with cut marks; (2) calculating the number of individuals with cuts; and (3) illustrative recording of the anatomical location of cuts. All cut marks were observed using both the naked eye and a lOx hand lens. The skeletons represented varying degrees of completeness (100 percent, n = 57; &gt;50 percent, n = 31; &lt; 50 percent, n = 22) and therefore observations were based on total number of observ able skeletal elements. Those individuals that were disturbed often had bones missing but we also iden tified three large clusters of disarticulated, mixed skeletal remains that may have been "clean up" pits containing possible matches to missing elements from nearby, only slightly disturbed contexts (including bones with cut marks). No specific skele tal element was underrepresented in a way that would suggest trophy collecting. Counts of cut marks can be subjective since a single stroke may "skip" a section of bone leaving two separate marks with an untouched area between them.

In most cases, individuals with multiple cuts had numerous parallel incisions that were clearly the result of separate strokes or sawing back and forth across the same area. Table 1.

The human bodies were supine, head to the east, feet to the west (except in one case where the head was towards the north). Where body position could be determined, some individuals were extended (n = 22) and others had their legs flexed tightly to their bodies (n = 20), or legs crossed and flexed (n = 30) (Figure 3a and b), with arms placed beside or across the torso. Even when the head had been separated from the body, it was placed within the pit approximately in anatomical position. There was a significant dif ference between adult and child burial positions (X2 = 6.876, df- 1; p = .032), where adults were more likely to have their legs flexed or crossed, and subadults were more often extended. This suggests pit length may have been a factor in determining burial position, (most pits averaged 1.13 cm [+ .39] in length) rather than any other symbolic or cul tural determinate. The distribution of adults and children burials is generally even across the patio. While it appears there are more adults in the north east quadrant furthest from the Temple entrance, this relationship does not reach significance (x2 = 7.786, &lt;#'= 3, p = .051). Notably there were no artifacts directly associ ated with individual burials. There was evidence that each body (including camelids) was wrapped in a single simple shroud of woven cotton, though these were very poorly preserved and often only the imprint remained. Scattered on the floors within the patio area, we found two complete Spondylus calcifer2 shells that were broken in half, a few iso lated fragments of Spondylus, a copper plate (likely from an article of clothing), a ceramic crisole (small pinch-pot clay vessel likely used for the offerings of chicha beer) and a small Conus sp. shell carved in the shape of a fish. Each of these artifacts has direct connections to ritualized activities (Costin 1999; Narväez 1995a). Demography. Age distribution of the sample included subadults (n = 47,42.7 percent) as young as four or five years of age and adults (n = 63,57.3 percent) as old as 50 years of age (Table 1). All the adults and older adolescents were male, except for two disarticulated burials of adult females (one mid dle-aged adult and one adult of unknown age), who are not included in this analysis as they appear to be secondary offerings and were treated distinctly. Perimortem Trauma. Surface modification of bone is consistent with perimortem sharp force trauma, where the cuts were made at or around the time of death with no evidence of healing. There were a total of 267 skeletal elements with evidence of cut marks from 95 individuals complete enough for observation. These were located on thirteen separate bones of the upper chest and neck region, including the first through seventh cervical verte bra, first thoracic vertebrae, both clavicles, both first ribs and the manubrium portion of the sternum (Table 2a, Figure 4a and b). Cuts were made perpendicular to the surface of the bones (Figure 4a) and were very fine incisions with straight, parallel margins suggesting the use of a thin, single-edged implement (Walker and Long 1977). In some cases, enough force was applied to completely bisect elements in a single stroke (Figure 4b). No knives or cutting imple ments were found at the site, but an analogy can be made with Hamilton's (2005) data, suggesting these cuts were likely made by a long, beveled edge, metal instrument. From other prehispanic north coast contexts, we know there were crescent shaped metal blades called tumi knives associated with sacrificial activities and severed heads (Cordy Col lins 2001). In only one case at the temple is there clear evidence of perimortem serrated-cut mark margins more consistent with a stone implement with an irregular flaked edge, and these were found on the neck vertebra of an isolated severed head found in a post hole within the temple entrance way (Narväez 1995a: 113).</page><page sequence="9">Toyne] INTERPRETATIONS OF PRE-HISPANIC RITUAL VIOLENCE 513 Table 2.

Only six individuals lacked evidence of cut marks even though they were interred in the same manner as all the mutilated individuals. It is possible to cut the throat of an individual without striking the bone and therefore this activity may be underrepresented. At the same time, other methods of killing such as poison, strangulation, or being buried alive are also associated with sacrificial practices (Besom 2009; Reinhard 2005). m Figure 4. Images of skeletal elements with cut marks indi cated: (a) EH39 (adult) upper cervical vertebrae CI through C4 with multiple cuts (indicated by arrows) across the anterior surface of the bodies, articular facets and dens process; (b) EH 16 (subadult) manubrium bisected vertically across left side with a single stroke. Although some skeletal elements demonstrated only a single cut, most bones demonstrated numer ous cuts (Table 2b). The most frequently struck element was the third cervical vertebrae (50.7 per cent), followed by the left clavicle (41.1 percent). The left clavicle was also the element most likely to be cut multiple times. In this sample, 89 out of the 95 individuals with neck and upper thoracic skeletal elements have cut marks present (93.7 percent), and there is no dif ference in their number and frequency between adults (94.2 percent) and subadults (93.0 percent). Additionally, there were perimortem fractures (complete and incomplete) of the first and occa sionally second ribs near the surgical neck (first ribs n = 48 of 87,54.0 percent). There was only a sin gle fracture per element. Although both sides were broken, the right was fractured more frequently than the left (x2 = 6.02, df = 1, p &lt; 0.02). There was no statistical difference in breakage patterns between the adults (n = 28) and subadults (n = 20). Discussion Anatomical Interpretation The location of cut marks indicates three separate activity signatures: cutting the throat, severing the head from the neck, and opening the chest cavity (Figure 5). The cut mark morphology and fractures are consistent with perimortem insults when the bone was vital or recently vital. Sharp force trauma to any of these areas would have been fatal and thus a posible cause of death. Throat Cutting. Cut marks predominate across the bones at the base of the neck (first ribs, clavi cles, and cervical vertebra) and are consistent with deep horizontal slicing across the base of the ante rior throat. The knife struck the bones to either or both sides of the neck (first ribs and clavicles), which suggests a wrap-around stroke from shoul der-to-shoulder. Incisions across the anterior sur faces of the cervical bodies require deep penetration, and likely severed many of the major structures of the throat - including the carotid artery, jugular vein, esophagus, trachea, etc. If either of the large blood vessels were cut, there would be massive and rapid blood loss. It is likely that draw ing and collecting large quantities of blood (thus</page><page sequence="11">Toyne] INTERPRETATIONS OF PRE-HISPANIC RITUAL VIOLENCE 515 Figure 5. Illustration of human skeleton upper thorax with three activity signature indicating trajectories of cut marks across specific skeletal elements. killing the victim) was the objective of cutting the throat. When cuts were identified across the upper neck region but the skull was still in correct anatomical position, it is presumed that the intention was to cut the throat and not decapitate the individual. Remarkably, when the head is in the fully extended position the sternocleidomastoid muscles shift and provide a shield over the vital structures of the throat along the base and side of the neck (Snell 2003). A single stroke over the surface of the neck in this position would likely not be fatal as the carotid or jugular blood vessels would not be dam aged. Therefore, if the head were in an extended position, additional cuts or greater force would be required to bisect the covering muscle and soft tis sue structures. The multiple incisions and depth of penetration found at the Temple could reflect the body positioning of the victims, head back, either kneeling or supine, during the sacrifice ceremony (Figure 6). Opening the Chest Cavity. A predominance of cuts ran vertically and ventrally close to the mid line of the chest. Many of these cuts struck the proximal ends of the clavicles and frequently bisected the manubrium, usually to one side or the other, and based on their trajectory would have Figure 6. Chiniü period (A.D. 1000-1470) ceramic vessel of human figure holding the hair of prone victim in one hand and a tumi knife to the throat in the other hand (Museo Rafael Larco, Lima. Adapted image courtesy of L. Engel, photographer) continued down through the unpreserved costal cartilage. It is likely these cuts were created to access the chest cavity, possibly to remove the heart or lungs. The fractures of the first and second ribs are associated with the hyperextension of the costal vertebral joints as the anterior or sternal aspect of the thoracic cavity was elevated or laterally sepa rated. However, no cuts were observed on the inter nal surfaces of the ribs or anterior thoracic vertebral bodies to suggest organs were cut out (Robicsek and Hales 1984; Tiesler and Cucina 2006). Decapitation. Finally, horizontal cuts across the upper cervical vertebrae (CI through C4), often bisecting the vertebral uncus, bodies, and articular surfaces, are consistent with completely severing the head from the neck just below the chin. The anterior location of the cuts suggests that cutting proceeded from the front to the back, and the prox imity to the cervical-occipital junction indicates that the head was in a fully extended position.

Although it is possible to cause death when cut ting the throat without striking bone, it is nearly impossible to decapitate an individual without leav ing a mark on the skeleton. At the same time, if the preferred method of accessing the chest cavity is to start at one side of the sternal notch, it seems unlikely that the chest cavity could be opened with out leaving cut marks on the skeleton. Table 3 summarizes the frequency of individu als with these cut mark signatures: 60 individuals (63.2 percent) had their throat cut; 72 individuals (75.8 percent) were decapitated; and 67 individu als (70.5 percent) had their chest opened. Most individuals, however, experienced more than one type of trauma and almost one-third demonstrated evidence of all three. This pattern of multiple activ ity signatures is similar both for adults and chil dren in the sample. Ritual Sequence For those individuals with multiple injuries related to different activities, it is possible to propose a rit ual sequence. Table 4 presents all the possible sequences for the three activities. It seems unlikely that the throat was cut after decapitation, so there are several options that can be disregarded (Options D, E, and F). Generally, if spilling or collecting blood in a receptacle for further use in ritual was the most important goal then the cuts would have been made on the living, as seen in Moche iconog raphy (Bourget and Newman 1998). With Option A or B, once the blood was collected the other dis membering activities could then follow. On the other hand, if there was a symbolic importance to removing the still-beating heart, as is suggested by ethnohistoric and ethnographic studies (Miller 1977; Nachtigall 1975), then perhaps the chest was opened first, followed by cutting the throat to acquire blood and finally decapitation (Option C). However, once the chest was cut open the victim would be dead and there would be no blood flow and thus little reason to cut the neck. At the same time, once dead through exsanguination, heart removal could still occur but without the possibil ity of a still-palpating organ, thus reducing the dra matic impact (Option A or B). Option A appears to be the most parsimonious explanation for the suc cession of events if blood flow was important and Option C if the beating heart was the goal. These options leave severing the head from the body as likely the final activity performed. Ritual Violence at the Temple of the Sacred Stone These data allow us to reconstruct ritual practices involving the regular ritual killing of men and chil dren at the Temple of the Sacred Stone as a cohe sive religious tradition.

Possible? Unlikely Unlikely Unlikely the actions resulting in these ritual deaths were car ried out somewhere else at the site and the bodies brought to the patio in front of the temple for inter ment, this seems unlikely given the centralized placement of the rock and associated altars, which suggests that the activities were part of this ritual landscape (Moore 2004; Swenson 2003). The patterning of perimortem trauma is consis tent with definitions of sacrificial offerings of human beings and their body parts, and the volume of remains demonstrates a fairly long and contin uous history of practice. At the Temple of the Sacred Stone, there were three different ritual activity sig natures marking the removal of a vital part of the body: blood, heart, and head. Andean ethnohistory and ethnography enable us to explore the symbolic importance of each ritual signature and its possi ble social significance. Cutting the Throat—Bloodletting Blood played an important role in Andean ritual. Classen (1993) describes blood as a preeminent symbol of passage and transition. In the Moche fineline illustration of the Presentation Theme (Fig ure 7), one of the individuals in the lower register is cutting the throat of a bound individual and hold ing a cup in the other hand. It is argued that the cup of collected blood is then presented to an anthro pomorphized supernatural, Figure A, in the upper register. De Bock (2005) argues that blood is a metaphor for water, and that spilling of blood will induce the water to flow from the mountains, sig naling the start of the rainy season. Information from the chronicles also describes the importance of blood and its distribution in fourteenth and fifteenth century Inca rituals. Xerez (1872 [ 1534]) states that blood was used to anoint the faces of the idols and the doors of the temples, as well as the sepulchers of the dead. Murua (1987 [1590]) explains that the priests also transported blood from animal sacrifices in jars for offering to huacas as part of the ceremonial procession that led the capac hucha child sacrifices to their deaths. Some huacas included the mummified bodies or stone representations of ancestral remains. These huacas were ritually fed blood by being anointed with it, in the hope that thus satisfied they would use their supernatural powers to support the state and to fulfill the wishes of the Inca (Classen 1993). Modern ethnographies describe the use and importance of blood in rituals as necessary offer ings (Bolin 1998;Gose 1994). Over 60 percent of the victims at the Temple of the Sacred Stone had their throats slit. Since it is possible to cut an indi vidual's throat and cause a fatal injury without striking the bone, this frequency may have been even higher. Whether the blood was collected is unknown, but seems likely since this act appears to have been the first part of a series of ritual activ ities. At Punta Lobos, there was also evidence of consistent cutting of the throats of a large num ber of boys and men dating to A.D. 1250-1350 (Verano and Toyne 2004), but the mortuary treat ment there included blindfolds and bound hands, and there was no relationship to ceremonial archi tecture and no evidence of decapitation, all of which may suggest that slitting of the throat was simply the means of secular execution. Chest Cavity Opening—Organ Removal In general, surgical removal ot the heart is difficult due to its protected location within the chest cav ity, with the sternum in the front and ribs all around. It is held in place by large blood vessels and strong pericardial tissues (Robicsek and Hales 1984; Snell 2003). Researchers have proposed a number of dif ferent methods for accessing the heart, based on osteological evidence (Pijoan Aguade and Mansilla Lory 2004; Tiesler and Cucina 2006). In Mesoamerica, in addition to physical evidence, iconography demonstrates that heart removal was a common ritual activity using the subcostal and intercostal methods of removal (Robicsek and Hales 1984; Tiesler and Cucina 2006). Unlike the</page><page sequence="14">518 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 7. Illustration of Mochc Period (A.D. 100-800) ceramic flneline drawing of the "Presentation Theme" with bound prisoner having his throat slit identified in the lower register (Donnan and McClelland 1999:Figure 4.102, with permis sion of authors). Maya and Aztec cultures of Mesoamerica, there are no clear iconographic representations of heart sac rifice in the Andes. The pattern of sternal cuts found at Tucume has been identified at other sites in coastal Peru and interpreted to represent possible heart removal (Klaus et al. 2010; Verano 1986). Verano (1986) identified cuts on the manubria of five individuals and multiple cervical fractures of the ribs, which supported the idea that the anterior chest had been opened completely. Since at the Temple of the Sacred Stone fractures are limited to the first ribs, the rib cage seems to have been spread apart just enough to allow access to the chest in order to observe, or remove, the heart or lungs. Although an aperture is created in the anterior chest wall along the mid-line of the body, there is no direct evidence that the goal was to remove the heart or any other specific organ in the chest. The hypothesis of heart removal comes from secondary sources. Ethnohistonc documents describing Inca prac tices discuss heart removal as aform of human sac rifice (Murua 1987 [1590]) and as a method of punishment (Betanzos 1996 [1557]). Molina (1963 [ 1575]:55) described heart sacrifice at Huanacaure near Cusco: Y a otros sacaban los corazones, vivos, y asf con ellos palpitando, les ofrecian a las gua cas a quien se haci'a el sacrificio y con la san gre untaban casi de oreja a oreja el rostro de la guaca, a lo cual llaman 'pirac', y a otros daban el cuerpo con la dicha sangre; y asi enterraban los cuerpos juntamente con los demds sacrificios. Of others [children] they removed the living hearts, and still beating, they offered them to the huacas to whom the sacrifice was dedicated and with the blood they anointed the face of the huaca almost from ear to ear, calling this 'pirac' and they covered the bodies of others with the aforementioned blood. They then buried the bodies together with the other sac rifices [translation by author]. Andean ethnographic research has also reported the removal of the still beating heart as a part of llama sacrifice (Gose 1994; Miller 1977). In the southern highlands at Chumbivilcas, the number of palpitations after extraction was used to predict the fortune of a recently married couple. The removal of llama lungs for divination may have been practiced similarly on humans (Betanzos 1996 [1557]). Ethnohistoric documents suggest the organ (heart or lung) was usually burned and the body was buried or burned at the end of the ritual (Molina 1963 [1575]). At the Temple, there were no spe cific hearth or burnt areas identified in or near the temple structure. The hearts may have been buried, disposed of elsewhere, or replaced within the chest (as the severed heads were repositioned).</page><page sequence="15">Toyne] INTERPRETATIONS OF PRE-HISPANIC RITUAL VIOLENCE 519 Although the head is represented frequently in iconography, the symbolism and importance of the heart is less clear. Body fragmentation is evident in the relief artwork at Cerro Sechin (ca. 1500 B .C.) and in trophy heads of the south coast Nasca (A.D. 1-500). With these and other examples, Arnold and Hastorf (2008) argue that the symbolism of sev ered heads (at least) was linked to political forma tion where control of the head reflected control over the entire social and political body. In a sim ilar fashion we can infer that heart and blood removal may have been symbolically linked in sim ilar ways as vital essences that were required for both biological and social maintenance. Decapitation—Head Removal The decapitator theme was prevalent in the iconog raphy of many different pre-Hispanic cultures beginning as early as 1500 B .C. (Benson 2001). The head appears to have had special importance in Andean ideology, based on repeated iconographic and archaeological finds. Verano (200la: 172) describes decapitation at the hands of a supernat ural figure as the "quintessential signifier of ritual death in the Andean world". During earlier Nasca and Moche times, severed heads were illustrated in iconography with supernatural-like figures hold ing a tumi blade in one hand and a severed head in the other, or as disembodied heads in association with the sacrifice theme (Verano et al. 1999). Exam ples of decapitation in Chimü iconography do not depict a deity, but a human, holding a knife in one hand, standing over a prone victim and holding the head up to expose the throat (Figure 6). There is a representational change in who is doing the decap itating (from an anthropomorphic creature to a human figure), which may suggest an ideological shift in who controls or determines the rituals. This artistic representation may demonstrate only cut ting the throat, not decapitation, but either or both are possible outcomes. The Inca believed that passage into the afterlife required a complete corpse, in addition to grave offerings (Betanzos 1996 [1557]). Decapitation was considered a punishment during Inca times for severe crimes, such as mutiny, or after battle to defile the enemy's remains (Betanzos 1996 [1557]; Cieza de Leon 1963 [1538]; Ogburn 2007). When Atahualpa was captured by the Spanish and con demned to die, he chose to be baptized so that his body would not be burned and not able to partici pate in the afterlife. However, the Spanish garroted him and not only physically cut off his head, but also symbolically decapitated the Inca state (Classen 1993). At the Temple ot the Sacred Stone, individuals were decapitated, but the goal was not the removal of the head for a trophy or for long-term display or other use. The only exceptions were the three cra nia (two clearly decapitated) buried within the tem ple . Their bodies may have been interred in the patio area, although it was not possible to match them to specific headless skeletons (individuals who were missing their crania through burial pit disturbance). Severing the head was part of the complex ritual mutilation, but once completed, the head was returned to its body for burial. This fact raises the question: Why remove the head at all? Why go to such effort to cut through the neck, only to put it back? Removal of the head may have been more important as a symbolic action; the goal was to destroy or transform the body in order for the rit ual to achieve efficacy (Bloch 1992; Hill 2000). Yet, the final mortuary treatment of the offering or deceased appears to have required that the body be buried as a whole entity, perhaps to maintain its inclusive ritual value. Reincorporation of the indi vidual within the burial and careful placement of the body seem to run counter to expectations for the destructive nature of punishment as described for later Inca times. Punishment, at least during Inca times, would have resulted in mortuary deposits more consistent with Duncan's (2005) category of "violation" rather than the features consistent with "veneration" found here at the temple. It is not impossible that these remains were from executions involving highly complex and symbolically per formed rites that placed the remains of the trans gressors in close proximity to such a sacred site; this explanation, however, seems unlikely. Three separate ritual actions were performed, frequently to the same individual, including cutting the throat, opening the chest cavity, and completely separating the head from the body. Most individu als have evidence of all three, suggesting these activities were performed together as part of the same ritual sequence. Individuals who did not demonstrate all three activities may have been a part of earlier or later, less elaborate, version of the same ritual, or perhaps reflect distinct religious events.</page><page sequence="16">520 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 The comparable treatment of their remains sug gests, at a minimum, a similar type of symbolic tra dition related to the use and function of the temple. had to be whole before placed in their prepared offering pit. This research presents a distinctive set of mor tuary features and scale of ritual violence previ ously unseen in the Andes, yet not completely unique when compared to other recent discoveries across the region. Human sacrifice was rare, but as these ritualized deaths demonstrate, it was carefully performed and repeated as an integrated part of social reproduction, often linked to elite power and status. Even if we broadly estimate one victim per year for 100 years, these deaths may have been linked to important calendrical events and thus inte grated into social experience. The detailed skeletal analysis of perimortem treatment and manipulation of the large number of victims at Tücume's Temple of the Sacred Stone, possibly over an extended period of time, identifies elaborate ritual behaviors whose performance was required on a regular basis to maintain spiritual and perhaps social stability. The role of human sacrifice within ritual prac tice may be related to the quest for agricultural fer tility, if these oblations were immolated on a regular basis, perhaps in relation to seasonal events, such as planting or harvesting. Swenson (2003) for example, suggests that in the Andes violent death represented 'life given' in order to get 'life back' in the form of agricultural production, human repro duction , and cosmological order. Similar arguments have been made for Moche sacrifice based on iconographic representations (Bourget 2001; de Bock 2005; Hocquenghem 2009). The cyclical and regular nature of agricultural processes provides specifically timed events for seeking supernatural affirmation through sacrifice and blood offerings. Rituals related to sacrificial death are difficult to reconstruct in all their intricacies and often are made more challenging by archaeological preser vation or taphonomic processes. With the present data I outline the possible ritual death sequence per formed at the Tücume's Temple of the Sacred Stone, but also acknowledge that variability in prac tice and meaning may have existed here as much as at other prehispanic Andean sites. Conclusions The skeletal remains from the Temple of the Sacred Stone at T ücume provide clear evidence of repeated ritual ceremonies that involve bloody sacrifice activities beginning during the Late Intermediate Period. Cut marks were identified on the bones of the upper chest and neck, and in almost all cases individuals demonstrated multiple incisions on sev eral skeletal elements. There was no difference in the treatment of adult men or children in terms of frequency or location of peri-mortem trauma, which indicates consistency in ritual behaviors regardless of age. Interpretations of the distribution of cuts suggest that blood may have been collected and used for ritual purposes, such as anointing the stone. The benches inside the temple may have been used as altars upon which the internal chest cavity was opened and/or examined, or organs were removed as offerings. Finally, the heads of the vic tims were removed, but just as importantly reartic ulated, perhaps because, conceptually, the bodies Acknowledgments.

Radiocarbon dating of human remains is less than ideal due to the marine reservoir effect of dietary components (marine resources) on the carbon content in the bone tissues. 2. Spondylus calficer, a warm water shell that is only found off the coast of Ecuador, was part of long distance elite trade throughout the Andes and was commonly found in rit ual contexts and high status burials (Cordy-Collins 2001; Narväez 1995a). These shells, worked or natural, are sacred offerings often associated with water symbolism and fertility. Additionally, there is some speculation as to their consump tion during shamanistic rituals (Glowacki 2005).
