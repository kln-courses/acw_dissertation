<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die elamischen Felsreliefs von Kurangun und Naqs-e Rus- tam. By URSULA SEIDL. Iranische Denkmaler, Lieferung 12, Reihe II, Iranische Felsreliefs, H. Berlin: DIETRICH REIMER VERLAG, 1986. Pp. 25 + 18 Tafeln. DM 55. Together with the corpus of Iranian inscriptions, the publication of photographs of monuments of pre-Islamic Iran by the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin is providing systematic collections of source material for the reconstruction of the ancient history of Iran, which can only be praised. The present work gives us excellent photos and discussions of the dating, description of the sites, identities of the figures portrayed, and their place in Elamite rock reliefs so far known. The first site is Kurangun in the Fahliyan valley, and the second is at Naqg-e Rustam beneath a relief of Bahram II, the Sasanian monarch who obliterated most of the earlier relief. Both reliefs are in Fars province. After discussing several opinions about the dating of the religiously inspired Kurangun relief, the author comes to the conclusion that the main part of the relief was carved in the 17th century B.C., but 36 figures of worshippers were added about 1000 B.C., and sometime later four more figures were added. The Naqg-e Rustam relief originally had two coiled snake thrones, whereas Kurangun had only one, with a god sitting on it. In Naqg-e Rustam the dating is suggested to be between the 17th and 12th centuries B.C., more likely the former, while later one or two worshippers were added to the left of the original relief. The author suggests that the model for both reliefs and other Elamite reliefs elsewhere may have been cylinder seals. Further, in regard to the added figures, she suggests that, since about the year 1000 B.C. in Babylonia and Assyria there was a reaction against portraying gods in anthropomorphic form, the same may have existed in Elam, although older reliefs were not destroyed, but rather figures were added to the old reliefs-a reasoning I fail to follow. Added to the work is a stone from the vicinity of Kurangun with a common Pahlavi funerary inscription read by P. 0. Skjaerv0. RICHARD N. FRYE HARVARD UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
